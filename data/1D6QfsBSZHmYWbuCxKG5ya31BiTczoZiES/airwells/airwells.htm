      <p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Humans</b> must drink about a gallon of
        water every day to remain alive. Modern urbanites easily consume
        100 gal/day&nbsp; by bathing, laundering, and watering lawns,
        etc. If groundwater or rain is not available, there are several
        little-known alternative methods to obtain fresh water by
        condensing atmosphere humidity. We live in a dilute ocean of
        aerial moisture. There are also real "sky rivers" full of fresh
        water from which we can draw. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1993, Reginald E. Newell (M.I.T.), <i>et
          al</i>., found 10 huge filamentary structures that are the
        preferable pathways of water vapor movement in the troposphere
        (the lower 10-20 km of the atmosphere) with flow rates of about
        165 million kilograms of water per second. These "atmospheric
        rivers" are bands from 200 to 480 miles wide and up to 4,800
        miles long, between 1-2 kilometers above the earth. They
        transport about 70% of the fresh water from the equator to the
        midlatitudes, are of great importance in determining the
        location and amount of winter rainfall on coastlines. (Ref 1) </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to Newell, "A typical flow in
        [the] South American tropospheric river is very close to that in
        the Amazon (about 165 x 106 kg sec<sup>-1</sup>). There are
        typically five rivers leading into the middle latitudes of the
        Southern Hemisphere and four or five leading into the Northern
        Hemisphere. The rivers persist for 10 days or more while being
        translated generally eastward at speeds of 6 m/sec<sup>-1</sup>."

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Approximately 3,100 cubic miles of water is
        in the atmosphere at any said time, 98% in the form of vapor, 2%
        in clouds. About 280 cubic miles of water evaporate or transpire
        into the atmosphere each day. A cubic mile of water contains
        over one trillion gallons. The continental USA receives about 4
        cubic miles of rainfall daily. More than 2,000,000 cubic miles
        of fresh water is stored in underground aquifers; about 60,000
        cubic miles of fresh water are stored in lakes, inland seas, and
        rivers. About 7,000,000 cubic miles of water are contained in
        glaciers and polar icecaps, and in Greenland. The world’s
        reserves of fresh water are estimated at approximately 35
        million cubic kilometers, including glaciers, ground water,
        wells, rivers, lakes, and precipitation as rain and snow. Yet it
        is inadequate for the ever-increasing, largely unrestrained
        demands of human civilization, so that alternative sources are
        desperately needed. While desalination of seawater is an obvious
        option, as yet the total quantity produced in this way amounts
        to about 10 km<sup>3</sup>, which is only a very small
        percentage of the 3000 cubic km<sup>3</sup> consumed annually. </p>
      <p><b><font size="+1">Mechanical Methods ~</font></b><a

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It should be possible to draw water from
        atmospheric rivers. The engineering problem of reaching that
        height is not insurmountable if the construction is done atop
        mountains in appropriate areas, although the rivers move about
        considerably. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1935, the French meteorologist Bernard
        Dubos proposed the construction of 2,000 ft chimneys to create a
        humid draft from fountains at the base, ejecting it into the
        upper air to increase the saturation and produce rain (Figure
        2). Towers like these also could draw water directly from the
        air at high altitudes by incorporating other inventions, such as
        Oscar Blomgren's Electrostatic Cooling (USP # 3,872,917) or the
        Hilsch-Ranque Vortex Tube (USP # 1,952,281). </p>

          845 )</p>
      </center>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The recent invention of acoustic
        refrigeration probably could be applied for this purpose. Sound
        does in fact produce rain at certain lakes in China's southern
        Yunnan province. People there simply yell for rain. The louder
        they rain, the more it rains, and the longer they yell, the
        longer it rains! This effect is possible because the air there
        is so saturated that sound waves can cause water molecules to
        condense. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Melvin Prueitt's US Patent # 5,483,798 for a
        "Convection Tower" claims to be "capable of cleaning the
        pollution from large quantities of air, of generating
        electricity, and of producing fresh water utilize the
        evaporation of water spayed into the towers to create strong air
        flows and to remove pollution from the air. Turbines in tunnels
        at the base generate electricity, and condensers produce fresh
        water" (See also Prueitt's US Patents # 5,477,684 ~ # 5,395,598
        ~ 5,284,628). (Figure 3) </p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similarly, the "Vortex Engine" invented by
        Louis Marc Michaud (WO 03/025395 ~ US Patent Application #
        2004112055) describes "A tornado-like convective vortex...
        produced by admitting air tangentially in the base of a
        cylindrical wall. The vortex is started by heating the air
        within the circular wall with fuel.&nbsp; The heat required to
        maintain the vortex once established can be the naturally
        occurring heat content of the ambient air, or can be provided in
        a peripheral heart echanger means located outside the circular
        wall. The heat source for the peripheral exchanger can be waste
        industrial heat or warm seawater. The preferred heat exhanger
        means is a crossflow wet cooling tower. The mechanical energy is
        produced in a plurality of peripheral turbines. A vortex engine
        would have a diameter of 400 meters; the vortex could be 100
        meters diameter at its base and extend to a height of 1 to 15
        kilometers; the power putput copuld be in the 100 to 500
        megawatt range. The vortex process could also be used to produce
        precipitation, to cool the invironment, or to clean or elevate
        polluted surface air." (Figure 4) </p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prof. Stephen Salter (Edinburgh University,
        Division of Engineering) has designed a 200 ft high turbine that
        will spray vaporized seawater into the atmosphere and produce
        rain from clouds that do not contain enough moisture to
        precipitate. The British government has provided a grant for its
        construction. Prof. Salter described his invention at the 10th
        Congress of International Maritime Association of the
        Mediterranean (Crete, May 2002): </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The evaporation of water from the sea
        surface is slow and inefficient because of the need for large
        amounts of latent heat and because the perpendicular component
        of turbulence in the air vanishes at the surface leaving a
        stagnant humid layer. The wind has to blow over thousands of
        kilometres of warm sea before it can bring rain. Saudi Arabia is
        dry because the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf are narrow. Chile
        is dry because the Humboldt current is cold. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Calculations show that some remediation may
        be possible using a mechanism that can be controlled to suit
        local needs. This paper describes the design of a floating,
        vertical-axis wind turbine which pumps sea water through the
        humid stagnant layer and sprays it in fine droplets with a large
        increase in surface area. The spray release height is chosen to
        give time for a large fraction of the water to evaporate when
        mixed with air in the turbine wake. The distance from land is
        chosen so that residual very salty drops fall into the sea. The
        humidified air is likely to produce rain when it reaches rising
        ground. The technique allows evaporation from narrow stretches
        of sea with winds blowing over the fetches associated with daily
        sea breezes caused by rising air ashore. Narrow waters can be
        made to behave like much wider oceans with seasonal prevailing
        winds but control remains in the hands of the turbine owners."

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vortex ring generators have been invented
        that project stable doughnut-shaped clouds of smoke for long
        distances. For example, in 1942 Dr Phillips Thomas of the
        Westinghouse company developed a vortex gun that was intended to
        eliminate smoke from factories by shooting it in vortex rings
        high into the atmosphere. US Patent # 3,940,060 was granted to
        Herman Viets in 1976 for a vortex generator that could penetrate
        clouds and atmospheric obstacles such as thermal inversions.
        When used in combination with acoustics, electric charges and
        water vapor or chemicals, this invention could be adapted to
        produce rain. (Figure 6) </p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The "Hail Stop" system invented by Gerald
        Ollivier has received four US Patents (# 3,848,801 ~ # 5,381,955
        ~ # 5,411,209 ~ # 5,445,321), and it is commercially available
        (www.hailstop.com). The invention is "a process and apparatus
        for the transformation of the internal structure of visible
        cloud banks to induce rainfall or snow, or to avoid hailstorms,
        comprising igniting explosive compositions [acetylene] at time
        intervals of less than 25 seconds to create sudden upward
        movement of energy directed to form shock waves at cloud level
        to modify the internal structure of the cloud banks". (Figure 7)

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The great inventor Nikola Tesla published an
        article about "The Wonder World to be Created by Electricity" in
        <i>Manufacturer's Record</i> (September 9, 1915), wherein he
        claimed that, "The time is very near when we shall have the
        precipitation of the moisture of the atmosphere under complete
        control, and then it will be possible to draw unlimited
        quantities of water from the oceans, develop any desired amount
        of energy, and completely transform the globe by irrigation and
        intensive farming. A greater achievement of man through the
        medium of electricity can hardly be imagined". Tesla invented
        the "Magnifying Transmitter" with which to accomplish this feat,
        but he was not able to complete the project. (Figure 8) </p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is in fact possible to influence
        tropospheric rivers by electromagnetic means. The US military
        certainly has been investigating weather modification since the
        1950s. Capt. Howard Orville publicly stated in 1958 that the
        intent was "to manipulate the charges of the earth and sky and
        so affect the weather through electronic beams to ionize and
        de-ionize the atmosphere". That is being done today by the
        notorious American HAARP station at Gakona, Alaska, and smaller
        stations in Greenland and Norway. HAARP currently transmits up
        to 960 KW of energy into the upper atmosphere to produce its
        effects. Increased funding through DARPA will enable the Gakona
        station to increase its power to 3.6 MW by 2006. (Figure 9)

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HAARP (High-Frequency Active Auroral
        Research Program) is a damnable weapon of mass destruction
        (invented by Bernard Eastlund: USP # 4,686,605 ~ # 5,38,664 )
        that contravenes the United Nations "Convention on the
        Prohibition of Military or Any Other Hostile Use of
        Environmental Modification Techniques" (approved in December
        1976). The treaty prohibits "the use of techniques that would
        have widespread, long-lasting or severe effects through
        deliberate manipulation of natural processes and cause such
        phenomena as earthquakes, tidal waves, and <i>changes in
          climate and weather patterns</i>". The US government openly
        advertises its intentions in the publication "Weather as a Force
        Multiplier: Owning the Weather in 2025" by Col. T. House, <i>et
          al</i>. (August 1996) . The report acknowledges that, "The
        difficulty, cost and risk of developing a weather control system
        for military applications [is] extremely high". It justifies the
        effort, however, with the rationale (according to Dr Arnold
        Barnes, who consulted in the study) that the "opportunities to
        capitalize on investment militarily [are] medium/high" and the
        "political implications/health hazards medium/low".

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such military programs also violate the
        National Environmental Protection Act (42 U.S.C. Sec. 4331a),
        the policy of which is to "create and maintain conditions under
        which man and nature can exist in productive harmony." </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the Cold War the Soviet Union
        developed Nikola Tesla's "Magnifying Transmitter" technology to
        a high degree and weaponized it. Tesla had discovered that
        atmospheric ionization could be altered by low frequency radio
        waves (10-80 Hz). The Soviets built Tesla transmitters at
        Angarsk and Khabarovsk (Siberia), Riga (Latvia), Gomel, Sakhalin
        Island, Nikolayev (Ukraine). The transmitter at Riga was moved
        to Bejucal, about 60 miles south of Havana, Cuba. The
        coordinated operation of these transmitters apparently caused
        the long drought in California during the 1980s by creating a
        high pressure ridge about 800 miles off the coast of California
        and forcing it to remain there for several months. Another such
        "blocking pattern" that was held in position for 6 weeks caused
        severe flooding in the Midwest USA in 1993. Some investigators
        have claimed that the flooding was caused by an experiment
        involving the GWEN (Ground Wave Emergency Network) transmitters,
        which comprise an emergency commnication system that would be
        immune to electromagnetic pulse in the event of a nuclear war. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since 1992, the Russian company Elate
        Intelligence Technologies, Inc. has demonstrated its ability to
        radio-control rainfall on demand over an area of 200 square
        miles. The corporate slogan is "Weather made to order". An Elate
        weather-control system is in operation at Moscow's Bykovo
        Airport. The <i>New York Times</i> (Sept. 24, 1992) reported
        that some Russian farmers were using the technology to improve
        their crops. Elate executive Igor Pirogoff was quoted in the <i>Wall















          Street Journal</i> (Oct. 2, 1992) as saying that his company
        could have transformed Hurricane Andrew "into a wimpy little
        squall". </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On November 13, 1997, the <i>Wall Street
          Journal</i> also reported "Malaysia to Battle Smog with
        Cyclones" using "new Russian technology to create cyclones... to
        cause torrential rains washing the smoke out of the air". The
        Malaysian government approved the plan in conjunction with the
        Malaysian company BioCure Snd. Bhd. and "a government-owned
        Russian party". </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The method of atmospheric ionization to
        modify weather was first patented by William Haight in 1925
        (British Patent # 251,689). He actually constructed two
        electrical rain-making towers in California. Haight claimed that
        the earth contains a positive charge of static electricity and
        the atmosphere has a negatively-charged region. Between the two
        is an insulating region of dry air that prevents the positive
        and the negative charges from combining to produce a lower
        temperature that would cause clouds to condense and rain to
        fall. By discharging high frequency alternating current into the
        insulating layer, electrical contact is established between the
        positive and negative layers. The temperature drops in the
        clouds, causing them to condnese and rain. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The technique can be adapted to produce
        clouds where none exist, or to disperse fog by forming clouds.
        The insulated apparatus was not grounded, so as to discharge
        only into the atmosphere. He used a 5 kilowatt generator to
        produce a 150-200 KHz signal (1200-2000 meters) that could
        control the weather within a radius of 5 miles. (Figures 10

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In September 2002, Russia's Emergency
        Situations Ministry announced that it had drawn rainclouds to
        Moscow and produced rain with a large ionizer. The device was
        described by Mikhail Shakhramanian, the director of the
        ministry's research institute, as "a metal cage crisscrossed by
        tungsten wire [that] emits a vertical flow of oxygen ions that
        stirs the air and raises humidity". </p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The technologies of weather modification
        with chemicals such as sodium chloride, urea, ammonium nitrate,
        iodates, etc., are well established, but they are expensive,
        unreliable, and pollute the air and water. The Dyn-O-Mat
        corporation (Riviera Beach, FL)&nbsp; manufactures "Dyn-O-Gel",
        which absorbs 2000 times it weight in water. It is marketed as
        "environmental absorbant products" under brand names such
        as&nbsp; "Dyn-O-Drought" and "Dyn-O-Storm", which are sold as as
        a weather-modifiers. The company's patent application states
        that, "The polymer is dispersed into the cloud an the wind of
        the storm agitates the mixture causing the polymer to absorb the
        rain. this reaction forms a gelatinous substance which
        precipitates to the surface below, thus diminishing the cloud's
        ability to rain". ( www.dynomat.com) </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dyn-O-Mat used a US Air Force C-130 jet to
        disperse several tons of Dyn-O-Gel into a thunderstorm on July
        16, 2001. A company spokesman claimed that Dyn-O-Gel is
        biodegradable and non-hazardous, and "burns up or dissolves when
        it hits salts water". On July 19, however, ABC News reported
        that a gelatinous "goo" was washing ashore at West Palm Beach.
        The substance was identified as Dyn-O-Gel. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The most successful method of producing rain
        by cloud-seeding was developed by Graeme Mather after 30 years
        of research. His breakthrough occurred with the observation that
        smoke from a local paper mill caused storm clouds to rain harder
        and longer. Mather's US Patent # 5,357,865 describes a method of
        hygroscopic particle seeding with a pyrotechnic flare containing
        a mixture of potassium chlorate and perchlorate. The formula
        consistently produces 40-65% more rain than unseeded storm
        clouds. His South African company Cloud Quest markets the
        technology. (www.soft.co.za/science/CloudQuest/default.htm) </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In June 2003, Thailand's King Bhumibol
        Adulyadej received a patent for his "super-sandwich" technique
        for rain-making, involving aircraft to chemically "seed" warm
        and cold clouds at different altitudes to make rain. The king's
        technique can precisely target areas where the rain is intended
        to fall. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The pseudo-secret international program to
        spread "chemtrails" is the most glaring example of desparate
        government crimes against nature and humanity. Contrails (the
        vapor trails from jets) form at low temperatures (-76° F) at
        high altitudes with 70% humidity or more. Chemtrails are toxic
        formulas containing alumina and titanium oxide and polymer
        fibers. They are spread in grid patterns at lower altitudes with
        the intent to reflect sunlight and alleviate the greenhouse
        effect, or to control weather. Often they include barium
        stearate, which serves to enhance HAARP and military radar
        transmissions. (www.chemtrail.com ~ www.carnicom.com ~

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The British Royal Air Force conducted a
        rainmaking exercise called Operation Columbus in 1952. A BBC
        report broadcast in August 2001 revealed that the project caused
        35 deaths by drowning in Devon. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1967 during the Vietnam War, the 54th
        Weather Reconnaisance Squadron engaged in Operation Popeye to
        cause flooding along Viet Cong supply lines. The operation was
        exposed by columnist Jack Anderson in 1971, and a subsequent
        Congressional investigation documented many more weather
        modification programs. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, however, It is not necessary to
        abuse the sensitive atmosphere with large-scale high
        technologies that are difficult or impossible to control. There

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The collection of atmospheric humidity is an
        ancient technology that has been rediscovered in modern times.
        In 1900, while he was engaged in clearing forests in Crimea
        (Ukraine), Russian engineer Friedrich Zibold discovered 13 large
        conical tumuli of stones, each about 10,000 feet square and
        30-40 feet tall, on hilltops , near the site of the ancient
        Byzantine city of Feodosiya. Because there were numerous remains
        of 3-inch diameter terracotta pipes about the piles, leading to
        wells and fountins in the city,&nbsp; Zibold concluded (albeit
        allegedly incorrectly, according to Beysens, <i>et al</i>.)
        that the stacks of stone were condensers that supplied Feodosiya
        with water. Zibold calculated that each "air well" produced more
        than 500 gallons daily, up to 1000 gallons under optimal
        conditions. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To verify his hypothesis, he first wrote a
        book entitled "<i>Underground Dew and New Theory on the Ground
          Origins of Spring Water</i>" (1906), and then constructed a
        stone-pile condenser at an altitude of 288 meters on Mt.
        Tepe-Oba near Feodosiya. Zibold’s condenser was surrounded by a
        1-meter wall, 20 meters wide, around a bowl-shaped collection
        area with drainage. He used sea stones (10-40 cm diameter) piled
        6 meters high in a truncated cone that was 8 meters diameter
        across the top. It began to operate in 1912 with a maximum daily
        production of 360 liters. The base developed leaks which forced
        the experiment to end in 1915. The site was partially dismantled
        and then abandoned. Beysens, <i>et al</i>., rediscovered the
        site in 1993 and cleaned it up. Zibold’s condenser has the
        distinction of actually working on a large scale, due to a
        fortuitous combination of circumstances. The shape of the stone
        pile allowed sufficient radiative cooling with only minimal
        thermal contact between the stones. Thus the ratio of
        condensation mass to surface area was sufficient to enable dew
        to condense within the pile. (Figures 16, 17) </p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Depending on the temperature and partial
        pressure (p), air contains varying amounts of water vapor. When
        the partial pressure at a given temperature exceeds a certain
        level of saturation (saturation pressure, p<sub>s</sub>), then
        condensation occurs. The term Relative Humidity (RH) is the
        ration of the partial pressure and saturation pressure: HR =
        p/ps. The saturation pressure and the carrying capacity of air
        increases with the air temperature and pressure. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When a suitable substrate is available and
        its temperature is below the dew point, dew can form and be
        collected. The substrate can be cooled to various degrees by
        radiation or conduction to the ground or atmosphere, best during
        the night. The process of cooling by radiation is of course
        inhibited during daylight hours. The process of condensation
        releases latent heat which must be dissipated. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With such principles in mind, the Belgian
        inventor Achille Knapen built an air well on a 600-foot high
        hill at Trans-en-Provence in France. The construction of his
        "Puits Aerien" took him 18 months to complete (July
        1930-December 1931). It still stands today, albeit in
        dilapidated condition. The unique structure was described in <i>Popular
















          Mechanics Magazine</i>, thus: </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The tower... is about 45 feet tall. The
        walls are from 8 to 10 feet thick to prevent the heat radiation
        from the ground from influencing the inside temperature. It is
        estimated that the aerial well will yield 7,500 gallons of water
        per 900 square feet of condensation surface."&nbsp; (Figures

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An article in <i>Popular Science Magazine</i>
        (March 1933) also featured Knapen's air well and included these
        details of its construction: </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "[The air well has] a mushroom-like inner
        core of concrete, pierced with numerous ducts for the
        circulation of air; and a central pipe with its upper opening
        above the top of the outer dome. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At night, cold air pours down the central
        pipe and circulates through the core... By morning the whole
        inner mass is so thoroughly chilled that it will maintain its
        reduced temperature for a good part of the day. The well is now
        ready to function. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Warm, moist outdoor air enters the central
        chamber, as the daytime temperature rises, through the upper
        ducts in the outer wall. It immediately strikes the chilled
        core, which is studded with rows of slates to increase the
        cooling surface. The air, chilled by the contact, gives up its
        moisture upon the slates. As it cools, it gets heavier and
        descends, finally leaving the chamber by way of the lower ducts.
        Meanwhile the moisture trickles from the slates and falls into a
        collecting basin at the bottom of the well." (Refs. 3, 4) </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The structure did not perform well, however;
        at best, it collected about 5 gallons per night. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Knapen was inspired by the work of
        bioclimatologist Leon Chaptal, director of the French
        Agricultural Physics and Bioclimatology Station at Montpellier,
        who built a small air well near Montpellier in 1929 after being
        inspired in turn by the work of Zibold. The pyramidal concrete
        structure was 3 meters square and 2.5 meter in height, with
        rings of small vent holes at the top and bottom. Its volume (8 m<sup>3</sup>)
        was filled with pieces of limestone (5-10 cm) that condensed the
        atmospheric vapor and collected it in a reservoir. The yield
        ranged from 1-2.5 liters/day from March to September. In 1930,
        the structure collected about 100 liters from April to
        September, but only half that much in 1931, when conditions were
        less favorable. The maximum yield was 5.5 lb/day. Accordingly, a
        pyramid with 2,500 cubic meters volume would furnish about 600
        liters/day. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chaptal found that the condensing surface
        must be rough, and the surface tension sufficiently low that the
        condensed water can drip. The incoming air must be moist and
        damp. The low interior temperature is established by reradiation
        at night and by the lower temperature of the soil. Air flow was
        controlled by plugging or opening the vent holes as necessary.

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The German-Australian researcher Wolf
        Klaphake tested several forms of airwells in Yugoslavia and on
        Vis Island (Croatia) in the Adriatic Sea during the 1920s and
        30s. Klaphake began to study air wells after he read the works
        of Maimonides, a Spaniard who wrote in the Arabic language about
        1,000 years ago. In his description of Palestine, Maimonides
        mentions the use of water condensers there. Klaphake summarized
        his own experiments as follows: </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A better method consisted in selecting a
        mountain slope, smoothing it with cementitious or other material
        apt to make the surface watertight, and covering it with an
        insulating material, so that the cover formed over the area a
        canopy or roof which was supported by pillars or ridges. The
        sides of the canopy were closed, whereas the upper and lower
        ends were left open by constructing holes or vents to allow the
        air to pass under the roof. This construction proved to be very
        successful, as the cooling surface of the inner part was highly
        effective. The disadvantage was that the structure was very
        expensive, and so a return was made to the block house type. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Many types of building were tried, but that
        finally adopted was a sugarloaf-shaped building, about 50 ft
        high, with walls at least 6 ft thick, with holes on the top and
        at the bottom, the inner surface being enlarged by a network of
        walls of a material with great surface. The outer wall is made
        of concrete to be able to take up a great amount of thermal
        units, the inner surface consists of sandstone or any other
        porous material. The building produces water during the day and
        cools itself during the night; when the sun rises, the warm air
        is drawn through the upper holes into the building by the
        out-flowing cooler air, becomes cooled on the cold surface,
        deposits its water, which then oozes down and is collected
        somewhere underneath. It is wrong to think that this process
        works only on days with dew, as the inner surface becomes much
        cooler than one should expect. In Dalmatia, that day was a rare
        exception which failed to produce water. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The essential principle in obtaining water
        from the air has thus been shown to be --- a great water
        condensing surface which must be well protected against the heat
        of the sun and at the same time it is necessary that the air
        should pass to the condensing surface slowly, in order that it
        may cool properly and so deposit its water. The conclusion of
        this is --- that a big heap of stones would do the same thing as
        the above-described buildings." (Ref. 6) </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oleg Bernikov received Russian Patent #
        2,190,448 for an "Independent Complex for Separating Moisture
        from Air", for use near seas. The construction contains two
        levels of pebbles separated by a water-permeable floor. Wet air
        is pumped from the surface through intake pipes into
        low-pressure cavities in the pebble beds created by sun-heated
        suction pipes. Moisture settles on the pebbles and drains into a
        reservoir. Bernikov states that "Because the floor is constantly
        wet, it reduces the temperature of the lower level of pebbles to
        and below the dew point, which results in intensive backflow of
        moisture into the water collector." (Figure 24) </p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two main forms of dew condensers have been
        developed. The first is characterized as massive (such as the
        designs by Klaphake and Zibold), which maintain a fairly
        constant temperature by producing very high specific heat.
        Modern research conducted by the non-profit International
        Organization For Dew Utilization (OPUR), however, shows that the
        best materials for the collection of atmospheric humidity should
        be light weight, thermally insulated radiative condensers that
        radiate heat quickly. Such materials were not widely available
        until recently. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nikolayev, <i>et al.</i>, have shown that
        for massive dew collectors, which "produce very high specific
        heat to maintain their temperature as constant as possible
        despite latent condensation heat levels" (2500 Joules per gram
        at 20° C), and "taking into account the different exchanges
        between the found and the atmosphere... the yield decreases
        dramatically when the mass to surface ratio increases". (Ref. 7)
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Natural radiative cooling is limited to
        between 25 and 150 W/m<sup>2</sup> at night. After compensating
        for latent condensation heat, the ideal maximum yield could not
        be over 1 liter per sq. m. One acre could produce several
        hundred gallons each night. Thus, according to D. Beysens, <i>et















          al</i>., the ideal dew collector would be a "radiative aerial
        condenser" such as developed by M. Nilsson, who has tested a
        polyethylene film containing micro-particles of titanium oxide
        that produces 100 ml/day on 1.44 sq. m. (Ref. 8-12) </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OPUR has developed a
          commercial model (CRSQ-250) that is available in a portable
          kit which includes a foldable condenser, operating manual, a
          computer program for data recording, and 30-days technical
          assistance. </font>Beysens, <i>et al.</i>, have constructed
        an experimental radiative aerial foil dew collector (10 x 3 m at
        a 30° angle) at the Vignola laboratory of the University of
        Corsica. The collector faces west to allow dew recovery during
        the early morning, at which time atmospheric temperature is
        closest to the dew point. The system collected 0.1-0.4 liters/m<sup>2</sup>.

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the 1960s, Israelis irrigated plants dew
        condensers constructed of polyethylene. A similar method was
        developed in the 1980s using specially prepared foil condensers
        to irrigate saplings. (Refs. 13, 14) </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Sahara Desert there exist many miles
        of ancient underground passages called "foggaras" that have been
        dug into the sides of mountains. The tunnels connect with the
        surface through an air vent every 75 feet or so, serving to
        collect humidity and seepage. Similar excavations exist in
        Afghanistan, and have served to hide the movement of troops from
        observation by Soviets and Americans. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1982, Calice Courneya patented an
        underground air well (USP # 4,351,651) that employs the same
        principle of using the ground as a heat sink: </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The air well is buried about 9 feet deep.
        The entrance pipe is 3-inch diameter PVC pipe (10 ft long),
        terminating just near the ground... This is an advantage because
        the greatest humidity in the atmosphere is near the
        surface."&nbsp; (Figures 26 &amp; 27)(Ref. 15) </p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a preferred embodiment, the intake is
        provided with a cyclone separator to precipitate dust before the
        air enters the pipe. In addition, a flow restrictor device can
        be installed before the exit. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Air flows through the pipes at 2,000 cubic
        feet per hour at 45<sup>o </sup>F with a 5 mph wind. This
        translates to about 48,000 ft<sup>3</sup>/day (over 3,000 lb of
        air daily). Courneya’s first air well used a turbine fan to pull
        air through the pipes. Later designs employed an electric fan
        for greater airflow. At 90<sup>o</sup>F and 80% Relative
        Humidity (RH), the air well yields about 60 lb water daily. At
        20% RH, the yield is only about 3 lb/day. The yield is even
        lower at lower temperatures.&nbsp; The water collected by the
        Courneya air well is relatively pure, equivalent to
        single-distilled water. Analysis of water collected by an air
        well near a busy street found no sulfur or lead (measured in
        ppm). The yield depends on the amount of air and its relative
        and specific humidity, and the soil temperature, thermal
        conductivity, and moisture. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Acoustic resonance within the pipes might
        enhance condensation. The more recent invention of acoustic
        refrigeration could be used to advantage, as well as the
        Hilsch-Ranque vortex tube. Oscar Blomgren's invention of
        Electrostatic Cooling (USP # 3,224,492 and # 3,872,917) also is
        recommended for its simplicity and high efficiency. Passive
        solar-heated water-ammonia intermittent absorption refrigeration
        also could augment the yield of water in a desert environment. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Courneya's design is similar to Walter
        Rogers' earlier USP # 4,234,037, issued for an "Underground
        Heating and Cooling System", which includes a water trap.

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the 1950s, the French inventor Henri
        Coanda designed an elegant method to desalinate water in Morocco
        (USP #2,803,591). He built a silo with reflective walls, mounted
        several inches over a tidal pool, angled so as to catch and
        multiply the sunlight, thus superheating the air in the chimney.
        The rising hot air drew in cold air from the bottom, and became
        super-saturated with moisture by the time it reached the top.
        Pure water flowed from the condensers there. The residual brine
        also is of great value to chemical industry and in the
        construction of solar ponds. The French government forced Coanda
        to cease operations because his device threatened their monopoly
        on salt production. (Figure 29) </p>

      </center>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Coanda also received USP # 2,761,292 for his
        "Device for Obtaining Drinkable Water" from the saturated air of
        sea coasts. He recommended that the condenser be buried so the
        earth could absorb the heat through a double radiator: </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "For example, one cubic meter of air from a
        wind whose temperature is about 40<sup>o </sup>C can contain up
        to about 50 grams of water vapor; if the wind is forced to enter
        a certain space by passing along... a radiator in which a fluid
        circulates at the temperature existing 7 or 8 meters below the
        round level, that is of about 11<sup>o </sup>C, this wind will
        immediately precipitate on the radiator walls the portion of the
        water content which is in excess of that permitted by its
        saturation point at the cooler temperature, that is, about 40
        grams per cubic meter of air, as the saturation point of air at
        11<sup>o </sup>C is 10 grams per cubic meter. The heat given
        off, which must be carried away by the fluid in the radiator,
        represents approximately 32 calories for said one cubic meter of
        air... It is advisable to pass the fluid through a second
        radiator of larger dimension disposed in the ground at a certain
        depth. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If the humidity of the warm air is
        definitely below 50 grams of water per cubic meter, that is, if
        the air is far from its saturation limit, and if the device for
        obtaining fresh water is disposed near the sea, it is possible
        to use [windmills] for spraying sea water into the warm air in
        fine droplets, thereby increasing the amount of water contained
        in the warm air through the partial evaporation of the sea water
        thereinto." (Figures 30 &amp; 31) </p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seawater also can be used as a coolant;
        deep-sea water (at 4.5° C from 500 meters) can be pumped to cool
        a heat exchanger which is humidified with seawater and exposed
        to air currents. Such a system is installed at the Ukraine
        Maritime Hydrophysics Institute. It requires, however, several
        KW/m<sup>2</sup>/day to operate. Wave-power pumps could be
        implemented to eliminate the associated fuel costs. (Refs. 16,
        17) </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are several patents extant for
        glorified air conditioners that dehumidify the air to produce
        potable water, but they all require electrical power. Soviet
        cosmonauts aboard space station Mir used a system that recovered
        water from the air. The Aqua-Cycle, invented by William Madison,
        has been marketed since 1992. It resembles a drinking fountain
        and functions as such, but it is not connected to any plumbing.
        It contains a refrigerated dehumidifier and a
        triple-purification system (carbon, deionization, and UV light)
        that produces water as pure as triple-distilled. Under optimal
        operating conditions (80<sup>o</sup>/60% humidity) the unit can
        produce up to 5 gallons daily (US Patents # 6,644,060 ~&nbsp; #
        6,490,879). The devices are sold by Vapair Technologies, Inc

          name="dewponds"></a> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The water collectors known as "dew ponds"
        were invented in prehistoric times, but the technology is nearly
        forgotten today. A few functional dew ponds can still be found
        on the highest ridges of England's bleak Sussex Downs and on the
        Marlborough and Wiltshire Hills, and connected to castle walls.
        They always contain some water that apparently condenses from
        the air during the night. Gilbert White described a dew pond at
        Selbourne (south of London), only 3 feet deep and 30 feet in
        diameter, that contained some 15,000 gallons of water which
        supplied 300 sheep and cattle every day without fail. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Investigations by UNEP (1982) and by Pacey
        and Cullis (1986) determined that the ponds do not catch
        significant amounts of dew, but actually were filled mainly by
        rainfall. Pacey and Cullis may, however, have confused dew
        precipitation with rainfall --- two different processes. The
        ponds may also collect fog. (Ref 18) </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Edward A. Martin proved that dew ponds are
        not filled by precipitated dew because the water usually is
        warmer than the air, so no dew could be deposited. He concluded
        that mist condenses on the water already in the pond, or else
        the grass collects dew which gravitates to the bottom and forms
        a pond. Both mechanisms probably are active. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ancient question, "Does dew rises from
        the soil by evaporation or precipitates by condensation from the
        air?" first was posed by Aristotle. John Aitken proved in 1885
        that dew rises or falls as conditions allow. He also determined
        the favorable conditions for the formation of dew: (1) a
        radiating surface, (2) still air, and (3) moist, warm earth. The
        ability of materials to capture dew depends on their specific
        heats. The best material is swan's down, followed by flax or
        cotton, silk, paper, straw, wool, earth, charcoal, silica sand,
        and powdered chalk. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arthur J. Hubbard described a dew pond in
        his book<i> Neolithic Dew-Ponds and Cattleways</i> (1907): </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is [in England] at least one
        wandering gang of men... who will construct for the modern
        farmer a pond which, in any suitable situation in a sufficiently
        dry soil, will always contains water. The water is not derived
        from springs or rainfall, and is speedily lost if even the
        smallest rivulet is allowed to flow into the pond. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The gang of dew-pond makers commence
        operations by hollowing out the earth for a space far in excess
        of the apparent requirements of the proposed pond. They then
        thickly cover the whole of the hollow with a coating of dry
        straw. The straw in turn is covered by a layer of well-chosen,
        finely puddled clay, and the upper surface of the clay is then
        closely strewn with stones. Care has to be taken that the margin
        of the straw is effectively protected by clay. The pond will
        eventually become filled with water, the more rapidly the larger
        it is, even though no rain may fall. If such a structure is
        situated on the summit of a down, during the warmth of a summer
        day the earth will have stored a considerable amount of heat,
        while the pond, protected from this heat by the non-conductivity
        of the straw, is at the same time chilled by the process of
        evaporation from the puddled clay. The consequence is that
        during the night the warm air is condensed on the surface of the
        cold clay. As the condensation during the night is in excess of
        the evaporation during the day, the pond becomes, night by
        night, gradually filled. Theoretically, we may observe that
        during the day, the air being comparatively charged with
        moisture, evaporation is necessarily less than the precipitation
        during the night. In practice it is found that the pond will
        constantly yield a supply of the purest water. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The dew pond will cease to attract the dew
        if the layer of straw should get wet, as it then becomes of the
        same temperature as the surrounding earth, and ceases to be a
        non-conductor of heat. This practically always occurs if a
        spring is allowed to flow into the pond, or if the layer of clay
        (technically called the 'crust') is pierced." </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Additional construction details were
        explained in <i>Scientific American</i> (May 1934): </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "An essential feature of the dew-pond is its
        impervious bottom, enabling it to retain all the water it
        gathers, except what is lost by evaporation, drunk by cattle, or
        withdrawn by man. The mode of construction varies in some
        details. The bottom commonly consists of a layer of puddled
        chalk or clay, over which is strewn a layer of rubble to prevent
        perforation by the hoofs of animals. A layer of straw is often
        added, above or below the chalk or clay. The ponds may measure

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Edward A. Martin also described their
      construction in his book <i>Dew Ponds</i> (London, 1917). In
      particular, he notes that in order to ram the clay and puddle the
      surface, horses are driven round and through the pond for several
      hours. The base of the pond is planted with grass; without grass,
      the pond dries up. Trees and brush are planted around the pond to
      provide shade.
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The simplest form of dew pond is used in
        Cornwall, where areas of about 40 square feet are prepared on
        mountain slopes by coating the ground with clay and surrounding
        it with a small wall. The clay is covered with a thick layer of
        straw that collects dew during the night. Straw is said to be
        more effective than grass for the purpose. Since the straw is
        moist both day and night, it rots quickly and must be replaced
        frequently.(Ref. 20) </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his book, <i>The Naturalist on the
          Thames</i>, published circa 1900, C. J. Cornish gave a
        description of British dew ponds, excerpted here: </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “The dew ponds, so called because they are
        believed to be fed by dew and vapours, and not by rain, have
        kept their water, while the deeper ponds in the valleys have
        often failed. The shepherds on the downs are careful observers
        of these ponds, because if they run dry they have to take their
        sheep to a distance or draw water for them from very deep wells.
        They maintain that there are on the downs some dew ponds which
        have never been known to run dry. Others which do run dry do so
        because the bottom is injured by driving sheep into them and so
        perforating the bed when the water is shallow, and not from the
        failure of the invisible means of supply. There seem to be two
        sources whence these ponds draw water, the dew and the fogs... </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “The fogs will draw up the hollows towards
        the ponds, and hang densely round them. Fog and dew may or may
        not come together; but generally there is a heavy dew deposit on
        the grass when a fog lies on the hills. After such fogs, though
        rain may not have fallen for a month, and there is no water
        channel or spring near the dew pond, the water in it rises
        prodigiously... </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “The shepherds say that it is always well to
        have one or two trees hanging over the pond, for that these
        distil the water from the fog. This is certainly the case. The
        drops may be heard raining on to the surface in heavy mists.” </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cornish quoted Gilbert White’s <i>Journal</i>
        of May, 1775:“’[I]t appears that the small and even the
        considerable ponds in the vales are now dried up, but the small
        ponds on the very tops of the hills are but little affected’.
        Can this difference be accounted for by evaporation alone, which
        is certainly more prevalent in the bottoms? Or, rather, have not
        these elevated pools some unnoticed recruits, which in the night
        time counterbalance the waste of the day? " These unnoticed
        recruits, though it is now certain that they come in the form of
        those swimming vapours from which little moisture seems to fall,
        are enlisted by means still not certainly known. The common
        explanation was that the cool surface of the water condensed the
        dew, just as the surface of a glass of iced water condenses
        moisture. The ponds are always made artificially in the first
        instance, and puddled with clay and chalk. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Mr. Clement Reid… notes his own experiences
        of the best sites for dew ponds. They should, he thinks, be
        sheltered on the south-west by an overhanging tree. In those he
        is acquainted with the tree is often only a stunted, ivy-covered
        thorn or oak, or a bush of holly, or else the southern bank is
        high enough to give shadow. ‘When one of these ponds is examined
        in the middle of a hot summer's day’, he adds, ‘it would appear
        that the few inches of water in it could only last a week. But
        in early morning, or towards evening, or whenever a sea-mist
        drifts in, there is a continuous drip from the smooth leaves of
        the overhanging tree. There appears also to be a considerable
        amount of condensation on the surface of the water itself,
        though the roads may be quite dry and dusty. In fact, whenever
        there is dew on the grass the pond is receiving moisture’. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Though this is evidently the case, no one
        has explained how it comes about that the pond surface receives
        so very much more moisture than the grass. The heaviest dew or
        fog would not deposit an inch, or even two inches, of water over
        an area of grass equal to that of the pond. None of the current
        theories of dew deposits quite explain this very interesting
        question. Two lines of inquiry seem to be suggested, which might
        be pursued side by side. These are the quantities distilled or
        condensed on the ponds, and the means by which it is done; and
        secondly, the kind of tree which, in Gilbert White's phrase,
        forms the best "alembic" for distilling water from fog at all
        times of the year. It seems certain that the tree is an
        important piece of machinery in aid of such ponds, though many
        remain well supplied without one.” </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An improved form of traditional dew pond was
        invneteded by A.J. Hubbard, <i>et al</i>., and granted British
        Patent # 13,039 (1 March 1905), "Improvements in Reservoirs for
        Collecting Dew". The complete specification is as follows: </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "For the purpose of securing water supply in
        the absence of rainfall, springs, or streams, reservoirs adapted
        to collect dew have been constructed by excavating the ground
        over an area and to a depth sufficient to form a basin of
        adequate capacity and providing the same with a compound lining
        comprising a bed of straw as a non-conductor and a superimposed
        water-tight layer of clay. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The action of such a reservoir depends on
        the fact that the non-conducting layer of straw prevents the
        tendency to the equalization of temperature of the clay layer
        and water to that of the earth. The water, cooled by radiation,
        consequently retains the coldness so caused, and the temperature
        of the air in contact with it is reduced below the dew point.
        Consequently the water vapour in the air condenses and collects
        in the reservoir. Such reservoirs as heretofore constructed,
        however, have been comparatively inefficient, and, unless on
        chalk, liable to destruction by moisture, worms, or other
        causes, disadvantages which it is an object of this invention to
        obviate, for which purpose, according thereto the basin is
        provided with a lining possessing both impermeable and
        non-conducting properties. In practice this can be
        advantageously effected by the use of a compound lining
        comprising two layers of impermeable material with interposed
        material that is non-conducting or is a bad conductor of heat.
        In order that the non-conducting property of the lining be not
        impaired it is necessary that the lining should be so formed
        that the non-conducting material cannot become wet. For this
        reason when absorbent non-conducting material is interposed
        between two layers of impermeable material, the two layers of
        impermeable material are continuously joined a the edges in a
        watertight manner. For the purpose of increasing the evaporation
        and consequently reducing the temperature of the surface upon
        which the water vapour is to be condensed, a water-retaining
        cover is preferably superimposed upon the upper layer of
        impermeable material. Where necessary owing to the character of
        the soil, a solid foundation is formed in the basin upon which
        the lower layer of impermeable material is laid. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The drawing shows, diagrammatically, in
        vertical section, by way of example, a reservoir for dew
        according to this invention, in which <i>a</i> is a concrete
        foundation, <i>b</i> a layer of asphalt, <i>c</i> a layer of
        asbestos, <i>d</i> a second layer of asphalt having its edge
        joined to that of the lower layer <i>b</i> as at <i>e</i> so
        as to completely enclose the asbestos <i>c</i>, and thus
        prevent it becoming wet and its non-conducting property becoming
        impaired; <i>f</i> is a layer of bricks of a porous nature
        which are rapidly cooled to a low temperature owing to the
        evaporation of the water absorbed by them; <i>g</i> is a stone
        curb which serves to prevent the edges of the lining being
        damaged. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In some cases the concrete foundation a may
        be dispensed with, as also the porous bricks <i>f</i>." </p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another form of dew pond was invented by
        S.B. Russell in the 1920s. According to the description in <i>Popular
















          Science</i> (September 1922), "A dew reservoir 30 feet square
        will collect 24,000 gallons of water in a year, or an average of
        120 gallons daily during the hot summer months and 50 gallons
        daily for the remainder of the year... </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Russell reservoir consists of a
        concrete cistern about 5 feet deep, with sloping concrete roof,
        above which is a protective fence of corrugated iron which aids
        in collecting and condensing vapor on the roof and prevents
        evaporation by the wind. The floor of the cistern is flush with
        the ground, while sloping banks of earth around the sides lead
        up to the roof. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Moisture draining into the reservoir from
        the low side of the roof maintains the roof at a lower
        temperature than the atmosphere, thus assuring continuous
        condensation. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At one side of the reservoir is a concrete
        basin set in the ground. By means of a ball valve, this basin is
        automatically kept full of water drawn from the reservoir."

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Roman author Pliny the Elder mentioned
        the Holy Fountain Tree, growing on the island of El Hierro in
        the Canary Islands. For thousands of years (until about 100
        years ago), the people there obtained most of their water from
        the trees, the leaves of which captured fog. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1945, South Africa's chief meteorologist,
        Theodore Schumann, proposed the construction of a unique
        cloud-condenser on top of Table Mountain on the south side of
        Capetown. Schumann designed two large parallel wire screens, one
        insulated and one grounded, charged with a potential difference
        of 50-100 KV. The wire screens were to be about 150-ft. high,
        9,000 ft. long, and 1 foot apart. He estimated that the
        electrified fence would condense as much as 30,000,000 gallons
        daily from "The Cloth", a perpetual cloud that crowns the 3,000
        ft peak. The fence was never built. (Figure 42) </p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alvin Marks invented the "Power Fence" (USP
        # 4,206,396) to generate electricity from the wind by means of a
        charged aerosol which was dispersed from microscopic holes in
        the tubing of the fence. Marks calculated that if the wind
        averaged 25 mph, a mile of fence would generate about 40
        megawatts. The towers would be 500 feet high, strung with a grid
        of steel bars in a rectangular array, subdivided into a lattice
        of 4-inch squares. The squares are divided by a mesh of
        perforated tubules through which the water flows. Marks’ patent
        also claims that the system can be used to modify weather and to
        clear fog in the same manner that Schumann proposed.. (Figure 43

        Meredith Gourdine (USP # 4,671,807) has been used at Los Angeles
        and Ontario International Airports and by the Air Force since
        1986. The system sprays an electrified mist into the fog over
        the runways, thus clearing them for landing. A similar system
        was invented by Hendricus Loos (USP 4,475,927). (Figure 45) (Ref

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alekseevich, <i>et al</i>., used high
        voltage direct current to perform mist-clearing; thus, "electric
        force lines are directed upward in the air... producing charged
        particles based on corona discharge... The charged particles
        absorb water in the air, condensing and binding into water, and
        dispersing the fog", according to USP # 6,152,378. </p>

        Pilie and Eugene Mack (USP # 3,889,532) "consists of a slotted
        seainless steel rotatable tube. The tube is rotated and fog
        droplets are collected by impaction on the tube. Centrifugal

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the late 1980s there has been
        considerable research and development of fog collectors around
        the world, pioneered by Dr Robert Schemenauer and Prof. Pilar
        Cereceda (Univ. of Chile). The Canadian organization FogQuest (
        www.fogquest.org ) is the international leader in this admirable
        effort; Dr Schemenauer now serves as a research scientist with
        the organization. (Refs. 24-26) </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fog contains from 0.05 gram of water per
        cubic meter, up to 3 grams. The droplets are 1 to 40 microns in
        diameter. Fog has a very low settling rate, and it is carried by
        the wind wherever it may go. Fog collectors therefore require a
        vertical screen surface positioned at right angles to the
        prevailing wind. The collector must be a mesh because wind will
        flow around a solid wall and take the fog with it. A fog
        collector captures about half of the water passing through it.
        The efficiency of fog collectors depends on the size of fog
        droplets, wind speed, and the size of mesh (about 1 mm is
        optimal), which should fill up to 70% of the area. Two layers of
        ultraviolet-protected mesh, erected so as to rub together, cause
        the minute droplets to join and drain into PVC pipes attached to
        the bottom of the nets. The lifetime of the mesh is about 10
        years. It costs about 25 cents or more per square meter. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ideal location for fog collecters are
        arid or semi-arid coastal regions with cold offshore currents
        and a mountain range within 15 miles of the coast, rising 1,500
        to 3,000 feet above sea level. Collection varies with the
        topography and the density of the fog. Ocean or lowland fog
        usually lacks sufficient water or wind speed to yield a
        substantial amount of water, so careful evaluation studies must
        be made to determine the suitability of any particular
        microclimate. This is done by monitoring a number of 1 m<sup>2</sup>
        collectors for a period of months. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fog fences have the advantages of being
        passive, requiring no artificial energy input for operation.
        They&nbsp; are simple to design and can be constructed quickly
        and easily with little skill. The system is modular, easy to
        maintain, and can be expanded as demand increases or money
        allows. Investment costs are low --- much less than conventional
        sources in the areas where this technology can be applied. The
        water quality usually is good, though some treatment may be
        necessary for human consumption. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mesh fog collectors are limited by the local
        conditions of climate and topography. The yield is affected by
        season and weather, included macro-systems such as El Nino and
        La Nina. Dust can cause high levels of metals and low pH. High
        humidity can promote the growth of microflora, and other sources
        of contamination (i.e., insects and birds) must be considered.
        Unless the collectors are close to the consumers, the system
        requires uneconomical pipelines that also present hydraulic
        problems. The site must be easily accessable and have clear
        ownership. Site security also may be an issue. Management of the
        water distribution must be fair, efficient, and self-sufficient.
        (Ref 27) </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A very successful pilot project was
        established at Chungungo, Chile in 1987. Over a period of 5
        years, 94 fog collectors were constructed atop 2,600 ft. El Tofo
        Mountain, collecting up to 2,000 gallons daily (mean yield: 3
        liters/m<sup>2</sup>/day).&nbsp; The villagers call it
        "harvesting the clouds". Walter Canto, regional director of
        Chile's National Forest Corporation, said: </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We're not only giving Chungongo all the
        water it needs, but we have enough water to start forests around
        the area that within 5 or 6 years will be totally
        self-sustaining." (Figure 49) </p>

      </center>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fog collectors on El Tofo have fallen
        into a sad state of disrepair. In 2002, only 9 collectors
        remained of the 94 that once shrouded the mountaintop. (Figure
        50) </p>

      </center>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The success of the fog collectors at
        Chungongo actually contributed to the failure of the project.
        The new supply of water stimulated local development that
        tripled the population to 900 inhabitants while reducing the
        amount of water available to each family. It would have been a
        simple matter to increase the number of fog collectors, but a
        political decision was made to construct a pipeline (costing ~
        US$1M) to bring water from Los Choros. Dr Schemenauer, who
        directed the original project, said that 400 collectors (many
        more than enough to meet the need) could be built on the
        mountain at a much lower cost than that of the pipeline. But the
        villagers were not significantly involved in the original
        project, so they had little understanding of water economics and
        what was required to maintain the collectors over a period of
        years; they were taken for granted. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The International Development Research
        Center (IDRC) that sponsored the original project reported that
        local officials "regard water from fog as an unreliable,
        irregular, and insufficient source for providing drinking water
        for Chungongo". </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Schemenauer maintains that the original
        project was not designed to supply water to the community. It
        was intended to perfect the technology and use the&nbsp; water
        for a reforestation project on the mountain. The local community
        lobbied to divert water to the village instead, and it was done.
        The obvious lesson is that the local people must be involved and
        committed to long-term maintainance and development, adding more
        fog collectors if the need arises. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another 21 sites (1,000 acres total) in
        Chile and on the Pacific coast of Latin America also have fog
        collectors that continue to provide water for agricultural and
        forestry projects. Some of the locations have become
        self-sufficient because the trees have become large enough to
        collect fog for themselves, just as the ecosystem did before
        settlers disrupted it. Precarious "lomas" fog-forest ecosystems
        survive on droplets of water collected by their leaves. Some
        such forests, surrounded by deserts, have been sustained by fog
        for millenia. Very little cutting is necessary to initiate
        gradual but complete destruction. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the past few years, FogQuest has
        conducted several successful projects in Yemen, Guatemala (Lake
        Atitlan), and Haiti (Salignac Plateau). More are being planned
        in the Sultinate of Oman, Ethiopia, and Nepal. The Yemen project
        is in the mountains near Hajja, where there is virtually no
        rainfall in the winter months. There is, however, sufficient fog
        to justify the construction of large fog collectors. The best
        sites produce about 4.5 liters/m<sup>2</sup>/day.&nbsp; The
        yield at the best sites in Haiti is about 5.5 liters/m<sup>2</sup>day.















        In other words, each square meter of mesh produces about 165
        liters/month. A large collector (50 m<sup>2</sup>) would produce
        about 175 liters daily, which is sufficient to supply the needs
        of nine people.. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fog collectors in the Sultanate of Oman have
        yielded as much as 70 liters/sq meter/day! A 48 m<sup>2</sup>
        collector there yields over 3000 liters/day. Each village
        requires 30 to 80 collectors (cost: ~ US$400 each) to provide
        its needs. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The many forms of atmospheric dehumidifiers
        offer real hope for thirsty humanity. Countless lives can be
        saved and improved by this elegant technology. The quantity of
        water thus produced may even meet the needs of large-scale
        agriculture if used in a conservative manner, such as
        drip-feeding. </p>
