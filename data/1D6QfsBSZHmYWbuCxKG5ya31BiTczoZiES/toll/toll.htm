      <span style="font-style: italic;">Inventive: Ian Toll, with the
        Autoclave machine that divides household waste automatically --
      </span><br>
      <br>
      The days of having to sort out household rubbish before collection
      could be over after scientists created a machine to do it
      automatically. <br>
      <br>
      Scientists have created the Autoclave system, which divides the
      waste for recycling on a huge scale and produces enough energy to
      power itself. <br>
      <br>
      Its inventors, AeroThermal, say that at some point in the future,
      householders could even sell their rubbish because there is
      potentially a profit in it. <br>
      <br>
      All steel and aluminium is cleaned during the process, plastics
      are reduced to recyclable pellets and glass is made reusable. <br>
      <br>
      Food and organic refuse is turned into a biogas that can be
      converted into green electricity. Even the steam that is used in
      the process is recaptured afterwards and re-used so nothing is
      released into the atmosphere.<br>
      <br>
      In two hours the technology, which acts like a giant steam-powered
      pressure cooker, can deal with 30 tonnes of municipal waste. <br>
      <br>
      AeroThermal said the Autoclave system could be used to achieve the
      EU and government targets for dealing with our household waste. <br>
      <br>
      Ian Toll, managing director of the firm based in Poole, Dorset,
      said: "The system provides real answers to environmental problems.
      <br>
      <br>
      "Disposal of rubbish poses headaches for authorities on a local
      and national scale, and we believe this system will reduce
      pollution - and the cost of waste management. <br>
      <br>
      "It is proof that engineering and the application of science can
      go some way to help combat the major threats facing us today. <br>
      <br>
      He added: "Its effect will be felt by ordinary people because it
      means we could revert back to the old system of putting out
      rubbish - with everything in the same bag. <br>
      <br>
      "It powers itself and there is enough green electricity left over
      to put back into the national grid - and it could ensure we reach
      recycling targets. <br>
      <br>
      "The steel and aluminium is cleaned and all the labels are
      removed, and that increases its value. <br>
      <br>
      "The plastics, including plastic bags, are separated and reduced
      so they can be recycled. <br>
      <br>
      "And all the food and cellulose material is reduced to its basic
      form, and after it is put through an anaerobic digestion system it
      can be converted into electricity. <br>
      <br>
      "There is no need for us to ship any of our waste to China when we
      have the technology to sort it out then recycle it."<br

      </div>
      <br>
      AeroThermal’s autoclave is a pressure vessel that steam treats its
      contents at a constant temperature and pressure, serving to
      sterilise, clean, break-down lignin structures and reduce waste
      volume by approximately 60%. <br>
      <br>
      Then, by applying a secondary process the true added value of the
      autoclave can be realised. These qualities can not only serve to
      increase landfill diversion rates, but if the process by-product,
      cellulose floc, is used to its full advantage, clean, green energy
      can be derived from waste. <br>
      <br>
      Exhaustive trials and in-house analysis show the autoclave process
      modifies the cell structure of the waste and renders the material
      suitable for a number of other processes. For example, by
      employing Anaerobic Digestion (AD), an easily accessible biogas is
      created, which can then be directly used to feed gas powered
      generators, that will not only supply sufficient power to operate
      the entire processing facility but also provide a surplus to sell
      back to the national grid . As part of the AD process, the
      resultant substrate can be further treated to derive even higher
      levels of energy generation. A subsidiary company within the
      AeroThermal Group, EnviroThermal, has recently agreed worldwide
      technical and commercial development rights to market an
      innovative fixed bed, multidirectional airflow, gasification unit,
      a further example of the engineering expertise and range of
      complementary products the group brings to the industry in which
      they operate. AeroThermal’s engineering competencies, business
      acumen and wide ranging experience ensures the Company is well
      positioned to deliver bespoke turnkey, process engineering
      solutions that can be tailored to suit individual customer’s
      requirements, designed and implemented to world class standards.
      All large scale manufacturing in Europe is handled by
      AeroThermal’s European partner, specialists in large-scale
      fabrications that require high standards of tolerance and finish.
      The company is ISO9001 certified and manufactures in accordance
      with the requirement of such classification societies as Lloyds
      Register, TV and DNV. Their team of well-motivated and highly
      skilled people uses modern machinery in a spaciously laid out
      production facility with a maximum hoist-capacity of 250 tonnes.
      The company is situated on the banks of a major river in mainland
      Europe, so AeroThermal’s equipment can be easily shipped anywhere
      in the world. Plant destined for the US market is manufactured by
      AeroThermal’s associate company, Thermal Equipment Corporation
      based in Torrance, California. It has over forty years of design
      and fabrication experience ensuring that our Group is able to
      maintain worldwide service and customer support. <br>

        Handling System </span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      * All materials exiting the autoclave are initially sized through
      a course screen grid to remove oversize objects above 180 mm. <br>
      * The balance of the material is automatically conveyed to the
      first Starscreen separator which removes materials sized between 0
      – 12 mm, this is followed by an – <br>
      * Air separator to remove light materials and a – <br>
      * Second line rotating drum magnet to remove any ferrous content.
      (Please note: optional water bath separation is also available at
      this stage, should a particularly high level of separation be
      required). <br>
      * The balance of the material stream is passed to a second
      Starscreen sizing items between 12-50mm, which is again fitted
      with an additional air separator. <br>
      * The material is then passed through two further magnetic fields
      via a drum magnet and an overhead band magnet. * The waste stream
      is also subjected to eddy current separation for the removal of
      any aluminium materials. <br>
      * Optional additional separation is also available for the removal
      of brass and copper, plus infrared detection for the removal of
      specifically selected plastics. The benefits of separation at this
      point include: <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Financial </span><br>
      <br>
      * This innovative sorting system eliminates the requirement to
      source segregate Municipal Solid Waste thus reducing collection,
      transport and contractual costs. <br>
      * Removes the need for costly hand picking lines for recyclables.
      <br>
      * Produces an organic fraction ready for secondary processing and
      sterilised, clean recyclables that command a higher market price.
      <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Recyclates </span><br>
      <br>
      * Post process the vast majority of plastics are reduced in volume
      and rolled up into easily removable balls. Metal cans have their
      labelling and any residual food contents removed and aluminium and
      glass are sorted, cleaned and sterilised. <br>
      * The autoclave process does not destroy any material with a
      potential recyclable value. It simply changes their form to
      facilitate separate collection thus allowing recycling of the
      cellulose floc for cardboard or re-use as a feed stock for AD or
      thermal processing. Time With an individual vessel process time of
      144 minutes per cycle, a pair of autoclaves can deliver 20
      operational cycles per 24 hours. When combined with an efficient
      organic digestion facility, this ensures the system has the
      ability to be energy self sustainable, permitting a fast low cost
      and highly efficient method for the processing of municipal solid
      waste.<br>

      There are three key size plants. <br>
      <br>
      • 30,000 T p.a. (suitable for food waste) <br>
      • 90,000 / 100,000 T p.a. (suitable for MSW at local authority
      level) <br>
      • 150,000 / 200,000 T p.a. (suitable for large scale MSW
      processing facilities) <br>
      <br>
      With a single autoclave system, comprising two machines, the
      installation becomes modular, so that 1, 2 or 3 systems could be
      operated in tandem depending upon the specific annual tonnage
      requirements of individual councils, unitary authorities or
      commercial enterprises <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Key Operational Features and
        Benefits of Autoclaving Waste </span><br style="font-weight:
        bold;">
      <br>
      •2 autoclaves operating in parallel, capable of handling 15 tonnes
      MSW per load each (for this example only) means that with 24 hour
      operation the plant can handle up to 300 tonnes per day assuming
      the mass density to be 225 kg/m3 . <br>
      • As steam is recycled between the 2 autoclaves it significantly
      reduces the amount of energy the system requires. •The steam can
      be generated from waste heat from the electricity generation
      plant, powered by the production of methane gas. <br>
      • There is minimal operational noise, offensive odours are reduced
      and harmful toxins are not released into the atmosphere.
      •Autoclaved waste has on average a 60% reduction in volume and
      with the liquid fraction separated at this point, the mass can be
      greatly reduced. <br>
      • For a plant managing 100,000 tonnes per annum the site
      requirement is a minimal three acres. Land take should be
      considered to be on a “sliding scale”, meaning that a 30,000 t.p.a
      plant will only require one acre. <br>
      • As the process can handle totally unsorted, black bag municipal
      solid waste at the same time as high organic fraction supermarket
      waste and kitchen food waste, it is possible to combine
      industrial, commercial and residential waste management
      strategies. <br>
      • The system will process the waste at conditions that satisfy the
      Clinical Waste Regulations and both Category Two and Three of the
      Animal By-products Regulations. Category One is also obtainable,
      should the in-feed be pre-shredded, subject to site approval. <br>
      • All recyclable materials will begathered and sorted after the
      process and will be sterile and clean, therefore commanding a
      better price within the open market. Post Process Options <br>
      • Post process options are one of the key benefits of autoclaving.
      The output can be dried, and subject to the amount of organic
      fraction present, the liquid used to produce sufficient biogas to
      meet the energy requirements of the plant. The dried cellulose
      floc can then be sent for recycling within the paper and cardboard
      industry or it can be turned into a solid biomass fuel for thermal
      treatment feed stock and used to produce further green
      electricity. <br>
      • As autoclaving produces a hydrolysed, homogenised waste stream
      it is perfect for use in anaerobic digestion systems. <br>
      • It will increase the potential gas volume by as much as 100%
      with a far faster rate of production. <br>
      • Peak gas flow can be attained in as little as a quarter of the
      time of a standard AD system. Key Financial Features and Benefits
      of our system are: <br>
      • DEFRA estimates that electricity output per tonne of waste is
      between 75 – 225 kw-hr, dependant on the quality of the waste
      stream received (the higher the organic fraction, the higher the
      energy). With autoclaving the benefits are such that the system
      will operate closer to the top of this range at about 200 kw-hr
      per tonne. <br>
      • With a feed rate of 12.5 tonne/hr we will generate 2.5Mw. <br>
      • With the allowances for green electricity, this is worth up to
      15p/kw-hr or £24 per tonne of waste. <br>
      • The plant is totally self sufficient in its own energy needs. <br>
      • In 2009 England will see the introduction of the Landfill
      Allowance Trading Scheme (LATS) charged at £150 per tonne over and
      above the current cost of disposal. Thus potential revenues for
      those with a robust waste strategy in place can only be
      beneficial. <br>
      • With an annual capacity of approximately 100,000 tonnes, this
      plant is well suited to service the needs of 200,000 people,
      negating the requirement for any long distance transport or waste
      movement across local authority boundaries.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract </span>-- An autoclave
      is provided for heat treatment of a load whose position relative
      to the autoclave, whose cross-section and/or whose thermal
      characteristics may vary along the load, e.g. large panels for an
      airliner. The autoclave comprises a chamber for receiving the
      load, a wall of said chamber providing one end thereof and a door
      providing the other end of the chamber and giving access for
      insertion and removal of the load. Means is provided for heating
      gas in the chamber, and a plurality of gas circulation means are
      provided spaced along the length of the autoclave and each
      producing a zone for circulation of heating gas. Means is provided
      for independent control of the rate of heat transfer between the
      heating gas and the load in said zones and said gas circulation
      means is arranged to produce a pattern of circulation in which
      heating gas impinges non-axially onto the load. <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </span><br>
      <br>
      [0001] The present invention relates to autoclaves and to their
      use in the heat treatment of workpieces. <br>
      <br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION</span>
      <br>
      <br>
      [0002] EP-B-0176508 discloses a design for a gas-fired autoclave
      which is useful e.g. in the production of articles from
      fiber/resin mixtures and heat treatment of workpieces in the
      glass, automotive and aerospace industries and which nowadays
      typically have working temperatures of up to 450.degree. C. and
      working pressures of up to 68 Bar. Autoclaves for use in curing
      composites or heat-treating glass articles might typically have a
      length of 3-4 meters, a diameter of 1-3 meters and a volume of
      10-20 m.sup.3. For use in the automotive industry e.g. for heat
      treating the chassis of a racing car an autoclave may typically
      have a diameter of about 2.75 meters with a length of about 4.5
      meters and an internal volume of about 25 m.sup.3. For use in the
      heat treatment of aerospace components, an autoclave might
      typically have a diameter of about 4.25 meters, a diameter of
      about 12 meters and a volume of about 170 m.sup.3. <br>
      <br>
      [0003] As shown in FIG. 1, a typical prior art autoclave is based
      on a pressure vessel that has a length of about 3.7 meters (12
      feet) and a diameter of about 1.5 meters (5 feet), the vessel
      having a body 10 and a loading door 12. Vacuum lines 14 are
      provided for connection to the mold side of a mold tool (not
      shown) that is covered by a flexible diaphragm with a workpiece to
      be molded located between the tool and the diaphragm. The tool is
      connectable through valve 18 to vacuum and through valve 20 to
      air. Valve 22 can be operated to admit air through pressure lines
      16 to the interior of the pressure vessel. Heating is by exposed
      radiant tubes 24 that run up and down the length of the pressure
      vessel. The entry to each tube is provided with a gas-fired heater
      34 and the discharge end of each tube is provided with an impeller
      36 by which a negative pressure is produced towards the discharge
      end and a flow of flue gas is maintained through the tube. A motor
      38 mounted on the tank end wall drives a radial flow impeller 40
      to produce a re-circulating flow of the gas within the pressure
      vessel. Thermocouples 42 through the tank wall 10 responsive to
      gas temperature are connected to a control unit 44 that is
      operatively connected to the various heaters to turn them off or
      on and maintain the gaseous atmosphere within the autoclave at
      .+-.1.degree. of an intended value. The use of a variable speed
      impeller to enable the same tubes to be used for heating and for
      return to room temperature during the cooling part of the
      operating cycle is disclosed in EP-A-0333389. Autoclaves of other
      designs may be electrically heated, steam heated, oil-heated, hot
      air heated or gas radiant-heated, but up to now they have relied
      on an impeller in the end wall to produce a single generally axial
      pattern of re-circulating gas flow as indicated by the arrows in
      FIG. 1. <br>
      <br>
      [0004] U.S. Pat. No. 6,240,333 (Lockheed-Martin) concerns the
      fabrication of composite parts in an autoclave. Lockheed-Martin
      explain that the F22 Raptor is an example of an aircraft made
      largely from composite materials formed with flexible graphite
      fibres, called a ply, that are impregnated with epoxy or BMI
      resins which harden when subjected to the application of heat. The
      uncured plies are placed on tools, each tool corresponding to a
      composite part of the Raptor. Thus, when the graphite resin
      mixture hardens over the tool, the composite part is formed with
      the proper shape. Lockheed-Martin go on to explain that a number
      of production techniques are available for forming composite
      parts. Again, using the Raptor as an example, once the plies are
      placed over the tool, a vacuum bag is used to hold the plies
      securely to the tool during curing of the resin. The vacuum bag
      forces the material to the tool and prevents the formation of
      bubbles and other material deformities. The tools are then placed
      in an autoclave for heating according to a schedule, adherence to
      which may be essential in order to avoid the production of
      defective parts. <br>
      <br>
      [0005] Lockheed-Martin further explain that an autoclave operator
      must carefully distribute tools in the heating chamber of the
      autoclave to ensure that heating rate specifications are met, a
      typical autoclave being 15 metres (50 feet) long but nevertheless
      still being heated by blowing air with a large fan located at one
      end of the heating chamber. They identify a number of difficulties
      that this method of heating introduces into the production
      process, amongst others that if an autoclave operator adjusts
      heating rates to a lower level in order to avoid over-heating of a
      part, the autoclave will require a greater time to cure other
      parts, increasing the time required for the entire production run,
      and that if the parts are distributed improperly, the autoclave
      operator may have to violate the heating rate specifications for
      some of the tools, thus wasting the parts on those tools, in order
      to obtain useful parts from other tools. The solution suggested by
      Lockheed-Martin is to provide load distribution software for
      appropriate positioning of workpieces within a load to be
      introduced into the autoclave. The software includes a layout
      engine for determining the best layout of selected tools in an
      autoclave heating container depending upon (a) the particular
      tools selected, (b) the thermal performance of the tools and (c)
      the thermal characteristics of the autoclave, the layout engine
      generating the resulting pattern on a graphical user interface.
      The layout pattern is determined depending on: <br>
      <br>
      [0006] Thermal response of the tools stored in a database. <br>
      <br>
      [0007] Radial and axial variance in autoclave heating, the slow
      responding tools being laid out in regions of high heating and the
      fast responding tools being located in regions of low heating. <br>
      <br>
      [0008] Uniform airflow around the load. <br>
      <br>
      [0009] Feasibility of loading in the indicated pattern. <br>
      <br>
      [0010] However, Lockheed-Martin give no detailed directions about
      how a layout engine should be written and what calculations it
      should perform, particularly as regards uniformity of airflow. <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</span> <br>
      <br>
      [0011] The present invention is based on the premise that in order
      to be in a position to treat loads that differ in mass, shape and
      cross-section along their length and to improve the chance that
      the whole load can receive the intended heat treatment, it is
      inherently better to modify the characteristics of an autoclave to
      take account of the characteristics of the load rather than to
      accept whatever characteristics the autoclave happens to have and
      modify the characteristics of the load. <br>
      <br>
      [0012] One problem that arises when complex loads are heat treated
      in autoclaves is that at different positions along the autoclave
      there may be differences in the relative position or the
      cross-section of the load, said differences in an autoclave with
      axial gas circulation changing the speed of the circulating gas
      and hence of heat transfer to the load. <br>
      <br>
      [0013] That problem is solved according to the invention by a
      method of heat treating a load as aforesaid in an autoclave, which
      method includes circulating heated gas within the load space by a
      plurality of gas circulation means spaced along its length and
      each causing the heated gas to circulate generally non-axially of
      the load space and/or to impinge non-axially onto the load. <br>
      <br>
      [0014] Thus the invention may comprise an autoclave for
      heat-treating a load, said autoclave comprising: <br>
      <br>
      [0015] a shell defining a pressurizable heating chamber; <br>
      <br>
      [0016] means within the shell defining a load space; <br>
      <br>
      [0017] at least one door for closure of the heating chamber and
      for permitting entry of loads into and discharge of loads from the
      load space; <br>
      <br>
      [0018] means for heating the gas within the load space, and <br>
      <br>
      [0019] a plurality of impellers and respective driving means
      spaced apart at intervals along the heating chamber each for
      non-axial circulation of gas in a respective zones of said load
      space. <br>
      <br>
      [0020] The invention further comprises an autoclave for heat
      treatment of a load whose position relative to the autoclave
      and/or whose cross-section may vary along the load, said autoclave
      comprising: <br>
      <br>
      [0021] a chamber for receiving the load, said chamber having first
      and second ends and an axis that passes through said first and
      second ends, the wall of said chamber providing the first end; <br>
      <br>
      [0022] a door providing the second end of the chamber and giving
      access for insertion and removal of the load; <br>
      <br>
      [0023] means for heating gas in said chamber; and <br>
      <br>
      [0024] heated gas circulation means arranged to produce a pattern
      of circulation in which heating gas circulates generally
      non-axially of the load space and/or impinges non-axially onto the
      load. <br>
      <br>
      [0025] Another problem that arises when complex loads are heat
      treated in autoclaves is that at different positions along the
      autoclave there may be differences in the thermal characteristics
      of the load, which in an autoclave with axial gas circulation may
      be difficult to overcome merely by adjusting the distribution of
      the load to take account of known or forecast differences in heat
      transfer rate with position. <br>
      <br>
      [0026] That problem is solved according to the invention by a
      method of heat treating a load whose thermal characteristics vary
      with position along the load, which method comprises heating the
      load in an autoclave having a plurality of gas circulation means
      spaced along its length and each producing a zone for circulation
      of heating gas, the gas circulation in said zones being
      independently controllable. With this method, a load of variable
      geometry and mass can be heated at different temperatures along
      its length or at different speeds of gas circulation in order to
      raise the temperature of the mass as a whole at a uniform rate. <br>
      <br>
      [0027] The invention further provides an autoclave or oven for
      heat treatment of a load whose thermal characteristics may vary
      along its length, said autoclave comprising: <br>
      <br>
      [0028] a chamber for receiving the load, said chamber having first
      and second ends, the wall of said chamber providing the first end;
      <br>
      <br>
      [0029] a door providing the second end of the chamber and giving
      access for insertion and removal of the load; <br>
      <br>
      [0030] means for heating gas in said chamber; and <br>
      <br>
      [0031] a plurality of gas circulation means spaced along the
      length of the autoclave and each producing a zone for circulation
      of heating gas, the gas circulation in said zones being
      independently controllable. <br>
      <br>
      [0032] The aforesaid problems are not mutually exclusive, and
      indeed will commonly occur together. <br>
      <br>
      [0033] Thus in a further aspect the invention provides an
      autoclave for heat treatment of a load whose position relative to
      the autoclave, whose cross-section and/or whose thermal
      characteristics may vary along the load, said autoclave
      comprising: <br>
      <br>
      [0034] a chamber for receiving the load, said chamber having first
      and second ends and an axis that passes through said first and
      second ends, the wall of said chamber providing the first end; <br>
      <br>
      [0035] a door providing the second end of the chamber and giving
      access for insertion and removal of the load; <br>
      <br>
      [0036] means for heating gas in said chamber; and <br>
      <br>
      [0037] a plurality of gas circulation means spaced along the
      length of the autoclave and each producing a zone for circulation
      of heating gas, the gas circulation in said zones being
      independently controllable and said gas circulation means being
      arranged to produce a pattern of circulation in which heating gas
      impinges non-axially onto the load. <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED FEATURES
      </span><br>
      <br>
      [0038] The above autoclave is divided longitudinally into a
      sequence of treatment zones, and preferably the means for
      controlling the rate of heat transfer between the heating gas and
      the load in each zone comprises an impeller. It has been found
      that the impeller can provide a dual function: firstly adjusting
      the speed of the circulating gas and hence the coefficient of heat
      transfer to the load and secondly acting as a source of heat for
      the heating gas because of the high power input which is required
      in practice to produce gas circulation at the required velocity or
      mass flow, especially at the typical working pressures of 5-25 bar
      found in the autoclave, means preferably being provided for
      independently adjusting the friction heat generated in said
      heating gas by the impeller of each treatment zone. It has been
      found in practice that providing one or more thermocouples in the
      autoclave measuring gas temperature and load temperature and using
      a difference between measured and required temperatures to
      generate a difference signals to adjust the impeller speeds and
      hence the amount of friction heat that the impellers generate
      provides fine temperature control and can enable load temperatures
      of .+-.1.degree. C. to be achieved during the load heating phase
      of the autoclave processing cycle. The means for controlling the
      rate of heat transfer between the heating gas and the load in each
      zone preferably also comprises cooling means for cooling gas
      circulating in said zone. The ability to adjust the rate of gas
      flow in zones along the length of the autoclave and optionally in
      different regions within a single zone is of particular value
      during the cooling part of a treatment cycle in order to take
      account of differences in gas flow path around different regions
      along the load and also differences in the heat capacities of tool
      and workpiece at different regions along the load. The provision
      of independent adjustments for primary heat zone-wise or in a
      group of zones, mass flow rate in each zone, friction heat
      generation in each zone and cooling in each zone enables a high
      degree of stability to be achieved. <br>
      <br>
      [0039] As regards heating the circulating gas, electricity is one
      possible heat source, in which case it is convenient to provide an
      independent heater for heating gas circulating in each zone. In
      the case of gas, steam or oil heating e.g. using radiant tubes,
      the heating means may comprise at least a first heater that is
      common to a group of zones and typically at least first and second
      heaters for first and second groups of zones. Control means may be
      adapted to create differential conditions in at least one zone in
      a time-varying pattern, thereby to transfer gas axially between
      zones. <br>
      <br>
      [0040] The pattern of gas circulation is non-axial and is
      transverse to the axis or longitudinal dimension of the load space
      which typically has an aspect ratio greater than one. Means are
      preferably provided in each zone for establishing a
      circumferential bilobal circulation of gas, the plane of said
      circumferential bilobal circulation being generally at right
      angles to said longitudinal direction or axis. In order to achieve
      such a circulation pattern, the autoclave may further comprise
      spaced oppositely facing inner wall portions defining with a side
      wall of the chamber spaces for flow of gas along the circumference
      of said chamber, a first aperture defined between said inner wall
      portions for entry of gas into said flow spaces, and a second
      aperture defined between said inner wall portions opposite the
      first aperture for gas leaving the flow spaces and flowing through
      said chamber towards the first aperture. In order to increase the
      mass flow of heated gas traveling over the load and hence the
      coefficient of heat transfer, it is preferred to provide means for
      reducing the volume of gas above the load and hence increasing the
      speed of the gas. For this purpose at least one gas deflection
      means is preferably provided in said autoclave for varying the
      velocity of gas adjacent to the load, and actuator means is
      preferably connected to the gas deflection means for adjustment of
      the position thereof from the exterior of said chamber. <br>
      <br>
      [0041] The above autoclave may be used for heat treating an
      elongated article with its longest dimension directed generally
      parallel to the axis of the autoclave, and the heat treatment is
      carried out so as to heat the article according to a predetermined
      pattern, usually so that it rises in temperature evenly along its
      length. The article may be non-linear in its longitudinal
      direction e.g. a panel for an aircraft wing having both
      longitudinal and transverse curvature. <br>
      <br>
      [0042] Typically the load comprises articles each consisting of a
      workpiece in contact with a tool, the workpiece being heat treated
      and being shaped by contact with the tool as in the forming of
      composites by a combination of evacuation of the interface between
      the composite and the forming tool and application of pressure of
      the hot gaseous atmosphere within the autoclave. The autoclave has
      as one of its main uses the treatment of a single workpiece and a
      single forming tool extending along a major part of the internal
      space of the autoclave. It can also be used for the het treatment
      of a plurality of workpieces and forming tools extending in
      side-by-side relationship along a major portion of the internal
      space of the autoclave. It may also be used for the heat treatment
      of a plurality of workpieces and forming tools disposed end to end
      in series along the internal space. Use of an autoclave to make
      shaped parts is not limited to the production of parts in curable
      plastics or composite materials, but also includes parts made in
      metal that are required to undergo a heat treatment to change
      their shape or improve their properties. <br>
      <br>
      [0043] Age creep forming is a process that can be used for forming
      metallic plates into a desired contoured shape, for example to
      give an aluminium or alloy wing panel its aerofoil shape. The
      practical steps involved in age creep forming are closely
      analogous to those involved in moulding a curable composition.
      Following machining, a metal panel is placed onto a mould and
      covered with a sheet of a plastics material that resists high
      temperatures. The assembly is placed in an autoclave, the air
      beneath the sheet is evacuated and the interior of the autoclave
      is pressurised, forcing the panel tightly onto the mould, and the
      autoclave is heated e.g. to about 220.degree. C. After a period of
      e.g. 24 hours the panel is cooled to room temperature and removed
      from the autoclave. U.S. Pat. No. 4,188,811 (Chem-tronics)
      discloses a process for shaping a metallic workpiece that uses a
      single-faced die and the use of heat and pressure to conform the
      workpiece to the shape of the die surface by creep forming. In
      particular, the patent discloses a process for altering the shape
      of a metallic workpiece which comprises the steps of: placing the
      workpiece on the face of a die which face has a configuration
      wanted in the workpiece and concurrently heating said workpiece
      and applying pressure thereto via a compliant body composed of
      discrete pieces of a heat resistant, pressure transmitting
      material and located on that side of the workpiece opposite the
      die, the temperature to which the workpiece is heated and the
      pressure applied thereto being so correlated as to cause the
      workpiece metal to flow plastically at a stress below its yield
      strength into contact with the face of said die to thereby impart
      the wanted configuration to the workpiece. More recent references
      to creep forming occur in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,345,799 (Aliteco AG)
      and 6,264,771 (Bornschlegel). <br>
      <br>
      [0044] As previously mentioned, one preferred gas circulation
      pattern within the zones of the autoclave is bilobal with a plane
      of bilobal circulation in each zone directed transversely of the
      axis of the autoclave, and wherein gas at a central region of said
      bilobal circulation impinges onto and/or passes through the tool.
      The tool advantageously has a gas-receiving opening that faces a
      location where gas that has been traveling along a circumferential
      part of its circulation path enters a central part of its
      circulation path in which the gas travels across the load space A
      second preferred gas circulation is tetra-lobal with first and

        EMBODIMENTS</span> <br>
      <br>
      [0056] The present invention is particularly, though not
      exclusively applicable to autoclaves of high aspect ratio, high
      volume or both high volume and high aspect ratio. An autoclave of
      relatively small size but high aspect ratio might be used, for
      example, in the heat treatment or shaping of yacht masts and could
      have a length of e.g. 20 meters and a diameter of 1 meter, with an
      internal volume of about 12 m.sup.3. In the case of both high
      volume and high aspect ratio, the autoclave may be 15 meters in
      length and in a typical installation may be about 35 meters in
      length, there being no specific upper limit in length because of
      the non-axial flow pattern that has been selected. The volume of
      the autoclave may be more than 250 cubic meters, often more than
      500 cubic meters and in a typical installation more than 750 cubic
      meters. The aspect ratio of the load space within the autoclave
      (length to diameter or maximum transverse dimension) may be more
      than three, usually more than 5 and in a typical installation
      about 7. <br>
      <br>
      [0057] The problems that arise when a component such as a panel
      for a large aircraft wing, said panel arising from where the wing
      joins the fuselage of the aircraft, is to be heat treated in a
      conventional autoclave 50 with axial air circulation via fan 52
      are shown in FIG. 2. The wing panel 54 may be, for example, of
      aluminum alloy of section typically 40 mm towards its base and 4
      mm towards its tip with curvature both transversely and
      longitudinally and with change of section gradually all along its
      length. Tooling of steel plate that is typically about 10 mm thick
      supports the panel 54 that is to be creep formed and the panel or
      workpiece is to be pulled down onto a datum surface defined by
      screw jacks distributed along and across the tool. The panel is
      covered by a rubber sheet and is pulled down onto the datum
      surface by vacuum and by the pressure of the gas within the
      autoclave, which will typically be at a pressure of up to 20 bar
      and up to 200.degree. C. <br>
      <br>
      [0058] For creep forming, a typical specification for the thermal
      regime to be undergone by the panel 54 is that it should be heated
      to .+-.2.degree. C. of its target temperature and that the
      thickest part of the panel should achieve its target temperature
      within one hour of the thinnest part. Heat reaches the panel
      mainly by impingement of the heating gas on the rubber cover
      sheet, so that it is necessary to model convection in air,
      conduction through the rubber cover sheet and the thermal capacity
      of the aluminum panel. <br>
      <br>
      [0059] In FIG. 2 the tooling is omitted for the sake of clarity.
      As apparent, gas flows axially away from fan 52 between the
      sidewall 56 of the autoclave and inner wall 58 as indicated by
      arrows 60 and returns inward to provide an axial return flow 62.
      Radiant tube heating elements (not shown) are provided between
      walls 56 and 58. The autoclave is formed in three segments, with a
      segment 62 furthest from the fan, a central segment 64 and a
      segment 66 nearest to the fan. In the segment 62 furthest from fan
      52 the panel 54 is at a relatively wide spacing from inner wall 58
      and gas flow is relatively slow. In the middle segment 64 the gap
      between panel 54 and inner wall 58 has narrowed and gas flow has
      accelerated with a corresponding increase in heat transfer
      coefficient. In the segment 66 nearest the fan 52 because of the
      reverse curvature of the panel 54, the heating gas no longer
      impinges directly on the rubber over-layer and instead part of it
      by-passes it to return directly to the fan as indicated by arrow
      68, while the remainder becomes turbulent as indicated by arrows
      70. In order to overcome the problems imposed by the differing gas
      flow regimes and consequential differences in load (workpiece
      and/or tool) heat transfer coefficient, the fan 52 has to produce
      a very high gas flow which is against a high static head resulting
      from the length of the flow paths and obstruction provided by the
      heaters in the outflow part of the path and the load in the return
      part of the path. Gas flow through the tooling does not contribute
      significantly to processing because the predominant gas flow is
      over the surface of the panel 54 as shown. Inevitably one end of
      the load is cooler than the other. MW of fan power is required,
      with high capital cost, and there is a zero diversity factor. <br>
      <br>
      [0060] The invention overcomes these problems, as shown in FIG. 3
      by providing a generally non-axial flow pattern of heating gas
      with gas circulating circumferentially between inner and outer
      walls of the autoclave where it can be heated by flow past radiant
      tubes and traveling across the load space so that the flow
      impinges onto the load, as indicated by arrows 72. The pattern of
      gas circulation in planes directed generally at right angles to
      the axis of the autoclave provides the opportunity to divide the
      load space into a multiplicity of processing zones in which gas
      flow (speed and temperature) is independently controllable to
      maintain uniform temperature of a load with diversity factors. In
      the present embodiment, circumferential flow for each segment is
      directed through and then downwardly from cooling units mounted at
      and spaced axially along the uppermost region of the autoclave,
      the cooling units being useful firstly for adjustment of the
      temperature of the circulating gas during a heating part of a
      treatment cycle and preventing over-heating of a lightly-loaded or
      non-loaded region of the autoclave and secondly for assisting of
      return of temperature to ambient during a cooling part of the
      treatment cycle. Cooling units 74, 76 and 78 are provided in the
      segment 62, cooling units 80, 82 and 84 are provided in the
      segment 64 and cooling units 88, 90 and 92 are provided in the
      segment 66. The circumferential flow enters the cooling units and
      is then directed downwardly towards the load as shown. For the
      return part of the travel of the gas, impellers in matching units
      under the floor of the autoclave return gas from the load space
      for flow circumferentially between the walls 56, 58. <br>
      <br>
      [0061] Use of a multiplicity of impellers located at intervals
      along the autoclave in addition to sharing the load gives rise to
      a reduced static head at each impeller, so that smaller motors can
      be used without compromising the air movement requirements of the
      autoclave. Smaller motors are easier to manufacture and install
      and provide improved control firstly because the transverse flow
      path or paths controlled by each motor is or are relatively short
      compared to the axial flow path of conventional autoclaves and
      because adjustment of impeller speed can be used not only to
      control mass flow but also to control the amount of friction heat
      imparted at each impeller which especially at relatively high
      autoclave internal pressures can provide a significant proportion
      of the thermal input. The motors preferably have a rated power
      output greater than that needed for gas circulation, so that
      additional power can be used for friction heating of the gas in
      the zone. Use of friction heating which may be important in the
      dwell part of the processing cycle is facilitated if the duty is
      shared by a plurality of motors and impellers located at intervals
      along the autoclave and not simply by a single motor in an end
      wall as in prior art autoclaves. <br>
      <br>
      [0062] A cross-section of the autoclave of FIG. 3 is shown in
      FIGS. 4a-4h in which it is apparent that the autoclave has a side
      wall 56 and oppositely facing arcuate side walls 58, 58a defining
      with the wall 56 circumferential gas circulation spaces 95
      containing gas-fired radiant heater tubes 96. As is apparent from
      FIG. 4a, each segment has six radiant tubes per side fired by six
      gas burners giving twelve radiant tubes and gas burners per
      segment. It will be appreciated that gas fired radiant tubes are
      only an example and that other forms of heating may be employed. A
      load space 98 is defined between the inner walls 58,58a, ceiling
      100 and floor 102, the cooling units, in this case the unit 76
      being ceiling-mounted and the impellers 104 being floor-mounted.
      Load 106 is present in the load space and takes the form of a
      panel to be formed and a forming tool with a blanket of deformable
      material or a rigid second part of the tool covering the panel and
      with means (not shown) for applying a vacuum under the panel to
      assist the forming operation. <br>
      <br>
      [0063] As shown by the arrows in successive figures, heating gas
      from the underside of the load 106 passes into the impeller or fan
      104 (FIG. 4b), from which it is discharged towards gas circulation
      spaces 95 through which it flows circumferentially (FIGS. 4d, 4e),
      until it reaches the cooling unit 76. The impeller or fan will
      normally be a centrifugal fan having a casing, an inlet connected
      to an opening in the floor (in this embodiment) and having
      oppositely facing first and second outlets directed transversely
      of the autoclave. In this way the gas from the load space flows
      zone-wise through the surrounding space at opposite sides of the
      autocalve towards the respective cooling unit e.g. 76. The gas
      leaving the cooling unit passes downwardly onto or into and then
      through a forming tool that forms part of the load 106 (FIGS. 4f,
      4g, 4h) before returning to the underside of the load (FIG. 4b).
      Accordingly there is established in each zone a circumferential
      bilobal circulation pattern, with the load being in a central
      region or load space where the gas flow from the two lobes becomes
      combined and where the gas travels transversely of the load space,
      in this case downwards and can impinge onto the tool to create a
      local turbulent heat-transferring flow pattern. <br>
      <br>
      [0064] Internal lagging 59 of rockwool or other inert thermally
      resistant insulating material is provided as a lining to the outer
      shell of the autoclave to reduce heat transfer the autoclave shell
      during heating and hence the thermal stress on the shell, and also
      to reduce heat transfer from the shell back into the load space
      during the cooling phase of a treatment cycle. In this way the
      energy requirement for each cycle is closer to that required for
      heating and cooling the load or process mass and less energy goes
      into heating and cooling the total mass of the autoclave which
      includes the mass of the vessel or shell and its door or doors.
      Energy that goes into heating or cooling the autoclave shell
      during each treatment cycle is wasted energy and is desirably
      minimized. The arcuate side walls 58,58a, ceiling 100 and floor
      102 form a continuous surface so that all the air flow from
      impeller 104 passes through the gas circulation space 95 to the
      cooling unit 76 and there are no air gaps which could give rise to
      overspill. The absence of air gaps is not critical and, for
      example, ports could be formed in the sidewalls 58, 58a to direct
      heated air onto particular regions of a workpiece and forming tool
      but this is less preferred because such ports are likely to be
      specific to a particular tool and workpiece, so that the autoclave
      would have to be set up specifically for each job. <br>
      <br>
      [0065] The layout of the autoclave of FIG. 3 is diagrammatically
      shown in FIG. 5, which is a schematic view of the autoclave and an
      associated control system. The segments 62, 64, 66 are heated by
      radiant tubes 110 and fired by gas burners 112 as described e.g.
      in EP-B-0176508 and EP-B-0333389. The radiant tubes are
      represented in the diagrammatic section that forms part of FIG. 5c
      as G1-G12, and are directed axially, each passing through three
      heating zones each defined by independently controllable coolers
      74, 76, 78, 80, 82, 84, 88, 90, 92 and by independently
      controllable impellers 114, 116, 118; 120, 122, 124; and 126, 128,
      130. The gas burners for each segment have associated
      thermocouples G1-G12 which measure the temperature of the
      circumferential air and pass signals to a respective one of
      segment heater logic units ICU 7, ICU 9 and ICU 11 that in turn
      pass command signals to progressive gas burner controllers 132,
      134, 136 associated with the respective segments (cold&lt;SP). The
      three heater logic units receive heat enable commands 138, 140,
      142 from fan and cooler logic units ICU 6, ICU 8 and ICU 10 for
      the three segments. <br>
      <br>
      [0066] In the first zone, thermocouples A1 and A2 measure the
      temperature of the flow exiting impeller 114, and thermocouples A3
      and A4 measure the flow entering cooler unit 74 the difference
      providing a measure of the heat taken up by the load or during a
      cooling part of the cycle energy released from the load, the
      thermocouples occurring in pairs because of the bilobal flow
      pattern. In the second zone thermocouples A5 and A6 measure the
      temperature of air exiting impeller 116 and thermocouples A7 and
      A8 monitor the temperature of air entering cooler unit 76. In the
      third zone, thermocouples A9 and A10 monitor the temperature of
      air leaving impeller 118 and thermocouples A11 and A12 monitor the
      temperature of air entering cooler unit 78. Signals from the
      twelve thermocouples are supplied to the unit ICU6, ICU7 or ICU8
      which in addition to providing gas burner command signals also
      provides command signals Z1, Z2, Z3 to proportional cooling valves
      144, 146 and 148 (Hot&gt;SP) and similar signals to friction heat
      inverters 150, 152, 154 (Hot.+-.SP) for the impellers of each
      zone. Accordingly if the gas in any zone is sufficiently below the
      set point, then the gas burners 112 of the radiant tubes 1109 can
      be switched on. If the temperature of the gas in any zone is above
      the set point, cooling can be initiated, and adjusting inverter
      power for each zone can compensate fine deviations in gas
      temperature. <br>
      <br>
      [0067] The operation of the autoclave depends not only on
      measurements of heating system temperature and of gas temperature
      but also on measurement of load (tool or workpiece) temperature.
      For that purpose, load sensor thermocouples 1-33 and reference
      thermocouples 1-4 are allocated to segment 62, load sensor
      thermocouples 34-67 and reference thermocouples 5-8 are allocated
      to segment 64 and load sensor thermocouples 68-100 and reference
      thermocouples 9-12 are allocated to segment 66. Logic units ICU
      1-ICU 4 feed signals for the hottest and the coldest of groups of
      thermocouples that they monitor to temperature control logic ICU
      5. In this way the temperature of the process mass
      (tooling+workpiece) may be sensed zone-wise and the control unit
      can respond both to deviations of the whole process mass from the
      intended temperature and also to deviations from the intended
      temperature within individual zones. <br>
      <br>
      [0068] As shown at 156 (FIG. 5c), the processing cycle to be
      carried out by the autoclave which is stored at device 156 will
      normally include a relatively simple pressure cycle 158 that
      provides for pressurization of the autoclave, dwell at pressure
      and release of pressure on completion of the cooling phase of the
      treatment cycle. A workpiece processing cycle 160 that coincides
      with the pressure cycle has a predetermined rate of temperature
      rise, dwell time at the intended processing temperature and a
      predetermined rate of temperature return to ambient. The cycle of
      processing gas temperature 162 is usually more complex, with the
      gas temperature leading the workpiece temperature during the
      heating part of the cycle, and with a ratio between those
      temperatures being a factor that determines the coefficient of
      heat transfer. From device 156, information is supplied to
      pressure controllers 164 for the three segments, and temperature
      set points are supplied to air/load temperature ratio controllers
      166, 168, 170. <br>
      <br>
      [0069] If any of the workpiece or control thermocouples indicate
      too low a temperature, then logic ICU5 (FIG. 5c) supplies
      information to dwell/cold/hold logic 165 which is also supplied
      with the temperature set-point and which may return a signal to
      device 156 to vary e.g. the air temperature set point. Device ICU
      5 is also concerned with spread control. If one of the
      thermocouples in the group is at or near the required temperature
      while others are at too low a temperature, then the logic causes
      supply of additional heat to be reduced (Hold) until the
      temperature of the cold areas has caught up. If a thermocouple in
      any of the segments is hot, then a signal is sent to the ratio
      controller 166, 168 or 170 to reduce heating in the segment where
      the thermocouple in question is sited. The signal is passed both
      to the segment heater logic unit ICU 7, 9 or 11 and also to the
      fan and cooler logic units for the adjoining segments. Thus if one
      of the thermocouples 1-33 or one of the reference thermocouples
      1-4 gives a HOT signal, then a signal is passed to the ratio
      controller 166 for segment 62 for reduction of gas burner heat
      and/or impeller friction heat and to pulse speed input of fan and
      cooler logic ICU 8 for adjoining segment 64 to adjust the friction
      heat developed any or all of the zones in that segment. Similarly,
      if one of the thermocouples 34-67 or one of the reference
      thermocouples 5-8 gives a HOT signal, then a signal is passed to
      the ratio controller 168 for segment 64 for reduction of gas
      burner heat and/or impeller friction heat and to pulse speed input
      of fan and cooler logic units ICU 6 and ICU 10 for adjoining
      segments 62 and 66 to adjust the friction heat developed any or
      all of the zones in those segments. Again, if one of the
      thermocouples 68-100 or one of the reference thermocouples 9-12
      gives a HOT signal, then a signal is passed to the ratio
      controller 170 for segment 66 for reduction of gas burner heat
      and/or impeller friction heat and to pulse speed input of fan and
      cooler logic ICU 8 for adjoining segment 64 to adjust the friction
      heat developed any or all of the zones in that segment. The
      control circuit therefore enables a relatively coarse response to
      be carried out segment-wise to major low or high deviations of
      gas, tool or workpiece temperature, and more finely tuned
      zone-wise responses to smaller temperature fluctuations from the
      intended heat treatment cycle using zone-wise cooling, zone-wise
      adjustment of the rate of mass flow by change in impeller speed
      and zone-wise change in friction heat generation. <br>
      <br>
      [0070] As indicated above load sensor couples TC-1 to TC-100 are
      provided may be positioned e.g. at the underside of the tool,
      and/or at the interface between the tool and the workpiece and/or
      to the free surface of the workpiece. The ability to control the
      friction heat supplied via the impellers on the basis of measured
      local tool temperature is a significant advantage of the
      invention. It has also been found that although the heat from the
      gas burners is important during heating to the required process
      temperature, when working at pressures of e.g. 7-15 bar the
      friction heat from the impellers can provide most if not all of
      the heat required to maintain the required stable temperature
      within the load space. A practical embodiment of the autoclave
      described above has been constructed by the applicants and has
      achieved a total spatial uniformity within a 5.5 meter diameter
      and a 40 meter length of .+-.1.2.degree. C. immediately on
      installation, and with a tool in place has achieved a total
      spatial uniformity of .+-.1.8.degree. C. The applicants expect to
      achieve even greater spatial uniformity when the autoclave is
      finally configured and tuned and in particular to achieve a
      spatial uniformity with a tool in place of .+-.1.0.degree. C. or
      better. <br>
      <br>
      [0071] FIG. 6 is a cross-section of an alternative embodiment of
      an autoclave of the invention in which each zone is electrically
      heated with an overhead heater and cooled as required by a floor
      radiator, the flow of gas across the load chamber impinging onto a
      molding tool from its underside. One possible use of the autoclave
      is for the molding and curing of large panels of resin reinforced
      carbon fiber or other composite materials for use in airliners.
      The autoclave has sidewall 180 and inner walls 182, 182a defining
      passages 184, 184a for circumferential flow of heating gas
      together with a ceiling 186 and a floor 188. An impeller 190
      brings about flow of gas from load space 191 through electrical
      heaters 192, 192a and through passages 184, 184a to radiator 194
      which contains cooling elements and from which the gas returns to
      the load space 191. Gas entering the load space passes through
      trolley 196 and tool 198 so that it impinges on the underside of
      the molding surface of the tool. The panel to be molded is on the
      upper surface of the tool and is of negligible thickness, and it
      has been omitted for the sake of clarity. The upper face of the
      panel may also need to be molded e.g. because it has one or more
      upstanding integrally formed ribs, and for that purpose the carbon
      fiber lay-up may be covered with a second part of the tool, also
      omitted for clarity. Gas flows along the underside of the tool
      towards the periphery of the autoclave as shown by the arrows, and
      is returned towards the tool so as to heat the upper mold part
      that rests on the carbon fiber lay-up by means of movable baffles
      200, 200a whose positions are adjustable from outside the
      autoclave by actuators 202, 202a. A gap between the baffles 200,
      200a permits the gas to return to the impeller 190 as shown. The
      baffles 200, 200a reduce the volume of gas above the tool 198,
      with the consequences that the velocity of the gas and hence its
      coefficient of heat transfer to the tool is increased. <br>
      <br>
      [0072] In order to minimize variations in load temperature axially
      of the autoclave, it may be desirable to provide means for
      conveying gas axially from one zone to the other. In order to
      achieve such conveyance, a cyclically varying pattern of
      circulation conditions may be applied to at least one zone that
      shifts axially of the autoclave. For example, adjacent zones may
      vary in temperature individually and cyclically as in FIGS. 7a and
      7b. Alternatively a zone of high temperature may be followed by
      two zones of lower temperature as in FIGS. 8a-8c. The cyclical
      variation in temperature from zone to zone may conveniently be
      achieved by adjustment of the friction heat of the impellers
      114-130 via logic units ICU 6-ICU 10 and inverters 150-154. <br>
      <br>
      [0073] Various modifications may be made to the illustrated
      embodiments without departing from the invention. <br>
      <br>
      [0074] For example, the drawings have illustrated cases where
      firstly the heater is in the ceiling and the cooling radiators are
      in the floor, gas flowing downwardly through the load space to
      provide hot air impingement from above, and secondly the cooling
      radiators are positioned in the ceiling and the hot air is ducted
      to rise from under the floor into the load space through which it
      flows upwardly into the base of the tooling to provide hot air
      impingement from below. Although these airflow directions may
      often be convenient, the direction of airflow is arbitrary and
      could for example be side to side, the heater and cooling radiator
      being correspondingly placed. Furthermore, the flow can be
      established using more than one impeller per zone, the fans being
      located above and below the workpiece and tool or to either side
      of the workpiece and tool to provide hot air imingement from above
      and below or from opposed sides. <br>
      <br>
      [0075] In FIG. 9 there is shown an autoclave having a single large
      vessel rather than three vessels joined in series, and having an
      aspect ratio of less than 3. One end 222 of the vessel is closed
      and the other end is closable by a door 224 which can be
      manipulated by gantry crane 226. The autoclave is divided
      longitudinally into heating zones as in the previous embodiments,
      and a cross-section of one such zone appears in FIG. 10. A pair of
      impellers 228, 230 are located 180.degree. apart within the shell
      232 which is internally insulated by insulation 234 e.g. of
      rockwool. Sidewalls 229, 231 separate the load space from heaters
      236, 238 which occur in two banks each associated with a
      respective impeller. Also associated with each impeller is a
      cooler (not shown) for forced cooling of the gas within the
      autoclave during the cooling phase of each tratment cycle. The
      walls 229 and 231 are spaced apart at an equatorial region of the
      autoclave to define therebetween openings 240, 242 for jets of air
      into the load space as shown by arrows 244, 246. These jets can
      impinge from opposite directions onto a workpiece and tool when
      present in the load space, and a gas flow can be eatablished which
      is 4-lobal when viewed in transverse cross-section. Such a
      multiple zone arrangement may be desirable where it is required to
      maintain a high level of mass air flow whilst retaining motors of
      sensible proportions. The speeds of the impellers 228 and 230 may
      be controlled individually by respective control means to provide,
      if desired, not only separately controllable heating and cooling
      for each individual zone along the autoclave but also separately
      controllable heating and cooling for individual regions within
      each such zone. <br>
      <br>
      [0076] FIGS. 11 and 12 show a further autoclave according to the
      invention in which a generally cylindrical shell 300 is closed at
      opposed ends by doors 302, 304 and has an internal load space
      divided longitudinally into five independently controllable
      heating zones 306a-306e. Each heating zone has an associated
      impeller 308a-308e driven by motor 310a-310e, first heat exchanger
      312a-312e for heating the gas in the load space by gaseous
      combustion products and second heat exchanger 314c (FIG. 14; the
      second heat exchangers are not shown in FIG. 11) for cooling the
      gas in the load space by contact with water circulating through
      cooling pipes. The gas in each zone is heated by heat exchange
      with the combustion gas associated with the first heat exchanger
      and by the friction heat imparted by the impeller and may be
      cooled both during the heating part of the treatment cycle to
      assist temperature control of the gas in that zone and during the
      cooling part of the treatment cycle to speed up return to ambient
      temperature. The control system may be generally as described with
      reference to FIGS. 5a-5c, and in particular it may provide for
      feedback control of the friction heat generated in each zone by
      respective impellers 308a-308e in accordance with temperatures
      sensed by thermocouples attached to the load within the autoclave.
      The provision of doors 302,304 at each end of the autoclave shell
      enables the autoclave to be positioned within a product flow line
      so that the untreated products can enter at one end of the
      autoclave and be discharged from the other end, the non-axial gas
      flow of the invention enabling the doors of the autoclave to be
      free of impellers and drive motors for the impellers which would
      otherwise add weight and bulk. As is apparent in FIG. 12, the
      vessel 300 is lined with one or more layers of thermally
      insulating material 316, and the load space is defined by floor
      318, sidewalls 320a, 320b and ceiling 322, an opening in the floor
      318 leading to the impeller 308c and an opening in the ceiling 322
      leading from the heat exchanger 310c into the load space.
      Operation of the impeller establishes a toroidal circulation of
      gas from the load space between the sidewalls 320a, 320b and then
      returning from the first heat exchanger 310c into the load space
      as indicated by arrows 324. <br>
      <br>
      [0077] Referring to FIGS. 12 and 13 gas in line 330 and air in
      line 332 are fed to burner 334 in combustion space 336. The
      products of combustion are fed via line 338 to manifold 340 of
      heat exchange pipe array 342. The gas from array 342 after heat
      exchange with the gas in the combustion space is extracted via
      manifold 344 and line 346 to optional fan 348 and then discharged.
      Typically the gas mixture fed to burner 344 is about 300%
      over-aerated to moderate the temperature of the products of
      combustion passing through the heat exchanger tubes and hardness
      and embrittlement of the heat exchanger tubes. Depending on the
      heat transfer characteristics required in any particular
      installation, the tubes of the array 342 may be plain or may carry
      fins, as also may the tubes of the second heat exchanger. The
      cooler for each zone may be one or more water-filled cooling tube
      arrays located beneath the floor 318 on the upstream or downstream
      side of the impeller 308, it may be a serpentine tube 314c (plain
      or with cooling fins) located between the walls 320a, 320b and the
      insulation 316 or it may be located in the space above the ceiling
      322 upstream or downstream of the heat exchanger 312a-312e. <br>
