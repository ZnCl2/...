        <p><b><font size="+1">Canadian Gadget Would Boost Mileage, Cut
              Pollution</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p><i>Toronto</i> -- A new gadget designed by a Canadian inventor
        to boost auto gasoline mileage and cut pollution is to appear in
        auto parts stores next fall. </p>
      <p>A brainchild of Andrew MacGuire, the "narrow band air-fuel
        ratio control" has sparked the interest of a major Eurpoean car
        maker. If that manufacturer ultimately decides to make the
        control a standard item, it will become common in millions of
        cars around the world. </p>
      <p>But if that happens, most of the jobs and income the invention
        creates will end up in the United States. The reason is that
        Andrew MacGuire appears to be another creative Canadian who has
        been driven into the arms of the Americans by cautious Canadian
        business. </p>
      <p>The British-born MacGuire, 57, has lived here for 30 years and
        has been inventing since the end of the Second World War. He has
        37 patents to his name. </p>
      <p>He put the first prototype of his air-fuel mixture control
        together in 1964. </p>
      <p>As opposed to today's catalytic converters, which cut down
        pollution by treating engine exhaust, the macGuire control is
        designed to deal with the problem before the fuel is burned. </p>
      <p>It sucks up air and passes it along to the carburetor where gas
        and air are mixed before they are sent along to the cylinders
        for burning. </p>
      <p>The control breaks the air into pulses and those pulses, in
        turn, break up the gas-air mixture into a fine mist. </p>
      <p>This mist, says MacGuire, burns more thoroughly and gets more
        consistent performance out of each cylinder.&nbsp; And that, he
        maintains, means greater fuel efficiency, higher engine
        performance and less pollution. </p>
      <p>Over the last 8 years, says MacGuire, 3000 controls have been
        tested under the most rigorous conditions. In the past 2 years
        they have been subject to computer analysis. </p>
      <p>The information, he says, indicates the control will give a
        well-tuned engine 12-19 percent more mileage. On the pollution
        side, he says, "without any trouble at all the device can reduce
        hydrocarbons by more than 50% and carbon monoxide by more than
        75%. </p>
      <p>Most computer tests show that when the control and the
        catalytic converter are uysed together, hydrocarbon and carbon
        monoxide emissions are wiped out. </p>
      <p>The plastic control, which weighs about 3 ounces, is expected
        to sell for about $30 professionally installed. </p>
      <p>Over the past 9 years Ferry Cap and Screw Set of Cleveland has
        invested $400,000 on the development of MacGuire's invention. </p>
      <p>MacGuire says he went to Ferry after showing the control to two
        Canadian concerns. </p>
      <p>His efforts to find Canadian support were "half-hearted"
        because, over the years, most Canadian firms had reacted slowly
        and unenthusiastically to his notions. </p>
      <p>"Canadian businessmen don't seem to have that flair for trying
        something out. I've been told, 'We don't have to bother. We'll
        get it from the USA in a year or two anyway'. Large Canadian
        companies take so long that you could just starve before they
        made a decision." </p>
      <p>Ferry bought his idea, and his basic patent, in 36 hours and
        "have treated me very generously." </p>
      <p>Ferry has had the control patented in most of the industrial
        countries in the world. </p>
      <p>The company says it hopes Canadian government agencies will buy
        teh control for their vehicles. The big breakthrough, however,
        will come if a European auto maker decides to make it standard
        on cars. </p>
      <p>So far, says MacGuire, North American auto makers have been
        cool to the control. </p>
      <p>Their cars have the catalytic ocnverter. Beyond that says
        MacGuire, they are victims of the "not-invented-in-the-US
        syndrome." </p>

      <p><b>Abstract</b> -- Valve device and system employing same for
        providing variations in air flow to the manifold of an internal
        combustion engine in accordance with the engine vacuum. The
        valve device includes a plurality of resiliently deformable
        spherical members which are caused to resonate over
        substantially the full operating range of the engine, whereby
        the auxiliary air passing through the valve pulsates creating
        turbulence in the air flow into the manifold resulting in shock
        waves which assist in breaking up the fuel into smaller, more
        uniform particle sizes and maintaining a more constant air/fuel
        mixture over the full operating range. The valve body is in the
        shape of a Tee having a hollow-cylindrical portion containing
        the spherical members and oppositely extending tubular arms in
        communication therewith. One of the arms is plugged, and the
        other arm is connected to the carburetor by a hard plastic or
        metal tube which assists in maintaining the air pulsations
        during passage of the air therethrough. The PCV line extends
        from the crankcase in communication with the tube, whereby the
        pulsating air from the valve device imparts pulsations to the
        air passing through the PCV line thus to maximize the turbulence
        of air flowing into the carburetor. </p>
      <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>The modern automotive internal combustion engine has been
        recognized as a principal contributor to atmospheric pollution,
        and a number of different approaches have been made to the
        problem. Devices of various sorts have been developed to control
        release of crankcase emissions and others have been developed to
        remove harmful products from the exhaust gases. It has, however,
        been recognized that the basic problem would be much ameliorated
        if the engines could be operated under substantially ideal
        conditions so that only small amounts of the objectionable
        pollutants would be produced, as by insuring substantially
        complete combustion of the engine fuel under all operating
        conditions. Examples of devices for such purpose are illustrated
        and described in Mokrzycki U.S. Pat. No. 3,039,449 and Canadian
        Pat. No. 590,030, as well as in Thomasson U.S. Pat. No.
        1,259,317. While illustrating this general approach to the
        problem, such devices have not been flexible enough in operation
        quickly to accommodate rapid changes in engine operating
        conditions, such as rapid acceleration and rapid deceleration,
        to insure a proper air/fuel ratio at all times and thereby
        achieve substantially complete combustion of the fuel. </p>
      <p>Substantially improved results have been obtained with the
        valves and air supply systems of the aforementioned MacGuire
        U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,693,650 and 3,799,132 which supply primary air
        to the engine manifold of an internal combustion engine over
        substantially the entire speed range of the engine for improved
        engine response and acceleration. Such valves and systems insure
        automatic adjustment to various throttle settings and rates of
        acceleration or deceleration, which in the past have commonly
        resulted in a temporary improper fuel/air mixture, and prevent
        the emission of excessive pollutants to the atmosphere,
        particularly carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon vapors. </p>
      <p>It has been found, however, that improved performance of such
        valve and air supply systems can be obtained by proper
        adjustment of the valves to cause the valves to resonate over
        the full operating range of the engine, that is, during idle as
        well as during cruising and acceleration and deceleration. As
        the valves resonate, air pulsations are created causing
        turbulence in the air flow through the valves and into the
        carburetor where pressure waves are set up in the lower part of
        the carburetor and manifold which assist in breaking up the fuel
        into smaller, more uniform particle sizes in addition to
        maintaining a more constant air/fuel mixture over the full
        operating range, for improved combustion efficiency, fuel
        economy, and lower exhaust emissions. </p>
      <p>It has also been found that making the valve housings with a
        right angle turn in the outlet or in the shape of a Tee and
        plugging one of the arms of the Tee has a beneficial effect in
        causing the valve to resonate. Also, utilizing a hard plastic
        such as hard nylon or metal tubing for the delivery line from
        the valves to the carburetor causes the delivery line to
        resonate and thus assist in maintaining the air pulsations
        during passage through the delivery line just prior to entering
        the carburetor. The pulsating air from the valves may also
        effectively be mixed with the air from the positive crankcase
        ventilation line prior to entering the carburetor to impart
        pulsations to the air passing through the PCV line as well to
        maximize the amount of pulsating air flowing into the
        carburetor. </p>
      <p>The plastic balls for the valves are desirably pressure molded
        for more uniform and consistent results, and are preferably made
        of a suitable thermosetting material rather than a thermoplastic
        so as to withstand greater temperature variations without
        adversely affecting the capabilities of the balls to resonate.
        Using an O-ring or a suitable non-hardening sealer around the
        threads of the valve casings or both to prevent air from
        entering the valves except through the normal valve inlets also
        provides for better resonance. </p>
      <p>With the foregoing in mind, it is a principal object of this
        invention to provide a valve and supplemental air supply system
        to the manifold of an internal combustion engine which produces
        air pulsations causing turbulence in the air flow through the
        valve and into the carburetor to assist in obtaining smaller,
        more uniform fuel particle sizes and maintaining a more constant
        air/fuel mixture over the full operating range of the internal
        combustion engine. </p>
      <p>Another object is to provide a method by which such valve and
        system may be adjusted for maximizing such air pulsations. </p>
      <p>Still another object is to provide such a valve and system in
        parallel with the positive crankcase ventilation line so that
        the pulsating air from the valve also imparts pulsations to the
        air passing through the PCV line to maximize the turbulence of
        the air flow entering the carburetor. </p>
      <p>Another object is to provide such a valve and system which will
        obtain more uniform and consistent results over a greater
        temperature range resulting in greater combustion efficiency and
        fuel economy, and reduced exhaust emissions. </p>

      <p><b>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</b> </p>
      <p>Referring now in detail to the drawings and initially to FIG.
        1, there is shown by way of illustration a conventional
        automotive internal combustion engine 1 and a preferred form of
        supplemental air supply system 2, including a valve 3, connected
        thereto. The valve 3 desirably substantially conforms to the
        valve illustrated in FIG. 3 of the aforementioned MacGuire U.S.
        Pat. Nos. 3,693,650 and 3,799,132, incorporated herein by
        reference. Thus, as shown in FIG. 2 herein, the valve 3
        desirably consists of a unitary Tee-shape plastic body 4 having
        a hollow cylindrical portion 5 in communication with oppositely
        extending tubular arms 6, 7. Threadedly adjustably received
        within such cylindrical body portion is a tubular casing 8
        having an integral extension 9 of slightly reduced inner
        diameter than the inner diameter of the casing proper, thereby
        providing a beveled shoulder 10 therebetween. Such casing 8 may
        have an outer hexagonal or octagonal configuration 11 (see FIG.
        1) to facilitate application of a wrench thereto for rotating
        the casing relative to the body and thereby axially shift the
        casing relative to the body. </p>
      <p>The diameter of the opening 12 leading to the interior of the
        body portion 5 to communicate with the arms 6, 7 of the Tee is
        of smaller diameter than the inner diameter of such body
        portion, thereby providing a shoulder 15 for supporting a
        frustoconical serrated washer 16 which may have a circular
        central opening 17 and a number of outer peripheral notches 18
        as shown in FIG. 3. </p>
      <p>Received within the casing 8 are three spheres or balls 20, 21,
        22 of a diameter greater than the internal diameter of the
        extension 9 and greater than the diameter of the central opening
        17 of the washer 16. Such balls are also of somewhat smaller
        diameter than the internal diameter of the casing 8 to provide a
        clearance therebetween for a purpose to be subsequently
        described. By turning the casing as above-described, the
        shoulder 10 (which serves as a valve seat) may be moved toward
        and away from the washer 16 to vary the length of the chamber 23
        containing such balls 20, 21, 22 and to subject the latter to a
        predetermined degree of compression. </p>
      <p>As shown in FIG. 1 of the aforementioned MacGuire patents, the
        valve inlet 25 may be connected by suitable tubing with the
        underside of a conventional air filter 26 on the automotive
        internal combustion engine 1, and the two arms 6, 7 of the valve
        3 may be connected to the engine manifold 27 with which the
        conventional carburetor 28 is also in communication by
        additional tubing. Alternatively, the tubing between the air
        filter 26 and valve 3 may be eliminated and a suitable filter 30
        may be conveniently mounted within the inlet opening 25 of the
        valve as clearly illustrated in FIGS. 1 and 2 of the present
        application to permit fresh air to pass directly into the valve.
        Moreover, instead of providing delivery lines from both of the
        valve arms 6, 7, a single delivery line 31 desirably runs from
        one of the arms 6 directly to the lower portion of the
        carburetor 28, and the other arm 7 is plugged at 32, for a
        purpose to be subsequently described. </p>
      <p>The valve 3 of the present invention is preferably installed
        with the casing 8 extending in a substantially horizontal
        direction, but this is not essential and the device will operate
        regardless of position. The valve body and casing are also
        desirably made of a suitable plastic material such as nylon
        which will not deteriorate under warm operating conditions in
        the presence of oil and gasoline fumes. The valve 3 must of
        course be mounted adjacent the engine, but should be located in
        a position where it will not be subjected to excessive heat, for
        example, on the front bulkhead or in another cool section of the
        engine compartment. </p>
      <p>The balls 20, 21, 22 are desirably pressure molded rather than
        injection molded for more uniform and consistent results,
        providing better roundness of the balls and eliminating the need
        for having to remove any sprues or flashing from the balls. A
        suitable thermosetting polyurethane material is also desirably
        used for the balls rather than a thermoplastic material because
        of its ability to withstand greater temperature ranges without
        adversely affecting the operation of the balls which are
        desirably resiliently deformable and capable of bulging
        laterally within the casing when the balls are unseated due to
        changes in pressure. The flexing of the balls also assists in
        preventing build-up of carbon and other like deposits within the
        device. </p>
      <p>Initially, the casing 8 may be rotated relative to the body
        portion 4 of the valve so as just barely to seat the valve
        member 20 against the shoulder 10. After the engine 1 has been
        started, the casing 8 may then be very slightly rotated until
        the smoothest possible idle is obtained and the elastomeric
        balls 20, 21, 22 are vibrating at resonance. Unless the
        carburetor is badly out of adjustment (e.g. affording a very
        high idle) it will ordinarily not be necessary to make any
        adjustment to the carburetor. However, for best results, the
        engine should be tuned to minimize its emissions before the
        valve 3 is properly adjusted to obtain maximum beneficial
        results. </p>
      <p>The valve 3 should normally be set while the engine is idling
        at about 16 or 17 inches of vacuum or the engine is running at
        about 1500 to 2000 rpms. To set the valve for engines of 1972
        cars or older, the casing 8 should be opened slightly until air
        can be heard rushing through the device and then slowly closed
        to cause the balls to buzz and resonate. When the balls reach
        their highest frequency, the casing 8 should be locked in place
        as by tightening the set screw 33 which is threadedly received
        in an opening 34 in the valve body 4 and engageable with the
        outer surface of the casing 8. For 1973 and '74 cars, the
        carburetors are factory set quite lean, which causes the engines
        to idle quite rough, and therefore instead of setting the valves
        by sound, such valves are more effectively set using an air flow
        meter to measure the air flow through the valves during engine
        idle. For '73 cars, the casing 8 is desirably screwed down until
        the air flow through the valve measures 70 to 90 cubic feet per
        hour, whereas for '74 cars, the air flow through the valve
        should be adjusted to 50 to 70 cubic feet per hour. In either
        case, the setting will be such that the balls will continue to
        resonate as before. </p>
      <p>As the balls resonate, they create shock waves in the air
        stream passing into the manifold. The injection of additional
        pulsating air into the carburetor and manifold increases the
        turbulence of the fuel/air mixture and thoroughly mixes the
        required amount of air with the fuel at the critical point
        within the engine for improved combustion and fast response at
        substantially all engine speeds. The outer peripheral notches 18
        in the washer 16 also create a swirling action of the air
        passing through the valve device, whereby the air enters the
        carburetor and manifold in sonic waves combined with a swirling
        motion for increased turbulence. </p>
      <p>By proper adjustment of the valve 3, the balls 20, 21, 22 can
        be made to resonate over the full operating range of the engine,
        that is, during idle as well as during cruising and acceleration
        and deceleration. In actual practice, it has been found that the
        balls will resonate from about 5" of vacuum to about 25" of
        vacuum, with best resonation between 13" and 19" of vacuum. This
        creates air pulsations causing turbulence in the air flow which
        may be introduced directly into the carburetor 28 through the
        delivery line 31 where pressure waves are set up in the lower
        part of the carburetor and manifold to help break up the fuel
        into smaller more uniform particle sizes and maintain a more
        constant air/fuel mixture over the full operating range. </p>
      <p>It has also been found that making the plastic body 4 with a
        right angle turn in the valve outlet 29 which may also be in the
        shape of a Tee and plugging one of the arms 7 with a suitable
        plug 32 but not the other assists in causing the balls 20, 21,
        22 to resonate over a greater range because of the right angle
        turn at 35 and the oppositely extending swirl chamber 36.
        Moreover, if the delivery line 31 from the valve 3 to the
        carburetor 28 is made of a hard plastic such as nylon or metal
        tubing, the resonation of the balls will be transmitted to the
        delivery line causing the delivery line also to resonate and
        thereby assist in maintaining the air pulsations during passage
        through the delivery line just prior to entering into the
        carburetor for increased turbulence. </p>
      <p>The pulsating air from the valve 3 may also be effectively
        mixed with the air from the positive crankcase ventilation line
        38 prior to entering the carburetor 28, as by providing a Y
        connection 39 on the valve delivery line 31 and connecting the
        PCV line to the Y connection as further illustrated in FIG. 1.
        The result is that the pulsating air from the valve 3 also
        imparts pulsations to the air passing through the PCV line thus
        to maximize the turbulence of the air flow entering the
        carburetor in the manner previously described. </p>
      <p>Improved resonance of the balls 20, 21, 22 will also result if
        an O-ring seal 43 is interposed between an annular flange 44 on
        the tubular casing 8 and the adjacent end of the plastic body to
        prevent air from entering the valve 4 except through the normal
        inlet opening 25. An annular groove 45 may be provided in the
        plastic body end portion 46 for receipt of the O-ring seal 43 as
        shown, and a suitable non-hardening sealer 47 may also be placed
        around the threads of the casing to further assist in making the
        connection between the tubular casing 8 and plastic body portion
        4 airtight. Also, as previously indicated, making the balls out
        of a thermoset material rather than thermoplastic permits the
        balls to withstand greater temperature ranges without adversely
        affecting the resonating characteristics of the balls. </p>
      <p>The amount of supplemental air which is admitted to the
        carburetor through the valve 3 is of course influenced by the
        manifold vacuum (normally about 16 to 17 inches of mercury at
        idle) which serves to unseat the ball valve 20 with consequent
        compression of the balls 20, 21, 22 axially of the casing 8 and
        corresponding lateral bulging of the balls 20, 21, 22 toward the
        wall of the valve chamber 23 within the casing. As previously
        disclosed in the aforementioned MacGuire U.S. Pat. Nos.
        3,693,650 and 3,799,132, if the ball 20 is thus unseated and
        moved axially within the chamber 23 for a considerable distance
        under the influence of very high vacuum in the line, the balls
        20, 21, 22 would be thus laterally bulged to such an extent as
        to very substantially restrict the passage between the same and
        the chamber wall. This imposition of a momentary but
        nevertheless very high vacuum accordingly is ineffective to draw
        as much air through the valve assembly 3 as would otherwise be
        the case. </p>
      <p>Automotive engine carburetors are ordinarily most efficient
        when the vehicle is operating at a speed of approximately 50 to
        60 mph, providing too rich a mixture at idle. By admitting
        supplementary air to the manifold, the system of this invention
        has the effect of providing a smoother idle as well as insuring
        substantially complete combustion of the fuel to minimize
        discharge of carbon monoxide and unburned hydrocarbon. </p>
      <p>As the engine is accelerated gradually the vacuum may drop to
        about 14 inches of mercury and only a litle more additional air
        is admitted to the carburetor through the valve than in the case
        when the engine is at idle. If the engine is now accelerated to
        about 50 mph, for example, the vacuum may drop to about 2 to 3
        inches of mercury and very little supplemental air will pass
        through the valve to the carburetor. </p>
      <p>When the engine is abruptly decelerated, the vacuum may build
        up to approximately 25 inches of mercury, which would be
        expected to draw too much air through the valve device with
        consequent unstable engine operation. The valve device, however,
        automatically eliminates such problem due to the lateral
        expansion of the balls which limits the passage for the air
        through the chamber, and consequently the increase in air flow
        to the manifold is not nearly as substantial as would be
        expected from the abrupt increase in manifold vacuum. The balls
        21, 22 which support the ball valve member 20 and resiliently
        bias the latter toward valve closing position tend thus to be
        laterally deformed to a greater extent than the ball valve
        member 20 itself. This may, however, be regulated as desired by
        employment of balls of varying degrees of resilience. </p>
      <p>As is well known, the PCV valve 41 performs two very important
        functions. First of all, it provides an effective means of
        removing harmful vapors from the crankcase 42 that are created
        through blow-by, and secondly, such harmful vapors and
        pollutants are not discharged directly from the crankcase into
        the atmosphere, but rather are caused to flow back into the
        intake manifold 27 for reburning. The PCV valve 41 is a simple,
        spring-loaded valve that opens and closes according to manifold
        vacuum, and its principal function is to permit maximum flow of
        vapor as the engine speed and thus the vapor volume increases.
        However, it has been found that if the PCV valve 41 is connected
        in parallel with the valve 3 in the manner previously described,
        better engine performance results, presumably because the
        turbulence of the air flow entering the carburetor is maximized.
        On the other hand, if the PCV valve 41 is bad or defective (i.e.
        stuck or clogged), connecting it in parallel with the valve 3
        may have an adverse effect on the operation of the valve 3, and
        therefore it is important to make certain the PCV valve is
        operative before making such a connection. The valve 3 will not
        adversely affect the operation of the PCV valve, primarily
        because at high vacuum demand, the valve 3 will tend to close
        off. </p>
      <p>In a typical installation for the purpose described, the balls
        20, 21, 22 may be 1/2 inch in diameter and the inner diameter of
        the chamber 23 in the casing 8 may be only several hundredths of
        an inch greater. Despite the tendency of such balls to bulge
        laterally as the valve 20 opens more and more, such bulging will
        not ordinarily be to an extent sufficient entirely to close off
        the passage for fluid flow through the chamber, there being an
        automatic self-compensating effect whereby the force tending to
        open the valve is diminished gradually as such passage becomes
        more and more restricted. Pressure molding the balls also
        enhances their roundness and eliminates flashings or sprues on
        the balls for more uniform and consistent results. </p>
      <p>The density of the balls and particularly the last ball 22 will
        also influence the resonating characteristics of the balls to a
        great extent. If, for example, the last ball 22 which is resting
        against the star washer 16 is softer, the device will resonate
        at lower air flow. However, using too soft or resilient balls
        may restrict the range of frequency over which the balls will
        resonate, and very soft or resilient balls also become too
        spongy and their resilience is no longer of any value. </p>
      <p>The valve assembly 3 should desirably be fully insulated from
        the engine and other metal parts to avoid stripping of negative
        charges from the air delivered to the engine, and where a metal
        air delivery line 31 is used, rubber or other insulating coating
        may be used to insulate the delivery line from the engine where
        it is connected to the carburetor. It has also been found
        advantageous to locate the valve assembly and the air intake
        therefor out on the front bulkhead or in a cool section of the
        engine compartment to minimize the loss of electrons due to
        heat. </p>
      <p>The construction of the valve assembly 3 is such that its
        operation is not affected by engine or road vibration. The
        assembly is light in weight, inexpensive, and easily installed
        and provides a degree of protection against the dangers of a
        faulty exhaust system since discharge of lethal carbon monoxide
        may be much diminished thereby. </p>
      <p>The device also permits adjustment of the carburetor to provide
        a richer air/fuel mixture so that the engine will run better,
        while still obtaining the desired atomizing effect and
        maintaining the desired fuel/air mixture over substantially the
        entire operating range of the engine which has a beneficial
        effect on combustion efficiency, fuel economy, and exhaust
        emissions. The air pulsations created by the valve have the
        desirable effect of atomizing the fuel, and also help to more
        fully disperse and spread out the fuel which creates more
        uniformity in fuel/air mixture. </p>
      <p>Although the invention has been shown and described with
        respect to a preferred embodiment, it is obvious that equivalent
        alterations and modifications will occur to others skilled in
        the art upon the reading and understanding of this
        specification. The present invention includes all such
        equivalent alterations and modifications, and is limited only by
        the scope of the claims. </p>
