          Enamel, Treats Cavities</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      A team of scientists at the University of Washington has developed
      a new dental product that uses protein amelogenin-derived peptides
      to remineralize tooth enamel and treat cavities...<br>
      `<br>
      The study authors accomplished this by capturing the essence of
      amelogenin — a protein crucial to forming the hard crown enamel —
      to design amelogenin-derived peptides that biomineralize and are
      the key active ingredient in the new technology....<br>
      <br>
      “These peptides are proven to bind onto tooth surfaces and recruit
      calcium and phosphate ions,” said study co-author Deniz Yucesoy, a
      doctoral student at the University of Washington.<br>
      <br>
      The peptide-enabled technology allows the deposition of 10 to 50
      micrometers of new enamel on the teeth after each use...<br>
      <br>
      “Remineralization guided by peptides is a healthy alternative to
      current dental health care,” said study’s lead author Professor
      Mehmet Sarikaya, from the Department of Chemical Engineering and
      the Department of Oral Health Sciences at the University of
      Washington...<br>

          Peptide Enables In Vitro Remineralization of Human Enamel. </b><br>

      White spot lesions (WSL) and incipient caries on enamel surfaces
      are the earliest clinical outcomes for demineralization and
      caries. If left untreated, the caries can progress and may cause
      complex restorative procedures or even tooth extraction which
      destroys soft and hard tissue architecture as a consequence of
      connective tissue and bone loss. Current clinical practices are
      insufficient in treating dental caries. A long-standing practical
      challenge associated with demineralization related to dental
      diseases is incorporating a functional mineral microlayer which is
      fully integrated into the molecular structure of the tooth in
      repairing damaged enamel. This study demonstrates that small
      peptide domains derived from native protein amelogenin can be
      utilized to construct a mineral layer on damaged human enamel in
      vitro. Six groups were prepared to carry out remineralization on
      artificially created lesions on enamel: (1) no treatment, (2) Ca2+
      and PO43– only, (3) 1100 ppm fluoride (F), (4) 20?000 ppm F, (5)
      1100 ppm F and peptide, and (6) peptide alone. While the 1100 ppm
      F sample (indicative of common F content of toothpaste for
      homecare) did not deliver F to the thinly deposited mineral layer,
      high F test sample (indicative of clinical varnish treatment)
      formed mainly CaF2 nanoparticles on the surface. Fluoride,
      however, was deposited in the presence of the peptide, which also
      formed a thin mineral layer which was partially crystallized as
      fluorapatite. Among the test groups, only the peptide-alone sample
      resulted in remineralization of fairly thick (10 µm) dense
      mineralized layer containing HAp mineral, resembling the structure
      of the healthy enamel. The newly formed mineralized layer
      exhibited integration with the underlying enamel as evident by
      cross-sectional imaging. The peptide-guided remineralization
      approach sets the foundation for future development of biomimetic
      products and treatments for dental health care.<br>

      <b> </b><b>Inventor(s):&nbsp; SARIKAYA et al.</b><br>
      <b> </b><br>
      <b> </b>Reagents and methods for whitening and remineralizing
      teeth using biomineralizing peptides are described.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b> BACKGROUND</b><br>
      <br>
      Accumulation of various chromogcns/discolorants, for example, food
      and tobacco that come into contact daily onto tooth surfaces and
      their subsequent penetration into deeper regions (dentin), cause
      tooth discoloration. Furthermore, the process of aging, disease,
      trauma, certain medications, certain congenital conditions, and
      environmental effects can also cause teeth to become discolored.
      Although discolored teeth do not cause health problems, since
      bright white teem arc usually considered to be cosmetically
      desirable, there is a great deal of interest in developing
      compositions and methods for whitening teeth.<br>
      <br>
      There arc several techniques for whitening or bleaching of teeth.
      Professional whitening methods, also known as "in-clinic"
      whitening strategics, arc considered presently as the most
      effective methods. These in-clinic whitening strategies typically
      involve the application of high-concentration peroxide products
      (up to 35%) and other abrasive chemicals to the discolored area.
      These peroxide species penetrate the stained area (up to
      underlying dentin layer) and dissolve the accumulated discoloring
      agents through an oxidation process. To achieve desired effects
      more quickly, such oxidation reactions on teeth arc often assisted
      with external laser light application, which heats up the reaction
      site and thereby increases the rate oxidation reaction.
      Furthermore, utilization of titanium dioxide up to 10% is often
      preferred to facilitate these photo- catalytic reactions. Other
      in-clinic whitening techniques involve superficially removing the
      enamel layer with abrasive instruments or pumice followed by
      treatment with additional caustic agents.<br>
      <br>
      There arc several drawbacks of these in-clinic techniques. First
      of all, the abrasive chemicals and peroxide agents causes enamel
      demoralization and results with teeth sensitivity. In most cases
      sorc/injurcd gums as well as bad taste of the product itself cause
      much discomfort to the patients. Further, patients arc required to
      make a clinic appointment to get this medical service.<br>
      <br>
      Other existing products for at-home use contain considerably lower
      concentrations of active oxidizing agents and, thus, arc generally
      less effective than in- clinic whitening strategics and products.
      Therefore, dramatic whitening effect can only be achieved by the
      repeated applications of these reagents for several weeks. These
      treatments often assisted with bleaching trays (night-guard) in
      order to better localize bleaching products and, thereby, maximize
      the whitening effect However, even though these at home products
      contain active whitening agents in lower concentrations, similar
      side effects as those associated with professional treatments arc
      very common. In addition, there arc paint-on, at-home whitening
      products, also known as "tooth varnishes", as well as whitening
      strips intended to eliminate the need for dental trays. However,
      these products require more frequent applications, usually 3-timcs
      in a day, to complete whitening procedure. Finally, among the
      variety of at-home use products, whitening toothpastes and gels
      are the least effective form of whitening products due to their
      short contact time with the tooth surfaces. Although bleaching
      agent additives augment the effectiveness, the whitening effect is
      primarily as a result of removal of surface stains via mechanical
      action of brushing and other polishing ingredients (for example,
      silica particles).<br>
      <br>
      Dental caries is one of the major public health problems and it is
      a highly prevalent disease among the global population. Incipient
      caries and white spot lesions (WSL) as well as hypersensitivity,
      arc the earliest clinical evidence of enamel dcmincralization and
      dental caries. Dental caries occurs when tooth enamel is exposed
      to acid produced by cariogenic bacteria. As a result, acid
      diffuses into surface enamel and dissolves hydroxyapatite (HAp)
      mineral. Due to its non-rcgenerative nature, enamel is unable to
      heal and repair itself post-dcmincralization. Traditionally,
      fluoride (F) has been used as the key agent in prevention of
      caries. Fluoride functions primarily via topical mechanisms. It is
      believed that fluoride forms a thin layer of new but harder
      mineral, namely fluorapatitc (FAp) which is incorporated into the
      existing HAp mineral on the tooth surface. There is a trend of
      enhancing the rcmincralization effect of fluoride with calcium and
      phosphate supplementation in high risk individuals. Although
      controversial, the use of fluoride products remains the primary
      treatment modality for caries prevention and rcmincralization,
      with major limitations regarding the efficacy of these products
      for the reversal or prevention of dental caries. Fluoride delivery
      systems, therefore, arc not sufficient to overcome the high caries
      risk especially in younger and elderly population.<br>
      <br>
      There is presently an unmet need for tooth whitening and
      mineralization methods and products that reduce or eliminate the
      need for concentrated, abrasive oxidizing agents and attendant
      side effects such as dcmincralization-associatcd tooth sensitivity
      and gum line injuries.<br>
