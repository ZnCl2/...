        <p>Like many backyard inventors, Dan Lightfoot of Sigourney,
          Iowa has been interested in alternate energy concepts for some
          time about 22 years, as a matter of fact. Unlike most of his
          peers, however, Dan has managed to make a major breakthrough
          in his field -- one which even has the "experts" shaking their
          heads in disbelief. </p>
        <p>That breakthrough is the Hot-Line solar collector you see
          pictured in the Image Gallery. At first glance, the Hot-Line
          module looks just about like a conventional flat-plate
          collector. What makes Lightfoot's panel highly unconventional
          is that it [1]<span style="font-weight: bold;"> contains a
            specially curved reflector which acts to concentrate
            incoming sunlight on a wedge-shaped absorption tube, [2]
            operates with an efficiency far surpassing that of any
            "normal" flat-plate solar panel, and [3] actually "tracks"
            the sun through a 50 degree "vertical arc” and through 150
            degrees in the "east/west plane” without moving! </span></p>
        <p>Impossible? That's what a University of Iowa physics
          professor said when Dan Lightfoot first explained the design
          to him. Rest assured, though, the device does work, and rather
          well, at that. </p>
        <p>So well, in fact, that Lightfoot (after selling exclusive
          manufacturing rights on his invention to the Iowa City-based
          NRG Corporation) has recently been able to quit his job with a
          mining firm and devote full time to energy research. Lightfoot
          now heads up an outfit called Aerco, which is short for
          Alternate Energy Resources Company. </p>
        <p>Dan Lightfoot came upon the idea for the Hot-Line collector
          quite by accident a decade ago. It seems Dan had been
          observing a sheet of aluminum that was resting up against his
          garage wall and noticed how the sun's reflection from that
          curved sheet formed a bright spot on an adjoining wall.
          Moreover, he noticed that the bright spot stayed in roughly
          the same place throughout the day, despite the sun's constant
          movement. </p>
        <p>This got Dan to thinking, and to experimenting. With the aid
          of a small sheet of aluminum, a few scraps of wood and a
          handful of bolts and clamps, Lightfoot found (by trial and
          error) that he could curve the metal in such a way that it
          would focus light in a line -- a line that, furthermore, moved
          only a small distance in or out from the metal as the
          jury-rigged reflector was tilted through various angles to the
          sun. </p>
        <p>At this point, Dan knew that if he could just bend a long
          sheet of reflective material to the same curvature, lay a
          channel along the focal plane of the reflector thus created,
          and run air or water through that channel, he'd have what no
          one had developed before: a fixed-position, concentrating
          solar collector. (Focusing collectors are nothing new, of
          course, but they all have one drawback: in order to work, the
          reflector must face squarely into the sun at all times. This
          usually calls, in turn, for a costly and complex motorized
          gimbal mounting, to allow tracking of the sun. In contrast, <span
            style="font-weight: bold;">Lightfoot's collector can focus
            light all day long while remaining stationary</span> -- a
          "major breakthrough" indeed!) </p>
        <p>So, in his spare time, Dan built models and refined them over
          a period of years until he felt he had optimized all aspects
          of the unorthodox solar panel's design. The end result was the
          Hot-Line solar collector. </p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Measuring 26 1/2-by-96-by-10
          inches, the production version of the Hot-Line module has a
          surface area of 16.1 square feet. Nestled in the unit's sturdy
          aluminum frame or chassis (see Fig. 1 above) is a pre-shaped
          block of styrofoam which serves to [1] insulate the structure
          and [2] hold the reflector â€” a sheet of mirror-finish
          aluminum -- ” in the proper curvature. Laid along the deepest
          part of the reflector's curve is the triangular-section
          aluminum absorption tube. (The wedge shape is necessary in
          order to accommodate the lengthening and shortening of focal
          lengths as light enters the panel at different angles.)
          Finally, covering the surface of the panel is a sheet of
          Kalwall Sun-Lite fiberglass glazing, which Lightfoot claims
          "deflects very little incoming sunlight, even at oblique
          angles." </p>
        <p>How does the Hot-Line collector work? As you can see in Fig.
          2 (see Image Gallery), when sunlight enters the panel at a
          nearly perpendicular angle (such as would occur around
          sunrise) the reflector focuses incoming rays of light either
          on the outermost edge of the absorption tube or the part
          closest to the reflector itself, depending on whether the
          incident light enters the collector's upper portion or lower
          portion. As Ole Sol rises higher in the sky, the focal line,
          or "hot line," hitting the top surface of the absorption wedge
          moves closer to the reflector --"while the hot line on the
          aluminum extrusion's underside moves away from the reflector
          sheeting. Not until the sun is more than 60 degrees above the
          horizon, or better than 75 degrees displaced to the east or
          west, does the incoming light fail to focus or become "blanked
          out" by the chassis itself. </p>
        <p>What this means in the case of a vertically mounted,
          south-facing unit is: the Hot-Line collector [A] starts
          working as soon as the morning sun peeks over the horizon, [B]
          continues to concentrate light energy all day until the sun
          rises more than 60 degrees (that is, a good deal more than its
          maximum winter height) above the horizon, and [C] does so at
          continuously high efficiency. (At the moment, Dan Lightfoot is
          not advertising any particular set of numbers when it comes to
          the efficiency of his collector, but preliminary tests by
          others in the field point to<span style="font-weight: bold;">
            heat-recovery percentages in the very high 80s or low 90s</span>
          -- which is about double the efficiency of most commercial
          flat-plate collectors.) </p>
        <p>Thus, it's easy to believe Dan Lightfoot when he confidently
          states that just one of his 16-square-foot Hot-Line panels is
          sufficient to provide total daytime heating for one room in an
          average house. "Some rooms heat up more than others,"
          Lightfoot explains, "depending on the degree of insulation,
          volume of air to be heated, and so on. However, you might like
          to know that one fellow in Kaloma, Iowa heats a room with a
          single Hot-Line module, and that room doesn't have any
          insulation or even any wallboard! Still, the 140-degreeÂ air
          coming out of that collector warms the place right up." </p>
        <p>So far, Aerco and NRG have installed a total of 18 Hot-line
          units in Iowa, all of them air-heating (as opposed to
          water-heating) models. That is, in each of these installations
          a blower is used to force room air through the collector's
          absorption tube and straight back again into the room, without
          "tapping into" a heat storage reservoir at any point. (A water
          system employing heat storage is, however, under development
          at present and will be on the market soon.) </p>
        <p>How does Dan Lightfoot like spending all of his time (and
          most of his cash reserves) on energy research, after giving
          decades of his adult life to a career in the coal-mining
          industry? "I'm happier doing what I'm doing now,” trying to
          wake people up to the possibilities of alternative energy
          sources,” than I've ever been," he proclaims. "I wouldn't
          trade the satisfaction I'm receiving now for anything in the
          world!"</p>

      <p style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract <br>
      </p>
      <p>A solar heat system is comprised of a panel or bank of heat
        collector modules each of which has a fluid-carrying tube of an
        elongated triangular shape in transverse cross section formed
        with longitudinally extended inwardly projected heat radiating
        fins. A tube is mounted within a concavo-convex reflector of a
        hyperbolic form such that the side walls of the tube are
        subjected to reflected rays of solar radiation over an effective
        range of solar exposure of about one hundred and fifty (150°)
        degrees. <br>
      </p>
      <p>The reflected rays are concentrated in a longitudinally
        extended focal zone on each side wall of the tube and these
        zones of concentrated solar radiation move transversely of a
        side wall in response to the angle of the solar rays falling
        upon the reflector.<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></p>
