      </center>
      <p>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- In a step toward creating energy from
        sunlight as plants do, MIT researchers have invented a compound
        that produces hydrogen gas with the help of a catalyst and a zap
        of light. </p>
      <p>The researchers, Professor Daniel G. Nocera of chemistry and
        former MIT graduate student Alan F. Heyduk, reported their
        discovery in the August 31 issue of Science. Creating a molecule
        to replace a leaf -- essentially, photosynthesis in a beaker --
        could provide a cheap, clean future energy source, Professor
        Nocera said. </p>
      <p>"We have been seeking a future alternative fuel source by
        studying the principles that govern the conversion of photon
        energy into chemical potential," he said. "Our strategy is to
        use the energy of sunlight to drive reactants uphill to
        energy-rich products, thus harnessing the sun's energy to create
        a renewable energy source in the future." </p>
      <p><b>Splitting chemical bonds</b> </p>
      <p>Nocera and Heyduk created a compound based on the metal
        rhodium. When the rhodium photocatalyst is dissolved in
        solution, the researchers add to it a hydrogen-containing acid
        (also called a hydrohalic acid -- one example is hydrochloric
        acid), and shine light on it. </p>
      <p>"In the leaf, sugar and oxygen are energy-rich products. In our
        beaker, the sought-after fuels are hydrogen and a halogen,
        produced catalytically from the photochemical splitting of
        hydrohalic acid," Nocera said. </p>
      <p>The structure of the rhodium compound allows it to break the
        hydrohalic acid's chemical bonds. Hydrogen gas, with a byproduct
        of bromides and chlorides, is produced. The by-products are
        chemically trapped and recycled into the reaction. </p>
      <p>While not as complete and efficient as photosynthesis, this
        system comes close to the ideal use of a molecular catalyst as
        part of a homogeneous reaction for which scientists have been
        searching for more than three decades. </p>
      <p><b>Plant power</b> </p>
      <p>The African violet on your windowsill converts sunlight into a
        high-energy fuel over and over again in a process so complicated
        that scientists have yet to come close to duplicating it.
        Attempts to mimic it so far have not produced an energy
        conversion process efficient enough to compete with fossil
        fuels. </p>
      <p>However, future generations will require alternatives to
        limited petroleum-based fuels. If scientists can make hydrogen,
        it could combine with the oxygen in the air to make water. This
        is the process that fuel cells use to generate energy. Within
        fuel cells, which are now being produced by various
        manufacturers for vehicles and buildings, it would take a
        photocatalyst and solar energy to start the reaction all over
        again from water. </p>
      <p>In the work reported in Science, the MIT researchers' goal was
        to trap the photon energy in a structurally well-defined
        molecule and control the subsequent reactions to convert light
        into hydrogen. Previously, the closest scientists have come to
        achieving this goal is to use photocatalysts that are solids,
        which need massive surface areas. </p>
      <p>In a chemical reaction, the trick is to design a system where
        the energy needed to break a chemical bond is compensated by the
        absorption of a photon. The payoff: an alternative, clean fuel
        source produced with the help of sunlight. </p>
      <p>"Heyduk and Nocera have taken fundamental ideas of
        photochemistry and harnessed them to achieve a long sought-after
        but elusive goal: molecular-based photocatalytic production of a
        useable fuel," writes James K. McCusker, a chemistry professor
        at Michigan State University, in a perspective for Science. "The
        importance of this work is not the specificity of the catalyst's
        performance, but rather that a new door has been opened." <br>
        Putting sunlight to work </p>
      <p>Sunlight is the perfect energy source -- readily available and
        free. According to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory of
        Golden, Colo., the sun bathes us every day with more energy than
        humans could use in 30 years. </p>
      <p>Nocera says that their new process is not perfect, but it is a
        beginning that may re-ignite solar energy research that has been
        largely dormant since the 1970s. </p>
      <p>"As it stands, we have performed half of the photosynthetic
        reaction by generating hydrogen. If we can now get the other
        half of the process to work (getting the halogen), we would have
        a framework for future energy production," Nocera said. </p>
      <p>This work is supported by the National Science Foundation. </p>

      <p>In a revolutionary leap that could transform solar power from a
        marginal, boutique alternative into a mainstream energy source,
        MIT researchers have overcome a major barrier to large-scale
        solar power: storing energy for use when the sun doesn't shine.
      </p>
      <p>Until now, solar power has been a daytime-only energy source,
        because storing extra solar energy for later use is
        prohibitively expensive and grossly inefficient. With today's
        announcement, MIT researchers have hit upon a simple,
        inexpensive, highly efficient process for storing solar energy.
      </p>
      <p>Requiring nothing but abundant, non-toxic natural materials,
        this discovery could unlock the most potent, carbon-free energy
        source of all: the sun. "This is the nirvana of what we've been
        talking about for years," said MIT's Daniel Nocera, the Henry
        Dreyfus Professor of Energy at MIT and senior author of a paper
        describing the work in the July 31 issue of Science. "Solar
        power has always been a limited, far-off solution. Now we can
        seriously think about solar power as unlimited and soon." </p>
      <p>Inspired by the photosynthesis performed by plants, Nocera and
        Matthew Kanan, a postdoctoral fellow in Nocera's lab, have
        developed an unprecedented process that will allow the sun's
        energy to be used to split water into hydrogen and oxygen gases.
        Later, the oxygen and hydrogen may be recombined inside a fuel
        cell, creating carbon-free electricity to power your house or
        your electric car, day or night. </p>
      <p>The key component in Nocera and Kanan's new process is a new
        catalyst that produces oxygen gas from water; another catalyst
        produces valuable hydrogen gas. The new catalyst consists of
        cobalt metal, phosphate and an electrode, placed in water. When
        electricity -- whether from a photovoltaic cell, a wind turbine
        or any other source -- runs through the electrode, the cobalt
        and phosphate form a thin film on the electrode, and oxygen gas
        is produced. </p>
      <p>Combined with another catalyst, such as platinum, that can
        produce hydrogen gas from water, the system can duplicate the
        water splitting reaction that occurs during photosynthesis. </p>
      <p>The new catalyst works at room temperature, in neutral pH
        water, and it's easy to set up, Nocera said. "That's why I know
        this is going to work. It's so easy to implement," he said. <br>
        'Giant leap' for clean energy </p>
      <p>Sunlight has the greatest potential of any power source to
        solve the world's energy problems, said Nocera. In one hour,
        enough sunlight strikes the Earth to provide the entire planet's
        energy needs for one year. </p>
      <p>James Barber, a leader in the study of photosynthesis who was
        not involved in this research, called the discovery by Nocera
        and Kanan a "giant leap" toward generating clean, carbon-free
        energy on a massive scale. </p>
      <p>"This is a major discovery with enormous implications for the
        future prosperity of humankind," said Barber, the Ernst Chain
        Professor of Biochemistry at Imperial College London. "The
        importance of their discovery cannot be overstated since it
        opens up the door for developing new technologies for energy
        production thus reducing our dependence for fossil fuels and
        addressing the global climate change problem." <br>
        'Just the beginning' </p>
      <p>Currently available electrolyzers, which split water with
        electricity and are often used industrially, are not suited for
        artificial photosynthesis because they are very expensive and
        require a highly basic (non-benign) environment that has little
        to do with the conditions under which photosynthesis operates. </p>
      <p>More engineering work needs to be done to integrate the new
        scientific discovery into existing photovoltaic systems, but
        Nocera said he is confident that such systems will become a
        reality. </p>
      <p>"This is just the beginning," said Nocera, principal
        investigator for the Solar Revolution Project funded by the
        Chesonis Family Foundation and co-Director of the Eni-MIT Solar
        Frontiers Center. "The scientific community is really going to
        run with this." </p>
      <p>Nocera hopes that within 10 years, homeowners will be able to
        power their homes in daylight through photovoltaic cells, while
        using excess solar energy to produce hydrogen and oxygen to
        power their own household fuel cell. Electricity-by-wire from a
        central source could be a thing of the past. </p>
      <p>The project is part of the MIT Energy Initiative, a program
        designed to help transform the global energy system to meet the
        needs of the future and to help build a bridge to that future by
        improving today's energy systems. MITEI Director Ernest Moniz,
        Cecil and Ida Green Professor of Physics and Engineering
        Systems, noted that "this discovery in the Nocera lab
        demonstrates that moving up the transformation of our energy
        supply system to one based on renewables will depend heavily on
        frontier basic science." </p>
      <p>The success of the Nocera lab shows the impact of a mixture of
        funding sources - governments, philanthropy, and industry. This
        project was funded by the National Science Foundation and by the
        Chesonis Family Foundation, which gave MIT $10 million this
        spring to launch the Solar Revolution Project, with a goal to
        make the large scale deployment of solar energy within 10 years.

      <p>MIT professor Daniel G. Nocera has long been jealous of plants.
        He desperately wanted to do what they do -- split water into
        hydrogen and oxygen and use the products to do work. That, he
        figures, is the only way we humans can solve our energy
        problems; enough energy pours down from the sun in one hour to
        power the planet's energy needs for a year. </p>
      <p>In January, only a month after reevaluating his methodology in
        the face of a frustratingly slow process, he finally found a
        way. "For six months now I've been looking at the leaves and
        saying 'I own you guys!'" </p>
      <p>Nocera's discovery -- a cheap and easy way to store energy that
        he thinks will be used to change solar power into a mainstream
        energy source -- will be published in the journal Science on
        Friday. "This is the nirvana of what we've been talking about
        for years," said Nocera, the Henry Dreyfus Professor of Energy
        at MIT. "Solar power has always been a limited, far-off
        solution. Now we can seriously think about solar power as
        unlimited--and soon." </p>
      <p>Plants catch light and turn it into an electric current, then
        use that energy to excite catalysts that split water into
        hydrogen and oxygen during what is called photosynthesis' light
        cycle. The energy is then used during the dark cycle to allow
        the plant to build sugars used for growth and energy storage. </p>
      <p>Nocera and Matthew Kanan, a postdoctoral fellow in Nocera's
        lab, focused on the water-splitting part of photosynthesis. They
        found cheap and simple catalysts that did a remarkably good job.
        They dissolved cobalt and phosphate in water and then zapped it
        with electricity through an electrode. The cobalt and phosphate
        form a thin-film catalyst around the electrode that then use
        electrons from the electrode to split the oxygen from water. The
        oxygen bubbles to the surface, leaving a proton behind. </p>
      <p>A few inches away, another catalyst, platinum, helps that bare
        proton become hydrogen. (This second reaction is a well-known
        one, and not part of Nocera and Kanan's study.) </p>
      <p>The hydrogen and oxygen, separated and on-hand, can be used to
        power a fuel cell whenever energy is needed. </p>
      <p>"Once you put a photovoltaic on it," he says, "you've got an
        inorganic leaf." </p>
      <p>James Barber, a biochemistry professor at Imperial College
        London who studies artificial photosynthesis but was not
        involved in this research, called the discovery by Nocera and
        Kanan a "giant leap" toward generating clean, carbon-free energy
        on a massive scale. </p>
      <p>"This is a major discovery with enormous implications for the
        future prosperity of humankind," he said. "The importance of
        their discovery cannot be overstated." </p>
      <p>Nocera's discovery arose from frustration. Disappointed with
        the pace of his lab's progress, Nocera and his team decided in
        December to question some of the basic assumptions they had made
        in setting up earlier experiments. </p>
      <p>Chemists, it turns out, are always worrying about the stability
        of their catalysts and end up doing backflips to try to
        synthesize materials that won't corrode. Photosynthesis, though,
        is so violently reactive that the catalysts involved break down
        every 30 minutes. The leaf has to constantly rebuild them.
        Maybe, thought Nocera, instead of fighting corrosion, he should
        work with it. "It's a bias a lot of scientists have. We want
        something to be structurally stable. But all it has to be is
        functionally stable." </p>
      <p>This thinking led Nocera to try his cobalt-phosphate mixture.
        He knew it wouldn't hold together, but he thought it might still
        work. Sure enough, Nocera's catalyst breaks down whenever the
        electricity is cut, but it assembles itself again when
        electricity is reapplied. </p>
      <p>Nocera's discovery is still a science experiment. It needs
        plenty of engineering before it can be a useful device. The
        cobalt and phosphate at the center of Nocera's work is cheap and
        plentiful, but the hydrogen reaction uses platinum, which is
        rare and expensive. The electrode needs to be improved so the
        oxygen-making process can speed up. And the system needs to be
        integrated into some kind of electricity-producing device,
        ideally powered by solar or wind on one end and a fuel cell on
        the other. </p>
      <p>But splitting the oxygen away from the water was the hard part,
        and Nocera has done it. "Now we can start thinking about a
        totally distributed solar [photovoltaic] system," he said. "We
        couldn't have a solar economy unless it could produce energy
        24/7. Now we can." </p>
      <p>His hope is that because unlike traditional electrolysis
        devices, which are expensive and require toxic alkaline
        solutions, his system is so cheap, simple and benign that
        scientists and engineers around the world will be able to
        improve it quickly. </p>
      <p>For his part, Nocera says he will work to understand and
        improve both sides of his new discovery. His lab will try to
        learn every detail about just how his catalyst is making the
        oxygen. And he is going to work with his engineering colleagues
        at MIT to try to integrate his storage device into systems that
        he hopes one day will power homes and cars all day and all
        night. </p>

        <p><b>TECHNICAL FIELD</b> </p>
        <p>Embodiments of the present invention relate to photocatalytic
          chemical processes. Embodiments of the present invention
          relate to the production of hydrogen from a hydrohalic acid
          solution using a homogenous photocatalyst. Embodiments of the
          present invention also include novel two-electron
          mixed-valence complexes. </p>
        <p><b>DESCRIPTION</b> </p>
        <p>Photocatalytic production of chemical products offers an
          inexpensive method of driving a chemical reaction toward the
          production of molecules comprising more energy than the raw
          materials. Photocatalysts having excitation energies that fall
          within the spectrum of solar radiation at the surface of earth
          are of particular interest. The potential of solar chemistry
          in the generation of energy-rich molecules from inexpensive
          energy-poor raw materials has been extensively researched.
          Embodiments of the present invention comprise transition metal
          complexes capable of mediating multielectron transformations.
          These multielectron transformations allow activation of small
          molecules. Embodiments of the present invention comprise
          catalysts with a multinuclear core transition metal complex in
          a two electron mixed valence state. The two-electron
          mixed-valence state may mediate chemical processes, such as
          atom transfer, bond activation, and substrate
          functionalization, for example. </p>
        <p>The multicore transition metal complexes may be stabilized by
          the chemical composition of the ligands coordinated with the
          multinuclear transition metal core. For example, the
          electronic and steric properties of bridging
          bis(phosphine)amine ligands favor disproportionation of
          valence-symmetric binuclear cores. Such properties in the
          bis(difluorophosphine)methyl amine ("dfpma") ligand stabilizes
          Rh.sup.0 --Rh.sup.II cores. The disproportionation of
          embodiments of the present invention include new ligands to
          stabilize two-electron mixed-valence complexes were developed
          by manipulation of the stereo-electronic effects engendered by
          phosphine and nitrogen functionalization. </p>
        <p>An embodiment of the present invention is a process having a
          reaction medium comprising a protic solution, a photocatalyst
          capable of a two-electron reduction of hydrogen ions, and a
          coproduct trap. The reaction medium may be exposed to
          radiation capable of photoexciting the photocatalyst to
          produce hydrogen. The reaction medium may comprise any protic
          solution, such as a hydrohalic acid of hydrochloric acid,
          hydrogen bromide, hydrogen fluoride, and hydrogen iodide. A
          coproduct is any compound or atom produced other than the
          desired product, for example, the desired product may be
          hydrogen. A coproduct trap is any material, such as an atom or
          chemical compound, which may attach, react or bind with the
          coproduct to prevent the coproduct from interfering with the
          desired reaction. For example, the coproduct trap may be a
          compound capable of bonding with a halogen atom, such as, for
          example, tetrahydrofuran, dihydroanthracene, a silane,
          isopropanal and 2,3 dimethylbutadiene. </p>
        <p>The photocatalyst of the present invention may be any
          photocatalyst capable of a two electron reduction of hydrogen
          ions and comprises a multinuclear transition metal core. An
          embodiment of the photocatalyst of the present invention is a
          multinuclear transition metal core which is capable of a two
          electron reduction of hydrogen atoms. The photocatalyst may
          also comprise a ligand that is capable of stabilizing a
          two-electron mixed-valence state of the binuclear transition
          metal core. </p>
        <p>A further embodiment of the present invention includes a
          reaction medium comprising a protic solution; a photocatalyst
          comprising a binuclear transition metal complex and a ligand
          capable of supporting the photocatalyst in a two-electron
          mixed-valence state; and a coproduct trap. The photocatalyst
          may then be photoexcited to produce hydrogen from the reaction
          medium. The ligand may be, for example, a diphosphazane ligand
          or a ligand having a strongly .PI.-acidic phosphine group. </p>
        <p>Another embodiment of the present invention comprises a
          process involving exciting at least two photocatalysts to an
          active state wherein the photocatalysts comprise two rhodium
          atoms; contacting the photocatalysts with hydrogen ions and
          halogen ions of a hydrohalic acid solution, thereby producing
          hydrogen and a photocatalyst in a mixed valence state
          comprising halogen atoms; and irradiating the photocatalyst in
          a mixed valence state to eliminate at least a portion of the
          halogen atoms. The embodiment may include a hydrogen ion and a
          halogen ion binding to the photocatalysts prior to reacting to
          produce hydrogen and an unidentified photocatalytic
          intermediate. It is theorized that the photocataltic
          intermediate reacts with additional hydrogen ions and halogen
          ions to form a photocatalyst comprising four halogen atoms and
          additional hydrogen. The process may then be continued by
          further radiation of the photocatalyst to eliminate the
          halogen atoms and absorbing the halogen atoms in a
          halogen-atom trap. Preferably, the photocatalyst is excited by
          irradiation with sunlight. </p>
        <p>An additional embodiment of the present invention includes a
          compound comprising two iridium atoms, wherein the iridium
          atoms are in a two-electron mixed-valence state, and at least
          one ligand. The iridium compound may be stabilized by at least
          one ligand, such as, for example, a diphosphazane ligand. </p>

        <p><b>CHARACTERIZATION OF LIGAND EFFECTS ON BINUCLEAR CORES</b>
        </p>
        <p>Research in inorganic chemistry includes preparation of new
          molecules to mediate multi-electron transformations. Such
          transformations assist in the activation of small molecules
          and allow more controlled reactivity of small molecules.
          Excited-state valence disproportionation of symmetric
          quadruply-bonded dimers may be observed by transient
          spectroscopic techniques. The present inventors developed
          complexes in which two-electron mixed valency could be
          incorporated into ground state configurations of the
          transition metal complexes. </p>
        <p>Preparation of two-electron mixed-valence compounds is
          accomplished through the internal disproportionation of
          valence symmetric metal complexes. The inventors envisioned
          three different approaches to internal disproportionation,
          depicted in Scheme 1, were envisioned to effect this reaction
          and determine ligands which are capable of stabilizing a two
          electron mixed valence state of a multinuclear transition
          metal core, and more specifically a binuclear transition metal
          core. In Case I of Scheme 1, an asymmetric ligand is
          constructed from disparate electron withdrawing and electron
          donating fragments. In such a case, the electron-withdrawing
          group may stabilize low-valent metal centers whereas the
          electron-donating group may stabilize high-valent metal
          centers such as an oxypiridinate ligand. Synthetically,
          disporoportionation by the method of Case I is challenging for
          at least two reasons. General strategies for the preparation
          of simple asymmetric bridging ligands utilize a complex
          multi-step procedure. Secondly, it is difficult to control the
          linkage isomerism of ligands that possess inherent asymmetry
          such as oxypyridinate ligands. Typically, two asymmetric
          ligands add to a binuclear metal core in a head-to-tail
          fashion, ##STR1## </p>
        <p>yielding a net symmetric electronic environment. </p>
        <p>Preparation of two-electron mixed-valence complexes may also
          be accomplished by induced asymmetry of the bridging ligand
          framework. See Cases II and III in Scheme 1. A bridging ligand
          between the metal centers may be used to create an induced
          asymmetric environment suitable for late transition metals.
          For example, a three atom bridging ligand, with .pi.-acid
          groups to coordinate the metal centers and a Lewis-basic
          bridgehead atom, may induce an asymmetric environment via
          directional lone pair donation from the bridgehead atom to one
          .pi.-acid group. In another embodiment, a ligand composed of
          hard .pi.-donating coordination groups and a Lewis .pi.-acidic
          bridgehead atom may lead to valence disproportionation in
          high-valent early transition metal complexes. Embodiments of
          the present invention may comprise any ligand capable of
          stabilizing a mixed valence state in the binuclear transition
          metal core. An embodiment of the present invention of a Case
          II ligand may be a ligand of the formula, RN(PY.sub.2).sub.2,
          wherein the ligand comprises a phosphazane group, P--N--P. The
          Y groups may be independently selected and may be any
          combination of groups which give at least one phosphorous atom
          of the phosphazane group strong .pi.-acid characteristics,
          preferably both phosphorous atoms have strong .pi.-acid
          characteristics. The Y groups may not all be identical atoms
          or groups and all the Y's need not contribute to the
          .pi.-acidity of the coordinating atoms. The Y group may be,
          for example, but not limited to, at least one of halogen,
          fluorine, chlorine, halogenated alkanes, halogenated alkenes,
          aryl substituted with electron withdrawing groups, and
          alcohols. The ligands have strong .pi.-acid characteristics,
          if at least a portion of the transition metal complexes are
          present in the two electron mixed valence state. As the
          strength of the .pi.-acidity of the attached ligands of
          binuclear transition metal complexes increase, the complexes
          will form an equilibrium wherein at least a portion of the
          complexes will exist in the two electron mixed valence state.
          These complexes will be photocatalytically active in the
          present invention. As the pi-acidity of the ligands increases
          the equilibrium of the complexes will shift toward a state in
          which all of the complexes are in the two electron mixed
          valence state. Additionally, the Figures and the Examples use
          three ligands to stabilize the mixed valence state of the
          photocatalyst, however, it is contemplated that a single
          ligand may be prepared comprising the characteristics
          necessary to stabilize the mixed valence state. The single
          ligand may be, for example, a multidentate ligand which
          comprises the electronic and steric properties described
          above. Such as, for example, the ligands described herein
          connected through the R group. </p>
        <p>The R attached to a nitrogen atom of the phosphazane group
          may be any atom or group which allows participation of a lone
          pair of electrons to participate in .pi.-bonding with the
          phosporus atoms. The R attached to a nitrogen atom may be, for
          example, but not limited to, a substituted or unsubstituted
          C.sub.1 -C.sub.10 alkyl groups, methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl,
          pentyl, hydrogen and a substituted phenyl, wherein the alkyl
          group may be a branched or an unbranched alkyl group. </p>
        <p>A Case II ligand may be prepared by the reaction of PCl.sub.3
          with primary amines which leads to the formation of a
          bis(dichlorophosphine)amine fragment as shown in Scheme 2.
          This reaction has been observed for a variety of starting
          materials, ##STR2## </p>
        <p>including simple alkyl amines and substituted aniline
          derivatives. Reaction with Grignard and alkyl lithium reagents
          affords alkyl phosphines; rapid reaction with alcohols in the
          presence of tertiary amine bases gives the corresponding
          phosphite derivatives. Finally, metathesis with antimony
          trifluoride provides a high-yield route to the
          bis(difluorophosphine)amine derivative, which possess more
          .pi.-acidic phosphines of the PNP-type ligands. These
          synthetic routes are versatile. Electronic and steric
          parameters of the ligand can be finely manipulated by
          functionalization at both the nitrogen and phosphorus centers.
        </p>
        <p>The ligands as described above may be used to stabilize
          internal disproportionation on any binuclear transition metal
          transition metal complex. The core may comprise different
          transition metals. The transition metals comprising the
          binuclear core may be independently selected from, for
          example, Rh, Ir, Cu, Fe, Ru, Cr, Mo, W, Co, Re, No, Mn, V, Nb,
          Ta, Zn, Au, Pd, Pt and Ag. </p>
        <p>The chemistry of dfpma with Group VI metals was determined
          shortly after its preparation. Three ligands were observed to
          span d.sup.9 --d.sup.9 metal cores, as observed for
          Co.sub.2.sup.0,0 (dfpma).sub.3 (CO).sub.2. UV-irradiation of
          this complex in alkane solutions containing phosphine ligands
          leads to carbonyl loss and coordination of the phosphine in
          the axial site. An extensive redox chemistry was explored for
          Co.sub.2.sup.0,0 (dfpma).sub.3 (CO).sub.2. For example,
          oxidation with Br.sub.2 gave a four electron oxidized species,
          Co.sub.2.sup.II,II (dfpma).sub.3 Br.sub.4, whereas
          electrochemical reduction gave a two-electron reduced anionic
          complex, [Co.sub.2.sup.-I,-I (dfpma).sub.3 (CO).sub.2 ]. </p>
        <p>An embodiment of the present invention may also comprise a
          Case III ligand. A nonlimiting example of a Case III ligand is
          one of the formula, RN(BY.sub.1), wherein the R is as
          described above and the Y.sub.1 may be independently selected
          and may be any atom or group which contributes to hard
          .pi.-donating characteristic of the coordination groups.
          Embodiments of the present invention may comprise any ligand
          capable of causing internal disproportionation of the
          multinuclear core and capable of stabilizing a mixed valence
          state. </p>

        <p>To extend the two-electron mixed-valence chemistry of these
          ligands, the steric and electronic characteristics of the PNP
          ligands framework that favor the valence disproportionation of
          symmetric binuclear cores was explored. Embodiments described
          herein suggest that the induced asymmetry of Case II in Scheme
          1 is effective in promoting the formation of two-electron
          mixed-valence complexes. The electronic and the steric
          parameters of the bridging PNP ligand may be controlled to
          favor valence disproportionation resulting in two-electron
          mixed-valence species. </p>

          with yields of ca. 25%. A more reliable and general path into
          the rhodium complexes was sought from [XRh.sup.I
          (cyclooctadiene)].sub.2 ("[XRh.sup.I (cod)].sub.2 ") starting
          materials. Rh.sub.2.sup.0,II (dfpma).sub.3 X.sub.2 (L) was

          of [XRh.sup.I (cod)].sub.2, as depicted in Scheme 3. Stirring

          benzene. The CH.sub.2 Cl.sub.2 was then removed and the
          residue washed with 1:5 benzene/pentane to afford an orange
          powder that was dried briefly in vacuo. 1-CO left under vacuum
          for extended periods of time (a few hours) changed color from
          orange to green-blue. This color change was accompanied by
          disappearance of the carbonyl resonance in the IR spectrum,
          indicating loss of an axial CO ligand. </p>
        <p>The solid-state structures for several of the two-electron
          mixed-valence complexes have been determined from single
          crystal X-ray diffraction data. Thermal ellipsoid plots for
          two derivatives, Rh.sub.2.sup.0,II (dfpma).sub.3 Cl.sub.2

          in FIGS. 1(a) and (b). Thermal ellipsoid plots are ball and
          stick type illustrations of structures of chemical compounds.
          The 50% probability thermal motion ellipsoids of the atomic
          sites are derived from anisotropic temperature factor
          parameters to indicate the thermal motion of the atom 50% of
          the time. Tables 1 and 2 list a few metrical parameters of
          complexes comprising the dirhodium cores. The dfpma bond
          distances of these derivatives indicates stabilization of the
          two-electron mixed-valence dirhodium core. For example,
          contraction of the N--P bond distance is observed for the
          phosphorus atoms coordinated to the high-valent Rh.sup.II (avg
          N--P.sup.Rh(II) =1.634(4) .ANG. for 1-PEt.sub.3 and
          1.633(6.ANG. for 2-PPh.sub.3) center, suggesting, but not
          meant to limit the present invention, that the nitrogen lone
          pair moderates the electronic properties of the .pi.-acid
          PF.sub.2 groups. A longer N--P bond distance is observed for
          the phosphorus coordinated to the Rh.sup.0 (avg N--P.sup.Rh(0)
          =1.659(4) .ANG. for 1-PEt.sub.3 and 1.684(5) .ANG. for
          2-PPh.sub.3), consistent with a mechanism theory that there is
          little donation of the nitrogen lone pair to the PF.sub.2
          group coordinated to the low-valent Rh.sup.0 center of the
          complex. </p>

        <p>Other metrical parameters of interest include the bond
          distances of the dirhodium core for various Rh.sub.2.sup.0,II
          (dfpma).sub.3 X.sub.2 (L) derivatives. Lengthening of the
          dirhodium core bond length indicates stability in the
          mixed-valence structure. Several factors lead to structural
          perturbations along the Rh.sup.0 --Rh.sup.II axis, including,
          but not limited to, axial ligand coordination to the Rh.sup.0
          center and halogen coordination to the Rh.sup.II center. The
          metrical data in Table 2 for selected Rh.sub.2.sup.0,II
          complexes gives insight into the effects of each of these
          substitutions. A lengthening of the Rh.sup.0 --Rh.sup.II bond
          distance occurs upon phosphine substitution. Exchange of an
          axial PF.sub.3 in Rh.sup.0,II (dfpma).sub.3
          (Cl.sub.2)(PF.sub.3)("1-PF.sub.3 ") for PEt.sub.3 to form
          Rh.sup.0,II (dfpma).sub.3 (Cl.sub.2) (PEt.sub.3)("1-PEt.sub.3
          ") results in a 0.0405 .ANG. increase in the Rh.sup.0
          --Rh.sup.II separation; similarly, exchange of an axial
          .eta..sup.1 -dfpma for PPh.sub.3 in Rh.sub.2.sup.0,II
          (dfpma).sub.3 Br.sub.2 (.eta..sup.1 -dfpma) ("2-(.eta..sup.1
          -dfpma)") and 2-PPh.sub.3 results in a 0.0403 .ANG. increase
          in the Rh.sup.0 --Rh.sup.II separation. Spectroscopic studies
          presented herein indicate that PF.sub.3 and .eta..sup.1 -dfpma
          exert similar stereo-electronic influence on the dirhodium
          core, permitting a comparison of the ligand effect of
          1-PF.sub.3 with 2-(.eta..sup.1 -dfpma). Substitution of
          bromide for chloride in complexes with these .pi.-acidic axial
          phosphines results in a lengthening of the Rh.sup.0
          --Rh.sup.II bond by 0.013 .ANG.. The magnitude of the
          perturbation exerted by halogen and phosphine substitution on
          the Rh.sup.0 --Rh.sup.II bond distance follows directly from
          the relative donor abilities of each axial ligand. Whereas
          exchange of bromide for chloride at the axial Rh.sup.II
          position results in only a small change in .sigma. donor
          ability, PEt.sub.3 and PPh.sub.3 are significantly better
          .sigma. donors than PF.sub.3 and dfpma, and accordingly weaken
          the metal-metal interaction to a greater extent. </p>

        <p>The preparation of two-electron reduced binuclear rhodium
          complexes was achieved from [XRh(cod)].sub.2 starting
          materials. Treatment of [CIRh(cod)].sub.2 with three
          equivalents of dfpma, followed by two equivalents each of
          cobaltocene and a two-electron donor ligand resulted in the
          formation of binuclear rhodium complexes of the general
          formulation Rh.sub.2.sup.0,0 (dfpma).sub.3 (L).sub.2 (3-L
          where L may be PR.sub.3, P(OR).sub.3, CNR for example), which
          are structurally analogous to Co.sub.2 (dfpma).sub.3 (L).sub.2
          (Scheme 4). The coordination environment is characterized by
          trigonal bipyramidal Rh.sup.0 centers. A formal metal-metal
          bond is supported by three bridging dfpma ligands; the
          PF.sub.2 groups of these bridging ligands define the
          equatorial plane of each Rh.sup.0 center. The axial position,
          trans to the metal-metal bond is capped by a donor ligand,
          electron accepting axial ligands such as, for example,
          PF.sub.3, phosphites or isonitriles impart substantial
          stability, and aryl and alkyl phosphines continuing complexes
          have been prepared as well. The stability of the reduced
          species is illustrated by sublimation of Rh.sub.2.sup.0,0
          (dfpma).sub.3 (PF.sub.3).sub.2 ("3-PF.sub.3 ") and
          Rh.sub.2.sup.0,0 (dfpma).sub.3 (72 .sup.1 -dfpma).sub.2
          ("3-(.eta..sup.1 -dfpma)") under vacuum at 110.degree. C. </p>
        <p>The two-electron oxidized rhodium dimers may be prepared from
          [XRh(cod)].sub.2 by the addition of three equivalents of dfpma
          and five equivalents of PhICl.sub.2 or Br.sub.2 (Scheme 5).
          The excess oxidant may be required to drive the reaction to
          completion, since coordination of the dfpma resulted in the
          production of free 1,5-cyclooctadiene, ##STR4## ##STR5## </p>
        <p>which in turn consumed the halogen oxidant. Use of excess
          oxidant afforded pure Rh.sub.2.sup.II,II (dfpma).sub.3 X.sub.4
          (X=Cl (4), Br (5)) in yields of greater then 90%. The oxidized
          Rh.sub.2.sup.II,II (dfpma).sub.3 X.sub.4 species comprises
          octahedral Rh.sup.II centers connected by a metal-metal bond.
          Three dfpma ligands maintain a bridging coordination mode, and
          halogen ligands occupy axial and equatorial portions on each
          metal center. </p>
        <p>In general, the .sup.1 H and .sup.19 F NMR spectra are useful
          for characterizing the complexes, however due to excessively
          broad peaks in the output, .sup.31 P NMR cannot be used to
          probe the dfpma backbone. The dfpma complexes were not
          fluxional on the NMR time scale. The reduced complexes,
          Rh.sub.2.sup.0,0 (dfpma).sub.3 L.sub.2 (3-L), which display
          D.sub.3d symmetry in solution, show the simplest NMR patterns;
          .sup.1 H and .sup.19 F NMR data for 3-CO, 3-PPh.sub.3,
          3-CN.sup.t Bu, 3-PF.sub.3 and 3-(72 .sup.1 -dfpma) are
          presented in Table 3. In addition to resonances for the axial
          L ligands, a singlet, the electronic state in which the total
          spin angular momentum is zero, is observed for the methyl
          groups of the bridging dfpma ligands in the 2-3 ppm region.
          One resonance is observed for the dfpma ligands near -40 ppm
          in the .sup.19 F NMR spectrum, and is easily identified by a

          to a five-line pattern upon .sup.31 P decoupling, consistent
          with a C.sub.2 symmetric structure for 4 and 5 in solution.
          For illustrative purposes the .sup.19 F and .sup.19 F{.sup.31
          P} NMR spectra of 4 are displayed in FIGS. 2(a) and (b),
          respectively (Table 4 contains the chemical shift values and
          .vertline..sup.1 J.sub.PF +.sup.3 J.sub.PF.vertline. coupling
          constants for both 4 and 5). Notably, the fluorine atoms of
          the PF.sub.2 groups located trans to the halide ligands
          (F.sub.a in the Neumann Projection of FIG. 2(a)) are shifted
          to low frequency at -78.7 ppm. Four AB sub-spectra observed
          inside and outside of the .vertline..sup.1 J.sub.PF +.sup.3
          J.sub.PF.vertline. doublet is indicative of direct (.sup.1
          J.sub.PF) and indirect (.sup.3 J.sub.PF) phosphorus coupling
          constants of opposite sign. Similar XX'AA'X"X'" coupling
          patterns in the resonances at -60.6 and -46.6 ppm identify
          these resonances as the fluorine atoms F.sub.b and F.sub.c,
          respectively, coupled to F.sub.a through the nitrogen
          bridgehead. The remaining resonances at -47.3 and -54.9 ppm
          are assigned as F.sub.d and F.sub.e, respectively, each
          displaying only a doublet with a coupling constant given by

          (dfpma).sub.3 X.sub.2 (L) (X=Cl (1-L), Br (2-L)) complexes
          follows along similar lines. The coordination of a PF.sub.2 of
          one dfpma ligand trans to a halogen on the octahedral
          Rh.sup.II center gives rise to two .sup.1 H NMR methyl
          resonances at 2.8 and 2.9 ppm for the bridging dfpma ligands,
          integrating in a 1:2 ratio, respectively. Additionally, the
          .sup.1 H NMR displays resonances diagnostic of the axial
          ligand, L, capping the Rh.sup.0 center. The .sup.19 F and
          .sup.19 F{.sup.31 P} NMR spectra of 1-PPh.sub.3 are presented
          in FIGS. 2(c) and 2(d) (representative .sup.19 F NMR data for
          1-L can be found in Table 5). Several complex spin systems are
          observed in the .sup.19 F NMR absorption spectrum, but
          simplify to a six-line pattern for the dfpma ligands upon 31P
          decoupling. The structure of 1-PPh.sub.3 is C.sub.s symmetric
          in solution, as can be seen in the Neumann Projection inset
          into FIG. 2(c); the mirror plane is defined by the two rhodium
          centers and the equatorial halogen ligand. By analogy to the
          spectra of 4, the low frequency resonance at -79.3 ppm is
          indicative of a PF.sub.2 group coordinated trans to the halide
          ligand, thus assigned to F.sub.a ; the fluorine atoms of the
          Rh.sup.0 -coordinated PF.sub.2 group (F.sub.b) of this dfpma
          ligand are resolved at -49.5 ppm. The two Rh.sup.0
          -coordinated PF.sub.2 groups (F.sub.e and F.sub.f) are
          observed as .vertline..sup.1 J.sub.PF +.sup.3
          J.sub.PF.vertline. doublets at -40.6 and -41.8 by analogy to
          the Rh.sub.2.sup.0,0 complexes, 3-L. The remaining resonances
          at -35.7 and -52.0 ppm are assigned to the fluorine atoms of
          the remaining Rh.sup.II PF.sub.2 groups, F.sub.c and F.sub.c.

          [ClRh(CO).sub.2 ].sub.2 resulted in an immediate color change,
          affording an intense red solution. Precipitation yielded the
          product as an orange powder, which analyzed as Rh.sub.2
          (dmpma).sub.2 Cl.sub.2 (CO).sub.2 (6). This compound has been
          characterized by X-ray diffraction and has the structure
          depicted in Scheme 6. Infrared spectroscopy showed two CO
          frequencies, at 1989 and 1808 cm.sup.-1, for both terminal and
          bridging CO ligands. However, .sup.31 P NMR spectroscopy
          showed a single resonance at 132.81 ppm with a
          .vertline..sup.1 J.sub.PRh +.sup.n J.sub.PRh.vertline. of 142
          Hz. VT NMR studies suggested a fluxional dirhodium core.
          Cooling of CD.sub.2 Cl.sub.2 solutions of 6, led to broadening
          of the .sup.31 P NMR resonance and a decrease in the observed
          phosphorus-rhodium ##STR6## </p>
        <p>coupling constant; however, the exchange process could not be
          arrested within the accessible temperature range. The solution
          NMR data is nevertheless consistent with the solid-state
          structure of 6 reported in the literature, in which a single
          CO ligand bridges the binuclear Rh.sup.l core. </p>
        <p>Single crystals of 6 were obtained from CH.sub.2 Cl.sub.2
          /heptane solution. Here the X-ray diffraction study gave an
          isomeric structure with two bridging CO groups (FIG. 3). Two
          dmpma ligands bridge a valence-symmetric binuclear rhodium
          core possessing terminal chloride ligands. A Rh--Rh separation
          of 2.7155(10) .ANG. and an intra-ligand P . . . P separation
          of 2.913(3) .ANG. indicate the presence of a formal
          metal-metal bond. Other parameters of note are an average
          Rh--P distance of 2.2867(19) .ANG. and an average P--N
          distance of 1.666(6) .ANG.. The Rh(1)'-Rh(1)-Cl(1) angle is
          159.73(12).degree., and the Rh(1)-Cl(1) distance is normal at
          2.418(4) .ANG.. </p>
        <p><b>Bis(diphenylphosphite)methyl amine (dppma)</b> </p>
        <p>Similar RhI2 products were obtained for the reaction of dppma
          with [ClRh(CO).sub.2 ].sub.2 in CH.sub.2 Cl.sub.2 solution, as
          shown in Scheme 7. Ligand addition resulted in an immediate
          color change from pale yellow-orange to very dark purple.
          Addition of cold pentane caused precipitation of a purple
          powder in moderate yields; elemental analysis suggested the
          formulation Rh.sub.2 (dppma).sub.2 Cl.sub.2 (CO).sub.2 (7).
          Infrared spectra obtained for KBr pellets of the product
          showed only a terminal carbonyl frequency at 2009 cm.sup.-1.
          This, taken with the intense purple color of the complex
          suggested a structure containing face-to-face square planar
          rhodium(I) centers as shown for 7 in Scheme 7. However,
          solutions of the complex showed both bridging and terminal
          carbonyl resonances, and VT NMR studies suggested an
          equilibrium between the face-to-face structure and a structure
          with one bridging carbonyl (8), as observed for 6. </p>
        <p>In solution, 7 slowly rearranged to give a new isomer with
          two bridging CO ligands and two terminal halides, Rh.sub.2
          (dppma).sub.2 Cl.sub.2 (.mu.-CO).sub.2 (9), characterized by a
          single .nu..sub.CO at 1828 cm.sup.1. The .sup.1 H and .sup.31
          P NMR spectra of 9 revealed that this isomer is not fluxional
          in solution. The .sup.1 H NMR spectrum displayed a single
          methyl resonance for the bridging dppma ligands at 2.86 ppm;
          the protons of the phenyl rings are observed in ##STR7## </p>
        <p>the 6.8-7.5 ppm region. A single phosphorus resonance was
          observed in the .sup.31 P NMR spectrum of 9 at 122.61 ppm
          (.vertline..sup.1 J.sub.PRh +.sup.n J.sub.PRh.vertline.=170

        <p>Single crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction studies were
          obtained for 9 and the data confirmed the solution structure
          assignments. FIG. 4 shows a structure with two dppma ligands
          and two CO ligands spanning a short metal-metal separation of
          2.7076(8) .ANG.. The carbonyl ligands bridge the dirhodium
          core in a symmetric fashion with Rh--C(1) and Rh'--C(1)
          distances of 1.990(13) and 2.010(13) .ANG., respectively; the
          Rh--C(1)-Rh' angle is 85.2(4).degree.. The axial halogen has a
          normal Rh--X distance of 2.3379(15) .ANG., and the Cl--Rh--Rh'
          angle is nearly linear at 175.64(6). The PNP backbone is
          symmetric with N--P distances of 1.661(5) and 1.676(5) .ANG.,
          and the intra-ligand P . . . P separation is 2.886(3) .ANG.. </p>
        <p>Solutions of 9 decomposed slowly by loss of the carbonyl
          ligands. The final product observed was the chelated dimer,
          [ClRh(tfepma)].sub.2 (11), which was characterized by a single
          resonance in the .sup.31 P NMR spectrum at 91.13 ppm and an
          apparent J.sub.RhP coupling constant of 280 Hz. Purging
          solutions of 11 with carbon monoxide regenerated rhodium dimer
          7. CO loss from 9 is proposed to proceed through a
          two-electron mixed-valence complex based on a literature
          report of a monocarbonyl derivative of the related
          bis(diphenylphosphite)ethyl amine (dppea) ligand. Single
          crystals of Rh.sub.2.sup.0,II (dppea).sub.2 Cl.sub.2 (CO)
          reportedly were obtained from CHCl.sub.3 solutions of
          Rh.sub.2.sup.I,I (dppea).sub.2 Cl.sub.2 (CO).sub.2 and
          provided the coordination environment depicted for 10 in
          Scheme 7. However, 10 was not explicitly isolated nor
          characterized as an intermediate in the conversion of 9 to 11.
        </p>
        <p>The dppma ligand supported two-electron oxidation and
          reduction of the binuclear rhodium core, yielding
          Rh.sub.2.sup.0,0 and Rh.sub.2.sup.II,II products. 9 was
          reduced with two equivalents of cobaltocene in the presence of
          dppma, affording Rh.sub.2 (dppma).sub.3 (CO).sub.2 (12) as a
          yellow microcrystalline solid. Alternatively, 12 was directly
          prepared from the reaction of [ClRh(CO).sub.2 ].sub.2 with
          three equivalents of dppma and cobaltocene. Single crystals of
          12 were obtained by cooling CH.sub.2 Cl.sub.2 /pentane
          solutions to -35.degree. C. The molecular structure is
          presented in FIG. 5(a) and pertinent metrical parameters are
          listed in Table 6. The metal-metal separation in 12 is long at
          2.8687(8).ANG., however, it is within the range expected for a
          single Rh--Rh bond. The equatorial coordination planes are
          staggered with respect to one another, adopting a torsion
          angle of 35.2.degree.. A C(3)-O(7) bond distance of 1.138(6)
          .ANG. is relatively long, reflecting a decrease in bond order
          of the carbonyl ligand due to coordination to the
          electron-rich Rh.sup.0 center. As expected, the PNP backbone
          of the bridging dppma ligands is symmetric with an average
          P--N distance of 1.681(4) .ANG.. </p>
        <p>Oxidation of 9 with dichloroiodobenzene afforded the
          valence-symmetric Rh.sub.2.sup.II,II dimer Rh.sub.2
          (dppma).sub.2 Cl.sub.4 (CO).sub.2 (13), presented as a thermal
          ellipsoid plot in FIG. 5(b). Alternatively, the reaction of
          [ClRh(cod)].sub.2 with PhICl.sub.2 and dppma yielded 13
          directly. In 13, only two dppma ligands coordinate to the
          bimetallic core, and small donor ligands such as CO or
          isonitrile must be incorporated to yield the six-coordinate
          octahedral geometry at each rhodium center. The metal-metal
          separation is significantly contracted relative to the reduced
          complex, 12. A Rh--Rh' distance of 2.705(3) .ANG. in 13 is
          complimented by a torsion angle for the equatorial planes of
          only 0.9.degree.. The dppma ligands coordinate trans to one
          another, with average Rh--P distances of 2.300(6) .ANG.. The
          Rh--Cl(2) distance of 2.382(7) .ANG. is in the typical range
          for halogens coordinated trans to a Rh--Rh bond. The
          equatorial chloride and carbonyl ligands are coordinated in an
          anti conformation, with Rh--Cl(1) and Rh--C(1) distances of
          2.365(8) and 1.95(4) .ANG., respectively. A short C(1)-O(1)
          bond distance of 1.09(4) reflects little decrease in the CO
          bond order. </p>

        <p>The oxidized and reduced complexes, 12 and 13, of dppma were

        <p><b>Bis(bis(trifluoroethyl)phosphite)methyl amine ("tfepma")</b>
        </p>
        <p>Based on the results of the methoxy- and phenoxy-substituted
          PNP ligands, a phosphorus substituent was sought with stronger
          .pi.-acid properties and a steric parameter larger than
          fluorine. Tolman's steric and electronic map for tertiary
          phosphine ligands shows that functionalization with
          halogenated alkanes and alcohols result in strong .pi.-acid
          characteristics. Tris(2,2,2-trichloroethyl)phosphite has a
          cone angle comparable to other primary alcohol derivatives,
          yet is a stronger .pi.-acid. Therefore, it was surmised that
          the 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol derivative would give a PNP ligand
          with enhanced .pi.-acid character while maintaining steric
          characteristics similar to those of dmpma. </p>
        <p>The reaction of 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol with
          MeN(PCl.sub.2).sub.2 in ether/pentane mixtures at

          MeN[P(OCH.sub.2 CF.sub.3).sub.2 ].sub.2 (tfepma) in moderate
          yield after distillation. The viscous liquid was characterized
          by .sup.1 H NMR spectroscopy, which showed a
          triplet-of-doublets pattern at 2.51 ppm for the methyl protons
          of the methylamine bridgehead and a doublet-of-pentets pattern
          at 3.55 ppm for the methylene protons of the trifluoroethyl
          substituents. The .sup.31 P{.sup.1 H} NMR spectrum showed a
          singlet at 148.6 ppm and the .sup.19 F NMR spectrum showed a
          multiplet centered at -76.90 ppm. </p>

        <p>The pale orange color of [ClRh(CO).sub.2 ].sub.2 in methylene
          chloride immediately changed to dark red upon dropwise
          addition of tfepma. Concentration by vacuum distillation
          followed by addition of pentane afforded a yellow-orange
          powder in moderate yield. Elemental analysis suggested the
          formulation Rh.sub.2 (tfepma).sub.2 Cl.sub.2 (CO).sub.2 (14),
          and infrared spectra obtained on KBr pellets of this product
          showed a carbonyl stretch at 2007 cm.sup.-1. As with the dmpma
          and dppma complexes, 14 is fluxional in solution. At room
          temperature, time-averaged NMR spectra were obtained: a single
          methyl resonance was observed at 2.94 ppm in the .sup.1 H NMR
          spectrum and a symmetric .sup.31 P resonance was observed at
          131.16 ppm (.vertline..sup.1 J.sub.PRh +.sup.n
          J.sub.PRh.vertline.=149 Hz) in the .sup.31 P NMR spectrum.

          tfepma ligands spanning a Rh.sup.I.sub.2 core, axial Cl
          ligands, and bridging and terminal carbonyl ligands is
          assigned for 14 as shown in Scheme 8. </p>
        <p>Modified forcing reaction conditions afforded a doubly
          CO-bridged isomer. Refluxing [ClRh(CO).sub.2 ].sub.2 with two
          equivalents of tfepma in toluene gave Rh.sub.2 (tfepma).sub.2
          Cl.sub.2 (.mu.-CO).sub.2 (15) in quantitative yield. Infrared
          spectroscopy showed only a bridging carbonyl stretch at 1824
          cm.sup.-1. .sup.31 P NMR spectroscopy again revealed a
          symmetric complex, with a single resonance at 128.4 ppm
          (.vertline..sup.1 J.sub.PRh +.sup.n J.sub.PRh.vertline.=164
          Hz). The IR and NMR data are consistent with rearrangement of
          the metal core to give a structure analogous to 9. However,
          unlike the dppma compound, 15 is thermally robust and is not
          subject to further rearrangements of the metal core in the
          absence of other reagents: even at reflux in toluene, CO was
          not lost from the complex. ##STR8## </p>
        <p>Treatment of solutions of 14 or 15 with one equivalent of
          tfepma gave a dark red solution from which maroon crystals
          were deposited upon prolonged standing. The crystals proved
          suitable for X-ray diffraction studies and yielded the
          molecular structure presented in FIG. 6 for Rh.sub.2.sup.0,II
          (tfepma).sub.3 Cl.sub.2 (CO) (16). As observed for the dfpma
          chemistry of rhodium, three tfepma ligands span the bimetallic
          core of 16. The two-electron mixed-valence complex comprises
          octahedral Rh.sup.II and trigonal bipyramidal Rh.sup.0
          centers. The axial site of the Rh.sup.0 is coordinated by a CO
          ligand, and two chloride ligands occupy axial and equatorial
          sites of the Rh.sup.II. The metal-metal separation is normal
          at 2.7662(11) .ANG.. Rh--P bond distances are longer by an
          average of 0.037 .ANG. than those observed for the dfpma
          complexes due to the greater steric demand of the P(OCH.sub.2
          CF.sub.3).sub.2 groups. Other metrical parameters for 16 are
          listed in Table 7, and in general suggest an expanded core
          coordination environment for the dirhodium center. </p>
        <p>In solution, the two-electron mixed-valence complex was
          unstable with respect to loss of the axial CO ligand. The
          principal species observed by NMR spectroscopy was in fact the
          halogen-bridged Rh.sup.I.sub.2 dimer with two chelating tfepma
          ligands, [ClRh(tfepma)].sub.2 (17). This complex was prepared
          independently by the addition of two equivalents of tfepma to
          [ClRh(cod)].sub.2. The symmetric dimer was treated with one
          equiv of tfepma and one equiv of CN.sup.t Bu to reform the
          two-electron mixed-valence complex, Rh.sub.2.sup.0,II
          (tfepma).sub.3 Cl.sub.2 (CN.sup.t Bu), with an axial

          Rh.sub.2.sup.II,II (tfepma).sub.3 Cl.sub.4 in moderate yields.
          X-ray diffraction studies on single crystals of this product
          yielded the molecular structure depicted in FIG. 7(a),
          identifying the complex as the syn isomer,
          syn-Rh.sub.2.sup.II,II (tfepma).sub.3 Cl.sub.4 (19). If the
          reaction instead was conducted at reflux in toluene, an orange
          product was obtained, the solid-state structure as determined
          by X-ray diffraction identified this product as the anti
          isomer, anti-Rh.sub.2.sup.II,II (tfepma).sub.3 Cl.sub.4 (20).
          The molecular structure for 20 is presented in FIG. 7(b).
          Selected bond distances and angles for each complex are
          presented in Table 8. Comparison of the two isomers reveals a
          significant contraction of the metal core for 19. The
          Rh(1)-Rh(2) separation in the syn isomer is 2.6688(8) .ANG.,
          whereas the metal-metal distance in 20 is 2.7152(10) .ANG..
          Similarly, the metal-phosphorus and metal-halogen distances
          are markedly different: the Rh--P distances in 20 are longer
          by 0.045 .ANG. and the axial and equatorial Rh--Cl distances
          are elongated by 0.062 and 0.061 .ANG., respectively. The syn
          isomer also shows a much smaller twist about the Rh--Rh axis,
          with an average torsion angle of 26.8.degree. as compared to
          that of the anti isomer at 40.4.degree., which is almost
          perfectly eclipsed. </p>

        <p>The structural differences between the syn and anti isomers
          of Rh.sub.2.sup.II,II (tfepma).sub.3 Cl.sub.4 are manifested
          in the absorption and emission spectra of each complex,
          presented in FIG. 8. The absorption spectra of 19 and 20 are
          dominated by three bands in the near-UV and visible regions.
          Two high-energy bands, assigned to transitions from the
          configurationally mixed Cl(.sigma.)/d.sub.z.sub..sup.2 .sigma.
          to the d.sub.z.sub..sup.2 .sigma.* LUMO, shift little between
          the two isomeric forms. However, the lowest energy transition
          shows a pronounced dependence on the geometry of the dirhodium
          core: the transition, of d.pi.*.fwdarw.d.sub.z.sub..sup.2
          .sigma.* parentage, shifts from 352 nm in 19 to 458 nm in 20.
          This red shift of over 6500 cm.sup.-1 is accompanied by a
          decrease in the extinction coefficient of the band from 11,000
          M.sup.-1 cm.sup.-1 to 4700 M.sup.-1 cm.sup.-1 for the syn and
          anti isomers, respectively. Excitation of solid samples of
          both 19 and 20 cooled to 77 K results in visible luminescence.
          The emission spectrum of 19 is dominated by bright, long-lived
          phosphorescence observed at 819 nm (.tau.=350 .mu.s). A
          high-energy band is also observed at 578 nm (.tau.&lt;8 ns),
          but has only 1/100.sup.th of the intensity of the
          phosphorescent peak, suggesting facile deactivation of the
          .sup.1 d.sub.z.sub..sup.2 .sigma.* excited state. Conversely,
          both fluorescence and phosphorescence are strong for 20. A
          high-energy emission band at 573 nm (.tau.&lt;8 ns) and a
          low-energy emission band at 857 nm (.tau.=150 .mu.s) are
          observed with an intensity ratio of 1:2 (the relative
          intensities of 19 to 20 were not determined). </p>
        <p>The influence of structure on electronic character is further
          emphasized by the similarity between the electronic features
          of 20 and the dfpma congener, Rh.sub.2.sup.II,II (dfpma).sub.3
          Cl.sub.4 (4). The absorption maxima of the two high-energy
          transitions are essentially identical and the low energy
          d.pi.*.fwdarw.d.sub.z.sub..sup.2 .sigma.* transition of 20 is
          red-shifted by only 640 cm.sup.-1 relative to the same
          transition in 4. Though negligible differences are observed in
          the fluorescence emission maxima, the phosphorescence of 20 is
          red shifted by 511 cm.sup.-1. This small low-energy shift is
          diagnostic of a weaker metal-metal interaction in 20, and
          correlates well with the observed difference in metal-metal
          separation for 4 and 20 (.DELTA.Rh(1)-Rh(2)=0.008(1) .ANG.). </p>
        <p><b>A Chelating tfepma Ligand</b> </p>
        <p>The tfepma ligand may be used to stabilize a new two-electron
          mixed-valence rhodium platform in the absence of an axial
          donor ligand. [ClRh(cod)].sub.2 reacted with three equivalents
          of tfepma in CH.sub.2 Cl.sub.2, affording Rh.sub.2.sup.0,II
          (tfepma).sub.3 Cl.sub.2 (21). Dark green single crystals of 21
          were obtained by diffusing pentane into a CH.sub.2 Cl.sub.2
          solution of the complex. The structure presented in FIG. 9 was
          obtained from X-ray diffraction studies; selected bond
          distances and angles are presented in Table 9. The molecular
          structure of 21 reveals a departure from the coordination
          geometry observed for other diphosphazane complexes of
          rhodium. In the absence of a suitable donor ligand for the
          Rh.sup.0 center, a tfepma ligand binds in a chelating mode
          leaving only two tfepma ligands to bridge the bimetallic core.
          A consequence of this chelating ligand is the vacant axial
          coordination site at the Rh.sup.II center. Two phosphorus of
          the bridging tfepma ligands and one phosphorus of the
          chelating tfepma ligand define the equatorial plane of a
          distorted trigonal bipyramidal Rh.sup.0 center. The axial
          positions are capped by the other phosphorus of the chelate
          and the proximate Rh.sup.II center, bound at a metal-metal
          separation of 2.7529(19) .di-elect cons.. The Rh.sup.0 center
          defines the apex of a square pyramid about the Rh.sup.II
          center. Two phosphorus of the bridging tfepma ligands and two
          chloride ligands occupy cis positions of the basal plane, with
          P(2)-Rh(2)-P(4) and Cl(1)-Rh(2)-Cl(2) angles of
          95.65(18).degree. and 86.52(18).degree., respectively. </p>

        <p>As a preliminary investigation of the electronic factors
          associated with exchanging the methyl group on the nitrogen
          bridgehead, 3,5-xylidene was refluxed in PCl.sub.3 to afford
          bis(dichlorophosphine)-3,5-xylidene (dcpx). This precursor can
          be further functionalized as shown in Scheme 2, yielding the
          same variety of phosphorus groups for metal coordination.
          Fluorination with SbF.sub.3 provided
          bis(difluorophosphine)xylidene (dfpx) in good yields after
          recrystallization from pentane and sublimation. Similarly,
          2,2,2-trifluoroethanol reacted with dcpx to yield the
          corresponding trifluoroethyl derivative
          bis(bis(trifluoroethyl)phosphite)-3,5-xylidene (tfepx) as a
          crystalline solid from pentane. </p>
        <p><b>Bis(difluorophosphine)-3,5-xylidene (dfpx)</b> </p>
        <p>Two-electron mixed-valence complexes of dfpx were prepared by
          the strategy presented in Scheme 3. A dirhodium core
          isostructural to 1 and 2 is presented in FIG. 10 for
          Rh.sub.2.sup.0,II (dfpx).sub.3 Br.sub.2 (PPh.sub.3) (22). The
          metrical parameters for the metal core of 22 are presented in
          Table 10, and are similar to those of the corresponding
          dfpma-bridged dirhodium complexes (Table 2); the N--P
          distances for the bridging dfpx ligands are 1.611(18) and
          1.679(16) .ANG. for the phosphines coordinated to the
          Rh.sup.II and Rh.sup.0 centers, respectively. The aryl rings
          on the nitrogen bridgehead align perpendicularly to the
          P--N--P plane, with an average dihedral angle of 90.4.degree..
          At 2.819(3) .ANG., the metal-metal separation is slightly
          shorter than that of the dfpma derivative; Rh--Br distances of
          2.570(3) and 2.463(5) are contracted as well. Other ligand
          distances are undistinguished from the dfpma analog. </p>

        </p>
        <p>The reaction of tfepx with [ClRh(cod)].sub.2 did not provide
          direct access to a two-electron mixed-valence complex. Rather,
          a bright yellow microcrystalline product precipitated from the
          green solution afforded by 1:3 mixtures of the rhodium
          starting material and ligand in CH.sub.2 Cl.sub.2. Elemental
          analysis suggested the empirical formulation Rh.sub.2
          (tfepx).sub.3 Cl.sub.2, consistent with the formulation of 21.
          However, X-ray diffraction studies revealed a divergent
          binuclear RhI structure, [ClRh(tfepx)].sub.2 (.mu.-tfepx)
          (23), shown as a thermal ellipsoid plot in FIG. 11. Here, two
          four-coordinate RhI fragments are tethered by a bridging tfepx
          ligand. A single chloride and a chelating tfepx ligand
          complete the distorted square planar coordination environment
          about each rhodium center. An average intra-ligand P--Rh--P
          angle of 70.38(8).degree. is acute for a square-planar metal
          complex, suggesting a significant degree of strain in the
          four-membered chelate ring. All tfepx ligands show symmetric
          PNP backbones, with an average N--P distance of 1.694(6)
          .ANG.. As observed in the structure of 22, the aryl ring of
          the bridging tfepx ligand is nearly orthogonal to the
          P(2)-N(2)-P(3) plane, adopting a torsion angle of
          81.4.degree.. Conversely, the aryl rings of the chelating
          tfepx ligands of 23 are rotated to be coplanar with the
          P--N--P triad, displaying torsion angles of 14.30 and 9.10 for
          the tfepx ligands of the Rh(1) and Rh(2) centers,
          respectively. Rotation of the aryl rings into the P--N--P
          plane delocalizes the nitrogen lone pair into the aromatic
          system, shortening the N--C bond. In accord with this
          suggestion, the average N--C bond length for the chelating
          tfepx ligands is 1.446(9) .ANG. versus 1.485(9) .ANG. for the
          N--C bond of the bridging tfepx ligand. </p>
        <p>Isolation of discrete two-electron mixed-valence complexes of
          rhodium relies on a delicate balance of stereo-electronic
          properties within the diphosphazane ligand framework. The
          results suggest that in addition to the coordination of three
          ligands to the binuclear core, the strong .pi.-acid phosphine
          groups and a polarizable lone pair on the nitrogen bridgehead
          atom help induce valence-symmetric cores to disproportionate.
        </p>
        <p>The fluorinated diphosphazane, dfpma, rapidly reacts with
          Rh.sup.I starting materials to afford two-electron
          mixed-valence complexes in nearly quantitative yields. The
          strong .pi.-acid character of the difluorophosphine groups
          coupled with the small steric parameter facilitates
          coordination of three ligands to the bimetallic core. Crystal
          structures of various derivatives of 1 provide evidence for
          induced polarization of the PNP backbone as proposed in Scheme
          1. A contracted N--P bond for the phosphines coordinated to
          the Rh.sup.II center is indicative of significant N.fwdarw.P
          donation, serving to stabilize the .pi.-acid phosphines
          coordinated to the oxidized metal center. With the N lone pair
          electron density channeled away from the PF.sub.2 groups
          bonded to the Rh.sup.0, the strong .pi. accepting properties
          of this phosphine are maintained and hence the reduced rhodium
          center is stabilized. </p>
        <p>In complexes with only two bridging diphosphazane ligands,
          valence disproportion of the binuclear rhodium core is
          circumvented. The dmpma and dppma ligands exclusively form 2:1
          complexes with divalent rhodium cores. In these cases, valence
          disproportionation is not observed, and only symmetric
          Rh.sup.l.sub.2 cores are obtained. Within the framework
          outlined in Scheme 1, coordination of two diphosphazane
          ligands defeats induced polarization of the ligand backbone.
          Scheme 9 shows that coordination of two diphosphazane ligands
          to a binuclear complex provides the system a facile
          comproportionation pathway to produce symmetric cores.
          Polarization of one PNP ligand via donation of the nitrogen
          lone pair to one phosphine group is countered by lone pair
          donation in the opposite direction for the other bridging
          ligand. N--P bond lengths for the Rh.sup.I complexes of dmpma
          and dppma support this contention: 6 shows N--P bond distances
          of 1.670(6) .ANG. and 1.661(6) .ANG. and 9 shows N--P
          distances of 1.661(5) .ANG. and 1.676(5) .ANG.. The literature
          report of Rh.sub.2.degree. l(dppea).sub.2 Cl.sub.2 (CO)
          indicates that two diphosphazanes may be able to stabilize a
          two-electron mixed-valence species transiently, but results
          presented here suggest that such a complex rapidly rearranges
          in solution to give symmetric species. </p>
        <p>The driving force for valence disproportionation engendered
          by coordination of a third PNP ligand is illustrated by the
          conversion of 15 to 16 as shown in Scheme 8. In the absence of
          a third tfepma ligand, the Rh.sup.I. . . Rh.sup.I core of 15
          is robust, withstanding refluxing toluene without
          rearrangement or ligand loss. However, addition ##STR9## </p>
        <p>of one equivalent of tfepma to room temperature solutions of
          15 induces valence disproportionation to the Rh.sub.2.sup.0,II
          species, 16. It is suggested that although the symmetrization
          mechanism of Scheme 9 is operative in 15, introduction of a
          third tfepma ligand "frustrates" the binuclear core, thus
          forcing the system to polarize and form the two-electron
          mixed-valence complex. </p>
        <p>Interplay of the .pi.-acid phosphine with the nitrogen lone
          pair defines the ligands' ability to polarize the binuclear
          core. Diphosphazane functionalization at phosphorus and
          nitrogen may be used to probe these mediating effects of the
          nitrogen atom. The methyl amine bridgehead provides maximum
          participation of the nitrogen lone pair in .pi. bonding with
          the proximate phosphine groups. Conversely, competition for
          the nitrogen lone pair is possible in diphosphazanes with
          aniline bridgeheads. Participation of the bridgehead nitrogen
          lone pair in the .pi. system of an aryl group might
          drastically influence the ability of a diphosphazanes to
          stabilize two-electron mixed valence cores. Isolation of 22 in
          high yields suggests that the strong .pi.-accepting properties
          of the difluorophosphine group override the electron accepting
          properties of the dfpx aryl group. Rotation of the aryl group
          perpendicular to the P--N--P plane completely decouples the 1
          system from the PNP backbone and indicates complete
          utilization of the nitrogen lone pair by the PF.sub.2 groups.
          Comparison of the absorption spectrum of 22 to the analogous
          dfpma complex 2-PPh.sub.3 lends further support to the
          electronic homology between the dfpx and dfpma ligands. The
          low energy d.pi.*.fwdarw.d.sigma.* transition, which should be
          most sensitive to changes in the electronic properties of the
          bridging diphosphazane, blue-shifts by only 59 cm.sup.1 upon
          substitution of dfpx for dfpma in 22 and 2-PPh.sub.3,
          respectively. Conversely, the aryl .pi. system competes
          effectively with the weaker .pi.-acid group
          bis(trifluoroethyl)phosphite for the nitrogen lone pair of
          tfepx. This competition forces the tfepx system to adopt a
          valence-symmetric configuration. Whereas the coordination of
          three tfepma ligands to a Rh.sub.2 core produces the
          two-electron mixed-valence complex 21, tfepx provides a
          structure for 23 with two non-interacting Rh.sup.I centers.
          Rotation of the aryl ring of the chelating tfepx ligands into
          the P--N--P plane indicates a significant degree of
          N.fwdarw.aryl lone pair donation. Contracted N--C bond lengths
          for the chelating ligands further support this contention.
          Apparently, in the tfepx case, interaction of the nitrogen
          bridgehead with the aryl .pi. system reduces the
          polarizability of the lone pair and thus valence
          disproportionation is not observed. </p>
        <p>Manipulation of the steric and electronic properties of the
          phosphorus substituents of the PNP ligand set leads to varied
          chemical reactivity. The juxtaposition of strong .pi.-acid
          phosphines with the nitrogen lone pair in dfpma leads to a
          polarization of the PNP backbone to stabilize the two-electron
          mixed-valence species. Furthermore, incorporation of
          sequentially more .pi.-acidic phosphines revealed a
          step-by-step rearrangement of the binuclear Rh.sup.I core
          culminating with valence disproportionation and formation of a
          two-electron mixed-valence core. Diphosphazane ligands with
          small steric requirements, in addition to the requisite
          .pi.-acidity, incorporate a third bridging ligand into the
          binuclear core. At least three ligands may be required to
          stabilize the two-electron mixed-valence complex and overcome
          the thermodynamic driving force for valence-symmetric
          binuclear cores. </p>

            Complex Ir.sub.2.sup.0,II (tfepma).sub.3 Cl.sub.2</b> </p>
        <p>The chemistry of two-electron mixed valency was generalized
          to transition metals other than rhodium. Ongoing interest in
          hydrogen photocatalysis, suggested investigation of the
          two-electron mixed-valence chemistry of iridium to acquire an
          understanding of the hydrido and hydrido-halo chemistry of
          this new class of compounds. Ir.sub.2.sup.0,II (tfepma).sub.3
          Cl.sub.2, was used for consideration of the stability of
          third-row metal-hydride bonds, to systematically investigate
          the reaction chemistry of H.sub.2, HX and X.sub.2 with
          M.sub.2.sup.0,II cores. </p>
        <p>Homogeneous metal complexes provide a useful tool for probing
          small molecule reactivity with spectroscopic techniques
          available for thermodynamic and kinetic studies. Significant
          advances have been made in understanding the operation of
          industrial catalysts through the reactivity studies of
          mononuclear inorganic and organometallic complexes. This
          insight has led to the discovery of homogeneous molecular
          catalysts that rival their heterogeneous brethren in both
          activity and long-term stability. Furthermore, the advantage
          of "molecular tuning," provides substrate and product
          selectivities unprecedented in heterogeneous catalysis. </p>
        <p>Notwithstanding, an advantage of the heterogeneous catalyst
          is the cooperative reactivity afforded by adjacent metal
          centers available at the catalyst surface. Many industrial
          processes from olefin polymerization to nitrogen fixation and
          carbon monoxide functionalization rely on such cooperativity
          for efficient operation. Though interest in multi-metallic
          homogenous catalysts is longstanding, the chemistry of
          transition metal clusters is less advanced than that of
          mononuclear compounds. Whereas the same palette of reactions,
          such as oxidative-addition, reductive-elimination and atom
          transfer, is available to mononuclear and multinuclear metal
          complexes, cluster compounds are distinguished by reactivity
          patterns arising from cooperative effects. For example,
          .beta.-hydrogen elimination is a well-known reaction observed
          for late ##STR10## </p>
        <p>transition metal alkyl complexes leading to the formation of
          a metal-hydride-olefin complex. Conversely, alkyl cluster
          complexes have been observed to react by .alpha.-hydrogen
          abstraction pathways; the proximity of the second metal center
          can interact in a cooperative fashion to activate the nearest
          C--H bond. </p>
        <p>The logical starting point for the development of
          multi-metallic catalysts is with the simplest type of cluster
          compounds. The chemistry of bimetallic transition metal
          complexes largely parallels that of analogous mononuclear
          complexes, since their construction is often predicated on the
          assembly of mononuclear metal fragments. As an example, in
          Scheme 10, the chemistry of square planar d.sup.8 metal
          fragments tethered with one or more bridging ligands, typified
          by pyrazolate-bridged Rh.sup.I and Ir.sup.I dimers, is
          dominated by oxidative addition and reductive elimination.
          Addition occurs either across the bimetallic core to yield a
          d.sup.9 --d.sup.9 dimer, or is localized at one metal of the
          complex to yield a d.sup.8.fwdarw.d.sup.10 complex. Subsequent
          functionalization of substrates has been achieved, but
          coupling of the two metal centers impedes further reactivity,
          which obviates the development of an efficient catalytic
          cycle. Binuclear complexes that avoid the alternate making and
          breaking of a metal-metal bond show enhanced potential for
          catalyst development. For example, the A-frame derived
          complexes, [MM'(dppm).sub.2 (CO).sub.3 ] (M=M'=Rh, Ir; M=Ir,
          M'=Rh), possess a formal metal-metal bond by virtue of
          coordinative unsaturation that is maintained upon substrate
          addition. As a result, further substrate addition and
          functionalization reactivity is observed after the initial
          activation step. </p>
        <p>The diphosphazane ligand framework provides an excellent
          opportunity to develop new systems for small molecule
          activation and transformation reactions. The coordination
          chemistry of dfpma, dppma and tfepma with rhodium elucidates a
          ligand framework capable of stabilizing a variety of metal
          geometries and oxidation states while preserving a metal-metal
          interaction. A foray into the chemistry of these ligands with
          iridium, has led to the preparation of a two-electron
          mixed-valence complex, Ir.sub.2.sup.0,II (tfepma).sub.3
          Cl.sub.2. The unique electronic and coordinative structure of
          this compound provides a novel platform for the detailed study
          of small molecule activation reactions en route to catalytic
          functionalization schemes. The inventors conducted structure
          and reactivity studies of Ir.sub.2.sup.0,II (tfepma).sub.3
          Cl.sub.2 with H.sub.2, HX and X.sub.2 substrates, revealing a
          binuclear metal complex that maintains the facile addition
          pathways of mononuclear complexes with the caveat of a
          neighboring metal center to promote cooperative activation of
          small molecule substrates. </p>
        <p><b>Iridium Chemistry of dfpma and dppma</b> </p>
        <p>Building upon studies of bis(phosphine)amine ligands with
          rhodium, the chemistry of these ligands with iridium was
          developed. The reaction of dfpma (dfpma
          =bis(difluorophosphine)methylamine) with monomeric iridium (I)
          starting materials such as ClIr(CO)(PPh.sub.3).sub.2 leads to
          the formation of monomeric materials, ClIr(L)(dfpma) (L=CO,
          PPh.sub.3). Similarly, in the absence of a suitable ligand,
          addition of two equivalents of dfpma leads to the formation of
          the dfpma-chelated dimer, [ClIr(dfpma)].sub.2. Synthetic
          methodologies that typically provided high-yields of
          two-electron mixed-valence dirhodium products, invariably gave
          intractable oils with iridium, as illustrated by the reaction
          of three equivalents of dfpma and one equivalent of L
          (L=P(OR).sub.3, PR.sub.3, CNR) with [ClIr(cod)].sub.2, which
          affords orange to red oils that elude crystallization. </p>
        <p>A two-electron mixed-valence iridium complex was obtained
          when dfpma was added to [ClIr(cod)].sub.2 in the presence of
          excess PhICl.sub.2. A yellow microcrystalline powder was
          obtained in moderate yield. X-ray diffraction studies on
          single crystals yielded the results presented in FIG. 12 and
          Table 11. Ir.sub.2.sup.I,III (dfpma).sub.2 Cl.sub.4 (cod) (31)
          is structurally divergent from the observed rhodium dfpma
          chemistry: two dfpma ligands span a binuclear iridium core
          composed of octahedral Ir.sup.I and Ir.sup.III centers rotated
          by 47.1.degree.. The metal-metal separation in 31 is long at
          2.8657(6) .ANG., but still within the range observed for other
          diiridium complexes with a formal metal-metal bond. A single
          1,5-cyclooctadiene ligand remains coordinated to the Ir.sup.I
          center, occupying an axial site and an equatorial site trans
          to one chloride ligand. Three chloride ligands coordinate to
          the iridium(III) center, adopting a facial geometry, with
          surprisingly similar Ir.sup.III --Cl bond distances of
          2.407(3) and 2.417(3) .ANG. for the two equatorial and axial
          chloride ligands, respectively. The similarity in Ir.sup.III
          --Cl distances further indicates a weakened metal-metal bond;
          normally a significant trans influence is observed in the M-X
          distances for halogens coordinated opposite to a strong
          metal-metal bond. The octahedral Ir.sup.III is completed by
          two cis disposed PF.sub.2 groups, bonded at an average Ir--P
          distance of 2.170(3) .ANG.. The dfpma ligands display an
          induced asymmetry across the binuclear core, with an average
          N--P bond distance of 1.639(10) .ANG. to the Ir.sup.III
          -coordinated phosphorus and an average N--P bond distance of
          1.660(9) .ANG. to the Ir.sup.I -coordinated phosphorus. The
          PF.sub.2 groups coordinated to the Ir.sup.I center adopt a
          transoid arrangement (P(1)-Ir(1)-P(3)=155.56(10).degree.),
          resulting in significantly longer Ir.sup.I --P distances of
          2.281(3) .ANG.. Metal-olefin distances to the C.dbd.C centroid
          of the chelating 1,5-cyclooctadiene ligand are distinguished
          for the axial and equatorial coordination sites at 2.222(11)
          and 2.182(11) .ANG., respectively. In accord with these
          different metal-olefin distances, C(3)-C(4) and C(7)-C(8)
          distances of 1.381(16) and 1.356(17) .ANG., respectively,
          reflect a slight decrease in C--C bond order for the more
          tightly bound equatorial olefin. </p>

          of excess oxidant. Insoluble molecular compounds precipitate

          cooled to -35.degree. C., and yielded the molecular structure
          depicted in FIG. 13. As observed in the structure of 31, two
          PNP ligands bridge the binuclear metal core, with a third
          chelating dppma ligand replacing the chelating
          1,5-cyclooctadiene ligand of 31. Notably, in the absence of an
          external oxidant, the divalent Ir.sub.2 core activates a C--H
          bond at an ortho position of the phenyl ring of one of the
          bridging dppma ligands. A metal-metal distance of 2.7919(15)
          .ANG. is consistent with an Ir.sup.I.fwdarw.Ir.sup.II dative
          bond. A vacant coordination site at the Ir.sup.I metal center
          (P(3)-Ir(1)-P(5)=160.7(3).degree. and
          P(6)-Ir(1)-Ir(2)=167.57(18).degree.) is presumably occupied by
          the abstracted hydrogen atom from the orthometallated phenyl
          group. .sup.1 H NMR spectroscopy of 32 confirms the presence
          of a hydride ligand by the presence of a single low frequency
          resonance observed at -17.08 ppm. Coordination to the hydride
          to the Ir.sup.I center is established by an apparent
          doublet-of-triplet-of-doublets pattern with a .sup.2 J.sub.HP
          coupling constant of 218 Hz to the trans phosphorus atoms and
          .sup.2 J.sub.HP couplings of 17 and 12 Hz to the cis

          two of the three bidentate ligands bridge the binuclear core
          of 33 with the third ligand binding as a chelate. The Ir.sup.0
          center possesses distorted trigonal bipyramidal geometry that
          is typical for d.sup.9 metals. Two equatorial sites of the

          for 33 in solution (FIG. 15(a)). A low frequency singlet at
          20.91 ppm is assigned to the axial phosphorus coordinated to
          the Ir.sup.0 center; the apparent triplet at 65.59 ppm is the
          equatorial phosphorus of the chelating tfepma ligand. The
          excessively broad singlet at 80.19 ppm is assigned to the
          Ir.sup.II -coordinated phosphites leaving the high-frequency
          resonance to the Ir.sup.0 -coordinated phosphites of the
          bridging tfepma ligands. The .sup.1 H NMR spectrum at
          20.degree. C. is consistent with a symmetric complex as well,
          only two methyl resonances at 2.93 and 2.62 ppm are observed
          for the tfepma ligands, integrating in a 2:1 ration for the
          bridging and chelating ligands, respectively. Upon cooling to
          -80.degree. C., the fluxional behavior of 33 is arrested,
          giving the NMR spectra of FIG. 15(b). The resonance for the
          chelating tfepma ligand is largely unchanged in the .sup.1 H
          NMR spectrum, however, the resonance for the bridging tfepma
          ligand is split into distinct signals at 3.17 and 2.70 ppm
          (.DELTA.=238 Hz), indicating an inequivalence of the bridging
          tfepma ligand. Even more dramatic changes are observed in the
          .sup.31 P NMR spectrum. In addition to a significant
          improvement in line shape for the resonances of the chelating
          tfepma ligand, two distinct signals can be resolved in the
          100-110 ppm region for the equatorial phosphites of the
          bridging tfepma ligands. The most striking feature is the
          separation of two very different Ir.sup.II -phosphite
          resonances, at 78.31 and 89.77 ppm (.DELTA.=2321 Hz),
          immediately suggesting the coordination of different ligands
          across the metal center from the phosphorus atoms. </p>
        <p>Rate constants for the fluxional process equilibrating the
          Ir.sup.II -phosphites were determined by monitoring the .sup.1
          H methyl resonances of the bridging tfepma ligands in d.sup.8
          -THF over the temperature range of -70.degree. C. to
          +30.degree. C.; analysis of the Eyring plot yields activation
          parameters of .DELTA.H.sup.{character pullout} =13.+-.1 kcal
          mol.sup.-1 and .DELTA.S.sup.{character pullout} =6.6.+-.2 cal
          mole.sup.-1 K.sup.-1. A similar exchange process is observed
          in CD.sub.3 CN, and evaluation of the corresponding kinetic
          data reveals a strongly solvent dependent process: over a
          temperature range of -5.degree. C. to +30.degree. C.,
          .DELTA.H.sup.{character pullout} and .DELTA.S.sup.{character
          pullout} were determined to be 25.+-.4 kcal mol.sup.-1 and
          38.+-.5cal mol.sup.-1 K.sup.-1, respectively. The positive
          activation entropies in both solvent systems comply with a
          dissociative process. This, taken with the differences in
          chemical shift for the Ir.sup.II -phosphites suggests the
          equilibrium depicted by reaction (i) of Scheme 11, in which a
          THF or MeCN ligand reversibly binds to an equatorial Ir.sup.II
          site with concomitant shift of a halide to the position
          opposite the metal-metal bond. ##STR11## </p>
        <p>The solvent adduct 34, see FIG. 16 has been isolated and
          structurally characterized; FIG. 16(a) shows a thermal
          ellipsoid plot for Ir.sub.2.sup.0,II (tfepma).sub.3 Cl.sub.2
          (MeCN) (4-MeCN). As deduced from NMR studies, the coordination
          core of the parent complex, 33 in Scheme 11, is mostly
          unchanged, with two chelating tfepma ligands and a third
          tfepma ligand chelated to the Ir.sup.0 center; a slight
          elongation of the metal-metal separation accompanies
          coordination of the acetonitrile ligand. Table 13 presents
          other pertinent metrical parameters of the Ir.sup.0
          --Ir.sup.II core of 34. </p>
        <p><b>Addition of Strong .sigma.-Donors to 33 (ii of Scheme 11)</b>
        </p>
        <p>In contrast to the solution behavior of 33, .sigma.-donating
          ligands such as isonitriles, phosphines and even halides,
          coordinate the Ir.sup.II center at the axial position, trans
          to the metal-metal bond yielding species of the formulation
          Ir.sub.2.sup.0,II (tfepma).sub.3 Cl.sub.2 (L) (35-L, L=CNR,
          PR.sub.3, X.sup.-). As is apparent in the thermal ellipsoid
          plot of the CN.sup.t Bu derivative, Ir.sub.2.sup.0,II
          (tfepma).sub.3 Cl.sub.2 (CN.sup.t Bu) (35-CN.sup.t Bu) shown
          in FIG. 16(b), the Ir.sub.2.sup.0,II mixed-valence core is
          preserved upon addition of the donor ligand. Apart from the
          differing coordination positions of the MeCN and CN.sup.t Bu
          ligands, the X-ray crystal structure of 35-CN.sup.t Bu is
          largely undistinguished from that of 34. Metrical parameters
          of the bimetallic core are presented for comparison in Table
          13. In agreement with the solid-state results, the integration
          ratios for the proton resonances of the axial ligands of 35-L
          to those of the tfepma ligands establish that only one donor
          ligand is incorporated into the diiridium coordination sphere.
          Moreover, room temperature NMR spectra of the addition
          products with strong .sigma.-donor ligands reveal static
          solution structures that are consistent with the results of
          X-ray crystallography. Notably, the Ir.sup.II -coordinated
          phosphites of the 35-L species give rise to sharp, apparent
          triplets in the .sup.31 P{.sup.1 H} NMR spectrum between 66
          and 73 ppm. The absence of fluxional behavior is also in
          evidence from the sharp high frequency doublet resonances at
          about 95 ppm for the Ir.sup.0 -coordinated phosphites of the
          bridging ligands. The .sup.31 P resonance for the axial
          Ir.sup.0 -phosphite is sensitive to the coordination of an
          axial ligand at Ir.sup.II, shifting to progressively higher
          frequency (.delta.=35.0, 52.5 and 53.3 ppm along the series
          L=Br.sup.-, PEt.sub.3, CN.sup.t Bu) with increasing L
          .sigma.-donor strength. </p>

        <p>Halogen removal from 33 can be effected with silver or
          thallium hexafluorophosphate in acetonitrile solution. A
          highly crystalline product analyzing as [Ir.sub.2.sup.0,II
          (tfepma).sub.3 (MeCN).sub.3 ][PF.sub.6 ].sub.2 (6[PF.sub.6
          ].sub.2) is recovered in quantitative yield. Solution NMR
          spectroscopy suggests preservation of the Ir.sub.2.sup.0,II
          core. Excepting the resonance for the PF.sub.6 anions at -143
          ppm, the 31P NMR spectrum of 36 in FIG. 17 shows a four-line
          pattern analogous to that observed for the C.sub.s symmetric
          complexes 35-L. The axial phosphorus of the chelating tfepma
          ligand is observed as a singlet at 28 ppm, whereas the
          equatorial phosphorus is observed at 50 ppm as a triplet
          displaying a .sup.2 J.sub.PP coupling constant of 273 Hz to
          the doublet at 89 ppm for the Ir.sup.0 phosphorus atoms of the
          bridging tfepma ligands. Finally, the Ir.sup.II phosphorus
          atoms give a single resonance at 57 ppm. Similarly, the .sup.1
          H NMR spectrum of 36 displays two resonances for the tfepma
          methyl groups at 2.83 and 2.70 ppm, the 2:1 integration ratio
          is consistent with the expected bridging/chelating
          coordination mode. Complete exchange of the MeCN ligands
          occurs upon dissolution of the solid as evidenced by a singlet
          at 1.96 ppm for uncoordinated MeCN. Single crystals
          diffraction analysis of the product confirm the preservation
          of the Ir.sub.2.sup.0,II core as depicted in FIG. 17. For
          comparison purposes, the metric parameters for the core of 36
          are presented in Table 13 alongside those of Ir.sub.2.sup.0,11
          complexes 34 and 35-L. Removal of the halogen ligands results
          in a contracted metal-metal separation of 2.7805(7) .ANG., as
          well as a shorter axial Ir.sup.0 --P bond. Conversely, whereas
          the equatorial Ir.sup.0 --P bond distances are similar in
          34-36, the Ir.sup.II --P distances are elongated by nearly
          0.02 .ANG. in 36. </p>

            (tfepma).sub.3 Cl.sub.2</b> </p>
        <p><b>Chlorine Addition to 3 (iv and v of Scheme 11)</b> </p>
        <p>Chlorine, in the form of its iodobenzene adduct, facilely
          adds to 33 to give the two-electron mixed-valence complex
          Ir.sub.2 I,III (tfepma).sub.3 Cl4 (37) as shown in reaction
          (iv) of Scheme 11. X-ray crystallographic studies on single
          crystals of 37 yielded the molecular structure depicted in
          FIG. 18(a). Halogen addition occurs across the metal-metal
          bond of 33. The Ir--Ir distance of 2.7765(8) .ANG. (Table 14)
          is well within the range for a metal-metal bond. Simple
          electron counting arguments are consistent with the
          formulation of an Ir.sup.I.fwdarw.Ir.sup.III dative bond where
          both metals assume octahedral coordination geometry. The
          octahedral metal centers of 37 are rotated with respect to one
          another by an average value of 32.degree.. The Ir.sup.III --Cl
          bonds are noticeably longer than those for the reduced
          Ir.sub.2.sup.0,II complexes, at an average value of 2.446(4)
          .ANG.. This result is peculiar in light of the anticipated
          contraction of the iridium radius upon oxidation of Ir.sup.II
          to Ir.sup.III. The coordination of the bridging tfepma ligands
          is unchanged from 33; however, the Ir--P distances associated
          with the chelating ligand elongate by .about.0.1 .ANG.. </p>
        <p>NMR spectra of 37 are consistent with the octahedral
          coordination geometry of the oxidized metal core. The distinct
          environments of a chelating and two bridging ligands are
          signified by ligand methyl resonances in the .sup.1 H NMR
          spectrum at 2.71 ppm and 2.88 and 2.93 ppm, respectively. The
          .sup.31 P{.sup.1 H} NMR spectrum of 37 consists of six
          separate resonances, one for each of the unique phosphites
          under C.sub.1 symmetry. Referring to the numbering scheme of
          FIG. 18(a), P(3) and P(5) are expected to be strongly coupled
          owing to their trans arrangement. In this context, signals at
          13.14 and 74.31 ppm are ascribed to P(5) and P(3),
          respectively, based on a .sup.2 J.sub.PP coupling constant of
          901 Hz. As in the reduced Ir.sub.2.sup.0,II complexes, a low
          frequency resonance at 9.24 ppm is attributed to the P(6)
          phosphite trans to the Ir--Ir bond. Based on the .sup.31 P
          COSY spectrum of 37, the 66.46-ppm resonance is ascribed to
          the Ir.sup.I -bound P(1) phosphite of the bridging ligand,
          while the signals at 54.98 and 57.11 ppm are assigned to
          Ir.sup.III -bound P(2) and P(4) phosphites of the bridging
          ligands, respectively. </p>

          (tfepma).sub.2 Cl.sub.4 (MeCN).sub.2 (38), and possessing
          relatively simple NMR spectra, is obtained. The .sup.1 H NMR

          four methylene resonances between 4.48 and 5.46 ppm for the

          of free ligand indicating that the bound solvent molecule is
          exchanged immediately upon dissolution of solid samples of the

          resonances at 54.97 and 57.87 ppm with a simple AA'BB'
          coupling pattern. These NMR results point towards a symmetric
          complex, which is verified by X-ray diffraction studies (FIG.
          18(b)). Two bridging cis-diphosphazane ligands span a
          valence-symmetric Ir.sub.2.sup.II,II core supporting
          octahedral coordination geometries that are related to each
          other by a 30.degree. twist about the Ir--Ir axis. A
          metal-metal bond distance of 2.7525(9) .ANG. signifies a
          formal bonding interaction that is characteristic of a d.sup.7
          --d.sup.7 complexes. Each metal center is coordinated by one
          equatorial and one axial chloride ligand, leaving acetonitrile
          to complete the octahedral coordination spheres of the metal
          centers. The Ir--P bond distances average 2.206(5) .ANG., and
          the Ir--Cl bond distances are 2.432(5) and 2.476(5) .ANG. for
          the equatorial and axial halogens, respectively. </p>
        <p>The lability of the acetonitrile ligands suggested that their

          bridging ligands, similar to that observed for the chemistry
          of rhodium with dfpma and tfepma. Addition of one equivalent
          of tfepma to solutions of 38 in CH.sub.2 Cl.sub.2, however,
          leads to nearly quantitative (&gt;90%) conversion to the

          the IR spectrum at 2115 cm.sup.-1 is consistent with the
          presence of a terminal hydride ligand situated trans to a
          phosphorus atom. FIG. 19 displays the results of single
          crystal X-ray data analysis of 40 as a thermal ellipsoid plot;
          selected bond distances and angles are listed in Table 14. As
          observed in the halogen addition reaction, a metal-metal
          separation of 2.7775(11) .ANG. is consistent with an
          Ir.sup.I.fwdarw.Ir.sup.III formulation containing a dative
          bond. Interestingly, the octahedral metal centers are nearly
          eclipsed with an average torsion angle of only 14.degree.. A
          conspicuously vacant site in the X-ray crystal structure of 40
          confirms the location of the hydride in the equatorial plane
          of the Ir.sup.I center (P(3)-Ir(1)-P(5)=153.90(7).degree. and
          P(6)-Ir(1)-Ir(2)=167.41(6).degree.). Moreover, subsequent to
          the location of all non-hydrogen atoms, the Fourier difference
          map showed a single peak in the vacant iridium coordination
          site of appropriate intensity for a hydride ligand though the
          proximity of the hydride to a heavy nucleus precludes the
          determination of an accurate Ir--H distance. Further evidence
          for the hydride location comes from the elongated Ir(1)-P(1)
          bond distance, resulting from the strong trans influence of
          the hydride ligand. The Ir(1)-P(1) bond distance of 2.314(2)
          .ANG. is 0.091(3) .ANG. longer than that of observed in the
          chloride analog 37. Excluding Ir(1)-P(1), all other
          metal-ligand bond distances of 40 are similar to those
          observed in 37. </p>
        <p>The results of NMR spectroscopy are consistent with the X-ray
          structural studies. A single hydride resonance is observed in
          the .sup.1 H NMR spectrum of 40 (FIG. 20(a)) at -10.24 ppm. A
          178 Hz .sup.2 J.sub.PH coupling constant confirms the
          coordination of a phosphorus trans to the hydride is
          maintained in solution. The three different tfepma ligand
          environments are distinguished in the .sup.1 H NMR spectrum by
          unique methyl resonances at 2.65, 2.77 and 2.89 ppm. .sup.31
          P-.sup.1 H HMQC experiments were used to assign a .sup.31 P
          NMR resonance at 86.4 ppm as the Ir.sup.I phosphite
          coordinated trans to the hydride ligand. The high frequency
          shift of this resonance follows from the strong trans
          influence of the hydride ligand observed in the solid-state
          structure. Two resonances at 64.4 and 67.8 ppm in the .sup.31
          P NMR spectrum are assigned to Ir.sup.III phosphites, whereas
          the low frequency singlet at 21.6 ppm is assigned to the
          axially coordinated phosphite of the chelating ligand. As in
          37, a strong .sup.2 J.sub.PP of 761 Hz observed in resonances
          at 26.6 and 82.2 ppm points to their assignment as the trans
          disposed Ir.sup.I -phosphites of the chelating and bridging
          tfepma ligands, respectively. </p>
        <p>At early reaction times, another isomer of Ir.sub.2
          (tfepma).sub.3 HCl.sub.3 with an axial hydride ligand is
          observed (39 in Scheme 11). As indicated by reactions (vi) and
          (vii) of Scheme 11, 39 converts to 40 upon stirring in
          CH.sub.2 Cl.sub.2. Examination of the Ir--H stretching region
          of the IR spectrum gives a single stretch at 2037 cm.sup.1,
          and the .sup.1 H NMR spectrum of 39 shown in FIG. 20(b) shows
          a single hydride resonance at -13.0 ppm. The absence of a
          large .sup.2 J.sub.PH coupling in the low frequency resonance
          suggests only cis H,P interactions, requiring protonation to
          occur at the axial coordination site of either the Ir.sup.0 or
          Ir.sup.II center. The .sup.31 P NMR spectrum of 39 shows
          strong .sup.2 J.sub.PP couplings of 795 and 752 Hz in both the
          35.7 and 47.9-ppm resonances of the chelating phosphite,
          respectively. Moreover, the resonances for the other Ir.sup.I
          phosphites at 80.9 and 88.7 ppm show the same 795 and 752 Hz
          coupling constants. Finally, the chemical shifts and coupling
          patterns of the Ir.sup.III -coordinated phosphites at 63.8 and
          66.3 ppm suggest an Ir.sup.III center equivalent to that
          observed in the final product 40. These NMR data suggest the
          reaction sequence shown in Scheme 11. </p>
        <p>In order to elucidate further the initial steps of acid
          addition to 33, the protonation reaction was studied with the
          acids of non-coordinating anions. Addition of neat triflic
          acid to suspensions of 33 in CH.sub.2 Cl.sub.2 yields no
          appreciable reaction, even after 24 h, in stark contrast to
          the instantaneous addition of HCl to suspensions of 33.
          However, if the triflic acid is added as a solution in MeCN,
          rapid dissolution of the solid occurs to give a pale yellow,
          almost colorless solution from which a pale yellow solid
          precipitates. Spectroscopic studies suggest the formulation
          Ir.sub.2.sup.I,III (tfepma).sub.3 HCl.sub.2 (MeCN) (41) with a
          structure analogous to 39 as shown in reaction viii of Scheme
          11. The presence of a hydride ligand is indicated by an Ir--H
          stretching mode at 2042 cm.sup.-1 in the infrared spectrum of
          the product as well as a single low frequency hydride
          resonance at -12.67 ppm (FIG. 20(c)) in the .sup.1 H NMR
          spectrum. The .sup.31 P NMR spectrum of 41 shows other
          similarities to 39. Two pairs of strongly coupled phosphite
          signals are observed: resonances at 43.0 and 48.4 ppm can be
          assigned to the chelating tfepma ligand coordinated to
          Ir.sup.I with .sup.2 J.sub.PP coupling constants of 740 and
          720 Hz, respectively, reflected in the resonances for the
          other Ir.sup.I phosphites at 75.9 and 85.0 ppm. Two remaining
          peaks at 53.6 and 66.9 ppm are in the range for phosphites at
          the Ir.sup.III center. In this case the low frequency shift of
          the former resonance results from coordination of an
          acetonitrile molecule across the Ir.sup.III center as observed
          for 33 in solution. </p>
        <p>As observed for 33, the MeCN ligand of 41 undergoes exchange
          in CD.sub.3 CN solvent. The disappearance of the coordinated
          MeCN signal is complemented by the appearance of a signal for
          free MeCN at 1.96 ppm. The exchange process is sufficiently
          slow such that the loss in intensity of the .sup.1 H resonance
          of the Ir.sup.III -coordinated MeCN may be easily monitored
          over the course of a day. A plot of In I vs t is linear
          (R.sup.2 =0.9984), yielding a first-order decay rate constant
          of k.sub.H =1.25.times.10.sup.-4 s.sup.-1. Interestingly, the
          MeCN exchange process is significantly accelerated (k.sub.D
          =1.90.times.10.sup.-4 sec.sup.-1, R.sup.2 =0.9985) when 33 is
          deuterated by DOTf, yielding an inverse kinetic isotope effect
          of 0.66. </p>
        <p><b>Reversible H.sub.2 Addition to 33 (ix of Scheme 11)</b> </p>
        <p>Hydrogen adds to 3 with equal facility to the X.sub.2 and HX.
          Suspensions of 3 in CH.sub.2 Cl.sub.2 rapidly afford a pale
          yellow solution upon bubbling with hydrogen gas at room
          temperature to yield Ir.sub.2 I.sup.,III (tfepma).sub.3
          H.sub.2 Cl.sub.2 (42) as shown in reaction (ix) of Scheme 11.
          The reaction can be reversed with N.sub.2 purging. Two
          iridium-hydride resonances appear in the low frequency region
          of the .sup.1 H NMR spectrum at -11.51 and -8.32 ppm signaling
          H.sub.2 addition to the Ir.sub.2.sup.0,II core. FIG. 20(d)
          reveals large .sup.2 J.sub.PH coupling constants in both
          hydride resonances of 42. A coupling constant of 172 Hz in the
          low frequency doublet is commensurate with the 178 Hz coupling
          constant observed for the Ir.sup.I hydride in the equatorial
          isomer of 40. An even larger .sup.2 J.sub.PH coupling constant
          of 270 Hz observed in the -8.32 ppm resonance points toward an
          equatorial hydride ligand at the Ir.sup.III center, where the
          contracted radius of the oxidized metal center leads to an
          even larger coupling constant to a trans phosphorus. The
          .sup.31 P NMR spectrum of 42 shows a six-resonance pattern
          similar to those observed for complexes 37 and 40, supporting
          the Ir.sub.2.sup.I,III (tfepma).sub.3 H.sub.2 Cl.sub.2
          formulation. The chelating ligand resonances appear shifted to
          low frequency as a doublet-of-triplets at 17.8 ppm and a
          strongly coupled doublet at 45.3 ppm (2J.sub.PP =750 Hz). This
          750-Hz coupling constant is mirrored in a resonance at 95.5
          ppm, easily identifying this resonance as an Irl-phosphite
          from a bridging tfepma ligand. .sup.31 P-.sup.1 H HMQC
          experiments provided coupling-correlation of the .sup.31 P NMR
          resonances at 86.8 ppm and 99.4 ppm to the Ir.sup.III and
          Ir.sup.I -coordinated hydrides, respectively. A peak at 71.3
          ppm is assigned to the remaining Ir.sup.III phosphite, located
          trans to a chloride ligand. </p>
        <p>Oxidative addition of hydrogen across the diiridium bond to
          give a HIr.sup.I.fwdarw.Ir.sup.III Cl.sub.2 H core is
          confirmed by the X-ray crystal structure of Ir.sub.2.sup.I,III
          (tfepma).sub.3 H.sub.2 Cl .sub.2 shown in FIG. 21; selected
          bond distances and angles are presented in Table 14. Though
          the Ir.sup.III -coordinated hydride could not reliably be
          located (the Ir.sup.I -coordinated hydride was located in the
          difference Fourier map), the vacant coordination sites of each
          octahedral ligand sphere establishes the location of the
          hydride ligands (P(5)-Ir(1)-P(3)=168.72(12),
          P(6)-Ir(1)-Ir(2)=158.46(10) and P(2)-Ir(2)-Cl(2)=169.35(12)
          Cl(4)-Ir(2)-Ir(1)=176.35(8)). Furthermore, the Ir(1)-P(1) and
          Ir(2)-P(4) bond distances of 2.300(3) and 2.277(3) .ANG. are
          significantly longer than the same distances in
          Ir.sub.2.sup.I,III (tfepma).sub.3 Cl.sub.4, in accord with the
          trans influence associated with the terminal hydride ligands.
          The average twist angle about the Ir--Ir bond axis is only
          10.degree.; the H(1)-Ir(1)-Ir(2)-H(2) dihedral angle in the
          solid state is 88.degree.. The diiridium bond distance is
          significantly shorter at 2.7561(7) .ANG. than those observed
          in Ir.sub.2.sup.I,III complexes Ir.sub.2.sup.I,III
          (tfepma).sub.3 Cl.sub.4 and Ir.sub.2.sup.I,III (tfepma).sub.3
          HCl.sub.3, and in fact is more comparable to the bond distance
          observed in the Ir.sub.2.sup.II,II complex, Ir.sub.2.sup.II,II
          (tfepma).sub.2 Cl.sub.2 (MeCN).sub.2. Other metrical
          parameters of Ir.sub.2.sup.I,III (tfepma).sub.3 H.sub.2
          Cl.sub.2 are largely unchanged from the other
          Ir.sub.2.sup.I,III complexes. </p>
        <p>The equilibrium isotope effect may be evaluated for hydrogen
          addition to 33 according to reaction (ix) of Scheme 11.
          Addition of 1 atm of an equimolar mixture of H.sub.2 and
          D.sub.2 to an NMR tube containing 33 in d.sup.8 -THF results
          in the rapid color change to yellow associated with hydrogen
          addition. Integration of the .sup.1 H NMR spectrum after
          .about.30 min yielded a ratio of 42 to 42-d.sub.2 of
          0.90.+-.0.05. The ratio remained constant for several hours,
          until significant HID exchange prevented further measurements.
        </p>
        <p>The .sup.1 H NMR spectrum of 42 in d.sup.8 -THF was observed
          to evolve slowly for several days. Heating accelerates this
          reaction; d.sup.8 -THF solutions of 42 heated to 80.degree. C.
          under an H.sub.2 atmosphere are converted to new products as
          evidenced by .sup.1 H and .sup.31 P NMR spectroscopy. An
          integration ratio of nine methyl protons of three tfepma
          ligands to two hydride ligands suggests that no subsequent
          H.sub.2 addition has occurred. Assignment of the reaction
          products is preliminary, but .sup.1 H and .sup.31 P NMR
          suggest the formation of a 1:1 ratio of two major iridium
          hydride products, 43a and 43b depicted in Scheme 12, with the
          same empirical formula as 42. Several overlapping resonances
          in the tfepma methyl and methylene regions precludes their
          utility in making structural assignments. However, the hydride
          region shows four distinct signals at -11.23, -12.63, -13.71
          and -14.07 ppm that account for 90% of 42 (additional smaller
          peaks are observed at -12.85 and -13.78 ppm). The three high
          frequency hydride resonances show .sup.2 J.sub.HP coupling
          constants diagnostic of hydride coordination trans to a
          phosphorus ligand: .sup.2 J.sub.HP =184, 177 and 181 Hz,
          respectively. The low frequency, -14.07-ppm ##STR12## </p>
        <p>resonance is an apparent quartet with only C is .sup.2
          J.sub.HP couplings. The .sup.31 P{.sup.1 H} NMR spectrum
          confirms the presence of two principal reaction products by
          the appearance of twelve distinct phosphorus resonances (as
          discussed above, the Ir.sub.2.sup.I,III complexes 37 and 39-42
          typically show six unique phosphorus environments). </p>
        <p>Assignment of the structure for 43a begins with the
          diagnostic pair of resonances observed in the 31P NMR spectrum
          for a chelating tfepma ligand at 41.7 and 59.0 ppm, with the
          former displaying a 692 Hz coupling constant. This .sup.2
          J.sub.PP coupling is reflected in a high frequency resonance
          at 99.9 ppm, confirming a trans phosphite arrangement on an
          Ir.sup.I center. The chemical shift of the -11.23-ppm hydride
          resonance is consistent with the chemical shift of the
          equivalent Ir.sup.I hydride of 32. Selective decoupling
          experiments show strong correlation between this and a .sup.31
          P resonance at 85.8 ppm; a .sup.2 J.sub.HP -coupling constant
          of 184 Hz is also congruent with the coupling constant for the
          same hydride-phosphite pair in 42. .sup.2 J.sub.PP couplings
          observed in the 99.9 and 85.8-ppm 31p resonances are reflected
          in resonances at 72.5 and 63.6 ppm, respectively, and are
          characteristic of phosphorus-phosphorus couplings through the
          nitrogen bridgehead of the tfepma ligand. Finally, equatorial
          chlorides and an axial hydride (-14.07 ppm) complete the
          Ir.sup.III coordination sphere; the axial assignment of the
          hydride is based on the observed high frequency shift of the
          axial Ir.sup.I phosphite singlet to 59.0 ppm. </p>
        <p>Of the twelve phosphorus resonances the remaining six and two
          hydride resonances characterize 13b. Notably, none of the
          .sup.31 P resonances display a large .sup.2 J.sub.PP coupling
          constants, indicating a lack of trans disposed phosphite
          groups, furthermore, both hydride resonances show signature
          .sup.2 J.sub.HP couplings distinctive for a hydride
          coordinated trans to a phosphorus. Based on this evidence, as
          shown in Scheme 2.3, valence disproportionation to yield an
          Ir.sub.2.sup.II,II species is tentatively suggested for 43b.
          In support of this assignment, the chemical shifts and the
          observed phosphorus-hydrogen coupling constants of the hydride
          ligands are not consistent with those observed for the
          Ir.sup.III -hydride ligand of 42 (.delta.=-8.32 ppm, .sup.2
          J.sub.HP= 270 Hz). Furthermore, no low-frequency .sup.31 P
          resonances, characteristic of phosphite coordination to an
          Ir.sup.I center, are observed. </p>
        <p><b>Organometallic Aspects of Two-Electron Mixed-Valence
            Reactivity</b> </p>
        <p>The reactivity of Ir.sub.2.sup.0,II (tfepma).sub.3 Cl.sub.2
          with dihydrogen provided the impetus for investigating the
          organometallic chemistry of the two-electron mixed-valence
          platform. Preliminary experiments indicate that alkyl
          derivatives of 33 can be prepared, and that the
          Ir.sub.2.sup.0,II core is maintained. Treatment of 33 with one
          equiv of methide source MeMgBr or MeLi at low temperature in
          THF results in a color change from brown to yellow. Upon
          warming to room temperature the color returns to brown.
          Solvent removal followed by trituration with CH.sub.2 Cl.sub.2
          affords a gray-green powder in moderate yield. The 31P NMR
          reveals six different phosphorus environments consistent with
          the solution structure shown in reaction (x) of Scheme 11 for
          Ir.sub.2.sup.0,II (tfepma).sub.3 (Me)Cl(MeCN) (44). A singlet
          is observed at 29.5 ppm for the axial Ir.sup.0 phosphite, with
          the typical pseudo-triplet at 44.8 ppm for the equatorial
          Ir.sup.0 phosphite of the chelating tfepma ligand. The
          equatorial Ir.sup.0 phosphites of the bridging tfepma ligands
          appear as two doublets-of-multiplets at 93.8 and 95.5 ppm. One
          Ir.sup.II phosphite is observed at 72.5 ppm with the second
          shifted to high frequency at 109.3 ppm. The .sup.1 H NMR in
          CD.sub.3 CN reveals a doublet-of-doublets resonance at 1.11
          ppm that integrates to three protons. Selective .sup.31 P
          decoupling gives a .sup.3 J.sub.HP coupling constant of 8.1 Hz
          to the high frequency, 109.3 ppm, phosphite resonance and a
          .sup.3 J.sub.HP coupling constant of 2.8 Hz to the 72.5 ppm
          phosphite resonance, establishing the equatorial coordination
          of a methyl group on the Ir.sup.II center. Coordination of a
          solvent molecule is confirmed by the presence of precisely one
          equivalent of free THF or MeCN in the .sup.1 H NMR spectrum of
          thoroughly dried compound. </p>
        <p>The preparation of two-electron mixed-valence complexes of
          iridium would seem to follow directly from studies of the
          Rh.sub.2.sup.0,II platform. However, the stronger metal-ligand
          bonds of iridium starting materials do not permit
          methodologies used in the rhodium chemistry described above to
          translate to iridium. In order to isolate binuclear complexes
          of the dfpma ligand with iridium, excess oxidant must be
          employed to react with 1,5-cyclooctadiene liberated during the
          reaction. Nevertheless, the Ir.sup.I center of 31 maintains a
          chelated 1,5-cyclooctadiene ligand, presumably because the
          poor .sigma.-donor ligand dfpma cannot displace it from the
          iridium coordination sphere. Dppma proved to displace
          1,5-cyclooctadiene more efficiently, however, in this case the
          metal core inserts into an aryl C--H bond subsequent to the
          addition of three dppma ligands. Only the low solubility of
          Ir.sub.2.sup.0,II (tfepma).sub.3 Cl.sub.2 (33) in methylene
          chloride permits its isolation in moderate yields, free of the
          1,5-cyclooctadiene byproduct that plagues isolation of other
          diphosphazane derivatives of iridium. Indeed, attempts to
          directly prepare Ir.sub.2.sup.0,II species with an axial
          ligand coordinated to the Ir.sup.II center results in the
          formation of oils that preclude isolation of the
          metal-containing complex. </p>
        <p>The preparation and reactivity of 33 suggests that the
          preferred coordination geometry for iridium maintains a
          .pi.-acid ligand chelated to the low-valent metal center.
          Though steric constraints imposed by the tfepma ligand are
          initially appealing reasons for this structural departure from
          the three bridging ligand motif, the preparation of the
          homologous rhodium series based on the tfepma ligand,
          Rh.sub.2.sup.0,0 (tfepma).sub.3 (L).sub.2, Rh.sub.2.sup.0,II
          (tfepma).sub.3 Cl.sub.2 (L), Rh.sub.2.sup.II,II (tfepma).sub.3
          Cl.sub.4, suggests that three bridging tfepma ligands can be
          accommodated by a binuclear core. Furthermore, coordination of
          tfepma in a chelating mode to the valence symmetric 38
          suggests a thermodynamic preference for a mixed-valence system
          with tfepma chelating the low-valent metal center. </p>
        <p>The reactivity patterns of 33 reveal a complex with
          considerable Lewis acid character. In particular, addition of
          reducible small molecule substrates Cl.sub.2 and HCl proceeds
          with facility. In contrast, MeI, HOTf and MeOTf do not add to
          33 in the absence of suitable donor ligands, suggesting an XY
          addition mechanism in which X.sup.- coordination precedes
          attack by Y.sup.+. The metal-centered frontier molecular
          orbitals for 33, presented in FIG. 22, support this
          contention. A HOMO of mixed d.pi.*/d.delta.* character is
          complemented by a low-energy LUMO of d.sigma.* parentage.
          Coordination of a ligand to the vacant axial site of 33, as in
          the reaction of 33 to 34 or 33 to 35, results in the formation
          of a stable octahedral iridium center, with the
          destabilization of the LUMO providing the required energy
          compensation for bond formation. Similarly, oxidative addition
          of small molecule substrates to 33 leads to occupation of the
          vacant axial site by X.sup.-. Again, destabilization of the
          LUMO attends the formation of the ligand-centered bonding
          orbital. </p>
        <p>The preference of strong .sigma.-donor ligands for the axial
          position of the Ir.sup.II center provides further evidence for
          the Lewis acid character of the bimetallic core. Ligands with
          .sigma.-donor properties stronger than chloride coordinate to
          the Ir.sup.II center opposite the M-M bond whereas the weaker
          donor ligands are forced into equatorial positions with
          concomitant chloride migration to the axial site. No
          spectroscopic evidence for equatorial coordination was
          observed among the series CNR, PR.sub.3, Br.sup.-. Conversely,
          THF and MeCN were observed to coordinate only in the
          equatorial position. These results are in contradistinction to
          other studies on binuclear metal complexes that preferentially
          coordinate the weakest .sigma.-donor opposite the metal-metal
          bond. In the present case, the Lewis acid character of the
          d.sigma.* orbital apparently dominates the trans influence
          normally associated with metal-metal bonds. </p>
        <p>The oxidative addition reactivity of 33 is notable in light
          of previous studies of two-electron mixed-valence complexes.
          The ability of the tfepma ligand to be sufficiently flexible
          to support the variant coordination geometries and
          correspondent electronic structures of the two-electron
          mixed-valence cores is crucial to the reactivity of Scheme 11.
          In one-electron mixed-valence compounds, a single electron
          change can be accommodated with an inflexible coordination
          sphere; however, this is unlikely to be the case for
          two-electron mixed-valence species. Significant changes in the
          reorganization of the primary coordination environment
          typically accompany the addition or removal of more than one
          electron from a metal center. As Bosnich postulates in his
          studies of 6-4 binucleating complexes, this ligand
          reorganization or "mechanical coupling" between metal centers
          is manifested in arrested multi-electron redox reactivity of
          mixed-valence complexes. In 33, adverse energetics associated
          with mechanical coupling are circumvented by the flexible
          coordination environment offered by the tfepma ligands. The
          three atom diphosphazane backbone can support twist angles
          from 0 to 45.degree., thus permitting the preferred trigonal
          bipyramidal and octahedral coordination geometries of d.sup.9
          and d.sup.7 metal centers, respectively, to be adopted with
          ##STR13## </p>
        <p>facility upon oxidative-addition to the Ir.sub.2.sup.0,II
          bimetallic core. </p>
        <p>The addition of H.sub.2 to 33 and its elimination from 42 is
          an unusual and intriguing observation. There are relatively
          few examples of reversible H.sub.2 addition across metal-metal
          bonds, and in no case, has such a reaction been observed to
          occur reversibly across a preserved metal-metal single bond.
          Variable temperature NMR studies of 33 provide insight into
          the H.sub.2 addition mechanism. The addition of weak 2e.sup.-
          donors to an equatorial Ir.sup.II site of 33, suggests that
          this coordinatively unsaturated metal center is a logical site
          for initial H.sub.2 attack as depicted in Scheme 13. The
          addition of hydrogen to a single metal center of a binuclear
          metal core is consistent with conventional oxidative-addition
          mechanisms; furthermore, Poilblanc and Cowie previously have
          observed single-site H.sub.2 addition followed by hydride
          migration to produce the 1,2-dihydride. Conversely, a
          concerted 1,2 addition of H.sub.2 across a metal-metal bond is
          forbidden by orbital symmetry considerations, as is the
          reverse, reductive elimination. Pre-coordination of dihydrogen
          at Ir.sup.II is further supported by the empirical observation
          that the rate of H.sub.2 addition to 38 decreases with donor
          ability of the solvent, i.e., CH.sub.2 Cl.sub.2
          &gt;THF&gt;MeCN. Presumably, CH.sub.2 Cl.sub.2 cannot compete
          with H.sub.2 as a sufficient donor ligand, whereas THF and
          MeCN show progressively higher Ir-solvent bond dissociation
          energies, slowing the H.sub.2 addition. </p>
        <p>Evaluation of equilibrium isotope effects for the reversible
          addition of H.sub.2 to 33 provides mechanistic support for the
          addition mechanism of Scheme 13. Recent studies suggest that
          inverse EIEs, defined as follows: ##STR14## </p>
        <p>may be characteristic for the concerted addition of H.sub.2
          to a single metal center. For example, an inverse EIE of
          0.70.+-.0.06 was obtained for the coordination of H.sub.2
          versus D.sub.2 in tungsten dihydrogen complexes and an EIE of
          0.63.+-.0.05 was obtained for dihydride/dideuteride formation
          from W(PMe.sub.3).sub.4 I.sub.2. A more thorough experimental
          and theoretical treatment of equilibrium isotope effects for
          the oxidative addition of H.sub.2 to Vaska's complex has been
          reported as well (EIE=0.55.+-.0.06). In order to model
          accurately both the direction and the magnitude of the
          equilibrium isotope effects in the Vaska system, it was
          necessary to use a full statistical mechanics treatment of the
          isotope equilibrium, as given by: </p>
        <p>where SYM is the symmetry number ratio factored from the
          rotational partition function, MMI is EIE component of the
          mass moment of inertia, EXC is the vibrational excitation
          constant and ZPE is the zero point energy term. The first
          three factors describe the entropic element of the
          equilibrium. SYM (1.0), MMI (5.66) and EXC (0.84) components
          for the Vaska system resulted in a normal contribution to the
          isotope effect (i.e., .DELTA.S.degree..sub.H
          -.DELTA.S.degree..sub.D &gt;0), leaving the inverse nature of
          the EIE to be enthalpic (i.e., .DELTA.H.degree..sub.H
          -.DELTA.H.degree..sub.D &gt;0), as reflected by a zero point
          energy term of 0.10. The inverse ZPE term turns out to be a
          special case for hydrogen addition. Though consideration of
          the H--H/D-D bond strength difference (.DELTA.BDE=1.8 kcal
          mol.sup.-1) would suggest a strong normal ZPE contribution,
          this single isotopically sensitive vibrational mode in the
          reactant is dominated by five new isotopically sensitive modes
          in the isotope-containing product (i.e., MH.sub.2 /MD.sub.2).
          In all other equilibrium isotope studies, the number of
          isotopically sensitive modes is essentially the same in
          reactant and product, and as such the value of the equilibrium
          isotope effect is directly determined by the relative
          strengths of the bonds being made and broken. </p>
        <p>A minor inverse equilibrium isotope effect (EIE) of
          0.9.+-.0.05 is observed for the addition of hydrogen versus
          deuterium to 33. This is an interesting result in light of the
          equilibrium isotope effect reported for the reversible
          addition of H.sub.2 to fulvalene dimers of chromium
          (EIE=1.45.+-.0.10). In this latter case, ready access to the
          diradical as shown in Scheme 14 suggests a symmetric addition
          of H.sub.2 across the metal-metal bond, as observed for
          rhodium porphyrin dimers. The pre-equilibrium step to form the
          diradical is not isotope sensitive, thus the EIE reflects only
          the thermodynamic characteristics of the second equilibrium
          step, namely the relative ##STR15## </p>
        <p>stability of H-M . . . M-H/D-M . . . M-D versus H.sub.2
          /D.sub.2. Conversely, the proposed two-step hydrogen addition
          of 33 as depicted in Scheme 13, is characterized by two
          isotope sensitive equilibria: K.sub.1, which is the
          equilibrium for binding and forming the putative dihydrogen
          complex (eq 3), and K.sub.2, which is the equilibrium for
          1,2-hydride migration (eq 4). Substitution of eq 4 into eq 3
          gives K.sub.1.times.K.sub.2 in terms of measurable species,
          i.e., the reactants and the final products (eq 5), which gives
          the relation in eq 6 for the EIE experiment ([H.sub.2
          ]=[D.sub.2 ]). </p>
        <p>It has been proposed that EIEs for hydrogen addition to
          transition metal complexes are general for a given type of
          equilibrium. Thus, referring to eq 4 and 6, the value of
          K.sub.1.sup.H /K.sub.1.sup.D can be approximated by Kubas' EIE
          of 0.70.+-.0.06 for the formation of W(CO).sub.3
          (PCy.sub.3).sub.2 (.eta..sup.2 -H.sub.2) vs W(CO).sub.3
          (PCy.sub.3).sub.2 (.eta..sup.2 -D.sub.2). Similarly it would
          be a reasonable approximation to use Volhardt's EIE of
          1.45.+-.0.10 for the formation of the
          1,2-dihydride/dideuteride of Scheme 14 (K.sub.2.sup.H
          /K.sub.2.sup.D). Though crude, this estimation provides a
          value for (K.sub.1.sup.H /K.sub.1.sup.D)(K.sub.2.sup.H
          /K.sub.2.sup.D) of 1.02, which is in reasonable agreement with
          the measured EIE of 0.9.+-.0.05 for hydrogen/deuterium
          addition to 33, supporting the intermediacy of a dihydrogen
          adduct in the addition mechanism of Scheme 13. </p>
        <p>Isotope effects are also useful in elucidating the solvent
          exchange mechanism of 41. Solutions of 41 in CD.sub.3 CN
          slowly exchange the coordinated acetonitrile ligand, as
          evidenced by decay of the .sup.1 H NMR resonance for the
          coordinated ligand with concomitant growth of free MeCN. At
          20.degree. C. an inverse kinetic isotope effect (KIE) of 0.66
          was measured for this process. Such isotope dependencies have
          been rationalized by invoking product-like transition states
          with higher force constants for isotope-sensitive stretching
          and bending modes. As shown qualitatively in FIG. 23, a
          "tighter" transition state results in a greater difference in
          zero point energy in the transition state relative to the
          ground state, thus .DELTA.G.sup.{character pullout}.sub.H is
          greater than .DELTA.G.sup.{character pullout}.sub.D. Loss of
          the coordinating MeCN ligand followed by rearrangement of the
          Ir.sup.III center to square pyramidal in the transition state
          is expected to strengthen the remaining interactions along the
          metal-metal axis in the transition state. This assumption is
          supported by the contracted Ir(1)-Ir(2) and Ir(1)-P(6) bond
          distances in 33 relative to those of 37 and 40. Thus, a
          one-step solvent exchange process could reasonably give rise
          to an inverse KIE via strengthening of the Ir--H bond in the
          transition state. However, the magnitude of the KIE is
          suspiciously large for a secondary isotope effect. </p>
        <p>Alternatively, the observed inverse KIE could be the result
          of an equilibrium step, prior to actual solvent exchange,
          which exhibits an inverse isotope effect. Consider the
          proposed reaction sequence presented in Scheme 15. Proton
          abstraction from 41 by the weakly basic solvent, in this case
          CD.sub.3 CN (pK.sub.a.congruent.-10), would (in effect) give
          34 and CD.sub.3 CN . . . H.sup.+. The iridium complex could
          then rapidly exchange the coordinated MeCN ligand as
          established by studies of the solution NMR spectra of 33. For
          this situation, the primary isotope effect (the Ir--H bond is
          being broken) arises from the higher force constants
          associated with N--H/D.sup.+ species as opposed to M-H/D.sup.+
          species, resulting in a lower activation barrier for deuterium
          transfer; that is, ##STR16## </p>
        <p>isotopic labeling of the iridium complex favors proton
          transfer to the CD.sub.3 CN solvent. This model is in
          agreement with the arrested reactivity of HOTf with 33 in the
          absence of MeCN; initial coordination of MeCN to 33 to yield
          34 is apparently prerequisite to the protonation yielding 41,
          microscopic reversibility would then require deprotonation of
          41 to occur prior to MeCN exchange. </p>
        <p><b>Summary</b> </p>
        <p>The tfepma ligand presents a novel plafform for binuclear
          iridium chemistry, providing a flexible electronic environment
          and coordination sphere. A two-electron mixed-valence core is
          stabilized by three tfepma ligands in a coordinatively
          unsaturated framework providing easy access to multi-electron
          reactivity. Oxidative addition of small molecule substrates is
          complemented by facile reductive elimination in the case of
          hydrogen, suggesting the binuclear framework to be an
          excellent model complex for the study of stoichiometric and
          catalytic small molecule activation and functionalization. </p>

        <p><b>Reductive Elimination Photochemistry of Rhodium
            Diphosphazanes</b> </p>
        <p>Extending the development of two-electron mixed-valence
          complexes, the viability of promoting multi-electron
          transformations from the excited state of M.sub.2.sup.0,II
          cores was investigated. Excepting H.sub.2 and RH eliminations
          that result in the formation of strong H--H and C--H bonds,
          scant precedent exists for such multi-electron reactivity
          among molecular species. Coupling of individual two-electron
          photoreactions with a Rh.sub.2.sup.0,II complex provides the
          first example of a four-electron photoreaction among discrete
          molecular species. </p>
        <p>Oxidation-reduction reactions of electronically excited
          transition metal complexes customarily proceed by one
          electron. By itself, single electron transfer is confining
          inasmuch as most activation reactions involve multi-electron
          processes. Primary one-electron photoredox events must
          therefore be coupled to oxidation-reduction processes remote
          to the excited state to effect overall multi-electron
          reactivity. Such conformity in multi-electron design finds its
          origins in the nature of the excited state, which at the most
          general level is the same despite the many different types of
          transition metal photoreagents. As instructive examples,
          consider the three systems schematically represented in Scheme
          16. The photochemistry of mononuclear d.sup.6 metals, for
          which tris(bipyridyl)ruthenium(II) is the archetype,
          originates from a metal-to-ligand ##STR17## </p>
        <p>charge transfer (MLCT) excited state in which electrons
          localized on the metal and ligand are triplet-paired. A relay
          catalyst must convey single electron equivalents from the
          metal photosensitizer to a homogeneous or heterogeneous site
          capable of storing multiple redox equivalents. A biradical
          model is also pertinent to the excited state chemistry of
          binuclear d.sup.7(9) and d.sup.8(10) metal complexes, but in
          different guises. The d.sigma.(or d.pi.*)d.sigma.* excited
          states of d.sup.7(9) --d.sup.7(9) complexes are short-lived
          and dissociative, producing an .M,M. biradical pair. Because
          the photogenerated radicals are uncoupled, selective
          multi-electron activation of substrates is difficult to
          control and therefore free radical reactions are typically
          observed Conversely, a stable and long-lived biradical
          tethered by a metal-metal bond, .M-M., is produced upon
          d.sub.z.sub..sup.2 .sigma.*.fwdarw.p.sub.z.sigma. (excitation
          of d.sup.8(10) . . . d.sup.8(10) complexes The proximity of
          the radical metal centers permits coupling of their single
          electron reactions to effect selective multi-electron
          transformations. </p>
        <p>Whereas the general formalism of biradical excited states
          naturally leads to two-electron processes one electron at a
          time, approaches to explore photoredox reactions in excess of
          two electrons are not at hand. In the absence of a
          well-defined framework, it is not surprising to find scant
          precedence for three- and four-electron photoreactions.
          Photoinduced decomposition of Pt.sup.IV salts to metal
          colloids along ill-defined mechanistic pathways is the only
          documented photoredox reaction involving more than two
          electrons. In no case has a four-electron photoreaction along
          a controlled reaction pathway been achieved. </p>
        <p>The challenges confronting the design of multi-electron
          photoreactions are formidable. Reorganization of the primary
          coordination environment typically accompanies the addition or
          removal of more than one electron from a metal center. If
          ligand reorganization does not occur, the thermodynamic
          barrier associated with the transfer of redox equivalents to
          or from the metal center becomes insurmountable at chemically
          relevant redox potentials. This is a particularly germane
          problem for excited state redox schemes because reactivity is
          usually confined to the lowest energy excited state,
          constraining the overall internal energy of the system. As an
          example, again consider the oxidation-reduction chemistry of
          d.sup.6 Ru.sup.II polypyridyl systems. The one-electron
          oxidation and reduction potentials of the Ru.sup.II metal,
          octahedrally coordinated by a conventional polypyridyl ligand
          set, are .about.1.0 to 1.5 V. By virtue of its inflexibility,
          the polypyridine coordination sphere imposes thermodynamic
          remuneration of an additional 1.5 V and 3.3 V for the
          metal-based reduction and oxidation, respectively, of a second
          electron equivalent. An excited state energy of only .about.2
          eV therefore confines reaction to single electron transfer.
          When the coordination environment of the metal is able to
          adopt a geometry to accommodate a two-electron
          photoconversion, the electronic structure responsible for
          excited state reactivity is invariably lost. A lowest energy,
          reactive excited state maintains a fragile existence among the
          multitude of energy-dissipating excited states of a metal
          complex. Changes in coordination geometry will re-order state
          parentages with any one of the neighboring, non-reactive
          states ready to assume the lowest energy position. In this
          case, an excited state pathway encompassing redox reactivity
          beyond two electrons will be circumvented. With these
          considerations in mind, further advances in multi-electron
          photoredox chemistry must require novel molecular structures
          that would preserve the same lowest energy, reactive excited
          state across a multi-electron series of complexes. </p>
        <p>As single-electron mixed-valence compounds react in
          one-electron steps from their excited states, electronically
          excited M.sup.n -M.sup.n+2 complexes may react in two-electron
          steps at the bimetallic core. Although the occurrence of
          authentic M.sup.n -M.sup.n+2 compounds is unusual
          bis(difluorophosphine)methylamine (dfpma) stabilizes a
          four-electron series of Rh.sub.2 complexes based upon the

          dfpma complexes are consistent with each possessing a lowest
          energy excited state of d.sigma.* parentage. The results
          presented herein show that the d.sigma.* excited state permits
          interconversion among Rh.sub.2.sup.0,0, Rh.sub.2.sup.0,II and
          Rh.sub.2.sup.II,II cores, enabling the rational design of a

          spectra for each compound; Table 19 summarizes both absorption
          and emission data for several Rh.sub.2 congeners. The high
          optical electronegativity of the terminal fluorophosphine

          is observed for Rh.sub.2.sup.0,0 (dfpma).sub.3 (L).sub.2. An

          (dfpma).sub.3 X.sub.2 (L) complexes exhibit more congested
          profiles in the near-UV as a result of configurational mixing
          between the metal-d.sub.z.sub..sup.2 and X-p.sub.z .sigma.

          X.sub.2 (L), red-shifting by 3861 cm.sup.-1 upon substitution
          of bromide for chloride. The mid-spectrum band of the
          Rh.sub.2.sup.II,II complex also shows a dramatic 4851
          cm.sup.-1 red-shift upon halogen substitution, however, in the
          Rh.sub.2.sup.0,II complexes this transition appears to be
          equally influenced by the nature of the halogen and the axial
          Rh.sup.0 donor ligand. The low energy absorption band
          red-shifts to a lesser extent upon halogen substitution
          (.about.1254 cm.sup.-1 for Br.sup.- /Cl.sup.-) in both
          Rh.sub.2.sup.II,II and Rh.sub.2.sup.0,II, consistent with

        <p>Whereas substitution of PF3 by .eta..sup.1 -dfpma barely
          perturbs the electronic structure of the dirhodium core,
          coordination of the more basic PR.sub.3 ligands to the
          Rh.sup.0 center of the Rh.sub.2 dfpma series notably disrupts
          the electronic structure of the system. Consistent with the
          perturbation of the Rh--Rh bond distances of the
          Rh.sub.2.sup.0,II (dfpma).sub.3 X.sub.2 (L) complexes
          absorption maxima of complexes with basic phosphines are
          red-shifted by &gt;20 nm relative to those with .pi.-accepting
          fluorophosphines as the axial ligand. The effect is even more
          pronounced in the absorption spectra of the fully reduced
          Rh.sub.2.sup.0,0 (dfpma).sub.3 L.sub.2 compounds containing
          two axially donor ligands. FIG. 26 plots the absorption
          maximum of the d.sigma..fwdarw.d.sigma.* transition of
          Rh.sub.2.sup.0,0 (dfpma).sub.3 L.sub.2 for L=PEt.sub.3,
          P(OMe).sub.3, P(O.sup.i Pr).sub.3, PPh.sub.3 and PF.sub.3 vs
          the Tolman electronic parameterization of phosphine ligands.
          The observed trend of the d.sigma..fwdarw.d.sigma.* transition
          towards lower energy with an increase in the basicity of the
          phosphine logically follows from considerations of P.sigma.
          orbital mixing into the metal-metal .sigma. framework.
          Although linear combinations of P.sigma. orbitals have the
          appropriate symmetries to mix with both d.sigma. and
          d.sigma.*, destabilization of the energetically proximate do
          orbital will be greater, resulting in the observed red shift.
          With the exception of PPh.sub.3, the size of the phosphine is
          of little consequence in the overall correlation since the
          cone angles of the phosphines are relatively constricted
          (&lt;135.degree.). The anomalously small
          d.sigma..fwdarw.d.sigma.* transition energy of PPh.sub.3 is
          attributed to structural distortions of the ligand and metal
          framework. Steric-induced lengthening of the Rh--Rh bond by
          PPh.sub.3 augments the ligand's electronic effect, leading to
          a smaller d.sigma./d.sigma.d* splitting and consequently lower
          observed transition energy than that predicted by the Tolman
          electronic parameter. </p>
        <p>Excitation into the absorption manifold of crystalline solids
          of the Rh.sub.2 dfpma compounds produces a long-lived red
          luminescence with spectral features characteristic of a
          d.sigma.* excited state parentage. Luminescence is not
          detected from solutions at temperatures equivalent to those at
          which the crystalline solids emit. Moreover, the loss of
          luminescence from solutions of the Rh.sub.2 dfpma complexes
          immediately above solvent glassing transition temperatures
          suggested a prevalence for bond cleavage chemistry as a
          dominant nonradiative decay pathway of the d.sigma.* excited
          state. These photophysical observations provided the impetus
          to undertake investigations of the solution photochemistry of
          this series of complexes. </p>

          during photolysis, are lost with continued irradiation,
          indicating the occurrence of a secondary reaction at longer
          times. Comparison of the terminating absorption profile of the
          photolyzed solution to the absorption spectra of FIG. 25(a)
          identifies the final photoproduct as Rh.sub.2.sup.0,0
          (dfpma).sub.3 (.eta..sup.1 -dfpma).sub.2. Independent
          verification of this assignment was afforded by bulk
          photolysis experiments. Irradiation of Rh.sub.2.sup.II,II
          (dfpma).sub.3 Br.sub.4 in the presence of .eta..sup.1 -dfpma
          in THF followed by solvent removal yielded the final product,
          which was extracted into pentane. Recrystallization at low
          temperature afforded Rh.sub.2.sup.0,0 (dfpma).sub.3
          (.eta..sup.1 -dfpma).sub.2 as determined by the .sup.19 F NMR
          spectrum reproduced in FIG. 28. Three .sup.19 F NMR resonances
          are observed in a 1:3:1 ratio. A doublet at -40.96 ppm
          displaying a .vertline..sup.1 J.sub.FP +.sup.3
          J.sub.FP.vertline. coupling constant of 1117 Hz identifies the

          and -76.29 ppm (.vertline..sup.1 J.sub.FP +.sup.3
          J.sub.FP.vertline.=1253 Hz) are assigned to the coordinated

          is carried out in the presence of excess PF.sub.3 : the final

          Br.sub.2 (.eta..sup.1 -dfpma) complexes, wavelength selection
          of the excitation light permitted deconstruction of the
          overall photo transformation of FIG. 27 into a stepwise
          reaction sequence. Though solutions of Rh.sub.2.sup.II,II
          (dfpma).sub.3 Br.sub.4 in THF are stable in the absence of
          irradiation, FIG. 29(a) displays the changes in the absorption
          profile upon photolysis at .lambda..sub.exc.gtoreq.436 nm.
          Well-anchored isosbestic points are maintained throughout the
          photolysis. Comparison of the terminating absorption spectrum
          to those of FIG. 25(b) reveals that Rh.sub.2.sup.0,II
          (dfpma).sub.3 Br.sub.2 (.eta..sup.1 -dfpma) is the
          photoproduct. On the basis of the measured molar absorption
          coefficients, the photoconversion of the Rh.sub.2.sup.II,II
          complex to the mixed-valence Rh.sub.2.sup.0,II complex is
          quantitative. Although this photoreacted solution is stable
          under the low-energy excitation conditions of FIG. 29(a),
          further reaction is observed when the excitation wavelength is
          moved into the UV spectral region. As shown in FIG. 29(b), the
          final absorption spectrum of the solution under 335-nm
          irradiation is that of Rh.sub.2.sup.0,0 (dfpma).sub.3
          (.eta..sup.1 -dfpma).sub.2, which is also produced in
          quantitative yield. These results demonstrate that the overall
          photoreaction proceeds in two steps: Rh.sub.2.sup.II,II
          (dfpma).sub.3 Br.sub.4 is photolyzed to Rh.sub.2.sup.0,II
          (dfpma).sub.3 Br.sub.2 (.eta..sup.1 -dfpma) for
          .lambda..sub.exc.gtoreq.436 nm and subsequently
          Rh.sub.2.sup.0,II (dfpma).sub.3 Br.sub.2 (.eta..sup.1 -dfpma)
          is photolyzed to Rh.sub.2.sup.0,0 (dfpma).sub.3 (.eta..sup.1
          -dfpma).sub.2 for .lambda..sub.exc.gtoreq.335 nm. </p>
        <p>In the absence of a donor ligand to cap the reduced Rh.sup.0
          center during irradiation of Rh.sub.2.sup.II,II complexes, an
          intermediate species is observed at early reaction times (FIG.
          30). Photolysis of Rh.sub.2.sup.II,II (dfpma).sub.3 Br.sub.4
          in THF without any donor ligand causes a rapid color change of
          the solution to blue. The color results from the appearance of
          a new absorbance in the visible region of the spectrum at 583
          nm. Comparison of the maximum intensity of the 583-nm band
          with the absorption bands of the starting Rh.sub.2.sup.II,II
          (dfpma).sub.3 Br.sub.4 complex provides a crude estimate of
          4000 M.sup.-1 cm.sup.-1 as the extinction coefficient of this
          583-nm band. If the solutions are maintained in the dark, the
          blue color fades within minutes, and the observed absorption
          spectrum shows only bands in the near UV region of the
          spectrum attributable to the Rh.sub.2.sup.0,II photoproduct. </p>
        <p><b>Identification of the Halogen Photoproduct</b> </p>
        <p>The fate of the halogen in the overall photoreaction sequence
          is disclosed by undertaking the appropriate trapping
          experiments. Because the weak .alpha. C--H bonds of THF are
          susceptible to hydrogen atom abstraction, THF could
          participate in the photoreaction as a halogen trap. Two
          observations support this contention. No photoreaction is
          observed in benzene or CH.sub.2 Cl.sub.2 unless a halogen trap
          such as 2,3-dimethyl-1,3-butadiene or 9,10-dihydroanthracene
          is present. The inability of these solvents to furnish a
          hydrogen atom appears to circumvent net photochemistry as the
          halogen photoproduct can simply re-oxidize the reduced metal
          center. Conversely, photoreactions in THF proceed with
          facility regardless of the concentration of auxiliary trapping
          reagent. Addition of 2,3-dimethyl-1,3-butadiene or
          9,10-dihydroanthracene to THF solutions of Rh.sub.2.sup.II,II
          (dfpma).sub.3 X.sub.4 or Rh.sub.2.sup.0,II (dfpma).sub.3
          X.sub.2 (.eta..sup.1 -dfpma) has little affect on the overall
          conversion efficiency. Considering the high concentration of
          neat solvent, auxiliary traps cannot effectively compete for
          the halogen photoproduct and thus its presence has little
          affect on the outcome of the photochemistry performed in THF.
        </p>
        <p>If hydrogen atom abstraction from THF does occur, the
          ultimate fate of the Br photoproduct should be HX (X=Cl, Br).
          The conditions under which the above photolyses reactions were
          executed, however, preclude detection of hydrohalic acids.
          Because hydrohalic acids readily hydrolyze the N--P bond of
          F.sub.2 PNR.sub.2 to form [H.sub.2 NR.sub.2 ].sup.+ X.sup.-
          (and PF.sub.2 X), the acid photoproducts would be scavenged by
          the excess dfpma present under photolytic conditions, thus
          preventing its stoichiometric determination. Accordingly, the
          dirhodium photochemistry was investigated in the presence of
          PPh.sub.3, as this phosphine effectively coordinates reduced
          Rh.sup.0 centers and also offers suitable hydrolytic
          stability. </p>
        <p>The photochemistry of Rh.sub.2.sup.II,II (dfpma).sub.3
          Br.sub.4 in the presence of excess PPh.sub.3 proceeds
          according to the same two-step reaction sequence that was
          described for dfpma with the minor difficulty that
          Rh.sub.2.sup.0,II (dfpma).sub.3 Br.sub.2 (PPh.sub.3) can not
          be cleanly produced by wavelength selection. As listed in
          Table 19, the middle-energy
          X(.sigma.)/d.sigma..fwdarw.(d.sigma.* transition of
          Rh.sub.2.sup.0,II (dfpma).sub.3 Br.sub.2 (PPh.sub.3) is
          observed at 371 nm. The red-shifted LMCT transition tails
          significantly into the visible spectral region such that the
          436-nm excitation wavelength used to photoconvert
          Rh.sub.2.sup.II,II (dfpma).sub.3 Br.sub.4 to Rh.sub.2.sup.0,II
          (dfpma).sub.3 Br.sub.2 (PPh.sub.3) is also sufficiently
          energetic to slowly convert Rh.sub.2.sup.0,II (dfpma).sub.3
          Br.sub.2 (PPh.sub.3), as it is produced, to Rh.sub.2.sup.0,0
          (dfpma).sub.3 (PPh.sub.3).sub.2. Despite experimental
          complexity, the PPh.sub.3 system is ideal for quantifying the
          HBr produced from the overall photoreaction sequence.
          Quantification of HBr was indirectly determined by its
          reaction with a nitrogen base. The sterically encumbered
          2,6-lutidine proved most useful, as the methyl groups flanking
          the amine prevents competitive coordination of the base to the
          metal center. Thus, bulk photolysis
          (.lambda..sub.exc.gtoreq.335 nm, THF, 0.degree. C.) of
          Rh.sub.2.sup.II,II (dfpma).sub.3 Br.sub.4 (1 equiv, 20
          .mu.mol) was performed in the presence of 2.5 equiv of
          PPh.sub.3 and 4.3 equiv of 2,6-lutidine. After solvent removal
          the solid residue was taken up in CDCl.sub.3, and the .sup.1 H
          NMR spectrum was recorded (FIG. 31). Singlet resonances for
          the methyl groups of the bridging dfpma ligands of
          Rh.sub.2.sup.0,II at 2.83 and 2.91 ppm and of Rh.sub.2 0,0 at
          2.60 ppm distinguish the Rh.sub.2 dfpma photoproducts. A broad
          singlet at 16.8 ppm and sharp singlet at 3.02 ppm are
          signatures of the acid proton and methyl groups, respectively,
          of lutidinium bromide. Integration of the dfpma methyl proton
          signals reveal the production of 0.59 equiv of
          Rh.sub.2.sup.0,II (dfpma).sub.3 Br.sub.2 (PPh.sub.3) and 0.41
          equiv of Rh.sub.2.sup.0,0 (dfpma).sub.3 (PPh.sub.3).sub.2 ;
          the lutidinium bromide resonance integrates to 3.0 equiv. If
          two equiv of HBr are produced for each two-electron
          photoconversion of Rh.sub.2.sup.II,II (dfpma).sub.3 Br.sub.4
          and Rh.sub.2.sup.0,II (dfpma).sub.3 Br.sub.2 (PPh.sub.3), then
          the production of 1.18 and 1.64 equiv of HBr, respectively, or
          total of 2.82 equiv of HBr is required to accompany this
          photolysis reaction. The good agreement between the calculated
          and experimental yields of lutidinium bromide establishes
          Scheme 17 as the overall photoreaction sequence for the
          Rh.sub.2 dfpma system. ##STR18## </p>

        <p><b>Electronic Structure Calculations</b> </p>
        <p>Molecular orbital calculations emphasize the electronic
          structure features that are crucial to promoting the
          four-electron photochemistry of the Rh.sub.2 dfpma series.
          FIG. 32 shows the HOMOs and LUMOs of Rh.sub.2.sup.II,II
          (dfpma).sub.3 Br.sub.4, Rh.sub.2.sup.0,II (dfpma).sub.3
          Br.sub.2 (PF.sub.3), and Rh.sub.2.sup.0,0 (dfpma).sub.3
          (PF.sub.3).sub.2 derived from extended Huckel calculations.
          For each complex, the HOMO is approximately two-fold
          degenerate and of metal d.pi.* or d.delta.* character, while
          the LUMO is primarily localized between the metal centers and
          of .sigma.* character. This homology in the HOMOs and the
          LUMOs is striking considering the disparate metal coordination
          geometries and oxidation states across the Rh.sub.2 dfpma
          series. </p>
        <p>The frontier MOs are largely a consequence of the large
          one-electron splitting arising from the combination of
          spatially directed d.sub.z.sub..sup.2 orbitals of the
          individual fragments composing the Rh.sub.2 dfpma complexes. A
          qualitative molecular orbital diagram for the
          Rh.sub.2.sup.0,0, Rh.sub.2.sup.0,II and Rh.sub.2.sup.II,II
          species, adapted from the extended Hucckel calculations, is
          shown in Scheme 19. Consider the Rh.sup.0 P.sub.4 (C.sub.3v)
          building block of the Rh.sub.2.sup.0,0 (dfpma).sub.3 (L).sub.2
          complex. The fragment has eight electrons residing in
          (d.sub.xz, d.sub.yz) and (d.sub.xy, d.sub.x.sub..sup.2
          .sub.-y.sub..sup.2 ) orbitals and the odd electron occupying
          the d.sub.z.sub..sup.2 orbital. The d.sub.z.sub..sup.2
          orbitals combine to give rise to the d.sigma.* LUMO and a
          filled d.sigma. level, energetically stabilized relative to
          the d.pi./d.pi.*(d.sub.xz, d.sub.yz) and
          d.delta./.delta.*(d.sub.xy, d.sub.x.sub..sup.2
          .sub.-y.sub..sup.2 ) manifold. Thus the HOMO is either d.pi.*
          or d.delta.*, with the former prevailing when two Rh.sup.0
          P.sub.4 fragments are combined, and the formal Rh--Rh single
          bond results from the pairing of the d.sub.z.sub..sup.2
          electrons within the d.sub.z.sub..sup.2 .sigma. level. Similar
          orbital energetics are preserved for the Rh.sub.2.sup.II,II
          (dfpma).sub.3 X.sub.4 and Rh.sub.2.sup.0,II (dfpma).sub.3
          X.sub.2 (L).sub.2 complexes. The d.sub.x.sub..sup.2
          .sub.-y.sub..sup.2 level of the Rh.sup.II P.sub.3 X.sub.2
          fragment is empty and displaced to high energy owing to the
          destabilizing M-L.sub.eq .sigma.* interactions. Consequently,
          as with the Rh.sup.0 P.sub.4 fragment, the odd electron of the
          Rh.sup.II P.sub.3 X.sub.2 fragment resides in the
          d.sub.z.sub..sup.2 orbital, with the remaining six electrons
          of the d.sup.7 metal center occupying the lower energy
          (d.sub.xz, d.sub.yz) and d.sub.xy orbitals. Linear
          combinations of the Rh.sup.II P.sub.3 X.sub.2 fragment
          orbitals with those of another Rh.sup.II P.sub.3 X.sub.2
          fragment to give Rh.sub.2.sup.II,II (dfpma).sub.3 X.sub.4, or
          with those of a Rh.sup.0 P.sub.4 fragment to give
          Rh.sub.2.sup.0,II (dfpma).sub.3 X.sub.2 to a d.sigma.* LUMO.
          As was the situation for Rh.sub.2.sup.0,0 (dfpma).sub.3
          (L).sub.2, the d.sigma. level is stabilized significantly with
          respect to the energetically proximate d.pi.* and d.delta.*
          levels, a result of much smaller one-electron splittings
          engendered by .pi. and .delta. overlap. The only difference
          for the oxidized complexes is that the d.pi.* orbitals (vs
          d.delta.* orbitals in FIG. 32(a)) emerge as the LUMO. Again, a
          single Rh--Rh bond arises from electron pairing within the
          d.sub.z.sub..sup.2 .sigma. orbital. ##STR19## </p>
        <p>The preservation of the metal-metal bond and consequently a
          lowest energy d.sigma.* excited state across the Rh.sub.2
          series is the key to the multi-electron photoreactivity.
          Scheme 19 displays a simplified orbital diagram for the sigma
          manifold along the metal-metal axis of the Rh.sub.2.sup.II,II
          complex based on the extended Huckel results of FIG. 32 and
          Scheme 18. The oxidized Rh.sub.2.sup.II,II and
          Rh.sub.2.sup.0,II compounds are distinguished from their fully
          reduced Rh.sub.2.sup.0,0 counterpart by a charge-transfer
          component associated with promotion of an electron from the
          .sigma.-bonding orbitals (labeled 1a.sub.g and 2a.sub.g in
          Scheme 19) to the .sigma.* LUMO (2a.sub.u). Here, the results
          of the extended Huckel calculation and the observed
          photochemistry converge. Population of the LUMOs of
          Rh.sub.2.sup.II,II and Rh.sub.2.sup.0,II is consistent with
          Rh--X bond homolysis and concomitant one-electron reduction of
          the Rh.sup.II metal center. Moreover, a stepwise process for
          the reductive elimination of bromine is suggested by the nodal
          structure of the LUMOs. The localization of antibonding
          character along the metal-metal internuclear axis points
          towards the initial activation of the Rh--X.sub.ax bond.

        <p><b>Discussion</b> </p>
        <p>As one-electron mixed-valence bimetallic cores promote single
          electron transfer reactions, the results presented here show
          that two-electron mixed-valence cores can support two-electron
          redox pathways, affording a framework in which to rationally
          design multi-electron reactivity. The metal-metal bonded
          Rh.sub.2.sup.0,II complex sustains the multi-electron
          reactivity of the Rh.sub.2 dfpma system by coupling
          two-electron reduced Rh.sub.2.sup.0,0 and two-electron
          oxidized Rh.sub.2.sup.II,II species. </p>
        <p>The thermodynamic driving force imparted by Rh--Rh bond
          formation (BDE=32.+-.4 kcal mol.sup.-1) precludes the
          stabilization of one-electron intermediates that would
          short-circuit multi-electron reactivity. Photon absorption
          into the X(.sigma.)/d.sigma..fwdarw.d.sigma.* manifold of
          Rh.sub.2.sup.II,II complexes prompts activation of an axial
          Rh--X bond leading to one-electron reduction of the bimetallic
          core and elimination of the halogen. Two unimolecular pathways
          from the one electron intermediate can afford the observed
          Rh.sub.2.sup.0,II (dfpma).sub.3 X.sub.2 (L) photoproduct.
          Reductive cleavage of the equatorial Rh.sup.I --X bond of the
          initial photoproduct would directly yield the reduced metal
          center (Scheme 20, top pathway). Coordination of a donor
          ligand would then give the Rh.sub.2.sup.0,II (dfpma).sub.3
          X.sub.2 (L) product. Alternatively, the orbital diagram of
          Scheme 19 implies that ejection of the remaining axial halogen
          might occur rapidly. As shown in the bottom pathway of Scheme
          20, loss of the second axial halogen ligand would produce a
          dirhodium core of square planar Rh.sup.I centers, which then
          disproportionate to a Rh.sup.0 --Rh.sup.II species to restore
          the metal-metal bond. The observation of a blue intermediate
          upon irradiation of Rh.sub.2.sup.II,II (dfpma).sub.3 Br.sub.4
          in THF solutions absent a donor ligand supports the
          intermediacy of Rh.sup.I centers. In either mechanism,
          thermodynamic remuneration afforded by re-establishing the
          Rh--Rh bond drives elimination of the second halogen and
          stabilizes the binuclear core to oxidative back-reaction.
          Similarly, the photochemical reductive elimination chemistry
          of Rh.sub.2.sup.0,II (dfpma).sub.3 X.sub.2 (L) appears to
          proceed by an initial one-electron halogen elimination.
          Formation of the metal-metal bond upon reduction to
          Rh.sub.2.sup.0,0 facilitates expulsion of the second halogen
          from the bimetallic core. ##STR21## </p>
        <p>Sustaining the metal-metal bond of the Rh.sub.2 dfpma system
          also circumvents problems previously associated with the
          utilization of two-electron mixed-valency in the design of
          multi-electron schemes. Previous to the studies described
          here, the presence of a two-electron mixed-valence
          intermediate has been observed to render complexes inert to
          further oxidation-reduction chemistry. This redox deactivation
          has been attributed to the inability of the ligand to
          electronically and conformationally support the appropriate
          energetics that make the bimetallic core amenable to further
          reaction. Along this line, the flexibility of the dfpma ligand
          allows for the respective octahedral and trigonal bipyramidal
          geometries of di- and zero-valent rhodium to be accommodated
          with facility. Stabilization of these disparate coordination
          geometries within a single bimetallic core of the
          Rh.sub.2.sup.0,II complex maintains the reactivity of the
          species by avoiding metal-metal bond cleavage that typically
          deactivates binuclear complexes to multi-electron reactivity.
        </p>
        <p>Coupled two-electron photoreactions assume a prominent
          position in energy conversion chemistry, especially when a
          metal-halide bond is involved. Consider the splitting of
          hydrohalic acids to H.sub.2 and X.sub.2. Whereas the
          elimination of H.sub.2 from metal centers is feasible, the
          benchmark studies on the energy conversion chemistry of
          d.sup.8 . . . d.sup.8 dimers show that the elimination of
          X.sub.2 poses a more significant challenge owing to the high
          stabilities of the metal-halide bond. For instance, the HX
          photochemistry of Rh.sup.I.sub.2 diisocyanide complexes is
          stoichiometric because the cycle to regenerate the initial
          photoreagent terminates with the formation of the Rh.sup.II
          --X bond. The incorporation of a d.sigma.* excited state
          across the Rh.sub.2.sup.II,II (dfpma).sub.3 X.sub.4,
          Rh.sub.2.sup.0,II (dfpma).sub.3 X.sub.2 (L), Rh.sub.2.sup.0,0
          (dfpma).sub.3 (L).sub.2 series surmounts the energetic barrier
          to halogen atom elimination, and therefore provides a means
          for interconversion between the series members in two electron
          steps. </p>
        <p>Sequential two-electron reductive-elimination photoreactions
          provide for efficient interconversion among the members of the
          Rh.sub.2 -dfpma series. Photon absorption promotes activation
          of an axial halogen leading to reduction of the metal center
          and cleavage of the Rh--X bond. Preservation of the
          metal-metal bond across the series maintains the reactivity of
          the binuclear core, providing a reasonable platform for the
          investigation of multi-electron reactions. </p>
        <p><b>HX Photochemistry of Rhodium Diphosphazanes</b> </p>
        <p>The photochemical activation of M-X bonds in two electron
          mixed-valence complexes prompted the development of a scheme
          to produce hydrogen photocatalytically from hydrohalic acid.
          Initial studies probed whether a Rh0 diphosphazane center
          could efficiently reduce protons to dihydrogen. Methods to
          couple the stoichiometric proton reduction to the reductive
          elimination photochemistry were then be investigated. These
          studies led to the construction of two HX splitting cycles
          using Rh.sub.2 diphosphazanes as photocatalysts. </p>
        <p>Light driven energy conversion schemes were suggested as an
          alternative energy source to expendable fossil fuel reserves
          nearly a century ago. The ##STR22## </p>
        <p>target fuel of schemes developed since this proposal has been
          hydrogen, generated from protic solutions. The most successful
          approaches to date have used a heterogeneous catalyst to
          couple the single electron equivalency provided by a
          photoexcited transition metal sensitizer (e.g. Ru(II)
          polypyridine complexes) to the two-electron equivalency
          required for hydrogen production (Scheme 21). Photoexcited
          electrons in the conduction bands of semiconducting electrodes
          and nanoparticles are especially effective in promoting the
          reduction of protons to hydrogen. Utilization of the attendant
          hole in the valence band to generate a complementary oxidation
          product completes a photocatalytic cycle. Hydrogen production
          in the absence of mediators has also been realized, but only
          under stoichiometric conditions. Research in the 1950's and
          1960's established that the ultraviolet irradiation of acidic
          solutions containing reduced metal ions such as Ce.sup.3+,
          Cr.sup.2+ and Fe.sup.2+ produced hydrogen and the one-electron
          oxidized metal cation. In these schemes, excitation of a
          charge-transfer-to-solvent (CTTS) absorption band effectively
          produces a solvated electron that is trapped by a proton to
          produce hydrogen atom radicals, which combine to produce
          hydrogen. </p>
        <p>Gray and co-workers' seminal work on the photochemistry of
          dirhodium(I) isocyanides in hydrohalic acid solutions
          established the viability of using a molecular excited state
          to promote proton reduction in homogeneous solution (Scheme
          22). Irradiation of the binuclear Rh.sup.I complex,
          [Rh.sub.2.sup.I,I (bridge).sub.4 ].sup.2+ (bridge
          =1,3-diisocyanopropane) in aqueous concentrated hydrohalic
          acid solutions resulted in the stoichiometric production of
          one equivalent of H.sub.2 and one equivalent of the
          two-electron oxidized complex [Rh.sub.2.sup.II,II
          (bridge).sub.4 Cl.sub.2 ].sup.2+. This system was of great
          importance because it demonstrated the feasibility of driving
          a multi-electron reduction from a discrete molecular excited
          state. Whereas Ru-bipyridyl systems exemplified by Scheme 21
          and single-metal CTTS systems were based on single electron
          transfer from a molecular excited state, the [Rh.sub.2.sup.I,I
          (bridge).sub.4 ].sup.2+ complex could directly provide both
          reducing equivalents for H.sub.2 production. The inability to
          subsequently activate the Rh.sup.II --X bond of
          [Rh.sub.2.sup.II,II (bridge).sub.4 Cl.sub.2 ].sup.2+ obviated

          uncontrolled reduction of the rhodium complex was observed,
          yielding intractable product mixtures. .sup.19 F NMR

          and Rh.sub.2.sup.0,0 products depending on reaction

        <p>The preparation of rhodium dihydrides was targeted directly
          by the reaction of dfpma with monomeric Rh.sup.I -hydride

        <p>Wilkinson's catalyst, react with dfpma to afford two-electron
          mixed-valence complexes according to Scheme 24. By analogy,

          expected to afford species of the general formulation
          Rh.sub.2.sup.0,II (dfpma).sub.3 H.sub.2 (L). The addition of
          dfpma to HRh(PPh.sub.3).sub.4 in benzene solution resulted in
          an immediate color change to red with concomitant gas
          evolution. The product, Rh.sub.2.sup.0,0 (dfpma).sub.3
          (PPh.sub.3).sub.2, was isolated as an orange powder from the
          reaction mixture in nearly quantitative yield. The product was

          was frozen and exactly 1.6 equiv of the dfpma ligand was

          upon thawing the benzene solution, as evidenced by a color
          change to red and by gas evolution. The solution was frozen
          and the H.sub.2 was collected by Toepler pumping. 0.72 equiv
          of non-condensable gas was identified to be H.sub.2 by burning
          over hot CuO. The Rh.sub.2.sup.0,0 (dfpma).sub.3
          (PPh.sub.3).sub.2 product was collected in 85% yield,
          confirming the 1:1 ratio of rhodium dimer:H.sub.2 gas. A
          two-electron mixed-valence rhodium dihydride is presumably the
          intermediate species from which H.sub.2 is evolved. </p>
        <p><b>Stoichiometric Proton Photoreduction</b> </p>
        <p>The facile elimination of H.sub.2 from a dihydride
          intermediate indicated that the binuclear rhodium core is
          sufficiently electron-rich to effect the reduction of protons.
          This potential reactivity pathway was explored by
          investigating the reaction of HX with the Rh.sub.2 plafform.
          However, solutions of Rh.sub.2.sup.0,0 (dfpma).sub.3 (L).sub.2
          complexes in CH.sub.2 Cl.sub.2 or THF did not oxidatively add
          hydrohalic acids in the absence of light. It is well
          established that oxidative addition to electronically
          saturated metal complexes must be preceded by dissociation of
          a coordinated ligand. Accordingly, the lack of reactivity
          observed for Rh.sub.2.sup.0,0 (dfpma).sub.3 (L).sub.2
          complexes with HX is ascribed to the coordinatively saturated,
          36e.sup.-, Rh.sub.2.sup.0,0 core. One strategy for generating
          vacant coordination sites is the photoelimination of carbonyl
          or isonitrile ligands from a metal core. Thus Rh.sub.2.sup.0,0
          (dfpma).sub.3 (L).sub.2 complexes containing L=CO and CN.sup.t
          Bu were prepared. </p>

          Treatment of [ClRh(CO).sub.2 ].sub.2 with three equivalents of
          dfpma under a CO atmosphere afforded the dicarbonyl complex
          after recrystallization from CH.sub.2 Cl.sub.2 /hexanes at
          -80.degree. C. Similarly, [ClRh(cod)].sub.2 reacted in the
          presence of two equivalents of CN.sup.t Bu to give the
          isonitrile derivative after similar workup. The complexes were
          readily identified by .sup.19 F NMR spectra, which display
          .vertline..sup.1 J.sub.PF +.sup.3 J.sub.PF.vertline. doublets
          at -40.3 and -40.5 ppm for the CO and CN.sup.t Bu derivatives,
          respectively. Though no net reaction occurs, the rhodium
          dimers can be reversibly protonated with strong acids. The
          reaction of Rh.sub.2.sup.0,0 (dfpma).sub.3 (CO).sub.2 with HCl
          in CH.sub.2 Cl.sub.2 afforded an off-white solid upon
          precipitation with pentane. Drying under reduced pressure
          resulted in a color change back to yellow, and NMR spectra of
          the yellow solid identically match the Rh.sub.2.sup.0,0
          dicarbonyl dimer. Similarly, treatment of Rh.sub.2.sup.0,0
          (dfpma).sub.3 (CN.sup.t Bu).sub.2 with one equivalent of
          trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (HOTF, triflic acid) afforded
          [HRh.sub.2 (dfpma).sub.3 (CN.sup.t Bu).sub.2 ][OTf] upon
          precipitation, as determined by elemental analysis. In
          solution, the cation deprotonates to regenerate
          Rh.sub.2.sup.0,0 (dfpma).sub.3 (CN.sup.t Bu).sub.2 and the
          triflic acid. </p>

          (CN.sup.t Bu).sub.2 and 0.1 M HBr. The dicarbonyl compound
          gave similar results, as did substitution the reaction with
          HCl substituted for HBr. Excitation of the
          d.sigma..fwdarw.d.sigma.* transition of the Rh.sub.2.sup.0,0
          complex with 300.ltoreq..lambda..ltoreq.400 nm light resulted
          in loss of the axial isonitrile ligand from the metal
          coordination sphere followed by acid reaction. The absorption
          spectrum of the final rhodium-containing product corresponds
          to Rh.sub.2.sup.II,II (dfpma).sub.3 Br.sub.4 production.
          Attendant H.sub.2 evolution was confirmed by Toepler pump
          experiments, which revealed ca. two equivalents of
          non-condensable gas that combusted over hot cupric oxide,
          establishing the overall stoichiometry of the reaction to be,

        <p>The photo-inertness of phosphine ligands allows the
          four-electron proton reduction of Equation 11 to be
          deconstructed into distinct two-electron reactions. A

          in situ reduction of Rh.sub.2,II (dfpma).sub.3 Cl.sub.2 (CO)
          with cobaltocene in the presence of triphenylphosphine. The
          complex, Rh.sub.2.sup.0,0 (dfpma).sub.3 (CO)(PPh.sub.3), is
          characterized by two .vertline..sup.1 J.sub.PF +.sup.3
          J.sub.PF.vertline. doublets in the .sup.19 F NMR spectrum at
          -41.8 and -43.6 ppm. FIG. 34(a) displays the changes in the

          (CO)(PPh.sub.3) is photolyzed with .lambda..sub.exc.gtoreq.335
          nm light in CH.sub.2 Cl.sub.2 solution containing 0.1 M HCl.
          As shown in FIG. 34(b), similar reactivity was observed with
          HBr. Examination of the terminating absorption spectrum
          revealed that Rh.sub.2.sup.0,II (dfpma).sub.3 Cl.sub.2
          (PPh.sub.3) is the photoproduct. On the basis of the measured
          molar absorption coefficients, the photoconversion of the
          Rh.sub.2.sup.0,0 complex to the mixed-valence
          Rh.sub.2.sup.0,II complex was quantitative. Furthermore,
          collection of non-condensable gas with a Toepler pump was
          consistent with the formation of one equivalent of H.sub.2
          during the photolysis. </p>
        <p>Wavelength selection of the excitation light suggests that
          the two-electron reduction of H.sub.2 proceeds by a stepwise
          reaction sequence. Irradiation of Rh.sub.2.sup.0,II
          (dfpma).sub.3 Cl.sub.2 (PPh.sub.3) in a 0.1 M HCl/THF solution
          with .lambda..sub.exc =335 nm light caused the changes in the
          UV-Vis absorption spectrum shown in FIG. 35(a). Disappearance
          of the Rh.sub.2.sup.0,0 (dfpma).sub.3 (PPh.sub.3)(CO)
          absorption features were accompanied by the growth of an
          absorption band centered at 580 nm. After 90 min of
          irradiation, no further changes were observed in the 580-nm
          absorption band; scaled up reaction conditions provided
          0.35(7) equiv of H.sub.2 per mole of Rh.sub.2 complex. The
          580-nm absorption profile did not change with continued
          irradiation nor did its intensity change when solutions were
          stored in the dark. Though the 580-nm intermediate has not
          been isolated and characterized, its spectral features are
          characteristic of linear tetranuclear rhodium clusters
          possessing mixed-valence character. As observed by Gray and
          co-workers in their studies of [Rh.sub.2.sup.I,I
          (bridge).sub.4 ].sup.2+, a tetranuclear rhodium species can
          result from the bimolecular reaction of two hydrido-halo
          dirhodium cores to produce 0.5 equiv of H.sub.2 and the
          tetranuclear species. Upon changing the excitation wavelength
          to include visible wavelength frequencies, the absorbance
          decreased with the concomitant appearance of the two-electron
          mixed-valence dihalide, Rh.sub.2.sup.0,II (dfpma).sub.3
          Cl.sub.2 (PPh.sub.3) (FIG. 35(b)). Consistent with the overall
          stoichiometry of eq 11, Toepler pumping of scaled-up
          photoreactions gave an additional 0.38(7) equiv of H.sub.2. </p>
        <p>Equation 11 suggests that a second two-electron proton
          reduction must be possible for the Rh.sub.2.sup.0,II complex.
          Irradiation of Rh.sub.2.sup.II (dfpma).sub.3 Br.sub.2
          (CN.sup.t Bu) in CH.sub.2 Cl.sub.2 solutions containing 0.1 M
          HBr gave rise to the absorption changes of FIG. 36. Similar
          results were obtained for irradiation of Rh.sub.2.sup.0,II
          (dfpma).sub.3 Cl.sub.2 (CN.sup.t Bu) with HCl. Again,
          quantitative two-electron reaction was observed, yielding
          Rh.sub.2.sup.II,II (dfpma).sub.3 Br.sub.4 and one equivalent
          of hydrogen gas. Thus, each metal center appears to react
          independently in two-electron steps according to the sequence,

        <p><b>Low-Valent H.sub.2 Photocatalysis</b> </p>
        <p>Because a Rh.sub.2 0,0 species can be regenerated by
          photolysis of Rh.sub.2.sup.0,II (dfpma).sub.3 X.sub.2
          (PPh.sub.3) in the presence of halogen atom traps, eq 12 can
          be turned over and H.sub.2 can be generated
          photocatalytically. A 50-mL THF solution containing
          Rh.sub.2.sup.0,II (dfpma).sub.3 Cl.sub.2 (PPh.sub.3) (0.95
          .mu.mol) and 0.1 M HCl was irradiated with
          .quadrature..sub.exc.gtoreq.335 nm after which the photolysis
          was halted and H.sub.2 was collected by Toepler pumping. This
          procedure was repeated at 3-hour intervals to generate the
          plot in FIG. 37(a), which displays total H.sub.2 production
          vs. time. A pseudo-initial rate of 27 turnovers per hour was
          observed during the first 3-hour interval followed by a
          decreased rate of H.sub.2 production with continued
          photolysis. An attendant decrease in the absorbance of the
          Rh.sub.2.sup.0,II (dfpma).sub.3 Cl.sub.2 (PPh.sub.3) catalyst
          is shown in FIG. 37(b), indicating decomposition of the
          two-electron mixed-valence dimer. </p>
        <p>Photolyses carried out with high catalyst concentrations for
          long irradiation times resulted in polymerization of the THF
          solvent. To determine if H.sub.2 formation originated from the
          HX or from the decomposition of THF solvent, an isotope
          crossover experiment was conducted. A photolysis carried out
          using ten equivalents of HCl in d.sup.8 -THF was monitored by
          .sup.1 H NMR spectroscopy. Only H.sub.2 was observed during
          the first few hours of irradiation (ca. 1-2 turnovers).
          Subsequently, HD was observed in the .sup.1 H NMR spectrum,
          resulting from deuterium atom abstraction by photo-eliminated
          halogen (Scheme 26, presumably D.sub.2 was also formed, but
          not observed by .sup.1 H NMR spectroscopy). After five
          turnovers of the dirhodium catalyst, the ratio of H.sub.2 :HD
          was determined to be 1.4(2). The production of H.sub.2,
          D.sub.2 and HD may be modeled as a binomial distribution with
          the caveat that once HCl reacts to form H.sub.2 or HD, it is
          permentantly removed from the catalytic cycle. Deuterium atom
          abstraction from THF gives DCl, thus the total acid
          concentration remains constant. Scheme 26 presents projected
          H.sub.2, D.sub.2 and HD quantities, based on the reaction
          chemistry of Scheme 26. After five turnovers, the projected
          H.sub.2 :HD ratio is 1.2, in good agreement with the ratio
          measured by NMR spectroscopy. ##STR29## </p>
        <p>Attempts to determine the quantum yield for H.sub.2
          production were complicated by the appearance of the 580-nm
          intermediate during monochromatic UV irradiation. FIG. 39(a)
          shows the UV-Vis absorption changes associated with the
          irradiation (.lambda..sub.exc =335 nm) of Rh.sub.2.sup.0,II
          (dfpma).sub.3 Cl.sub.2 (PPh.sub.3) in THF solution containing
          0.1 M HCl. Monitoring the disappearance of the band at 350 nm
          provided a crude estimate of 0.005(2) for the photochemical
          quantum yield. As seen in FIG. 39(a), the changes in the UV
          region of the absorption spectrum were complete after 10 min
          of irradiation, yet continued growth of the 580-nm band was
          observed. This continued growth resulted from a slower dark
          reaction, evident in FIG. 39(b), which shows a slow increase
          in intensity for the 580-nm band in the absence of
          irradiation. Though inconclusive, such an observation is in
          accord with the dimerization of Rh.sup.0 - - - Rh.sup.I
          species to form a tetranuclear cluster, as low local
          concentrations of the one-electron mixed-valence species
          should result in slow rates of formation. Analogous to the
          580-nm intermediate observed for the monochromatic irradiation
          of Rh.sub.2.sup.0,0 (dfpma).sub.3 (PPh.sub.3)(CO), excitation
          of this intermediate solution within the envelope of the
          580-nm absorption band led to regeneration of the
          Rh.sub.2.sup.0,II (dfpma).sub.3 Cl.sub.2 (PPh.sub.3) complex.
        </p>
        <p>The above results are consistent with the catalytic cycle
          shown in Scheme 27. Per Toepler pump experiments, two
          equivalents of HX react with two unsaturated LRh.sup.0
          --Rh.sup.0 species to produce one equivalent of H.sub.2 and
          the blue intermediate, which is tentatively ascribed to a
          tetranuclear rhodium complex. This intermediate species is
          photochemically stable in the absence of visible-light
          irradiation; however, absorption of a 580 nm photon prompts
          cleavage of the suspected tetramer followed by subsequent
          reaction to give two molecules of the LRh.sup.0 --Rh.sup.II
          X.sub.2 mixed-valence complex with the generation of an
          additional equivalent of H.sub.2. The near-UV irradiation of
          the two-electron mixed-valence photoproduct in the presence of
          halogen atom trap regenerates LRh.sup.0 --Rh.sup.0, which is
          available to react with HX to turn the cycle over. </p>

          M.sup.-1 cm.sup.-1) and 379 nm (.epsilon.=11,700 M.sup.-1

          a metal-metal bonded species. A shoulder observed near 450 nm
          attributed to a d.pi.*.fwdarw.d.sigma.* type transition and a
          weak band centered at 583 nm (.epsilon.=525 M.sup.-1
          cm.sup.-1) also grow in with photolysis. Continued irradiation
          of the new species led to hydrogen production, as determined
          by Toepler pump collection. Moderate turnover numbers varying
          between 20 and 50 were obtained for experiments employing

        <p>To help elucidate the molecular structure of the new

          suitable for NMR analysis. FIG. 41 presents the .sup.19 F NMR
          spectra obtained for the irradiation of a 0.7 mL d.sup.8 -THF
          solution of Rh.sub.2.sup.II,II (dfpma).sub.3 Cl.sub.4
          containing 0.2 M HCl. The spectrum of FIG. 41(a) is the
          .sup.19 F NMR spectrum of Rh.sub.2.sup.II,II (dfpma).sub.3
          Cl.sub.4, showing the five-resonance .vertline..sup.1 J.sub.PF

          into the NMR tube resulted in no reaction as evidenced by the
          .sup.19 F NMR spectrum presented in FIG. 41(b). The sample was
          then irradiated using a 360-nm band-pass filter (300
          nm.ltoreq..lambda..sub.exc.ltoreq.400 nm) at 20.degree. C.
          Within minutes the orange-red solution had turned intense
          purple. When the sample was removed from the irradiation
          source, the purple color rapidly faded to a dark red. After 3
          hours of irradiation, the sample was removed from the light
          source and .sup.1 H and .sup.19 F NMR spectra were recorded.
          The .sup.1 H NMR spectrum showed a new dfpma methyl resonance
          at 3.05 ppm and a small peak at 4.53 ppm, attributed to
          H.sub.2 gas. The .sup.19 F NMR, presented in FIG. 41(c),
          indicated the formation of a new dirhodium species. The
          conversion to the new complex was completed with continued
          irradiation (18 hr) as shown in the .sup.19 F NMR spectrum of
          FIG. 41(d). The .sup.1 H NMR spectrum showed evidence for
          H.sub.2 evolution over the entire 18-hour irradiation period.
          Furthermore, a 1:1:1 triplet at 4.50 ppm (.sup.1 J.sub.HD =43

          coordination mode would account for this low frequency
          PF.sub.2 resonance. One possible assignment for this new
          rearranged species is shown in Scheme 28. In the absence of a
          suitable donor ligand, a structure analogous to that observed
          for Ir.sub.2.sup.0,II cores can be obtained by photochemical
          reductive elimination from the Rh.sub.2.sup.II,II platform.

        <p>The new complex, Rh.sub.2.sup.0,II (dfpma).sub.3 Cl.sub.2,
          was independently prepared by treating [ClRh(CO).sub.2 ].sub.2
          with three equivalents of dfpma in CH.sub.2 Cl.sub.2. Gas
          evolution was accompanied by the formation of a deep red
          solution. The solvent was then removed to leave a sticky red
          solid that was treated with a 1:2 solution of benzene and
          pentane. Rh.sub.2.sup.0,II (dfpma).sub.3 Cl.sub.2 (CO) was
          isolated as an orange-red powder. Unlike the other
          Rh.sub.2.sup.0,II (dfpma).sub.3 X.sub.2 (L) derivatives
          described herein, Rh.sub.2.sup.0,II (dfpma).sub.3 Cl.sub.2
          (CO) is not stable in the solid state. Orange-red samples
          turned green if left under active vacuum overnight, with
          concomitant loss CO as indicated by the loss of the
          .nu..sub.CO stretch at 2057 cm.sup.-1. The green solid affords
          deep red solutions in THF, and as shown in FIG. 41(e), the
          .sup.19 F NMR spectrum in d.sup.8 -THF solution identically
          matches the Rh.sub.2 photoproduct. Presumably, CO loss gives
          the intermediate species depicted in Scheme 29, which
          rearranges to the final structure in solution. The most
          notable features in the .sup.19 F NMR spectrum of
          Rh.sub.2.sup.0,II (dfpma).sub.3 Cl.sub.2 product are the high
          frequency doublet for the axial PF.sub.2 of the chelating
          ligand, observed at -15.4 ppm, and the low frequency
          .vertline..sup.1 J.sub.PF +.sup.3 J.sub.PF.vertline. doublet
          for the PF.sub.2 groups located trans to the chloride ligands,
          observed at -80.8 ppm. A critical difference in the .sup.19 F
          NMR spectra of FIG. 41 is the conditions under which the data
          were collected. In the spectra of FIG. 41(b)-(d), the d.sup.8
          -THF solution was 0.2 M in HCl; in the spectrum of FIG. 41(e),
          no acid was present. Indeed, treatment of d.sup.8 -THF
          solutions of Rh.sub.2.sup.0,II (dfpma).sub.3 Cl.sub.2 with up
          to 10 equiv of anhydrous HCl gas resulted in no observable
          change in either the .sup.1 H or .sup.19 F NMR spectra
          (excepting observation of the solvated proton in the .sup.1 H
          NMR spectrum). ##STR32## </p>
        <p>In contrast to the low reactivity of Rh.sub.2.sup.0,II
          (dfpma).sub.3 Cl.sub.2 with proton sources, pure .sigma.-donor
          ligands add to the vacant axial site of the rhodium dimer as
          in Scheme 30. The .sup.1 H NMR of the PMe.sub.3 derivative
          shows a doublet for the alkyl phosphine ligand at 1.78 ppm
          (.sup.2 J.sub.PH =11 Hz) and two distinct methyl resonances at
          2.93 and 3.10 ppm for the chelating and bridging dfpma
          ligands, respectively. The .sup.19 F NMR spectrum of the
          PMe.sub.3 complex displays a low frequency pattern largely
          unchanged from the parent Rh.sub.2.sup.0,II (dfpma).sub.3
          Cl.sub.2 complex, but the high frequency axial PF.sub.2 groups
          shifts slightly downfield to -13.1 ppm. Similarly, the .sup.1
          H NMR of the [Rh.sub.2.sup.0,II (dfpma).sub.3 Cl.sub.3 ].sup.-
          anion shows resonances at 2.79 and 2.86 ppm for the dfpma
          ligands. The signature resonance for the axial PF.sub.2 group
          of the [Rh.sub.2.sup.0,II (dfpma).sub.3 Cl.sub.3 ].sup.- anion
          is shifted up to +7.4 ppm in the .sup.19 F NMR spectrum.
          ##STR33## </p>
        <p>Oxidative addition of halogens to Rh.sub.2.sup.0,II
          (dfpma).sub.3 Cl.sub.2 proceeded smoothly, yielding
          valence-symmetric Rh.sub.2.sup.II,II (dfpma).sub.3 Cl.sub.2
          X.sub.2 products (Scheme 30). This is a structural departure
          from the reactivity displayed by Ir.sub.2.sup.0,II
          (tfepma).sub.3 Cl.sub.2, which affords Ir.sub.2.sup.I,III
          (tfepma).sub.3 Cl.sub.4 upon oxidation with chlorine.
          Moreover, the addition of bromine to Rh.sub.2.sup.0,II
          (dfpma).sub.3 Cl.sub.2 proceeded at one metal center, to give
          a Br.sub.2 Rh.sup.II --Rh.sup.II Cl.sub.2 oxidation product as
          indicated by the .sup.19 F NMR spectrum of Scheme 30. The most
          notable indicator of coordination geometry is the
          low-frequency resonances at -76.1 and -77.6 ppm, assigned to
          PF.sub.2 groups of the dfpma ligands located trans to halide
          ligands. The observation of two distinct resonances in this
          region unambiguously establishes the absence of a mirror plane
          in the Rh.sub.2.sup.II,II product, which would be expected for
          a ClBrRh.sup.II --Rh.sup.II BrCl complex. </p>
        <p>Based on the observed reactivity of Rh.sub.2.sup.0,II
          (dfpma).sub.3 Cl.sub.2, the cycle shown in Scheme 31 is
          proposed for photochemical hydrogen production using the
          high-valent catalyst. Irradiation with UV-visible light
          promotes halogen elimination from the binuclear Rh.sup.II
          complex to afford Rh.sub.2.sup.0,II (dfpma).sub.3 Cl.sub.2
          after rearrangement of a bridging dfpma ligand. As observed in
          the chemistry of Ir.sub.2.sup.0,II (tfepma).sub.3 Cl.sub.2,
          coordination of a halide to form the 36e.sup.- anion
          facilitates protonation of the binuclear species before a
          hydrogen-evolving step to regenerate the Rh2.sup.II,II
          tetrahalide complex. ##STR34## </p>
        <p>Rh.sub.2 -dfpma complexes have provided a novel platform for
          the photocatalytic production of hydrogen from hydrohalic
          acids. Irradiation of Rh.sub.2.sup.0,II (dfpma)3X2(L)
          complexes in acidic THF solution resulted in hydrogen
          production via turnover of a Rh.sub.2.sup.0,II
          /Rh.sub.2.sup.0,0 valence couple. Similarly, a high-valent
          two-electron couple between Rh.sub.2.sup.II,II and
          Rh.sub.2.sup.0,II provides photocatalytic proton reduction.
          The unifying feature in these two systems is the preservation
          of a metal-metal bond across the four-electron
          Rh.sub.2.sup.0,0 /Rh.sub.2.sup.0,II /Rh.sub.2.sup.II,II
          series. The formation of a metal-metal bond can provide a
          strong driving force for reductive elimination from binuclear
          rhodium cores. In this manner, halogen elimination from the
          Rh.sub.2 -dfpma core is facilitated and the catalytic cycles
          of Schemes 27 and 31 can be successfully turned over. </p>
        <p>This result is where the Rh.sub.2 -dfpma chemistry diverges
          from the system of Gray and co-workers shown in Scheme 22.
          Here formation of a metal-metal bond provides a strong driving
          force for oxidation of a binuclear core, facilitating the
          multi-electron proton reduction. However, regeneration of the
          Rh.sup.I hydrogen-generating species requires cleavage of the
          metal-metal bond in the [Rh.sub.2.sup.II,II (bridge).sub.4
          X.sub.2 ].sup.2+ photoproduct, adding a 32.+-.4 kcal
          mol.sup.-1 energy disbursement to the energy required for M-X
          bond cleavage. By maintaining the metal-metal bond throughout
          the catalytic cycle the Rh.sub.2 -dfpma system circumvents
          this operational energy cost. </p>
        <p>Halogen reduction by a sacrificial trap drives the catalytic
          turnover of both the high-valent and the low-valent rhodium
          systems. Thus, catalytic H.sub.2 production is only realized
          in the presence of an external reductant, which in the
          Rh.sub.2 -dfpma systems reduces halogen atoms to halides. The
          thermodynamic driving force imparted by halogen trapping in
          the current scheme obviates the design of an energy storing
          cycle, as an authentic light-to-energy strategy requires
          isolation of the attendant oxidizing equivalents. As shown in
          Scheme 32, for cycles based on HX cleavage, the next step must
          be to design a system capable of delivering both H.sub.2 and
          X.sub.2 products. ##STR35## </p>
        <p>The processes described in the Examples utilize transition

          Laboratories) were dried using appropriate agents and degassed
          by at least three freeze-pump-thaw cycles or used as received
          in glass ampoules. 1H NMR spectra were referenced to TMS using
          the residual proteo impurities of the given solvent. 1H NMR
          (300 MHz), 19F and 19F{31P} NMR spectra were referenced to an
          internal CFCl.sub.3 or TMS standard. All chemical shifts are
          reported using the standard .delta. notation in
          parts-per-million; positive chemical shifts are to a higher
          frequency from the given reference. </p>
        <p>IR spectra were recorded on a Nicolet Impact 410 spectrometer
          either as KBr pellets or as CH.sub.2 Cl.sub.2 solutions
          between NaCl plates. Absorption spectra were recorded on an
          OLIS-modified CARY-17 Spectrophotometer in quartz cells
          isolated from air by Teflon valves. Steady-state and
          time-resolved emission spectra were recorded on isomorphous
          powders contained in quartz tubes, cooled in quartz finger
          dewars. </p>
        <p>Emission lifetimes were measured on a nanosecond laser
          instrument utilizing a Coherent Infinity XPO laser as the
          source. The 3rd-harmonic of a diode pumped Nd:YAG laser passed
          through a tunable Type I XPO cavity housing a BBO crystal. The
          710 nm output, was then doubled to 355 nm (.ltoreq.7 ns FWHM
          and average power of 1 mJ). Solid samples sealed in a quartz
          tube were excited orthogonal to detection. Scattered
          excitation light was omitted from the optical detection train
          by a 366-nm long pass filter. Emitted light from the sample
          passed through f/4 collimating and f/4 focusing lenses onto
          the entrance slit of an Instruments SA Triax 320
          monochromator. The signal wavelengths were dispersed by a
          grating possessing a blaze wavelength of 500 nm and a 300
          grooves/cm density. Signal was detected with a Hamamatsu R928
          PMT. The output from the PMT was fed into a LeCroy 1 GHz
          9384CM digital oscilloscope, which was triggered from the
          Q-switch sync output of the laser. Monochromator operation,
          data storage and data manipulation were managed by National
          Instruments driver software (Labview) incorporated into
          programs written at MIT. Communication between a Dell Optiplex
          GX-1 computer and the instrumentation was achieved through a
          IEEE-488 (GPIB) interface. Lifetime decays were obtained at
          820 nm and signal averaged at 20 Hz for 1000 pulses. </p>
        <p>Hydrogen gas was collected on a vacuum line equipped with
          Toepler pump and CuO burn tube. Solutions were frozen in
          liquid nitrogen and the non-condensable gases were passed
          through three U-traps maintained at liquid nitrogen
          temperatures. Solutions were typically thawed and re-frozen
          twice during gas collection to ensure complete removal of
          dissolved hydrogen. Gas collection was typically continued for
          an hour after visible signs of gas transfer ceased (i.e., no
          gas bubbled up past the check valve). The efficiency of the
          Toepler pump was determined by collecting gas from a flask
          containing a known volume and pressure of hydrogen, and
          repeatedly gave collection quantities that were 70-75% of the
          known quantity; nevertheless, all H2 quantities reported here
          are the measured values and are not adjusted for this
          systematic error. Confirmation that the non-condensable gas
          was hydrogen came from re-circulating the gas over CuO heated
          to 320.degree. C. for an hour followed by collection of
          residual non-condensable gas. In all cases, only insignificant
          gas quantities remained after combustion. </p>

          20-ml solvent reservoir isolated from each other and the
          atmosphere by Teflon valves. Spectroscopic grade solvent was
          dried and added to the cell by vacuum transfer. Hydrogen
          halide gases were freeze-pump-thawed once before transfer into
          the cell. Large-scale photolysis experiments were performed in
          100-ml custom high-vacuum quartz reaction tubes with a path
          length of .about.2.5 cm. Samples were irradiated with light
          from a 1000-W high pressure Oriel Hg--Xe lamp. The two-inch
          collimated light beam passed through a distilled water filter
          to remove infrared wavelengths and long wave pass filters to
          remove high-energy light prior to focusing and collimating to
          a diameter of 0.5". The high-energy cut-off filters were
          replaced with 10-nm bandpass mercury line interference filters
          (Oriel) for quantum yield experiments. The light flux used for
          quantum yield determination at a given wavelength was measured
          using the standard ferrioxalate actinometer just before and
          just after sample irradiation. The progress of the
          photoreaction was monitored with absorption spectra recorded
          on a Spectral Instruments CCD Array Spectrophotometer. </p>
        <p><b>HX Control Reactions</b> </p>
        <p>The thermal reactivity of Rh.sub.2.sup.II,II (dfpma)3X4,
          Rh.sub.2.sup.0,II (dfpma).sub.3 X 2(L) and Rh.sub.2
          0,0(dfpma).sub.3 (L).sub.2 with HX in THF was evaluated under
          the conditions employed for photochemical experiments. Thus, a
          cuvette of a photolysis cell was charged with either a small
          amount of the rhodium complex. THF was distilled into the
          solvent reservoir of the cell under vacuum and subjected to
          three freeze-pump-thaw cycles. Anhydrous HX was then frozen
          into the reservoir after a single freeze-pump-thaw cycle. The
          HX/THF solution was thawed and then mixed with the rhodium
          complex under photographic darkroom lights. An initial
          absorption spectrum was recorded. The cell was wrapped in foil
          and maintained at 20.degree. C. overnight. After twelve hours,
          another UV-Vis spectrum of the sample showed only negligible
          changes in the absorption profile. </p>
        <p>Similarly, thermal hydrogen evolution by the rhodium
          complexes was investigated by conducting experiments on a
          larger scale. 50-mL THF solutions of each rhodium complex (ca.
          0.1 mM) containing 0.1 M HCl were wrapped in foil and
          maintained at 20.degree. C. for 12 h. Toepler pump collection
          of all non-condensables afforded an insignificant quantity of
          non-condensable gas (.ltoreq.3.times.10-6 mol), which did not
          burn over CuO. </p>
        <p>Hydrogen evolution in the absence of a rhodium catalyst was
          not observed either. A 50-mL THF solution containing 0.1 M HCl
          was irradiated (.lambda.exc.gtoreq.338 nm) for 12 h at
          20.degree. C. Subsequent Toepler pump collection of
          non-condensable gases afforded &lt;2.times.10-6 mol gas that
          did not combust over CuO. </p>

          Stirring overnight precipitates an orange to red powder

          Integration of the 1H NMR spectra obtained on solutions before
          and after H.sub.2 addition indicates a quantitative reaction.

          treated with 5 mL of benzene and 10 mL of pentane to give 400
          mg of orange powder analyzing as Rh.sub.2.sup.0,II
          (dfpma).sub.3 Cl.sub.2 (CO) (76%). This product was
          characterized by a strong carbonyl stretch in the IR at 2057
          cm-1. A portion of this material was exposed to high vacuum
          (10-5 torr) for several days resulting in a color change to
          green. The infrared spectrum of a KBr pellet showed no
          absorption corresponding to a carbonyl ligand. For
