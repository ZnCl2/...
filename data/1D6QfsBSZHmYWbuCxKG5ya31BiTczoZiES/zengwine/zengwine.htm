        <p><b><font size="+1">How to Make Cheap Wine Taste Like a Fine
              Vintage</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>How do you turn a bottle of cheap plonk into a fine vintage? </p>
      <p>MOST people have got one lying around somewhere: a bottle of
        cheap, nasty wine left over from a dinner party just waiting to
        be offloaded on someone else - or quaffed late one night when
        the good stuff has run out. But what if you could turn that
        bargain-basement plonk into fine wine in minutes? In these
        straitened times it could be just the thing a wine lover needs.
      </p>
      <p>Traditionalists, of course, would insist that nothing can
        replace genuine quality plus long, slow ageing in an oak barrel
        and years of storage in cool, cobwebby cellars. But could there
        be a short cut? Over the years, inventors have come up with
        dozens of widgets that they claim can transform the undrinkable
        or bring the finest wines to perfection without the long wait.
        Sadly, there's little scientific evidence that most of them
        work&nbsp;</p>
      <p> Looks like you're stuck with the plonk. </p>
      <p>Or are you? Fortunately, there is one technique that stands out
        from the rest. It is backed by a decade of research, the results
        have been published in a peer-reviewed journal and the end
        product has passed the ultimate test- blind tasting by a panel
        of wine experts. No fewer than five wineries have now invested
        in the technology. </p>
      <p>The secret this time is an electric field. Pass an undrinkable,
        raw red wine between a set of high-voltage electrodes and it
        becomes pleasantly quaffable. "Using an electric field to
        accelerate ageing is a feasible way to shorten maturation times
        and improve the quality of young wine," says Hervé Alexandre,
        professor of oenology at the University of Burgundy, close to
        some of France's finest vineyards. </p>
      <p>No matter how impatient or undiscriminating you may be, fresh
        wine is undrinkable and can have horrible after-effects. Expect
        an upset stomach, a raging thirst and the world's nastiest
        hangover. The youngest a wine can be drunk is six months. Most,
        especially reds, take longer to achieve the required balance and
        complexity. The finest can take 20 years to reach their peak. </p>
      <p>During ageing, wine becomes less acid as the ethanol reacts
        with organic acids to produce a plethora of the fragrant
        compounds known as esters. Unpleasant components precipitate out
        and the wine becomes clearer and more stable. Red wines mellow
        as bitter, mouth-puckering tannin moleculescombine with each
        other and with pigment molecules to form larger polymers, at the
        same time releasing their grip on volatile molecules that
        contribute to the wine's aroma. </p>
      <p>These reactions take time and need a small but steady supply of
        oxygen. In barrel-aged wines, oxygen leaks through the wood,
        while wine matured in steel tanks is often helped along by
        introducing microscopic oxygen bubbles. </p>
      <p>There are good commercial reasons why winemakers would love get
        their hands on a speedier alternative, especially in places like
        China where the industry is young and booming. It would allow
        them to get their wines into the shops faster to meet
        ever-increasing demand, and cut the cost of storage. </p>
      <p>The food industry has experimented with electric fields as an
        alternative to heat-treating since the 1980s, and 10 years ago <br>
        <br>
        <b>Xin An Zeng</b> , a chemist at the South China University of
        Technology in Guangzhou, decided to see what he could do for
        wine. Early results were promising enough for Zeng and his
        colleagues to develop a prototype plant in which they could
        treat wine with fields of different strengths for different
        periods of time. </p>
      <p>They pumped the wine through a pipe that ran between two
        titanium electrodes, fed with a mains-frequency alternating
        supply boosted to a higher voltage. For the test wine, the team
        selected a 3-month-old cabernet sauvignon from the <br>
        &nbsp; <br>
        Suntime Winery, China's largest producer. Batches of wine spent
        1, 3 or 8 minutes in various electric fields.&nbsp; The team
        then analysed the treated wine for chemical changes that might
        alter its "mouth feel" and quality, and passed it to a panel of
        12 experienced wine tasters who assessed it in a blind tasting
        (Innovative Food Science and Emerging Technologies , vol 9, p
        463 ). <br>
      </p>
      <p>The results were striking. With the gentlest treatment, the
        harsh, astringent wine grew softer. Longer exposure saw some of
        the hallmarks of ageing emerge-&nbsp; a more mature "nose",
        better balance and greater complexity. The improvements reached
        their peak after 3minutes at 600 volts per centimetre: this left
        the wine well balanced and harmonious, with a nose of an aged
        wine and, importantly, still recognisably a cabernet sauvignon.
      </p>
      <p>Two other good things happened: the breakdown of proteins
        produced free amino acids that contribute to taste and there was
        a noticeable reduction in the levels of aldehydes, which are
        responsible for "off" flavours. You can have too much of a good
        thing, though. Upping the voltage and applying it for longer
        brought new and unwanted changes, including the generation of
        new undesirable aldehydes. Zap it too much and the result, the
        panel found, was worse than the untreated original. </p>
      <p>Although Zeng cannot yet explain how exposure to an electric
        field alters the wine's chemistry, his results show that under
        the right conditions the technique can accelerate some aspects
        of the ageing process. "Not only can it shorten a wine's normal
        storage time, it can also improve some lower-quality wine," he
        says. "It works just as well with other grape varieties such as
        merlot and shiraz." Five Chinese wineries have begun trials. </p>
      <p>A quick blast with an electric field can improve lower-quality
        wine and shorten storage time. </p>
      <p>Sadly for wine drinkers feeling the pinch, there's no immediate
        prospect that you can try this for yourself. "I have thought of
        designing a set of equipment for use at home," admits Zheng
        "...but not yet." </p>

      <p><b>Abstract -- </b>A pilot plant scale innovative technique
        applying AC high voltage electric field to accelerate wine aging
        of Young Cabernet Sauvignon is reported in this paper. The
        design principles, equipment configuration and its effect on
        wine taste and flavour are presented. Results from a sensory
        evaluation group demonstrated that there were various effects on
        the wine quality under different conditions, some positive while
        others negative. An optimum treatment, with electric field 600
        V/cm and treatment time 3 min, was identified to accelerate wine
        aging, which made the harsh and pungent raw wine become
        harmonious and dainty. HPLC and GC/MS combined with routine
        chemical analysis methods were used to identify the differences
        between the treated and untreated samples. It was found that the
        contents of higher alcohols as well as aldehydes in volatile
        compounds decreased to a large number, meanwhile, the contents
        of esters and free amino acids slightly increased while others
        remained unchanged through all treatments. The results of this
        study show that the technology of accelerating wine aging by
        high voltage electric field is a feasible method to shorten wine
        maturing process times and to improve the quality of a young
        wine, if favourable process conditions are chosen. <br>
        Industrial relevance </p>
      <p>The application of physical treatment methods other than heat,
        such as electric field, magnetic field, ultrasonic wave and
        microwave, etc., for green processing of foods, is becoming
        popular. AC electric current is of continuous wave form, thus
        being seldom used in food processing. However, numerous previous
        studies about the effect and mechanisms of accelerating wine
        aging with high voltage AC electric field have been conducted in
        the Laboratory of South China University of Technology. This
        manuscript presents the effect of high intensity AC electric
        field on young wine’s physicochemical properties and sensory
        quality. The results presented in this paper show that it is a
        promising and novel technology to shorten the young wine’s aging
        period. Recently, a few of the Chinese winery companies have
        already started to set up the plant scale equipment. </p>

        insulator (202) and particularly suited for the inactivation of
        vegetative and bacterial spore micro-organisms. Each electrode
        includes an electrode flow chamber (207, 208) for making
        electrical contact with the pumpable food product and for
        allowing the pumpable food product to flow through the treatment
        devices. The insulator (202) is situated between the electrodes
        (201, 203) and includes an insulator flow chamber (206)
        positioned between the electrode flow chambers (207, 208) and
        provides for the flow of pumpable food product from one
        electrode flow chamber to the other. A high voltage pulse
        generator (107) applies a high voltage signal of variable
        voltage, frequency and pulse duration to the electrodes.; The
        electrode and insulator flow chambers may employ a variety of
        sectional and cross-sectional geometries including tubular,
        cylindrical, rectangular, elliptical and non-uniform design. </p>

      <p><b>Description</b> </p>
      <p><b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>The present invention relates generally to food preservation
        systems and methods and, more specifically, to a pulse electric
        field treatment device for inactivating bacteria and
        microorganisms found in liquid food products. </p>
      <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>The preservation of food products is an important industrial
        and commercial activity and is primarily based on the
        inactivation, or destruction, of microorganisms in the food
        product. Existing methods of food preservation include the use
        of salts (i.e. sodium chloride), dehydration, heat
        pasteurization and freezing to inactivate microorganisms present
        in the food product. However, many of these processes affect the
        color, texture, flavor and taste of the foods preserved. For
        example, heat pasteurization can cause thermal damage to the
        food product and adversely affect its taste, flavor and nutrient
        content. As a result of this and other disadvantages,
        researchers have strived to develop non-thermal food
        sterilization techniques. </p>
      <p>One such non-thermal food sterilization technique is known as
        Pulsed Electric Field (hereinafter PEF) treatment. Generally, in
        PEF treatment, an electric field voltage is applied across two
        electrodes where food material is between the electrodes.
        Because most liquid food products are primarily composed of
        water and nutrients such as proteins, vitamins, triglycerides
        and minerals, a corresponding electric field is induced in the
        food product and weakens the bacteria's cell structure. The
        bactericidal effect caused by PEF treatment is best explained by
        what is known as the Dielectric Rupture Theory. </p>
      <p>According to the Dielectric Rupture Theory, PEF treatment
        reduces the activity of bacteria and other microorganisms by
        damaging the bacterial or microorganism cell structure. The
        applied electric field induces an electric potential across the
        membrane of a living cell. This electric potential, in turn
        causes an electrostatic charge separation in the cell membrane
        based on the polar nature of the cell membrane molecules. When
        this electric potential exceeds a critical value, pores form in
        weak areas of the cell membrane. When the critical value is
        exceeded by a large margin, the pore formation and cell membrane
        damage have a lethal effect on the bacteria or microorganism.
        However, the lethal effect of PEF treatment is dependent on many
        factors including, inter alia, the strength and length of time
        the electric field is applied, treatment temperature and the
        species of bacteria and/or microorganism to be inactivated. For
        further information on the engineering aspects of PEF treatment,
        see Zhang, Q., G. V. Barbosa-Canovas and B. G. Swanson,
        Engineering Aspects of Pulsed Electric Field Pasteurization,
        Journal of Food Engineering, Vol. 25 pp. 261-281 (1994). </p>
      <p>In particular, the lethal effect of PEF treatment on bacterial
        spores has heretofore been limited. The limited results are due
        in part to the bacterial spore's rigid structure and ability to
        resist unfavorable environmental conditions. Therefore, current
        PEF treatment methods and devices for the inactivation of
        bacterial spores have met with only limited success. </p>
      <p><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>According to the present invention, a pulse electric field
        (PEF) treatment device is provided for preserving and
        sterilizing a liquid food product. The PEF treatment device
        includes a first and second electrode for supplying an electric
        field to the liquid food product. Each electrode includes an
        electrode flow chamber for accepting the flow of the liquid food
        product and for making electrical contact with the liquid food
        product. The PEF treatment device also includes at least one
        insulator positioned between the first and second electrodes and
        for electrically insulating the first and second electrodes from
        each other. The electrical insulator includes an insulator flow
        chamber for accepting the flow of liquid food product from the
        electrode flow chamber of the first electrode and the electrode
        flow chamber of the second electrode. The electrode flow chamber
        of the first electrode includes an inlet aperture and an outlet
        aperture. Similarly, the electrode flow chamber of the second
        electrode includes an inlet aperture and an outlet aperture. The
        insulator flow chamber also includes an inlet aperture and an
        outlet aperture. The insulator flow chamber and the electrode
        flow chambers are configured to comprise a single tubular flow
        chamber for accepting the flow of the liquid food product
        through the PEF treatment device. The insulator flow chamber
        inlet aperture and the first electrode flow chamber outlet
        aperture are positioned adjacent to each other and have
        substantially similar cross-sectional geometry. Similarly, the
        insulator flow chamber outlet aperture and the second electrode
        flow chamber inlet aperture are positioned adjacent to each
        other and have substantially similar cross-sectional geometry. </p>
      <p>The present invention also provides a PEF treatment system for
        preserving and sterilizing a liquid food product. The system
        includes a high voltage pulse generator for supplying a pulsed
        electric field, a PEF liquid product treatment device for
        subjecting the liquid product to the pulsed electric field, a
        balance tank for storing the liquid food product to be treated,
        a de-oxygenator device for removing oxygen and other gases from
        the liquid food product, a pulseless pump for providing a
        continuous flow of liquid food product in the treatment system,
        at least one heat exchanger for regulating the temperature of
        the liquid food product, and an aseptic packaging device for
        packaging the liquid food product. The PEF liquid product
        treatment device is in circuit communication with the high
        voltage pulse generator and includes first and second electrodes
        for supplying an electric field to the liquid food product and
        an insulator for electrically insulating the plurality of
        electrodes from each other. Each electrode includes an electrode
        flow chamber for accepting the flow of the liquid product and
        for making electrical contact with the liquid product. The
        insulator includes an insulator flow chamber for accepting the
        flow of liquid food product and is positioned between the
        electrode flow chambers. The insulator flow chamber and the
        electrode flow chambers are configured so that a single tubular
        flow chamber for accepting the flow of liquid food product is
        formed thereby and each have inlet and outlet apertures of
        substantially similar cross-sectional geometry and adjacent to
        each other. </p>
      <p>The present invention further provides a PEF treatment device
        having first and second electrodes for supplying an electric
        field to a liquid product, at least one insulator for
        electrically insulating the first and second electrodes from
        each other and an insertion member for providing electrical
        contact to the liquid product. Each electrode includes an
        electrode flow chamber for accepting the flow of liquid product
        and each insulator includes an insulator flow chamber for
        allowing the liquid product to flow from and to the electrode
        flow chambers. The electrode flow chambers and the insulation
        flow chamber are configured and positioned so as to form a
        single flow chamber for accepting the flow of the liquid
        product. The flow chambers each have inlet and outlet apertures
        of substantially similar apertures and are adjacent to each
        other. The insertion member is positioned within the electrode
        and insulator flow chambers and includes a plurality of
        conducting members and at least one insulator member. The
        plurality of conducting members provide electrical contact to
        the liquid product and the at least one insulator member
        provides electrical insulation between the plurality of
        conducting members. The insertion member includes a cylindrical
        body that is concentrically located within the single flow
        chamber that is comprised by the electrode and insulator flow
        chambers. </p>
      <p>The present invention further provides a method of inducing a
        pulsed electric field in a liquid product for the inactivation
        of bacterial spores. The method includes the steps of pumping
        the liquid product through a treatment device so as to create a
        liquid product flow in the treatment device, generating a
        plurality of pulsed electric fields, and inducing the plurality
        of pulsed electric fields in the liquid product wherein the
        induced, pulsed electric field vector direction is parallel to
        the liquid product flow. Furthermore, the step of generating a
        plurality of pulsed electric fields includes the step of
        generating a pulsed electric field with a frequency range of 500
        Hz to 20 kHz and an electric field range of 15 kV/cm to 160
        kV/cm. The method further includes the step of regulating the
        liquid product temperature in the range of 31.degree. to
        36.degree. C. Additionally, the step of generating a pulsed
        electric field includes a step of generating a pulsed electric
        field with a pulse length of 1 to 20 microseconds. </p>
      <p>It is therefore an advantage of the present invention to
        provide a PEF treatment device that includes at least one
        tubular flow treatment chamber. </p>
      <p>It is a further advantage of this invention to provide a PEF
        system for the preservation of liquid food products that
        includes a pulseless pump for providing a constant velocity of
        liquid product to ensure uniform treatment dosage. </p>
      <p>It is further another advantage of this invention to provide a
        PEF system, device and method for the inactivation of bacterial
        spores in addition to vegetative microorganisms, thereby making
        the system, device and method suitable for the sterilization of
        food, nutriceutic, cosmetic and pharmaceutical products. </p>

      <p><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATED EMBODIMENT</b> </p>
      <p><b>PEF Treatment System Structure</b> </p>
      <p>A pulsed electric field (PEF) treatment system is illustrated
        in FIG. 1. The system includes a balance tank 101, a
        de-oxygenator 102, a pulseless pump 104, heat exchangers 105A, B
        and C, PEF treatment devices 106A, B and C, a high voltage pulse
        generator 107 and an aseptic packaging device 108. The balance
        tank 101 holds the liquid product to be treated by the PEF
        system. The liquid product may be a wide range of products,
        including edible food products having a viscosity or extrusion
        capacity such that the food product may be forced into a flow
        through a treatment chamber. Other liquid products include
        extrudible products such as doughs or meat emulsions, fluid
        products such as beverages, fluid dairy products, gravies,
        sauces and soups, and food particulate containing food slurries
        such as stews, and food particulate containing soups, and cooked
        or uncooked vegetable or grain slurries. Moreover, the liquid
        food product may include nutriceutic, cosmetics and
        pharmaceutical products. The balance tank 101 is in physical
        communication with the de-oxygenator 102. The de-oxygenator 102
        serves to remove dissolved gasses and/or product bubbles which
        might adversely affect the development of a substantially
        uniform electric field in the liquid product as it is treated in
        PEF treatment devices 106A, B and C. </p>
      <p>The pulseless pump 104 is in physical communication with the
        de-oxygenator unit 102. The pulseless pump 104 provides the PEF
        treatment system with a flow of liquid product at a constant
        velocity to ensure uniform treatment. The pulseless pump 104 is
        further in physical communication with heat exchanger 105A and
        PEF treatment device 106A. </p>
      <p>The heat exchangers 105A, B and C are in physical communication
        with PEF treatment devices 106A, B and C as shown in FIG. 1.
        While FIG. 1 illustrates the use of three heat exchangers
        interdigitized between three PEF treatment devices, different
        combinations involving more or less heat exchangers and PEF
        treatment devices are possible. For example, the PEF treatment
        system may include only one heat exchanger and one PEF treatment
        device. Generally, the number of heat exchangers and the number
        of PEF treatment devices will depend on the system design and
        treatment objectives. The heat exchangers 105A, B and C
        primarily serve as temperature regulators for the PEF treatment
        system. As shown in FIG. 1, the liquid product's temperature is
        first regulated by a heat exchanger before entering a PEF
        treatment device for sterilization or bacterial inactivation. </p>
      <p>Still referring to FIG. 1, the high voltage pulse generator 107
        is in circuit communication with each PEF treatment device. The
        high voltage pulse generator 107 provides PEF treatment devices
        with a high voltage wave form having variable voltage levels,
        frequency ranges and pulse duration times. </p>
      <p>The last PEF treatment device (106C) is in physical
        communication with the aseptic packaging device 108. The aseptic
        packaging device 108 serves to aseptically pack and seal the
        liquid product in a sterile environment. One such commercially
        available aseptic packaging device is the Benco LaborPack/2

      <p>Referring now to FIG. 2A, a cross-sectional side view of an
        embodiment of a pulsed electric field treatment device 200 is
        shown. The PEF treatment device 200 includes a first electrode
        201 and a second electrode 203 and an insulator 202. First
        electrode 201 includes an electrode flow chamber 207 for making
        electrical contact with the liquid product and for allowing the
        liquid product to flow through the PEF treatment device 200.
        Similarly, electrode 203 includes an electrode flow chamber 208
        for making electrical contact with the food product and for
        allowing the food product to flow out of the PEF treatment
        device 200. The electrode flow chambers 207 and 208 each include
        inlet and outlet apertures at 213 and 209, and at 211 and 215
        respectively. </p>
      <p>The insulator 202 is in physical communication with the first
        electrode 201 and the second electrode 203. The insulator 202
        includes an insulator flow chamber 206 for allowing the flow of
        liquid product from the first electrode 201 to the second
        electrode 203. The insulator flow chamber 206 is in physical
        communication with the first electrode flow chamber 207 and the
        second electrode flow chamber 208 and includes an inlet and
        outlet aperture at 209 and 211 respectively. As shown in FIG.
        2A, the first electrode 201, second electrode 203, insulator
        202, first electrode flow chamber 207, insulator flow chamber
        206, and second electrode flow chamber 208 are formed and
        configured such that the electrode flow chambers 207 and 208 and
        the insulator flow chamber 206 form a single tubular flow
        chamber through the PEF treatment device. The insulator flow
        chamber inlet aperture and the first electrode flow chamber
        outlet aperture are positioned adjacent to each other and have
        substantially similar cross- sectional geometry. Similarly, the
        insulator flow chamber outlet aperture and the second electrode
        flow chamber inlet aperture are positioned adjacent to each
        other and have substantially similar cross-sectional geometry.
        The phrase "substantially similar" is hereinafter used to
        express the concept that one may depart from the overall inlet
        and outlet aperture dimensions and shape and still maintain an
        overall degree so similarity in geometry and/or functionality.
        For example, inlet and outlet physical dimensions and shapes
        need not be identical, that is, the insulator flow chamber inlet
        or outlet apertures may be slightly larger or smaller than the
        electrode flow chamber outlet or inlet apertures, or vice-versa.
        Moreover, the electrode flow chamber inlet or outlet aperture
        may be elliptical while the insulator flow chamber outlet or
        inlet aperture may be circular, or vice-versa. Therefore, it
        should be apparent that an electrode flow chamber's inlet and/or
        outlet apertures and the insulator flow chamber's inlet and/or
        outlet apertures may have different dimensions and shapes and
        still maintain substantially similar cross-sectional geometries.

      <p>Referring now to FIG. 2B, a sectional view taken along a
        section line 2B--2B of FIG. 2A of PEF treatment device 200 is

      <p>Referring now to FIG. 3A, a cross-sectional side view of a

        device 300 includes a first electrode 301, a second electrode
        303 and an insulator 302. First electrode 301 includes an
        electrode flow chamber 307 for making electrical contact with
        the liquid product and for allowing the liquid product to flow
        through the PEF treatment device 300. Similarly, the electrode
        303 includes an electrode flow chamber 308 for making electrical
        contact with the food product and for allowing the food product
        to flow out of the PEF treatment device 300. The electrode flow
        chambers 307 and 308 each include inlet and outlet apertures. </p>
      <p>The insulator 302 is in physical communication with the first
        electrode 301 and the second electrode 303. The insulator 302
        includes an insulator flow chamber 306 for allowing the flow of
        liquid product from the first electrode 301 to the second
        electrode 303. The insulator flow chamber 306 is in physical
        communication with the first electrode flow chamber 307 and the
        second electrode flow chamber 308 and includes an inlet and an
        outlet aperture. As shown in FIG. 3A, the first electrode 301,
        second electrode 303, insulator 302, first electrode flow
        chamber 307, insulator flow chamber 306, and second electrode
        chamber 308 are formed and configured such that the electrode
        flow chambers 307 and 308 and the insulator flow chamber 306
        form a single tubular flow chamber through the PEF treatment
        device 300. The insulator flow chamber inlet aperture and the
        first electrode flow chamber outlet aperture are positioned
        adjacent to each other and have substantially similar
        cross-sectional geometry. Similarly, the insulator flow chamber
        outlet aperture and the second electrode flow chamber inlet
        aperture are positioned adjacent to each other and have
        substantially similar cross-sectional geometry. In all
        embodiments hereinafter, the above insulator flow chamber inlet
        and outlet aperture configuration with electrode flow chamber
        inlet and outlet apertures shall be generally applicable. </p>
      <p>Referring now to FIG. 3B, a sectional view taken along a
        section line 3B--3B of FIG. 3A of PEF treatment device 300 is
        shown. The insulator 302 further includes an outer rectangular
        surface 314 and an inner rectangular surface having rounded ends
        at boundary 310. The first electrode 301 also includes an outer
        rectangular surface with rounded ends at boundary 310 and
        further is in physical communication with the inner rectangular
        insulator surface, also located at boundary 310. The first
        electrode 301 further includes an inner rectangular surface 312
        with rounded ends 316 and 318. The inner rectangular surface 312
        forms the electrode flow chamber 307. It should be noted that
        from FIGS. 2B and 3B, the sectional geometry of a PEF treatment
        device may take on various geometries based on design factors
        such as the nature of the liquid product (viscosity,
        particulate, electrical resistivity, etc.), liquid product flow
        rate, applied electric field strength, etc. Therefore, the PEF
        treatment device cross-sectional geometries may range from
        tubular or cylindrical cross-sections with tubular or
        cylindrical flow chambers, as shown in FIG. 2B, to rectangular
        cross-sections with rectangular flow chambers, as shown in FIG.
        3B. Other possible cross-sectional geometries for the PEF
        treatment device and the flow chambers include uniform and
        non-uniform geometries and various elliptical geometries. </p>
      <p>Illustrated in FIG. 4 is a cross-sectional side view of a third
        embodiment of a pulsed electric field treatment device 400,
        having tapered electrode flow chambers 407 and 408. The PEF
        treatment device 400 includes a first electrode 401 and a second
        electrode 403, and an insulator 402. The first electrode 401
        includes an electrode flow chamber 407 for making electrical
        contact with the liquid product and for allowing the liquid
        product to flow through the PEF treatment device 400. The
        electrode flow chamber 407 includes tapered surfaces 424 and 426
        and inlet and outlet apertures. Similarly, electrode 403
        includes an electrode flow chamber 408 for making electrical

        product to flow out of the PEF treatment device 400. Moreover,
        electrode flow chamber 408 includes tapered surfaces 420 and 422
        and inlet and outlet apertures. The tapered surfaces 424 and 426
        may be elements of various cross-sectional designs of the
        electrode flow chamber 407. Similarly, tapered surfaces 420 and
        422 may be elements of various cross-sectional designs of
        electrode flow chamber 408. For example, electrode flow chambers
        407 and 408 may include conical sectional geometries which
        include the tapered surfaces 424, 426, 420 and 422. Furthermore,
        the electrode flow chambers 407 and 408 may have rectangular or
        elliptical sectional geometries with decreasing areas that
        include tapered surfaces 424, 426, 420 and 422. Consequently,
        electrode flow chambers 407 and 408 can have any geometrically
        tapered sectional or cross-sectional geometry that is suitable
        for the system design specifications. </p>

        607 and 608 and the insulator flow chamber 606 are configured
        such that a single flow chamber is formed through the PEF
        treatment device 600. </p>
      <p>Illustrated in FIG. 7 is a cross-sectional side view of a sixth
        embodiment of a pulsed electric field treatment device 700
        having removable components. The PEF treatment device 700
        includes a first and second electrode 701 and 703. The first
        electrode 701 includes an electrode flow chamber 707 for making
        electrical contact with the liquid product and for allowing the
        flow of liquid product into PEF treatment device 700. Similarly,

        second insulators 702 and 710 are in physical communication with
        each other and are connected via threading surfaces 718 and 720.
        The first insulator 702 includes inner threads, and the second
        insulator 710 includes outer threads such that the insulators

        701 to the second electrode 703. The configuration of the
        various components shown in FIG. 7 of PEF treatment device 700
        are all concentric so that PEF treatment device 700 may be
        quickly assembled or disassembled via a twisting or turning
        motion due to the threaded interconnection of first insulator
        702 and second insulator 710. This provides PEF treatment device
        700 with the major advantages of low cost and easy maintenance.
        Additionally, PEF treatment device 700 has the advantage of
        allowing easy removal and replacement of the insulator cushion
        712 and the insulator flow chamber 706. </p>
      <p>Referring now to FIG. 8A, a cross-sectional side view of a
        seventh embodiment of a pulsed electric field treatment device

        chamber 808 for making electrical contact with the food product

        and/or circuit communication with a first conducting insert
        member 810 and the second electrode 803 is, similarly, in
        physical and/or circuit communication with a second conducting
        insert member 811. The first and second conducting members 810
        and 811 are concentric with first and second electrodes 801 and
        803 and are concentrically located within electrode flow
        chambers 807 and 808. Moreover, the first and second electrodes
        801 and 803 may include an integrated construction that includes
        insert members 810 and 811 respectively. In the illustrated
        embodiment, the conducting insert members 810 and 811 have
        rod-like geometries. </p>

        second electrode flow chamber 808, conducting insert members 810
        and 811 and insulating insert member 809 are formed and
        configured such that the electrode flow chambers 807 and 808 and
        the insulator flow chamber 806 form a single tubular flow
        chamber through the PEF treatment device. </p>
      <p>Referring now to FIG. 8B, a sectional view taken along a
        section line 8B--8B of FIG. 8A of PEF treatment device 800 is
        shown. The insulator 802 further includes an outer cylindrical

        located at boundary 816. The electrode 801 further includes an
        inner cylindrical electrode surface 812 that forms the electrode
        flow chamber 807. The first conducting insert member 810
        includes an outer cylindrical member 818 and is concentrically
        positioned within electrode flow chamber 807 to provide the flow
        chambers 807, 806, and 808 with improved liquid product flow
        characteristics (i.e. uniformity of liquid velocity), where such
        improved liquid flow characteristics are desirable. </p>
      <p>In all of the illustrated embodiments, the electrodes comprise
        food-grade stainless steel. However, any other food-grade,
        electrically conducting material may be substituted in the above
        embodiments for the stainless steel. The various insulation
        components of the presently described embodiments are comprised
        of polycarbonate. However, the insulation components may be any
        electrically insulating material such as ceramics, glass or
        plastics. </p>
      <p><b>Operation of The PEF Treatment Devices</b> </p>
      <p>To recall, the PEF treatment process applies an electric field
        voltage across two electrodes where a liquid product, such as a
        food product, exists between the electrodes. Because most liquid
        food products are primarily composed of water and nutrients, a
        corresponding electric field is induced in the food product. A
        bactericidal effect, commonly called the Dielectric Rupture
        Theory, arises due to this induced electric field in the liquid
        food product. According to the Dielectric Rupture Theory, PEF
        treatment reduces the activity of bacteria and other
        micro-organisms by damaging the bacterial or micro-organism cell
        structure. The applied electric field induces an electric
        potential across the membrane of a living cell, which, in turn,
        causes an electrostatic charge separation in the cell membrane
        and results in pore formation in weak areas of the cell
        membrane. The pore formation and cell membrane damage have a
        lethal effect on the bacteria or micro-organism. The operation
        of PEF treatment device 200 shown in FIGS. 2A and 2B will now be
        presently described in detail with respect to the inactivation
        of the Bacillus subtilis species of bacterial spore and with the
        understanding that the operational description is equally
        applicable to PEF treatment devices 300-800 shown in FIGS.
        3A-8B. </p>
      <p>Referring now to FIGS. 1, 2A and 2B, electrode 203 is in
        circuit communication with a high voltage terminal of the high
        voltage pulse generator 107 and electrode 201 is in circuit
        communication with a ground network. Therefore, when a high
        voltage pulse signal is applied across electrodes 203 and 201,
        an electric field is formed in electrode flow chambers 207 and
        208, and insulator flow chamber 206. Furthermore, due to the
        physical configuration of electrodes 201 and 203 and insulator
        202, the electric field strength will be strongest in insulator
        flow chamber 206, and will have a vector direction pointing from
        electrode 203 to electrode 201. Therefore, as liquid product
        passes through electrode flow chamber 207 to insulator flow
        chamber 206 and through electrode flow chamber 208, it is
        subjected to an applied electric field that is concentrated in
        insulator flow chamber 206. Accordingly, the liquid product in
        insulator flow chamber 206 is subjected to the concentrated
        applied electric field and because the liquid product is
        primarily composed of water and nutrients, the concentrated
        applied electric field will be present within the liquid
        product. Therefore, the bactericidal effect of the PEF treatment
        process of the present invention primarily occurs in the liquid
        product flowing through insulator flow chamber 206. </p>
      <p>Illustrated in FIG. 9 is a graph showing the effect of pulse
        duration time on the inactivation of bacterial spores at a
        constant applied electric field. More particularly, FIG. 9
        illustrates the inactivation of bacterial spores with pulse
        duration times of 1, 2, 4 and 6 microseconds and at frequencies
        of 3,000, 1,500, 750 and 500 Hz, respectively, and at an applied
        electric field strength of E=30 kV/cm and a temperature of
        T=36.degree. C. FIG. 9 indicates that, with the same energy
        input, when the pulse duration time is increased from 1 to 6
        microseconds, the inactivation of spores increases. As shown in
        FIG. 8, ninety-two percent (92%) of the spores were inactivated
        with 6 microsecond pulse durations applied for 1,770
        microseconds (i.e., 295 pulses). In FIG. 8, the frequency was
        decreased in correspondence to the increased pulse duration
        times so that a constant power input was maintained for
        comparison purposes. As evident from FIG. 8, the frequency of
        the applied electric field signal is a factor that affects the
        inactivation rate of the bacterial spores. </p>
      <p>Illustrated in FIG. 10 is a graph showing the effect of
        bacterial spore inactivation as the pulsed electric field
        frequency is varied. More particularly, FIG. 10 illustrates the
        inactivation of bacterial spores at frequencies of 2,000, 3,000
        and 4,000 Hz, with a pulse duration time of 3 microseconds and
        an applied electric field strength of E=30 kV/cm at a
        temperature of T=36.degree. C. Therefore, as the frequency
        increases, the number of pulses and total treatment time that
        the bacterial spores receive also increases. However, as shown
        in FIG. 10, the inactivation rate of bacterial spores decreases
        as the frequency increases. Since bacterial spores are hard, but
        structurally fragile, FIG. 10 indicates that there is an optimal
        PEF treatment frequency that may cause resonance of the
        bacterial spore structure. This resonance causes a loosening of
        the rigid bacterial spore structure such that the applied pulsed
        electric field can, in effect, punch through the spore structure
        and inactivate the spores. </p>
      <p>Illustrated in FIG. 11 is a graph showing the effect of
        temperature variation on bacterial spore inactivation.
        Particularly, FIG. 11 illustrates the inactivation of bacterial
        spores at different treatment temperatures with an applied
        electric field strength of E=30 kV/cm at a frequency of f=1,500
        Hz and a pulse duration time of .tau.=2 microseconds. The
        inactivation of bacterial spores was tested at 20.degree.,
        30.degree., 36.degree., 40 and 50.degree. C. The results shown
        in FIG. 11 illustrate that there is an optimum temperature of
        36.degree. C. for inactivating bacterial spores by PEF
        treatment. FIG. 11 also illustrates that the inactivation rate
        of bacterial spores increases with the total PEF treatment time
        at 30.degree. and 36.degree. C. treatment temperatures, while
        the inactivation rate does not exhibit significant change after
        540 microseconds of total treatment time at 20.degree.,
        40.degree. and 50.degree. C. treatment temperatures. These
        results indicate that at the optimum treatment temperature, more
        bacterial spores tend to germinate and to be inactivated as the
        treatment time is extended. </p>
      <p>Referring now to FIG. 12, a graph illustrating the effect on
        bacterial spore inactivation in two treatment mediums as the
        treatment time is varied is shown. FIG. 12 shows the
        inactivation of bacterial spores in two treatment mediums: a
        0.02% NaCl and a 0.02% NaCl+0.01% L-alanine. The PEF treatment
        parameters for FIG. 12 were an applied electric field strength
        of E=30 kV/cm, f=1,000 Hz, pulse duration time of .tau.=6
        microseconds and a treatment temperature of T=36.degree. C.,
        while two PEF treatment devices were used in series with an
        insulator flow chamber of 2 mm. L-alanine is considered as a
        germination agent for many strains of bacterial spores. As shown
        in FIG. 12, the inactivation rate of bacterial spores in the
        0.02% NaCl treatment medium supplemented with the 0.01%
        L-alanine germination agent is higher than that of the 0.02%
        NaCl treatment medium without any germination agent. Also as
        shown in FIG. 12, for the first 120 microseconds of treatment
        time, there is very little difference between the inactivation
        rate of bacterial spores in the two treatment mediums. However,
        when the treatment time reaches 300 microseconds, the
        inactivation difference between the two mediums grows larger.
        These results indicate that more bacterial spores tend to
        germinate and be inactivated by PEF treatment as the treatment
        time is increased. Moreover, the results of FIG. 12 are
        consistent with the temperature results shown in FIG. 11. </p>
      <p>Illustrated in FIG. 13 is a bar graph showing the effect on the
        inactivation of bacterial spores at different applied electric
        field intensities as the treatment time is varied. More
        particularly, FIG. 13 shows the effect on bacterial spore
        inactivation at three electric field levels: 30, 37 and 40
        kV/cm, while maintaining the applied electric field frequency at
        2,000 Hz and the pulse duration time at .tau.=3 microseconds and
        at a treatment temperature of T=36.degree. C. FIG. 13 indicates
        that as the electric field intensity increases, the inactivation
        of bacterial spores increases. More particularly, after the
        bacterial spores were exposed to an electric field strength of
        40 kV/cm for 3.5 milliseconds, 98% of the bacterial spores were
        inactivated. Therefore, the results shown in FIG. 13 indicate
        that in order to obtain a greater inactivation of bacterial
        spores, higher electric field strengths may be applied. </p>
      <p>Accordingly, more than 95% of Bacillus subtilis bacterial
        spores were inactivated by the continuous flow PEF treatment
        system of the present invention with frequency ranges from 500
        Hz to 4,000 Hz and a pulse duration time from 1 microseconds to
        6 microseconds. Moreover, the optimum PEF treatment temperature
        for Bacillus subtilis bacterial spores is 36.degree. C., and the
        presence of a germination agent, such as L-alanine,
        significantly enhances the PEF inactivation of the Bacillus
        subtilis bacterial spores. Furthermore, frequencies beyond 4000
        Hz are possible. For example, frequencies from 4000 to 20,000 Hz
        may be employed depending on the system design parameters. </p>
      <p>While the present invention has been illustrated by the
        description of embodiments thereof, and while the embodiments
        have been described in considerable detail, it is not the
        intention of application to restrict or in any way limit the
        scope of the appended claims to such detail. Additional
        advantages and modifications will readily appear to those
        skilled in the art. For example, the insulators, electrodes and
        liquid flow chambers may employ a variety of cross-sectional and
        sectional geometries, and the PEF treatment system operating
        parameters, such as applied electric field strength, treatment
        temperature and liquid product flow rates may be varied based on
        the nature of the liquid product to be treated, the
        micro-organism and/or bacterial to be inactivated. Therefore,
        the invention, in its broader aspects, is not limited to the
        specific details, the representative apparatus, and illustrative
        examples shown and described. Accordingly, departures may be
        made from such details without departing from the spirit or
        scope of the applicant's general inventive concept. </p>

      </b>PURPOSE:To provide a production method of wine, refined sake
      (japapese rice wine), etc., capable of promoting fermentation and
      production a fragrant product by irradiating weak ultrasonic wave
      on the fermentation material at a low temperature in a

      in a jar-fermenter 1 and the material is fermented while the
      temperature of the material is controlled at &lt;=15 deg.C by
      means of a temperature controlling device 6. Vibration energy is
      supplied to a piezoelectric transducer 3 from a vibration circuit
      2 and weak ultrasonic wave is irradiated from the piezoelectric
      transducer 3 into the inside of the jar-fermenter 1 to accelerate
      the fermentation. In this process, owing to the irradiation of the
      weak ultrasonic wave to the fermentation material at a low
      temperature, the carbon dioxide is reduced to the saturated
      concentration of the temperature and the fermentation is
      stimulated. Fragrance components affecting favorable effect on the

      The invention discloses an ultrasonic treatment device for
      reducing ethyl carbamate (EC) in brewed wine. The ultrasonic
      treatment device comprises a rotational ultrasonic generator (11),
      wherein the lower part of the rotational ultrasonic generator has
      a structure which is in the shape of a Chinese character 'feng'; a
      motor (6) and a speed reducing box (7) are arranged above the
      rotational ultrasonic generator; the line incoming side of the
      motor is connected with a time controller (8); the whole device is
      vertically arranged in the center of a tank body (1); the tank
      body has a jacket-type two-layered wall structure; an interlayer
      between the two layers of walls is a water filling layer (10); a
      water outlet (12) with a valve is formed in the lower part of the
      outer wall; a water inlet (2) with a valve, a heating pipe jack
      (3) and a tank cover (5) are arranged on the upper part of the
      outer wall; a feeding port (9) with a valve is formed in the upper
      part of the tank cover; and a discharging port (13) with a valve
      is arranged on the lower part of the tank body. The reduction of
      EC is carried out in three steps: 1, preparation of pretreatment;
      2, introduction of wine to be treated and adding of relevant
      materials; and 3, treatment of reducing the EC. By using the
      device and the method, 30-50 percent of EC in the wine can be
      reduced, and the health of drinkers is facilitated; and the device
      is low in energy consumption, low in cost and small in pollution.<br>
