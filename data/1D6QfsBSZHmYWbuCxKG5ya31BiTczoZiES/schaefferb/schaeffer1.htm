      <p><b>Note by Stefan Hartmann ---</b> </p>
      <p><b>Bernhard Schaeffer has a new steam engine that runs on water
          and Benzene, can achieve 60 % efficiency (much more than the
          Carnot Cycle efficiency )!</b> </p>
      <p>The Workshop of Decentral Energy Research e.V., West Berlin,
        Germany, proudly presents a new circular process, which defies
        the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics and converts heat energy on a 100%
        level into mechanical work! </p>
      <p>That means, that we have found a way to cool down a reservoir
        of heat a few degrees and to get mechanical work (or electrical
        energy converted with an electrical generator from the
        mechanical output) out of it ! </p>
      <p>That means, it is possible to build a self-running refrigerator
        or, e.g., to build a new boat propelling machine which gets its
        energy by cooling down the seawater by a few degrees!!! </p>
      <p>This invention was made by Bernhard Schaeffer, a Thermodynamics
        expert, who did'nt want to believe for 25 years that the 2nd Law
        of Thermodynamics is true for all cases in nature. </p>
      <p>So he began his own research program which led him to the
        Austrian inventor and physician Dr. Ing. <b>Rudolf Docezekal</b>,
        who already had shown in 1940 that such a circular process
        exists, but his ideas were almost forgotten, if Bernhard
        Schaeffer had not found them again !!! </p>
      <p>The NEW Circular Process which converts heat into 100%
        mechanical energy uses : </p>
      <p>A mixture of Benzene-water steam is heated at 147 degrees
        Celsius. If one measures now a pressure versus volume diagram
        one will get new results showing that the 2 medium steam
        mixtures behave totally different than the normally examined
        single medium steam. </p>
      <p>So with this circular process using Benzene - and Water-Steam
        one can get a bigger clockwise rotating area than the
        counterclockwise area of the pressure versus volume diagramm. </p>
      <p>That means, Bernhard Schaeffer has invented a heat-power
        machine with a "no cold pole". </p>
      <p>In this machine type the heat doesn't flow from the hot pole to
        the cold pole like in conventional heat-power motors (like in
        Stirling machines) but is simply converted to mechanical power
        output !!! </p>
      <p>Because there is no cold pole with this new type of machine you
        can't also use the Carnot equation to calculate the efficiency
        of the circular process. With this Benzol-Water circular process
        it's every time 100% !!! </p>
      <p>(This might sound a little too technical for some people: If
        You are not a physics freak and haven't yet heard about the Laws
        of Thermo-dynamics then please copy this demo to a friend who
        studies physics and tell many people about it! It's time to end
        the pollution on our planet!) </p>
      <p>The Benzene-Water process is currently only working at 147
        degrees Celsius. But there are also other steam mixtures
        available which might work in another temperature range, like 0
        to 20 degrees Celsius, which would make it possible to cool down
        the air on a hot summer day and to build a self-running
        air-conditioning system which still produces electrical
        output-power as a byproduct! </p>
      <p>What a great future for clean unpolluting energy production ! </p>
      <p>A working model of the Benzene-Water-steam energy-machine will
        be built soon, and presented to the public, when the computer
        aided maximization of the circular process has been completed. </p>

      <p>The physician, Mr. Bernhard Schaefer and his team of
        researchers, together with the Russian inventor Serogodski have
        successfully patented their new machine design, which works as a
        heat to mechanical energy converter. It does not need a "cold
        pole", it just converts the surounding heat into useful
        mechanical work. It works via "retrograde condensation" and uses
        a gas-mixture of 2 working mediums, N2 and C4H10. The German
        patent office issued the patent number: 42 44 016 Try to get it
        and read it. It is very interesting. Bernhard Schaeffer has
        worked over a 30 year time period on these limits of the 2nd
        thermodynamic sentence and finaly has won the battle. With his
        latest measurements he now can prove, that with the retrograde
        condensation with these gas-mixtures he can get efficiencies,
        which are far higher, than Carnot would predict. These
        measurements are done very precisely and it was invested a huge
        amount of money and time to build all the technical equipment to
        measure the effect at the right pressure and temperature.. </p>

      <p><b>Abstract ~ </b>An enclosed chamber whose volume can be
        increased and decreased by means of a partition or piston moving
        from BDC to TDC and back, contains a quantity of volatile liquid
        at a base temp. (a). As the chamber expands, pressure is
        adiabatically decreased (b) and the resultant superheated liquid
        evaporates spontaneously as expansion continues. The pressure
        pushes the partition outwards (c), the vapour cools and
        spontaneous condensation of the supersaturated vapour is then
        brough about, causing a sudden drop in pressure (d). The
        partition moves back to TDC (e) and the cooled condensate is
        reheated to base temp. by a heat exchanger. USE/ADVANTAGE - Heat
        engine of improved efficiency. </p>

      <p><b>Abstract ~ </b>Process for converting thermal energy into
        mechanical energy in a thermal engine comprises passing a
        working medium through an expansion phase to adiabatically
        expand the medium; and then passing it through a compression
        phase to thermally compress the medium. A rise in adiabatic
        pressure is experienced. The working medium is liquefied during
        the expansion and/or during the compression. An Independent
        claim is also included for a thermal engine for carrying out the
        process comprising a closed chamber with the expansion and
        compression phases, and a heat exchange device by which heat is
        added to and removed from the working medium. Preferred
        Features: The working medium is a multiple component mixture
        containing 10-30 wt.% water and 70-90 wt.% gasoline, or 5-10
        wt.% water and 90-95 wt.% butane. A complete liquefaction of the
        working medium in the compression phase is carried out before
        the pressure is raised adiabatically. </p>

      <p><b>Abstract ~ </b>The invention relates to a device for
        producing mechanical energy in a Carnot cycle comprising a
        working medium which consists of two components whose boiling
        points are substentially different, is embodied in the state of
        a high temperature steam at a predetermined component steam
        pressure ratio and is expanded by cooling in such a way that a
        mechanical power is produced. A component which is partly
        condensed during cooling is separated and separately
        reintroduced into the Carnot cycle. The expansion is carried out
        in such a way that it stimulates the formation of a high-boiling
        component mist whose condensation heat is mainly transmitted to
        a low-boiling still gaseous component. The gaseous working
        medium is formed above a hot liquid phase in a steam chamber.
        The two components of the working medium are not mixable in the
        liquid phase and transferred by pumping associated with heating
        a high-contact surface area in such a way that the predetermined
        steam pressure ratio is obtained. The evaporation heat of the
        high-boiling component is greater than the evaporation heat of a
        low-boiling component. </p>
