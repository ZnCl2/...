        <p><b>Abstract --</b>&nbsp; By utilizing, in a hybrid
          (electrical-heat engine) vehicle an alternator which is
          totally free of elemental iron in its magnetic circuit, the
          alternator (with appropriate rectification means) can be
          connected, selectively, in series, parallel or in lieu of the
          storage battery pack for activating the electrical motor which
          drives the wheels of the vehicle or any other load
          mechanically coupled to the electrical motor. Quick surges of
          power can thus be delivered to the load to achieve, for
          example, rapid acceleration of a vehicle. </p>
        <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
        <p><b>1. Field of the Invention</b> </p>
        <p>This invention relates to sources of driving power for
          mechanical loads and, more specifically, to hybrid-drive
          vehicles. </p>
        <p><b>2. Prior Art</b> </p>
        <p>With the advent of the shortage of oil and the rapidly
          escalating price of it, associated with the economic and
          international dangers with which this deplorable situation has
          confronted the world, new types of transportation systems have
          been proposed. Amongst these is advocated the widespread use
          of electric cars, since these can utilize any type of fuel,
          wind, solar, synthetic fuels, coal, water power, hydrogen and
          nuclear power, for example. Anything that can be used to
          generate electricity can provide power for electric vehicles.
          Unfortunately batteries now and in the forseeable future are
          too heavy to provide much range or performance for electric
          vehicles. To rectify this situation, the United States
          Department of Energy has proposed that hybrid vehicles
          (battery-powered drive train plus a heat-engine-powered drive
          train), be the interim solution. There are two types of such
          vehicles, the first being a series hybrid, of which the
          diesel-electric locomotive is an example. In the series
          hybrid, a heat engine, usually of the internal combustion
          type, drives the electric generator powering the electric
          motors coupled to the wheels. The generator is, in actuality,
          an electric transmission. The other type is the parallel
          hybrid in which there is a battery-pack-powered electric drive
          coupled to the wheels, and in addition there is a heat engine,
          usually of the internal combustion type, also coupled to the
          wheels. Usually both drives in a parallel hybrid are coupled
          to the same set of wheels, but it is possible to have one
          drive coupled to one set of wheels and the other coupled to
          another set. When the electric drive is operating in a
          parallel hybrid, it is desirable to disconnect the heat engine
          when it is not being used, to avoid high friction losses. On
          the other hand when the heat engine alone is operating the
          vehicle, it is not necessary to disconnect the electric drive
          motor's rotor, since the friction loss is small, and it has
          the advantage of acting as a flywheel. </p>
        <p>Such exhalted scientific organizations as Jet Propulsion
          Laboratory and its parent, the National Aeronautics and Space
          Administration, have dismissed the idea of a series hybrid as
          being too inefficient. To quote Briggs &amp; Stratton
          engineers, who have developed an effective hybrid using their
          small 18 horsepower engine, "the first--and simplest--method
          (to build a hybrid) is to add an engine-driven generator to
          the electric motor to recharge its batteries. This design adds
          nothing to the electric motor's performance, only its range,
          and suffers significant mechanical-electrical-mechanical
          conversion losses. In short, the series approach is deemed by
          engineers to be an inefficient one." </p>
        <p>The same argument has been used by JPL engineers to describe
          the use of an electric generator to drive the electric motor
          as is done with the diesel-electric locomotive. Another
          detracting argument is that such a generator would be much too
          heavy for an automobile. Earnest H. Wakefield, in his book,
          The Consumer's Electric Car, states that a series wound
          electric motor is capable of being used as a transmission
          without gearing because of its ability to increase its torque
          by the square of the current increase. Thus, an electric
          transmission (or series hybrid) can be more efficient than a
          standard transmission at lower speed range by reducing the
          large low speed losses. To a lesser extent this argument holds
          true with a shunt wound motor or even a conventional permanent
          magnet motor. Even JPL and Briggs &amp; Stratton agree that
          the electric motor can be an effective and efficient method to
          start an automobile, especially if it is a series wound D.C.
          motor. Briggs &amp; Stratton is quoted as saying its "hybrid
          gasoline-electric powered car takes advantage of the
          complementary characteristics of its two powerplants--the low
          speed power of the electric motor and the high speed
          performance of the gasoline engine." So we have a
          complementary situation. A series hybrid would be very useful
          and efficient in low speed city driving, while a parallel
          hybrid engine with a 1:1 gear ratio to the differential can
          perform efficiently at the higher speeds. </p>
        <p>In overcoming the initial inertia of rest of a vehicle or
          other load it would be desirable to add the rectified current
          from an engine driven alternator to that from the battery
          pack, applying the sum to the electrical drive motor. With
          conventional alternator structure there is much elemental iron
          in the magnetic circuit of the alternator and passing the
          current from the battery pack to the motor thru the alternator
          would be unthinkable since the iron would saturate, causing a
          loss of output current from the alternator. The alternator
          would become merely a load. </p>
        <p>Therefore, it is an object of this invention to overcome the
          general disadvantages set forth hereinbefore. </p>
        <p>It is a further object of this invention to provide an
          improved hybrid electrical-heat engine drive for a mechanical
          load. </p>
        <p>It is an additional object of this invention to provide an
          electrical drive system which provides, selectively, high
          torque for a desired period of time. </p>
        <p><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
        <p>By utilizing as an alternator one of the type invented by me
          and described in my copending application Ser. No. 23,607
          filed Mar. 26, 1979 and entitled "Totally Ironless
          Dynamoelectric Machine," it is possible to put the rectified
          output of such alternator in series with the battery pack
          powering the electric drive motor so as to give a surge of
          mechanical power without the magnetic saturation and loss of
          output which would be experienced if a conventional alternator
          were it to be utilized similarly. </p>
        <p>Thus, with the invention described here, the ironless
          alternator may, selectively, be placed in series with, in
          parallel with, or in lieu of the battery pack providing
          electrical power to the electrical motor driving the
          mechanical load, e.g. the wheels of a hybrid vehicle. The
          ironless windings in disc-armature alternators utilized in
          this invention are light in weight. These alternators maintain
          high efficiencies at all speeds. If the electrical drive motor
          for the vehicle is a series-wound D.C. motor its torque
          increases as the square of the amperage flowing to it. </p>
        <p>Thus, greatly improved acceleration can be realized with the
          combination acording to this invention. </p>

        <p>The features of the present invention which are believed to
          be novel are set forth with particularity in the appended

        <p><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b> </p>
        <p>In FIG. 1, heat engine 10, which may be an internal
          combustion engine, a solar engine, a nuclear engine, or the
          like is coupled through clutch 12 (which may be an automatic
          one-way clutch) to differential 14, which, in turn is coupled
          to axles 16 and 18 which carry wheels 20 and 22, respectively.
          Because of the features of this invention, a gear ratio of 1:1
          may be maintained from engine 10 to differential 14, which
          assures maximum efficiency for the power train. </p>
        <p>An auxiliary battery 24 may be provided in connection with
          the ignition system of engine 10. </p>
        <p>A drive pulley 26 is provided on engine shaft 28 for power
          take-off to pulley 30 on shaft 32 of alternator 34. Belt 36
          intercouples pulleys 26 and 30 for power transfer between
          engine 10 and alternator 34. Alternator 34 is of the type
          described in my copending application Ser. No. 23,607 filed
          Mar. 26, 1979 and entitled "Totally Ironless Dynamoelectric
          Machine." Such a machine has no elemental iron in its magnetic
          circuit. The alternator may be of the disc armature or drum
          type described in that application. The field is provided by
          permanent magnets, preferably of the ceramic ferrite type. One
          example is shown in FIGS. 3A and 3B. </p>
        <p>In FIGS. 3A and 3B a die-cast aluminum disc 100 contains
          pockets 102 for receiving ceramic magnets 104. In this
          configuration both bi-polar and one homo-polar surface are
          covered by aluminum. There are no radial conductors separating
          magnets, one from the other. </p>
        <p>Because of the non-magnetic nature of aluminum both coils 106
          and 108 intercept lines of flux from magnets 104 and produce
          AC output voltage at terminals 110, 112 and 114, 116,
          respectively. This is only one possible configuration for
          alternator 34. My prior application may be seen for other
          configurations. </p>
        <p>The output of alternator 34 goes through semiconductor
          rectifier 40 where it is changed to D-C and is applied to
          terminals 41, 43 of switcher 42. Switcher 42 may be a set of
          electromechanical relays with appropriate contacts or the
          proper combination of triacs or other thyristors. Both solid
          state and electromechanical relays and these circuits are well
          known and need not be described here. </p>
        <p>The control signal for switcher 42 is applied to terminals
          44, 46. Of course, manual switching may be utilized. </p>
        <p>The switching modes which can be achieved by switcher 42 are
          shown in FIGS. 2A, 2B and 2C. </p>
        <p>In FIG. 2A, rectified output from alternator 34 is connected
          in parallel with the output of battery pack 50 and is applied,
          through speed control 52 to electrical drive motor 54. Speed
          control 52 is a variable electrical resistor which may be
          mechanically coupled to foot pedal or accelerator 56. The
          output shaft 58 of motor 54 is coupled through differential 60
          to axles 62 and 64 which drive wheels 66, 68, respectively. </p>
        <p>In the switching mode shown in FIG. 2A, alternator 34 may be
          considered merely a charging means for battery 50. </p>
        <p>If sudden acceleration is needed the switching mode of FIG.
          2B may be desirable. In that mode, battery 50 and alternator
          34 are in series with each other, electrically, and are
          connected across motor 54. If motor 54 is a series-wound motor
          its output torque will go up as the square of the current
          flowing through it. Thus, by putting battery 54 and alternator
          34 (through rectifier 40) in series, the current thru motor 54
          will be significantly increased and its torque increased as
          the square of the increased current. Impressive acceleration
          of the vehicle or other load will result. The changes to
          series feed from parallel feed can be accomplished in response
          to a depression of foot pedal 56 so as to close contacts 70,
          72. </p>
        <p>This is a similar phenomenon to the depression of the
          accelerator in a conventional car when it is desired to put
          the car in "passing gear." A relay circuit which will
          accomplish this end is shown in FIG. 4. </p>
        <p>In FIG. 4, relay 88 includes fixed contacts 100, 102, 104 and
          106, and switch arms 108 and 110. Relay 88 also includes
          solenoid 112 which is connected in series with switch contacts
          70, 72 and auxiliary battery 24. When contacts 70, 72 are not
          closed the relay contacts are as shown in FIG. 4. Battery 50
          and rectifier 40 (which is rectifying the output of alternator
          34) are connected in parallel across output terminals 90, 92
          of switcher 42. Alternator 34 (with rectifier 40) may be
          considered as merely charging battery 50. When contacts 70, 72
          are closed, as by depressing the accelerator foot pedal,
          solenoid 112 is energized and switch arms 108 and 110 move
          into contact with contacts 104, 106, respectively. As a
          result, battery 50 and rectifier 40 are connected in series
          across output terminals 90, 92 and motor 54 receives a surge
          of current. Its torque output (if it is series wound) goes up
          as the square of such current; and the load (e.g., the
          vehicle) is accelerated. The relay may be solid state or
          electromechanical. </p>
        <p>FIG. 2C shows the switching mode for running motor 54 solely
          from alternator 34, with battery 50 eliminated from the
          circuit. Engine 10 drives alternator 34, the rectified output
          from which runs motor 54, with speed control being provided by
          means of variable resistor 52, which may be adjusted by means
          of foot pedal 56. </p>
        <p>Manual means not shown may be provided on the control panel
          of the vehicle to select the switching mode of FIG. 2, and,
          hence the source of operating current for electrical drive
          motor 54. </p>
        <p>For maximum fuel economy in highway driving the circuit to
          electrical motor 54 is broken by a switch 80, for example, and
          automatic one-way clutch 12 couples heat engine 10 to
          differential 14 with a 1:1 gear ratio. For maximum efficiency
          in city driving, automatic one-way clutch 12 de-couples heat
          engine 10 from differential 14 and switch 80 is closed,
          permitting electrical drive motor 54, alone, to propel the
          vehicle. This clutch change can be accomplished automatically
          by well-known speed sensing devices, such as centrifugal
          devices. </p>
        <p>While particular embodiments of the present invention have
          been shown and described, it will be obvious to those skilled
          in the art that changes and modifications may be made without
          departing from my invention in its broader aspects, and,
          therefore, the aim of the appended claims is to cover all such
          changes and modifications as fall within the true spirit and
          scope of my invention. </p>

        <p><b>Abstract --&nbsp; </b>Dynamo-electric stepping
          arrangement including at least one annular, inner permanent
          magnet composed of a pair of semicircular segments disposed
          within a circular hollow outer permanent magnet similarly
          composed of a pair of semicircular segments whereby the
          opposing poles of the magnets are arranged adjacent each other
          in magnetic repulsion so as to create a high-density magnetic
          field about the inner and outer magnets approximately
          180.degree. apart. A pair of coil carried on respective
          quadrants are encircled about a portion of the inner magnet so
          as to move about the magnet between the inner and the outer
          magnets. A current device is operably connected to the coils
          for selectively and periodically pulsing the coils so as to
          establish an attractive magnetic force at the respective
          leading ends of the coils whereby the coils and hence, the
          quadrants, will move in a rotary manner. By mounting the
          quadrants on a shaft, a work output may be generated. </p>
        <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
        <p><b>1. Field of the Invention</b> </p>
        <p>A dynamo electric stepping arrangement wherein by
          controllably coordinating adjacent magnetic fields sufficient
          magnetostatic force is generated to perform useful work. </p>
        <p><b>2. Description of the Prior Art</b> </p>
        <p>Man's improved technology has wrought tremendous advances in
          many fields and, in particular, the science of magnetism
          influences almost every field of human activity. The wide and
          varied uses of the properties of magnetism form an integral,
          essential component of navigational and surveying instruments
          and the very heart of most electric motors and
          instrumentation. Almost all electronic equipment utilizes
          features of magnetism either directly or in the supplying
          circuits therefor. </p>
        <p>Although magnetism is one of the oldest forces known to man,
          little has been done to harness the natural forces of
          magnetism in the form of a practical and efficient power
          source. Generally, power sources, such as motors and
          generators, for example, are presently being designed and
          fabricated by conventional methods and to standards which have
          been in use for many years. These designs and methods usually
          involve the conversion of electrical energy into mechanical
          work by employing such elements as field poles, armatures,
          condensers and brushes. </p>
        <p>In some instances, involving extremely small power outputs,
          magnetic forces have been employed in such devices as blenders
          and mixers; however, these devices are totally unsuitable for
          developing sufficient power to operate under conditions
          requiring a substantial loading of the power source such as
          may be used for a wide variety of tasks as in pumps, vehicle
          propulsion, and other mechanical and hydraulic apparatus when
          the power source is heavily loaded at all times. Furthermore,
          such conventional devices, although using natural magnetic
          forces, also include electromechanical or electromagnetic
          devices in combination therewith. </p>
        <p>Improvement in primary power sources incorporating natural
          magnetic force techniques which are permitted by modern
          technological approach and conceptual improvement can readily
          reduce the cost of such primary power sources and make the
          power sources more durable, long lived and more compact by
          effecting the controlled distortion of the magnetic lines of
          force so that a significant differential in flux density
          results whereby the known laws of magnetic attraction and
          repulsion can then be applied to effect major mechanical
          displacement. </p>
        <p>In the past, several attempts have been made to effect a
          controlled distortion of magnetic lines of force employing
          permanent magnets arranged in juxtaposition with respect to
          each other that may be physically or electromechanically
          operated to obtain a desired flux density pattern suitable to
          cause mechanical displacement to take place between the
          magnets. One such attempt is set forth in the disclosure of
          U.S. Letters Pat. No. 1,724,446 which provides fir
          intermittently introducing a shunt into the magnetic flux
          field of one of a pair of magnets arranged in juxtaposition
          relationship to create an attracting magnetic field and then
          withdrawing the shunt to create a repulsive magnetic field to
          cause one of said magnets to be alternately attracted to and
          repelled from the other magnet. </p>
        <p>However, difficulties and problems have been encountered by
          such conventional devices that stem largely from the fact that
          means are required to physically move the shunt into and out
          of the magnetic flux density pattern at precisely timed
          intervals; otherwise the efficiency and usefulness of the
          device as a power source is obviated. In some instances, such
          shunt actuation means operate electromagnetically which
          necessitates an external supply of electrical potential.
          Obviously, such means as are required by conventional magnetic
          power source devices represent relatively complex structures
          involving ancillary power and critical programming means so
          that the devices cannot be said to operate and function by
          employing pure utilization of natural magnetic forces. </p>
        <p>Accordingly, the novel magnetic power source of the present
          invention obviates the difficulties and problems encountered
          by conventional power sources by providing means for
          establishing a concentrated magnetic force field along
          movable, alternating positions in circular path so as to
          effectively react in cooperation with the magnetic field of
          permanent magnets whereby the attraction and repulsion of the
          magnetic fields for each other may be converted into
          mechanical movement. In one embodiment of the present
          invention, the magnetic power source provides an annular
          permanent magnet made from a pair of semicircular magnets
          having a north pole and a south pole established 180.degree.
          apart and another hollow permanent magnet arranged in fixed
          spaced relationship about the firs mentioned magnet having a
          similar polar arrangement. A pair of quadrant coils are
          supported on a rotatable shaft about the first mentioned,
          annular magnet so as to be movable disposed thereabout within
          the space between the annular magnet and its surrounding
          permanent magnet. </p>
        <p>I have discovered that by subjecting the quadrant coil
          members to periodic and controlled energization by application
          of current through the coils, an attractive magnet field is
          established immediately preceding or ahead of an opposite
          magnetic field and a repulsive field behind having a different
          polarity as established by the cooperative and cumulative
          effect of the permanent magnet. The natural attraction of the
          opposite magnetic fields will cause the rotatably mounted coil
          elements to travel in the direction of the attractive force.
          Obviously, by mounting the coil quadrants onto a rotatable
          shaft, the shaft will turn in response to the attractive
          magnetic force of the moving coil quadrants so that mechanical
          movement is effected. By providing a plurality of stages which
          are staggered with respect to magnetic polarities, a
          continuous rotary motion or movement can be developed so that
          continuous and smooth work output may be derived from the
          shaft. </p>
        <p>Therefore, it is among the primary objects of the present
          invention to provide a magnetic power source means employing
          the natural magnetic forces of attraction and repulsion of
          permanent magnets for each other which may be converted into
          mechanical motion by employing a movable coil element adapted
          to selectively generate a periodic magnetic flux density at
          critical locations or positions along the circular path of
          permanent magnets so as to create an attracting magnetic
          field. </p>
        <p>Another object of the present invention is to provide a novel
          magnetic power source that employs the natural forces of
          magnetism to create mechanical movement between permanent
          magnets and an electromagnet in the form of a coil surrounding
          an annular permanent magnet whereby relative movement between
          the electromagnet and the permanent magnet is effected upon
          and in response to selective energization of the
          electromagnet. </p>
        <p>Another object of the present invention is to provide a novel
          magnetic power source or motor as well as a generator as a
          correlary that may readily employ the natural magnetic forces
          available through the use of a permanent magnet and an
          electromagnet to create rotary movement between spaced apart
          magnetic means having their pole pieces arranged in opposing
          juxtaposition relationship as well as a moving relationship. </p>
        <p>Still another object of the present invention is to provide a
          novel magnetic power source, motor or generator employing
          natural magnetic forces having a sufficient amount of torque
          created thereby to perform useful work under relatively high
          load conditions. </p>
        <p>Another object of the present invention is to provide a novel
          magnetic power source or motor that is economical to
          manufacture and which employs a minimum number of parts or
          components utilizing permanent magnets, coils and other
          material readily available on the commercial market. </p>
        <p>Another object of the present invention is to provide a novel
          power source utilizing the natural force of magnetism to
          effect mechanical displacement between opposing elements for
          either rectilinear or rotary movement. </p>
        <p>It is another object of the present invention to provide a
          novel power source utilizing the natural force of magnetism to
          produce substantial power under operational loading conditions
          to effect rotary or rectilinear displacement between adjacent
          mechanical members arranged in close proximity. </p>
        <p>Still a further object of the present invention is to provide
          a novel magnetic motor whereby the attraction and repulsion of
          permanent magnets for each other may be converted into motion
          by selectively energizing a coil or pair of coil elements
          mounted on a rotatable shaft so that the pulsing of the coil
          element occurs at critical locations with respect to permanent
          magnets so as to create a magnetostatic driving force. </p>

        <p><b>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</b> </p>
        <p>Referring to FIG. 1, a magnetic power source is illustrated
          in the general direction of arrow 10 which includes a pair of
          end plates 11 and 12 having base feet 13 and 14 for supporting
          the power source on a suitable foundation. The end plates are
          spaced apart and separated by elements of the device such as
          support elements 15 and spacers 16. Tie rods, as indicated by
          numerals 17 and 18, communicate between the end plates so as
          to compress the elements 15 and spacers 16 together when
          fastened by means of nuts 20. A bearing means is enclosed
          within the housing 21 carried on both ends of the plates and
          suitable electrical commutating and control circuits are
          contained within housing 22 adjacent housing 21 on plate 13. A
          cable 23 connects the circuits and commutator within housings
          21 and 22 to a suitable source of power. toroidal partially </p>
        <p>Referring now to FIG. 2, a transverse cross-sectional view of
          the apparatus is shown in an enlarged illustration. The
          support elements 15 are disposed between adjacent opposing
          sides of spacers 16 from a ridge about a hollow toroidal
          magnet 25. In FIG. 3, for example, it can be seen that the
          magnet 25 is solely supported by the compressive force of
          nonmagnetic spacers 16 against the element 15. Also, it can be
          seen that the internal bore or hollow of magnet 25 is
          partially occupied by an annular magnet 26. </p>
        <p>FIG. 2 further discloses that the outer magnet 25 and inner
          magnet 26 are composed of semicircular segments provided with
          common or similar polarized ends facing each other. For
          example, ends 27 and 28 of one semicircular segment face ends
          30 and 31 of the other semicircular segment. Only removable
          insulative material 32 and 33 separates the ends of the
          magnets segments forming the circular magnet or magnetic ring
          26. Such material is for rigidity and to effect
          remagnetization of magnets. Similarly, it is to be noted that
          magnet 25 is composed of a pair of semicircular magnet
          segments separated by an air gap between their opposing end
          pieces which are of the same polarity. For example, end 34 and
          35 are facing one another and are of the same magnetic field
          polarity and therefore are in repulsion. Their opposite ends
          36 and 37 are of the same polarity and therefore in repulsion.
        </p>
        <p>The inner magnet 26 is supported by any suitable means, such
          as a pair of pins 40 and 41. The pins are movable carried in
          conventional solenoid switches 42 and 43 so as to move toward
          and away from the ringlike, inner magnet 26. At certain
          locations along the outer periphery of the inner ring magnet,
          there are provided recesses, such as recesses 44 and 45,
          adapted to insertably receive the ends of the pins 40 and 41,
          respectively. When the pins are so engaged, the inner ring
          magnet 26 is supported within the confines of the outer magnet
          25. Furthermore, it is also to be noted that another pair of
          solenoid operated switches 46 and 47 are provided which also
          include pins adapted to be selectively engaged with
          corresponding recesses in the ring magnet 26. The former and
          latter sets of pins are designed to operate alternatively so
          as to support the inner ring magnet by either set of pins
          according to control signals supplied to the respective pairs
          of solenoid switches. Other mechanisms may be employed for
          supporting the inner ring magnet 26. Alternating support
          members may be pivotally mounted on an axle for rocking back
          and forth so as to support the magnet at locations not
          encircled by either of the coils (to be described later). The
          rocking movement may be suitably programmed so as not to
          interfere with any moving parts or components of the
          apparatus. </p>
        <p>In FIG. 2, it can be seen further that the ring magnet 26 is
          partially encased by a pair of coil elements 50 and 51,
          respectively. Coil elements 50 and 51 may be referred to as
          electromagnets carried on the ends of webs 52 and 53
          consisting quadrants which are in turn secured to a shaft 54.
          The opposite ends of the wire forming the coil elements 50 and
          51 extend along the quadrant waves 52 and 53 and terminate in
          a commutator arrangement within housing 22. It can be seen
          that as the elements 50 and 51 move about the inner ring
          magnet 25 within the space separating magnet 26 from magnet
          25, the separate pair of support pins for mounting ring
          magnets 26 must be alternatively actuated to permit
          uninhibited passage of the coil elements. </p>
        <p>Therefore, it can be seen that by energizing the elements 50
          and 51, a polarity is established which is opposite (and
          attractive) to the polarity of the ring magnet 26 as the
          forward side of the coils approach the adjacent ends of the
          ring magnet as well as the outer magnet adjacent ends. For
          example, as illustrated, the adjacent ends of the magnet
          segments for the inner magnet 26 and the outer magnet 25,
          located along the left hand side of the drawing, are indicated
          as "S" and "N" polarity respectively, while the opposing ends
          along the right-hand side of the drawing are indicated by
          polarity "S" and "N" respectively. The indication for the coil
          segment 50 indicates a polarity "S" approaching the "N"
          polarity of the inner magnet while the forward side of coil
          segment 51 is indicated as being of "N" polarity as it
          approaches a magnetic field of "S" polarity. Obviously,
          attraction will occur which will cause the quadrant elements
          to move counterclockwise to rotate shaft 54. This phenomenon
          is easily established by employing a conventional "cow" magnet
          with a coil of wire slidably mounted thereon such that when
          electrical energy is supplied to the coil, the coil, the coil
          will move axially from the magnet so as to be separated
          therefrom as far as possible. </p>
        <p>Sufficient attraction of the leading end of the coils with
          respect to the magnetic fields is available to cause the
          leading or forward side of the coil element to rapidly
          approach the opposite field polarity, to cross the magnetic
          field and to progress beyond after crossover. In some
          instances, depending upon criticality of parts, the coil
          segments would have a tendency to reverse and go back to the
          crossed over polarity field of opposite value. However, in an
          advanced design of the present invention, a plurality of
          stages are provided as shown in FIG. 3, wherein as the coil
          segments associated with the first stage to go beyond the
          magnetic field of opposite polarity, the coil segments of the
          second stage are approaching. This sequence takes place with
          respect to the third and fourth stages as well. </p>
        <p>Referring now to FIG. 3, it can be seen that the shaft 54 is
          rotatably carried on friction-free bearings 55 and 56,
          respectively. The commutators employed for selectively
          energizing the solenoid switches and the coil segments are
          suitably housed within housing 22. Furthermore, it can be seen
          that the wires from the coil segments extend down the quadrant
          webs 52 and 53 and then extend along the shaft 54. It is to be
          noted that the inner diameter of each outer magnet 25 is
          formed with a slot 60 so as to permit the associated webs 52
          and 53 to rotate without encountering interference. Also, it
          can be seen that the magnets are arranged in a series or
          staggered staged relationship. For example, four stages are
          shown in FIG. 3 wherein the coil elements are illustrated in a
          different position from each other so that a continuous and
          smooth work output can be obtained from shaft 54. The
          staggered relationship of adjacent magnets is diagrammatically
          illustrated in FIG. 4 wherein four inner ring magnets are
          illustrated such that the opposing ends of their segments are
          in different axial alignment. All of the ring magnets are
          coaxial with respect to each other but the high density
          magnetic fields are offset with respect to adjacent high
          density magnetic fields. Consequently, the coil elements
          associated with each of the inner ring magnets will be offset
          in a similar fashion as shown in FIG. 3. </p>
        <p>With reference to FIG. 5, an enlarged cross-sectional view of
          a portion of the core or inner magnet 26 is illustrated in
          connection with its spaced relationship to an outer magnet 25
          and a switch mechanism 46. The slot 60 formed in the outer
          magnet 25 is illustrated so as to permit passage of associated
          core element webs 52 and 53 as the magnetic fields attract the
          coil elements. </p>
        <p>Referring now to FIG. 6, a diagrammatic illustration is
          presented in which the pulse energization of the various coils
          50 and 51 are effected by a control means 62, such as a
          commutator that suitably supplies current from a battery 63 to
          the coils 50 and 51 in each stage. Also, the control means
          supplies suitable current to the switch means 42 and 43 as
          well as 46 and 47 so that inner magnetic cores 26 are suitably
          supported as the coils 50 and 51 rotate thereabout in a
          circular manner. A suitable ON/OFF switch 64 is provided. </p>
        <p>From the foregoing, it can be seen that the apparatus of the
          present invention provides a novel magnetic power source
          employing the natural forces of magnetism in such a manner
          that a movable electromagnet will be drawn to a fixed magnetic
          field and caused to pass the fixed magnetic filed so as to
          create mechanical displacement between the fixed magnetic
          field and the movable magnetic field. Such a power source
          represents a tremendous advantage over conventional power
          sources inasmuch as electrical or electronic conversion
          systems are not necessary for the operation of the power
          source. Furthermore, not only can the present invention be
          employed as a magnetic motor but, is is contemplated that
          applications involving generators are included as well. It is
          to be understood that other uses are envisioned by the present
          invention and that additional magnetic stages may be employed
          which will have the advantageous effect of increasing the
          power output from the apparatus. Longevity of the power source
          if a function of the magnetic force available in the permanent
          magnets employed whether they are of the bar magnet type or
          the horseshoe magnet type. </p>
        <p>If desired, rollers may be employed within the gap between
          the inner magnet and the coil portions and in the gap between
          the outer magnet and the coil portions. A magnetic lock is
          effected by the inner hysteresis of the core to be supported
          by the outer magnet. Also, any one stage or level of the
          device may be comprised of two or more magnet segments. It is
          to be noted that in addition to each coil segment 50 and 51
          having opposite polarized ends as previously described, each
          coil carries an external or outward magnetic field which is
          "N" and an inner or inward magnetic field which is indicated
          in FIG. 3 as "S." These minor fields react with the fields of
          the inner core magnet and the outer ring magnet to effectively
          eliminate or substantially reduce drag as the coils move in
          their common circular path. </p>
        <p>while particular embodiments of the present invention have
          been shown and described, it will be obvious to those skilled
          in the art that changes and modifications may be made without
          departing from this invention in its broader aspects and,
          therefore, the aim in the appended claims is to cover all such
          changes and modifications as fall within the true spirit and
          scope of this invention. </p>
