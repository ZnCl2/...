      <p><b>Abstract -- </b>Method of generating electrical power
        without emission of harmful substances from combustion of a
        water-derived fuel gas mixture. An underwater carbon arc
        operated in the absence of hydrocarbons results in a mixture of
        gases, being non-self-combustible but combustible as a fuel gas
        in the presence of air, and comprising gaseous hydrogen in major
        amount and carbon oxides in minor amount, mainly carbon
        monoxide. The fuel gas is adapted, along with air, to run an
        internal combustion engine driving an electrical generator and
        so to provide useful electrical power without the harmful
        emissions usual in combustion of fossil fuels. </p>

      <p>TECHNICAL FIELD </p>
      <p>This invention relates to the generation of electrical power
        without production of harmful emissions encountered in
        conventional generation of electrical power from fossil fuel
        combustion. </p>
      <p>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>At suitable geographical sites, generation of electrical power
        can be accomplished--more or less economically--by converting
        energy available from stream-collected rainfall, tidal, or solar
        sources, substantially free of harmful emissions. More usually,
        electrical power is generated through combustion of fossil
        fuels, whether in gaseous, liquid, or solid form (e.g., natural
        gas, gasoline, coal), but such fuel combustion is accompanied by
        harmful emissions, also in gaseous, liquid, or solid form (e.g.,
        nitrogen oxides, sulfurous acid, carbonaceous particulates).
        Carbon monoxide, often present as a harmful emission in the
        effluent from combustion of a fossil fuel, is so readily
        oxidizable that--when a fuel--it converts readily and
        substantially completely to harmless carbon dioxide upon
        combustion. </p>
      <p>Incompletely combusted carbonaceous fragments or fossil fuel
        combustion by-products--whether gaseous, liquid, or solid--can
        be directly injurious to health of humans and other living
        creatures, as when breathed or ingested in or with food, and can
        be indirectly deleterious, as by altering characteristics of the
        biosphere upon which all living creatures depend. Polluting
        emissions from fossil-fueled factories and vehicles supplement
        those from electrical power plants, so there is an extreme need
        for both stationary and mobile power generation by alternative
        fuels whose combustion does not emit harmful gases, liquids, or
        solids. Combustion products considered harmless (as compared
        with aforementioned or other harmful examples) are notably
        carbon dioxide (gaseous) and water (gaseous or liquid). </p>
      <p>Hydrogen, which has long been considered likely to be an ideal
        fuel because it converts completely to water in ordinary air
        combustion, is not satisfactory as fuel for internal combustion
        engines because it heats intake valves so hot that pre-ignition
        flashback occurs ahead of the combustion chamber, forming
        harmful nitrogen oxides then exhausted as emissions. See, to
        this effect, HYDROGEN STORAGE AND UTILIZATION IN TRANSPORTATION
        VEHICLES--SUMMARY, which was published in 1988 by the
        Alternative Fuels Utilization Program of the Office of
        Transportation Systems in the U.S. Department of Energy,
        including citation of other pertinent references. </p>
      <p>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>A primary object of the present invention is electrical power
        generation without producing harmful emissions in the process. </p>
      <p>Another object of this invention is to drive electrical
        generating equipment by motive means energized by air combustion
        of fuel without producing harmful gaseous, liquid, or solid
        emissions. </p>
      <p>A further object of the invention is to generate, on-site, an
        electrical generator fuel free of harmful emissions when
        combusted. </p>
      <p>Yet another object of this invention is to do the foregoing at
        either stationary or mobile electrical power generation sites. </p>
      <p>A still further object of the invention is to save money while
        generating electrical power from fuel free of harmful emissions.
      </p>
      <p>In general, the objects of the present invention are attained
        by running motive means, such as an internal combustion engine,
        on fuel comprising in major part hydrogen and in substantial
        minor part carbon monoxide so as to drive an electrical
        generator therewith. </p>
      <p>More particularly the fuel comprises about five to seven tenths
        hydrogen and about two to three tenths carbon monoxide. Only
        added air is required to combust the mixture to water and carbon
        dioxide. Internal combustion engines so fueled operate normally
        and are free of the polluting emissions from fossil-fueled
        electrical generation. </p>
      <p>The fuel is derived from electrical carbon arcing under water.
        The negative voltage coefficient of resistance characteristic of
        an arc ensures that, once struck, the arc persists at negligible
        power consumption--and, provided with carbon, can be maintained
        by a fraction of the output of the generator driven by an engine
        so fueled. </p>
      <p>Other objects of the present invention, together with means and
        methods for attaining the various objects, will become apparent
        from the following description and an accompanying diagram of a
        preferred embodiment, presented here by way of example rather
        than limitation. </p>

      <p>DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>FIG. 1 features welder 10 as a high-current electrical power
        source suitable for striking an underwater carbon arc in
        open-top reactor 20. Pair of electrical leads 24, 26 go from the
        welder to and through the sidewall of the reactor and connect at
        terminals 34, 36 across block electrode assembly 30 supported
        level on partition 21. Reactor 20 contains water (dashes) to a
        level (triangle) covering not only the electrode assembly but
        also outlet 22 (near bottom) to water line 42 containing
        filter/pump 44 and leading to heat exchanger 40 (mostly hidden
        behind louvers 43) and back to inlet 28 (near top) at the end of
        return line 48 from the heat exchanger. </p>
      <p>Open-top magazine 50 and surrounding closed-top gas collection
        hood 60, suitably supported, extend downward into the reactor
        from and terminate (open downward) under water just above block
        electrode assembly 30. Carbon rods 51 and 52, aligned upright
        within the magazine, are centered above the electrode assembly,
        with the bottom end of the first rod bridging the narrow edges
        of the respective electrodes (shown later) and with the bottom
        end of the second rod resting on the top end of the first rod.
        Gas fuel takeoff line 65 connects the interior of hood 60 to
        filter 70, from which gas collection line 75 connects to storage
        tank 90 via compressor 80 driven by motor 77, both located on
        top of the storage tank. </p>
      <p>The rest of FIG. 1 shows pressurized fuel tank outlet valve 89
        at the right, connecting the tank through to fuel line 91. This
        fuel line connects via branch lines 93 and 103, containing
        respective valves 92 and 102, to motive means in the form of
        pair of internal combustion engine assemblies 94 and 104. Shaft
        109 from engine 94 connects to generator 110 (shown in block
        form), whereas shaft 107 connects to similarly shown generator
        100 by shaft 107. </p>
      <p>Pair of output electrical leads 95 from left generator 110 go
        to multi-position junction switch 96, from which separately
        switched (i) pair of leads 97 go to welder 10, and (ii) pair of
        leads 98 go to compressor 77 via pressure-switch junction 99 and
        (iii) by branch leads 106 to circulating pump 44. These leads
        conduct DC or single-phase AC power, as most appropriate for the
        intended internal uses. Trio of output leads 105 from right
        generator 100 conduct three-phase power to block 101 designated
        as Output Electrical AC Load. The respective engines and their
        associated generators may take the well known compact form of
        motor-generator assemblies; alternative motive means may include
        burners and/or boilers heated by combustion of the fuel, plus
        engines actuated by the burning gases or by steam. </p>
      <p>FIG. 2 shows fragmentarily, in perspective, block electrode
        assembly 30 on partition 21 of the reactor (as in FIG. 1 but
        larger). Central opening 35 in the partition is as wide as the
        spacing between the narrow edges of respective wedge-shaped
        electrodes 31, 32. The rounded lower end of rod 51 is nearing
        the opening, which it will bridge as the arc is struck across
        the electrodes and through it when power is applied across the
        electrodes at terminals 34, 36. Water is omitted as unnecessary
        to an understanding of this view, but it will be understood to
        be present, with the further understanding that an arc struck
        between the underwater carbon electrodes and through the carbon
        rod heats the water drastically and decomposes it into
        constituent hydrogen and oxygen and also that the oxygen reacts
        with carbon to produce gaseous carbon monoxide and carbon
        dioxide. The next view will aid understanding of the ensuing
        procedure, both the steps giving rise to the fuel production,
        and the subsequent steps of converting the fuel with air into
        output electrical energy. </p>
      <p>FIG. 3 shows, in block form, a flow diagram of steps that take
        place in the practice of this invention. The fuel generation
        steps predominate in the upper part of the view. The fuel
        conversion and power generation steps predominate in the lower
        part of the view. </p>
      <p>Sequential steps in the fuel generation part of this invention
        include (1) TURN ON HIGH CURRENT POWER SUPPLY, (2) START ARC
        UNDER WATER, (3) FEED CARBON RODS, (4) EVOLVE GASES, (5) COLLECT
        GASES, (6) FILTER OUT CARBON PARTICLES, (7) COMPRESS FUEL GASES,
        and (8) STORE COMPRESSED FUEL. The last two mentioned steps are
        performed upon the evolved, partly reacted, mixture of
        constituent and byproduct gases. Accessory composite steps (9)
        COOL AND FILTER WATER maintain water conditions as desired,
        especially at the hot underwater arc locus of gas
        evolution--from which evolved gases bubble up through the
        intervening water, heating it, and into the overlying hood, to
        be drawn off and stored for fuel use as indicated. </p>
      <p>Sequential steps in the center of FIG. 3 include arrows and
        lines from the Store Compressed Fuel step downward to the lower
        part of the view, and a pair of symmetrically located steps,
        (16) COMBUST MINORITY OF FUEL (at left) and--at right--(11)
        COMBUST MAJORITY OF FUEL. Succeeding the latter step are the
        sequential steps of (12) DRIVE MAJOR GENERATOR, (13) GENERATE
        EXTERNAL 30 AC. A final arrow on the right terminates at (14)
        EXTERNAL LOADS. To the left from the step (15) COMBUST MINORITY
        OF FUEL are the sequential steps of (16) DRIVE MINOR GENERATOR
        and (17) GENERATE INTERNAL AC/DC terminating at (18) INTERNAL
        LOADS. </p>
      <p>Practicing this invention is readily apparent from FIGS. 1 to 3
        and the foregoing description. Underwater arcing occurs when an
        electrical potential (AC or preferably DC) such as common in
        steel welding is applied across the block electrodes, which
        preferably are composed essentially of graphite--preferably with
        a conductive rod (itself mainly carbon) substantially bridging
        the gap between them. </p>
      <p>Precisely what happens in arc-induced decomposition of water is
        not well understood, though the resulting fuel and its
        combustion products have been ascertained. To the extent that
        this specification interprets decomposition or combustion
        processes, or accounts for the presence of certain products and
        absence of others, it is to be understood as theoretical or
        academic rather than definitive. </p>
      <p>The mixture of gases so evolved and collected according to the
        present invention contains (by volume) gaseous hydrogen in major
        amount, such as from about five to about seven tenths, and
        carbon monoxide in substantial minor amount, such as from about
        two to about three tenths. Up to about a tenth to an eighth of
        the mixture may be made up mainly of carbon dioxide and to a
        minor extent of gaseous oxygen--the latter in an amount
        insufficient for the mixture of gases to be self-combustible
        (rarely more than several percent). </p>
      <p>A representative analysis of the fuel gas of this invention can
        be expected to show about five-eighths gaseous hydrogen, two
        eighths carbon monoxide, with the rest made up of the other
        mentioned gases. </p>
      <p>Oxides of nitrogen and sulfur common in combustion products of
        gases from fossil fuels and in hydrogen combustion are missing
        or minimal because, first, there is no possible source other
        than air or water and, second, the carbon monoxide content
        effectively cools and evens out the hydrogen combustion so as to
        preclude its usual intake valve overheating, plus flashback and
        hyperoxidative effects. </p>
      <p>The carbon dioxide content is held down by substantial absence
        of hydrocarbons, oils, or other organic chemicals, such as
        otherwise might combine with the oxygen released by water
        decomposition in the reactor. The modest amount of resulting
        gaseous oxygen in the fuel of this invention may have been
        dissolved in the water initially. </p>
      <p>Carbon in the resultant gaseous mixture preferably comes mainly
        from the rod used to bridge the block electrodes. Alternatively
        it may be fed to the arc site in particulate form with like
        effect. </p>
      <p>The resulting fuel gas burns upon access to air in effective
        amount, evenly with substantially clear flame and no sooting. In
        its gaseous state it can fuel an internal combustion engine
        without need for an atomizing carburetor or injection nozzle.
        Such engine may be of jet, piston, turbine, or other type. With
        an interposed boiler, steam may be generated from water for
        turbine engine use. </p>
      <p>The water to be decomposed in the process of this invention is
        not subject to any unusual requirement, and most fresh water
        sources can be expected to prove satisfactory, or salt water can
        be used. Content of petroleum products or other organic
        materials should be avoided as they might contaminate the
        resulting fuel gas. </p>
      <p>No unusual materials of construction are needed in apparatus of
        this invention. The reactor need be only a structurally sound
        tank, such as steel or other metal, and is preferably grounded.
        The hood to receive the evolved gases, and the magazine to hold
        and dispense the rods, are conveniently made of metal, plastic,
        or ceramic. The magazine may accommodate any convenient number
        of rods, conveniently loaded upright side-by-side on an inside
        surface slanting down to an exit directly above the desired
        electrode-bridging location so as to fed by gravity, although
        automatic feed may be adopted if preferred. </p>
      <p>The rods themselves may be common welding rods, composed mainly
        of particulate carbon held together by a conventional binder. As
        also noted, the electrode blocks are solid graphite, also
        generally available for use in welding and other
        high-temperature environments and/or high-pressure environments
        requiring chemical inertness. </p>
      <p>The toxicity of carbon monoxide should not pose any problem.
        Caution is essential in the handling and use of any fuel, so it
        is expected to be exercised in the instance of this fuel gas as
        well. </p>
      <p>The combustion products of gaseous hydrogen and carbon monoxide
        are respectively simply water and carbon dioxide, so clean
        burning is an understandable characteristic of the resulting
        fuel gas, as is the preference for exclusion of organic
        materials generally. Other advantages include the fact that
        water and carbon are relatively low-cost inputs. Similarly, the
        power required to decompose water is readily available at
        reasonable cost in at least most locations. </p>
      <p>The electrical potential applied across the underwater arc is
        preferably DC (direct-current) rather than AC (alternating
        current). Conventional welding equipment operates from standard
        line-power AC (usually 3-phase) input, and yields a DC or AC
        output, as desired. For present purposes a DC output of at least
        several dozens of volts across the electrodes is preferred.
        External rectification of AC is readily accomplished, as in
        welding apparatus, for example. AC to DC conversion without
        moving parts and with an improved output may be accomplished
        according to Luce U.S. Pat. No. 4,870,558. </p>
      <p>If a conventional power source is objectionable because
        dependent upon fossil fuels, part of the electrical power output
        can be applied to maintain the arc, and a small part can even be
        stored, as in a battery or a large capacitor, to restart the arc
        at any time. </p>
      <p>Motive means to be actuated by combustion of the fuel, whether
        directly by resulting temperature increase and associated
        expansion in volume, or indirectly by conversion of water to
        steam and similar use of the change-of-state volume expansion,
        may be conventional. A conventional motor-generator may be used
        as both motive means and electrical generating means, as its
        name suggests. Three-phase and single-phase AC motor-generator
        outputs are available. DC output can be provided by rectifying
        AC output, preferably without adding moving parts. Motor
        generators are readily available with multi-phase output (AC).
        Single-phase AC generators are available, some with optional DC.
      </p>
      <p>The external electrical loads may be any downstream electrical
        equipment external to the system. The internal electrical loads
        include the water cooling means, water circulating means, and
        gas compressing means--and may include the arc as well, once the
        arc is operating. so as to make the system self-contained. </p>
      <p>It should be understood that this invention provides a key to
        unlocking stored chemical energy by applying considerable
        electrical energy for a very short time and a smaller amount for
        a much longer time, and by adding chemical energy in the form of
        cheap carbon, air, and water to obtain more (and more valuable)
        electricity. This method should not be understood as violating
        any accepted scientific principle, but only as applying science
        to economic advantage, as facilitated by the negative voltage
        coefficient of electric arcs. </p>
      <p>The accepted view of internal combustion engines as inefficient
        should be substantially redirected to the combustion
        inefficiency of fossil fuels. The fuel of the present invention
        greatly improves engine operation and benefits the environment
        by absence of the customary polluting emissions. These benefits
        are attributable mainly to the increased efficiency of
        combustion of this fuel supplemental to the minimal power
        requirement for converting inexpensive input materials into the
