        <p><b>Abstract -- </b>Mechanically or electrically driven
          vehicles suitable for air, land, or sea transport are operated
          substantially pollution-free on a fuel gas derived by
          pyrolysis of carbon and water via underwater arcing between
          electrodes, optionally on-board. A carbon rod may serve as an
          electrode or preferably be inserted end-on between a plurality
          of electrodes, preferably composed of graphite. The fuel is
          combusted in an engine having mechanical output useful
          directly as motive power for the vehicle or indirectly to
          operate a generator of electrical output to motors driving the
          vehicle motive means. </p>

        <p>TECHNICAL FIELD </p>
        <p>This invention relates to motor vehicles powered by
          combustion engines and operable substantially pollution-free
          on given fuel gas. </p>
        <p>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </p>
        <p>Combustion effluents of fossil fuels, such as coal, petroleum
          (including diesel oil, kerosene, jet fuel, and gasoline), and
          even natural gas, contain, in addition to customary carbon
          dioxide and water, undesirable hydrocarbon fragments and
          derivatives, often in particulate form, carbon monoxide, and
          gaseous oxides of nitrogen and/or of sulfur transformable to
          noxious droplet form (acid rain). </p>
        <p>Hydrogen was long-considered an ideal fuel because
          convertible completely to water via air combustion. See
          century-old Eldridge U.S. Pat. No. 603,058 for an Electrical
          Retort wherein an air arc flashed water to steam then
          pyrolyzed it and electrode carbon. Yet hydrogen is
          unsatisfactory as fuel for an internal-combustion engine
          because it heats the intake valves--ahead of the combustion
          chamber--and causes pre-ignition flashback, which is
          deleterious to the engine operation and structure, and is
          conducive to emission of harmful nitrogen oxides (aptly:
          "NOx") into the atmosphere. An instructive reference is
          HYDROGEN STORAGE AND UTILIZATION IN TRANSPORTATION
          VEHICLES--SUMMARY, United States Department of Energy,
          Alternative Fuels Utilization Program, Office of
          Transportation Systems (1988). </p>
        <p>Many places are polluted by emissions from combustion of
          fossil fuels by motor vehicles, lawnmowers, heating systems,
          manufacturing plants, or electricity generation, despite many
          laws and safeguards. My invention is the first and (so far)
          only solution to the problem. </p>
        <p>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </p>
        <p>A primary object of the present invention is operation of
          motor vehicles without pollution of the environment. </p>
        <p>Another object of this invention is to fuel combustion in
          such a way that it is substantially free of harmful emissions.
        </p>
        <p>A further object of the invention is to enable substantially
          pollution-free operation of internal-combustion engines. </p>
        <p>Yet another object of the invention is to enable motor
          vehicles to generate on-board fuel for electrical or
          mechanical motive power. </p>
        <p>A still further object of the invention is to render
          production of electrical energy for use by motor vehicles more
          environmentally friendly than electrical generation
          customarily is nowadays. </p>
        <p>A still further object of this invention is to accomplish the
          foregoing objects more economically than possible with fossil
          fuels, preferably taking into account environmental as well as
          other costs. </p>
        <p>In general, the objects of this invention are attained using
          fuel gas combustible substantially completely to carbon
          dioxide and water vapor, usually in an internal-combustion
          engine or equivalent. </p>
        <p>That fuel preferably is generated by underwater carbon
          arcing, wherein both carbon and water are pyrolyzed into
          gaseous condition and air-combustible to carbon dioxide and
          water, free of pollutants. </p>
        <p>More particularly, motor vehicles are fueled according to
          this invention and thereby enabled to combust the fuel
          pollution-free and to be driven either directly through
          engine-produced motive power or indirectly by electricity
          generated by engine-produced motive power. </p>
        <p>In addition, this invention enables vehicles with
          considerable fuel requirements to produce fuel gas on
          board--advantageous for sea transport vessels as well as for
          trans-continental trains or trucks. </p>
        <p>Other objects of the present invention, together with means
          and methods for attaining the various objects, will become
          apparent from the following description and the accompanying
          diagrams of preferred embodiments, presented by way of example
          rather than limitation. </p>

        <p>DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </p>
        <p>FIG. 1 shows, in schematic side elevation, partly in section,
          an embodiment of apparatus 10 adapted to evolve, collect,
          compress, and liquefy fuel gas of this invention. It features,
          at the left, electrical meter 12 connected to an external
          source (not shown) of electrical power via pair of leads 11,
          and connected by pair of leads 13 to welder 14, with
          heavy-duty electrical output adjustable by setting of arm 15
          on dial 16, and connected by pair of heavily insulated leads
          17, 19 to respective electrodes 27, 24 in tank 20. The tank is
          filled with water (shading) to level 28 near its top. </p>
        <p>FIG. 2 shows details of part of the apparatus in tank 20 of
          FIG. 1 on an enlarged scale, including especially lead 17
          connected to graphite block electrode 27, lying on insulating
          slab 27 on raised floor 26 of the tank, whereas lead 19
          connects to the lower end of oblique magazine 24--partly
          sectioned away to show (shaded) contactor portion 29 of the
          magazine, fitting closely around carbon rod 25 to assure
          electrical contact just above its protruding lower end.
          Cylindrical hood 30, upright on support 31 upstanding from the
          bottom of tank 20, is open at its submerged bottom end in the
          water above the nearest approach of the magazine to the block
          electrode. </p>
        <p>FIG. 1 also shows, cylinder 21 (inert flushing gas) with
          valve 22 connected by tubing 23 to the upper end of magazine
          24, which is capable of holding at least several carbon rods
          and is covered by cap 25 except during loading of the rods.
          Fuel transport tube 32 connects the top of gas-collecting hood
          30 through in-line isolation valve 33 and compression pump 39
          to three-way distribution valve 39, openable either to upper
          branch line 4 or to lower branch line 41. The upper branch
          line leads from the distribution valve to coupling 5 of fuel
          gas storage container 6 having pressure valve 7 thereon.
          Successive containers may be connected to the line for
          filling, and be disconnected therefrom for storage when
          filled. </p>
        <p>Lower branch line 41 from distribution valve 39 leads to the
          top of condenser 40 inside insulating jacket 45, where it
          connects to the top end of helical condenser tube 43, whose
          bottom end connects via outlet tube 49 to (liquid fuel)
          container 60. The helical tube is surrounded by condenser
          jacket 42, which has vent tube 41 at its upper end and is
          supplied at its lower end with coolant from tank 50 (valve not
          shown) via tube 51 and branch tube 52. Branch tube 53, when
          its valve 54 is open, feeds coolant around container 60 in
          insulated box 68, with vent 61 and cover 62, on balance base
          69 with scale 65--for weight of the container and its
          contents. </p>
        <p>FIG. 3 shows internal-combustion engine apparatus 70, with
          cooling radiator at the left. Engine 75 is fed with fuel gas
          boiling off from container 60 via outlet tube 67 through valve
          72 and to the engine intake via tube 74. Air reaches the
          engine from the atmosphere via adjacent adapter or butterfly
          valve 73. Drive shaft 76 connects engine motive output to
          gearbox or electrical generator 77. </p>
        <p>It will be understood that motor vehicles, such as
          automobiles, locomotives, tractors, and trucks, may be
          operated by application of conventional motive output from a
          combustion engine to their driving wheels, or alternatively
          may be operated by application of motive output to electrical
          generating equipment whose electrical output operates motors
          mechanically connected to such vehicle drive wheels. This
          invention is adapted equally well to such so-called "hybrid"
          motor vehicles as well as those with conventional mechanical
          drives. </p>
        <p>Aircraft and watercraft may be propelled similarly, whether
          by motive output from a combustion engine or by equivalent
          electrical driving of propeller or screw means (cf. drive
          wheels). Not only may ships burn the fuel gas of this
          invention in the combustion chambers of steam boilers or in
          formerly diesel-fueled engines, but aircraft also may run on
          this fuel instead of jet fuel or gasoline. </p>
        <p>FIG. 4 shows, in block form, a flow diagram of this
          invention, with fuel generation steps predominating nearest
          the top, and fuel conversion and power generation steps near
          the bottom, of the view. </p>
        <p>Sequential steps in the fuel generation part of this
          invention include (1) TURN ON HIGH CURRENT POWER SUPPLY, (2)
          START ARC UNDER WATER, (3) FEED CARBON RODS, (4) EVOLVE GASES,
          (5) COLLECT GASES, (6) FILTER OUT CARBON PARTICLES, (7)
          COMPRESS FUEL GASES, and (8) STORE COMPRESSED FUEL. The last
          two mentioned steps are performed upon the evolved fuel gas.
          Accessory composite steps (9) COOL AND FILTER WATER maintain
          water conditions as desired, especially at the hot underwater
          arc locus of gas evolution--from which evolved gases bubble up
          through intervening water, heating it, and into the overlying
          hood, to be collected and stored for fuel use as indicated. </p>
        <p>Subsequent sequential steps in FIG. 4 include arrows and
          lines from the Store Compressed Fuel step downward to the
          lower part of the view, and a pair of symmetrically located
          steps, (16) COMBUST MINORITY OF FUEL (at left), and (11)
          COMBUST MAJORITY OF FUEL. Next are the sequential steps of
          (12) DRIVE MAJOR GENERATOR, (13) GENERATE EXTERNAL 3.O
          slashed. AC. A final arrow on the right terminates at (14)
          EXTERNAL LOADS. To the left from the step (15) COMBUST
          MINORITY OF FUEL are the sequential steps of (16) DRIVE MINOR
          GENERATOR and (17) GENERATE INTERNAL AC/DC terminating at (18)
          INTERNAL LOADS. </p>
        <p>The fuel gas input materials are inexpensive carbon and
          water. Also required is a source of electrical energy
          sufficient to strike an underwater arc, which is readily
          maintained with little energy input because of its negative
          temperature coefficient of resistance. Once struck, the arc is
          readily maintained, and requires much less energy input than
          is subsequently obtainable as output by combustion of the fuel
          gas evolved via the high-temperature (5-6000.degree. F.) arc.
        </p>
        <p>FIG. 5 shows, in schematic side elevation, a filling station
          (at right) providing fuel of this invention to truck 70 (at
          left). The truck has cab 74 and engine compartment 78 forward,
          and cargo compartment 77 aft, on flat bed 75 supported via
          springs on pair of front wheels 71 and two pairs of rear drive
          wheels 72 connected by suitable means (not shown) to engine
          73, whose muffler and exhaust pipe 79 are upright behind the
          cab. Fuel tank 76 is slung underneath the bed below the cab
          with fuel line (hidden) to the engine. </p>
        <p>Filling station building 101 houses embodiment 100 of
          apparatus for evolving, collecting, and compressing fuel gas
          according to this invention, including electric welder 114,
          water tank 102, electrodes (not noted), circulating pump 103,
          and water-cooling heat-exchanger 104. Gas-collecting hood 106
          is connected in turn to particulate (in-line) filter 107,
          compressor 108, and storage tank 109. Fuel delivery line 118
          connects the stored fuel to metering pump 119, and fuel
          filling line 120 connects in turn to truck fuel compartment
          76. </p>
        <p>FIGS. 5 and 6 do not try to show connection of engine motive
          output to drive wheels, or indeed via electrical connection,
          as from a generator run by the engine, to electric motors
          adjunct to the wheels to drive them, both arrangements being
          conventional by now. </p>
        <p>FIG. 6 shows semi-trailer 90 connected at its front end to
          tractor 80, by hitch 86 on flat bed 85 of the tractor, and
          supported at its rear end by a double pair of wheels 92. The
          tractor resembles the front end and undercarriage of the truck
          of the preceding view in having cab 84 and engine compartment
          88 forward on flat bed 85. The bed is supported via springs on
          pair of front wheels 81 and twin pairs of rear drive wheels 82
          connected by means (not shown here) to engine 83, with fuel
          compartment 86 slung underneath. The trailer, supported at its
          front end by the tractor, has lateral bulkhead 97 (broken
          line) dividing it into large rear cargo compartment 98 and
          small forward on-board fuel-manufacturing compartment 96,
          containing fuel evolving, collecting, compressing, and storage
          means of this invention, such as shown to some extent in the
          filling station, or in modified detail in FIG. 1.
          Fuel-manufacturing compartment 96, shown at about one-fifth of
          the trailer length, may be more compact. </p>
        <p>FIG. 7 shows electric drive arrangement 110, wherein motor
          111 connects by drive belt 115 to drive wheel 112, which
          otherwise would be driven by conventional mechanical
          connection from the engine. The motor is a FIG. 4 external
          load operable by FIG. 3 generator 77. </p>
        <p>The electrode embodiment shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, wherein rod
          25 is one of the electrodes, was selected originally as more
          suitable for location in a moving vehicle, whose movement
          might be conducive to dislodging or misaligning a free rod.
          More recent comparison of that arrangement vs. plural fixed
          planar electrodes bridged by a (non-electrode) carbon rod
          suggests that the latter is preferable. Successive rods are
          constrained only to be fed (mainly by gravity) to that general
          location and otherwise are free to move axially up and down
          along, and rotate about their, preferably, vertical axis. </p>
        <p>FIGS. 8A, 8B, and 8C show, in front and side elevations and
          in sectional plan, alternative multi-electrode free-rod
          embodiment 220. As shown most fully in FIG. 8A, twin stands
          221, 229 rise upright from baffle 259, to support axles 222,
          228 in bearings (not shown) in the horizontal tops of the
          stands. Disk-like electrodes 224, 226 retained on enlarged
          holders 223, 227 on the tops of the axles form gap 225 at the
          closest approach to each other. The peripheral edges of the
          disks are tapered so that at their top the perimeter is less
          than their bottom perimeter. </p>
        <p>Intruding, from above, down into the gap and into contact
          with edges of both electrodes is rod end 241 (also shown
          tapered here) emerging from discharge tube 244 of magazine 40
          (hidden here). The axles also carry at their lower ends,
          within the respective stands, respective pinion gears 212 and
          218 engaged by drive gears 202 and 207, carried on respective
          bracket-supported bearings (208 shown here for gear 228) for
          aligned shafts 215 and 217 interconnected by swivel 216. The
          shafts interconnect via universal joint 214 to shaft 213 and
          are rotatable by turning manual rotary crank handle 211 (top
          left), indicative of possible automated equivalent means. It
          is apparent that, upon such like rotation of the electrode
          disks, their edges at closest approach are moving in opposite
          directions. Thus, the rod will tend to rotate about its axis
          from such contact. </p>
        <p>FIGS. 9A and 9B show another electrode assembly embodiment
          270, from side and top, which differs from the last previous
          embodiment mainly by having the disklike electrodes mounted on
          (and rotatable about) a single horizontal axis in place of the
          prior vertical axes, and by substituting a motor drive for the
          previous manual rotation. Thus, twin angle brackets 271, 279
          rise upright from baffle 259 to which they are bolted, to
          support axles 273, 277 in bearings (not shown) in the vertical
          parts of the stands. Pair of disklike electrodes 274, 276 are
          mounted on those horizontal axle shafts of waterproofed
          gear-drive motors 272, 278, with gap 275 at their closest
          approach to each other. The tip of rod 281 protrudes from the
          bottom end of discharge tube 284 and intrudes from above into
          the gap and into contact with edges of both electrodes.
          Winglike flanges 282, 288, retained against the angle
          brackets, are slip-ring plates connected to the power supply,
          which extend over axles 273, 277 to protect them from the arc.
        </p>
        <p>The operation of the apparatus of this invention is
          understood readily from the FIG. 4 summary, in view of the
          description and the accompanying diagrams. Reference numerals
          are omitted from a more detailed description with special
          application to the multi-electrode embodiments onto which a
          succession of carbon rods is dispensed from a suitable
          magazine holding a supply of such conductive rods. </p>
        <p>The electrode disks are assembled to their respective axles
          and the reactor is filled with enough water to submerge the
          electrodes. With energizing electricity (in the range of at
          least several dozen volts to between about 50 v. and a 100 v.)
          across the electrodes, a first conductive rod is lowered
          toward the gap, and when the rod tip gets close enough an
          electric arc bridges the electrodes. Bubbles of gas evolve and
          rise to the surface of the water. Successive bubbles collect
          above the water under the hood and are pumped from there
          through a segregation tank to a large tank for storage under a
          pressure up to several thousand p.s.i. or a couple hundred
          kg/cm.sup.2. </p>
        <p>High-temperature arcing occurs--even under water--when
          adequate AC or DC electrical potential, whichever is more
          readily available or may be preferred for some operational
          reason, is applied across a pair of electrodes, here
          preferably made substantially of graphite. Pyrolysis ensues,
          and some of the highly heated water dissociates into its
          component hydrogen and oxygen; also much carbon vaporizes.
          Some of the carbon oxidizes to its monoxide, and some of the
          carbon and/or some of the carbon monoxide oxidizes to carbon
          dioxide. If the electrodes were less wetted (as in Eldridge,
          supra) instead of being immersed in excess water--as here--the
          predominant carbon oxide would prove disappointingly to be
          dioxide instead of monoxide. </p>
        <p>The water in the reactor tends to get progressively hotter
          but is kept relatively cool, preferably about 140.degree. F.
          (60.degree. C.) by heatexchange in the temperature-control
          system, enabling the generation of steam for whatever use and
          the condensation of potable water from the steam whether
          formed from brackish, polluted, or even sea water. </p>
        <p>Both the conductive rod and the electrodes are consumed bit
          by bit by the electric arc, as is the water, whose level is
          maintained above the arc by added water or recirculation of
          steam condensate. The rods are consumed relatively rapidly and
          are fed in succession from the magazine above the reactor. The
          electrodes, being consumed more slowly, are rotated, either
          intermittently or continuously, so as to distribute their
          erosion evenly along their peripheral edges. Rotation of the
          electrodes about either vertical or horizontal axes (or
          alternatively about oblique axes) rotates the rods by either
          continual or intermittent contact, so the electrodes also
          erode fairly evenly. When the electrodes have eroded close to
          their axles the reactor will be shut down temporarily to
          enable electrode replacement and appropriate maintenance, such
          as reactor cleaning. </p>
        <p>How to make, store, and use the fuel of the present invention
          is readily apparent from this description and foregoing
          diagrams. However, what happens in the electrical arc is not
          well understood, and need not be understood in order to
          practice this invention. To the extent that this specification
          suggests what occurs in or as a consequence of the arc, or
          interprets decomposition, recombination, or combustion
          processes, or suggests why the resulting fuel gas has or lacks
          certain characteristics or certain compositions, that text
          should be understood as being academic, speculative, or
          theoretical. </p>
        <p>In contrast, operational features of this invention,
          sufficient to enable its practice by persons of at least
          ordinary skill in the relevant arts, are specified here and
          are readily understandable. </p>
        <p>The water to be decomposed in the process of this invention
          is not subject to any unusual requirement. Most water sources
          prove satisfactory, including brackish or salt--as well as
          fresh--water, but water containing petroleum or other organics
          should be avoided, as they may be decomposed or be combined or
          reconstituted in forms not conducive to pollution-free
          operation of internal-combustion or other engines when
          operated on the fuel obtained by this invention. </p>
        <p>The fuel gas so evolved and collected according to the
          present invention appears, from physical and chemical
          analyses, to comprise (by volume) gaseous hydrogen in major
          amount, as from about three to about five eighths, carbon
          monoxide in predominant minor amount, as from about two to
          about three eighths, and lesser amounts of other gases, such
          as carbon dioxide, hydrocarbons (or other organics), nitrogen,
          or oxygen--the latter in concentration insufficient for
          self-combustion. A representative sample might well be about
          half hydrogen, a third carbon monoxide, and the remainder
          other gases. </p>
        <p>Carbon dioxide content is held down by presence of excess
          water (providing ample oxygen) and by substantial absence of
          long-chain hydrocarbons, such as otherwise might break down
          partially and then combine with oxygen released by the
          arc-induced water decomposition. Any hydrocarbon present is
          presumably so simple that it combusts to carbon dioxide and
          water without occupying any in-between status. </p>
        <p>This fuel gas burns easily and evenly, with adequate access
          to air (about a half dozen times the fuel volume), and can
          operate an internal combustion engine without carburetor or
          injection nozzle. Conversion of gasoline vehicles to this
          gaseous fuel, however, may be facilitated by use of a gas fuel
          adapter. Suitable adapters are available from Garretson
          Equipment Co., Inc., Mt. Pleasant, Iowa. Also note Garretson
          U.S. Pat. No. 3,974,851; 4,375,798; 4,829,957. </p>
        <p>The effluent from combustion of the fuel of this invention is
          substantially entirely carbon dioxide gas and water vapor, as
          shown by analyses of effluent from lawnmower and automobile
          engines fueled with it. Hydrocarbon fragments in any form are
          conspicuous by their absence, as are all particulates,
          presumably because of the facility of complete combustion of
          the simple components of the fuel gas. A possibility of
          hydrocarbon contamination exists from currently used
          petroleum-based lubricants, or from loosening of carbonized
          deposits of formerly used lubricants and fuels, especially in
          old engines. </p>
        <p>Oxides of nitrogen, common in combustion products of gases
          from fossil fuels or of hydrogen alone, are missing (or
          minimal) because there is no possible source other than air,
          and the carbon monoxide content effectively cools and evens
          out combustion in the engine so as to preclude their
          generation by intake valve overheating, flash-back, or other
          hyperoxidative characteristic of hydrogen combustion. </p>
        <p>Carbon monoxide is not found in the effluent, notwithstanding
          its content in the fuel itself, because carbon monoxide
          oxidizes so readily to carbon dioxide. Carbon monoxide in
          automobile exhaust gases results from insufficient combustion
          of gasoline hydrocarbons. </p>
        <p>Indeed, an internal-combustion engine running on this fuel
          can be located in an occupied room without harming the
          occupants, as its operation normally reduces pre-existing
          concentration of ordinary pollutants in the ambient atmosphere
          (the combustion air source), so such engine operation cleans
          the air rather than contaminating it. The distinction between
          gasoline operation of an internal-combustion engine and its
          operation on the fuel gas of this invention has to be seen and
          smelled to be believed--and enjoyed. Effluent analysis by
          competent objective analysts has confirmed the merits of this
          fuel. Carbon monoxide is essentially completely absent from
          the effluent, as are unburned particulates, whether of carbon
          or hydrocarbons. Of course, continued operation would convert
          oxygen progressively into carbon dioxide, which--though
          harmless--will not support human life. </p>
        <p>The odor of the gas evolved in practicing this invention is
          not readily identifiable but is compatible with minimal
          organic content, and perhaps trace(s) of ethylenic and/or
          acetylenic hydrocarbon(s). If the electrodes were
          non-carbonaceous, all of the participating carbon would have
          to be introduced into the arc in rod, particulate, or other
          suitable form, and the fuel so obtained could not reasonably
          be expected to be equivalent to the fuel of my invention. </p>
        <p>The fuel gas of this invention appears to have leak-resistant
          capability by diffusing through semi-permeable membranes more
          slowly than its presumed component compositions do.
          Comparative testing in balloons of elastomeric material
          against like balloons filled with air, helium, or nitrogen can
          demonstrate this remarkable property. </p>
        <p>Chemical and physical analyses of this fuel gas have failed
          to account for its apparent leak-resistant property.
          Speculation about possible presence of gaseous polymers,
          fullerenes, etc. has ensued. As already indicated, structural
          explanations of properties are not essential to production and
          use of the fuel gas of this invention. </p>
        <p>No unusual materials of construction are needed in apparatus
          of this invention. The reactor need be only a structurally
          sound tank, such as steel or other metal, and is preferably
          grounded. The hood to receive the evolved gases may be
          separate from or combined with the tank. The magazine to hold
          and dispense carbon rods also may be made of metal, plastic,
          or ceramic. The magazine may accommodate any convenient number
          of rods, conveniently loaded at least partly upright,
          side-by-side on an inside surface slanting down to an exit
          directly above the desired electrode-bridging location, so as
          to be fed by gravity, although automatic feed may be adopted
          if preferred. </p>
        <p>At present, graphite is preferred for the electrodes, and the
          rods may be composed mainly or exclusively of particulate
          carbon, preferably without added binder. Both are generally
          available, as for use in welding and other high-temperature
          environments and/or high-pressure environments requiring
          substantial chemical inertness. </p>
        <p>Both water and carbon are relatively low-cost inputs, and the
          power required to pyrolize water is readily available at
          reasonable cost in at least most locations. The electrical
          potential applied across the underwater arc may be either DC
          (direct-current) or AC (alternating current). Conventional
          welding equipment operates from standard line-power AC
          (usually 3-phase) input, and yields a DC or AC output, as
          desired. AC to DC conversion without moving parts and with an
          improved output may be accomplished more elegantly according
          to Luce U.S. Pat. No. 4,870,558. </p>
        <p>If a conventional power source is objectionable because
          dependent upon fossil fuels, part of the electrical power
          output can be applied to maintain the arc, and a small part
          can even be stored, as in a battery or a large capacitor, to
          restart the arc at any time. The chemical energy available by
          burning the fuel is so much greater than the energy required
          to maintain the arc as to be economical. </p>
        <p>Preferred embodiments and variants have been suggested for
          this invention. Other modifications may be made, as by adding,
          combining, deleting, or subdividing compositions, parts, or
          steps, while retaining all or some of the advantages and
          benefits of the present invention--which itself is defined in
          the following claims.<br>
