      <p><b>Abstract -- </b>Water-derived fuel gas. An underwater
        carbon arc operated in the absence of hydrocarbons results in a
        mixture of gases, being non-self-combustible but combustible as
        a fuel gas in the presence of air, and comprising gaseous
        hydrogen in major amount and carbon oxides in minor amount,
        predominantly carbon monoxide. The fuel gas is adapted along
        with air to run an internal combustion engine, and along with
        oxygen to operate a cutting or welding torch.</p>

      <p>TECHNICAL FIELD </p>
      <p>This invention relates to water-derived gases, especially a
        fuel gas mixture resulting from underwater electrical carbon
        arcing. </p>
      <p>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>Underwater electrical arcing is known to be conducive to
        production of hydrogen gas, as disclosed in U.S. patents to
        Eldridge et al. 603,058 and Carr et al. U.S. Pat. No. 4,233,132.
        Both of them are interested almost exclusively in collection of
        hydrogen gas--and undertake to see that other components are
        absent, reacted, or otherwise removed. </p>
      <p>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>A primary object of the present invention is to derive from
        underwater electrical carbon arcing a non-self-combustible gas
        mixture combustible in the presence of air. </p>
      <p>Another object of this invention is to produce in that manner a
        fuel gas rich in gaseous hydrogen and carbon monoxide. </p>
      <p>A further object of the invention is to run internal combustion
        engines on such fuel gas. </p>
      <p>Yet another object is to use such a fuel gas in welding metals.
      </p>
      <p>A still further object is to achieve the aforementioned objects
        in economical fashion. </p>
      <p>In general the objects of the present invention are attained by
        collecting gases evolved from underwater carbon arcing. </p>
      <p>More particularly, the objects of this invention are embodied
        in a fuel gas rich in gaseous hydrogen and carbon monoxide, and
        low in content of gaseous oxygen and carbon dioxide. </p>
      <p>Other objects of the present invention, together with means and
        methods for attaining the various objects, will become apparent
        from the following description and the accompanying diagrams of
        preferred embodiments presented here by way of example rather
        than limitation. </p>

      <p>DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>FIG. 1 shows in schematic elevation apparatus for evolving and
        collecting a mixture of gases as the fuel gas of this invention.
        At the left is welder 10 as an exemplified high-current power
        supply. Pair of electrical leads 24, 26 go to and through
        reactor wall 20 and connect at terminals 34, 36 across block
        electrode assembly 30 (detailed in FIG. 2) supported on
        horizontal partition 21. </p>
      <p>Reactor 20 contains water (dashes) to a high level (triangle)
        covering not only the electrode assembly but outlet 22 near the
        bottom to water line 42 containing filter/pump 44 and leading to
        heat exchanger 40 hidden by louvers 42 and on to inlet 48 (near
        top) at the end of return line 48 from the heat exchanger. Rod
        magazine 50 and concentric gas collection hood 60 enter the
        reactor from the top and terminate under water above block
        electrode assembly 30. First and second rods 51 and 52, aligned
        upright within the magazine, are centered above the electrode
        assembly, with the bottom end of the first rod bridging the
        narrow edges of the respective electrodes (shown later) and with
        the top end of the first electrode touching the bottom end of
        the second electrode. </p>
      <p>Gas takeoff line 65 connects the interior of hood 60 to filter
        70, from which gas collection line 75 connects to compressor 80
        on top of, and communicating with, storage tank 90. Tank outlet
        valve 89 has fuel supply line 91 connecting the tank through
        valve 92 to fuel line 93 of internal combustion engine assembly
        94. Connecting further fuel supply line 95 connects through
        valve 96 to fuel line 97 of torch 100 to which line 99 connects
        from oxygen tank 98. </p>
      <p>FIG. 2 shows fragmentarily, in perspective, block electrode
        assembly 30 on partition 21 of the reactor (as in FIG. 1 but
        larger). Central opening 35 in the compartment is as wide as the
        spacing between the narrow edges of respective wedge-shaped
        electrodes 31, 32. The rounded lower end of rod 51 is nearing
        the opening within which it will rest as the arc is struck
        across the electrodes and through it when power is applied
        across the electrodes at terminals 34, 36. Water is omitted as
        unnecessary to an understanding of this view, but it will be
        understood that an arc between the electrodes through the rod
        heats the water so greatly as to break the water down into
        constituent gases and also to produce gases containing carbon.
        The next two views will aid understanding of the ensuing
        procedure. </p>
      <p>FIG. 3 shows, in block form, a flow diagram of steps that take
        place in the practice of this invention. Sequential steps
        include Turn On High Current Power Supply, Start Arc Under
        Water, Feed Carbon Rods, Evolve Gases, Collect Gases, Filter
        Carbon Particles, Compress Gases, and Store Compressed Gases.
        The last mentioned step is performed upon an evolved, partly
        reacted, mixture of constituent and by-product gases, useful as
        a fuel gas. Cool And Filter Water is a cyclical accessory step
        useful in maintaining water conditions as desired, especially at
        the locus of gas evolution--from which the evolved gases bubble
        up through the intervening water and into the overlying hood, to
        be drawn off and stored for use. </p>
      <p>FIG. 4 shows, in similar block form, examples of subsequent
        usage of the gaseous mixture evolved and collected (as in FIG.
        3). Stored Compressed Gases go as a fuel gas to a Torch for
        Cutting or Heating, also supplied with oxygen, and/or to an
        Internal Combustion Engine, also supplied with Air. These
        exemplified uses may be augmented in kind or in number in
        accordance with demand and supply. </p>
      <p>How to practice this invention is readily apparent from FIGS. 1
        to 4 and the foregoing description. Underwater arcing occurs
        when an electrical potential (either A.C. or D.C.) such as used
        in steel welding is applied across the block electrodes, which
        preferably are composed essentially of graphite--provided that a
        conductive rod (preferably also carbon) substantially bridges
        the gap between them. </p>
      <p>The mixture of gases so evolved and collected according to the
        present invention contains (by volume) gaseous hydrogen in major
        amount, such as from about five to about seven tenths, and
        carbon monoxide in substantial minor amount, such as from about
        two to about three tenths. Also likely to be present as an
        end-product (here a by-product) is at most about a tenth to an
        eighth made up mainly of carbon dioxide and gaseous oxygen--the
        latter in an amount insufficient for the mixture of gases to be
        self-combustible (rarely more than several percent). Traces of
        methane and/or other organic gas may be present as well. </p>
      <p>Carbon in the resultant gaseous mixture comes mainly from the
        rod used to bridge the block electrodes. The carbon dioxide
        content is held down by substantial absence of hydrocarbons,
        oils, or other organic chemicals, such as otherwise might
        combine with the oxygen released by water decomposition in the
        reactor. Resulting gaseous oxygen may be attributed to the water
        decomposition and/or to having been dissolved in the water. </p>
      <p>A representative analysis of the fuel gas of this invention can
        be expected to show about five-eighths gaseous hydrogen, two
        eighths carbon monoxide, with the rest made up of the other
        mentioned gases. </p>
      <p>The resulting fuel gas burns well upon access to air or oxygen
        in effective amount, with substantially clear flame and no
        sooting. As noted, it can fuel a cutting or welding torch along
        with oxygen, or an internal combustion engine along with
        air--without need for an atomizing carburetor or injection
        nozzle. Such an engine may be of jet, piston, turbine, or other
        type, as to power a vehicle, a pump, or an electrical generator,
        for example. </p>
      <p>No unusual materials of construction are needed in apparatus of
        this invention. The reactor need be only a structurally sound
        tank, such as steel or other metal, and is preferably grounded.
        The hood to receive the evolved gases, and the magazine to hold
        and dispense the rods, are conveniently made of metal, plastic,
        or ceramic. The magazine may accommodate any convenient number
        of rods, conveniently loaded upright side-by-side on an inside
        surface slanting down to a exit directly above the desired
        electrode-bridging location so as to fed by gravity, although
        automatic feed may be adopted if preferred. </p>
      <p>The rods themselves may be common welding rods, composed mainly
        of particulate carbon held together by a conventional binder. As
        also noted, the electrode blocks are solid graphite, also
        generally available for use in welding and other
        high-temperature environments and/or high-pressure environments
        requiring chemical inertness. </p>
      <p>The water to be decomposed in the process of this invention is
        not subject to any unusual requirement, and most fresh water
        sources can be expected to prove satisfactory. The water should
        not contain petroleum products or other organic materials in
        appreciable concentration, as they might contaminate the
        resulting fuel gas with compounds not so clean burning--or
        otherwise result in a less desirable fuel gas. </p>
      <p>The toxicity of carbon monoxide is tolerated in preference to
        conversion of carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide in the
        reactor--with reduction in fuel capability--because concentrated
        fuel materials of whatever sort pose health and safety hazards.
        Caution is essential in handling and using any fuel, so it is
        expected to be exercised in the instance of this fuel gas as
        well. </p>
      <p>The combustion products of gaseous hydrogen and carbon monoxide
        are respectively simply water and carbon dioxide, so clean
        burning is an understandable characteristic of the resulting
        fuel gas, as is the preference for exclusion of organic
        materials generally. Other advantages include the fact that
        water is a relatively low-cost starting material. Similarly, the
        power required to decompose water is readily available at
        reasonable cost in at least most locations. </p>
      <p>Preferred embodiments and variants have been suggested for this
        invention. Other modifications may be made, as by adding,
        combining, deleting, or subdividing compositions, parts, or
        steps, while retaining all or some of the advantages and
        benefits of the present invention--which itself is defined in
        the following claims.<br>
