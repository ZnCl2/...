      <p><b>Abstract -- </b>Fuel gas production by underwater arcing
        bubbles up from the vicinity of the arc and is collected by an
        overlying hood and used or stored for use as a fuel, as in
        operation of a cutting or welding torch, or in operation of an
        internal-combustion engine. A reactor or production unit for
        such fuel gas contains a body of water, which may be open to the
        ambient atmosphere and be at ambient temperature. The arc is
        established in a spark gap between carbon electrodes and is
        facilitated by introduction of successive carbon rods end-on
        into the spark gap, as by dispensing them successively from a
        magazine. </p>

      <p>TECHNICAL FIELD </p>
      <p>This invention relates to production of gaseous fuel evolved as
        bubbles in underwater electrical arcing between carbon
        electrodes. </p>
      <p>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>Electrical arcing is known from U.S. patents to be conducive to
        hydrogen gas production, as via steam reforming at
        superatmospheric pressure and temperature, over a century ago by
        Eldridge et al. in U.S. Pat. No. 603,058 (1898). See also the
        contributions by other inventors cited in the examination of my
        U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,435,274 (1995); 5,692,459 (1997); 5,792,325
        (1998); and 5,826,548 (1998). Most, if not all, of those
        inventors were interested mainly in collecting hydrogen, so
        other gases were absent, dissolved, reacted, or otherwise
        removed. Yet hydrogen is far from the ideal fuel it was often
        imagined to be. </p>
      <p>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>A primary object of the present invention is to derive by
        underwater arcing a gaseous fuel easily and cleanly combustible
        with air. </p>
      <p>Another object of this invention is to produce from underwater
        arcing a fuel gas rich in easily and cleanly combustible
        components. </p>
      <p>A further object of the invention is to utilize such fuel gas,
        as in cutting or welding torches and in internal combustion
        engines. </p>
      <p>Yet another object is an production of such a gaseous fuel in a
        simple production unit operable at ambient temperature and
        pressure. </p>
      <p>A still further object is to achieve the aforementioned objects
        economically with such fuel--free of noxious combustion
        effluents. </p>
      <p>In general the objects of the present invention are attained by
        making/using gases evolved as bubbles in underwater carbon
        arcing. </p>
      <p>More particularly, the objects of this invention are attained
        by means of a plurality of underwater electrodes plus added
        carbon. </p>
      <p>Other objects of the present invention, together with means and
        methods for attaining the various objects, will become apparent
        from the following description and the accompanying diagrams of
        preferred embodiments presented here by way of example rather
        than limitation. </p>

      <p>DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>FIG. 1 shows in schematic elevation apparatus for evolving and
        collecting a mixture of gases as the fuel gas of this invention.
        At the left is welder 10 as an exemplified high-current power
        supply. Pair of electrical leads 24, 26 go to and through
        reactor wall 20 and connect at terminals 34, 36 across block
        electrode assembly 30 (detailed in FIG. 2) supported on
        horizontal partial partition 21. </p>
      <p>Reactor 20, the gas-production unit, contains a body of water
        (dashes) to a high level (triangle) covering the electrode
        assembly. Also submerged is water outlet 22, near the bottom, to
        water line 42 containing filter/pump 44 and leading to heat
        exchanger 40 hidden by louvers 42 and on to inlet 48 (near top)
        at the end of return line 48 from the heat exchanger. Carbon rod
        magazine 50 and laterally surrounding gas collection hood 60
        enter the reactor from the top and terminate under water, above
        block electrode assembly 30. First and second rods, 51 and 52,
        are aligned upright within the magazine, centered above the
        electrode assembly, with the bottom end of the first rod close
        to bridging the narrow edges of the respective electrodes (shown
        later) and with the top end of the first such rod touching the
        bottom end of the second such rod, to follow on as the first rod
        is consumed progressively at a prevailing temperature of several
        thousand degrees in the electrically conducting arc. </p>
      <p>Gas takeoff line 65 connects the interior of hood 60 to filter
        70, from which gas collection line 75 connects to compressor 80
        on top of, and communicating with, storage tank 90. Tank outlet
        valve 89 has fuel supply line 91 connecting the tank through
        valve 92 to fuel line 93 of internal combustion engine assembly
        94. Connecting further fuel supply line 95 connects through
        valve 96 to fuel line 97 of torch 100 to which line 99 connects
        from oxygen tank 98. </p>
      <p>FIG. 2 shows fragmentarily, in perspective, electrode assembly
        30 on reactor partition 21 (much as FIG. 1 but larger) defining
        a spark gap therebetween. Central opening 35 in the compartment
        is as wide as the spacing between the narrow edges of respective
        wedgeshaped electrodes 31, 32. The rounded lower end of rod 51
        is nearing the opening, within which it will rest as the arc is
        struck across the electrodes and through it when power is
        applied across the electrodes at terminals 34, 36. Water
        illustration is omitted as unnecessary to an understanding of
        this view, but it should be understood that an arc between the
        electrodes via the rod heats the water so greatly as to break
        the water down into constituent gases (and perhaps further),
        thus producing gaseous hydrogen, also gases comprising hydrogen
        and carbon, or carbon and oxygen, or all three. </p>
      <p>FIG. 3 shows, in block form, a flow diagram of steps that take
        place in the practice of this invention. Sequential steps
        include Turn On High Current Power Supply, Start Arc Under
        Water, Feed Carbon Rods, Evolve Gases, Collect Gases, Filter
        Carbon Particles, Compress Gases, and Store Compressed Gases.
        The last mentioned step is performed upon an evolved, partly
        reacted, mixture of constituent and by-product gases, useful as
        a fuel gas. Cool And Filter Water is a cyclical accessory step
        useful in maintaining water conditions as desired, especially at
        the locus of gas evolution--from which the evolved gases bubble
        up through the intervening water and into the overlying hood, to
        be drawn off and stored for use. </p>
      <p>FIG. 4 shows, in similar block form, examples of subsequent
        usage of the gaseous mixture evolved and collected (as in FIG.
        3). Stored Compressed Gases go as a fuel gas to a Torch for
        Cutting or Heating, also supplied with Oxygen, and/or to an
        Internal Combustion Engine, also supplied with Air. These
        exemplified uses may be augmented in kind or in number in
        accordance with demand and supply. </p>
      <p>How to practice this invention is readily apparent from FIGS. 1
        to 4 and the foregoing description. Underwater arcing occurs
        when an electrical potential (either A.C. or D.C.) such as used
        in steel welding is applied across the block electrodes,
        preferably composed essentially of graphite, and aided by a
        conductive rod (preferably similarly carbon) bridging the spark
        gap between the electrodes. The evolved gas(es) is(are)
        evidenced by bubbles forming in the vicinity and rising in the
        surrounding body of water, thus entering the hood. </p>
      <p>The mixture of gases so evolved and collected according to the
        present invention contains (by volume) gaseous hydrogen in major
        amount, and carbon monoxide in substantial minor amount. Also
        likely to be present as end-products (here by-products) are
        carbon dioxide and gaseous oxygen--insufficient to render the
        mixture of gases to be self-combustible (rarely more than
        several percent). Traces of simple organic gases may be present,
        as may complex aggregations (as yet unidentified) of the
        constituent carbon, hydrogen and/or oxygen. </p>
      <p>Carbon in the resultant gaseous mixture comes mainly from the
        rod used to bridge the block electrodes. Carbon dioxide content
        is limited by relative absence of hydrocarbons, oils, or other
        organic chemicals, such as otherwise might combine with the
        oxygen released by water decomposition in the reactor. Resulting
        gaseous oxygen may be attributed to the water decomposition
        and/or to having been dissolved in the water. Operation of an
        internal-combustion engine is substantially free of noxious
        effluents usually characteristic of fossil fuel combustion and
        will reduce any carbon deposits therein. An engine running on
        this fuel in a closed room lacks noxious fumes and related
        health hazards (except for eventual oxygen depletion). </p>
      <p>Analysis of this fuel gas can be expected to verify about three
        to five tenths hydrogen, two to three tenths carbon monoxide,
        less than one tenth organics, maybe up to a couple tenths of
        aggregations derived from C, and/or H, and/or O--not yet
        adequately identified. </p>
      <p>The resulting fuel gas burns well, upon access to air or oxygen
        in effective amount, with substantially clear flame and no
        sooting. As noted, with air or oxygen it can fuel a cutting or
        welding torch, and with air alone can operate an internal
        combustion engine without need for any atomizing carburetor or
        complex injection nozzle. Such an engine may be of jet, piston,
        turbine, or other type, useful in powering a vehicle, a pump, or
        an electrical generator, for example. </p>
      <p>No unusual materials of construction are needed in apparatus of
        this invention. The reactor need be only a structurally sound
        tank, such as steel or other metal, and is preferably grounded.
        The hood to receive the evolved gases, and the magazine to hold
        and dispense carbon rods, are conveniently made of metal,
        plastic, or ceramic. The magazine may accommodate several to a
        dozen or more rods, being conveniently loaded substantially
        upright such as side-by-side on a surface descending to an exit
        directly above a desired electrode-bridging spark gap--so as to
        be easily loaded, then fed by gravity. </p>
      <p>The rods themselves may be common welding rods, composed mainly
        or exclusively of particulate carbon pressed into continuous
        form. The electrode blocks are solid graphite, also generally
        available for high-temperature and/or high-pressure
        environments, although the operating environment of the present
        process is much less demanding. Chemical inertness and
        electrical conductivity are highly desirable, and the reactor or
        production unit may be operated open to ambient conditions or
        may be enclosed, similarly, and heated or pressurized </p>
      <p>An equidistantly spaced third electrode is preferred to enable
        three-phase A.C. operation of the reactor for maximum output. An
        electrical potential approximating a hundred volts is
        recommended. </p>
      <p>The water to be decomposed in the process of this invention is
        not subject to any unusual requirement, whereupon most fresh
        water sources, or brackish or sea water, even wastewater can be
        expected to prove satisfactory. Selected water should not
        contain petroleum products or other organic--especially
        fossil--materials in more than token concentration, as they
        might contaminate the resulting fuel gas with a plethora of
        component compositions less clean-burning, or otherwise might
        result in a fuel gas that is less desirable overall. Biomass
        materials are usually a similarly undesirable feedstock, and
        preferably are removed by coagulation, flotation, filtration,
        etc. </p>
      <p>The toxicity of carbon monoxide is tolerated in preference to
        conversion of carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide in the
        reactor--with reduction in fuel capability--because concentrated
        fuel materials of whatever sort pose health and safety hazards.
        Caution is essential in handling and using any fuel, so it is
        expected to be exercised in the instance of this fuel gas--which
        is much safer than gasoline. </p>
      <p>As combustion products of hydrogen and/or carbon monoxide are
        predominantly simply water and carbon dioxide, clean burning is
        an understandable characteristic of the resulting fuel gas, as
        is the preference for exclusion of organic materials generally.
        Further advantages include the fact that water is a relatively
        low-cost feed material, as is carbon (if less so). Also, little
        electric power is required because only low impedance exists
        across the spark gap during conduction for
        decomposing/vaporizing both carbon and water. </p>
      <p>The present invention is especially desirable in those regions
        devoid of fossil fuels, or that are subject to excessive
        pollution from long-time usage of low-grade and/or
        high-contaminant fuels, or where the inhabitants lack the
        purchasing capability to obtain fuel. </p>
      <p>Preferred embodiments and variants have been suggested for this
        invention. Other modifications may be made, as by adding,
        combining, deleting, or subdividing compositions, parts, or
        steps, while retaining at least some of the advantages and
        benefits of the present invention--which itself is defined in
        the following claims.<br>
