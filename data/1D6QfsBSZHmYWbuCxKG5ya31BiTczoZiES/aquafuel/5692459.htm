      <p>TECHNICAL FIELD </p>
      <p>This invention relates to motor vehicles powered by combustion
        engines and operable substantially pollution-free on given fuel
        gas. </p>
      <p>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>Fossil fuels, such as coal, petroleum (including diesel oil,
        kerosene, jet fuel, and gasoline), and even natural gas, are
        burned for many purposes. Their combustion effluents contain, in
        addition to the customary carbon dioxide and water, undesirable
        materials, such as hydrocarbon fragments and derivatives, often
        in particulate form, carbon monoxide, and gaseous oxides of
        nitrogen and/or of sulfur transformable to noxious droplet form
        (acid rain). </p>
      <p>Hydrogen, long considered prospectively an ideal fuel because
        convertible completely to water in air combustion, is
        unsatisfactory as fuel for internal-combustion engines because
        it heats the intake valves until pre-ignition flashback occurs,
        ahead of the combustion chamber--not only deleterious to the
        engine but also conducive to emission of harmful nitrogen oxides
        into the atmosphere. See, for example, HYDROGEN STORAGE AND
        UTILIZATION IN TRANSPORTATION VEHICLES--SUMMARY, published by
        the U.S. Department of Energy, Alternative Fuels Utilization
        Program, Office of Transportation Systems in 1988, including
        citation of numerous other pertinent references. </p>
      <p>Many large cities have become badly polluted by the emissions
        from combustion of fossil fuels. Significant contributors
        include motor vehicles, lawnmowers, heating systems,
        manufacturing plants, and electrical generating plants, despite
        many laws and safeguards for limiting harmful effluents. The
        increasing smog will become worse at an accelerating rate unless
        abatement is put into practice. My invention is the first and
        (so far) only solution to the problem. </p>
      <p>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>A primary object of the present invention is operation of motor
        vehicles without pollution of the environment. </p>
      <p>Another object of this invention is to fuel combustion in such
        a way that it is substantially free of harmful emissions. </p>
      <p>A further object of the invention is to enable substantially
        pollution-free operation of internal-combustion engines. </p>
      <p>Yet another object of the invention is to enable motor vehicles
        to provide electrical power useful in their operation. </p>
      <p>A still further object of the invention is to render production
        of electrical energy for use by motor vehicles more
        environmentally friendly than it customarily is nowadays. </p>
      <p>A still further object of this invention is to accomplish the
        foregoing objects more economically than possible with fossil
        fuels, preferably taking into account environmental as well as
        other costs. </p>
      <p>In general, the objects of this invention are attained using
        fuel gas combustible substantially completely to carbon dioxide
        and water vapor, whether in an internal-combustion engine or
        otherwise. </p>
      <p>More particularly, motor vehicles are fueled according to this
        invention and thereby enabled to combust the fuel pollution-free
        and to be driven either directly through engine-produced motive
        power or indirectly by electricity generated by engine-produced
        motive power. </p>
      <p>In addition, this invention enables vehicles with considerable
        fuel requirements to produce fuel gas on board--advantageous for
        sea transport vessels as well as for trans-continental trucks.
        The fuel gas is liquefiable for convenient storage and air,
        land, or sea use. </p>
      <p>The fuel gas input materials are inexpensive carbon and water.
        Also required is a source of electrical energy sufficient to
        strike an underwater arc, which is readily maintained with
        little energy input because of its negative temperature
        coefficient of resistance. Once struck, the arc is readily
        maintained, and requires much less energy input than is
        subsequently obtainable as output by combustion of the fuel gas
        evolved via the high-temperature (5.degree.-6000.degree. F.)
        arc. </p>
      <p>Other objects of the present invention, together with means and
        methods for attaining the various objects, will become apparent
        from the following description and the accompanying diagrams of
        preferred embodiments, presented by way of example rather than
        limitation. </p>

      <p>DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>FIG. 1 shows, in schematic side elevation, partly in section,
        an embodiment of apparatus 10 adapted to evolve, collect,
        compress, and liquefy fuel gas of this invention. It features,
        at the left, electrical meter 12 connected to an external source
        (not shown) of electrical power via pair of leads 11, and
        connected by pair of leads 13 to welder 14, with heavy-duty
        electrical output adjustable by setting of arm 15 on dial 16,
        and connected by pair of heavily insulated leads 17, 19 to
        respective electrodes 27, 24 in tank 20. The tank is filled with
        water (shaded) to level 28 near its top. </p>
      <p>FIG. 2 shows details of part of the apparatus in tank 20 of
        FIG. 1 on an enlarged scale, including especially lead 17
        connected to graphite block electrode 27, lying on insulating
        slab 27 on raised floor 26 of the tank, whereas lead 19 connects
        to the lower end of oblique magazine 24-partly sectioned away to
        show (shaded) contactor portion 29 of the magazine, fitting
        closely around carbon rod 25 to assure electrical contact just
        above its protruding lower end. Cylindrical hood 30, upright on
        support 31 upstanding from the bottom of tank 20, is open at its
        submerged bottom end in the water above the nearest approach of
        the magazine to the block electrode. </p>
      <p>FIG. 1 also shows, cylinder 21 (inert flushing gas) with valve
        22 connected by tubing 23 to the upper end of magazine 24, which
        is capable of holding at least several carbon rods and is
        covered by cap 25 except during loading of the rods. Fuel
        transport tube 32 connects the top of gas-collecting hood 30
        through in-line isolation valve 33 and compression pump 39 to
        three-way distribution valve 39, which may be closed, open to
        upper branch line 4, or open to lower branch line 41. The upper
        branch line leads from the distribution valve to coupling 5 of
        fuel gas storage container 6 having pressure valve 7 thereon.
        Successive containers may be connected to the line for filling,
        and be disconnected therefrom for storage when filled. </p>
      <p>Lower branch line 41 from distribution valve 39 leads to the
        top of condenser 40 inside insulating jacket 45, where it
        connects to the top end of helical condenser tube 43, whose
        bottom end connects via outlet tube 49 to (liquid fuel)
        container 60. The helical tube is surrounded by condenser jacket
        42, which has vent tube 41 at its upper end and is supplied at
        its lower end with coolant from tank 50 (valve not shown) via
        tube 51 and branch tube 52. Branch tube 53, when its valve 54 is
        open, feeds coolant around container 60 in insulated box 68,
        with vent 61 and cover 62, on balance base 69 with scale 65--for
        weight of the container and its contents. </p>
      <p>FIG. 3 shows internal-combustion engine apparatus 70, with
        cooling radiator at the left. Engine 75 is fed with fuel gas
        boiling off from container 60 via outlet tube 67 through valve
        72 and to the engine intake via tube 74. Air reaches the engine
        from the atmosphere via adjacent adapter or butterfly valve 73.
        Drive shaft 76 connects engine motive output to gearbox or
        electrical generator 77. </p>
      <p>It will be understood that motor vehicles, such as automobiles,
        locomotives, tractors, and trucks, may be operated by
        application of conventional motive output from a combustion
        engine to their driving wheels, or alternatively may be operated
        by application of motive output to electrical generating
        equipment whose electrical output operates motors mechanically
        connected to such vehicle drive wheels. </p>
      <p>Aircraft and watercraft may be propelled similarly, directly by
        motive output from a combustion engine or by equivalent
        electrical driving of propeller or screw means (drive wheel
        analogues). Not only may ships burn the fuel gas of this
        invention in the combustion chambers of steam boilers or in
        formerly diesel-fueled engines, but aircraft also may run on
        this fuel instead of jet fuel or gasoline. </p>
      <p>FIG. 4 shows, in block form, a flow diagram of steps that take
        place in the practice of this invention. The fuel generation
        steps predominate in the upper part of the view. The fuel
        conversion and power generation steps predominate in the lower
        part of the view. </p>
      <p>Sequential steps in the fuel generation part of this invention
        include (1) TURN ON HIGH CURRENT POWER SUPPLY, (2) START ARC
        UNDER WATER, (3) FEED CARBON RODS, (4) EVOLVE GASES, (5) COLLECT
        GASES, (6) FILTER OUT CARBON PARTICLES, (7) COMPRESS FUEL GASES,
        and (8) STORE COMPRESSED FUEL. The last two mentioned steps are
        performed upon the evolved fuel gas, presumably a mixture or
        other aggregation of gases. Accessory composite steps (9) COOL
        AND FILTER WATER maintain water conditions as desired,
        especially at the hot underwater arc locus of gas evolution-from
        which evolved gases bubble up through the intervening water,
        heating it, and into the overlying hood, to be collected and
        stored for fuel use as indicated. </p>
      <p>Sequential steps in the center of FIG. 4 include arrows and
        lines from the Store Compressed Fuel step downward to the lower
        part of the view, and a pair of symmetrically located steps,
        (16) COMBUST MINORITY OF FUEL (at left) and--at right--(11)
        COMBUST MAJORITY OF FUEL. Succeeding the latter step are the
        sequential steps of (12) DRIVE MAJOR GENERATOR, (13) GENERATE
        EXTERNAL 3.o slashed. AC. A final arrow on the right terminates
        at (14) EXTERNAL LOADS. To the left from the step (15) COMBUST
        MINORITY OF FUEL are the sequential steps of (16) DRIVE MINOR
        GENERATOR and (17) GENERATE INTERNAL AC/DC terminating at (18)
        INTERNAL LOADS. </p>
      <p>FIG. 5 shows, in schematic side elevation, a filling station
        (at right) providing fuel of this invention to truck 70 (at
        left). The truck has cab 74 and engine compartment 78 forward,
        and cargo compartment 77 aft, on flat bed 75 supported via
        springs on pair of front wheels 71 and two pairs of rear drive
        wheels 72 connected by suitable means (not shown) to engine 73,
        whose muffler and exhaust pipe 79 are upright behind the cab.
        Fuel tank 76 is slung underneath the bed below the cab with fuel
        line (hidden) to the engine. </p>
      <p>Filling station building 101 houses embodiment 100 of apparatus
        for evolving, collecting, and compressing fuel gas according to
        this invention, including electric welder 114, water tank 102,
        electrodes (not noted) circulating pump 103, and water-cooling
        heat-exchanger 104. Gas-collecting hood 106 is connected in turn
        to particulate (in-line) filter 107, compressor 108, and storage
        tank 109. Fuel delivery line 118 connects the stored fuel to
        metering pump 119, and fuel filling line 120 connects in turn to
        truck fuel compartment 76. </p>
      <p>No attempt is made in FIG. 5 or FIG. 6 to show connection of
        engine motive output to the drive wheels, as by conventional
        drive shaft, differential, and axle shaft, or instead--as noted
        below--by electrical connection, from an added generator run by
        the engine, to electric motors connected mechanically to the
        wheels to drive them. </p>
      <p>FIG. 6 shows semi-trailer 90 connected at its front end to
        tractor 80, by hitch 86 on flat bed 85 of the tractor, and
        supported at its rear end by a double pair of wheels 92. The
        tractor resembles the front end and undercarriage of the truck
        of the preceding view in having cab 84 and engine compartment 88
        forward on flat bed 85. The bed is supported via springs on pair
        of front wheels 81 and twin pairs of rear drive wheels 82
        connected by means (not shown here) to engine 83, with fuel
        compartment 86 slung underneath. The trailer, supported at its
        front end by the tractor, has lateral bulkhead 97 (broken line)
        dividing it into large rear cargo compartment 98 and small
        forward on-board fuel-manufacturing compartment 96, containing
        fuel evolving, collecting, compressing, and storage means of
        this invention, such as shown to some extent in the filling
        station, or in modified detail in FIG. 1. Fuel-manufacturing
        compartment 96, shown at about one-fifth of the trailer length,
        may be more compact. </p>
      <p>FIG. 7 shows electric drive arrangement 110, wherein motor 111
        connects by drive belt 115 to drive wheel 112, which otherwise
        would be driven by conventional mechanical connection from the
        engine. The motor is a FIG. 4 external load operable by FIG. 3
        generator 77. </p>
      <p>How to make, store, and use the fuel of the present invention
        is readily apparent from this description and accompanying
        diagrams. However, what happens in the electrical arc is not
        well understood, and need not be understood in order to practice
        this invention. To the extent that this specification suggests
        what occurs in or as a consequence of the arc, or interprets
        decomposition, recombination, or combustion processes, or
        suggests why the resulting fuel gas has or lacks certain
        characteristics or certain compositions, that text should be
        understood as being academic, speculative, or theoretical. In
        contrast, operational features of this invention, sufficient to
        enable its practice by persons of at least ordinary skill in the
        relevant arts, are specified here and are readily
        understandable. </p>
      <p>High-temperature arcing occurs--even under water--when adequate
        electrical potential (AC or preferably DC) is applied across a
        pair of electrodes, here preferably composed substantially of
        graphite. Presumably, pyrolysis ensues, and some surrounding
        water dissociates into its component hydrogen and oxygen; also
        some carbon vaporizes. Some of the carbon oxidizes to carbon
        monoxide, and some of the carbon and/or some of the carbon
        monoxide oxidizes to carbon dioxide. If the electrodes are less
        wetted than when immersed in excess water the predominant carbon
        oxide will be dioxide rather than monoxide. If the electrodes
        are non-carbonaceous, the essential carbon must be introduced
        into the arc in rod, particulate, or other suitable form.
        Presumably, combination of carbon with hydrogen is less likely
        than with oxygen, whereupon most (if not all) of the hydrogen
        dissociated from water is present in the form of molecular
        hydrogen. The gas has (at most) only a faint odor, suggesting
        minimal organic content, with perhaps trace(s) of ethylenic
        and/or acetylenic hydrocarbon(s). </p>
      <p>The water to be decomposed in the process of this invention is
        not subject to any unusual requirement. Most water sources prove
        satisfactory, including brackish or salt--as well as
        fresh--water, but water polluted with petroleum or the like
        should be avoided. </p>
      <p>The fuel gas of this invention appears to have leak-resistant
        capability because it diffuses through semi-permeable membranes
        more slowly than its presumed component compositions do.
        Comparative testing in balloons of elastomeric material often
        filled with air or perhaps helium reveal this remarkable
        property. Whereas a hydrogen-filled balloon will deflate by
        diffusion of the gas through its wall in a matter of several
        hours or so, and identical balloons filled with air or carbon
        oxides deflate likewise in several days or so, an identical
        balloon filled with the fuel gas of this invention will not
        deflate fully for at least about several weeks--namely, an order
        of magnitude (ten times) as long or as slow as air for example,
        or two orders of magnitude (a hundred times) as long or as slow
        as hydrogen. Indeed, balloons filled with fuel gas produced by
        this invention have not fully deflated in a half year--yet
        another order of magnitude as long (or as slow). This remarkable
        capability may even compensate to some extent for an
        incompletely seated valve. </p>
      <p>Chemical and physical analyses of this fuel gas have failed to
        account for its apparent leak-resistant property. Speculation
        about possible presence of gaseous polymers, fullerenes, etc.
        has ensued. As already indicated, structural explanations of
        properties are not essential to production and use of the fuel
        gas of this invention. </p>
      <p>The fuel gas so evolved and collected according to the present
        invention appears, from physical and chemical analyses, to
        comprise (by volume) gaseous hydrogen in major amount, as from
        about four to about seven eighths, carbon monoxide in
        predominant minor amount, as from about two to about four
        eighths, and lesser amounts of other gases, such as carbon
        dioxide, hydrocarbons (or other organics), nitrogen, or
        oxygen--the latter in concentration insufficient for
        self-combustion. A representative sample might be about
        five-tenths hydrogen, three-tenths carbon monoxide, and the rest
        other gases. </p>
      <p>This fuel gas burns evenly with substantially clear flame and
        no sooting upon adequate access to air (about a half dozen times
        the fuel volume). It can fuel an internal combustion engine
        without a carburetor or injection nozzle. Conversion to this
        gaseous fuel may be facilitated by use of a gas fuel adapter.
        Suitable adapters are available from Garretson Equipment Co.,
        Inc., Mt. Pleasant, Iowa. Also note Garretson U.S. Pat. Nos.

      <p>This fuel gas burns easily and evenly, with adequate access to
        air (about a half dozen times the fuel volume), and can operate
        an internal combustion engine without carburetor or injection
        nozzle. Conversion of gasoline vehicles to this gaseous fuel,
        however, may be facilitated by use of a gas fuel adapter.
        Suitable adapters are available from Garretson Equipment Co.,
        Inc., Mt. Pleasant, Iowa. Also note Garretson U.S. Pat. Nos.

      <p>The effluent from combustion of the fuel of this invention is
        substantially entirely carbon dioxide gas and water vapor, as
        shown by analyses of effluent from lawnmower and automobile
        engines fueled with it. Hydrocarbon fragments in any form are
        conspicuous by their absence, as are all particulates,
        presumably because of the facility of complete combustion of the
        simple components of the fuel gas. A possibility of hydrocarbon
        contamination exists from currently used petroleum-based
        lubricants, or from loosening of carbonized deposits of formerly
        used lubricants and fuels, especially in old engines. </p>
      <p>Oxides of nitrogen, common in combustion products of gases from
        fossil fuels or of hydrogen alone, are missing (or minimal)
        because there is no possible source other than air, and the
        carbon monoxide content effectively cools and evens out
        combustion in the engine so as to preclude their generation by
        intake valve overheating, flashback, or other hyperoxidative
        characteristic of hydrogen combustion. </p>
      <p>Carbon monoxide is not found in the effluent, notwithstanding
        its content in the fuel itself, because carbon monoxide oxidizes
        so readily to carbon dioxide. Carbon monoxide in automobile
        exhaust gases results from insufficient combustion of gasoline
        hydrocarbons. </p>
      <p>Indeed, an internal-combustion engine running on this fuel can
        be located in an occupied room without harming the occupants, as
        its operation normally reduces pre-existing concentration of
        ordinary pollutants in the ambient atmosphere (the combustion
        air source), so such engine operation cleans the air rather than
        contaminating it. The distinction between gasoline operation of
        an internal-combustion engine and its operation on the fuel gas
        of this invention has to be seen and smelled to be believed--and
        enjoyed. Effluent analysis by competent objective analysts has
        confirmed the merits of this fuel. </p>
      <p>No unusual materials of construction are needed in apparatus of
        this invention. The reactor need be only a structurally sound
        tank, such as steel or other metal, and is preferably grounded.
        The hood to receive the evolved gases may be separate from or
        combined with the tank. The magazine to hold and dispense carbon
        rods also may be made of metal, plastic, or ceramic. The
        magazine may accommodate any convenient number of rods,
        conveniently loaded at least partly upright, side-by-side on an
        inside surface slanting down to an exit directly above the
        desired electrode-bridging location, so as to be fed by gravity,
        although automatic feed may be adopted if preferred. </p>
      <p>Whereas solid graphite is preferred for block electrodes, the
        rods may be composed mainly or solely of particulate carbon,
        preferably without added binder. Both are also generally
        available for use in welding and other high-temperature
        environments and/or high-pressure environments requiring
        chemical inertness. </p>
      <p>Both water and carbon are also relatively low-cost inputs.
        Similarly, the power required to decompose water is readily
        available at reasonable cost in at least most locations. </p>
      <p>The electrical potential applied across the underwater arc is
        preferably DC (direct-current) rather than AC (alternating
        current). Conventional welding equipment operates from standard
        line-power AC (usually 3-phase) input, and yields a DC or AC
        output, as desired. For present purposes a DC output of at least
        several dozens of volts across the electrodes is preferred.
        External rectification of AC is readily accomplished, as in
        welding apparatus, for example. AC to DC conversion without
        moving parts and with an improved output may be accomplished
        according to Luce U.S. Pat. No. 4,870,558. </p>
      <p>If a conventional power source is objectionable because
        dependent upon fossil fuels, part of the electrical power output
        can be applied to maintain the arc, and a small part can even be
        stored, as in a battery or a large capacitor, to restart the arc
        at any time. The chemical energy available by burning the fuel
        is so much greater than the energy required to maintain the arc
        as to be economical. </p>
      <p>Preferred embodiments and variants have been suggested for this
        invention. Other modifications may be made, as by adding,
        combining, deleting, or subdividing compositions, parts, or
        steps, while retaining all or some of the advantages and
        benefits of the present invention--which itself is defined in
        the following claims.</p>
