    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">What if I told you there was a
      reliable, inexpensive, non-polluting gas created from water that
      could provide a safe and efficient replacement for fossil fuels?
      And what if I told you this technology was immediately available
      and, with little modification, could be used in the internal
      combustion engines we drive today? </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Admit it: You're skeptical, at best.
      If this were a viable alternative fuel source, you would have
      heard about it already. Right? </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">After nearly two decades, Largo
      inventor William H. Richardson is used to being doubted. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">"I've been called a magician and a
      crackpot," says Richardson, the research and development director
      for Definitive Energy LLC and the original patent owner of a
      seemingly simple process for turning water into fuel. "There is so
      much opposition to it." </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Richardson calls this alternative
      energy source Aqualene and claims that the gas created from
      separating water molecules is better for the environment than any
      biofuel and less costly than hydrogen fuel-cell technology. For
      the last 15 years, he has championed Aqualene to NASA, the U.S.
      government and corporations small and large -- with no success. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Now, a little dejected, Richardson
      looks to other uses for his patented gas, from powering a more
      effective cutting torch to purifying water in third world
      countries. Aqualene, he says, can even cook a mean steak. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The would-be fuel of the future isn't
      created in some top-secret lab protected by security codes and
      surveillance cameras, but in a small warehouse space off Starkey
      Road in Largo. Richardson, a machinist by trade, makes tools in
      this space to bring in his regular income, while he works with the
      other members of Definitive Energy LLC to market Aqualene
      (formerly called Aquafuel until another company purchased the
      rights to that name). With the understated zeal of Al Gore,
      Richardson laments the state of the environment and how
      unrenewable carbon sources -- in forms of coal, oil and natural
      gas -- are contributing to the problems of global warming and
      pollution. But with Aqualene, Richardson claims, the only
      byproducts are water and a small amount of carbon dioxide, which
      can be recycled by plant life. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">"The planet takes care of itself," he
      says. "It's when we get in the way and start to abuse areas that
      we have problems." </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Anxious to demonstrate, Richardson
      leads me to a glass bowl full of water sitting on a shop table and
      attaches two insulated clamps, connected by three 12-volt
      batteries, to a graphite rod. When he lowers the rod into the
      water, it produces a bright white light -- the "electric arc" --
      furiously sending bubbles to the surface. Richardson places a
      funnel over the bubbles and ignites the gas spewing out of the
      narrow end, producing a solid orange flame. That gas -- a
      combination of oxygen, hydrogen and carbon -- is Aqualene. He
      claims 100 volts can produce 1,000 cubic feet of Aqualene per
      hour. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Richardson reaches over for a balloon,
      fills it from a pressurized tank full of Aqualene and watches it
      float to the ceiling. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">"The gas will dissipate and fly out of
      the atmosphere," he says, filling another balloon and taking out a
      lighter. "And it's combustible." </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The explosion warms my face;
      Richardson burns the hair off his hand. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Richardson says Aqualene could replace
      other combustible gases like acetylene and propane, both of which
      are less effective and produce more pollution. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Richardson then directs my attention
      to a lawnmower engine mounted on a table with a tube connected to
      the tank of Aqualene. He pulls on the lawnmower cord and the
      engine starts. There's no smell of gasoline (or any other fuel)
      nor is there any kind of visible smoke or exhaust. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">"This engine is just like every other
      engine on the planet, except it runs on water," he says proudly.
      "They call it the engine that could." </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Later, Richardson shows me home videos
      of him driving a Ford Escort and Mustang that he says are running
      off Aqualene. Both cars appear to operate like any
      gasoline-powered car; in one clip, Richardson peels out in his
      parking lot with the Mustang, later claiming he's reached 110
      miles per hour in the modified roadster. The only design problem,
      he says, is that Aqualene's water byproduct could easily rust the
      tailpipe. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Sound crazy? </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">"So what, we're doing it," Richardson
      snaps back. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Still, not everyone is quick to accept
      his claims. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Dr. Mike Zaworotko, chair of the
      chemistry department at the University of South Florida-Tampa, is
      quick to point out he does not know William Richardson and has
      never heard of Aqualene. He admits he's no expert in the
      electrolysis of water. But still, he's skeptical -- Zaworotko says
      USF's chemistry department hears similar claims by various groups
      every few years. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">"They portray [water-based fuels] as
      the answer [to environmental woes]," he says. "It's an attractive
      proposition to a lot of people. It's easy to sell 'We're above
      everybody else and everyone is against us.'" </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Zaworotko says the basic idea behind
      Aqualene has been around for generations, but not much is known on
      how effective it is as a fuel source. He cautions that other
      inventors who have made similar claims forget a basic rule of
      physics: "It is physically impossible to get more energy than you
      put in." </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">With Aqualene, the electricity used to
      separate the hydrogen and oxygen molecules -- itself created
      through fossil fuels -- may use more energy than is recoverable
      from the produced gas. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Richardson has heard this all before.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">"Fundamentally, [many chemists and
      engineers] don't understand it," he says. "We're manufacturing a
      product that is above the normal chemistry findings." </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">And, perhaps to his detriment, he
      quotes a line from Star Trek: "It's chemistry, Jim, but not as you
      know it." </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The opposition to Aqualene as a fuel
      source has led Richardson to other ventures and eight other
      patents. His latest is Aquaclean, a device using the heating
      properties of Aqualene to turn cloudy, polluted water (or salt
      water) into pure distilled water. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">"Presently we're working with some
      missionary groups out of Africa," he shares. "They're trying to
      drill holes for clean water, but it's expensive and it's hard to
      prove you're going to get clean water. But most villages have a
      source of water -- it's just not usually fit [to drink]. If they
      run it through this unit, it would be cheaper than drilling a hole
      in the ground and they would have an accurate supply of clean,
      drinkable water." </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The prototype of his latest invention
      -- made from all manner of tubes, steel pots and metal piping --
      looks like something out of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.
      He claims 10 gallons can be produced an hour; the scalability,
      unlimited. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">"This is probably going to be a good
      market in the future," he says. "Some day, in this country, we're
      going to need a cleaner source of water." </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">For the moment, Richardson is more
      interested in pursuing the water-cleaning apparatus than in trying
      to convince skeptics of the feasibility of using his alternative
      fuel to power vehicles (although his colleagues at Definitive
      Energy LLC have not given up). He remains doubtful a small startup
      company can beat the government and oil money. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">"That's why I'm going after water," he
      says. "You don't have to put up with all that political nonsense."
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">With that, he pulls out a letter from
      ExxonMobil and chuckles. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">"We have no interest in ..." the
      letter begins. </p>

    </center>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Toups Technology Licensing (TTL)
      announced the scientific documentation of AquaFuel Technology:
      AquaFuel is a reliable, inexpensive, non-polluting gas which is a
      viable, immediately available replacement for fossil-based fuels.
      TTL licenses technologies primarily in the energy, environment and
      natural resource market segments. The Company also makes
      acquisitions of existing companies which compliment TTL's
      technology mix. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Since November 1, 1997, the Company
      has been engaged in scientific documentation relating to the
      characteristics of the AquaFuel Technology. <br>
      The AquaFuel process results in the production of a gas originally
      identified by patent owner <b>William H. Richardson, Jr</b>. The
      AquaFuel process encompasses an electric discharge on carbon rods
      within ordinary, sea or other forms of water. The discharge
      decomposes the carbon rods, separates the water and creates a
      plasma of mostly ionised hydrogen, oxygen and carbon atoms at
      about 5,000 degrees C. The atoms combine in various forms, cool
      down in the water surrounding the discharge and bubble to the
      surface where they are collected and stored. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The AquaFuel Technology is covered by
      <b>US Patent 5,435,274</b> ("Electrical Power Generation Without
      Harmful Emissions"); <b>US Patent 5,692,459</b> ("Pollution-Free
      Vehicle Operation"); <b>US Patent 5,792,325</b> ("Electric Arc
      Material Processing System"); <b>US Patent 5,826,548</b> ("Power
      Generation without Harmful Emissions"); and other US Patents
      Pending. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Toups Technology has secured the
      exclusive world- wide rights to all applications covered by the
      above listed patents. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">AquaFuel is inherently safe to produce
      and store because all oxygen resulting from the separation of the
      water is combined with the carbon and it is then released only
      during combustion. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">AquaFuel is easy to produce anywhere
      desired because of the simplicity of the equipment. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">AquaFuel can be produced in a large
      column with consumer-oriented equipment, while unlimited volume
      can be produced on industrial plants. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">All bacteriological activities ceased
      to exist in 3 gallons of sewage following 1 minute of exposure to
      the AquaFuel apparatus. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The AquaFuel process provides a new
      viable form of recycling sewage either by municipalities or by
      individual households. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">An engine running on AquaFuel would
      have to operate for over 210,000 hours to equal the amount of CO
      produced in 1 hour while being fuelled by gasoline. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">It should be also noted that AquaFuel
      could be used as a fuel without any catalytic converter and the
      emission exhausts would still meet EPA requirements. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The minimal value of the energy
      content of AquaFuel produced from tap water is 380 BTU/cf. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The energy content of AquaFuel from
      tap water has resulted to be higher than that of hydrogen (300
      BTU/cf). </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The minimal value of the energy
      content of BioMass AquaFuel (6.8 lb brown sugar dissolved in 1
      gallon water) is 532 BTU/cf. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">AquaFuel emerges as a combustible fuel
      with better ecological features of any other fuel. In fact, all
      conventional fossil fuels need large amounts of oxygen to burn and
      release no appreciable oxygen in the combustion exhausts, thus
      being the primary, undisputed cause of the atmospheric oxygen
      depletion. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Oxygen consumption for BioAquaFuel is
      5 %, which is less than one-third of the oxygen consumption by
      natural gas. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">AquaFuel has the best exhaust
      characteristics second to no other available fuel (including
      hydrogen), as well as the smallest oxygen consumption (for
      instance, natural gas uses 213 % more Oxygen than AquaFuel). As a
      result, AquaFuel is one of the most environmental friendly fuels
      in all respects, including pollutants, atmospheric oxygen
      depletion, health problems and other factors. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Preliminary tests performed using a
      1987 Ford Tempo which had been converted to research on natural
      gas and included a number of measurements via on-board sensors
      were taken with the following findings: </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">1. The outstanding combustion exhausts
      indicated negative readings, that is, recycling of pollutants in
      the air. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">2. A number of octanes of AquaFuel
      resulted to be higher than 160, the upper limit of the measuring
      equipment. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">3. A reduction of the temperature of
      the exhaust pipes from 1,340 degrees F for natural gas to 1,160
      degrees F for AquaFuel. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The results of the tests establish
      that AquaFuel can be successfully used to power combustible
      engines used in cars and trucks. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The cost of the electricity needed to
      produce AquaFuel has been measured at $ 0.02/cf under the use of 3
      welders in series absorbing 39 kW with a discharge at 60V DC and
      AquaFuel production of 151cfph. Said cost is expected to decrease
      considerably via the use of power units specifically built for the
      process. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">When AquaFuel results from recycling
      waste-water, the cost of AquaFuel is $ 0.00. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">When compared with acetylene as a
      cutting gas, the tests have established that AquaFuel is a
      preferable fuel for metal cutting even when produced from tap
      water, with better characteristics expected for AquaFuel with
      higher energy content. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Initial measures of the primary
      AquaFuel characteristics have yielded the following numerical
      values: </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Energy content of at least 380 BTU/cf;
      <br>
      Molecular weight of 15.24 lbm/mole, <br>
      Specific gas constant of 101.4 ft-lbf/lbm- deg; <br>
      Correction factor for flow meter of 0.942. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The production of AquaFuel increases
      nonlinearly with the increase of the discharge voltage and it is
      at least 20 % more efficient with an AC discharge operating at 20
      Hertz as compared to a DC discharge with the same electric energy.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The new chemical structure of AquaFuel
      implies the emergence of new technologies such as new methods for
      gas liquefaction, new types of fuel cells, enhanced thermochemical
      reactions and new methods of producing magnetically polarised
      gases. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>1</b>. AquaFuel is cost
      competitive, has dramatically less pollutant in the combustion
      exhaust, and can be more easily and safely produced and stored
      anywhere desired than any other combustible gas, even neglecting
      its free production as a by product of sewage recycling; </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>2</b>. In view of theabove
      characteristics, AquaFuel is one of the best, if not the best fuel
      available at this writing for automotive and other uses on a
      world-wide basis, with particular reference to consumer, but also
      for municipal industrial and military applications. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>3</b>. The AquaFuel process
      provides a basically novel method for recycling liquid waste which
      produces AquaFuel as a usable gas, water usable for irrigation and
      solids usable for fertilisation; </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>4</b>. AquaFuel is an excellent gas
      for the production of electricity, particularly in the free form
      obtained from the recycling of liquid waste from cities and
      municipalities; </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>5</b>. Systematic scientific
      experimentations and theoretical studies have identified a number
      of anomalies in AquaFuel which are applicable to all other gases,
      thus permitting a new gas technology with implications and
      applications to the entire gas industry and consequentially vast,
      additional economic horizons. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Commercialization ~</b> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The Company is now engaged in the
      construction of the following products for sale: </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The consumer home power generator. A
      unit approximately the size of a large air conditioning unit
      designed to be plugged into a 120V outlet overnight so as to
      produce AquaFuel. The liquid medium used is the daily household
      sewage which collects in the apparatus during the course of the
      day. The AquaFuel is captured and stored in a tank. Each morning,
      the homeowner disengages conventional power source by switching
      main circuit breakers and engages the AquaFuel powered generator
      to provide all daytime electricity needs. The homeowner discharges
      the recycled water into the municipalities' wastewater system and
      the process begins again. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The overnight automotive power
      generator. Available for conventional cars retrofit for AquaFuel
      in a manner similar to that used to retrofit cars to natural gas.
      A unit approximately the size of a large air conditioning unit
      designed to be plugged into a 120V outlet overnight so as to
      produce AquaFuel. The liquid medium used is the daily household
      sewage which collects in the apparatus during the course of the
      day. The AquaFuel is captured and stored in a tank. Each morning,
      the consumer refills the automotive tanks with the AquaFuel
      produced overnight providing enough fuel for typical daily usage.
      The automobile owner discharges the recycled water into the
      municipalities' wastewater system and the process begins again. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">AquaFuel Desk-Top Production Unit. A
      unit approximately the size of a large briefcase which encompasses
      the production and storage of AquaFuel. The unit is designed to
      demonstrate the concept and practical production methods of
      AquaFuel for sale to high school and college laboratories as well
      as interested persons world-wide. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Recycling Demonstrator. A unit
      identical in shape to a six-foot-long, twelve-inch-diameter pipe
      into which polluted water is introduced at the point of entry,
      passes through the AquaFuel process (electric arc across carbon
      rods in water) and cleaned water leaves at a point of debarkation.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">"A stated goal of TTL has been to use
      our technologies for the improvement of our planet and the
      protection of our natural resources," said TTL CEO Leon Toups. "We
      are proud to be at the forefront of delivering the fuel for the
      next century: AquaFuel. The implications of our science that the
      AquaFuel process can clean polluted waterways while producing a
      reliable, affordable, pollution-free fuel for both consumer and
      industrial uses goes a long way toward helping us achieve our
      stated goal. In our commercialisation phase we now intend to
      engineer the application that can be scaled up for practical use."

    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">In the race for buckyballs, Nobel
      prize winning scientists discovered a third form of carbon - C60 -
      created by striking an electric arc in a gap between carbon
      electrodes within a vacuum. This new carbon molecule has fantastic
      properties and holds tremendous promise for creating great new
      carbon-based materials and products. Leading scientists and
      authorities initially scoffed at the discovery and dismissed it as
      "junk". Beyond buckyballs, a new carbon electrode arc technology
      is now being used UNDERWATER to produce ultra-clean-burning,
      low-cost alternative synthesis gas, or syngas called AquaFuel.
      This simple method of producing a hydrogen/carbon/oxygen gas holds
      great promise for energy and chemical production. AquaFuel is
      being produced in demonstration units and is now undergoing tests
      in engines and research labs. The electric power industry can now
      produce their own fuel on demand and on sight. EPA's tough new
      rules to fight smog, electric utility deregulation, and even the
      new world’s push to cut atmospheric carbon dioxide means a period
      of change unparalleled in all of the history of power generation.
      Survival will require being aware and taking action to form new
      technology partnerships. AquaFuel technology can become the
      perfect solution to the upcoming fuel burning dilemma. This could
      be the ultimate weapon in the EPA's war on SO2 and NOX and even
      the new PM 2.5 particulate standard rules and future proposals.
      The petroleum industry can now increase the value of the petroleum
      coke product resulting from crude oil processing. Coke may now be
      economically combined with hydrogen and oxygen from water with
      this new efficient electro/chemical process. Coke and water can
      become the perfect pollution solution. Other carbon sources
      including the growing mountains of old tires have been recycled
      and the carbon reclaimed and used for this clean fuel production
      process. Even the carbon from biomass is being converted to fuel
      with this technology. This process is similar to MIT's work on the
      plasmatron (See Plasma Reformer-Fuel Cell Systems For
      Decentralized Power Applications International Journal of Hydrogen
      Energy -January 1997) where various hydrocarbons are subjected to
      an electric arc and reformed into H and CO. EPRI has chosen a
      demonstration 2MW molten carbonate fuel cell (MCFC) unit as most
      suitable for urban needs. Because of the high operating
      temperature, hydrogen and carbon monoxide can be used as fuels for
      the MCFC. Instead of reforming complex hydrocarbon chains however,
      the AquaFuel process obtains hydrogen and oxygen from water and
      consumes the graphite electrodes. To make AquaFuel - a low
      voltage/high amperage ac or dc electric arc tunnels through water
      between the tips of carbon electrodes. The 5,000 to 7,000 oF heat
      from the arc dissociates nearby water molecules into hydrogen and
      oxygen atoms. Carbon atoms break loose from the electrodes and
      form bonds in this high energy plasma soup. The resulting
      hydrogen/carbon/oxygen molecules cool and bubble up to the surface
      in the surrounding water. AquaFuel burns in conventional engines
      so cleanly that internal combustion engine exhaust gas emission is
      actually cleaner than any fossil fuel, as confirmed by Briggs
      &amp; Stratton, one of the nations leading dynamometer emission
      test labs. Nontoxic carbon dioxide and water vapor are the exhaust
      products from AquaFuel and air combustion. Hydrocarbons, nitrogen
      oxides, and carbon monoxide emissions are negligible even without
      any pollution control equipment of any type. Automobile engine oil
      stays clean and lasts long - reducing the need for frequent oil
      changing and cutting waste oil disposal problems. AquaFuel
      combustion creates lower exhaust gas and engine oil temperatures -
      helping to preserve oil integrity while the system runs cooler
      than burning gasoline in the same engine producing nearly the same
      power. Hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen are the dominant atomic
      components in AquaFuel. While pure hydrogen should be looked to as
      the ultimate fuel of the future, many technical hurdles need to be
      overcome before hydrogen can be useful as a general purpose fuel.
      Hydrogen does not burn well in conventional internal combustion
      engines because of high combustion temperatures which lead to a
      host of problems including the creation of nitrogen oxides -
      proven pollutants. Most commercial hydrogen used today is found
      with or made from fossil fuels such as natural gas. Hydrogen is
      very expensive to produce by other methods and it is difficult to
      store sufficient heat energy power in view of the very low energy
      density of even highly compressed hydrogen gas. Today, vehicles
      equipped to run on natural gas can run on compressed AquaFuel.
      While natural gas is among the cleanest burning vehicle fuels, it
      still is an air polluting fuel and can't be manufactured locally
      on-site at refueling stations. With AquaFuel - cars may some day
      be able to simply fill-up with non-flammable water and carbon,
      with no danger of spills, fire and explosions. AquaFuel may
      eventually be produced on-board and only when needed to power the
      engine. Ships would need only to stock-up on carbon, since water
      is readily available. Vulnerability from stored fuel explosions
      would be eliminated. AquaFuel could be marketed for use in all
      engines, needing only the addition ofsimple intake adapters such
      as found on fleet vehicles converted to run on natural gas or
      propane. AquaFuel can supply the market requirement for fueling
      thermal electric power generation, internal combustion engines,
      furnaces, heaters, stoves, and desalinization systems. Pollution
      control equipment can be stripped from existing fossil fueled
      engine and boiler systems. The potential market for AquaFuel
      includes supplementing natural gas, propane, and most all fuels
      derived from oil and coal. The market was identified by observing
      the ever increasing need for a pollution free alternative to
      today's poisonous fuel combustion byproducts. It was determined
      that a non-polluting fuel would have to be cheap and easy to make
      with low-tech equipment and the raw materials would need to be
      readily available, abundant, and recyclable. Also, the fuel would
      need to be compatible and adaptable to existing fuel consuming
      equipment. Fossil fuels emit tremendous amounts of carbon dioxide
      - but they also emit huge quantities of deadly poisons as well.
      Non-toxic carbon dioxide is the only gas produced from burning
      AquaFuel. Poisonous carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, sulfur
      dioxide, and other poisons are not produced when AquaFuel is
      burned with air. No pollution control equipment of any type is
      needed to achieve pollution-free emissions. Global warming fears
      from carbon dioxide could be cut with further research on AquaFuel
      using an internal combustion steam engine. Research may unlock the
      vast potential of both creating and then burning fuel underwater
      to produce heat and power with no atmospheric pollution. AquaFuel
      is basically a technology that uses carbon to free-up hydrogen and
      oxygen in an underwater process. Both creating fuel and burning
      fuel in the same water bath yields high efficiency and chemical
      control. Heated water can be converted into work through steam
      power. Water can dissolve carbon dioxide gas which can be
      precipitated out in the form of marketable product solid
      carbonates - just as the oceans capture and process atmospheric
      CO2. Contact inventor and patent-holder Bill Richardson for more
      information about project development and joint ventures. </p>

    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Abstract</b> --- In this paper we
      initiate studies of the emerging new forms of energy by using as a
      representative example the new combustible gas called AquaFuel,
      discovered and patented by William H. Richardson, Jr., whose
      rights are now owned by Toups Technology Licensing, Inc. (TTL), of
      Largo, Florida. In essence, AquaFuel is a new energy converter
      capable of transforming Carbon and water into a new combustible
      gas via an electric discharge. We show that AquaFuel can be
      produced easily, safely and rapidly in large amounts, and exhibits
      greatly reduced emission pollutants as compared to fossil fuels of
      current use. Despite its simplicity, the chemical and physical
      characteristics of AquaFuel are largely unknown at this writing.
      We then review nine basic experimental measurements which are
      necessary for a scientific appraisal of AquaFuel. We outline the
      limitations of quantum mechanics and chemistry for the treatment
      of it new forms of energy, namely, energies which by definition
      should be beyond said theories. We finally point out the
      availability of broader theories specifically constructed for the
      study of new energies and point out available applications. </p>

      conductive carbon rod provided endwise to the gap. The electrodes
      are rotated by mechanical means, intermittently or continuously.
      Carbon and water are thereby converted into fuel gas, evolving
      from the arc, and comprising hydrogen as the major constituent and
      carbon monoxide as predominant minor constituent. Both the fuel
      and its combustion products are substantially free from
      contaminants found customarily in petroleum-based fuels and their
      combustion products. Surplus heat enables water from any source to
      be rendered potable. </p>

    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Abstract</b> --- Method of
      generating electrical power without emission of harmful substances
      from combustion of a water-derived fuel gas mixture. An underwater
      carbon arc operated in the absence of hydrocarbons results in a
      mixture of gases, being non-self-combustible but combustible as a
      fuel gas in the presence of air, and comprising gaseous hydrogen
      in major amount and carbon oxides in minor amount, mainly carbon
      monoxide. The fuel gas is adapted, along with air, to run an
      internal combustion engine driving an electrical generator and so
      to provide useful electrical power without the harmful emissions
      usual in combustion of fossil fuels. </p>
