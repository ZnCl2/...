      <p>TECHNICAL FIELD </p>
      <p>This invention relates to an electropyrolytically produced
        non-fossil fuel, free of harmful particulate and gaseous
        effluents, and superior to hydrogen in heat output and lower
        combustion temperature. </p>
      <p>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>Internal-combustion engines commonly provide motive power for
        operating electrical generators, motor vehicles, and many other
        uses. Most such engines are bad polluters because they operate
        on fossil fuels, which contain a wide variety of components
        incapable of being fully combusted together within their brief
        residence in an engine. </p>
      <p>Combustion effluents of fossil fuels, such as coal, petroleum
        (including diesel oil, kerosene, jet fuel, and gasoline), and
        even natural gas, contain--in addition to customary carbon
        dioxide and water--undesirable hydrocarbon fragments and
        derivatives, often in particulate form, carbon monoxide, and
        gaseous oxides of nitrogen and/or of sulfur transformable to
        noxious droplet form (acid rain). </p>
      <p>Hydrogen was long-considered an ideal fuel because convertible
        completely to water via air combustion. See century-old Eldridge
        U.S. Pat. No. 603,058 for Electrical Retort wherein an electric
        arc flashed water to steam, then pyrolyzed it and carbon
        electrodes in a high-pressure reaction vessel, in order to
        recover hydrogen. </p>
      <p>Yet hydrogen is unsatisfactory as an internal-combustion engine
        fuel, because the high temperature and the rapidity of its
        combustion foster pre-ignition or flashback, which is greatly
        harmful to engine operation and structure. Also flashback is
        conducive to an increase of harmful nitrogen oxides (aptly:
        "NOx") in the atmosphere. </p>
      <p>An instructive reference is HYDROGEN STORAGE AND UTILIZATION IN
        TRANSPORTATION VEHICLES--SUMMARY, United States Department of
        Energy, Alternative Fuels Utilization Program, Office of
        Transportation Systems (1988). Despite the intervening decade of
        research and development, no vehicle running on hydrogen as its
        main or sole fuel is yet commercial, notwithstanding much
        experimentation on fuel cell technology, which is fundamentally
        electrolytic and slow-generating. </p>
      <p>Other commercial fuels and their uses, such as acetylene
        burning in a cutting or welding torch, have similar drawbacks.
        Acetylene also requires a higher concentration of oxygen than is
        present in air to enable the desired high temperature and
        facility of operation. </p>
      <p>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>A primary object of the present invention is to provide from
        simple readily available materials a non-self-combustible gas
        mixture effectively combustible with air without producing
        noxious effluents. </p>
      <p>Another object of this invention is to run internal combustion
        engines on such fuel gas, as to operate vehicles, as by a
        mechanical drive or by electricity generated by motor-generators
        so driven. </p>
      <p>A further object of the invention is to operate cutting and
        welding torches on such fuel gas, as for cutting and welding of
        metals. </p>
      <p>Yet another object is to provide a fuel adapted to burn cooler
        than hydrogen and to provide more heat energy output than
        hydrogen. </p>
      <p>A still further object is to achieve the aforementioned objects
        in economical fashion, even including related environmental
        costs. </p>
      <p>In general the objects of the present invention are attained by
        high-temperature underwater carbon arcing, preferably at or near
        the ambient temperature and pressure, whereby a
        non-self-combustible, cleanly combustible gaseous fuel is
        provided safely and efficiently. </p>
      <p>More particularly, the objects of this invention are embodied
        in a fuel gas rich in readily combustible gaseous hydrogen and
        carbon monoxide, and containing hitherto unidentified heavier
        constituents conducive to the desirable combustion
        characteristics of this fuel. </p>
      <p>Other objects of the present invention, together with means and
        methods for attaining the various objects, will become apparent
        from the following description and the accompanying diagrams of
        preferred embodiments presented here by way of example rather
        than limitation. </p>
      <p>To the extent that the description includes commentary
        bordering perhaps more on theoretical than practical aspects of
        the invention, readers will understand that such commentary is
        interpretive, rather than definitive, and so may be superfluous
        to practical understanding of how to practice the invention and
        to utilize it to good advantage. </p>

      <p>DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>FIG. 1 shows in schematic elevation apparatus for evolving and
        collecting a mixture of gases as the fuel gas of this invention.
        At the left is welder 10 as an exemplified high-current power
        supply. Pair of electrical leads 24, 26 go to and through the
        sidewall of reactor 20 and connect at terminals 34, 36 flanking
        block electrode assembly 30 (detailed in FIG. 2) supported on
        horizontal partition 21, located at a level intermediate between
        reactor top and bottom. </p>
      <p>Reactor 20 contains water (dashes) to a high level (inverted
        unshaded triangle) covering not only the electrode assembly but
        outlet 22 near the bottom to pipeline 42 containing filter/pump
        44 and leading to heat exchanger 40 mostly hidden by louvers 43
        and on to the near end of return line 48, which extends from the
        heat exchanger back to the reactor. Rod magazine 50 and
        concentric gas collection hood 60 extend downward to enter the
        reactor from above and terminate under water above block
        electrode assembly 30. First and second rods 51 and 52, aligned
        upright within the magazine, are centered above the electrode
        assembly, with the bottom end of the first rod bridging the
        spaced edges of the respective electrodes (shown later) and with
        the bottom end of the second rod abutting top end of the first
        rod. </p>
      <p>Gas takeoff line 65 connects the interior of hood 60, above the
        water line, to filter 70, from which gas collection line 75
        connects to compressor 80 on top of, and communicating with,
        storage tank 90. Tank outlet valve 89 has fuel product supply
        line 91 connecting the tank through valves 92 and 102 to
        respective fuel lines 93 and 103 to respective internal
        combustion engine assemblies 94 and 104. Shaft 109 from engine
        94 connects to electrical generator means 110, from which a
        first set of local leads 95 connect via junction 96 as a
        secondary electrical source to welder 10, and a further set of
        leads 98 connects from that junction to reactor water
        recirculator motor 44 and via junction 99 to motor 77 for
        compressor 80 located on top of fuel product storage tank 90. A
        set of leads 100 goes from motor-generator 100 driven via shaft
        107 from engine 104 to (block form) Output Electrical AC Load.
        Not shown in FIG. 1 is a further fuel supply line to a welding
        or cutting torch indicated in block form in the next view. </p>
      <p>FIG. 2 shows, in perspective and on an enlarged scale,
        electrode assembly 30 located on top of partition 21 (cut away
        along its visible edges) in the FIG. 1 reactor (otherwise not
        shown here). The partition has central opening 35 between the
        narrow spaced apart edges of respective wedge-shaped electrodes
        31, 32. The lower end of carbon rod 51 (visible where magazine
        50 is cut away) is nearing the opening, within which it will
        rest as the arc is struck across the electrodes and through the
        rod whenever power is applied across the electrodes at terminals
        34, 36 on respective electrical leads 24, 26. </p>
      <p>Mention of water is omitted as unnecessary to an understanding
        of this view, but in brief it will be understood that an
        electric arc is struck between already submerged electrodes--and
        part of the rod. The arc heats everything so greatly as to break
        the water down into its (gaseous) constituents, hydrogen and
        oxygen, and also to vaporize carbon from the rod and the
        electrodes, containing carbon. Possible other decomposition is
        considered further below but is unnecessary to understand of any
        of the drawing views. The next view will consider the order in
        which various operating procedural steps occur. </p>
      <p>FIG. 3 shows, in block form, a flow diagram of steps that take
        place in the practice of this invention. Sequential steps along
        the top row include Turn On High Current Power Supply, Start Arc
        Under Water, Feed Carbon Rods, Evolve Gases, Collect Gases, and
        Filter Out Carbon Particles, followed by (in second row)
        Compress Fuel Gases, and then Store Compressed Gases. Spaced
        apart in the second row is an accessory step, Cool And Filter
        Water, performed intermittently or continuously, as may be
        selected, to water conditions as desired, especially at the
        underwater locus of gas evolution--from which the evolved gases
        bubble up through the intervening water and into the overlying
        hood, to be drawn off and stored for use. </p>
      <p>From the second row in FIG. 3, the next step is Combust
        Majority of Fuel, followed (in third row) by Drive Major
        Generator followed by Generate External 3 Phase AC, and then
        External Load, which might be anything from a bank of lights or
        electric tools to an electric car, for example. That series of
        steps to external uses is paralleled by a similar series of
        internal steps: Combust Minority of Fuel, Drive Minor Generator,
        Generate Internal AC/DC, followed by Internal Loads. Also
        connected to Combust Majority of Fuel is the alternative or even
        concurrent end use, Cutting/Welding Torch, which is
        self-explanatory. </p>
      <p>How to practice this invention is readily apparent from FIGS. 1
        to 3 and the foregoing description. Reference numerals, having
        been applied hereinabove, are omitted here to aid the
        descriptive flow. </p>
      <p>No unusual materials of construction are needed in apparatus of
        this invention. The reactor need be only a structurally sound
        tank, such as steel or other metal, and is preferably grounded.
        The hood to receive the evolved gases may be separate from or
        combined with the tank. The magazine to hold and dispense carbon
        rods also may be made of metal, plastic, or ceramic. The
        magazine may accommodate any convenient number of rods,
        preferably loaded at least partly upright, end-to-end or
        side-by-side and aligned so as to feed down to an exit directly
        above the desired electrode-bridging location, so as to be fed
        by gravity, although automatic feed may be adopted if preferred.
      </p>
      <p>Underwater arcing occurs when a sufficient electrical potential
        (either A.C. or D.C.) of at least a few dozen volts such as used
        in welding is applied across the block electrodes, preferably
        graphite, provided with a bridging conductive rod (also carbon)
        therebetween. Pyrolysis ensues, and some of the highly heated
        water dissociates, as into its component hydrogen and oxygen;
        also much carbon vaporizes. </p>
      <p>Gas bubbles evolve within the water and, being confined only
        thereby, rise in the water because of their buoyancy and collect
        above the water under the hood. The hood's contents are
        retrieved substantially continuously and then are compressed
        into the holding tank, as already indicated, for subsequent use
        as may be desired </p>
      <p>The water in the reactor tends to get progressively hotter but
        is kept relatively cool, preferably from ambient temperature to
        at most about 140.degree. F. (60.degree. C.) by heat-exchange in
        the temperature-control system, enabling the generation of steam
        for whatever use and the condensation of potable water from the
        steam, whether formed from brackish, polluted, or even sea
        water. Safety is enhanced by working also at ambient pressure,
        assured by having the water surface open to the atmosphere
        instead of confined in a high-pressure reactor (as in Eldridge),
        although other favorable operating conditions may exist. </p>
      <p>Both the conductive rod and the electrodes are consumed bit by
        bit by the electric arc, as is the water, whose level is
        maintained above the arc by added water or by recirculation of
        steam condensate. The rods are consumed relatively rapidly and
        are fed in succession from the magazine above the reactor. The
        electrodes, being massive by comparison, last much longer but
        eventually have to be replaced. It is unnecessary to include
        additional compositions in either the electrodes or the rods,
        whose purity favors desirably pure effluent. </p>
      <p>This fuel gas burns easily and evenly, with adequate access to
        air (about a half dozen times the fuel volume), and can operate
        an internal combustion engine without carburetor or injection
        nozzle. Conversion of gasoline vehicles to this gaseous fuel,
        however, may be facilitated by use of a gas fuel adapter.
        Suitable adapters are available from Garretson Equipment Co.,
        Inc., Mt. Pleasant, Iowa. Also note Garretson U.S. Pat. Nos.
        3,974,851; 4,375,798; 4,829,957. </p>
      <p>The effluent from combustion of the fuel of this invention is
        substantially entirely carbon dioxide gas and water vapor, as
        shown by analyses of effluent from lawnmower and automobile
        engines fueled with it. Hydrocarbon fragments in any form are
        conspicuous by their absence, as are all particulates,
        presumably because of the facility of complete combustion of the
        very pure components of the fuel gas. A slight possibility of
        hydrocarbon contamination may result from the currently used
        petroleum-based lubricants, or from freeing carbonized deposits
        of formerly used lubricants and fuels, as in old engines. </p>
      <p>Indeed, an internal-combustion engine running on this fuel can
        be located in an occupied room without harming the occupants, as
        its operation normally reduces pre-existing concentration of the
        ordinary pollutants in the ambient atmosphere (the combustion
        air source), so such engine operation cleans the air rather than
        contaminating it. Of course, continued operation would convert
        oxygen progressively into carbon dioxide, which--though
        harmless--will not support human life. </p>
      <p>The distinction between the effluent of an internal-combustion
        engine on the fuel gas of this invention and the noxious fumes
        from its conventional operation on gasoline has to be seen--and
        smelled--to be believed and enjoyed. The pre-combustion odor of
        the fuel of this invention is not readily identifiable (sweet
        onion?) and is so slight as to evidence minimal, if any, organic
        content. It is fresh air by comparison with gasoline, much less
        a gasoline engine exhaust. </p>
      <p>Effluent analyses by competent objective analysts have
        confirmed the environmental merits of this fuel. Carbon monoxide
        is completely absent from the effluent, as are unburned
        particulates, whether of carbon or hydrocarbons. Oxides of
        nitrogen, common in combustion products of gases from fossil
        fuels or hydrogen alone, are minimal. </p>
      <p>The fuel of this invention has practical operational advantages
        over hydrogen. For example, the open-air combustion temperature
        of hydrogen at 655.degree. C. is substantially higher than the
        619.degree. C. of the fuel of this invention under like
        conditions. Engines also run cooler on it than on hydrogen,
        thereby reducing Nox production. Yet where a higher operating
        temperature is desirable, as in cutting cold-rolled steel, the
        fuel of this invention showed 1462.degree. C. vs. 1446.degree.
        C. for both hydrogen and acetylene. The available heat content
        of this fuel has been confirmed as 1243 (BTU/cu.ft.) at a
        density of 0.0562 (lb./cu.ft) vs. 300 at a density of 0.005 for
        hydrogen, and 1500 at a density of 0.0678 for acetylene. </p>
      <p>The fuel gas of this invention is slower overall than its
        identified component aggregated constituent compositions to
        escape through a semi-permeable membrane. Comparative testing in
        balloons made of elastomeric material, such as are filled with
        air or perhaps helium for entertainment, confirmed this
        remarkable property. A hydrogen-filled balloon fully deflates
        (equalizes inside-to-outside pressure differential) by diffusion
        of hydrogen gas molecules outward through such balloon wall in a
        matter of several hours. A balloon will soar up and away when
        filled with this fuel but will not lift off the next day after
        being filled. </p>
      <p>Identical balloons pressurized (to the same extent) with air,
        acetylene, carbon oxide (monoxide and/or dioxide) or mixtures
        thereof deflate likewise in several days. In contrast, identical
        balloons pressurized to the same extent with the fuel gas of
        this invention deflated only about halfway in a couple weeks,
        and retained inside-to-outside pressure differential for several
        months or longer. These experiments may have to be done to be
        believed, but they have been done repeatedly, with like outcomes
        each time. </p>
      <p>In other words, the time for diffusion of the fuel gas of this
        invention through such a common semi-permeable membrane is at
        least about an order of magnitude (ten times) as long as the
        corresponding time for the other mentioned gases (except
        hydrogen) and about two to three orders of magnitude (a hundred
        to a thousand times) as long as hydrogen. The diffusion rates
        vary inversely to the times, of course. Observable difficulty in
        passage through (and depositing in) small lines of analytic and
        other apparatus has tended to corroborate presence of something
        larger than expected in this remarkable fuel. </p>
      <p>Early physical-chemical analyses of the fuel of this invention
        failed to account for its apparent leak-resistant property.
        Thus, speculation about possible presence of gaseous polymers,
        fullerenes, etc. has ensued. Early spectrographic analyses did
        not consider any weight greater than about fifty to be
        significant enough to report. However, one did so, and reported
        many higher significant weights, which were dismissed, such as
        being from "noise" or contamination. However, two more recent
        spectroscopic checks by other experts, have confirmed
        substantial readings at low, medium, and high portions of the
        range from 100 to 200, at low and medium to high figures in the
        range from 200 to 300, and at low to medium figures in the range
        from 300 to 400--all expressly stated as conforming to no known
        substance. </p>
      <p>A world-renowned physicist has personally observed/supervised
        the last two such analyses and is convinced that the fuel
        contains as yet unidentified materials, electromagnetically
        bonded, as distinct from chemical bonding, whereupon it seems
        reasonable to call slow-diffusing portion(s) of the fuel
        "magnecules"--emphasizing their magnetic character over their
        size or "magnacules"--by analogy with "molecules" although their
        true nature remains quite mysterious. Such magnecules may be
        undergoing continuing changes in composition. </p>
      <p>To guard against contamination of gas samples for analysis,
        only distilled water was used, and the electrodes and rods were
        confirmed as extremely closely to 100% pure carbon. In practice,
        it does not appear that contamination of the water carries over
        to the resulting fuel. Moreover, the water is effectively
        distilled in the process. Of course, contamination with
        hydrocarbons should be avoided, as they might be gasified and be
        incompletely combusted, and pollute the air. </p>
      <p>The conventional portions of the prior spectrographic analyses
        may have led to an overestimate of the concentrations of
        identified gases, especially hydrogen as the major gaseous
        component, and carbon monoxide as the most prominent of the
        minor gaseous components. At present their concentrations appear
        to be closer to one another than believed before, as well as
        substantially reduced to allow for the high-weight magnecules.
        Accordingly, a revised estimate places the hydrogen content from
        about three-eighths to about a half, and the carbon monoxide
        content from about one-fourth to about three-eighths. </p>
      <p>The operation of the described apparatus at ambient pressure
        and temperature is preferred for reasons of safety and now also
        because of its possible contribution to the uniqueness of the
        fuel produced. Higher pressure and/or temperature might produce
        more, or even less, beneficial effects. The present molecular
        and/or magnecular content produce(s) such fine performance as to
        discourage any hasty changes. </p>
      <p>The precise molecular and/or magnecular distribution of the
        fuel may even be less important than its limitation to carbon,
        hydrogen, and oxygen--and their ready and complete
        air-combustion to only water and carbon dioxide. Any
        contribution of magnecules or other as yet unidentified
        aggregations of matter to the rapidity, smoothness, completeness
        of that conversion is a bonus to those persons who receive the
        advantages and benefits of this invention in its actual
        practice.<br>
