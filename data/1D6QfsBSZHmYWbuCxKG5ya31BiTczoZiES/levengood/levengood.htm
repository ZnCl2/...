      <b> </b><br>
      A simple method is presented for selecting individual seeds for
      growth and vigour prior to germination. The selection is based on
      the measurement of an electric current originating during the
      initial stage of seed imbibition. After selecting, seeds may be
      returned to the quiescent state without affecting viability.
      Results of both laboratory germination and field experiments
      demonstrate that high germination rates, more extensive growth,
      higher yields, and fewer defective plants are associated with
      small currents. Seeds of low viability and high currents may be
      removed to upgrade the germination and vigour. Results are
      presented from several varieties of Phaseolus vulgaris and from
      three other plant species. Experiments are discussed which
      indicate that seeds graded by current levels possess markedly
      different respiration rates.<br>

      </b><b>Abstract </b><br>
      <br>
      A method and apparatus for treating seeds with self-organized
      avalanches of electrons between electrodes (11, 12) as a cathode
      and an anode with seeds (13) between the anode and cathode or on
      the anode. Apparatus circuit (200) in a box (20) provides
      simultaneous DC and AC between the electrodes which creates the
      avalanche of electrons which project into the seeds. The seeds
      must be stored before planting. The seeds so treated have enhanced
      growth characteristics.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>(1) Field of the Invention</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for
      treating seeds, thereby reproducibly enhancing rate and uniformity
      of seed germination, early growth, root growth, maturity, and
      yield in food crops and other plants. These results are achieved
      by exposing seeds or growing plants to uniform,
      spontaneously-organized pulses of ion-electron avalanches. One
      important aspect is allowing a period of several weeks storage
      before planting thereby allowing internal, biochemical changes to
      take place at the cellular level within the seed. The present
      invention also relates to a quality-control method and apparatus
      for selecting optimal treatment parameters with the avalanches of
      ions and electrons for each variety of seed.<br>
      <br>
      <b>(2) Description of Related Art</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Almost since the discovery of the commercial use of electricity,
      experimenters have tried to electrically influence plant growth.
      Various prior art experimenters have claimed positive results from
      exposing growing plants to electrical stimulation in situ. A
      wiring network over a field of growing crops is not cost-effective
      or practical on a commercial scale, and such techniques have not
      been adopted by farmers.<br>
      <br>
      Some prior art experimenters have attempted to avoid the
      prohibitive cost of wiring a field by applying electromagnetic
      treatments to seeds before planting. Despite reports of increased
      growth and, in some cases, increased yield, these results have
      proven difficult to repeat and have not achieved commercial use.
      Parry (U.S. Pat. <b>No. 2,308,204</b> (1943)) describes the use
      of an oscillating DC voltage to treat seeds to increase
      germination of the seeds. There is no indication of improved
      plants. Jonas (<b>U.S. Pat. No. 2,712,713 </b>(1955)) and others
      exposed seeds to high frequency oscillating fields between 30 MHz
      and microwave range, claiming faster and more uniform germination.
      Jonas stated that the work of others along similar lines have been
      impossible to repeat and confirm. The patent describes only
      increased germination of the seeds. Amburn (<b>U.S. Pat. Nos.
        3,675,367</b> (1972) and <b>3,765,125</b> (1975)) exposed seeds
      to magnetic fields, claiming increased germination rate as an
      effect. Because of unreliability and non-reproducibility, none of
      these methods have achieved widespread commercial acceptance.<br>
      <br>
      Levengood (U.S. Pat. No.<b> 3,822,505 </b>(1974)) describes an
      apparatus for genetically altering plant cells using combined
      electrical and magnetic fields. The electrical field is static.
      There was alteration in the growth of seeds, but the method was
      not repetitively effective from batch to batch of seeds. Another
      patent to Levengood (U.S. Pat. No.<b> 3,852,914</b> (1974))
      describes a method for testing seeds for viability, by measuring
      pregermination tissue conductivity.<br>
      <br>
      Schiller et al (U.S. Pat. No.<b> 4,633,611</b> (1987)) describe
      treating seeds to disinfect them with low energy electrons using
      an electron gun. The radiation dosages are quite high and the
      acceleration voltages are between 25 and 75 kV. The use of high
      energy ionizing radiation can cause damage to chromosomes and
      resultant genetic change which poses complications for use in open
      fields. There is no indication that the growth of the plant is
      enhanced on a reproducible basis. Yoshida (<b>U.S. Pat. No.
        4,758,318</b> (1988)) describes using a pulsating direct current
      to prevent mold. The voltages were 300 to 20,000 V DC which were
      pulsed. This method is not practical on a large scale and the
      results were variable. Liboff et al (<b>U.S. Pat. No. 5,077,934</b>
      (1992)) describe the use of magnetic fields with plants in the
      soil. This method is not practical.<br>
      <br>
      Levengood (<b>U.S. Pat. No. 5,288,626</b> (1994)) describes
      genetically transferring DNA between plants using a constant DC
      voltage. This is also described in Bioelectrochemistry and
      Bioenergetics (1991). These are techniques for producing
      genetically altered plants.<br>
      <br>
      Other patents of general interest are Saruwatari (<b>U.S. Pat. No.
        4,188,751</b> (1980)) relating to magnetic treatment; Weinberqer
      (<b>U.S. Pat. No. 3,703,051</b> (1972)) relating to ultrasound; <b>U.S.







        Pat. No. 3,940,885</b> (1976) relating to microwaves.<br>
      <br>
      One system which used an A.C. ripple in a D.C. current to produce
      pulses is Tellefson (<b>U.S. Pat. No. 5,117,579</b> (1992)).
      Pulses of ions were produced from wire brush emitters to flood
      growing plants in a field. The method is not used with seeds.<br>
      <br>
      There is clearly a need for a reproducible and reliable method for
      treating seeds to enhance their growth characteristics. The prior
      art methods have not met this need since no such method is used
      commercially.<br>
      <br>
      <b>OBJECTS</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide an
      improved, reproducible method and apparatus for enhancing the
      growth characteristics of seeds. It is further an object of the
      present invention to provide such a method which is simple,
      reliable and economical to perform. Further still it is an object
      of the present invention to provide a method and apparatus for
      detecting whether or not the treated seeds have been effectively
      improved in their growth characteristics by the method and
      apparatus for enhancing growth characteristics Further still, it
      is an object of the present invention to provide a method and
      apparatus which allows monitoring during treatment of the
      effectiveness of the apparatus for performing the treatment. These
      and other objects will become increasingly apparent by reference
      to the following specification and the drawings.<br>

      </b><b>FIGS. 2A, 2B and 2C are graphs showing growth differences
        in tomatoes, pepper and carrot using a DC voltage for five
        minutes in the apparatus of FIG. 1A with seeds stored for 35 or
        36 days. Germination data was taken at the 12-day growth stage
        and represents hypocotyl extension (seedlings placed under grow
        lights at 4-day development). The data was compared with two
        control sets in each test series. FIG. 2A shows tomato seeds
        tested 35 days after exposure. FIG. 2B shows pepper seeds tested
        35 days after exposure. FIG. 2C shows carrot seeds tested 36
        days after exposure. As can be seen, similar curve shapes appear
        in the 5-minute exposure data. In every case the maximum peak is
        at the 5-kV level, with a secondary peak at 20-KV.</b><b><br>

        shows redox ratios of MIR-treated carrots to be lower than that
        of untreated controls, when measured after the plants develop to
        the mature autotrophic phase. The redox potential is determined
        from exudate from the seeds.</b><b><br>

      </b><b>DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b>The present invention relates to a method for treating a seed
      to enhance growth characteristics of the seed which comprises:
      providing the seed between a pair of spread apart electrodes as an
      anode and a cathode having a gap between them and with seed on or
      adjacent to the anode; applying a direct current (DC) voltage to
      the anode and the cathode using a power supply with an output
      voltage with an impressed alternating current AC ripple on the
      output voltage so as to produce self-organized, or pulsed
      avalanches of electrons moving from the cathode towards and into
      the seed between the anode and cathode or on the anode for a
      period of time which enhances the growth characteristics of the
      seed; and storing the seed for a period of time before planting
      sufficient to allow the seed to provide the seed with the enhanced
      growth characteristics.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention also relates to a seed produced by providing
      a space between an anode with the seed and the cathode, exposing
      the seed to pulsed avalanches of electrons produced by applying a
      DC voltage, with an AC ripple impressed upon the DC voltage, to
      spaced apart electrodes using a power supply with an impressed AC
      ripple in the output voltage to produce self-organized pulsed
      avalanches of ion-electrons which move towards and into the seed,
      and then storing the seed before planting.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention also relates to a plant produced from a seed
      produced by exposing the seed to pulsed avalanches of electrons
      produced by providing spaced apart electrodes which are an anode
      and a cathode with the seed between the anode and cathode or on
      the anode, applying a DC voltage with impressed AC ripple to the
      spaced apart electrodes to produce self-organized avalanches of
      electrons which move towards the anode and into the seed before
      planting.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention also relates to an apparatus for detecting
      the presence of pulsed avalanches of electrons in an apparatus for
      treatment of a seed which comprises: a solenoid coil with multiple
      turns which is adapted to be positioned adjacent to a pair of
      spaced apart electrodes including an anode supporting the seed;
      and detection means for detecting an induced current in the coil.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention relates to an apparatus for treating a seed
      to enhance the growth characteristics of the seed which comprises:
      a pair of spaced apart electrodes as an anode and as a cathode
      having a gap between them wherein the seed is to be supported on
      or adjacent to the anode; voltage generating means for
      simultaneously supplying a direct current (DC) voltage to the
      anode and the cathode using a power supply with an output voltage
      with an impressed alternating current AC ripple as the output
      voltage so as to produce organized, pulsed avalanches of electrons
      moving from the cathode towards and into the seed on the anode for
      a period of time which enhances the growth characteristics of the
      seed; and coil means with multiple turns mounted adjacent to the
      spaced apart electrodes which detects pulsed avalanches of
      electrons; and recording means for recording the pulsed avalanches
      of electrons as detected by the coil means.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention relates to a method for significantly
      improving the rate and uniformity of germination and early growth,
      as well as increased yield, in plants, particularly commercial
      crops, by a cost-effective treatment of the seeds using electron
      avalanches in a manner that can be reliably duplicated, and lends
      itself well to commercial exploitation. The method provides an
      apparatus for exposing seeds to organized avalanches of electrons
      from a flat electrode.<br>
      <br>
      The seeds 13 are placed directly on top of a horizontal, flat
      aluminum (or other metal) plate or electrode 11 which is an anode
      spaced from an electrode 12 which is a cathode so that the
      electrode 11 is the bottom most of the two parallel electrodes 11
      and 12. Alternatively, the seeds can be placed on a non-conducting
      screen 22 (FIG. 5) elevating them above the anode electrode 11.
      For all results listed here, the elelectrodes 11 and 12 used were
      round and 30 cm in diameter. Other shapes and sizes of electrodes
      can be used, though this may change the effective voltage levels.
      The electrodes 11 and 12 are supported by legs 14 and 14A made of
      a dielectric material. The bottom electrode 11 can take a variety
      of forms, such as a metal conveyor belt (not shown).<br>
      <br>
      A high-voltage DC power supply 20 providing positive current is
      connected to the bottom electrode (anode) 11, while the top
      electrode 12 (cathode) is grounded. Improved results are obtained
      if the DC power supply contains an organized 60 or 220 Hertz
      ripple in the DC. Other than such an AC trace and its resultant
      ripple, there is no other oscillation of the DC current. This
      distinguishes the apparatus from prior art systems which use a
      voltage oscillator, usually in the megahertz range or higher.<br>
      <br>
      Due to conductivity of the air between the electrodes 11 and 12,
      organized avalanches of electrons travel from the negative
      electrode 12 (cathode) to the positive electrode 11 (anode). These
      electron avalanches register as pulses on the monitoring equipment
      described hereinafter. When a "clean" signal DC power supply is
      used, both the frequency and amplitudes of the ion-electron
      avalanches are lower and more irregular. When a power supply with
      AC ripple is used, the avalanches form in regular self-organized,
      discrete pulses. These avalanche pulses commonly occur in the 0.1
      to 30 Hz range between the electrodes 11 and 12 and are a product
      of voltage gradient and conductivity of the air between the
      electrodes 11 and 12, not of an artificial oscillator. The term
      "self-organized" means that there is a discharge between the
      electrodes 11 and 12 dependent upon the voltage and the
      environmental conditions between the electrodes 11 and 12.<br>
      <br>
      The best results have been obtained when the electrodes 11 and 12
      are supported on dielectric legs 14 on a plastic-topped table 16
      and the bottom electrode 11 is grounded to the tabletop by a
      feedback loop 15 of a conductive metal. When the feedback loop 15
      is added, the same electrode system produces pulses of very
      similar frequency to those obtained without the loop, but of
      significantly increased amplitude. The reason for this is that the
      table top 16 appears to function as a feed-back loop type of
      capacitor.<br>
      <br>
      It has been found that an avalanche inducing voltage improving the
      seeds of some plant varieties was ineffective or actually harmful
      to seeds of other varieties. Likewise, the duration of the seed's
      exposure to the electron avalanches is important and variable. The
      diagnostic process to select the best times and voltages is also
      important. Finally, the waiting period before planting, and
      considerations of moisture in the air and seed temperature are
      important. The present method works well on seeds dried to normal
      levels for commercial storage and at temperatures above 40 DEG C.
      Monitoring apparatus, described later, can be used to adjust for
      altered air conductivity due to changes in relative humidity.<br>
      <br>
      The method of the present invention is referred to as Molecular
      Impulse Response, or MIR. A specific type of impulse from an
      electron produces a molecular response in the seed which
      ultimately results in significantly-improved seed performance,
      when it is applied in the following manner, including but not
      limited to:<br>
      <br>
      A.) Electrodes and Power Supply: Using a spacing between
      electrodes 11 and 12 (preferably 8 cm although other spacings,
      preferably between about 1 and 20 cm, can be used but will alter
      the effective voltages) and inducing a voltage gradient between
      the electrodes of about 2 kV or more (other voltages can be used
      up to, but below, the electrical breakdown voltage in air corona
      discharge) results in the production of organized electron
      avalanches which take the form of sharp, regular electrical
      conductivity pulses of relatively uniform amplitude in the air
      between the electrodes 11 and 12 (as traced on a chart recorder
      system 21 as shown in FIG. 1A) Such spontaneously organized
      electron avalanches have been described in the scientific
      literature, most notably by Nasser, as examples of a low density,
      low energy plasma in air at ambient pressure. (Source: E. Nasser,
      "Fundamentals of Gaseous Ionization and Plasma Electronics",
      Wiley-Interscience, New York, pages 209 to 217 (1971)).<br>
      <br>
      The frequency of the avalanche pulses rises spontaneously with
      increasing voltage (see FIG. 1B). This is different from the
      oscillating electric field employed by the prior art in which the
      frequency is fixed artificially and remained the same unless human
      intervention changed it. This difference is at the heart of the
      present invention because it is not oscillation of the electric
      field which produces the desired results but these spontaneous,
      organized avalanches of ion-electrons produced between the
      electrodes 11 and 12 in air which elicit the Molecular Impulse
      Response.<br>
      <br>
      Use of a pure DC power supply, with no AC ripple, results in
      electron avalanches with significantly less pulsing and
      regularity. Exposure of seeds to these pulses results in a lower
      seed performance than those exposed to a DC power supply with an
      AC ripple. Furthermore, results are difficult to consistently
      reproduce when an AC ripple is absent. Thus it is not merely
      exposure to an electric field which produces the beneficial
      results claimed here, nor is it exposure to any type of electron
      avalanches. The seeds must be exposed to the sharp, regular,
      uniform or organized electron avalanches as shown in FIG. 1B for
      best results.<br>
      <br>
      B.) Diagnostic Procedure: Different voltages (generally between
      2-20 kV) and different time exposures (from seconds to minutes)
      produce the best results with different varieties of seed. The
      optimal parameters are selected for each seed by exposing them at
      a range of voltages for a range of times, and comparing the
      results by germination and/or growth and/or yield tests, as well
      as by redox measurements.<br>
      <br>
      A redox diagnostic procedure allows the achievement of significant
      improvements in a wide variety of seed/plant types. This
      diagnostic procedure is necessary because a variety of seed which
      is positively effected at a high (20 kV) or low (5 kV) voltage may
      be effected negatively by a medium (15 kV) voltage. Conversely,
      seeds which do well at a low voltage may do poorly at a high
      voltage and vice versa.<br>
      <br>
      It has been found that the seeds should be stored at 40 DEG F. to
      80 DEG F. If the temperature is too low then no result is
      achieved.<br>
      <br>
      It will be appreciated that the seeds can be positioned on a
      non-conductive screen 22, such as fiberglass, between the
      electrodes 11 and 12 as shown in FIG. 5. Preferably the electrodes
      11 and 12 are round with rounded edges. The electrode preferably
      has a 8 to 9 cm gap and a diameter of about 30.5 cm. The seeds are
      placed on the electrode so as not to be touching significantly.<br>
      <br>

      Frequently, laboratory germination voltages were tried in
      increments of 5, i.e. 5, 10,. 15 kilovolts, while field tests were
      in increments of four kilovolts, thus producing non-exact matches.
      Results of a range of treatment durations have been averaged here
      for each voltage for simplicity.<br>
      <br>
      A key element of the present invention is a waiting period during
      which treated seeds are not germinated for a minimum of several
      weeks after exposure. Germination of exposed seeds before this
      waiting period is completed can result in no improvement in the
      seeds or even negative effects. Consistent, reproducible,
      improvements are not found with seeds planted soon after exposure.
      Improved effects in treated seeds have been seen as long as 18
      months after treatment. There is not as yet any known upper limit
      to the waiting period. While the minimum waiting period varies
      from one seed variety to another, a minimum of 30 days has been
      found to be effective. The seeds of FIGS. 2A to 2C were stored for
      35, 35 and 36 days respectively.<br>
      <br>
      The redox ratio is a measure of temporal variations in respiration
      as measured by changes in oxidation/reduction activity in
      seedlings grown from treated seeds. Increased phase amplitudes of
      redox cycles, indicative of increased rates of respiration and
      free radical activity, have been consistently measured in 10-12
      day seedings grown from MIR-treated seeds (FIGS. 3A and 3B). Many
      studies have suggested that alterations in redox ratios are linked
      with growth responses in biological organisms. (Levengood,
      "Bioelectrochemistry And Bloenergetics, 19 461-476 (1988); also
      Allen and Balin, "Free Radical Biology and Medicine" Vol. 6, pp.
      631-661 (1989); A. Sakamoto et al., FEBS Letters, Vol. 358 pp. 62
      (1995)). Whether or not this is in fact the mechanism of the
      present invention, alterations in redox ratios have been seen to
      be linked with improved growth performance in MIR-treated seeds,
      including eventual increases in final yield. In the green seedling
      autotrophic stage, redox levels of seedlings grown from
      MIR-treated seeds are lower than in untreated seedings as shown in
      FIG. 4, consistent with the hypothesis of higher levels of
      anti-oxidants present which deactivate free radicals and thereby
      lower redox ratio levels.<br>
      <br>
      Measurements were made according to the procedure set forth in
      Levengood, Bioelectrochemistry And Bioenergetics, 19 461-476
      (1988). Detection of the above-mentioned free radical alterations
      can be used as a means of quality control for MIR operations. This
      monitoring or quality control can serve as a rapid check that the
      desired effect is being achieved in the treated seeds, without
      resorting to time-consuming growing of the seeds. This redox ratio
      analysis makes commercial scale operations reliable and
      dependable.<br>
      <br>
      From several hours to several days after treatment, MIR seedlings
      display raised redox ratios, indicating a burst of free radicals
      within the cells formed by the impact of the ion-electron
      avalanches. Seeds experience activation of cellular anti-oxidant
      defenses and consequently have lowered redox ratios. In dried
      seeds this process moves slowly, as do all metabolic processes in
      quiescent seeds. Seeds which have been treated at an effective
      voltage and for an effective time will, during storage, experience
      a redox level shift as cellular anti-oxidant defenses, such as
      Superoxide Dismutase (SOD) and others, deactivate the free
      radicals. In maize, for example, cells have been known to produce
      more SOD than needed to disable the free radicals present. Gail L.
      Matters and John G. Scandalios, "Effect of the free
      radical-generating herbicide paraquat on the expression of the
      superoxide dismutase (Sod) genes in maize", Biochemica et
      Biophysica Acta 882 p. 33 (1986) observed 54% increases in SOD
      levels but only a 40% increase in SOD activity, in response to a
      burst of superoxide radicals. Thus the resulting surplus of
      anti-oxidants lowers the normal levels of free radicals in seeds
      and in mature, developing plant tissue the MIR treated plants have
      lower redox ratio than in the untreated controls as shown in FIG.
      4.<br>
      <br>
      As shown in FIG. 5, the spatial drift of the MIR pulses outside
      the electrodes 11 and 12 can be examined by stationing an
      experimental probe coil 101 near the electrodes 11 and 12. A
      linear chart recorder 21 is used to detect the induced current in
      coil 101. The electron avalanches drift laterally from between the
      electrodes 11 and 12 and through an electrostatic-magnetic
      coupling induce a magnetic field in the coil 101, which in turn
      generates a potential in the millivolt range. With the coil 101
      placed directly across one channel of a dual channel chart
      recorder such as recorder 21 in FIG. 1A and the MIR system across
      the second channel, one can examine the effectiveness and form of
      the pulses in action. For example, the set of curves in FIG. 6
      show the magnetically induced and MIR pulses from the coupled
      system. The coil 101 usually has 10,000 to 100,000 turns,
      preferably 80,000 turns.<br>
      <br>
      As pointed out by H. Raether ("Electron Avalanches and Breakdown
      in Gasses", Butterworth &amp; Co. Ltd., U.K. 1964) one reliable
      criteria to know whether an observed current pulse can be
      identified with an avalanche process is to compare the form of the
      avalanche pulse with the induced magnetic component. From the
      basic theory of electron avalanche formation one should find that
      the induced magnetic component H (expressed here as coil 101
      potential) is directly related to ln(i), where i is the amplitude
      of the avalanche current pulse in the MIR system. The experimental
      data in FIG. 7 confirms (r=0.89; P&lt;0.05) that these are
      electron avalanches.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 2</b><br>
      <br>
      When the above steps are used together as part of a coherent
      process to treat the seeds in the aforementioned manner, the
      following results have been achieved in a variety of crops in both
      laboratory and field tests:<br>
      1) Increased rate of field emergence. An example is shown in FIG.
      8A for Glycine max. Var. PS-202 and in FIGS. 8B and 8C for two
      varieties of Zea mays sweet corn.<br>

      Carrots: Carrot seeds of variety Daucus carota Danvers 126 were
      planted May 31 1995 at Blissfield, Mich. and harvested Sep. 7,

      FIGS. 15, 16 and 17 show the results of aging of the seeds for a
      period of time. As can be seen the aging is very important.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 18 shows the results when oat seeds are treated in the
      panicle which tends to shield the seed from the electrons. As can
      be seen, the treatment is effective but less so than in FIG. 17.<br>
      <br>
      It is believed that the influence of the MIR process on seeds is
      based on the formation of electron-ion avalanches in air at normal
      atmospheric pressure and temperature. Under an applied electric
      potential, these avalanches can be directed as electron-ion
      impulses in the form of regular cycles or plasma waves. The
      frequency, amplitude and confinement of these pulses are governed
      by the applied potential and the design configurations of the MIR
      apparatus.<br>
      <br>
      In the MIR process there is a relationship between the
      electron-ion avalanche pulse formation and the manner in which
      they form an organized plasma. The avalanche formation takes place
      between parallel plate electrodes 11 and 12 at a potential
      sufficient to cause the electrons (e@-) leaving the cathode to
      gain enough energy to ionize air molecules through both elastic,
      and to a lesser degree, inelastic collisions. In the present MIR
      configuration the minimum potential for avalanche formation is
      around 0.5 KV/cm. In the electron-molecule collisions new e@- 's
      are formed and these plus the primary e@- keep repeating this
      process thus forming a cascading avalanche.<br>
      <br>
      The mean number (n) of drifting electrons e@- 's grow at,<br>
      <br>
      n(x)=exp (.alpha.x) (1)<br>
      <br>
      wherein x is the distance of e@- drift, and .alpha. the mean
      number of ionizing collisions per e@- per cm. Nasser (E. Nasser,
      Fundamentals of Gaseous Ionization and Plasma Electronics,
      Wiley-Interscience, New York (1971)) points out that after a time
      t' the electric field disappears within the avalanche so that the
      e@- swarm stops and attaches to molecules, that is, the plasma
      pulse is partially neutralized or discharged. This takes place
      inside the electrode gap if the drift path L of the avalanche is,<br>
      <br>
      L=vt' (2)<br>
      <br>
      wherein v, the e@- drift velocity is less than the electrode
      spacing distance d (in air, v is around 10@7 cm/sec.). With d=8
      cm, t' must be &lt;8.times.10@-7 sec. The positive ions (not shown
      in FIG. 1A) have a low v@+ of around 10@5 cm/sec and therefore
      have drifted very little from their point of production.<br>
      <br>
      The current i produced by an avalanche is,<br>
      <br>
      i=(.epsilon.n0 /t')exp (.alpha.v't) (3)<br>
      <br>
      If we take (.epsilon. n0 /t') as the rate constant k', for the
      avalanche formation,<br>
      <br>
      i=k'exp (.alpha.v'T) (4)<br>
      <br>
      where T is the transient time for one avalanche pulse, therefore<br>
      <br>
      ln(i)=k(.alpha.v'T) (5)<br>
      <br>
      wherein k is a new rate constant. Thus in (i) is proportional to
      the mean number of ionizing collisions (.alpha.) during an
      avalanche pulse of transient time T.<br>
      <br>
      One reliable criteria (H. Raether, Electron Avalanches and
      Breakdown in Gasses Butterworth &amp; Co., Ltd., Great Britain
      (1964)) to know whether an observed current pulse can be
      identified with an avalanche process is to measure and compare the
      growth of e@- 's with the theoretical relationship.<br>
      <br>
      n=exp (.alpha.v t) (6)<br>
      <br>
      In the MIR system there is no e@- confinement, therefore the
      avalanche pulses drift laterally outside the confines of the
      parallel plate electrodes. This external drift of plasma provides
      a method for experimentally examining the growth of electrons as
      predicted by the Equation-6 theoretical relationship. For this
      purpose an experimental probe coil 101 consisting of 80,000 turns
      of #40 copper wire, was positioned in proximity with the MIR
      system (FIG. 5). When placed directly across one channel of a
      linear chart recorder, any induced magnetic field is readily
      detected as a voltage pulse in the probe coil 101. Avalanche
      pulses of varying current amplitudes were formed within the MIR
      system and recorded on a separate recorder channel as shown in
      FIG. 6. Any induced field in the probe coil is taken as being
      proportional to the plasma density formed by the ionizing
      collisions. From Equation 5 the predicted relationship between a
      transient avalanche current s and the magnetic field H, induced by
      an ion-electron concentration (.alpha.) drifting across the test
      coil 101 would, under these hypothetical conditions be given by,<br>
      <br>
      H=c1 ln(i)+c2 (7)<br>
      <br>
      wherein c1 and c2 are proportionality constants.<br>
      <br>
      From chart recorder traces taken from experiments conducted over a
      range of electrode potentials, the amplitudes (in mv) of the
      plasma induced magnetic fields were compared with the amplitudes
      of the avalanche currents. These data (FIG. 7) plotted according
      to Equation 7 show good correlation (r=0.89; P&lt;0.05) between
      the theoretical model of plasma avalanches and the experimental
      data obtained from the MIR system.<br>
      <br>
      At a given potential the amplitudes and frequency of the avalanche
      pulses remain relatively constant over the transient intervals.
      The stability of the ion current pulses was examined by
      "injecting" excess electrons into an MIR system during a
      succession of stable avalanche pulses. If UV radiation is directed
      onto the cathode plate, electrons are released through the
      photoelectric effect. This can produce what has been called (H.
      Raether, Electron Avalanches and Breakdown in Gasses, Butterworth
      &amp; Co., Ltd., Great Britain (1964)) "Avalanches With
      Successors". Through the injection of additional secondary
      electrons the amplitudes of the avalanche pulse currents are
      increased.<br>
      <br>
      This photoelectric avalanche enhancement was produced in a MIR.
      system consisting of "Optical Transmitting Electrodes" or OTE's
      (glass coated with a semiconducting tin oxide film) as electrode
      12 arranged with electrode separation of 6 cm and 20 kV applied
      potential. As shown in FIG. 14, the effect of the electron
      injection is shown to take place 30 seconds after the start
      (indicated by arrow) of cathode exposure. Due to a shielding
      effect (E. Nasser, Fundamentals of Gaseous Ionization and Plasma
      Electronics, Wiley-Interscience, New York (1971)), a plasma will
      tend to remain stable even when external charges are introduced
      into the avalanche system. This initial delay followed by a rise
      to a maximum current amplitude at around 70 sec. followed by the
      gradual decline, is very consistent with the results obtained in
      other plasma systems, again confirming that it is a plasma
      electron avalanche process at work in the space between the
      electrodes. Exposure of the anode (polarity reversed) to UV had no
      effect (lower curve) on the current pulse amplitudes, as would be
      expected. using an anode which is wider than the cathode alters
      the shape of the electric field in a manner which contains more of
      the ion/electrons between the electrodes, allowing fewer to drift
      outside. The result is even more uniform and regular pulses of
      ion/electron avalanches.<br>
      <br>
      The commercial advantages of the present invention are:<br>
      <br>
      (1) Germination and Early Growth: With the MIR method the plant
      moves through the vulnerable, seedling stage faster. Greater
      uniformity at this stage limits the disadvantages of taller plants
      shading shorter ones and increases chances for all to thrive.
      Uniformity of growth also makes it easier to harvest the plants.<br>
      <br>
      (2) Root Growth: The MIR method is of particular value in plants
      such as navy beans where root growth is frequently a problem.<br>
      <br>
      (3) Accelerated Maturity: Accelerated maturity due to the MIR
      method is of economic advantage to farmers in crops, such as
      tomato and sweet corn, where the first produce to market each
      season commands much higher prices. In countries which double
      crop, it increases the likelihood that both crops will be able to
      mature and produce a full harvest. In far northern regions, with
      limited daylight and warm days in growing season, the MIR method
      increases the chances of a successful season.<br>
      <br>
      (4) Increased Yield: There are economic and humanitarian
      advantages to the MIR method. There is commercial appeal to the
      farmer, allowing him to grow more crop to produce income from the
      same farm. With world population growth outstripping food supply,
      any significant increases in yield is beneficial.<br>
      <br>
      Key features of the MIR method are:<br>
      <br>
      (1) Sharp, well-organized, uniform electron avalanches (not corona
      discharge, and not static electric fields). This is provided with
      a DC voltage source having an AC ripple.<br>
      <br>
      (2) Voltage potentials are 0.2 vK/cm to (but not including)
      dielectric spark gap breakdown discharge.<br>
      <br>
      (3) Anode electrode with the seeds.<br>
      <br>
      (4) Special electron feedback loop 15 enhances results.<br>
      <br>
      (5) Diagnostic Procedures.<br>
      <br>
      (6) A waiting period of several weeks between treatment and
      planting.<br>
      <br>
      (7) Redox ratio measurement provides quality control after
      treatment by the MIR method to confirm if effect was achieved,
      thus providing an immediate check on results.<br>
      <br>
      (8) Coil 101 recorder system provides an additional quality
      control to insure avalanches are in fact being produced, and have
      the proper form. Without this test, humidity and dust/debris on
      electrodes 11 and/or 12 could cause failure to produce avalanches
      (particularly when operating near the 0.5 kV/cm threshold, which
      is frequently used with some seeds.<br>
      <br>
      (9) The MIR method is practical and affordable for large scale
      commercial operations. Short time period of treatments are
      required (seconds to minutes) and small amounts of electricity are
      expended. The MIR method is suitable for conveyor-driven seed
      handling systems. The MIR method produces consistency of results.<br>
      <br>
      It is intended that the foregoing description be only illustrative
      of the present invention and that the present invention be limited
      only by the hereinafter appended claims.<br>

      A method for increasing the proportion of mutants in a generation
      in a first plant species having a recognized and established
      phenotype involves the simultaneous somatic exposure of germinal
      plants of the species to contact with whole cells and associated
      material of a second species of plants, and to electrophoretic
      conditions. The plants of the first species are preferably in a
      germinal state, such as seeds or seedlings, while the whole cells
      and associated materials of the second species can be a seedling
      root tip, a seedling, a tissue macerate (suspended in either water
      or agar) root nodules, fruit tissue or root tissue. When the cells
      of the first and second species have different membrane
      potentials, the step of electrophoretic exposure can be carried
      out by simply placing the cells in contact with one another.
      Preferably, however, an electropotential difference such as a
      constant DC voltage is disposed across the somatic cells of the
      first species of the plant and the whole cells and associated
      materials of the second species of plant, for example, by
      attaching one of a cathode and anode to the first species of
      plant, and the other of anode or cathode to the second species of
      plant.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>1. Field of the Invention</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The present invention relates to a method for inducing mutations
      in plants, and more particularly to a method for increasing the
      number of plants of a first species which exhibit a phenotype or
      characteristic normally associated with a different species.<br>
      <br>
      <b>2. Description of the Prior Art</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The members of a given species of plant typically share a number
      of well-established physical characteristics associated with the
      genetic materials of their cells; these characteristics are known
      as phenotypes. However, it is well known that plants of a given
      species having one or more new and distinctive characteristics,
      generally referred to as sports or mutations, occur naturally as a
      small fraction of any plant population. For centuries, mutants
      have been selectively bred to produce new varieties or
      modifications of existing plants. In natural populations of
      plants, however, the frequency of mutations is generally
      considered to be less than 1 in 500,000, so that the selection of
      desirable mutants after such breeding is a slow and laborious
      process, particularly since it is well recognized that mutants
      exhibiting a desirable phenotype are rare, and progeny outputs are
      often low.<br>
      <br>
      Several methods for increasing the occurrence of mutants in a
      population of a given species are well known; for example, the
      exposure of such a population to ionizing radiation. Such
      techniques, however, are typically subject to the drawbacks that
      the individually resulting mutants are generally weak, and must
      still be subjected to the time-consuming and labor-intensive
      techniques of isolation and selective breeding for a large number
      of generations, before a sufficient number of mutants possessing
      the new phenotype are obtained for use in outcrossing or
      agricultural growth.<br>
      <br>
      Recombinant DNA and protoplast fusion techniques are potentially
      useful for producing new varieties of plants without isolation of
      mutants or selective breeding. The use of these techniques is
      subject to several drawbacks, however. First, these techniques are
      tedious and slow, requiring elaborate instrumentation involving a
      large number of chemical processes, and a substantial investment
      in the education and training of the personnel conducting the
      procedures. Presently, these techniques are very expensive and
      time consuming. Indeed, Applicant is aware of no reported instance
      of the inducement of a functional expression of a novel gene
      (phenotype) from one species of plant to a population of another
      species of plant, employing these genetic engineering techniques.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE PRESENT INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The present invention overcomes these and other difficulties
      encountered in prior methods of inducing mutations in a population
      of a first species of plant by providing a method for increasing
      the number of mutants exhibiting altered phenotypic
      characteristics, characteristics which are stable in successive
      generations, where such phenotypic characteristics are an
      established trait of a second different species of plant. The
      method of the present invention allows for the production of large
      numbers of plants having substantial modifications from the parent
      generation, without the delay of several generations for selective
      breeding and establishment of characteristics as stable by
      outcrossing, and which does not require the complex
      instrumentation or large numbers of chemical reactants and steps
      inherent in present recombinant DNA or protoplast fusion
      techniques.<br>
      <br>
      The method according to the present invention involves placing a
      plurality of germinal plants of a first or recipient species, this
      first species exhibiting at least one established phenotype, in
      contact with the whole cells and associated materials of a second
      species of plant, while exposing the germinal plants of the first
      species to electrophoretic conditions, such as an ionophoretic
      current. The germinal plants are grown to adult plants, or to a
      stage sufficient to observe any changes from the established
      phenotype. The exposure of the germinal plants of the first
      species to electrophoretic conditions can be carried out by simply
      abutting a portion of seedlings of the first species with
      seedlings of a second plant species, when the cells of the first
      and second species have differing membrane potentials. This can be
      carried out by excising complimentary sections from the root of
      seedlings of the first and second plant species, and abutting the
      cut surfaces of the roots. Preferably, however, an external DC
      current is applied across the germinal first species plants and
      whole cells and associated materials of the second plant species
      by attaching an anode to the plants or materials of one species,
      and a cathode to the plants or cells of the other species.
      Typically the plants and materials are exposed to a constant DC
      voltage having a current density in the range of 10 to 100
      microamps per centimeters applied at a potential difference of
      from 1 to 50 volts for periods of five minutes to 24 hours. In
      effect, the donor material of the second species acts as an
      electrode substrate or base contactable with the seedlings of the
      first species. The donor material is prepared as either a tissue
      macerate or as whole tissue. The donor material can be placed on
      sterile cotton or a filter paper which in turn rest on a stainless
      steel plate electrode. Most preferably, the acceptor tissue or
      plants of the first species are exposed at the seed or early
      seedling stage, typically 24 to 96 hours after germination by
      placing the root apex in contact with the donor-coated electrode,
      and the shoot apex, cotyledons or coleoptile in contact with the
      electrode of opposite polarity.<br>
      <br>
      The method of the present invention is preferably carried out with
      genetically pure, stable and homozygous inbred varieties of lines
      as the host or acceptor first species. Such well-established lines
      were used in all of the examples described below, and are
      commercial varieties which have been released from university or
      USDA breeding programs for public use.<br>
      <br>
      After exposure, the test seedlings or germinal plants of the first
      species, along with untreated controls, are developed to maturity
      under field conditions or in a greenhouse, depending upon
      expediency. Typically, alterations are observed in the growth
      rates and yields of the germinal plants actually treated,
      depending upon the type of donor and the exposure parameters;
      however, a stable expression of an altered phenotype is typically
      not seen until at least the second generation bred from the
      treated plants. The frequency of inherited, varietal alterations
      resulting from the present method ranges from 5% to 95% of the
      test population, typically, depending upon the specific procedure
      and plant species involved. This is a substantial improvement over
      the proportion of one in a few thousands or several thousands of
      cells or plants treated by recombinant DNA and protoplast fusion
      methods.<br>
      <br>
      Not only does the present method yield a significantly increased
      proportion of mutants in the treated plants, but a significant
      proportion of the resulting mutants exhibit an altered phenotypic
      characteristic which was, in fact, an established phenotypic
      characteristic of the second or donor species of plant. It is
      believed that this transferred phenotype results from the
      transduction of genetically associated cell tissue components and
      macromolecular complexes from the second or donor species into the
      intact, somatic cells of the first or acceptor species, in such a
      manner as to alter the genotype and/or phenotype of the plants of
      the first species. For this reason, plants treated in accordance
      with the method of the present invention, or grown from plants
      treated in accordance with the present invention, are designated
      by generation with the letter "T". For example, the first treated
      generation of the first species of plant is described as the T-1
      generation, while a second inbred generation grown from the adult
      plants of the T-1 generation are referred to as the T-2
      generation. This designation of generations is intended to avoid
      confusion with the system of F-1, F-2 and so on, normally employed
      in conventional plant breeding, when crossing for hybrid vigor.<br>
      <br>
      It is thus an object of this invention to provide a method, by
      means of electrophoresis techniques, for the production of new
      plant mutations consisting of types and varieties having altered
      genotypic and/or phenotypic characteristics, that is simple when
      compared with the recombinant DNA and protoplast fusion methods
      known in the art. The methods of the present invention do not
      require complex instrumentation, nor drastic alterations in cell
      wall-membrane contiguity, particularly the removal of the cell
      wall as required by prior techniques, or detailed elucidation of
      chromosome maps.<br>
      <br>
      Another object of the present invention is to provide a method for
      the production of new varieties of plants that can quickly yield
      large numbers of healthy plants having substantial modifications
      from the parent plants, thus eliminating the delay of several
      generations and large test populations required in prior selective
      breeding programs, which have been conventionally necessary before
      the plants can be used in out-crossing. Both conventional breeding
      programs and the recombinant DNA and protoplast fusion methods
      generally produce a low yield of mutants which must be selectively
      grown and bred for a large number of generations, before a
      sufficient number of stable plants are available for use in
      programs for developing plant varieties; in contrast, the
      production of such stable plant varieties is remarkably more rapid
      in the present invention.<br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE
        PRESENT INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The method of the present invention both increases the proportion
      of mutants in a generation of a first species of plant (the
      species having at least one established phenotype) while
      simultaneously causing at least some of the resultant mutant
      plants to exhibit a phenotype, characteristic or trait of a second
      species of plant. Several illustrative techniques and specific
      examples of the present invention are described hereinafter. It
      should be understood that the technique of the present invention
      is generally intended to be used on a substantial number of plants
      sought to be modified, so as to provide a ready supply of mutant
      plants for subsequent varietal development. The electrophoretic
      techniques described however, can also clearly be conducted on a
      single plant cell as the acceptor, employing micromanipulative
      techniques in order to apply an ionophoretic current across the
      single acceptor cell and donor material. Such a technique is, of
      course, within the scope of the present invention. In such a case,
      the acceptor electrode can comprise a thin needle or wire inserted
      into or in contact with the acceptor cell. In all cases, however,
      the cell wall and plasmalemma are preferably not breached by the
      present method.<br>
      <br>
      It is believed that germinal plants, such as seeds or seedlings
      about one to five days after germinations, are most susceptible to
      successful treatment by the method of the present invention. While
      some variation may occur in the percentage of mutant plants grown
      from the treated seeds or seedlings, such as percentage varying
      with the species of plants used and the particular technique
      employed, the method of the present invention will generally
      result in a substantially greater percentage of mutations than
      results when radiation or the like are employed to create mutant
      plants. Moreover, whereas radiation and the like cause random
      mutations having widely varying characteristics, in general a
      substantial percentage of mutants formed by this invention tend to
      exhibit substantially similar characteristics.<br>
      <br>
      With reference first to FIG. 1, a first embodiment of the method
      of the present invention is thereshown involving a joined pair of
      seedlings 10 of two different species of plants. One or more
      seedlings 12 of first species of plant are prepared by
      longitudinally excising a section consisting of about one-half of
      the root's side, to expose a fresh cut surface 16. Preferably, the
      germinated seedlings include radicles in the range of 1 to 6
      centimeters in length, and the radicle tip is left intact when the
      surface is cut, exposing the procambium, protophleom and
      protoxylem cells. The root side and tip of a corresponding number
      of seedlings 14 of a second, different species of plant are
      excised, the radicle tip as well as the longitudinal portion of
      the side being removed, to form a cut surface 18. The seedlings 14
      of the second species are preferably of similar radicle
      development as the seedlings 12 of the first species, and the
      procambium, protophloem and protoxylem of the seedlings 14 of the
      second species similarly form the cut surface 18.<br>
      <br>
      The cut surfaces 16 and 18 of the two species of plants are then
      immediately abutted and a thin cord is wrapped or tied about the
      abutted roots in order to insure good contact between them and
      maintain them in abutment. The excisions on each of the seedlings
      12 and 14 should be complementary in order to maximize contact
      between the cut surfaces 16 and 18. The joined seedlings 10 are
      planted and nurtured to adult plants, at which time either seeds
      from the plants are harvested for growth of a T-2 generation from
      which plants having desired traits are selected; or the T-1 adult
      plants are directly selected for desired traits. The former is the
      particularly preferred procedure in this invention.<br>
      <br>
      In the embodiment disclosed in FIG. 1, the seedlings 14 of the
      acceptor species are exposed to electrophoretic conditions through
      the existence of a difference between the natural membrane
      potentials known to exist about both plant and animal cells,
      Jaffe, Nature, 256: 600-602 (1977). Although natural membrane
      potentials are known to be of low magnitudes, generally on the
      order of 1 to 100 millivolts, the adjacent disposition of cells of
      different species will result in a mutual electrophoretic process.
      Because each plant species has its own distinctly characteristic
      metabolic cycle and timing of activity, the biochemical cycles in
      plants 12 of one species will likely be at a phase different from
      that of plants 14 of the second species. Consequently, since at
      one growth stage the mutual potentials may be complementary and at
      another stage of development they may be opposed, this can provide
      a potential gradient quite different from that which the cells of
      the plants 12 of the first species would experience under normal
      conditions of development.<br>
      <br>
      Because the plant radicle or root tip is responsible for the
      production of vitamins and other important enzymes used in the
      development of germinal plants, the plant 14 having the root tip
      excised will be acceptor plant, while the plant 12 having the root
      tip retained will be the donor plant.<br>
      <br>
      Applicant has measured the current density in the region where the
      cut tissues contact, when abutted as disclosed in FIG. 1. For
      example, when four day old seedlings from different species such
      as corn and soybean are paired, the current density reaches a
      maximum value of about 0.7 microamperes per square centimeter at
      about 40 minutes after initial abutment, with a very gradual
      decline over the next 10 hours. In contrast, when seedlings of the
      same species are paired in a similar fashion, such as
      soybeam-soybean pairings, the current density is only around 0.01
      microamperes per square centimeter, again showing a very gradual
      decline with time. Typically, even at this low electric potential
      difference between the seedlings of disparate species, new traits
      appear in the acceptor plants at about a 5% mutuation level and
      are often in the nature of phenotypical alterations such as plant
      shape, size and foliage color. The T-1 generation is then selfed
      to yield a T2 generation, and the altered phenotypes exhibited by
      the mutated members of the new generations do not segregate out in
      succeeding generations.<br>
      <br>
      With reference now to FIG. 2, a second preferred embodiment of the
      invention is thereshown in which the natural membrane potential
      difference between seedlings of two different species is augmented
      or reversed, as desired, by the application of an ionophoretic
      current across the joined seedlings. More particularly, the root
      tips of seedlings 12 and 14 of two different species are excised,
      and the cut portions of the seedlings abutted together. A pair of
      electrodes 22 are then afixed to the seedlings 12 and 14 generally
      opposite the abutted root portions, for example, in the shoots or
      cotyledons. An electrical potential such as provided by a constant
      direct electrical current is then applied through the electrodes
      22 across the pair of joined seedlings 20. The voltage applied to
      the seedlings will generally range between 1 to 45 volts, and
      preferably on the order of 1.5 to 22.5 volts, for times of about 5
      minutes to 24 hours, and preferably about 5 minutes to about 3
      hours. This yields a current density across the region where the
      cut seedlings abut one another in a range of about 10 to 100
      microamperes per square centimeter. Preferably, the direction of
      current applied is chosen to augment the difference in membrane
      potential of the cells between the different species of plants.
      Once subjected to such a potential, the seedling pairs 20 are then
      separated into individual seedlings 12 and 14, which are
      separately nurtured to adult plants. The selfed T2 generation from
      the treated T1 generation plants are then selected for desired
      traits.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably, the electrodes 22 are constructed from iron, since
      iron electrodes can be inserted into the seedlings without causing
      detrimental effects to the seedlings. Other electrodes which are
      not deleterious to plants can also be used, and stainless steel
      electrodes are particularly preferred for this purpose.<br>
      <br>
      The donor material employed in the present invention need not be a
      whole plant or seedling. Instead, as shown in FIG. 3, tissues of a
      donor species of plant can be macerated, such as by blending in
      water, in order to produce an aqueous donor liquor. The aqueous
      liquor is collected and added to a support medium such as agar or
      gelatin, to produce a treated medium 26. The treated medium 26 is
      disposed in a test tube or vial 28, or other convenient container,
      and the root tip of the seedlings 14 of the second species of
      plant are placed in contact with or immersed in the medium 26.
      Most preferably, the radicle of the acceptor plant seedling 14 is
      placed in the medium. Once electrode is contacted with the shoot
      of the seedling, while another electrode is disposed in contact
      with the support medium 26. An electrical potential is then
      applied across the seedling 14 and medium 26, of the type, time
      and intensity described in the preceding embodiment. Following the
      application of this electrical potential, the seedlings 14 are
      removed from the treated medium 26 and grown to adult plants,
      which are then either selected for desired traits or are selfed in
      order to determine which traits in a T2 generation are inheritable
      and stable.<br>
      <br>
      The use of agar or gelatin as a medium 26 for suspending the
      aqueous liquor is desirable, but not essential to use of an
      aqueous liquor of the donor plant cells. In the embodiment shown
      in FIG. 3, the medium can be replaced by the aqueous liquor
      itself. Moreover, the aqueous liquor can itself be subjected to an
      electrical potential prior to its contact with the acceptor
      seedling 14, as shown in FIGS. 4 through 6. As above, the tissue
      of the donor species of plant is macerated in distilled water, and
      the resulting liquor 30 collected. The aqueous liquor 30 is then
      deposited in a petri dish 32, and a positive electrode 34 and a
      negative electrode 36 are placed in the aqueous liquid 30. An
      electrical potential 38 is then applied to the aqueous liquor 30
      across the positive electrode 34 and the negative electrode 36.
      While the electrodes can be constructed from silver, it is
      preferred that the electrodes are constructed from platinum in
      order to reduce oxidation of the electrodes, and minimize the
      effect of the electrode material upon the aqueous liquor 30.
      Generally a potential of about 5 to 20 volts is applied for a time
      of about 10 to 30 minutes. Consitutents of the aqueous liquor will
      migrate towards or away from one or the other of the electrodes 34
      and 36, depending upon the charge possessed by the various tissue
      constituents. As shown in FIG. 5, the portion of the aqueous
      liquor 30 which is located about the anode or positive electrode
      34 (the anode solution) is removed from the remainder of the
      aqueous liquor 30 by withdrawal into a hypodermic syringe 40. The
      portion of the liquor 30 surrounding the negative electrode or
      cathode 36 (the cathode solution) is removed by drawing into a
      syringe 42.<br>
      <br>
      The syringes 40 and 42 containing the anode and cathode solutions
      are then inserted into opposite ends of seedlings 14 of the
      acceptor species, as shown in FIG. 6, and pressure is applied to
      the syringes 40 and 42 to inject a portion of the anode and
      cathode solutions to the tissue of the seedlings. For example, the
      anode solution contained in the syringe 40 can be inserted into
      the shoot 44 of the seedling 14, while the cathode solution
      contained in the syringe 42 can be injected into the root of the
      seedling 14, preferably into the radicle 46. The positive
      electrode 34 and negative electrode 36 are then connected to the
      syringes 42 and 40, respectively (opposite to the electrodes from
      which the syringes collected a portion of the aqueous liquor), the
      syringes preferably having metal tips to facilitate electrical
      contact with the seedling 14. A potential difference of about 1 to
      50 volts and preferably of about 1.5 to 22.5 volts is applied to
      the seedling through the syringes for a time of about 5 minutes to
      24 hours, and preferably for about 5 minutes to about 3 hours.
      Subsequent to the application of the potential difference, the
      needles are removed from the seedling 14, and the seedling 14
      grown to an adult plant. A plurality of seedlings are selected for
      the desired traits in either the T1 or T2 generation, as described
      earlier.<br>
      <br>
      In another preferred embodiment of the present invention, only one
      of the electrode solutions needs to be applied to the acceptor
      species of plant in order to obtain the high proportion of
      mutations encountered in the present invention. With particular
      reference to FIG. 7, either of the anode or cathode solutions
      collected by the syringes 40 and 42 can be applied to a porous
      medium, such as a filter paper 48. A seedling 14 of the acceptor
      species of plant is positioned on the filter paper 48 with both
      its radical 46 and its shoot 44 in contact with the filter paper
      48 containing the donor electrode solution. The donor-containing
      filter paper 48 is placed in contact with a first electrode 50
      while a second electrode 52 of opposite polarity is inserted into
      the shoot 44 of the seedling 14. As above, the polarity of the
      electrode 50 in contact with the filter paper 48 is opposite to
      the sign of the electrode 40 or 42 from which the anode or cathode
      solution was collected. Because at least some of the constituents
      of the anode or cathode solution will be of the type to migrate
      towards the electrode opposite in sign so that of the electrode 50
      in contact with the filter paper, these constituents will tend to
      migrate towards the second electrode 52 upon the application of
      the potential difference across the electrodes 50 and 52, and
      thereby across the seedling 14. The length of time and type and
      strength of potential difference applied across the seedling 14
      are as disclosed above. Subsequent to the application of the
      potential difference, the electrodes 50 and 52 are removed from
      the seedling, and the seedling 14 grown to either the T-1 or T-2
      generation, and selected for any desired traits. The electrodes 50
      and 52 are preferably constructed of iron or stainless steel,
      because of their minimal effects on biological systems.<br>
      <br>
      It should be evident that the embodiments disclosed in FIGS. 3 and
      7 are readily adaptable to use in exposing a single cell or
      isolated protoplast cell of an acceptor species to the aqueous
      liquor or cathode or anode solutions from the donor species. More
      particularly, in FIG. 9 there is disclosed another preferred
      embodiment of the present invention in which a pair of
      non-reactive electrodes 70 and 72 (preferably platinum electrodes)
      are used to place an electrical potential across a single plant
      cell or isolated protoplast 74. The cell 74 is carried on the end
      of a glass tube 76, the tube 76 being filled with water 78 or
      another conductive liquid so as to permit manipulation of the cell
      74 within the tube 76. The use of a water-filled tube to carry a
      single plant cell is, of course, a known micromanipulative
      technique. One of the electrodes, for example, the cathode 72, is
      electrically connected through the tube 76 and disposed in contact
      with the liquid 78 in the tube 76. The other of the electrodes,
      for example, the anode, is electrically connected through the wall
      of another glass tube 80 and disposed in contact with a donor
      medium 82 contained in the tube 80. The donor medium 82 is the
      same as the media prepared in accordance with the preceeding
      embodiment of the invention. Pressure is applied to the medium 82
      to express a small droplet 84 of the medium 82 out of the end of
      the glass tube 80. The tubes 76 and 80 are mounted to a
      micromanipulator (not shown), which aligns the tubes 76 nd 80 and
      permits the droplet 84 to be brought into contact with the plant
      cell 74. Alignment and contact can be visually monitored through a
      microscope 86. The plant cell 74 is then subjected to
      electrophoretic conditions by the application of a DC voltage
      across the electrodes 70 and 72. The applied voltage should be
      sufficient to produce a current density in the range of 1.0 to 100
      microamps per square centimeter, for a time of about minutes to
      three hours.<br>
      <br>
      A final preferred embodiment of the general method of present
      invention is shown in FIG. 8 in which a seed 62 of an acceptor
      species of plants id disposed between two pieces of porous
      material or filter paper 54 and 56. Cathode and anode solutions of
      a tissue macerate of a donor species are prepared as described
      above. The filter papers 54 and 56 are placed on electrodes 58 and
      60, and infused with the anode or cathode solution collected from
      the electrode 34 or 36 of potential opposite to the electrodes 58
      and 60. One of the filter papers 54 or 56 is placed in contact
      with the hilum or embryo end of the seed 62. The electrodes 58 and
      60 can be constructed of various materials, preferably stainless
      steel or other iron material. It is preferred that the electrodes
      do not contact the seed 62 directly. An electric potential is the
      applied to the electrodes 58 and 60, and thus applied across the
      seed 62. The potential can be applied to the dry seed 62, or the
      seed can be allowed to be partially or completely imbibed with
      water or the anode and cathode solutions, before the potential
      difference is applied. A constant direct current of 20 to 90 volts
      is applied to the dry seeds, or a potential of 1 to 40 volts is
      applied to the partially imbibed seeds, for about 5 minutes to 1
      hour. After such treatment, the seed may be returned to the
      quiescent state and stored until it is convenient to plant them.
      Alternatively, the seeds may be germinated immediately, sprouted
      and grown to adult plants. Adults in the T2 generation, selfed
      from the T1 plants, are selected for desired traits.<br>
      <br>
      The methods of the present invention are further illustrated by
      several following examples. Some of the examples have been
      followed through the T5 generation in extensive agricultural
      testing. In general, it has been found in the invention that the
      induced mutations recognizably segregate in the T2 or subsequent
      generations, so that selections for further crossings or further
      development can accordingly be made in the T2 generation. For the
      most careful screening of the types of mutations, it has been fund
      advantageous to examine plant row tests in the T2 generations,
      that is, to use seeds from the individual treated plants of the T1
      generation for inbred or selfed plant row replications, in the T2
      generation testing. This allows a more efficient screening and
      categorization of the induced mutations from the T1 generation
      since traits or characteristics which are not reproduced in a
      selfed or inbred generation are neither stable nor of particular
      commercial value.<br>
      <br>
      The high percentage of mutants obtained in the method of the
      present invention allows a relatively small number of seeds or
      seedlings to be treated in the T1 generation (which is also
      referred to as the transduced series), on the order of 15 to 20
      seedlings of each transduction polarity being examined for
      differences in growth and for phenotypic variations, along with a
      control group of untreated seedlings or seeds of equal number.
      Thus, about one-third of the plants field tested at the time of
      the T1 generation are control plants. After the T1 generation,
      each of the treated lines and controls are grown in three
      replicated rows of 40 to 50 seeds each within statistically
      randomized test plots. Unless otherwise indicated, the Latin
      Square method of randomization was employed. Subsequent to the T2
      generation the lines are selected and expanded according to the
      apparent importance of the new characteristics of the mutant
      plants.<br>
      <br>
      The acreage necessary to adequately insure that the new
      characteristics are stabilized in the particular treated lines
      will vary according to the percentage of mutants obtained in the
      T1 generation and the number of lines that appear desirable to
      investigate. For example, in 1984, applicant produced T1
      transduced series of acceptor species including corn, tomato, soy
      beans and navy beans. Less than a one acre test plot was required
      for 124 transduction series and controls. These particular tests
      were made in lower Michigan. By 1985, the subsequent T3 generation
      testing involved an area of 10 acres, while the 1986 T5 generation
      required over 70 acres of primary growth, in addition to
      replicated tests at several locations and in several states. The
      T2 and T4 generations of these transduced series were seed
      expansion grow-outs in Hawaii, in order to shorten the time
      necessary to achieve the T5 generation.<br>
      <br>
      The following examples serve to further illustrate the present
      invention:<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE ONE</b><br>
      <br>
      Longitudinal sections from soy bean (Glycine max) seedling roots
      (the donor species) were excised in a plurality of seedlings, and
      longitudinal sections including the root tip were excised from a
      plurality of bush bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) seedlings (the
      acceptor species). Each seedling has a radicle in the range of 1
      to 6 centimeters in length, and the excised portions were of
      complementary shape, such as to expose the procambium, protophloem
      and protoxylem cells of each root tip. The cut portions of pairs
      of seedlings of the different species were abutted and bound with
      thread, as shown and described in conjunction with FIG. 1. The
      pairs of joined seedlings were grown to adult plants.<br>
      <br>
      One in twenty bush bean seedlings so treated resulted in an adult
      plant that was shorter than the control plants and which has more
      compact foliage than the control plants, characteristics which are
      of commercial importance in the harvesting of bush beans. Tall
      plants tend to lodge and intertwine, and are thus less efficiently
      harvested. These plants also had leaves of a deeper green color
      than the control plants, the fruit of these plants and these
      plants exhibited greater drought resistance than the control
      plants. Yields under field condition, however, were found to abe
      about the same as those of the control plants. The seeds of these
      plants were observed to be intermediate in shape between the soy
      bean and bush bean progenator seeds.<br>
      <br>
      These new characteristics were stable; they were observed without
      change through seven inbred or selfed generations with no
      reversion back to the height, bushiness, color, sweetness, and
      drought resistance of the original and control bush bean plants.
      Six generations of the mutated plants, along with an equal number
      of controls, were grown under field test conditions as described
      earlier. The maintenance of these characteristics for seven
      generations demonstrates that the changes were inheritable. The
      fact that the inbred, transduced plants do not segregate or
      revert, that is, return to the characteristics of the control
      plants, demonstrates that the method can provide new varieties of
      plants which breed true. As will be subsequently discussed, this
      non-segregating, stable nature of the growth alterations suggests
      a non-Mendelian or cytoplasmic type of inheritance.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>EXAMPLE TWO</b><br>
      <br>
      Longitudinal sections from a plurality of bush bean seedlings
      (Phaseolus vulgaris) roots, the donor species, and longitudinal
      sections including the root tips from soy bean (Glycine max)
      seedlings, the acceptor species, were excised to expose procambim,
      protophlem and protoxylum cells on each seedling. Each seedling
      was germinated and possessed radicles in the range of 1 to 6
      centimeters in length. The excised portions of pairs of seedlings
      of different species were cut in complementary shapes, and the
      exposed cut portions of the seedlings were joined together to form
      pairs of joined seedlings in the fashion shown in and described in
      conjunction with FIG. 1. Each pair of joined seedlings contained a
      bush bean seedling and a soy bean seedling. The pairs of seedlings
      were then grown to adult soy bean plants, and one in ten of the
      soy bean plants so grown exhibited seeds that were intermediate in
      shape and color between the seeds of the bush bean and the soy
      bean progenators. The leaves of the one in ten altered soy bean
      plants were less lobed in shape than the leaves of the control
      plants, the stem node lengths were reduced as compared to those of
      the soy bean control plants, and the number of stem nodes was
      increased as compared to the controls as well. This resulted in a
      line of altered soy bean plants which had more compact foliage
      than the control plants and was thus more resistant to lodging
      under field conditions. These changed characteristics were
      maintained in inbred or selfed plants grown through four
      generations. Three of these generations were grown along with an
      equal number of controls under field conditions.<br>
      <br>
      This example is, of course, the reciprocal or reverse of the
      transduction which occured in Example 1, that is, the donor and
      acceptor species are reversed. Significantly, the percentage of
      altered or mutated plants obtained is of the same order of
      magnitude in each example, demonstrating that the method allows
      modifications to be made to plants in two directions. Typically,
      attempts to induct positive and viable mutations in plants by
      conventional methods such as by chemical or ionizing radiation
      treatments yields an expected frequency of useful, viable
      mutations or phenotypic alterations of one in five hundred
      thousand test plants (a frequency equal to 0.000002). Examples 1
      and 2 demonstrate that the method of the invention can produce
      plants having new, inheritable characteristics at a rate of 25,000
      times that expected under conditions of conventional chemical or
      radiation treatment. This increase in the rate of mutation is
      highly significant and commercially valuable in terms of time,
      space, and the volume of plants needed to be treated or exposed in
      order to produce positive mutations.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE THREE</b><br>
      <br>
      Tissue from the immature fruit of tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum)
      was macerated in distilled water and the resulting aqueous liquor
      placed in a perti dish. A pair of spaced silver electrodes were
      inserted in the macerate liquor and a constant direct current
      electrical potential of 9 volts was applied for 20 minutes. A
      portion of the liquor surrounding each electrode was drawn into a
      hypodermic syringe having a conductive needle tip. The conductive
      syringe tips were inserted into the root and shoot of a plurality
      of soy bean (Glycine max) seedlings in the fashion shown in and
      described in conjunction with FIG. 5, 6 and 6, above. A negative
      electrode was then connected to the syringe containing the
      solution which has surrounded the positive electrode in the petri
      dish, while a positive electrode was connected to the syringe
      containing the other electrode solution. A constant DC electrical
      potential of 22.5 volts was then applied for five minutes, so that
      a current of approximately 100 microamps was passed through the
      seedlings.<br>
      <br>
      Two series of 20 seedlings were treated and grown along with 20
      non-treated controls. In one treated series, the electrode
      solution from the positive electrode in the petri dish was applied
      to the seedling roots. In the other series, the electrode solution
      from the negative electrode in the petri dish was applied to the
      roots of the seedlings. After such treatments, all of the
      seedlings were grown under field test conditions as described
      above, and the results obtained are given in Table I below. The
      asterisk indicates data which is statistically significant at
      about a 95% confidence level (P less than 0.05). The observed
      increases in pod and seed yields continued in two subsequent
      generations of selfed or inbred plants, grown under field test
      growth conditions.<br>

      <b>EXAMPLE FOUR</b><br>
      <br>
      A portion of root tissue from Eastern Marsh Cabbage Plant
      (Symplocarpus foetidus) was excised in early Spring (mid-March),
      macerated in distilled water and admixed with a sufficient
      quantity of agar to create a donor macerate of moderate viscosity.
      A portion of this donor macerate was placed in a test tube. The
      radicles of a plurality of tomato seedling (Lycopersicon
      esculentum) were immersed in the donor medium. One electrode was
      inserted into each of the seedlings, while another was positioned
      in contact with the donor medium. A direct current 9 volt
      potential difference was applied across the electrodes, and thus
      across the seedlings and macerate, for five minutes.<br>
      <br>
      Tomato is well known to be one of the agronomic crops which can be
      commercially grown both under greenhouse and field conditions,
      while it has been noted that the Marsh Cabbage possesses a high
      metabolic output in its early stages of growth, R. M. Knutson,
      Science 186: 746-747 (1974). In view of the hypothetical model set
      forth in the discussion following the examples herein, and in
      light of the fact that certain characteristics of the transduced
      plants in Examples 1 and 2 were intermediate the characteristics
      of the donor and acceptor species, it was thought there was a
      significant chance that the high metabolic output of Marsh Cabbage
      could be imparted to tomato seedlings to increase their fruit
      yields, and thereby increase the commercial value of the crop.<br>
      <br>
      A number of tomato seedlings so treated were grown in a
      greenhouse, and the number of plants resulting from treatment, and
      the number of fruit borne by those plants at the time of fruit
      ripening, are shown in Table II. Both the positive and negative
      electrode orientation data were combined in the data reported in
      Table II, since in this case there were no apparent polarity
      differences. Again, the asterisk indicates data which is
      significant at a 95% confidence level (P less than 0.05).<br>

      This same donor/host transduction was repeated for the purpose of
      examining yield levels under field conditions. Using three
      different varieties, a total of 24 test series were prepared with
      30 transduced seedlings in each series (15 per electrode polarity)
      plus 15 control, non-transduced plants. Exposure was again
      conducted with the apparatus shown in, and the method described in
      conjunction with, FIG. 3, at a direct current potential of 9 volts
      and an exposure time of five minutes. All plants were handles and
      reared under similar conditions of field environment. Yields from
      individual plants were recorded at the time of optimum fruit
      harvest (approximately two-thirds mature fruit per plant).<br>
      <br>
      Of the 24 test series, 7 of them, or 29.2%, disclosed a
      statistically significant yield advantage (based on mean weight of
      fruit per plant) over the control or non-transduced groups, at a
      confidence level of 95% (P less than 0.05). Within the groups
      showing yield increases, there were also concomitant,
      statistically significant increases in growth rates and in plant
      size. The yield data possessing this significance ranged from +35%
      to +70% fruit weight increases over the controls. An experienced
      plant geneticist and breeder observing the transduced series
      selected one with a +50% (P less than 0.05) yield increase as
      having improved phenotypic characteristics for traits desirable
      for commercial harvesting, specifically, upright plants having
      good clustering of fruit.<br>
      <br>
      Individual plants were selected and grown in T2 generation field
      replications as plant rows (30 plants per row) from this
      particular exceptional plant series as well as from several of the
      T1 generation series, including some that showed no yield
      advantages. Yields were again recorded in the T2 generation. These
      plants row data disclosed that those plants showing growth and
      yield advantages in the T1 generation also gave high growth rates
      and yields in the T2 generation, whereas those showing no growth
      or yield advantages in the T1 generation gave no growth or yield
      increases in the T2 generation. From the T1 generation exceptional
      progenitor plant, a total of 10 plant rows gave statistically
      significant yield advantages ranging from +40.7% to +55.6%,
      compared with the T2 generation control plant yields. T3 inbred
      generations of these high yielding plants are currently being
      compared in several large scale field tests (approximately five
      acres at four different locations) with two high yield commercial
      varieties, as well as with the non-transduced F3 generation
      controls. In all locations the transduced line is still showing
      significant growth and development advantages over the
      non-transduced varieties.<br>
      <br>
      This example illustrates the consistency of the induced phenotypic
      effects and practical increases in the rates of fruit production
      in a commercially valuable crop, when the method of the present
      invention is practiced.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE FIVE</b><br>
      <br>
      The Symplocarpus foetidus root tissue used as donor material in
      Example Four was prepared in the early spring (mid-March) growth
      period, when the metabolic activity in the root was at a high
      rate. Donor tissue prepared from different tissue regions of the
      donor plant and taken at a later stage of maturity can have
      significantly different effects on the growth rate in the acceptor
      plant Lycopersicon esculentum. Tissues from the root, the
      development spadix in the lower stem of the plant, and the leaf
      foliage of the Marsh Cabbage were collected in mid-April, and
      donor macerates were prepared as described in Example Four and
      shown in FIG. 3. Seedlings from four different commercial and
      established varieties of tomato plants were treated with these
      macerates and with a direct current 9 volt potential and five
      minute exposure. The tomato seedlings were grown under greenhouse
      conditions and periodic growth data was obtained. Table III
      presents data obtained at six weeks of growth which shows the
      percentage of the total series which possessed growth
      statistically significantly higher (P less than 0.05) than the
      corresponding control series.<br>

      <br>
      The foliage employed as a donor, with its high rate of protein
      synthesis, yielded the highest percentage of tests showing
      significant growth increases in the acceptor series, when compared
      with the controls. It is noteworthy that the root macerate used in
      the above test produced significant growth increases in only 2.8%
      of the series, whereas in Example Four the root tissue obtained
      about one month earlier (when at its high level of metabolic
      activity) induced high growth in 29.2% of the test series.<br>
      <br>
      This example serves to illustrate the importance of the selection
      of tissue for the transduction donor, as well as considering its
      state of maturity.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE SIX</b><br>
      <br>
      Many varieties of plants in the pea and bean family (legumes) have
      the ability to more efficiently utilize or fix nitrogen from the
      atmosphere than other plants. This diazotrophy occurs through
      bacteria which live symbiotically on the plant roots and form
      outgrowths or root nodules. The results of this example suggest
      that an acceptor species in the cereal family such as corn, which
      does not fix nitrogen, could have mutations and growth stimulation
      induced therein from a donor bean species which has these root
      nodules.<br>
      <br>
      A donor extract was prepared from soy bean (Glycine max) root
      nodules excised from plants grown from seeds which were initially
      inoculated with the bacterium Rhizobium japonicum, which is known
      to produce diazatrophy in soy beans. The macerated nodule liquor
      was mixed uniformly with agar as a base, and corn (Zeas mays) and
      sunflower (Helianthus annuus) seedlings were both treated with
      this donor extract in fashion shown in and described in
      conjunction with FIG. 3.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE SIX (A)</b><br>
      <br>
      Both corn and sunflower seedlings were placed in the base medium
      and exposed to a potential giving an initial current of about 30
      microamps through the seedlings. After exposure the seedlings
      (along with equal numbers of controls) were planted in a field
      test plot, with no fertilizer added. Growth and development
      studies were conducted on three separate test series of corn and
      two separate test series of sunflower seedlings. The growth and
      development enhancement produced by the root nodule extract
      treatment was consistently observed in all five test series.
      Examples of growth and development data are presented in Table IV
      for a field test series of corn and in Table V for a field test
      series of sunflower plants. The corn seedlings were exposed to the
      current for one hour, with the cathode inserted into the donor
      medium; the data of Table IV were obtained from twelve plants in
      each series. The sunflower seedlings were exposed to the current
      for 30 minutes, with the cathode inserted into the donor medium;
      the data of Table V were obtained from twenty plants in each
      series. The differences in growth shown in the last column of each

      In these field test series, the polarity conditions were limited
      to the donor medium electrode being the cathode. The reason for
      examining only the one polarity condition was the fact that
      preliminary studies with the soybean root-nodule extract disclosed
      a greater growth response with the donor medium media electrode
      being negative than with the medium electrode being positive.<br>
      <br>
      This example shows the induction of more efficient growth,
      development and yield from the root-nodule extracts, as compared
      to the control plants.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE SIX (B)</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Corn seedlings were placed in the donor medium and exposed to a
      direct current 15 volt potential giving an initial current in the
      range of 30 microamps through the seedlings. After 10 minute
      exposures, groups of 15 test seedlings along with equal number of
      controls were planted in a field test plot, no fertilizer added,
      and growth data taken periodically during the growth cycle. The
      test was conducted with five pure and commercially available
      inbred varieties, Mo17-Ht, A634-Ht, A632-Ht, B73-Ht and W117-Ht,
      and thus provided range of different lines of stable but
      homozygous test material. The use of different inbred lines also
      provided a germ plasm for subsequent hybrid crossing studies.<br>
      <br>
      A total of 18 test series were prepared and examined under field
      conditions in accord with this protocol. The observed development
      alterations in the T1 generation were primarily in the rates of
      maturity or tassel development, in growth rates and in changes in
      root structure and morphology. The roots in several of the treated
      series disclosed a much more branching or dendritic patterning,
      with thickening at the terminus of the root. The roots of the
      control plants had less branching with no thickening at their
      termini. This formation of inchoate nodules and alterations in the
      root morphology of the corn plant is indicative of the initial
      stages of diazotrophy induction in this cereal plant. Plants from
      those groups disclosing significant increases in the rate of
      tasseling or growth were then selected on an individual plant
      basis for T2 generation self pollination. These T2 general plants
      were then used in T3, T4 and T5 generations, for both inbred and
      hybrid crosses.<br>
      <br>
      The advantage of the use of genetically pure, homozygous inbred
      varieties or lines as the acceptor materials is that mutations in
      corn can be keyed to alterations in particular chromosomes from
      known listings. Specifically in the case of corn, new genotypic
      and phenotypic expressions can be compared with those listed in
      The Mutants of Maize, N. G. Neuffer, et al Crop Science Society of
      America (Madison, Wisc.), 1968; and Maize for Biological Research,
      W. F. Sheridan, Ed. Plant Molecular Biology Association,
      (University Press, N. Dak.), 1982. It is well known to those
      skilled in the art that if a particular characteristic appears in
      a subsequent generation of a plant line where this characteristic
      was not previously present, a point mutation has occurred on a
      particular chromosome. Indeed, these point mutations are cataloged
      in this fashion.<br>
      <br>
      The treatment of corn seedlings by the present invention with the
      soybean root module donor material produced a number of changes in
      characteristics in the T2 generation which are known to be
      associated with particular point mutations. In particular, a
      number of these mutations are known to be located on chromosome
      which occurred in the T2 generation plants obtained from some of
      the treated series. A summary of the frequency of mutations found
      in two of the inbred treated series (derived from the A632-Ht
      acceptor) are listed below in Table VI. There were no mutations or
      phenotypic alterations (a zero percent level) observed in several
      thousand control or non-transduced plants from this same inbred
      line.<br>

      The probability of any one of these mutations occuring in one
      plant by change alone is about 1 in 500,000 whereas in Table VI
      there are shown several cases in which a number of plants
      expressed two mutations and in one case, a single plant expressed
      three mutuations. Now, from the laws of strict probability, the
      odds that these percentages occurred by random chance are, in the
      case of two mutuations on the same plant, one in 2.5.times.10@11
      and, in the case of three mutuations on the same plant, one in
      1.25.times.10@17. In addition to point mutuations, other
      transduced series were observed to express large increases in
      point mutuations which are known to involve several gene alleles.
      Examples of these multiple allele mutuations are listed below in
      Table VII.<br>

      The data of Table VII show a mutuation increase for both albino
      and luteus of about a thousand times the level observed in the
      control population. Many of these mutations are not of commercial
      interest. For example, albino plants do not produce chlorophyll
      and expire before maturity. However, there were other mutations
      which have importance in plant breeding. The dwarf plants listed
      in Table VI are an example of a useful mutation. These plants are
      about one half the height of the control plants, but the ear size
      and production were comparable to those of the controls. This
      normal ear size on the mutuant dwarf plants is an important and
      commercially beneficial distinction from dwarf corn plants derived
      from conventional breeding programs, the difference being that the
      ears on the conventionally bred dwarf plants are small when
      compared with the normal hybrid ears, and have large areas on the
      ears which do not develop kernels at all.<br>
      <br>
      Field studies of dwarf plants obtained from corn seedlings treated
      in accordance with the method of the present invention establish
      the existence of a number of commercially important
      characteristics. The following has been shown to be true from five
      generations of field trials:<br>
      <br>
      The inbred, dwarf mutants have held their recessive
      characteristics through the T5 generation and exhibit a 50%-60%
      reduction in plant height, when compared with untreated parent
      inbred control corn plants, yet produce full ears of normal size,
      as compared to the controls.<br>
      <br>
      Using this same method and the same soybean root-nodule macerate
      as the donor material, the dwarf traits have been produced in
      treated series from four of the five original inbred varieties.<br>
      <br>
      When T5 generation dwarf plants originating from two different
      treated inbred lines are crossed in a normal manner to produce a
      hybrid, the dwarf characteristics are transferred to the hybrid.
      The resulting hybrid is uniformly about 40% of the height of the
      hybrid resulting from a cross between two untreated, inbred parent
      lines.<br>
      <br>
      The ear size and kernel formation in the dwarf hybrids are about
      the same as in the untreated hybrid controls. The commercial
      significance of this is that a smaller plant size in the dwarf
      hybrid allows a higher plant density under field planting
      conditions, which in turn results in a higher yield per acre.<br>
      <br>
      Lastly, the ears on the dwarf plants are located much lower on the
      plant than on the normal or control hybrids, and thus are more
      efficiently harvested than those on taller control plants.<br>
      <br>
      Additionally, a male sterile, cytoplasmic mutation (Cms) was
      observed in 100% of the plants in one of the transduced, Mo17-Ht
      inbred lines. This mutation is commercially important in the
      development of inbred lines which do not require the laborious
      task of de-tasseling in the normal production of hybrids.<br>
      <br>
      In the T3 generation, a number of plants selected for phenotypic
      growth and yield advantages were used for hybrid crossing studies.
      In general, the early development and high yield traits present in
      the T3 generation plants were transmitted into the hybrids when
      the treated progeny were expressed through the female line of the
      hybrid. An example of this is a soybean root-nodule donor series
      expressing the mutuation "prolific", which relates to the
      percentage of plants with multiple ears. A normal hybrid line has
      about a 10% level of prolific plants. In hybrid crosses, using
      female parents from T2 generation inbreds, a direct correlation
      was observed between the percentage of plants with prolific
      mutations and the resulting yields. The yields from three field
      replications were compared with a good producing commercial
      hybrid. The yield from one of these high producing treated lines
      is compared with the control hybrid in Table VIII below.<br>

      This example illustrates the number and type of mutations which
      can be induced by the methods of the present invention. Many of
      the mutuations have utility in the production of new varieties and
      in the hybridization of plants. The useful mutant characteristics
      are selected from the test populations by conventional segregation
      testing methods commonly employed by plant breeders. The useful
      mutations are also expressed when employed in hybrid crosses.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE SEVEN</b><br>
      <br>
      As noted in Example Six, the Eastern Marsh Cabbage (Symplocarpus
      foetidus) has a high metabolic output during early spring growth,
      the result of which is development of the plant during a period of
      temperatures too low for growth to proceed in most plant species.
      This metabolic response can be imparted to corn (Zea mays) by the
      method of the present invention, when a donor extract from Marsh
      Cabbage is applied to the corn seedlings. Potential benefits of
      such a characteristic might be expressed as higher yields, faster
      development rates or other useful mutations. A new variety with
      some or all of these attributes could be grown in regions of the
      world where the growing season is conventionally believed to be
      too brief for corn development.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE SEVEN(A)</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      A donor medium was prepared from the macerated roots of the Easter
      Marsh Cabbage, and corn seeds were exposed to a direct current
      during initial inbibition with the medium with the apparatus shown
      in, and by the method described in conjunction with, FIG. 8. After
      treatment, the extract-exposed and control series were examined
      under field growth conditions. Table IX discloses growth data
      taken just before mid-maturity (36 days after exposure). Each
      series contained 16 plants. Only the series having a positive base
      plate polarity during exposure of the seeds exhibited a
      statistically significant increase (P less than 0.05) in growth,
      as compared to the controls.<br>
      <br>

      <br>
      The polarity differences shown here are consistent with those
      mentioned in Example Six(A). With the base of the apparatus being
      the positive electrode, the embryo or radicle end of the seed was
      disposed upwardly, in contact with the cathode. This arrangement
      is the one which exhibited a statistically significant increase in
      plant growth. Cathode-radicle exposure was also the optimum
      situation for the plant series reported in Table IV and V. This
      demonstrates the consistency of the electrode orientation in the
      method of the invention.<br>
      <br>
      A detailed field examination of the plants listed in Table IX
      disclosed five unique plants out of each group of 16 treated
      series. Each of these five plants had definite growth enhancement,
      larger and greener foliage, the foliage being more pronounced than
      even the other members in the same test series. The growth of
      these designated "sub-groups" are listed in Table X, again at 36
      days after exposure. The differences in growth between the
      sub-groups and the controls were statistically significant (P less
      than 0.01).<br>

      differences in leaf width between the treated and control series
      are statistically significant (P less than 0.01).<br>

      Development was also more rapid in these sub-group plants. At 82
      days development, both sub-groups disclosed 100% tassel formation,
      whereas in the controls only 37% possessed tassels. The positive
      polarity sub-group also disclosed two developing ears, with no ear
      development at all in the controls.<br>
      <br>
      The final yield results for each entire series of plants is shown
      in Table XII. The ear weights are somewhat lower than normal,
      especially in the control series. This was due to a dry period
      during early ear development, a situation which occurred
      throughout the Midwest in the 1983 growing season. All three
      series were, however, subjected to the same water stress
      conditions. The data in Table XII show the importance of early ear
      development in the two test series which occurred before the water
      stress interval.<br>

      The final ear weights from the two sub-groups of special high
      vigor plants gave values of 134 g per ear for five negative base
      plate polarity plants, and 230 g per ear for the five positive
      base plate polarity plants. The controls averaged only 27.3 g per
      ear. The differences are significant at a 99% confidence level (P
      less than 0.01).<br>
      <br>
      This example demonstrates the induction of a metabolic response
      having a positive effect on both development and yield in corn,
      when the corn seeds are treated in accordance with the method of
      the present invention. It also shows the practical value of
      selecting outstanding plants in a given test series.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE SEVEN(B)</b><br>
      <br>
      A donor medium was prepared in mid-March from the macerated roots
      of the Easter Marsh Cabbage. Corn seedlings were exposed to the
      donor macerate with the apparatus shown in, and in accordance with
      the method described in conjunction with, FIG. 3, and with the
      test conditions described in Example Six(B). The same five inbred
      lines, also as described in Example Six(B), were utilized. After
      exposure the treated and control series of plants were examined
      under field test conditions as outlined in the previous examples.<br>
      <br>
      In the T1 generation, the plant alterations in the treated series
      of plants were expressed as increased development rates, plant
      size and plant shape variations. From these treated series of
      plants, individual plants were selected for T2 to T3 generation
      inbred and hybrid crosses. In the T2 generation, several point
      mutations were observed, and their degree of expression is listed
      in Table XIII, along with the associated allele and chromosome on
      which the mutuation is known to occur. None of these mutuations
      was found in several thousand untreated controls.<br>
      <br>

      <br>
      From this list there are three point mutations of utility in the
      commercial production of hybrids, namely, rust resistance, pigmy
      and male sterile. The pigmy plants are of quite different
      phenotype (narrow leaf and other known characteristics) from the
      dwarf mutants discussed in Example Six(b). However, they could be
      utilized for a similar purpose, to produce smaller sized hybrids
      and provide higher plant densities with higher yields. The utility
      of male sterile plants was discussed in Example Six(B) as well.<br>
      <br>
      In addition to the mutations listed in Table XIII, two important
      phenotypic alterations were observed which continue to be
      expressed into a T5 generation currently under study. One new
      trait involves a line with a maturity which is 12-14 days earlier
      than the untreated controls. The second is a "broad leaf"
      expression with leaf widths on the treated lines over 40% greater
      than those on the untreated controls. The useful nature of the
      broad leaf characteristic lies in the ability of the plant to
      receive and utilize more radiant energy per unit time during
      photosynthetic activity. The result is plant with a more efficient
      and higher biomass output.<br>
      <br>
      A number of treated series from both the early and broad leaf
      lines were used in hybrid crossing studies. These plants were
      selected for either enhanced growth or for altered plant size.
      When the female line was the treated series, a number of
      statistically significant yield increases and early maturing lines
      were observed in the replicated field tests.<br>
      <br>
      This example and previous examples together demonstrate that
      different donor materials produce significantly different
      mutations and phenotypic growth responses, as may be seen by
      comparing the point mutations in Example Six(B) (resulting from
      soybean root nodule donor material) with those in this example,
      employing Symplocarpus foetidus as the donor material. New germ
      plasm is constantly of importance in commercial plant breeding
      programs and Examples Six(B) and Seven(B) illustrate that although
      the advantageous expression of a mutation, such as male sterile,
      may produce similar results, the fact that different alleles are
      involved in the two examples means that the characteristics in the
      germ plasm would be expressed quite differently in hybird usage.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>CONTROLS</b><br>
      <br>
      In order to insure that the results obtained in these examples
      resulted from the combination of subjecting the acceptor species
      plants to electrophoretic conditions and to whole cells and
      associated materials of a second species of plant, controls were
      conducted in which the materials of the second species of plant
      were replaced by distilled water or by a macerate of plants of the
      same species as the first species. Additionally, seedlings of the
      same species had root portions excised and joined together, as
      well as being exposed to an electropotential difference only. In
      all cases, no statistically significant difference was seen
      between any of the plants so treated and untreated control plants.
      Thus, the results obtained in the examples described in this
      application necessarily resulted from the inclusion of a donor
      material from a second, different species of plants.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>DISCUSSION</b><br>
      <br>
      The data obtained in the above examples leads to the inescapable
      conclusion that the frequency of plant mutations can be increased
      by exposing plants in their germinal phase simultaneously to
      electrophoretic conditions and to the whole cells and associated
      materials of a second species of plant. The fat that some of the
      mutated plants obtained possess characteristics which appear to be
      characteristics associated with the donor material of the second
      species of plant suggests that some genetically associated cell
      tissue components or macromolecular complexes from the donor
      species of plant are transferred to or transduced into the intact
      living cells of the acceptor species of plant, in such a manner as
      to alter the genotype and/or phenotype of the acceptor, to
      allowing such altered genetic and phenotypic characteristics be
      transmitted to successive generations as point mutations or as
      cytoplasmic transmitted traits. The subsequent discussion and
      examples supporting such a theory should be taken as evidence of
      the theory; however, the theory of transduction of genetic
      materials is not in and of itself essential to an understanding of
      or a practice of the methods of the present invention. Those
      methods have been demonstrated by the preceeding examples to be
      useful in producing an increased number of mutants in a plant
      population, without regard to whether the instant explanation of
      how such mutations occur is correct. The fact that the mutations
      occur is sufficient support for the invention.<br>
      <br>
      The theory as to how the present invention operates is
      straightforward. It is believed that in the present invention the
      application of electrophoretic conditions to the cells of an
      intact organism or whole plant allows the tranduction of
      genetically associated cell tissue components and macromolecular
      complexes from the donor species material to the recipient plant
      species. Migration of these materials would be induced by
      transmembrane ionophoretic currents, either arising from the
      natural difference in membrane potentials between cells of
      different species, or from an externally applied current. The
      theoretical feasibility of electrophoesis occurring laterally or
      along, but not through, cell membranes, has been discussed by
      Jaffe, Nature, 265: 600-602 (1977), and was demonstrated
      experimentally within the cell membrane and wall by Woodruff and
      Telfer, Nature, 286: 84-86 (1980). However, as opposed to the
      present invention, this ion migration was observed and performed
      by the injection of fluorescent trace-proteins through the cell
      membranes of an insect ooctye, where they were observed to migrate
      laterally along "intercellular bridges" or openings, but was not
      transferred through the membrane barriers without breach of them.
      Quite simply, the advantage of the present invention is the fact
      that it is conducted with normal, intact cells of the acceptor
      species, and at worst with tissue macerates of the donor species.
      The need to breach or remove the cell wall encountered in all
      previous techniques is avoided.<br>
      <br>
      Electrophoresis can alter cell plasmalemma permability. This
      permability is changed by altering the size or current of charge
      carrier proteins and micropores in the plasmalemma and nuclear
      envelope. And, as demonstrated by the subsequent examples, it is
      also clear that the application of electrophoretic conditions
      allows the ready passage of nongenetic materials through the
      normal, intact cell wall. Additionally, routine commercial gel
      electrophoresis techniques demonstrate that some sort of genetic
      alteration is associated with the method of the present invention.
      The transmission of certain enzymes, mRNA or tRNA from the cells
      of the donor plant species to the cytoplasm or nucleoplasm of the
      cells of the acceptor species of plant alter the rate or path of
      one or more specific biosynthetic pathways in the acceptor
      species, which would then alter the phenotype of the cells of the
      plant. A model of such alteration is shown in FIGS. 10A and 10B,
      and is described further below.<br>
      <br>
      An examination of electrophoretic technology as a testing
      procedure was conducted in 20 transduced corn lines and five
      untreated control lines, from which the test lines were derived.
      All lines were from the T4 generation of field testing. Gel
      electrophoresis indicated the presence of 10 transduced lines, or
      50% of the total test group, having altered gene alleles. All five
      inbred controls displayed uniform, unchanged electrophoretic
      patterns. A total of 8 enzymes, out of the 37 known loci in corn,
      were examined and provided confirmatory evidence of polymorphism
      or new gene alleles. In a second test series, 12 enzymes were
      examined. The test group consisted of 42 transduced lines, 21 from
      each; of two different in-bred host or control lines. The material
      from the T4 generation again possessed a high percentage, about 28
      percent, of transduced lines having altered alleles, with
      essentially unaltered or homozygous patterns in the untreated
      control samples.<br>
      <br>
      Applicant has observed that induced dielectrophoretic properties
      or long range dipole interactions of a donor material can
      influence the spatial configuration of organelles within the
      acceptor cells located within the tissue regions of tranduction.
      For example, when donors are employed which have a strong,
      positive dipole charge, that is, a dipole moment much higher than
      that of water, or donors are employed that have been oxidized and
      thus receive a net positive charge, those donors migrate from the
      anode region and pass through the plasmalemma, and associated with
      the cell nucleus, forming a non-uniform electric field having a
      maximum intensity at the nuclear membrane. This results in an
      increase in the frequency of the collection of chloroplasts and
      other cell organelles in distinct proximity with the surface of
      the nucleus. In normal, untreated tissue, the nuclear-organelle
      clustering is observed at a low frequency of perhaps 1%-5% of
      cells, while in transduced tissue, the frequency in limited
      regions around the electrode contract zone is observed to be as
      high as 80%-90% of the cells. Chloroplasts and other organelles
      are clearly attracted to the nuclear membrane by long range dipole
      interactions.<br>
      <br>
      Applicant has also observed that the chloroplasts and organelles
      clustering around the nucleus is not a unique property of one
      specific donor material. For example, other less dipole substances
      such as distilled water, when used as a donor, do not produce the
      nuclear-organelle clustering. In the case of a donor which enters
      the free space (apoplast) of the host tissue and has a marked
      dipole moment, but is inert with respect to passing through the
      plasmalemma, the influence on the spatial patterns of chloroplasts
      is quite different. In such a case the chloroplast and organelle
      clustering around the nucleus is not observed, but rather the
      collection of the donor material in the free space of the cells
      causes a mass migration of the organelles to the cell wall, the
      direction depending upon the charge characteristics of the donor
      material. These changes in configural associations caused by
      electrophoretic conditions greatly increases the probability level
      for the exchange of genetic information between the nuclear and
      cytoplasmic DNA, since the organelles are disposed in proximity
      with the nucleus. The cooperative, long range dipolar effects
      occur inside the cell through the microdielectrophoretic
      interactions between the cell organelles. The existence of such
      dipole interactions has been postulated by Pohl,
      Bioelectrochemistry, Plenem Press, New York (1980). By using a
      ferroelectric material, specifically, barium titanate, Pohl was
      able to demonstrate dipolar attraction on the outside surface of
      animal cells. However, as far as the Applicant is aware, the
      instant observations are the first time that
      microdielectrophoresis has been observed inside living cells.<br>
      <br>
      Applicant believes the following mechanism may be an appropriate
      explanation for the observed migratory phenomenon. It is well
      known that the plant cell wall contains polysaccharides which act
      as growth and development regulators and chemical messengers. As
      noted by Albershime and Darvill, Scientific American, September,
      1985, page 58, these regulatory molecules are released from the
      cell wall by enzymes. Different enzymes release different
      oligosaccharides (small polysaccharides). In a transduction from a
      new donor species, a donor enzyme complex enters the cell wall
      matrix and triggers the release of a quite different array of
      oligosaccharides which, after entering the cytoplasm, redirect
      patterns of development and form different genotypic associations
      with either the cell nucleus or the cytoplasmic organelles. As
      microdielectrophoresis takes place as described above, both
      nuclear and cytoplasmic interactions occur. This redirection of
      growth regulators from the cell walls could not occur in the
      recombinant DNA or protoplast fusion technologies, since the cell
      wall is necessarily removed in the early stages of the techniques.
      Further, the enzymes of one plant species may act as isoenzymes of
      the second plant species and possibly alter the morphogenic
      properties of the cell. Indeed, there may be enough of a potential
      difference between the cells of a difference species to facilitate
      the formation of intercellular cytoplasmic bridges which may allow
      certain cytoplasmic extranuclear DNA or cell organelles to be
      transferred from one species of plant to another. The transferred
      cytoplasmic extranuclear DNA and organelle systems would also
      exert some influence over the morphogenic determinative
      components, thereby transforming the phenotype of the tissues.<br>
      <br>
      Additionally, phygocytosis may occur and invaginate certain cell
      organelles through the cell plasmalemma and into the cytoplasm.
      Because the cell organelles and cytoplasmic extranuclear DNA
      synthesize at least some proteins and other materials, which are
      vital to cell function, the addition of cytoplasmic extranuclear
      DNA and cell organelles from a different species of pant may cause
      the creation of enzymes and proteins which are similar enough to
      the transformed cells' natural products to be utilized by the
      transformed cell but may, in the process, act as isoenzymes and
      "isoproteins" which cause the plant to exhibit different
      phenotypic characteristics, which may then be transmitted to
      successive generations in a non-Mendelian fashion. For example, in
      the technique described in conjunction with FIG. 3, the maceration
      of the donor tissue in distilled water liberates proteins and
      enzymes inside the cytoplasm of the donor cells, and this can
      facilitate the transfer of these constituents, because such
      constituents need pass only from the medium through the cell wall
      and plasmalemma of the host into the cytoplasm, rather than having
      to pass through at least two whole cell walls and plasmalemma, as
      would be the case for non-macerated donors.<br>
      <br>
      The procedures of this invention are believed to involve
      transductions within the somatic tissues of the host material. The
      complete expression of a new mutation or phenotypic alteration is
      not usually observed until at least the T2 generation. For this
      reason any explanation of what takes place in the host plant after
      the application of any of the described procedures cannot be based
      on the concept of a direct, abrupt uptake of donor DNA into the
      host plant cells during the initial transduction process. The
      establishing of a fixed genetic expression arising from a
      transduction appears to be a very gradual process and is believed
      to occur in a series of stages during the entire cycle of plant
      development.<br>
      <br>
      For the gradual incorporation of a new genotypic or phenotypic
      expression into the host plant, the transductions are assumed to
      be operating within specific biofeedback control systems involved
      in the plant morphogenesis. To convey this proposed concept of
      perturbations induced by the genetic transduction process, the
      least complex of known homeostasis pathways is adopted as a model,
      B. C. Goodwin, Temporal Organization in Cells, Academic Press, New
      York (1963). In this simple pathway the alteration takes place at
      a single active gener locus G@0, which mormally leads to the
      synthesis of a cellular metabolite m@0 (or enzyme according to the
      scheme shown in FIG. 10A. In this model, m@0 acts as a repressor
      or co-repressor at the gene site G@0 through the feedback loop.
      The main concern here is with the control of protein (enyzme)
      synthesis Y@0, which regulates the final production of the
      cellular metabolite.<br>
      <br>
      The assumption is made that the level of the metabolite m@0 is
      perturbed by the introduction into the cell of a homologous
      metabolite from a different plant species by means of the
      transduction process. This new metabolite m@x acts at the cellular
      locus and augments the concentration of m@0 so that the new level
      is at the concentration m@1 (FIG. 10B) after the transduction is
      completed. The rate at which the effect of the transduction m@x is
      annulled is, for a small perturbation, proportional to the
      magnitude of the disturbance. From first order chemical kinetics,
      the level as a function of time t after the transduction is<br>
      m@x =a(e@-kt)<br>
      <br>
      where a and k are constants. A very important point here is that
      m@0 and m@x must be homologous proteins and very similar in their
      biosynthetic activity in both the donor and host plant systems. if
      this were not the case, the control loop m@0 and repressor level
      would be unaffected, or in the case of an incompatible metabolite,
      the entire loop could be inactivated. This could readily explain
      shy some species are effective as donors and others are not, and
      why different tissue regions of the same species respond different
      as donors.<br>
      <br>
      The perturbation of the normal metabolite concentrations m@0 to a
      new level m@x would, through the feedback control, alter the rate
      of mRNA synthesis at the gene site G@0, and a new rate of
      metabolite production would be established in the tissue of the
      host plant. As the somatic tissues develop, the entire pattern of
      gene expression during plant morphogenesis is operating at a
      different level of temporal organization of nucleotides than would
      be found in the non-transduced system. As this perturbed,
      transduced tissue differentiates into meristem regions and
      ultimately into germ plasm, the kinetics of these altered
      biosynthetic pathways are transcribed as altered gene alleles,
      with permanent expression being established in the DNA code.
      During transcription, the mRNA would contain altered codon sites,
      which in turn would lead to altered protein synthesis as the
      polypeptide chains are synthesized on the ribosome surface. Thus
      we have the situation of the induction of new enzymes synthesized
      in the epigenetic cycle or enzymatic adaption through the
      introduction of homologue precursors from another plant species
      (the donor).<br>
      <br>
      The perturbations of biofeedback control mechanisms within more
      complex co-repressor systems could account for incomplete or
      partial masking of dominant alleles in the somatic tissue. In the
      situation where cytoplasmic mutations arise form the
      transductions, the inherited alterations may be brought about in
      quite a different manner. In this case the presence of foreign
      polypeptides from the donor leads to the possibility that such
      polypeptides become genetic precursors and may be subsequently
      imported into chloroplasts and mitochondria, A. Cashmore et al.,
      Biotechnology, 3: 803-808, (1895). The plant genome is unstable
      and capable of generating variability, Science, 224: 1415, due to
      changes in repeated DNA units which are more common in plants than
      animals (more than 75% of all DNA sequences fifty base pairs or
      longer is repetitive DNA). Repeated sequences are especially prone
      to undergo loss or gain because they can promote the incorrect
      pairing of chromosomes during meiosis. If there are multiple
      copies of a gene, one copy may be mutated and lead to a new
      function, as in the above transduction scheme, while the previous
      function is maintained by the remaining members or copies of the
      gene. Such copies have the characteristics of transposable
      elements, B. Mc Clintock, Science, 226: 946, with the result that
      some specialized cells undergo gene activation and phenotype
      changes. Only DNA loss is irreversible, other DNA alterations such
      as methylation, chromatin structure, protein-DNA interactions and
      the like being reversible and modifiable. The mechanisms for all
      embodiments of this invention are thought to be similar to the
      above recited model.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, under the application of an electric current across tissues
      from two different species of plants, transmembrane ion migration
      occurs, with specific enzymes, their precursors mRNA and tRNA, and
      regulatory polysaccharides being transmitted from a donor species
      into the cytoplasm of an acceptor species. Current flow across the
      tissues also effects the electric charges on the cell membranes
      and greatly alters membrane permeability and ion pathways through
      the intrinsic proteins within the cell membrane, which control the
      transfer of ions and large molecules. With in the cell,
      microdielectrophoresis alters spatial configurations of the
      organells, resulting in increased probabilities for the transfer
      of genetic information between the organells and thereby causing
      increased rates of mutation. The following examples demonstrate
      the ready degree of ion migration occuring in cells and germinal
      plants upon the application of electrophoretic conditions.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE VIII</b><br>
      <br>
      To elucidate the mechanisms occuring at the cellular level, donors
      were utilized with known ionic charge characteristics and with
      both inert and biologically active properties. One type of host
      tissue consisted of the chlorophyll containing stems of
      Pelargonium maculatum. Stems about 5 centimeters long and 5 to 8
      millimeters in diameter were subjected to two to four hours at
      about 10 to 20 volt potentials and a current density of about 30
      microamperes per square centimeter. The negatively charged, red
      protein pigment from the Amaranth plant was applied as a donor
      material in the apparatus disclosed in and according to the
      technique described in conjunction with FIG. 8, with each end of
      the host stem contacting a pigment-containing electrode. At the
      cathode end of the test stem the red pigment migrated through the
      section, leaving a zone of stained tissue extending several
      millimeters into the stem. At the boundary of this zone of
      migration, a microscopic examination revealed the stain collecting
      of the nucleus of the parenchyma cells. At the anode end of the
      test stem, the pigment was oxidized and because positively
      charged. As it migrated from the anode end of the stem it gave the
      host tissue a dark grey color zone extending several millimeters
      into the stem. At the boundary of this zone, a microscopic
      examination revealed a clustering or proximal grouping of
      chloroplasts in the immediate vicinity of the cell nucleus. The
      oxidized Amaranth was observed to collect on the nucleus, and
      through long range dipole intractions (microdielectrophoresis)
      formed a positive electrical field gradient which then attracted
      the negatively charged chloroplasts to the surface of the nucleus
      at the locations of maximum field strength.<br>
      <br>
      Confirmation of these dielectrophoretic alterations in spatial
      configurations of cell organelles was observed when using a
      powdered form of carbonyl iron having a particle size of one to 10
      microns, with a positive electric charge. When transduced into
      geranium stems, as in the preceeding example, an electrophoretic
      migration of 1 to 2 centimeters occured at the anode end of the
      stem. Carbonyl iron is biochemically active and was observed to be
      transduced into the cell cytoplasm where, as in the case with the
      oxidized Amaranth pigment, it caused a long range dipolar
      attraction of the chloroplasts in the cytoplasm. The chloroplasts
      were found to be more tightly grouped around the cell nucleus than
      in the case with the cell Amaranth donor. This is explained by the
      fact that within the same host tissue and under the same
      conditions of voltage and time, when compared with the Amaranth,
      the carbonyl iron migrates over two times the distance into the
      host tissue. This indicates that the carbonyl iron has a higher
      ionic mobility than the Amaranth pigment.<br>
      <br>
      A donor macerate of Phaseolus multiflora leaves containing
      macromolocules and proteins with associated charge groups, when
      electrophoretically transduced into the non-chlorophyll tissue of
      Zea mays radicles using the same method as above, causes a
      clustering of cellular plastids and other cell organelles (too
      minute to identify microscopically) around the cell nuclei in the
      anode region of the host tissue. At the cathode region the cell
      nuclei had a smooth outline and the chromatin structure was
      uniform. Other less ionic donor substances such as distilled
      water, when transduced in a similar manner, with the host tissue
      being either the geranium stem tissue or the non-chloroplast
      radicle tissue of corn, did not induce the observed spatial
      readjustments in the cell organelles.<br>
      <br>
      Barium ferrite of particle size 1.3 microns and having a net
      negative charge was then used as a donor for the purpose of
      examining a biochemically inert substance which enters only the
      free space (apoplast) of the host tissue. Using the geranium stem
      as the acceptor and employing exposures as in the preceeding
      example, the extent of the migration was far less than when using
      the more biochemically active materials. The dark stained tissue
      region was only two to three millimeters into the cathode end of
      the stem section. At the boundary of the migration, the donor
      particles cause the negatively charged chloroplasts to migrate and
      cluster at the cell wall opposite the location of the cathode and
      migrating barium ferrite. The grouping here was of an entirely
      different spatial patterning then when using donors which enter
      the cytoplasm of the cell of the host tissue.<br>
      <br>
      This example serves to teach that in the process of
      electrophoretic transduction as described in this invention, the
      donor complex can migrate both through the cell free space of the
      host tissue, as well as through the plasma membrane into the
      cytoplasm of the cell. Furthermore, the nature and ionic strength
      of the molecular dipole charges of the donor can significantly
      alter the natural, more or less random, spatial distribution of
      cell organelles in the cells of tissues being electrophoretically
      transduced. Such altered spatial patterns can greatly influence
      the probability of the exchange of genetic information between the
      cell nucleus and surrounding organelles, and thus provide one
      mechanism whereby mutation rates can be significantly increased.
      This example also teaches that both organic and inorganic
      molecular species can enter the plant cell and interact with the
      organelles in a physical and/or biochemical manner. Components
      from a macromolecular donor complex produced from plant tissue,
      also enter the cell and are active in the organelle spatial
      repatterning.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE NINE</b><br>
      <br>
      Dry seeds of corn (Zea mays) were inserted between the stainless
      steel electrodes of the apparatus illustrated in FIG. 8. The
      electrodes were covered with filter paper pads moistened with
      distilled water. The embroyo end of the seed was placed upward, or
      opposite the base plate electrode. At a 45 volt direct current
      potential a sharp, well defined uniform line of black pigment was
      observed to develop and migrate up the seed if the base plate was
      anodic or positive, or down the seed if the base plate was
      cathodic or negative.<br>
      <br>
      Since distilled water has a very low ionic content, charge
      transport in the seed occurred through the oxidation of the
      pigment materials (polyphenols) in the test seed. The migration of
      these oxidation products, as testing indicates, is linear with
      time. This linear relationship is what would be expected under
      conditions of electrophoretic migration. An ionic mobility of
      about 0.54.times.10@-6 centimeters squared per volt per second was
      observed, a value which is consistent with the rate of movement of
      large molecules. Microscopic examination revealed the layer of
      oxidation products to extend laterally through the tests into the
      outer layers of the endosperm.<br>
      <br>
      This example provides a graphic demonstration of the movement of
      large, physiologically related molecules through the plant tissues
      under conditions of an electrical potential as applied in the
      methods of the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE TEN</b><br>
      <br>
      The frequencies of altered enzyme loci producing polymorphism in
      corn plants in which Sympolocarpus feotidus is the donor are quite
      different from the frequencies when using the soybean root-nodule
      extract as the donor. These different allelic responses are
      exemplified by commercial electrophoresis tests. In 62 transduced
      lines produced in accordance with the method described in
      conjunction with FIG. 3, 15 lines were transduced with
      Symplocarpus feotidus as the donor, and 47 lines with the soybean
      root-nodule as the donor. Table XIV provides a listing of the
      number of transduced lines containing a specific enzyme polymorph,
      as they occurred within the two donor test groups. Only those
      alleles showing positive polymorphism are included in this
      listing; those observed to have only a slight variation are
      excluded. The enzymes listed are those in which polymorphism
      occurred in at least one transduced line.<br>

      <br>
      The data in Table XIV demonstrates that in the soybean root-nodule
      lines the majority of the alterations take place at the ACP
      alleles. In the lines with S. foetidus as the donor, there were
      fewer lines with altered ACP alleles and far more lines involving
      other enzymes. The fact that the two enzymes, PGD and GLU revealed
      polymorphism in the S. foetidus lines (comprising only 24% of the
      total test series) and not in the root-nodule lines (comprising
      76% of the test series) again emphasizes the influence of the
      donor type on the final genetic response and range of possible
      polymorphic alterations that might be achieved by using other
      donor types and combinations.<br>

      Whatever the mechanism yielding the mutations observed when the
      methods of the present invention are employed, the present
      invention clearly provides methods for increasing the proportion
      of mutants in plant generations. The method of the present
      invention are significantly advantageous over the known methods of
      recombinant DNA and plasmid fusion techniques, for the reasons
      that the precise genetic structure of the chromosomes mutated need
      not be elucidated, time and effort need not be wasted in removing
      the cell walls, and time and effort need not be wasted in
      attempting to grow whole plants from isolated tissues. Instead,
      the acceptor plants are whole germinal plants, which after
      treatment can be grown in any conventional fashion.<br>
      <br>
      Having described my invention, however, many modifications thereto
      will become apparent to those skilled in the area to which it
      pertains, without deviation from the spirit of the present
      invention, as defined by the scope of the appended claims.<br>

      <br>
      In vivo investigations of bioelectric currents associated with
      growth, tissue metabolism, and water responses in the stems of
      trees and herbaceous plants are described. This experimentation is
      based on a new technique which allows the continuous monitoring of
      variations in bioelectric currents related to intertissue redox
      conditions. Exploratory studies indicate relationships between
      variations in the redox current and turgor conditions in plants. A
      correlation between the bioelectric current and the difference in
      oxidation potentials between the plant and ground electrodes is
      discussed.<br>
      <br>
      In field studies, the current was monitored in different species
      of trees over a 1-year interval. Similarities in current
      variations occurred in similar species of trees and were examined
      in relation to temperature, rainfall, and phenological factors.
      The current level, examined in trees as a function of radial
      depth, disclosed the maximum output in the cambium layer. In a
      study of diurnal variations, a temporal shift in a current maximum
      was noted along the tree bole.<br>
