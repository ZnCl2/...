      <hr width="100%" size="2">
      <p> In writing this very short account of the oscillating theory
        of the Moray "Radiant Energy" discoveries, one can only touch
        the high spots as many large books would have to be written to
        even in a small way cover the subject. </p>
      <p>All who may read this may not understand me, as I may fail to
        explain myself as fully as I might desire. There have been truly
        great men who were unable to express themselves so that men of
        their time understood their inner meaning. Franklin, Faraday,
        Cavendish and others gave to the world, their ideas in a form
        unintelligible to many learned ones of their day, yet their
        theories have since become known facts. It is hard to rid
        ourselves of inherited ideas which so completely, although
        perhaps unconsciously control our line of thought. Another
        difficulty which has hindered man in forming a true picture of
        the objective world is that mixed blessing — egotism. In early
        centuries he could not escape from the false assumption of his
        own preeminent importance, and these same shackles are still
        prejudicing the observations of most persons. </p>
      <p>In reference to electrons, protons, and ions: It is my theory
        in using these terms that they are portions of ether, that by
        some unknown means have become dissociated here and there and
        become electrically charged, and these innumerable infinitesimal
        particles of electrified ether constitute (by the forces they
        exert and the disturbances they originate) the substratum of
        what our senses term as matter. </p>
      <p>Matter is susceptible to motion. Ether is susceptible to
        stress. All energy appertains either to matter or ether, and
        continually passes from one to the other, thus producing kinetic
        energy. There at its very foundation matter consists of
        electrical charges which governs the very motion of celestial
        bodies. </p>
      <p>There are ample writings acknowledging that there is unlimited
        energy in the Universe but to say one is able to tap this supply
        is another matter. If I tell you there is water, good cold
        water, in a glass on your table, but you cannot drink it for a
        million years, what would you think? You know how to get the
        water out of a glass. Well, it is as easy to tap this energy now
        out in space as it will be a million years from now. If it can
        be done then, it can be done now. An electric generator pumps it
        out of the great store house. Why not syphon it? </p>
      <p>For me to go into a technical account of how to syphon, would
        mean the writing of volumes. The whole thing might be said in
        the few words of Nikola Tesla: "Throughout space there is
        energy. Is this energy static or kinetic? If static our hopes
        are in vain: if kinetic and this we know it is for certain, then
        it is a mere question of time when men will succeed in attaching
        their machinery to the very wheelwork of nature." </p>
      <p>This I have been able to do through the use of certain
        oscillators that I have made and of which doctors of science
        have said are the most powerful devices known to science today.
        With the use of these oscillators and the oscillating effect of
        condensers which I have sometimes explained in the following way
        to those who are not acquainted with the back-rush effect of
        condensers, and which may serve to make my point now. When an
        elastic substance is subjected to strain and then set free, one
        of two things happens. The substance may slowly recover from the
        strain and gradually attain its natural state, or the elastic
        recoil may carry it past its position of equilibrium and cause
        it to execute a series of oscillations. Something of the same
        sort may also occur when an electrified condenser is discharged.
        In ordinary language there may be a continous flow of
        electricity in one direction until the discharge is completed,
        or if proper use of the condensers are made an oscillating
        discharge may occur. That is, the first flow may be succeeded by
        a back-rush, as if the first discharge had over run itself and
        something like a recoil set in. The condensers thus become more
        or less charged again in the opposite sense, and a second
        discharge occurs accompanied by a second back-rush, the
        oscillations going on until the energy is either radiated or
        used up in the heating of the conductors. And if your device
        will oscillate in harmony with the oscillations of the Universe,
        or in other words, if the device is capable to synchronization
        with the vibrations of that energy through space then the
        oscillations will go on forever. No one can call such an
        arrangement perpetual motion any more than one can call the
        motion of the earth perpetual motion. My device oscillates
        because of the oscillations of the Universe. </p>
      <p>For those who do not happen to agree with me on the back-rush
        effect of condensers I will go into the matter in detail later
        in this booklet, although in so doing will repeat some of the
        matter given here. I cannot give a technical account of my
        device without disclosing too much, but it has been pronounced
        as scientifically, electrically and mechanically sound and
        correct by noted men of science, and the device will do all that
        has been claimed. I can use it on any home with the regular
        system of wiring. No change of wiring being necessary. </p>
      <p>It might not be out of place to now give a few notes taken from
        my diary of the year 1918, but first I will add that in
        explaining this theory to a well known and noted American
        scientist, he said, "You go in your theory back of the law of
        gravitation." </p>
      <p>We may readily take it for granted that a perpetual light, like
        perpetual motion, is an impossibility. I say that because I do
        not believe in perpetual light or motion, which, in a sense, is
        one and the same thing as getting something for nothing. </p>
      <p>In this day and age it is not well to say anything is
        impossible, but getting something for nothing goes beyond my
        conception of thought. What I have done in my work has been and
        perhaps rightfully called "radical." Nevertheless, of the great
        number of learned men who have seen and heard of my work, not
        one has been able to disprove my claims, theories or
        discoveries. Among those in question have been some of America's
        foremost in science, although they have spent hours, even days
        on my theory and claims. Hence this further explanation of the
        Moray theory, on which Moray has spent his time from boyhood. </p>
      <p>Extracts from the notes follow, although they may in a way
        repeat what has already been given, but are repeated in order
        not to break the line of thought. </p>
      <p>I fully realize that whatever the difficulties in discovering
        new truths, there are still greater difficulties in getting them
        recognized, for as Mark Twain said, "it takes twenty years to
        get a new idea fixed in the human mind," and I should be armed
        with scant philosophy if I remained for long surprised at the
        attacks of some, or the exasperation of a certain number of
        worthy people, and at the silence of the greater number of
        scholars, who have heard of my experiments. </p>
      <p>The theories herein contained are not new in the main, nor are
        they contrary to ideas that science has accepted today. They
        are, however, original with me in their practical adoption, and
        when 1 first advanced them years ago they were "killed," as it
        were, by those who heard them before they got very far. Be that
        as it may, I have taken energy from space and found a means of
        using it. Heat, light, etc., are not things in themselves, but
        sensations or effects produced by this mysterious energy
        directly or indirectly. </p>
      <p>Electricity is vibrations of radiation. Where ether (or if you
        do not like that name "ether" call it what you will) is
        quiescent, we see nothing. Light causes vibrations of this
        "ether" and it is these vibrations which cause our eyes to
        detect. All substances are really combinations of one primordial
        substance, i. e., electricity, or, in other words, electricity
        is specifically modified ether. Electrons in motion go to
        constitute an electric current. Ether waves in motion go to
        constitute an electric current. What electricity is to matter,
        so is electric force to common mechanical force, and electrical
        inertia to common inertia — I mean the ratio of force to
        acceleration. Perhaps electric inertia might be defined as the
        ratio of electric motive force to the acceleration of electric
        displacement. </p>
      <p>Could it be that ionic charges in a concentrated and an
        individual form are performing vibratory excursions, propelled
        by some great generator out there in space, this great generator
        being the reservoir of colossal energy, sending out vibrations
        of electrical energy in every direction? These vibrations being
        picked up by another planet or star, or call it what you will.
        We will call it "B," referring to the great generator as "A."
        "B" in turn acting as both a receiver and retransmitter of these
        rays of energy to another body, star or planet, which we will
        call "C." This "C" we will refer to as the distribution point to
        other worlds, suns and stars of this Universe or group to which
        our world belongs, it being this energy generated from "A,"
        directed to "C" by "B" that gives energy to our sun and makes
        our own earth rotate and move in its orbit with other bodies of
        our group. </p>
      <p>The suns, in and of themselves, have no power or energy, being
        nothing more than what the electrodes are to the arc lamp
        without the power from the generator. These waves of energy
        coming from "A" I have proven have a regular beat note of time,
        coming and going as the waves of the sea, but in a very definite
        mathematical order of time, coming to the earth from every
        direction, stronger in the day time than at night, but always
        coming with a regular beat note that might be referred to as the
        Father of Time, the Sire of Gravitation. </p>
      <p>This energy has a definite elastic rigidity and density, which
        is subject to displacement and strains. When the strain is
        removed, this medium will spring back to its old position and
        beyond, surging back and forth as the waves of the sea, and will
        continue to oscillate until the original pressure is used up. If
        the internal impedence is too great, there will be no
        oscillations, but it will merely slide back in a dead beat to
        its unrestrained state. By cutting down the resistance to the
        minimum and by synchronous actions of a device with the actions
        of the Great Generator of the Universe, recovery will be quicker
        and quicker until inertia will assert itself and lengthen out
        the time of final recovery by carrying the recoil beyond the
        natural oscillation and thus prolonging the vibrations by
        oscillation. When the recovery is distinctly oscillatory and
        harmonics set in the oscillations will go on forever because of
        the potential obtained from the Great Generator. As I said,
        these electric oscillations are not simple oscillations, but
        surgings with a definite beat note, the surgings being of a very
        high frequency, and if we knew of a speed greater than that of
        light, I would say their speed exceeds that of light (based on
        186,000 miles per second). </p>
      <p>Now, one will ask, how can you get a steady light from such
        surgings having so great an amount of energy at such a terrific
        potential? Could not a steady flow of water be obtained from the
        surgings of the sea? </p>
      <p>Electricity in its primitive form or natural state is deprived
        of all affinity. </p>
      <p>We speak of generating electricity: To be exact, we only
        transfer it from one place to another (pump it, if you please).
        We cannot generate it because we can neither create nor destroy
        it. After we have used it to light our homes or do other work,
        it is like water over the wheel — no less water, only the
        lowering of potential. The electricity has only sunk back from
        whence it came, ready and waiting for nature or man to raise its
        potential, when it again is ready to do man's bidding, or in
        other words in the evolution of energy it gradually sinks back
        into the ether from which it came as it is naturally very slowly
        but steadily being liberated from the ether. Man may by proper
        means make the process of liberation rapid rather than the
        natural slow way of nature. </p>
      <p>I fully realize elements maintain an equilibrium by rotations,
        attractions and repulsions but this does not interfere with a
        transformation of equilibrium, which when the transformations of
        equilibrium are rapid enough become heat, light and electricity.
      </p>
      <p>There can be no production of current electricity without an
        interruption of equilibrium. Whatever the quantity of
        electricity it will produce no energy if there is no disturbance
        of equilibrium, that is to say change of potential or electrical
        level. </p>
      <p>When one thinks of the oxygen and nitrogen molecules of the air
        all about us are moving with the speed of bullets and striking
        us and every thing with this speed one can form some idea of the
        agitation taking place in the ether. The oscillations of the
        Universe are a part of this acitation. </p>
      <p>These oscillations of these electrons, protons, etc., out there
        in space are emitting electro magnetic waves of many wave
        lengths and frequencies. All I have been able to use have been
        in their unchanged state of very short wave length, and of a
        very high frequency. In the Moray device we have one frequency
        on the high voltage or primary side, and for commercial purposes
        the device is so constructed that the frequency is very much
        lower on the secondary side. </p>
      <p>I will now go on the account promised above on the back-rush
        effect of condensers and electromagnetic radiation. </p>
      <p>But first let me state that all radiant energy is now believed
        to possess mass or something equivalent to it. Mass and radiant
        energy are even considered to be interchangeable. </p>
      <p>And in my attempts to measure the wave length of the current
        obtained the diffraction gratings which are used to determine
        wave length of other radiations were of no use. </p>
      <p>This booklet is getting too long so I must close with the
        account promised above. </p>

        <p><b>Electromagnetic Radiation</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>Ether demanded by Electric Phenomena — an Electric Charge a
        Charge of Energy and an Electric Current a Flow of Energy: To
        account for the propagagtion of heat and light — that is, of
        radiant energy — we have postulated the existance of a medium
        filling all space. But the transference of the energy of radiant
        heat and light is not the only evidence we have in favor of the
        existence of an ether. Electric, magnetic, and electromagnetic
        phenomena (and gravitation itself) point in the same direction.
      </p>
      <p>It is a matter of common observation that attractions and
        repulsions take place between electrified bodies, magnets, and
        circuits conveying electric currents. Large masses may be set in
        motion in this manner and acquire kinetic energy. If an electric
        current be started in any circuit, corresponding induced
        currents spring up in all neighboring conductors; yet there is
        no visible connection between the circuit and the conductors. To
        originate a current in any conductor requires the expenditure of
        energy. How then is the energy propagated from the circuit to
        the conductors? If we believe in the continuity of the
        propagation of energy — that is, if we believe that when it
        disappears at one place and reappears at another, it must have
        passed through the intervening space, and therefore have existed
        there somehow in the meantime — we are forced to postulate a
        vehicle for its conveyance from place to place, and the vehicle
        is the ether. </p>
      <p>When a body is electrified, what we must first observe is that
        a certain amount of energy has been spent; work has been done,
        and the result is the electrified state of the body. The process
        of electrifying a conductor is therefore the storing of energy
        in some way in, or around, the conductor in some medium (the
        ether). The work is spent in altering the state of the medium,
        and when the body is discharged the ether returns to its
        original state, and the store of energy is envolved. Similarly a
        supply of energy is required to maintain an electric current,
        and the phenomena arising from the current are manifestations of
        the presence of this energy in the ether around the circuit.
        Formerly an electrified body was supposed to have something
        called electricity residing upon it which caused the electrical
        phenomena, and an electric current was regarded as a flow of
        electricity travelling along the wire, while the energy which
        appeared at any part of the circuit (if considered at all) was
        supposed to have been conveyed along the wire by the current.
        The existance of induction, however, and electromagnetic actions
        between bodies situated at a distance from each other, lead us
        to look upon the medium around the conductors as playing a very
        important part in the development of the phenomena. It is, in
        fact, the storehouse of the energy. </p>
      <p>Upon this basis Maxwell founded his theory of electricity and
        magnetism, and determined the distribution of the energy in the
        various parts of the field in terms of the electric and magnetic
        forces. The ether around an electrified body is charged with
        energy, and the electrical phenomena are manifestations of this
        energy, and not of an imaginary electric fluid distributed over
        the conductor. When we speak of the charge of an electrified
        conductor we refer to the charge of energy in the ether around
        it, and when we talk of the electric flow or current in a
        circuit we refer to the only flow we know of, viz., the flow of
        energy through the electric field into the wire. </p>
      <p>Polarisation of the Ether — Electric Waves: The work spent in
        producing the electricification of a conductor is spent on the
        ether and stored there, probably as energy of motion. To denote
        this we shall say that the ether around the conductor is
        polarised, this word being employed to denote that its state or
        some of its properties have been altered in some manner by the
        work done on it — that is, by the energy stored in it. In the
        case of a conductor possessing what is termed a positive charge,
        the ether around it is polarised in a certain manner and to a
        certain extent depending on the intensity of the charge. If the
        charge be negative the polarisation is in the opposite sense,
        the two being related, perhaps, like right-handed and
        left-handed twists or rotations. </p>
      <p>Now consider the case of a body charged alternately, positively
        and negatively, in rapid succession. The positive charge means a
        positive polarisation of the ether, which begins at the
        conductor and travels out through space. When the body is
        discharged the ether is once more set free and resumes its
        former condition. The negative charge now entails a modification
        of the ether or polarisation in the opposite sense. The result
        of alternate charges of opposite sign is that the ether at any
        point becomes polarised alternately in opposite directions while
        waves of opposite polarisations are propagated through space,
        each carrying energy derived from 'the source or agent supplying
        the electrification. Here, then, we have a periodic disturbance
        of some kind occurring at each point, accompanied by waves of
        energy travelling outwards from the conductor. </p>
      <p>The phenomena of interference lead to the conclusion that light
        is the result of a periodic disturbance, or vibration, of the
        ether, but as to the nature of the vibiration — that is, as to
        the exact nature of the periodic change — or what it is that
        changes, we possess no knowledge. From the foregoing we see that
        alternating electric charges are accompanied by corresponding
        changes of state, or vibrations of the ether, and if the charge
        be varied periodically and with sufficient rapidity, we have a
        vibration at each point analogous to, and perhaps indentical
        with, that which occurs in the propagation of light. </p>
      <p>This, then, is the electromagnetic theory of the luminous
        vibration. In the older or elastic-solid theory, the light
        vibrations were supposed to be actual oscillation of the
        elements of molecules of the ether about their positions of
        rest, such as takes place when waves of transverse disturbance
        are propagated through an elastic solid. Such a limitation is,
        however, unwarranted. All we know is that the change,
        disturbance, vibration, polarization, or whatever we wish to
        term it, is periodic and transverse to the direction of
        propagation. The electromagnetic theiry teaches us nothing
        further as to its nature, but rather asserts that whatever the
        change may be, it is the same in kind as that which occurs in
        the ether when the charge of an electrified body is altered or
        reversed. It reduces light and heat waves to the same category
        as waves of electric polarization; the only quality of the
        latter required to constitute the former is sufficient rapidity
        of alternation. These speculations have received the strongest
        confirmation by the important experiments of Professor Hertz.
        Before describing them we shall consider the mode of discharge
        of a condenser. The theoretical investigation was given by Sir
        William Thomson (Lord Kelvin) as early as 1853 (Phil. Mag. June,
        1853). </p>
      <p><i>Oscillating Discharge</i>: When any elastic substance is
        subject to strain and then set free, one of two things may
        happen. The substance may slowly recover from the strain and
        gradually attain its natural state, or the elastic recoil may
        carry it past its position of equilibrium, and cause it to
        execute a series of oscillations. Something of the same sort may
        also occur when an electrified condenser such as a Leyden jar is
        discharged. In ordinary language there may be a continuous flow
        of electricity in one direction till the discharge is completed,
        or an oscillating discharge may occur — that is, the first flow
        may be succeeded by a back-rush, as if the first discharge had
        overrun itself and something like recoil had set in. The jar
        thus becomes more or less charged again in the opposite sense,
        and a second discharge occurs, accompanied by a second
        back-rush, the oscillation going on till all the energy is
        either radiated or used up in heating the conductors. </p>
      <p>Let Q be the charge of the jar at any instant, C its capacity,
        R the resistance of the circuit, and L its coefficient of
        self-induction. Then if I be the intensity of the current and E
        the electromotive force, we have the equation — <br>
        <img src="image81m.jpg" width="193" height="50">, <br>
        In this case&nbsp;<img src="imagec5b.jpg" width="58" height="50">
        , and&nbsp;<img src="image84f.jpg" width="77" height="50">.
        Therefore <br>
        <img src="imagen2b.jpg" width="184" height="53">. </p>
      <p>The solution to this equation is <br>
        <img src="imagemrm.jpg" width="129" height="29"> , <br>
        where u end u' are the roots of the equation <br>
        <img src="imageelt.jpg" width="148" height="50">, <br>
        or <br>
        <img src="imageso8.jpg" width="189" height="58"> . <br>
        Writing <br>
        <img src="imageo9r.jpg" width="131" height="58">, <br>
        so have <br>
        <img src="image4op.jpg" width="225" height="50"><br>
        and <br>
        <img src="imageitf.jpg" width="182" height="44"> , <br>
        where A and B are constants determined by the initial
        conditions, viz. that initially we have Q = Q<sub>0</sub>, and I
        = 0, which give <br>
        <img src="image424.jpg" width="90" height="27"> , and&nbsp;<img
          src="imageoe6.jpg" width="102" height="21"> , <br>
        or <br>
        <img src="imagetm6.jpg" width="140" height="50"> , and&nbsp;<img
          src="imagekq9.jpg" width="140" height="50"> . <br>
        Hence at any time we have <br>
        <img src="imageofg.jpg" width="338" height="58"> . <br>
        Consequently the current at any instant is <br>
        <img src="imaged21.jpg" width="250" height="55"> . <br>
        Hence if <u>a</u> be real — that is, if we have&nbsp;<img
          src="image38l.jpg" width="74" height="50">&nbsp; --- the
        quantity Q will&nbsp; gradually diminish to zero as the time
        increases. <br>
        If, however, we have&nbsp;<img src="imageq9m.jpg" width="74"
          height="50">, then <u>a</u> will be imaginary, and writing <br>
        <img src="imageoit.jpg" width="131" height="58"> , <br>
        the above formulas become at once <br>
        <img src="imagekpq.jpg" width="266" height="55"> , <br>
        and <br>
        <img src="images8q.jpg" width="158" height="55"> . <br>
        In this case the current starts from zero and rises to a
        maximum; it then falls to zero and becomes reversed, after which
        1t passes through a series of oscillations. The discharge
        therefore does not take place in a single flow from one coating
        to the other, but a back-rush sets in, and a series of currents,
        or oscillations. occur alternately in opposite directions. </p>
      <p>The current attains its maximum intensity when <br>
        <img src="imagenbf.jpg" width="116" height="50"> (maximum
        current) </p>
      <p>The zero value of the current is reached when <br>
        <img src="imagehq9.jpg" width="73" height="21">&nbsp; (zero
        current) <br>
        and consequently the charge at the same time is at its maximum,
        for we have&nbsp;<img src="imageu7e.jpg" width="63" height="50">.
        Thus the charge oscillates backwards and forwards, attaining
        positive and negative maxima after the lapse of equal intervals
        , the time of a complete oscillation being </p>
      <p><img src="imagebia.jpg" width="134" height="82"></p>
      <p>If the resistance be small compared with the reciprocal of the
        capacity we may use the approximate formula </p>
      <p><img src="images7v.jpg" width="100" height="27"> . </p>
      <p>[ If the capacity be expressed in electrostatic measure and the
        self-induction in electromagnetic, this expression takes the
        form&nbsp;<img src="imagetn7.jpg" width="71" height="56">&nbsp;
        where v is the velocity of light. ] </p>
      <p>The successive maximum charges occur when I = 0, or&nbsp;<img
          src="imagel2m.jpg" width="73" height="21"> , they are
        therefore <br>
        <img src="image5ra.jpg" width="290" height="44"><br>
        . <br>
        The quantities therefore diminish in geometrical progression,
        and the energy of the charge diminishes correspondingly on each
        oscillation, being lost by radiation into space, or in heating
        the circuit, or both. </p>
      <p>Whether the discharge is continuous or oscillatory therefore
        depends on whether 4L is less or greater than CR<sup>2</sup>,
        and an oscillatory discharge may be obtained either by
        increasing L or sufficiently diminishing C and R. </p>
      <p>These predictions of analysis have been confirmed, as Thomson
        suggested, by examining the spark, during discharge, by means of
        a revolving mirror. In Feddersen's experiments the image of the
        spark in a revolving mirror was viewed through a telescope. When
        the resistance of the circuit was high the spark was merely
        drawn out in width , that is, at right angles to its length; but
        when the resistance was sufficiently reduced, so that the
        oscillating discharge might occur, the band was reduced to a
        broken image consisting of a series of strips, each strip
        corresponding to a discharge.&nbsp; For an account of the
        researches made in this department see Wiedemann's Elektricitat,
        vol. iv. pp. 177, etc. </p>
      <p>In closing let me say to the scientific men who are, should we
        say, skeptical but not antagonistic to the Moray presentation
        and demonstrations. Do you believe that the demonstrations
        claimed to have been made by Moray have been made? If you do,
        why are they not enough to convince any man? Can you point out
        one way that they could have been faked that has not been
        overcome in the demonstrations? If you do not believe the
        demonstrations have been made as claimed, go and talk with those
        who have written the letters. There are too many reliable men
        who will tell you that they saw what is claimed and that the
        thing is as claimed. Now if you do accept the letters as
        genuine, what is the question? Moray fooled those for whom he
        has demonstrated? Man alive, Moray must be some fake to fool
        such electrical engineers and other electrical experts together
        with the one hundred or more intelligent men for whom this thing
        has been demonstrated more than one hundred times. </p>
      <p>Every demonstration has been the same, and unless one is so
        prejudiced that he is bound he won't believe, how are you going
        to get around what has been done? If you won't believe, in fair
        mindedness you ought to be willing to point out why you do not.
        If you say because it is not in harmony with science, what does
        that prove? Nothing. What is Science? Is the world not every now
        and then forced to change its law on science, as we know them,
        to agree with proven facts? Saying a thing won't work when it
        has been working for many years is a rather strange way to
        answer a question. The fact remains these demonstrations have
        been given. No sane man can say they have not. Now then if they
        are not faked then they are what is claimed for them. If they
        are fake, should not the type of men who have made such detailed
        investigations been able to detect the fake? The accounts of
        these demonstrations have been stated in such clear, plain
        language that you who have any scientific training can see the
        demonstration just as clearly in your mind's eye as if you had
        the machine before you. Here are two poles, one wire for an
        antenna with insulators at each end. A ground is driven and one
        wire run over from that. The antenna wire and the ground wire
        are connected to the Moray device. All is complete; every part
        of the device is tested: no energy is there. The device is tuned
        and the antenna and ground in connection become alive with a
        very high frequency current and the things are done that the
        letters claim. What are you going to do about it? Do you not
        think that in fairness, unless you can point out one way in
        which that energy could have gotten there except as claimed for
        by Moray, that it is your duty to say, "The demonstrations as
        given establish this thing as a fact in spite of all our own
        ideas." If this thing has been done in such a way that it is
        impossible for a man to fake, then is it not a fact? And if no
        man can point out one way that it could be fake then what?
        Moray's answer is that as soon as any man can give one point
        that has not been covered, that leaves any room for doubt, then
        will he be willing to overcome that point. But if you cannot
        point out any weak points, and no one can, then there are none.
        Every point has been covered is the claim of the inventor. Why
        should he give "side shows" to any one unless they can point
        some new point which they can see has not been covered by what
        has been done? Just to satisfy each man by letting him see with
        no objective in sight is worse than wasted effort. </p>
      <p>Men of science, if you will deal in facts, Moray will welcome
        your objections, but he can demonstrate until Dooms Day, he can
        write until the same and talk theory until we come to the point
        one Doctor of Science did when he said that one hundred divided
        by one hundred fifteen equals three. All of that will not
        overcome the fact that these demonstrations have been given.
        They are facts and doubt will not overcome facts. It takes more
        facts. The facts required are drawings and explanations on some
        possible way these demonstrations could be anything but what is
        claimed by the inventor. And gentlemen, until this is done you
        cannot in reason expect Moray to take you seriously as he has
        looked in vain for a certain few to okay this. When an
        instrument is in every section of this world of ours, maybe
        these last Doubting Thomases will have to give in. But,
        gentlemen, if you have no foundation for your claims that it
        can't be done, why try to build without a foundation? Doubt is
        no foundation upon which to build against a foundation of facts
        upon which a house of facts is built. </p>

      <p>Stars give an idea of where the antenna and ground has been
        disconnected in the accounts gives of the demonstrations, and in
        each case the lights go out and a heavy brush discharge leaps
        many inchs between the points of disconnection. If the
        connection is again made at once, the light again appears, but
        if the connection is not made the device becomes electrically
        dead, and must again be tuned in and the oscillations started
        before the device will operate. Standard light globes and
        beating appliances are used. No change of house wiring is
        necessary. Such demonstrations have been made miles away from
        all power lines, and on antennas erected by those for whom
        demonstrations were being made. </p>

      <p>Gentlemen: </p>
      <p>&nbsp;At the time of this writing another year of research is
        about to close on my efforts with "Radiant Energy." During the
        year the capacity of this discovery has been increased over 2000
        times what it was a year ago and greatly simplified. During the
        past five years many men of Science have come from foreign
        countries and from the east and west and have been given
        demonstrations and not one of them has been able to find any
        fault with what they have heard or seen. Names of these Doctors
        of Science will be furnished upon request. These men have had
        the device opened for their inspection and have pronounced the
        demonstrations wonderful, that the current is high frequency,
        the color of the light different, that the device carries over
        six times as much current without even getting slightly warm as
        any other electrical device of like construction known to man
        today could do without bursting into flame. That the tubes used
        are far more powerful than anything known to science today. The
        drawings, circuits and theory have been pronounced by leading
        men of science as scientifically, electrically, mechanically
        sound and correct. <br>
        I welcome and invite any man or group of men to meet me and
        dispute my claims or show even any slight inconsistencies in my
        discoveries or the theory upon which they are based. All have
        stood the severest tests o f inspection and being based on facts
        will stand every test that can be devised. This statement is
        made without reservations of any kind whatsoever. </p>
      <p>Very truly yours; </p>

        <br>
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>The Words "Radiant Energy" and "Dr. Moray" have been synonymous
        for the past twenty years. </p>
      <p>The reader should bear in mind that most of the ideas as set
        forth in the following pages, as also later date, were first
        given to the world by Dr. Moray from 1911 to 1931, and therefore
        should be read with that thought in mind. </p>
      <p>In the past we permitted ourselves to be put on the defensive
        in our attempts to prove our stand. This was a mistake, as TRUTH
        should never be put on the defensive. The system of instruction
        of the Far East rather than that of the Western World should be
        used in advancing new discoveries of truth. In the Far East the
        teacher does not stop to prove each theory or fact. The message
        is delivered whether his hearers agree with him or not. He does
        not care whether they all agree with him or not, for he feels
        sure those who are ready for the truth he teaches 'rill
        recognize it, and for the others, if they are not prepared to
        receive the truth; no amount of argument will help matters. The
        Eastern teacher knows that much of his teaching is but the
        planting of seed which will grow and be recognized only after
        the lapse of time. </p>
      <p>We do not, mean that anyone should blindly accept everything
        presented to him, but history, repeating itself, does prove that
        mankind goes on from one generation to another blindly closing
        its mind to new lines of thought only because he does not or
        will not. understand or grasp the situation and the laws
        involved. Just as those who.should have known better rejected
        the telephone as impossible because, to quote, "It is impossible
        to transmit the human voice over a copper wire." That was true
        when the telephone was discovered by Josia Coppersmith, it is
        true today and it will always be true. It is impossible to
        transmit the human voice over a copper wire. Yet in spite of
        that, the telephone does work. One might even go so far as to
        state there is no such thing as a human voice, yet man transmits
        his thoughts to one another by what we commonly refer to as
        "speech" and "hearing" in spite of the fact that man's vocal
        chords are not transmitters of other than mechanical vibrations
        and all the so-called sound originates in the skull of the
        hearer and not in the vocal chords of the speaker. </p>
      <p>As we asked the question over fifteen years ago, we repeat that
        question now: "Why should man waste his time and efforts in
        trying to split the atom when nature is doing it all the time
        for us out in space?" Why not use the energy offered us in place
        of worrying about why grass is green in the hope it will
        discover for us a new source of energy which has been sitting on
        our doorsteps since the World began? </p>
      <p>The salt of the earth is energy and the evolution of matter and
        the evolution of forces in the process of the creation of all
        things. By the proper uses of these natural laws of energy and
        matter, matter is turned into energy. That is something we all
        agree can be done, but do we understand that man can by the
        proper use of these same laws take energy and reverse the
        process and change energy into matter. </p>
      <p>It is not a question of finding new elements, but of being able
        to use energy and matter in whatever wave length one finds them
        and of changing them to any desired wave length or frequency by
        letting nature do our "atom splitting" for us. It is cheaper,
        faster, more sure, and the potential possibilities far exceed
        any puny efforts of man. I say puny, for, while man may discover
        new means of causing explosions and of creating explosives, he
        has not and cannot split the atom. It is merely a question of a
        change in form, no less matter and no less energy. We separate
        energy only to have it join elsewhere. If we can split the atom
        actually, we will have split the chain that holds the cycle of
        the Universe together and, like one drop of gasoline exploding
        all the other drops of gasoline near it, so will the chain of
        atoms, go right on splitting every other atom of the Universe,
        and that cannot be done any more than one can compress water. </p>
      <p>In the laboratories of the Universe we find the .uranium and
        radium series changing from uranium to radium, radium into radon
        and radium A, B, C, C, D (radio lead), radium E, F, and finally
        into lead, and if we follow the process, lead into gold and so
        on. In the laboratory we have changed lead into gold and by
        reversing the process changed lead into polonium or radium F. If
        this step can be taken either way, is there any reason why
        further steps cannot be taken? </p>
      <p>This is not a case of splitting the atom, but merely of
        addition, multiplication, division and subtraction of the
        combinations of the atoms, but not the breaking into of the
        chain of the Universe. It is plain evolution of matter and
        evolution of forces and there is no need in highly
        overestimating the accomplishment under false interpretation of
        the facts. </p>
      <p>As frequency or oscillations is the basis of the existence of
        all animal, vegetable and mineral matter, one could explode
        matter from any distance to which the proper oscillation could
        be transmitted. Our experiments have proven to our complete
        satisfaction that stores of ammunition on the land, in the air
        or on the sea can be thus destroyed. </p>
      <p>Our experiments have also satisfied us that gravity is akin to,
        if not an electrical oscillation so well balanced that we might,
        for the lack of a better name, almost call it a "Wattless
        current" until some force is exerted to oppose its potential and
        then gravity opposes such force. This means gravity can be
        controlled and unlimited advancement made in air navigation,
        with the only concern left being air speed and momentum. </p>
      <p>There is much of value to be developed in fields.that have not
        even been touched and about which very little is known in
        research in the atomic nucleus. We have made some astounding
        discoveries in artificial radioactivity set up, not by the usual
        expensive method with the cyclotron, but by the Moray method. A
        new world is to be entered through ultra sonics, hyper and ultra
        high frequency currents created through the use of certain tube
        discoveries working in ionizations as well as electronic action.
      </p>
      <p>Too little work has been done with rays or frequencies around
        106 to 103 A. U., no doubt, because the mechanical means used in
        working in this field has been attempted with practically the
        same type of equipment used in the one-meter field. We might as
        well try to carry water in a sieve. </p>
      <p>It is my belief that Television also will never be a complete
        commercial success until the method of approach is changed to a
        celestial wave rather than the present approach. </p>
      <p>One should not enter these experimental fields in the gamma
        band without the proper protection, for one will be risking his
        life in this work without a proper absorber. Water, the common
        means of protection, has proven of little value as an absorber
        in most of our investigations. Neither has boric acid water or
        hydrogen gas proven too satisfactory as an absorber. </p>
      <p>In September, 1943, a letter was written by us on transmutation
        of metals to some parties interested in mercury experiments,
        part of which letter follows: </p>
      <p>In the reducing of colloids from a non-crystalline state to a
        crystalline state, the current and rays used must be such as to
        produce a synchronous action. It is well known that colloidal
        "solutions" do not obey the solution laws: the alterations of
        the boiling and freezing points are inappreciable and the
        osmotic pressures very small. A colloidal solution is, in
        reality, a disperse system, and in the case of attempting to
        "knock down" the suspended metallic colloid one must cause what
        might be called coagulation and precipitation of the metallic
        colloid found in metallic sulphides, chlorides or salts of a
        metal in a non-crystalline form to a coagulated and crystailine
        state. </p>
      <p>Now, whatever frequency of current used and whatever ray or
        rays used, the frequency of the current and the wave length of
        the ray or rays used should harmonize so as to blend or
        synchronize with the natural frequency or wave length of the
        substance treated so as to produce the synchronous action that
        will set up a vibration for which we might "coin" an expression
        and call this action a "super-ultra sonic reaction" between the
        frequency of current, the wave length of the ray, and the
        vibratory rate of the substance treated to cause the desired
        metabolic or catalystic reaction which will result in, I am
        convinced, a complete change in the mode of mining. That the
        mining of the future will not be done in the crude ways of the
        past. Man's work with animals, vegetables, fruits, flowers, and
        all sorts of animal and vegetable life has shown that he can
        improve on the things that nature produced. Man must first go to
        nature to learn, but then he must learn to improve over nature's
        ways. I am positively convinced that man can improve nature's
        mineral deposits by making "colloids" "grow," if one does not
        object to such an expression. Or, in other words, speed up
        nature's action and obtain the same or better results in a
        fraction of the time taken by nature. </p>
      <p>In the catalystic production of metals from "colloids," one
        must remember that like begets like, and one cannot obtain
        copper from the "salts" of some other metallic deposit. </p>
      <p>In the catalystic production of metals from colloids one must
        not confuse this process with the evolution of forces and the
        evolution of matter, the former being the process of "growing"
        from colloids, the latter the actual phenomena of energy
        becoming matter and matter, energy. This still is not a process
        of splitting the atom, but changing the arrangements of them. </p>
      <p>The real test of science in modern destruction lies not in the
        explosion of matter by matter or matter by energy; but energy by
        energy, "super" ultra sonics against the vibrations of matter. </p>

        <p><b>GENERAL STATEMENT</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>Compiled in Los Angeles, California, January, 1939, from Moray
        notes and printed booklets written by Dr. Moray from 1913 to
        1926. See "Beyond the Light Rays" and other publications. This
        account may lack continuity. </p>
      <p>This account will endeavor to give a brief explanation of the
        Moray Radiant Energy device whereby it is possible to utilize
        the vast source of energy of the universe without a prime mover
        through the splitting of the atom by the action of the universe
        not man-made splitting of the atom. </p>
      <p>The Moray device is not perpetual motion, but it utilizes
        energy that already exists and transforms it into useful forms.
        An electrical generator is in the true sense not a generator, as
        it creates nothing. Electricity is not made by the generator, it
        is merely pumped. From that standpoint, an electric generator
        might be referred to as an electric pump and the Moray Radiant
        Energy as a high-speed oscillating atom turbine. </p>
      <p>On page seventeen of the "Nature of the World and of Man"
        (compiled by the technical staff, Chicago Institute of
        Technology), we find it states that our planet is receiving
        energy from the sun continuously at the rate of 160,000
        horsepower per inhabitant of the earth at the present time. </p>
      <p>The following is taken from "Experiments with Alternate
        Currents of High Potential and High Frequency," by Nikola Tesla,
        page fifty-eight, written in 1904: </p>
      <p>"Ere many generations pass our machinery will be driven by
        power obtainable at any point in the universe — Is this energy
        Static or Kinetic? If Static, our hopes are in vain; if Kinetic,
        and this we know it is for certain, then it is a mere question
        of time when men will succeed in attaching their machinery to
        the very wheel work of nature." </p>
      <p>The aurora borealis is considered to be very definitely an
        electrical phenomenon produced by the passage of electric
        charges through the rarefied gases of the higher atmosphere. </p>
      <p>The conversion of matter to energy in the stars is now very
        generally accepted as demonstrated, and reasoning from what
        occurs in radioactive disintegration, during which energy waves
        are radiated, we may conclude that energy waves of very high
        frequency are sent out from the stars, one of which is our sun.
      </p>
      <p>As in the reception of radio waves, so in this case the circuit
        is a tuned arrangement to respond to the particular wave
        frequency "oscillations" which it is desired to intercept. Dr.
        Moray uses a "valve" to prevent return of the energy to the
        outer circuit and force it to go through the power application
        circuit. </p>
      <p>Experiments have been made at different places many miles away
        from all power lines, one experiment being given at a point more
        than 50 miles from all power lines, and 26 miles from even a
        farmer's telephone. The places for these experiments were
        selected by the members of the parties making the test and not
        by the inventor, and the places were not prearranged but
        selected by them as they drove along in their own car, not the
        car of the inventor, looking for a place to make the test. </p>
      <p>The device on an endurance test was operated under standard R.
        R. seals for a total of 157 hours and 55 minutes, when the seals
        were broken and the device put under severe strain and tests
        made for about an hour longer and then shut off. </p>
      <p>Close examination of the device disclosed that all parts were
        in perfect shape and could have been run indefinitely. During
        the entire test the lights burned evenly and brightly without
        flickering and there was no change in the brilliancy from day to
        day. </p>
      <p>The quantity of current passing through the secondary of the
        transformer is sufficient to burn up wire of that size if
        ordinary current were used, yet there is no heating of the
        transformer even though there is no circulation of air through
        it to cool it, as it is completely enclosed. All parts of the
        machine run absolutely cool, regardless of the length of time
        operated. </p>
      <p>It makes no difference whether one fifty-watt lamp is used or
        whether fifty or more of them are connected to the machine, the
        draft of current is adapted to the load. </p>
      <p>There is not a sound from the machine when in operation, there
        being no moving parts. </p>
      <p>In 1931 an experimental demonstration was made in the presence
        of a nationally known physicist, a professor in one of the
        greatest universities of the country, at which time he noted and
        mentioned the following: </p>
      <p>"That when the oscillators are connected in the circuit, the
        condensers fill slowly, and the longer the current is applied to
        charge them, the greater the charge they take, up to their
        maximum for the applied voltage, much as in filling a bucket by
        pouring the water into it, instead of taking the charge
        practically instantaneously, as is ordinarily the case with
        condensers." </p>
      <p>"That the lights on one spot are much hotter than is ever the
        case with any current used at the present time, due to the
        incandescence of the gas in the globes under the influence of
        the very high frequency that the rest of the globe remained
        cool." </p>
      <p>"That the size of wire in the transformer could not carry the
        amperage passing through it without burning up, if ordinary
        current were used, yet the wires remained absolutely cool no
        matter how long the machine operated." </p>
      <p>"The above points show that there is developed something which
        is entirely out of the ordinary, and cannot be accounted for on
        the basis of induction from existing power lines or current from
        batteries." </p>
      <p>In later experiments tests were made successfully while the
        device was set up in a moving automobile. </p>
      <p>Beginning in.1925 many men of science have come from foreign
        countries and from the East and West and have witnessed
        experimental demonstrations and not one of them has been able to
        find any fault with what they have seen or heard. Names of these
        men of science will be furnished upon request. These men have
        had the device opened for their inspection and have pronounced
        the experiments wonderful, that the current is high frequency,
        the color of the light different, that the device carries many
        times as much current without even getting slightly warm than
        any other electrical device of like construction known to man
        today could do without bursting into flames. That the tubes used
        are far more powerful than anything known to science today. The
        drawings, circuits and theory have been pronounced by leading
        men of science as scientifically, electrically, mechanically
        sound and correct. </p>
      <p>It is generally accepted now by science, and Dr. Moray's device
        proves, there is energy coming from somewhere, that the earth is
        surrounded by such a field of energy. </p>
      <p>This energy, or as Dr. Moray explains it — these oscillations
        of Energy, are picked up by the device through the oscillators,
        or neutron bombardment. As stated, these surgings or
        oscillations of Energy coming and going as the waves of the sea
        are picked up by the Moray Device because the Moray Device is
        tuned to oscillate in harmony with the oscillations of the
        universe. Every oscillation, whether large or small, is
        completed during the same interval of time. The beat note of
        time, the heart beats of life, the oscillations of the Universe
        all prove the same great fact that oscillations are all governed
        by the same cycle of time, completed during the same interval of
        time, and as I stated before, these waves of energy have a
        regular beat note of time, coming and going as the waves of the
        sea, but in a very definite mathematical order of time, coming
        to the earth from every direction with a regular beat note that
        might be referred to as the Father of Time, the Sire of
        Gravitation. </p>
      <p>This energy has a definite elastic rigidity and density, which
        is subject to displacement and strains. When the strain is
        removed, this medium will spring back to its old position and
        beyond, surging back and forth as the waves of the sea, and will
        continue to oscillate until the original pressure is used up. If
        the internal impedence is too great, there will be no
        oscillations, but it will merely slide back in a dead beat to
        its unrestrained state. Cutting down the resistance to the
        minimum and by synchronous actions of the device with the
        actions of the Universe, recovery will be quicker and quicker
        until inertia will assert itself and lengthen out the time of
        final recovery by carrying the recoil beyond the natural
        oscillation and thus prolonging the vibrations by oscillation.
        When the recovery is distinctly oscillatory and harmonics set in
        the oscillations will go on forever because of the oscillations
        of the Universe. As I said, these electric oscillations are not
        simple oscillations, but surgings with a definite beat note of
        the evolution of matter and the evolution of energy. </p>
      <p>It is not claimed that all of Dr. Moray's theories are proven,
        but it is claimed that the device works. The results are certain
        and that in the absence of better explanation as given in the
        1931 edition of "Beyond the Light Rays," Dr. Moray's explanation
        is as good as any. </p>
      <p>In explaining this theory in 1929 to a well-known and noted
        American Scientist, he remarked, "You go in your theory back of
        the law of gravitation." </p>
      <p>We may readily take it for granted that a perpetual light, like
        perpetual motion, is an impossibility. I say that because I do
        not believe in perpetual light or motion, which, in a sense, is
        one and the same thing as getting something for nothing. </p>
      <p>In this day and age it is not well to say anything is
        impossible, but getting something for nothing goes beyond my
        conception of thought. What I have done in Radiant Energy has
        been and is perhaps rightfully called "radical." Nevertheless,
        of the great number of learned men who have seen and heard of my
        work, not one has been able to disprove my claims, theories or
        discoveries. Among those in question have been some of America's
        foremost in Science, although they have spent from many hours to
        days on my theory and claims and test demonstrations. Hence this
        further explanation of the Moray theory, on which Moray has
        spent his time from boyhood. </p>
      <p>The facts and theories herein contained are not contrary to
        ideas that science has now accepted. They are, however, original
        with me in application and when I first publicly advanced them
        in 1925 they were "killed" as it were by those who heard them
        before they got very far. Be that as it may, I have taken
        "Radiant Energy" and found a means of using it. Heat, light,
        etc., are not things in themselves, but sensations or effects
        produced by this "Radiant Energy" directly or indirectly from
        matter. </p>
      <p>Electricity is vibrations or radiation. Where ether (or if you
        do not like that name, call it what you will) is quiescent, we
        see nothing. Light causes vibrations of this "ether" and it is
        these vibrations which cause our eyes to detect. All substances
        are really combinations of one primordial substance, i. e.
        electricity, or, in other words, electricity is specifically
        modified ether. Electrons in motion go to constitute an electric
        current. Ether waves in motion go to constitute an electric
        current. What electricity is to matter, so is electric force to
        common mechanical force, and electrical inertia to common
        inertia. By inertia, I mean the ratio of force to acceleration.
        Perhaps electric inertia might be defined as the ratio of
        electric motive force to the acceleration of electric
        displacement. <br>
        Below will be found some excerpts from some Scientific books. </p>
      <p>"<i>ASTRONOMY</i>", by Robert H. Baker, Ph. D. Professor of
        Astronomy, University of Illinois, page 303: </p>
      <p>"Another problem relates to the apparent lavish expenditure of
        this radiation. Of all the energy that pours forth from the sun,
        less than one part in 200 million is intercepted by the planets
        and their satellites. The remainder spreads through interstellar
        space with little chance, so far as we can know, of being
        recovered. The suggestion that the sun shines only in the
        direction of material that can intercept it makes an appeal from
        the point of view of economy, but appears to have little else to
        recommend it. It would seem that nature is squandering its
        resources of energy so prodigally that it must end in
        bankruptcy; but we doubtless have at present an imperfect
        account of the situation." </p>
      <p>"<i>FOUNDATIONS OF THE UNIVERSE</i>" by M. Luckiesh, D.Ss.
        Director of Lighting Research Laboratory, General Electric
        Company, printed in 1925, page V: </p>
      <p>"In the far-off stellar crucibles we see the same laws being
        obeyed as in our laboratories. As we trace down to the almost
        infinitesimal constituents of the extremely minute atom we find
        that apparently it does not exist at all as the realistic matter
        which we have supposed it to be. There at its very foundation it
        seems to consist of electric charges which probably simulate the
        motions of celestial bodies * * *. It is becoming more and more
        certain that the apparent complexity of nature is due to our
        lack of knowledge. As the picture unfolds it promises a
        marvelous simplicity." <br>
        Again quoting from "<i>FOUNDATIONS OF THE UNIVERSE</i>," by Dr.
        Luckiesh of General Electric, pages 41-43: </p>
      <p>"The great success of the atomistic principle as it is involved
        in the kinetic theory of matter is one of the wonders of the
        modern scientific age. It is to be expected that it has found
        other applications equally fascinating and promising. It is now
        being pressed further into the service of explaining the
        structure of matter…" </p>
      <p>"When Maxwell (1873) propounded the electromagnetic theory of
        light (radiation), his achievement was epochal. The exact manner
        in which the radiant energy traversed space was not known, and
        the exact epochal event was the founding by Planck (1900) of the
        quantum theory. Here we have the atomistic principle applied to
        energy instead of being confined to the material of the universe
        as it had been. In other words, in the quantum theory we have
        the atomistic idea applied to physical processes. We now have
        the atom of matter, the atom (electron) of electricity, and the
        atom (quantum) of action (a product of energy and time). Planck
        assumed the emission of radiation (from the sun, a lamp
        filament, etc.) to occur discontinuously. He conceived elements
        of energy of equal magnitude analogous to the equality of
        electrons, or atoms of a given element. Radiation or radiant
        energy is emitted of various wave lengths or frequencies which
        must be taken into account in laws of radiation… Now the
        physicist uses quanta as commonly as he does electrons and atoms
        and molecules. Bodies are built of molecules, the molecules of
        atoms, and the atoms of electrons (and protons). Here we see the
        atomistic principle applied to "material" (matter) and then to
        electricity (What shall we call it?). Finally, a physical
        process — the radiation emitted by the electrons — is divided
        into quanta. With such pictures of the universe being
        constructed we may cease to be surprised at anything, but our
        interest and admiration will grow. Will we ever get to the final
        foundation?" </p>
      <p>"One of the most marvelous relationships that has ever been
        revealed in the entire science of physics . is that between
        light and electricity. Knowing what we do at the present time in
        regard to the structure of atoms, this relationship is not quite
        so surprising. However, considering the total absence of
        knowledge a half century ago, pertaining to the existence. of
        electrons in atoms of matter, the sudden revelation that light
        (and radiation in general) was an electrical phenomena was very
        startling and revolutionary. Even today these persons who are
        unfamiliar with fundamental physics find it difficult to believe
        that energy traveling from yonder star to the eyes is
        electromagnetic in nature. But that it is so has been amply
        proved. The atom in those distance stellar crucibles having
        moving electrons which are emitting electromagnetic waves of
        many wavelengths or frequencies. Here on Earth we have many
        'receiving stations' which are tuned to certain ranges of
        wavelengths." </p>
      <p>"<i>RADIANT ENERGY</i>" by Edgar Lucien Larkin, Director Lowe
        Observatory, Echo Mountain, California, printed in 1903, on page
        17: </p>
      <p>"Radiant here means proceeding from a center in straight lines
        in every direction. Energy is internal and inherent. Professor
        Barker, "Physics," page 4, says: 'Energy is defined as a
        condition of matter in virtue of which any definite portion may
        effect changes in any other definite portion.' This was written
        in 1892, and discoveries since confirm it. Energy then, is a
        state of matter, or, rather, the result of a particular state or
        condition in which matter may be when any observed phase of
        energy appears." </p>

        Salt Lake City, Utah. <br>
        Feb. 26, 1940 </p>
      <p>Dear Sir: </p>
      <p>We wish to thank you for the recent business you have given us,
        and hope we may have the pleasure of serving you again. </p>
      <p>For your information we wish to state that in all cases where
        natives included any of your lights we found them to be of
        greater intensity than ordinary illumination. They seem to burn
        in the negative to such a degree that we found it necessary to
        cut special masks to hold back the immediate area of
        illumination in order to obtain any outline of the globes
        whatever. We found the average negative required about ten times
        the normal exposure .in the areas where lights were used. This
        is especially interesting as in photographing ordinary lights
        when shining directly into the lens of camera the light outline
        can be plainly seen even, though the negative is dense at point
        of illumination and in the case of your lights the.only detail
        possible to obtain had to be brought out through holding back
        dense area as mentioned above. </p>
      <p>Very truly yours, <br>

      <p>One hears a great deal about the work being done by the
        cyclotron or atom-smasher, from the first one constructed by Dr.
        C. E. Lawrence at the University of California to the sixteenth
        'American cyclotron now under construction at the University of
        Illinois. The University of Illinois already had a small one,
        the second one built in the world; but this new one; which will
        be ready about April or May of 1942, and which will have taken
        many many months to construct, will have six huge iron castings
        weighing 60 tons. One section will have two miles of copper
        tubing wound into a dozen flat coils. </p>
      <p>Hundreds of thousands of dollars are being spent for apparatus
        with which to effect transformations and many of the greatest
        scientists are giving their entire time to this work. All this
        time and money could be saved if we would but realize the fact
        that nature is splitting atoms all the time for us. That is the
        source of energy of the Universe being given to us free of
        charge. </p>
      <p>The Carnegie Institution of Washington, D. C., has its Atomic
        Physics Laboratory. At Harvard University mercury has apparently
        been turned into gold by the cyclotron. This experiment was
        reported in Washington to the American Physical Society by Dr.
        Sherr and Professor Bainbridge. </p>
      <p>The report shows, however, that the amount of gold obtained was
        so exceedingly minute that its presence was shown only by an
        indirect method. Further, it is in a form of gold that vanishes
        rapidly. It decays like radium. With one form detected, after 48
        minutes half of a given amount was gone; after another 48
        minutes half of what remained was gone and so on. Other.forms
        lasted but a few days. Small amounts of platinum were also
        formed by transmutation of mercury. </p>
      <p>A tiny amount of gold was. mixed with about a pound of the
        bombarded mercury as a bait to draw the transmuted gold atoms
        together. </p>
      <p>One can see, therefore, that transmutation of metals is an
        'accomplished fact, something which twenty years ago would have
        been called impossible by the same institutions that are
        spending so much time and money today on this research. </p>
      <p>So again it is with great satisfaction that the Research
        Institute and its predecessor, the Moray Scientific
        Laboratories, sees that the work it has been doing and for which
        it was called all sorts of kind (?) names is being followed by
        others. </p>
      <p>We say followed by others advisedly, because as early as 1911
        the personnel which is now a part of the Research Institute,
        advanced as facts, discoveries of rays of the universe and of
        natter, which today are being substantiated in the greatest
        institutions of the world. </p>
      <p>As early as 1925, by a method far less complicated and
        expensive, the Moray Scientific Laboratoies, the fore-runner of
        the Research Institute, changed common lead so that it could be
        heated to a white hot heat before melting. Other treated lead
        which contained no precious metals before treatment assayed as
        follows: May 28, 1940, from one ounce of lead treated at Salt
        Lake City, Utah, and assayed at the Boaz Mine, Norris, Montana,
        assayed 35c in gold. Five ounces of untreated soil assayed blank
        while the same amount of treated soil assayed at the rate per
        ton of $122.50 in gold. </p>
      <p>July 25, 1940, an assay was made by the Union Assay Office of
        Salt Lake City, Utah, from about 50 c.c. of treated artesian
        water (untreated water had no precious mineral content) assayed
        at the rate per ton of $10.50 in gold, $2.63 silver. Sample
        serial No. 88193. Test serial No. 7209 made July 27, 1941, on
        another sample treated, assayed 70c in gold and 43c in silver. <br>
        It must not be understood that this was done on a commercial
        basis but in the laboratory just as the results given above that
        were obtained at Harvard. The only difference was that the gold,
        silver and platinum obtained at the Research Institute was not
        in such tiny amounts that their presence could only be detected
        by indirect methods, but that they were in great enough
        quantities that they could be assayed. They could be milled and
        separated from the other metals and could be weighed.
        Furthermore, none of these precious metals vanished, but still
        exist and can be examined by anyone. </p>
      <p>In America and abroad, especially in Germany, scientists have
        devised the thermal diffusion method which has proven to be one
        of the most efficient methods of separating the different forms
        of isotopes of the elements. With this method scientists have
        separated not only the isotopes of chlorine, but those of neon,
        krypton and others, but again this is an expensive process. <br>
        By the methods used in the laboratories of the Research
        Institute very interesting results have been had with copper,
        lead, aluminum and magnesium. A cheap alloy which blends well
        with other metals has been experimented with, the commercial
        price will be much less than magnesium, yet the atomic weight is
        about the same after it is fused by special rays and frequencies
        of a Radiant Energy device developed in the Institute
        laboratories. </p>
      <p>Successful experiments were also carried on in 1940 to greatly
        increase the radioactivity of carnotite, uranium and other
        radio-active substances. This method brings results heretofore
        not obtained by any other method. </p>

      <p>Hollywood, Calif., <br>
        May 20, 1942. <br>
        Dear Mr. .............. </p>
      <p>With reference to our recent conversations and as a means of
        clarifying my position, let me repeat some of the statements I
        have made to you. <br>
        At that time and other times I wrote you, among other things,
        the following, which I will again repeat: </p>
      <p>"It is recognized that in addition to possessing kinetic.
        energy, the atom is capable of absorbing energy internally. This
        internal energy would seem to be associated with the
        configuration of the particles of which the atom is composed.
        While under ordinary conditions an atom is in what is known as
        the normal state, or the state in which we find matter
        apparently neither giving off, nor absorbing energy. The
        internal energy of the atom can be altered; for while under
        ordinary conditions an atom is in what is known as the normal
        state, when the internal energy of the atom exceeds that of its
        noraml state it is said to be excited. Excitations may be caused
        in several ways, among which is the collision of the atom with
        rapidly moving positive or negative particles, or as in the
        breaking of the lines of force in the modern electromagnetic
        generator, which I prefer to call an electric pump, for the
        electric generator does not create the electrical energy any
        more than the water pump creates the water. Kinetic energy is
        given up, or, in other words, this excitation causes these
        rapidly moving particles to give up some or all of their kinetic
        energy to the atom during the collision. A limiting case of
        excitation is ionization, in which energy is absorbed by the
        atom sufficiently to allow a loosely bound electron to leave the
        atom against the electro-static force which tends to hold it
        within the atom. An atom which has given up one or more
        electrons is said to be ionized. </p>
      <p>It is possible that ionization, or in other words excitation,
        may take place in successive steps through absorption of quanta
        energy, or, in other words, through the evolution of matter and
        the evolution of forces, matter is continuously changing into
        energy and energy continually changing into matter. The return
        of an ionized atom to a state of lower energy is associated with
        electromagnetic radiation. So also from the process of
        ionization which may result from a number of causes, and the one
        we are interested in is through cosmic radiation, electric
        energy becomes associated with the oscillation or sonic of the
        universe. The higher the frequency, the greater the ionization
        or excitation. Or, as I have stated before, matter is
        susceptible to motion; the universe continually changing into
        energy and energy into matter. All energy appertains either to
        matter or excitation of energy and continually passes from one
        to the other, or in other words, continually possessing kinetic
        energy. There, at its very foundation, matter consists of an
        electric charge which governs the very motion of the planets and
        suns. I consider gamma rays or radio activity an electrical
        action only of a different rate of vibration. </p>
      <p>If one, therefore, sets up a sonic oscillation, a sonic
        oscillation existing in the realms beyond the light rays, one
        will be in harmony with the oscillations of the universe, the
        energy that is coming to this earth continuously, oscillating
        back and forth in a definite sonic. Some call it radio activity.
      </p>
      <p>Relativity theory suggests that radiation of any large amount
        of energy is accompanied by a like loss of mass. This loss of
        mass is given up as the loss of energy. If in the formation of
        an amount of energy we have an accomplished loss of mass, as has
        been explained by astro-physicists to account for the radiant
        energy of the sun and the stars, it is equally reasonable to
        believe that energy in returning back to the source from whence
        it came, is capable of again creating mass, and through this
        process we have a lowering in the potential with no less mass
        and no less energy. The energy used to drive any of our great
        power systems has not been absorbed, it merely sinks back to the
        place from whence it came, as water over a wheel. There is
        nothing about this that suggests, perpetual motion, but it is
        merely a case of the evolution of matter and the evolution of
        forces. This might be called the economy of the universe, for if
        it were not so, nature could be accused of squandering her
        resources of energy so prodigally that nature would eventually
        end up in bankruptcy, but doubtless in our present theories, we
        have a very imperfect account of the situation. </p>
      <p>If we reverse our imagination on what the telescope has taught
        us of the stellar universe, we will find that beyond the
        microscope we have the particles of which everything about us
        consists, obeying every law that is found everywhere from
        stellar space to atomic space. We find bodies in motion and when
        we think how small the proton and electron are, and yet obeying
        the same laws of the universe, we may see the economical
        uselessness of science trying to crack the atom, when nature, or
        call it what you will, is accomplishing the same thing for us in
        stellar and interstellar spaces. Why do something nature is
        already doing for us? Let's use what nature offers as I first
        suggested in 1926 and again in 1931. In the great laboratories
        of the universe we are having done for us something that far
        excells in its performance anything that we may hope to
        accomplish in our laboratories. Why try to do in our small way
        something which nature is already doing for us? From this
        conception we might see that Democritus came close to a great
        scientific truth in his bold statement, when he declared that
        all physical phenomena reduced itself to one single item —
        motion, or, as we might repeat, the sonic of the universe. Let
        me repeat, do not forget the atom is but a counterpart of the
        universe itself, and that light and other radiations exert a
        mechanical pressure upon every object they strike, and that all
        these radiations are essentially electrical in their character.
        There is a breaking down and a building up of the atom
        continuously, and it is the evolution of matter and forces which
        is producing, eternally, unlimited power. </p>
      <p>May it not yet be shown that the dissipated energy which
        results from so much transformation of matter which has
        heretofore been unavailable — or we should say unused by us
        where it has only appeared to be unavailable — should now become
        available to us as an unlimited source of power through the
        Moray discoveries of application of these forces ? </p>
      <p>In the Gamma Rays we find potentials which are equivalent to as
        much as 2,000,000 volts, yet their wave lengths are not the
        shortest known to physicists. In octaves still higher lie rays
        which are known as Cosmic Rays. Who can draw a definite line and
        say how much higher other octaves exist than those of known
        Cosmic Rays? Our starting point for the discovery of these
        different rays was electrical conductivity of the air. It has
        been discovered that conductivity is just as strong by night as
        by day, so that radiations emitted by the sun can scarcely be
        the cause of this energy. May we not, then, accept the theory
        that the sun, in and of itself, has no energy, but is merely a
        rebroadcaster of the great generator — the sonic of the universe
        itself ? That these two, then, matter and energy, are possibly
        one, is the sum total of all that has been found out during the
        centuries of constant research, to be judged by that small
        portion of the universe which is visible to man, who is only
        armed with his infinitesimal telescopes, or with the most
        powerful spectroscopes ever made by man. </p>
      <p>It is the belief of the writer that all space is saturated with
        energies which are doubtless electrical in their ultimate
        energies or very closely allied to electrical action. The
        relation of matter to energy and energy to matter then becomes
        the potential of the universe, one continuous series of
        oscillations, oscillating to and fro like a great pendulum
        across the universe. </p>
      <p>One might ask, "How can one get a steady source of energy from
        such surges?" Could not a steady flow of water be obtained from
        the surgings of the sea ? </p>
      <p>The history of every major scientific discovery has proven that
        argumentation on the merits of a discovery, when judged by
        private interpretation of the scientific facts in question, has
        proven them all impossible and their discoverer a charlatan. </p>
      <p>The above, with all of the other data which has been furnished
        you in the past, such as my general statements on Transmutation
        of Metals; Electricity in Medicine; the Patent Situation; the
        Pictures; and the General Statement on Radiant Energy;
        Electromagnetic Radiation, written in Los Angeles in 1939, which
        contains some quotations from my pamphlet, "Beyond the Light
        Rays," which was written many years ago and printed in 1931,
        should be of sufficient help to you in forming a conception of
        the facts. </p>
      <p>If you should need additional information, do not hesitate to
        request the same. </p>
      <p>I would like to further clarify another point. I have not come
        to you, nor to anyone, trying to peddle Radiant Energy. You came
        to we in regard to Radiant Energy, and I have tried to help you
        to understand my conceptions and the facts surrounding the
        discoveries I have made. If the world wants what they have to
        offer in Radiant Energy, Transmutation of Metals, Ultra Sonics,
        and Electro-Therapy, and the other kindred discoveries that I
        have made, I am more than willing to help them to do so. If not,
        I can and will work out every problem by myself. With kindest
        regards. </p>

        April 17, 1942. <br>
        Dear Mr. .............. </p>
      <p>Your kind letter of April 14, special delivery, came last
        night. </p>
      <p>Letter writing is such an unsatisfactory method of trying to
        put one's ideas over, that I hesitate in trying to express
        myself by letter, but this may serve to review some points in
        our minds, which, however, from the conversations we have had, I
        feel are fully understood by you. </p>
      <p>As to an explanation of my theories of why the Moray
        discoveries of Radiant Energy have given the results
        demonstrated, I have in the past given many complete accounts to
        men of science and others. The data you have had from me goes
        into considerable detail proving the fact that the device does
        all that is claimed for it. Naturally no attempt has been made
        to give, nor will such information be given, as to why or how
        the results are obtained. I feel that you readily appreciate the
        fact that from a standpoint of law and public use patentability
        and a general safety standpoint, there is a definite
        disadvantage in disclosures up to the time when one has on file
        in the United States and desired Foreign Countries all
        applications which it is desired to file. However, the important
        thing is that the machine or device operates and therefore at
        this time theories of operation are unimportant. For instance,
        the explanation of the "back-rush" effect of condensers should
        be sufficient to satisfy anyone as to the operation of the
        condensers in acting as reservoirs for the distribution, of
        energy. This is equally true of the statements about the device
        oscillating in harmony with the oscillations of the universe, in
        face of the evidence of operation which is now in your
        possession, and the data you turned back to me. </p>
      <p>The conversion of matter to energy in the stars is now very
        generally accepted as demonstrated, and reasoning from what
        occurs under radio active disintegration, during which energy
        waves are radiated, we may conclude that energy waves of very
        high frequency are sent out from the stars, one of which is our
        sun. </p>
      <p>As in the reception of radio waves and radio active waves, so
        in this the circuit is tuned and by the right arrangement of our
        own type of special oscillators, frequencies are reduced so they
        may be made to respond to the right arrangements of inductances
        and capacities and of a special "valve" of our own construction,
        to prevent the return of the power to the outer circuit and
        force it to go through the power application circuit. Ordinarily
        when a potential is applied to the terminals of a condenser, a
        full charge is acquired almost instantaneously, but with the
        Moray oscillators filling up somewhat as when water is poured
        into a bucket, the longer the energy is applied, the greater the
        charge taken, up to the maximum capacity for the given potential
        and frequency. This was explained in the data you had, that
        these oscillations of energy are picked up by the Moray device
        and, as stated, these surgings or oscillations of energy are
        coming and going in a regular beat note of time. This energy has
        a definite elastic rigidity and density which is subject to
        displacement and strains. When the strain is removed, this
        energy will surge back and forth as the waves of the sea and
        will continue to oscillate as long as the internal impedence is
        kept within certain limitations and by synchronous actions of
        the device with the actions of the universe, recovery will be
        quicker and quicker until inertia asserts itself and the action
        will become distinctly oscillatory and harmonics set in. Then
        the oscillations of the device will continue with the
        oscillations of the universe. As stated, these oscillations are
        not simple oscillations, but surgings with a definite beat note,
        elastic rigidity and density. </p>
      <p>The leaflets you requested are being sent you under separate
        cover. </p>

      <p>QUOTING FROM "BEYOND THE LIGHT RAYS" </p>
      <p>(First Written in 1928 from Notes of 1913 to 1918 and First
        Printed and Published in 1931) </p>
      <p>In writing this very short account of the oscillating theory of
        the Moray "Radiant Energy" discoveries, one can only touch the
        high spots as many large books would have to be written to even
        in a small way cover the subject. </p>
      <p>Another difficulty which has hindered man in forming a true
        picture of the objective world is that mixed blessing — egotism.
        In early centuries he could not escape from the false assumption
        of his own preeminent importance, and these same shackles are
        still prejudicing the observations of most persons. </p>
      <p>In reference to electrons, neutrons, protons, and ions: It is
        my theory in using these terms that they are the energy of the
        universe, that by some unknown means have become disassociated
        here and there, and these innumerable infinitesimal particles of
        electrified particles constitute (by the forces they exert and
        the disturbances they originate) the substratum of what our
        senses term as matter, and by nature splitting matter the energy
        of the universe is born. </p>
      <p>Matter is susceptible to motion. Ether is susceptible to
        stress. All atoms appertain either to matter or energy, and
        continually pass from one to the other, thus producing kinetic
        energy. There at its very foundation matter consists of
        electrical charges which govern the very motion of celestial
        bodies … i. e., radio active radiations of energy and matter.
        The evolution of matter and the evolution of forces (energy). </p>
      <p>There are ample writings acknowledging that there is unlimited
        energy in the Universe, but to say one is able to tap this
        supply is another matter. If I tell you there is water, good
        cold water, in a glass on your table, but you cannot drink it
        for a million years, what would you think? You know how to get
        the water out of a glass. Well, it is as easy to tap this energy
        now out in space at it will be in a million years from now. If
        it can be done then, it can be done now. </p>
      <p>For me to go into a technical account of how to harness this
        energy, would mean the writing of volumes. The whole thing might
        be said in the few words of Nikola Tesla: "Throughout space
        there is energy. Is this energy static or kinetic? If static our
        hopes are in vain; if kinetic and this we know it is for
        certain, then it is a mere question of time when men will
        succeed in attaching their machinery to the very wheelwork of
        nature." </p>
      <p>This I have been able to do through the use of certain valves
        and oscillators that I have made and of which doctors of science
        have said are the most powerful devices known to science today.
        When an elastic substance is subjected to strain and then set
        free, one of two things happens. The substance may slowly
        recover from the strain and gradually attain its natural state,
        or the elastic recoil may carry it past its position of
        equilibrium and cause it to execute a series of oscillations. In
        ordinary language there may be a continuous flow of energy in
        one direction until the discharge is completed, or an
        oscillating discharge may occur. That is, the first flow may be
        succeeded by a back-rush, as if the first discharge had overrun
        itself and something like a recoil set in. The device thus
        becomes more or less charged again in the opposite sense, and a
        second discharge occurs accompanied by a second back-rush, the
        oscillations going on until the energy is either radiated or
        used up in the heating of the conductors. And if your device
        will oscillate in harmony with the oscillations of the Universe,
        or in other words, if the device is capable of synchronization
        with the vibrations of that energy through space, then the
        oscillations will go on forever. No one can call such an
        arrangement perpetual motion any more than one can call the
        motion of the earth perpetual motion. My device oscillates
        because of the oscillations of the Universe caused by the
        disintegration of matter. </p>
      <p>Extracts from the notes made in 1918 follow, although they may
        in a way repeat what has already been given, but are repeated in
        order not to break the line of thought. </p>
      <p>I fully realize that whatever the difficulties in discovering
        new truths, there are still greater difficulties in getting them
        recognized, for as Mark Twain said, "It takes twenty years to
        get a new idea fixed in the human mind," and I should be armed
        with scant philosophy if I remained for long surprised at the
        attacks of some, or the exasperation of a certain number of
        worthy people, and at the silence of the greater number of
        scholars, who have heard of my experiments. </p>
      <p>Heat, light, etc., are not things in themselves, but sensations
        or effects produced by radiant energy directly or indirectly. </p>
      <p>We speak of generating electricity: To be exact, we only
        transfer it from one place to another, (pump it, if you please).
        We cannot generate it because we can neither create nor destroy
        it.. After we have used it to light our homes or do other work,
        it is like water over the wheel — no less water, only the
        lowering of potential. The electricity has only sunk back from
        whence it came, ready and waiting for nature or man to raise its
        potential, when it again is ready to do man's bidding, or in
        other words in the evolution of energy it sinks back from whence
        it came as it is naturally very slowly but steadily being
        liberated from the ether. Man may by proper means make the
        process of liberation rapid rather than the natural slow way of
        nature. </p>
      <p>I fully realize elements maintain an equilibrium by rotations,
        attractions and repulsions, but this does not interfere with a
        transformation of equilibrium, which when the transformations of
        equilibrium are rapid enough become heat, light and electricity,
        or matter is turning into energy and energy into matter. </p>
      <p>There can be no production of current electricity without an
        interruption of equilibrium. Whatever the quantity of
        electricity it will produce no energy if there is no disturbance
        of equilibrium, that is to say change of potential or electrical
        level. </p>
      <p>When one thinks of the oxygen and nitrogen molecules of the air
        all about us moving with the speed of bullets and striking us
        and everything with this speed, one can form some idea of the
        agitation taking place in the Universe. The oscillations of the
        Universe are a part of this agitation, although some of them are
        from .06 to .0l Angstrom units and shorter, they may be made to
        do the bidding of man. </p>
      <p>The oscillations of these electrons, protons, etc., out there
        in space are emitting electromagnetic waves of many wave lengths
        and frequencies. In the Moray device we have one frequency on
        the high voltage or primary side, and for commercial purposes,
        the device is so constructed that the frequency is very much
        lower on the secondary side. <br>
        I will now go on to the account promised above on the back-rush
        effect of condensers and electromagnetic radiation. </p>
      <p>But first let me state that all radiant energy is now believed
        to possess mass or something equivalent to it. Mass and radiant
        energy are even considered to be interchangeable. I am convinced
        it is active radiations produced in nature's cyclotrons by the
        evolution of matter into energy and energy into matter. </p>
      <p>Ether demanded by Electric Phenomena — an Electric Charge a
        Charge of Energy and an Electric Current a Flow of Energy: To
        account for the propagation of heat and light and other radiant
        energy — we have postulated the existence of a medium filling
        all space. But the transference of the energy of radiant heat
        and light is not the. only evidence we have in favor of the
        existence of such a medium. Electric, magnetic, and
        electromagnetic phenomena (and gravitation itself) point in the
        same direction to gamma rays and the splitting of the atom by
        nature, the evolution of matter and the evolution of forces, or,
        in other words, matter turning into energy and energy into
        matter. </p>
      <p>It is a matter of common observation that attractions and
        repulsions take place between electrified bodies, magnets, and
        circuits conveying electric currents. Large masses may be set in
        motion in this manner and acquire kinetic energy. If an electric
        current be started in any circuit, corresponding induced
        currents spring up in all neighboring conductors; yet there is
        no visible connection between the circuit and the conductors. To
        originate a current in any conductor requires the expenditure of
        energy. How then is the energy propagated from the circuit to
        the conductors? If we believe in the continuity of the
        propagation of energy — that is, if we believe that when it
        disappears at one place and reappears at another, it must have
        passed through the intervening space, and therefore have existed
        there somehow in the meantime — we are forced to postulate a
        Universe filled with matter and energy. </p>
      <p>When a body is electrified, what we must first observe is that
        a certain amount of energy has been spent; work has been done,
        and the result is the electrified state of the body. The process
        of electrifying a conductor is therefore the storing of energy
        in some way in, or around, the conductor in some medium. The
        work is spent in altering the state of the medium, and when the
        body is discharged the medium returns to its original state, and
        the store of energy is involved. Similarly a supply of energy is
        required to maintain an electric current, and the phenomena
        arising from the current are manifestations of the presence of
        this energy in the medium around the circuit. Formerly an
        electrified body was supposed to have something called
        electricity residing upon it which caused the electrical
        phenomena, and an electric current was regarded as a flow of
        electricity travelling along the wire, while the energy which
        appeared at any part of the circuit (if considered at all) was
        supposed to have been conveyed along the wire by the current.
        The existence of induction, however, and electromagnetic actions
        between bodies situated at a distance from each other, lead us
        to look upon the medium around the conductors as playing a very
        important part in the development of the phenomena. It is, in
        fact, the storehouse of the energy. </p>
      <p>Upon this basis Maxwell founded his theory of electricity and
        magnetism, and determined the distribution of the energy in the
        various parts of the field in terms of the electric and magnetic
        forces. The ether around an electrified body is charged with
        energy, and the electrical phenomena are manifestations of this
        energy, and not of an imaginary electric fluid distributed over
        the conductor. When we speak of the charge of an electrified
        conductor we refer to the charge of energy in the ether around
        it, and when we talk of the electric flow or current in a
        circuit we refer to the only flow we know of, viz., the flow of
        energy through the electric field into the wire. </p>
      <p>Now consider the case of a body changed alternately, positively
        and negatively, in rapid succession. The positive charge means a
        positive polarisation of the ether, which begins at the
        conductor and travels out through space. When the body is
        discharged the ether is once more set free and resumes its
        former condition. The negative charge now entails a modification
        of the ether or polarisation in the opposite sense. The result
        of alternate charges of opposite sign is that the ether at any
        point becomes polarised alternately in opposite directions while
        waves of opposite polarisations are propagated through space,
        each carrying energy derived from the source or agent supplying
        the electrification: Here, then, we have a periodic disturbance
        of some kind occurring at each point, accompanied by waves of
        energy travelling outwards from the conductor. </p>
      <p>The phenomena of interference lead to the conclusion that light
        is the result of a periodic disturbance, or vibration, of the
        ether, but as to the nature of the vibration — that is, as to
        the exact nature of the periodic change — or what it is that
        changes, we possess no knowledge. From the foregoing we see that
        alternating electric charges are accompanied by corresponding
        changes of state, or vibrations, and if the charge be varied
        periodically and with sufficient rapidity, we have a vibration
        at each point analogous to, and perhaps identical with, that
        which occurs in propagation of light and of other vibrations
        higher than the gamma rays and beyond. <br>

        <p><b>A SHORT TREATISE ON&nbsp; ALPHA, BETA, GAMMA RAY THERAPY</b>
        </p>
        <p><b>( 1946 )</b> <br>
          <b>by</b> <br>
          <b>DR. T. HENRY MORAY</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>Science acknowledges that bombardment of matter by swift moving
        alpha particles has proven a powerful method of studying
        artificial transformation of the nucleii of a number of the
        ordinary elements. Evidence is also accumulating that by this
        method we are able to cause a disintegration of a nucleus of
        greater mass by capture of the colliding alpha particle. </p>
      <p>The above law applied to therapy and other scientific
        investigation is not beyond possibility. Through the treatment
        of the cells of the human body artificial transformation or
        disintegration may take place. The disintegration of fungi and
        cells gone wild in the body is of value in therapy. Nature can
        then rebuild with new, healthy tissue and cells. That is what is
        attempted in Radium and X-Ray therapy and would be accomplished
        if it were not for the destructive effects of radium and X-ray
        to living cells. By proper screening and applications of proper
        amounts of the fast moving alpha rays as also gamma rays and
        treatment by beta rays (which are electrical in nature) one can
        obtain beneficial effects in many cases. Valuable results can be
        had in therapy on living cells if there is no destruction of
        cells or tissue in trying to effect a cure. </p>
      <p>Because the fundamental radioactive process does not originate
        in the electronic structure of the surface of the atom, but in
        the center of the atom, deep therapy is possible over a long
        period of time with the Moray Cosray applicators. </p>
      <p>It is an accepted fact that the length of day and night is a
        very important factor in the growth and development of most
        plants. The more sensitive plants normally attain their
        flowering and fruiting stages only when the length of day falls
        within certain limits. Some respond to a long day while others
        respond to a short day. That is why we have early and late
        maturing species depending on the length of day to which they
        are exposed. Animal cells react also to light rays and to rays
        beyond the light rays. In this fact we have the basis for light
        and ray therapy in the treatment of human tissue and cells, the
        biological effects from radiations to both animal and vegetable
        cells. There are also effects from radiations on mineral matter.
        Radiations effect pigments, bacteria, fungi and enzymes.
        Radiations induce chromosonial aberrations in animals. One will
        find a real field for therapy advancement in the study of
        radiation absorptions of tissues and the study of mutations in
        animal matter. Modern living away from natural radiations,
        because one is indoors so much of the time away from natural
        radiations, necessitates artificially supplying various rays. In
        ray therapy, the problem is generally that of treating diseased
        tissue below the skin. There are two important problems: First,
        how to effect relief without injury to the skin, healthy cells
        and intervening tissue. Second, how to measure correctly the
        depth dose delivered to the diseased tissue. </p>
      <p>With the Moray Cosray ray applicator one may disregard the
        second problem because that problem does not exist with these
        applicators. The first problem is a question of time as the rays
        from these applicators will penetrate through the human body
        (proven by Geiger Muller Counter tests). These applicators' rays
        will also penetrate 1/2-inch thickness of lead. The above is
        given to show the penetrating power of the rays from, these
        applicators, and yet they will not injure healthy tissues
        because, of 'the internal phantom characteristics built into
        these applicators as a patented feature, and the nature of the
        active material used. The value in therapy of Alpha, Beta and
        especially Gamma rays in the treatment of epithelial cells and
        malignancy is too well known to take the time and space here to
        go into the subject. However, their destructive qualities have
        been their great drawback, destroying, the healthy surrounding
        tissue while treatment is being made of the ailing cells and
        tissue. No special shielding protection is necessary with the
        Moray Cosray applicators. These applicators may be had in any
        shape and size to best conform to the application to which they
        are to be put. </p>
      <p>Too little attention has been paid to the, therapeutic value of
        beta, rays. In most cases great care has been used to filter
        these out. The Moray method, by proper application, makes use in
        some cases of these beta rays to the value of the tissue under
        treatment. </p>
      <p>In all forms of gamma ray therapy doses are expressed in
        Roentgens or "R". In other words, the quantity of gamma
        radiations received in one hour at a distance of one cm. from a
        source containing 1 milligram of radium in a 0.5 mm. platinum
        envelope may be regarded as approximately eight roentgens, or
        eight "R"s., </p>
      <p>Such procedure, means the application of such therapy requires
        the close supervision of an expert. With the Moray Cosray
        applicators no close supervision is necessary as these
        applicators are not so severe in their reaction, yet they have
        deep penetrating properties, as explained, and ray therapy value
        without the danger to the surrounding tissue. </p>
      <p>It has been the purpose of this leaflet to explain in a
        non-technical way a little of the science of radioactive
        phenomena so that users and prospective users of Moray Cosray
        ray applicators (Cosray being a trade mark name) will have some
        idea of the rays these applicators give off. </p>
      <p>In the disintegration of these applicators, alpha, beta and
        gamma rays are emitted. The alpha and beta emanaions are really
        charged particles, since they may be actuated by electric
        fields. Gamma rays, like heat, light and X-rays are
        electromagnetic waves. Alpha particles are positively charged
        helium atoms, but possess much greater: energies than the
        ordinary positive particles. Beta particles are the same cathode
        particles or are electrons, but are much more active, having the
        highest velocities of any substance known. </p>
      <p>The half life of these Cosray applicators is about 1600 years,
        so one can see they will be of therapy value through several
        generations of mankind in the treatment of epithelial cells and
        malignancy where heretofore Radium and X-rays have been the
        recommended treatment. </p>
      <p>These applicators are the discovery and invention of John
        Eugene and Richard R. Moray. </p>
