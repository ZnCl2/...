      <br>
      Dileka is a tube whose length varies depending on the volumes of
      water to be treated: when the water goes through it, it undergoes
      a vortex movement several times; thus the water goes from a
      laminar flow to a swirling flow: this generates a depression and
      micro-bubbles; it also receives infra-red waves produced by very
      specific ceramics placed inside the body of the device: those
      waves are evocative of those waves naturally produced by the earth
      itself. As a result of that mechanical and electro-magnetic energy
      that it receives, the water is strongly agitated and ionised; it
      then acquires new physical properties.<br>

      Founded in 1995 by Veterinarian Dr Hervé JANECEK, our company is
      based in Montpellier in the south of France.<br>
      <br>
      CYTOBIOTECH is a company specialising in Biology and Nutrition,
      with advanced expertise in the area of Bio-energy; since year
      2000, our team’s trade has focused on water treatment, by
      developing in France various innovative technologies intended to
      valorise that unique resource thus our world should be understood
      from a bio-chemistry angle of course, but also from a bio-physics
      angle this is true of the first of our fids, and also the first
      element of our living environment, i.e. water.<br>
      <br>
      Since 2003, CYTOBIOTECH has imported from Japan the DILEKA, which
      was designed and developed by the EKG company and its manager, Mr
      Kikuo TAMURA, architect.<br>
      <br>
      This innovative technique transforms the physical characteristics
      of water by giving back its original energy the food water drunk
      every day by each of us, but also the water used in the industry,
      farming, breeding and services, take advantage of the
      transformation.<br>
      <br>
      DILEKA allows individuals to drink health water and also save on
      detergents, and protect the duct system of their houses from lime
      and oxidation.<br>
      <br>
      DILEKA helps farmers and companies reduce environmental pollutions
      (pesticides, fertilisers, detergents, solvents), and also make
      many productivity and quality savings on the products sold.<br>

      Now through information and by promoting the DILEKA clean towards
      all concerned European players, CYTOBIOTECH’s job is to put the
      economy increasingly at the service of the environment.<br>
      <br>
      CYTOBIOTECH also distributes the PHP, which is also developed by
      EKG, and which allows important energy gains in terms of heating
      and air conditioning.<br>
      <br>
      CYTOBIOTECH is the exclusive importer of the DILEKA ad PHP

        TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
        [0002]<br>
        <br>
        The present invention relates to a configuration in Waterworks,
        in particular the water supply system to make water activated
        running water.<br>
        [0003]<br>
        <br>
        <b>Background technique</b><br>
        <b> </b>[0004]<br>
        <br>
        Landing in the mountains of rain, snow to penetrate from the
        underground springs and groundwater eventually become rivers of
        Origin form.<br>
        <br>
        In this process, this water by far infrared rays from minerals
        or rocks, negative ions, magnetic effect makes hydrogen bond
        clusters of water molecules (Group) split and accepted by the
        collision with the rock, falling from a waterfall and other
        water molecules to each other by friction electrons, thus
        reducing water as water can play a specific function, called a
        water-activated capability (known as "living water", "activated
        water") and well known.<br>
        [0005]<br>
        <br>
        However, the water has not been determined to prove there is a
        scientific basis and get public recognition, for a particular
        member of the treated water, add water, or as a change in
        drinking water when used, although feelings judgment based on
        experience, but it can get a certain degree of extensive good
        the effect is still the facts.<br>
        [0006]<br>
        <br>
        Additionally, this running water extremely difficult to maintain
        for a long time with its active state, so the effect is more
        uneven, so will greatly affect the effectiveness of running
        water if a real effect.<br>
        [0007]<br>
        <br>
        Therefore, Zixi so far, in order to obtain a more efficient
        water activity and maintain it for a long time for the purpose
        of the pipeline inside the device connected to the configuration
        of calcined minerals from the spherical, flat disc-like small
        block of ceramic material (hereafter as "ceramic balls, etc."),
        or use of a static magnetic field formed by water moving through
        a magnetic field space structure of the various devices
        (hereinafter referred to as "flowing water") Now that practical.<br>
        [0008]<br>
        <br>
        For example, it has been revealed to have a means of running
        water, characterized in that a plurality of ceramic balls
        accommodated inside the like, and has a water-passing hole
        formed in the housing can be accommodated between the water
        filling pipe between the cylindrical casing (e.g. see Patent
        Document 1).<br>
        [0009]<br>
        <br>
        In addition, there is a running water system has been revealed,
        which will be formed in the same manner with the invention of
        Patent Document 1 has an approximate circulation holes
        far-infrared radiation ceramic group circled switched to
        multi-layered configuration as to be interposed in charge of
        water pipes, etc. between the housing and formed on the plate by
        the impact of the blade so that the various ceramic disc
        rotation (for example, see Patent Document 2).<br>

        [0014]<br>
        <br>
        <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
        <b> </b>[0015]<br>
        <br>
        Invention is to solve the problem<br>
        [0016]<br>
        <br>
        However, it disclosed a traditional running water due to contact
        with waterways is limited, thus can not be converted to running
        water has sufficient ability to activate the question.<br>
        [0017]<br>
        <br>
        For example, Patent Document 1 running water occurs at a
        position offset ceramic balls, etc., the water pressure loss,
        which results in less fluid or water retention.<br>
        <br>
        In addition, there are long years by the wear between contacting
        ceramic balls like each other caused, due to reduced activation
        effect is reduced, thus the need for the ceramic ball to
        replace, supplement or cleaning and other maintenance issues.<br>
        [0018]<br>
        <br>
        Patent Document 2 running water of the ceramic plate configured
        to rotate to agitate the water, as compared to the ceramic balls
        disposed such circumstances Patent Document 1 or the like, can
        not avoid contact with flowing water relative to the material
        with water is reduced, thus far infrared, negative role in
        influencing the magnetic effect of reducing the danger.<br>
        <br>
        In addition, the impact of the blade is formed with a high
        manufacturing cost ceramic disc, and is used for many years
        still occurs sometimes injury rotating mechanism to maintain the
        rotational state can not, at this time there will function to
        reduce the problem.<br>
        [0019]<br>
        <br>
        In addition, the recent deterioration of water pipes along the
        device, set up the deterioration of the environment, within the
        water of bacteria, such as E. coli, Legionella proliferation
        concerns will have more, and Patent Documents 1 and 2 means no
        running water sterilization, or bacteria proliferation, or only
        a little of the action.<br>
        [0020]<br>
        <br>
        Thus, the present inventors will focus on the above-mentioned
        problems, and aims to provide a limited flow path length can be
        obtained more efficiently and maintain an active state of
        prolonged running water, and obtain a bactericidal or bacterial
        growth inhibitory effect of running water running water ???<br>
        [0021]<br>
        <br>
        <b>Way for Solving the Problems</b><br>
        <b> </b>[0022]<br>
        <br>
        To solve the above problems, the present inventors running water
        has the following composition:<br>
        [0023]<br>
        <br>
        Forming a conductive connection means having an inflow side and
        the outflow side of the cylindrical conductive body, the inflow
        side and the outflow side of the body were filled with external
        water conduit in communication, and to electrical insulation to
        cover the connecting unit and the main body flowing water unit,
        which is formed in the housing in the manner of the body not in
        contact with each other a plurality of configuration components
        running water;; conical front umbrella body, which in this case
        composed of flowing water unit part or all of the conductive
        cover member The inflow-side end portion toward its distal end
        disposed in the inflow direction; and a conical rear section
        umbrella body, disposed on the outflow side end portion of the
        preceding element to running water inflow direction toward the
        front end of the way.<br>
        [0024]<br>
        <br>
        The aforementioned body covered with a ground (through ground).<br>
        <br>
        Thus, the state of the plasma formed in the running water
        (positive ions (+) and electrons (-) ionized state) of the
        positive ions by discharge to ground, while the residual
        electrons (-).<br>
        [0025]<br>
        <br>
        In addition, for the formation of a conical body umbrella, the
        umbrella body front (inflow side umbrella body) in a
        substantially central portion of the front end disposed toward
        the inflow direction of a single, umbrella body while the rear
        section (outflow side of the umbrella body) to the inflow
        direction toward the distal end The way the outflow side to
        configure multiple.<br>
        The front tip of the umbrella body to essentially open angle of
        90 degrees, and the rear section of the front end of an open
        umbrella body angle is set to be substantially 45 degrees.<br>
        <br>
        Further, the open angle of the umbrella body most preferably
        said angle setting, but unless, may also be set to have a width
        slightly.<br>
        [0026]<br>
        <br>
        Preferred examples of either or both of the material of said
        pre-stage and rear stage umbrella umbrella body is formed by a
        body comprising titanium, silver, copper and other antimicrobial
        materials.<br>
        <br>
        The pure metal is preferably formed of a material such umbrella
        bodies, but may also be processed by plating, ion plating or the
        like is formed to cover the surface of the specifications.<br>
        <br>
        In addition, most preferably pure titanium cases of
        specifications.<br>
        [0027]<br>
        <br>
        Flowing water unit in a manner not in contact with each other in
        the direction of flow of cross-sectional configuration of a
        plurality of parts to constitute a layer of flowing water, the
        flow direction and laminated to constitute the laminated shape,
        i.e., a multi-layer configuration.<br>
        [0028]<br>
        <br>
        Arranged in a plurality of layers of flowing water component
        cross section is formed substantially in line with the outer
        diameter of the body, and housed, kept within the basin has a
        through-aqueous holder.<br>
        <br>
        Bottom surface of the retainer with a plurality of fins, the
        fins have inclined to the bottom surface of the water flowing
        through the flow line leaving the role of the change of
        direction.<br>
        <br>
        And more, the inclination of each set arranged more layers of
        each fin retainer together for mutually inclined toward the same
        direction.<br>
        <br>
        In other words, the tilt having the same shape as the plurality
        of fins laminated retainer disposed within the body.<br>
        [0029]<br>
        <br>
        Member by the above-described running water after contact with
        water may produce some action member is formed, and as preferred
        examples, mainly used in multi-element minerals (ceramics,
        artificial tourmaline, etc.) as the main component of the fired
        body, its shape is formed along the the main axis of the housing
        in the direction of the cylindrical axis.<br>
        <br>
        And, there is formed around the outer periphery of the side that
        contains the entire water flow to change direction of the
        concave strip helical groove, helical ridges or peaks strip.<br>
        <br>
        In addition, depending on the demand, or to further enhance the
        functionality for the purpose of running water is formed so that
        the shaft member penetrating the through hole, the inner
        peripheral surface of the through hole may also be formed with
        the outer peripheral surface of the same helical groove and the
        like.<br>
        [0030]<br>
        <br>
        <b>Effect of the Invention</b><br>
        <b> </b>[0031]<br>
        <br>
        Case running water through the invention configured as described
        above, the effect of volatile following features:<br>
        [0032]<br>
        <br>
        First, the water from flowing into the front side of the
        umbrella body of the collision, while the water particles are
        accelerated along the additional rotating conical surface,
        followed by a conical surface when exiting the rear edge of the
        umbrella body, that additional rapid rotation.<br>
        <br>
        Thus, the water particles gathered from the intense vortex flow
        is formed, continuing toward the flowing water is disposed
        behind the mobile unit.<br>
        [0033]<br>
        <br>
        These eddy currents running water after contact with a high
        efficiency unit metamorphism (activation force conversion) to
        form living water.<br>
        <br>
        In detail, the high-speed and flowing water by the member
        contact (water particles high friction slip), form a positive
        charge and the electrons constituting the free state of atoms of
        water molecules.<br>
        <br>
        In this case the state as a plasma or plasma state of vibration.<br>

        More and, when the umbrella body formed from titanium
        alloy-based antimicrobial component, could play ionized water,
        inhibit the proliferation of E. coli, Legionella, etc., or to
        reduce the effect of pesticides.<br>
        <br>
        Extremely effective in improving water quality and other aspects
        of public bathhouse.<br>
        [0035]<br>
        <br>
        In addition, the case has constructed running water quality
        improvement.<br>
        <br>
        I.e., can be reduced or removed (nitrogen compound) as a
        substitute for chloramine and chlorine for disinfection, but
        also confirmed that the effect of reducing the reaction with
        chlorine generated chloroform.<br>
        <br>
        In addition, general chloramine does not generate halogenated
        methane, it does not produce discomfort such as chlorine-like
        odor, so you can improve the taste of tap water, however, in
        terms of monochloramine for ornamental fish is poisonous, and
        for humans , when the water used for artificial dialyzer
        sterilization should also be removed, etc., not only benefits.<br>
        [0036]<br>
        <br>
        And, the acceleration and the acceleration vortex conical
        surface disposed in the rear edge of the rear section of the
        body section of the umbrella can by means of the water flowing
        water, and further through the conical surface generated
        generated, so that running water state is maintained longer and
        to move it in the rear of the line.<br>
        [0037]<br>
        <br>
        More persons, arranged in part due to the flowing water within
        the housing is configured as described above, in the
        configuration in the flow path by forming the outer peripheral
        surface and (or) the inner circumferential surface of the
        through hole of the spiral groove or spiral ridges, running
        water member it increases the surface area in contact with the
        water, and running water pivoting member itself, and produce
        more than a predetermined direction (D-shape in plan view) of
        the vortex along the flow path.<br>
        <br>
        Therefore, the water will be able to increase the contact
        surface area and the vortex of the foregoing and effective
        activation.<br>
        <br>
        In particular, the vortex by water molecules collide with each
        other, the friction produces electronic and promoting
        activation, and therefore contribute to a more efficient
        activation when the limited flow path length.<br>
        [0038]<br>
        <br>
        Further, the flowing water held by the holding member having a
        water flow line can change the configuration of the fin and
        multilayer, whereby the vortex generation region as large as
        possible and to improve the degree of activation, but can be
        maintained for a long running water state.<br>
        [0039]<br>
        <br>
        In addition, the umbrella body segment due to a sharp outflow
        side is arranged to start multiple angles, it can be through the
        housing flows through highly activated stirred further
        additional small vortices, can promote chlorine harmless and
        will receive the traditional means No running water in the
        novel.<br>

        <b> </b><b>[0049]</b><br>
        <b> </b><br>
        Hereinafter, specific embodiments of the present inventors of
        flowing water, will be described in detail based on the
        drawings.<br>
        [0050]<br>
        <br>
        Figure 1 and Figure 2, the flowing water of the present
        embodiment is mainly composed of, we will maintain a plurality
        of components as running water running water unit holder 6 3
        multilayer shape (another state adjacent to the stacked)
        configuration within the interior space of the housing 2 while
        the front body 4 arranged in the upper part of the umbrella unit
        running water side, and the rear section umbrella body 5 is
        disposed in the lower side.<br>
        <br>
        The flowing water is generally used as a tap water pipeline of
        charge 7 are connected in series and buried in the ground, or
        link to, disposed in the middle of building pipelines.<br>
        [0051]<br>
        <br>
        The housing 2 is composed of the following components: the main
        body 21, a metal which is formed to be the length of the
        cylindrical tube; electrically insulating insulation material
        22, which covers substantially the entire surface of the housing
        2 of the outer peripheral surface; and a conductive cover 23,
        the insulating material covering the outer circumferential
        surface 22.<br>
        Further, in both ends of the body 21, so as to cover the opening
        portion of the connecting pipe 24 provided with the way.<br>
        [0052]<br>
        <br>
        The connecting pipe 24 functions as a charge hose connecting
        unit 7, and filling pipe 7 in a watertight closure and link
        status.<br>
        The connecting pipe 24 is mounted to the main body 21, the
        connecting pipe 24 and the covering body between the opposing
        ends of the edge portions 23 of the mount state with a ring of
        electrically insulating insulating ring 25.<br>
        <br>
        Thus, the connecting pipe 24 and the cover 23 will form an
        electrically insulating.<br>
        [0053]<br>
        <br>
        Mounted on the main body 21 of the open end of the connecting
        tube 24 of the inner peripheral surface is engraved with an
        internal thread 24c for charging pipe 7 and water-tightly
        coupled to the latch.<br>

        column of the locking port 32a 32 that is fixed to the holder 3.<br>
        The front top of the head 4 of the umbrella body open angle is
        set to substantially 90 degrees, the diameter of the edge of the
        conical surface in the holder with the bit closer to the center
        of the outer side of the fin 34d 3 having the same size in plan
        view ???<br>
        [0063]<br>
        <br>
        Furthermore, just above the outflow port 24b of the holder 3 is
        disposed in the inner side of the retaining wall and the front
        end 31a toward the inflow direction of a plurality of (in this
        embodiment, four) rear conical section of the umbrella body 5.<br>

        <br>
        Further, in this embodiment, the umbrella body 4 anterior and
        posterior segment umbrella body 5 are made of alloy.<br>
        <br>
        The reason is that titanium contact with the water can play a
        catalytic role, with E. coli, Legionella and other
        sterilization, or bacteria proliferation, and having a chlorine
        ionization function to make it harmless.<br>
        [0065]<br>
        <br>
        Also, with the exception of two umbrella holder has other 4 and
        5 on the outside of the holding section 3 of the 31 are provided
        with one or more of the components running water 6.<br>
        <br>
        Approximate cylindrical body part 6 of the flowing water for the
        multi-element minerals (ceramics, artificial tourmaline, etc.)
        as the main component of cylindrical fired body, pierced through
        hole 62 contains its shaft 61 is formed.<br>
        <br>
        The flowing water member 6 is set to a height dimension than the
        holder 3 is slightly lower coupling post 32, having a diameter
        of approximately half of the holding portion 31 of the radius of
        the through hole 62 is formed slightly larger than the
        connecting column 32.<br>
        [0066]<br>
        <br>
        Further, the outer peripheral surface and the inner
        circumferential surface of the flowing water is formed member 6
        D-shape in plan view (clockwise) of the spiral ridges 63.<br>
        <br>
        By the spiral ridges 63, running water surface area member 6
        will be substantially increased, and the flow of water from
        flowing water above the member 6 (arrow a) forming a
        substantially right-handed bias flow (arrow e).<br>
        <br>
        Further, in this embodiment, the spiral ridges 63 are formed on
        the outer peripheral surface of the ridges or continuous inner
        circumferential surface, but may also be formed discontinuously.<br>
        [0067]<br>
        <br>
        The flowing water above configuration member 6 in the present
        embodiment, the following configuration is maintained in a
        multilayer structure are arranged in the inner space of the
        housing 2 of the respective retainer 26 3,3, ..<br>
        In.<br>
        [0068]<br>
        <br>
        I.e., configured to, via a through hole 62 running water
        coupling member 6 embedded in the holder 32 of the column 31 is
        disposed, and around the inside of the holding wall 31a in a
        manner not in contact with each other to configure a plurality
        of (in this embodiment for six) running water component.<br>
        <br>
        In other words, in the holding portion of the holder 3, to a
        member (6) for flowing water, flowing water in which a plurality
        of members around 6,6, ..<br>
        <br>
        Arranged circumferentially equally divided state.<br>
        [0069]<br>
        <br>
        The case by the flowing water component configuration structure
        6, water will be in the running water is not covered parts of
        the surface 6 contact with each other, in addition, through the
        spiral ridges 63, running water that is part of their own along
        the right direction (clockwise, arrow f) around axis.<br>
        [0070]<br>
        <br>
        [Role]<br>
        [0071]<br>
        <br>
        With the above configuration running water 1 to play the
        following role.<br>
        [0072]<br>
        <br>
        First, the flow of water from flowing into the inlet 24a of the
        housing 2 (arrow a) collide with the front umbrella body 4,
        extend, and accelerate, thereby producing a plurality of eddy
        currents in its extended conical surface edge.<br>
        <br>
        4 umbrella body with the front collision can be suppressed by
        water catalytic role titanium bacterial growth, while the
        chlorine ionization and it harmless.<br>
        <br>
        Additionally, you can look forward to the effect of improving
        the water quality and reduce chloramine (nitrogen compounds),
        humus and other organic matter and chlorine reaction generated
        trihalomethanes.<br>
        [0073]<br>
        <br>
        The experimental results as running water has suppressed the
        proliferation of bacteria E. coli and Legionella, the growth
        inhibitory effect may be mixed to make provisions bacteria stock
        solution of hot water by the present embodiment a confirmation
        performed.<br>
        [0074]<br>
        <br>
        Second, the umbrella body of water flowing through the front
        holding portion 4 and the holder 3 reaches 31 flowing through
        the nozzle in 34, through the rotation of the fins 34a, inner
        fins 34c, the outer fins 34d, coupled with the right-handed
        stream (arrow b), within biased flow (arrow c), the outer bias
        flow (arrow d), bias, they basically generate a plurality of
        right-handed vortex state was, that is, to form a
        right-handed-based component (main component) along multiple
        directions stirring turbulence state.<br>
        [0075]<br>
        <br>
        Turbulent state of the water front collision umbrella body 4 and
        form a vortex generated by the holder 3 produced side and held
        in the second layer below the holding portion holder 3 6
        collision member 31 running water, living water flowing through
        the side parts between 31 and reaches the holding portion.<br>
        <br>
        In this case, the configuration does not contact 6 through the
        respective members to each other and running water formed in the
        outer circumferential surface of the inner circumferential
        surface of the spiral ridges 63, along the right direction about
        its own axis of rotation (arrow f) in the configuration of the

        Thereafter, whenever flows are arranged in multiple layers in
        the interior space of the housing 26 of each holder 3, the same
        effects as described above will be applied to the water.<br>

        [PROBLEMS] To provide a water activation module that enhances
        the frequency of contact with water molecules needed for water
        activation by efficient agitation of through water stream and
        provide a water activation apparatus utilizing the module.
        [MEANS FOR SOLVING PROBLEMS] The water activation module
        comprises a tube body obtained by molding a mixture of
        functional mineral and resin base material; multiple uneven
        areas provided on both the sides of the internal and external
        side faces of the tube body; and multiple through water ports
        provided by opening the side faces of the tube body. Inside the
        tube body of the water activation module, there are disposed
        multiple flow change means mutually coupled in the direction of
        the tube axis, which flow change means when placed in a flow
        path change the flow path of intra-tube stream. The flow change
        means consist of the same material as used for the tube body,
        and are detachably fitted to the internal side face of the tube
        body. The flow change means have multiple flow change blades for
        rotating of fluid flow. The water activation apparatus is built
        by disposing the water activation module of the above structure
        in a tube in such a manner that an interstice capable of forming
        a flow path of fluid is provided between the external side face
        of the module and the internal face wall of the tube.<br>

        <b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
        <b> </b><br>
        The present invention belongs to a field of water activation
        device to be established in a water flow passage such as a water
        supply pipe for water activation, and the present invention
        relates to a water activation piece for use in the flow passage
        of the water activation device, a structural arrangement of the
        water activation piece, and the water activation device using
        the water activation pieces and its structural arrangement.<br>
        <br>
        <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
        <b> </b><br>
        Ground water made from rain and snow that have accumulated in
        mountains and permeated the ground eventually becomes spring
        water and forms head streams of river. During this process,
        either by subdivision of hydrogen bond group (cluster) of water
        molecules caused by infrared rays, negative ion actions, or
        magnetic actions of minerals and rocks, or by receiving the
        electrons generated by the friction among water molecules
        created from collision against rocks or waterfall, the water
        becomes reduced, or namely, activated.<br>
        <br>
        However, the various effects of the activated condition will be
        gradually lost since the activated condition cannot be
        maintained for a long period of time. Due to this, a device
        (hereafter referred to as “water activation device”) has been
        developed for applying the principle of the above-mentioned
        activation process, where the water that is losing its
        activation effects is reactivated by water flow friction which
        is caused by flowing and stirring the service water against
        ball-shaped ceramic baked particles (hereafter referred to as
        “ceramic balls”) arranged in an internal space or magnetic
        fields formed in the internal space.<br>
        <br>
        For example, a water activation device that stores several cases
        in a tubular body which is capable of intervening through the
        flow pipe of the service water has been disclosed where each of
        the cases stores ceramic balls in the internal space and is
        formed with flow holes (for example, see Patent Document 1).<br>
        <br>
        Similar to the invention of Patent Document 1, another water
        activation device has been disclosed (for example, see Patent
        Document 2), where approximated infrared radiation ceramic group
        discs formed with small flow holes are established in multiple
        layers and in a freely rotating manner within a main body where
        the main body is capable of intervening through the flow pipe of
        the service water where each of these ceramic discs are rotated
        by contact wings formed thereon.<br>

        <b>DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
        <b> </b><br>
        <b>Problems to be Solved by the Invention</b><br>
        <b> </b><br>
        However, the limited length of the water passage in the
        conventional water activation device gives rise to problems such
        as insufficiency in activation effect and fails in subdividing
        the water molecules and thus fails in lowering the voltage of
        oxidation-reduction.<br>
        <br>
        For example, in the water activation device in Patent Document
        1, the water flow often becomes sluggish or retained because the
        ceramic balls are unevenly distributed, which results in loss of
        the water pressure. Moreover, the wearing-out of the ceramic
        balls and contacts of the ceramic balls over a long period of
        time reduce the amount of the ceramic balls and cause the
        problems such as reduction of the activation effect and needs of
        maintenance works for replacing the ceramic balls.<br>
        <br>
        In Patent Document 2, since the ceramic disc is rotated to stir
        the water flow, the contact between the water activation
        material and the water is reduced in comparison to that in
        Patent Document 1, which may lead to reduced effects of infrared
        rays, negative ion actions, and magnetic actions. Further, the
        ceramic disc formed with a contact wing thereon is expensive to
        manufacture, and its rotating state cannot be maintained when
        the rotation mechanism becomes damaged from the usage over a
        long period of time, resulting in functional deterioration.<br>
        <br>
        Therefore, in view of such circumstances, the present invention
        is made to provide a water activation piece for use in a flow
        passage which is capable of forming a more efficient water flow
        stirring state for activating water where the water activation
        piece is formed in a simple structure and its flow passage
        length is limited. The present invention further provides an
        arrangement structure of this water activation piece, and a
        water activation device using the water activation piece and its
        arrangement structure.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Means to Solve the Problems</b><br>
        <b> </b><br>
        In order to solve the above-mentioned problems, the water
        activation piece of the present invention is structured as
        follows:<br>
        <br>
        Namely, a water activation piece 4 is a column-like body, for
        example, a circular cylindrical body of predetermined length,
        and is arranged in the water flow passage, and an axis 41 of the
        water activation piece 4 is established in the direction of the
        flow passage, one or more concaves 43 or convexes 43 that
        axially rotate the water activation piece 4 by the flow pressure
        are formed non-continuously or continuously around an outer
        surface of the water activation piece 4.<br>
        <br>
        Further, a through hole 42 that includes the axis 41 is formed
        through this column-like water activation piece 4. Namely, the
        water activation piece 4 is formed as a cylindrical column body
        and the inner surface of this through hole 42 is established in
        the flow passage, and one or more concaves 43 or convexes 43
        that axially rotate the water activation piece 4 are formed on
        the inner surface non-continuously or continuously. These
        concaves or convexes are formed, for example, as spiral grooves
        43, and on both the outer surface and the inner surface, the
        spiral grooves 43 are formed in a rightward rotation
        (clock-wise) manner in plan view.<br>
        <br>
        The arrangement structure of the above-mentioned water
        activation piece 4 with respect to the flow passage is as
        follows:<br>
        <br>
        Namely, it is arranged that one or more water activation pieces
        4 are held in a holder 3 of predetermined structure where the
        axial direction thereof is established along the flow passage in
        such a way that these water activation pieces are not brought
        into contact with each other, and further, multiple layers of
        the holders 3 are established along the flow passage. In the
        holder 3, a plurality of flow openings 34 having wing pieces
        34a, 34c, and 34d for changing the flow lines in the flow
        passage are established in the directions that are approximately
        perpendicular to the flow passage.<br>
        <br>
        In a water activation device 1 related to the present invention,
        the water activation piece 4 of the above structure or the group
        of water activation pieces 4, 4, . . . are established in an
        internal space 26 of the water activation device 1. The water
        activation device 1 is configured by a conductive body 2 having
        an in-flow opening 24a and an out-flow opening 24b, a conductive
        coating body 23 which covers the outer surface of the conductive
        body 2 through insulating material 22. The conductive coating
        body 23 is insulated from a flow pipe 5.<br>
        <br>
        The reference numerals in the parentheses in the claims and in
        the “Means to Solve the Problem” section are those in the
        accompanying drawings for better understanding of the structure
        of this invention, and are not limited to the particular aspect
        in these drawings.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Effect of the Invention</b><br>
        <b> </b><br>
        Since the water activation piece of the present invention has
        the above-mentioned structure, when it is established in the
        flow passage, the surface area where the water activation piece
        and the water flow are brought into contact with each other
        increases and the water activation piece itself axially rotates
        by the concaves or convexes or by the spiral grooves formed on
        the outer surface and (or) the inner surface of the through
        hole, thus, generating multiple swirls in the predetermined
        direction (rightward in plan view) of the flow passage. As a
        consequence, the water flow can increase the surface area as
        noted above where the water activation piece and water flow come
        in contact with one another and achieve an efficient water
        activation effect by the swirl. Especially, since the swirl
        generates electrons caused by the collision and friction between
        the water molecules and prompts the water activation effect, it
        contributes to an even more efficient water activation when the
        length of the flow passage is restricted.<br>
        <br>
        Further, since one or more water activation pieces are held in
        the holder which causes the changes in the flow line of the
        water flow and such activation pieces are established in
        multiple stages, the area that generates the swirls is increased
        accordingly to increase the degree of water activation, where
        the water activation condition can be maintained over a long
        period of time.<br>
        <br>
        The water activation device established with such a water
        activation piece or groups of water activation pieces is
        maintenance free and can achieve an efficient water activation
        effect in a restricted flow passage length unlike the
        conventional device, thereby enabling to remarkably contribute
        to the industry.<br>
        <br>

        is plan view showing the arranged condition of the water
        activation piece within the holder of the water activation
        device in the present embodiment.<br>
        <br>
        First, the water activation piece and the structural arrangement
        of the water activation piece along with the water activation
        device consisting of these pieces and its structure in the
        present embodiment will be explained in detail below.<br>
        <br>
        The water activation device 1 of the present embodiment, as
        shown in FIG. 1 and FIG. 2, is configured by arranging multiple
        stages of holders 3 for holding a plurality of water activation
        pieces 4 in the internal space of the body 2. The water
        activation device 1 is normally connected to the flow pipe 5
        such as a water pipe and established under the ground or is
        connected to a middle of the pipe in a house.<br>
        <br>
        The body 2 is comprised of a main body 21 that is a metallic
        cylindrical pipe formed in a predetermined length, an insulation
        material 22 that is an electrically non-conductive material and
        covers the entire outer surface of the main body 21, and a
        conductive coating body 23 that coats the outer surface of the
        insulation material 22. Moreover, a connecting pipe 24 for
        serially connecting to the flow pipe 5 such as a water pipe is
        connected in a watertight manner at each end of the main body 21
        in a manner to cover the openings thereof. As for the attachment
        of the connecting pipe 24 to the main body 21, an insulation
        ring 25 is intervened in a circular manner between the
        connecting pipe 24 and each end of the coating body 23 that
        faces the connecting pipe 24, thereby electrically insulating
        between the connecting pipe 24 and the coating body 23. Further,
        in an inner surface of the open end of the connecting pipe 24
        attached to the main body 21, an internal screw 24c for
        connecting in a watertight manner to the flow pipe 5 is
        established. One side of this connecting pipe 24 is an in-flow
        opening 24a, and the other side is an out-flow opening 24b.<br>
        <br>
        The body 2 is designed to reduce the pressure damage during the
        water flow by establishing the in-flow opening 24a and the
        out-flow opening 24b as mentioned above along the same straight
        line or same curved line. Further, the water activation device 1
        does not require an earth connection if it is built under the
        ground, however, it is preferable for the coating body 23 to
        have an earth connection if the water activation device is
        established above the ground.<br>
        <br>
        In a cylindrical internal space 26 of the body 2, the holder 3
        mainly made through resin molding is fitted in an inner surface
        of the internal space 26. A plurality of holders 3 are arranged
        in multiple stages continuously on the same axis. The number of
        holders 3 arranged in this manner is properly selected based on
        the amount of water flow and the desired efficiency of the water
        activation.<br>
        <br>
        The holder 3 in this embodiment comprises a disc-like retainer
        31 formed with multiple flow openings 34 in a mesh-like manner,
        a connection column 32 of predetermined height that is
        vertically formed at the center of the retainer 31, a
        cylindrical side wall 33 formed with a taper with an outer
        opening on the top thereof that is lower than the connecting
        column 32 so that the outer edge of the other retainer 31 is
        enclosed by the tapered opening, and three belt-like retaining
        walls 31a formed on the inner side of the side wall 33 in an
        upright manner from the retainer 31, where above components are
        integrally formed.<br>
        <br>
        The holder 3 is capable of holding one or more water activation
        pieces 4 in a predetermined arrangement by the retainer 31, the
        side wall 33, and the retaining wall 31a. In addition, a
        connection column opening 32a of predetermined diameter is
        formed on the top end of the connection column 32, where the
        other holders 3 arranged above and below the holder 3 is fitted
        on the same axis to allow connection of the holders 3 in
        multiple stages.<br>
        <br>
        The in-flow opening 34 of the holder 3 is comprised of a
        plurality of revolving wing pieces 34a that radially extend from
        the connection column 32 and connect to the side wall 33, inner
        rings 34b that connect to the revolving wing pieces 34a in a
        circular direction and is sequentially arranged with the
        connecting column 32 in a concentric circle with a predetermined
        space, an inner wing piece 34c, and two outer wing pieces 34d.
        The dimension of the bottom side of the inner wing piece 34c and
        the outer wing pieces 34d is made slightly longer in height so
        that these pieces protrude downwardly from the side wall 33 and
        the revolving wing piece 34a.<br>
        <br>
        An inclined surface where the water coming from above (arrow a)
        flows in a rightward rotation (clockwise, arrow d) manner in
        plan view is formed on the revolving wing piece 34a. Also, an
        inclined surface for deflecting the water in an inward direction
        (arrow e) is formed on the inner wing piece 34c, and an inclined
        surface for channeling the water in an outward direction (arrow
        f) is formed on the outer wing piece 34d. The inclined surface
        formed on each wing piece 34a, 34c, and 34d individually
        deflects the water flow in the rightward direction, inward
        direction, and outward direction with respect to the internal
        space of the body 2, hence, generating turbulence as a result.<br>
        <br>
        The arrangement and number of the inner wing piece 34c and the
        outer wing piece 34d is not limited to that of the present
        embodiment, and can be properly changed, for example, all of
        them can be the inner wing pieces 34c or all of them can be the
        outer wing pieces 34d, or arrange the inner wing piece 34c at
        the outer peripheral or the outer wing piece 34d at the inner
        peripheral.<br>
        <br>
        The retainer 31 of the holder 3 structured as described above
        holds one or more water activation pieces 4 in a predetermined
        arrangement. The water activation piece 4 is a cylindrical body
        where a burning body using multiple elemental minerals (such as
        ceramic and artificial tourmaline) as a main component and is
        formed with a through hole 42 including an axis 41. The height
        of the water activation piece 4 is slightly lower than the
        connection column 32 of the holder 3, where its diameter is
        about a half of the radius of the retainer 31 and the through
        hole 42 is formed slightly larger than the connection column 32.<br>
        <br>
        Moreover, the outer surface and the inner surface of the water
        activation piece 4 form spiral grooves 43 that are concaved and
        convexed in a rightward rotation (clockwise) manner in plan
        view. By the spiral grooves 43, the surface area of the water
        activation piece 4 increases substantially, and the water flow
        coming from the above the water activation piece 4 (arrow a)
        becomes the rightward deflecting flow (arrow c). In the present
        embodiment, the spiral grooves 43 are formed in a continuous
        manner on the outer surface and inner surface, however, they can
        be formed in a non-continuous manner as well.<br>
        <br>
        The water activation pieces 4 of the above-mentioned structure
        in the present embodiment are held in the arrangement where each
        holder 3, 3 . . . are arranged in multiple stages in the
        internal space 26 of the body 2 as described below. Namely, the
        connection column 32 of the holder 3 goes into the through hole
        42 to fit one water activation piece 4, then, around this
        activation piece, several water activation pieces 4 (six in the
        present embodiment) are arranged inside of the retaining wall
        31a in a manner that they will not contact with one another.
        Namely, one water activation piece 4 is arranged at the center,
        while several other water activation pieces 4, 4 . . . are
        arranged in a circular manner equally around the center water
        activation piece 4.<br>
        <br>
        By the arrangement structure of the water activation piece 4,
        the surfaces of the water activation piece 4 fully contacts with
        the water flow, where the water activation piece 4 itself
        axially rotates in the rightward (clockwise, arrow b) direction
        by the spiral grooves 43.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Effects</b><br>
        <b> </b><br>
        The water activation device 1 using the water activation piece 4
        and the arrangement structure thereof achieve the following
        effects.<br>
        <br>
        First, the incoming water from the in-flow opening 24a of the
        body 2 reaches the retainer 31 while bumping into the water
        activation pieces 4 held in the retainer 31 of the holder 3 and
        passing therethrough. At this time, each water activation piece
        4 axially rotates in the rightward direction (arrow b) at its
        arranged location so that the incoming water becomes a rightward
        (arrow c) deflected flow because it is arranged that the water
        activation pieces 4 will not contact with each other and the
        spiral grooves 43 are formed on the outer surface and the inner
        surface.<br>
        <br>
        Next, the incoming water that has reached the retainer 31 by the
        rightward deflected flow basically generates a plurality of
        rightward swirls, namely, diverse turbulences, when passing
        through the in-flow opening 34, by the revolving wing piece 34a,
        inner wing piece 34c, and outer wing piece 34d which add the
        deflection of the rightward flow (arrow d), the inward deflected
        flow (arrow e), and the outward deflected flow (arrow f) to the
        rightward deflected flow.<br>
        <br>
        The incoming water in such a turbulent state flows out (arrow g)
        from the out-flow opening 24b where the same effects mentioned
        above are added thereto every time it passes through each holder
        3 arranged in the multiple stages in the internal space 26 of
        the body 2.<br>
        <br>
        This outgoing water becomes reduced by subdivision of hydrogen
        bond groups (cluster) of the water molecules caused by infrared
        rays of the water activation piece 4 and by receiving electrons
        generated by the friction between the water molecules, in other
        words, it becomes activated. The degree of the activation is
        high because of the diverse turbulence where several rightward
        swirls are deflected inward and outward, namely, it generates an
        efficient stirring effect, which immediately amplifies an
        electrical charge to raise the state of activation by the
        structure of the water activation pieces 4 and the holder 3 that
        holds these pieces.<br>
        <br>
        In addition to the above-mentioned effect, by fitting the outer
        shape (outer edge) of the holder 3 into the inner surface of the
        internal space 26 of the body 2, all of the incoming water
        passes through the in-flow opening 34 established on the
        retainer 31 of the holder 3 and bumps into the water activation
        pieces 4, thereby amplifying the activation effect. The degree
        of activation can be properly adjusted by increasing or
        decreasing the number of holders 3 arranged in the multiple
        stages.<br>
        <br>
        Further, by establishing the electrical insulation between the
        internal space 26 of the body 2 and the coating body 23, the
        water activation device 1 will function as an electrical double
        layer capacitor, which prevents the deterioration of the
        activation effect caused by the action that the electrons
        generated in the internal space attract positive charges from
        the outside of the body 2, and which is also effective in
        preventing corrosion on the water activation device 1.<br>
        <br>
        <b>FEASIBILITY OF OTHER EMBODIMENTS</b><br>
        <b> </b><br>
        The water activation piece 4 of the above-mentioned embodiment
        is formed with convex and concave spiral grooves 43 on the inner
        surface and outer surface thereof, however, these spiral grooves
        43 can be combined with independent fins (wings).<br>
        <br>
        Also, the water activation piece 4 is a cylindrical body formed
        with the through hole 42 on the axis for axially rotating the
        piece itself, however, a plurality of through holes 42 can be
        formed for one water activation piece 4 (for example, form
        several through holes in an artificial coal manner).<br>
        <br>
        Further, the number of the water activation pieces 4
        incorporated in the holder 3 can be freely increased or
        decreased so long as it can prevent from contacting one another,
        and can change the arrangement of the water activation pieces
        for each of the holders 3 that are established in the multiple
        stages.<br>
        <br>
        In addition to the above, in the present embodiment, the water
        activation device 1 is structured so that the flow pipe 5 and
        body 2 are connected on the same axis, however, it is not
        limited to this embodiment, and for example, it can be
        structured where an in-flow opening and an out-flow opening for
        treated water are established on a cylindrical, calyx-like, or
        rectangular storage tank that is watertight and in proper
        condition that has a smooth inner side for passing the water and
        established with several holders along the flow line (not
        shown).<br>

        <b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
        <b> </b><br>
        This invention relates to a water activation device for
        activating water by directly connecting to water pipes.<br>
        <br>
        <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
        <b> </b><br>
        In the natural world, rain and snow accumulated in the mountains
        permeate the ground and become groundwater. After a while, the
        groundwater becomes spring water and forms the headstream of a
        river. During this process, the water becomes reduced either by
        the subdivision of the hydrogen bond group (cluster) of water
        molecules caused by infrared rays, negative ion actions, or
        magnetic actions of minerals and rocks, or by receiving the
        electrons generated by the friction between water molecules
        created from collision against the rocks or waterfall. The water
        in such condition is called activated water, and various effects
        of the activated condition are gradually lost since the
        activated condition cannot be maintained for a long period of
        time.<br>
        <br>
        Therefore, a water activation device has been developed by
        applying the principle of this activation process, where the
        water losing its activation effect is reactivated by water flow
        friction which is caused by flowing and stirring the city water
        through ceramic baked particles placed in the internal space.<br>
        <br>
        However, the limited length of the water passage in the
        conventional activation process gives rise to problems such as
        insufficiency in activation effect and fails in subdividing the
        water molecules and lowering a voltage of oxidation-reduction.
        Also, in the activation device having a structure that the
        ceramic baking particles are mixed together and collide against
        each other by the water flow, the water flow often becomes
        sluggish because the particles are unevenly distributed, which
        results in losing the water pressure. Moreover, the wearing-out
        of the ceramic baking particles over a long period of time
        reduces the amount of the ceramic baking particles and causes
        problems such as losing the activation effect and requiring
        maintenance works for replacing the ceramic baking particles.<br>
        <br>
        As described in the foregoing, there is a need for a water
        activation device that can overcome the drawbacks of the
        conventional technology.<br>
        <br>
        <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
        <b> </b><br>
        It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide
        a water activation device that can efficiently activates the
        water that has lost the activation effect and maintain its
        activation effect over a long period of time.<br>
        <br>
        It is another object of the present invention to provide a
        structure of water activation device which is capable of easily
        replacing the activation materials.<br>
        <br>
        In order to achieve the above object, in the first aspect of the
        present invention, the water activation device is comprised of:
        a body which is made of conductive material and has an in-flow
        opening and an out-flow opening; a cover member which is made of
        conductive material and covers an outer surface of the body
        through insulation material therebetween and is insulated from
        water pipes; a plurality of holders overlapped with one another
        in an axial direction of the body, each of the holders being
        formed of a retainer having a plurality of flow openings; and a
        plurality of activation material units each being formed in a
        cylindrical lump containing minerals as a main component. The
        plural activation material units are placed in an overlapping
        manner without contacting with one another along a direction of
        a water flow in an internal space of the body.<br>
        <br>
        In the second aspect of the water activation device of the
        present invention, one or more of the activation material units
        are removably held in a holder without contacting with one
        another, and wherein one or more of the holders are removably
        provided in the body.<br>
        <br>
        In the third aspect of the water activation device of the
        present invention, the in-flow opening and the out-flow opening
        are formed in a pipe-like manner along a straight or curved
        center line of the body.<br>
        <br>
        In the fourth aspect of the water activation device of the
        present invention, a plurality of flow openings are formed on a
        retainer of the holder that holds the activation material units,
        and wherein an outer perimeter of the retainer is substantially
        fitted with an inner surface of the internal space of the body.<br>
        <br>
        In the fifth aspect of the water activation device of the
        present invention, the plurality of holders are placed and
        connected with each other in an overlapping manner along a
        straight and curved center line of the body.<br>
        <br>
        In the sixth aspect of the water activation device of the
        present invention, the plurality of flow openings formed on the
        retainer of the holder are comprised of: turning slope surfaces
        for generating deflected flows of water in a turning direction;
        inner slope surfaces for generating deflected flows of water in
        an inner radial direction; and outer slope surfaces for
        generating deflected flows of water in an outer radial
        direction.<br>
        <br>
        The water activation device of the present invention based on
        the above structure is applied as follows. First, the water
        coming from the in-flow opening impinges on the activation
        material units held by the retainer of the holder, passes
        through the activation material units, and reaches the retainer.
        The activation material units or the holders will not be worn
        out because the activation material units are placed so as not
        to contact with one another, and are firmly held on the
        retainers with the pressure of the water flow. As a result, the
        ability of subdividing the hydrogen bond groups (clusters) of
        water molecules based on infrared rays from activation material
        units can be maintained in the internal space of the body over a
        long period of time. Furthermore, since the electrical
        insulation between the internal space of the body and the cover
        member functions as an electric double layer capacitor, the
        electrons generated in the internal space will not attract any
        positive charge from the outside of the body, thus, suppressing
        any damage in the activation process and preventing any electric
        corrosion on the water activation device.<br>
        <br>
        Based on the water flowing to the water activation device, the
        hydrogen bond groups (clusters) of water molecules are
        subdivided by the infrared rays from the activation materials,
        and the electrons are generated from the friction of the water
        molecules to create reduced water within the internal space of
        the body. In other words, the water flows out from the out-flow
        opening has been converted to activated water. Also, by
        adjusting the number of holders that are placed in multiple
        layers, the degree of activation can be adjusted. Further, by
        placing the in-flow opening and out-flow opening along the same
        straight or curved line, pressure loss during the water flow can
        be prevented.<br>
        <br>
        In addition, by fitting the outer perimeter (outer rim) of the
        holder into the inner surface of the internal space, all of the
        flowing water will pass through the flow openings established on
        the retainer of the holder and collide against the activation
        material units, thereby amplifying the activation process.
        Moreover, when the water flows through the turning slope
        surfaces, inner slope surfaces, and outer slope surfaces
        established on the retainer, turbulent flows are generated from
        the turning flows, inner deflected flows, and outer deflected
        flows, exerting stirring effects as well as amplifying a charge
        generation activity.<br>

        <br>
        The water activation device S is mainly comprised of a body 1,
        holders 2, and activation material unit 3. The body 1 is
        composed of a main body 10 having a cylindrical metal tube of a
        predetermined length, insulation material 11 which is electrical
        insulation material and covers almost all of the outer surface
        of the main body 10, and a conductive cover member 12 having a
        tubular shape which covers the insulation material 11 on the
        main body 10. Further, connecting tubes 13 for serially
        connecting to a water flow passage are spirally connected to
        both ends of the main body 10 in a watertight manner to cover
        the openings.<br>
        <br>
        In assembling the connecting tubes 13, electrical insulation
        rings 14 (FIG. 1) are provided between the ends of the cover
        member 12 and the connecting tubes 13, thereby electrically
        insulating therebetween. Inner screws 13c for screw connecting
        to water pipes 4 (FIG. 2) in a watertight manner are provided on
        an inner surface at open ends of the connecting tubes 13
        attached to the main body. One of the connecting tubes 13 works
        as an in-flow opening 13a and the other works as an out-flow
        opening 13b.<br>
        <br>
        One or more holders 2 made through resin molding processes are
        provided in a cylindrical internal space 15 of the body 1 as
        shown in FIGS. 1 and 2. The holder 2 is integrally formed of a
        disc-like retainer 20 having multiple flow openings 23 shaped in
        a net-like manner, a connecting column 21 that is vertically
        installed in the center of the retainer 20 and has a
        predetermined height, and a cylindrical side wall 22 that is
        shorter than the height of the connecting column 21 and
        surrounds an outer edge of the retainer 20, as shown in FIGS. 3
        and 4.<br>
        <br>
        In the retainer 20 of the holder 2 structured as mentioned
        above, one or more activation material units 3 explained
        hereafter are placed around the connecting column 21. Further,
        the plurality of such holders 2 are coaxially placed along the
        internal space 15 of the body 1 so that each connecting column
        21 is joined in a coaxial manner. The activation material units
        3 are preferably placed over the retainer 20 without contacting
        with one another so that the water will evenly flow over the
        surfaces of the activation material units 3. Further, the
        activation material units 3 located between adjoining holders
        (ex. upper holder and lower holder) 2 are preferably placed such
        that two positions on the adjoining holders 2 with respect to a
        center of the column 21 should have a proper angle each other.
        In this example, the activation material units 3 provided on the
        holders 2 are separated by 90[deg.] from one another with
        respect to the column 21. The activation material units 3 in the
        upper or lower holder 2 are positioned by 45[deg.] different
        from those of the center holder 2, which is a half of the
        spacing angle (90[deg.]) between the activation materials on the
        same holder 2.<br>
        <br>
        Moreover, various slope surfaces are formed in the flow openings
        23 of the holder 2 as shown in FIGS. 3-6. In order to generate
        turbulent flows by the deflection of the water flowing through
        the retainer 20, in the flow openings 23, a plurality of slope
        surfaces 23a which are radially formed are tilted (at the side
        of the out-flow opening 13b) towards the turning direction. In
        addition, at the side of the out-flow opening 13b, a plurality
        of inner slope surfaces 23b near the inner side of the flow
        opening 23 are tilted towards an inner direction, and a
        plurality of outer slope surfaces 23c near the outer side of the
        flow opening 23 are tilted towards an outer direction in a
        concentric circle-like manner.<br>
        <br>
        The activation material unit 3 held by the holder 2 as described
        above is a cylindrical pellet-like baked member containing
        multi-element minerals as a main component. The activation
        material unit 3 in this example is approximately as tall as the
        connecting column 21 (FIGS. 1 and 2), and has a diameter of
        about half that of the holder 2. Each bottom part of the
        activation material unit 3 is attached to the retainer 20 of the
        holder 2 such that the four activation material units 3 are
        respectively placed by 90[deg.] apart from the other.<br>
        <br>
        In this example, ground (earth) connection is not necessary
        since the water activation device S is buried underground.
        However, if the water activation device S is installed above the
        ground, the cover member 12 should be preferably grounded.<br>
        <br>
        Operations in the water activation device S of the present
        invention based on the above structure are as follows. First,
        the water coming from the in-flow opening 13a impinges on the
        activation material units 3 held by the retainer 20 of the
        holder 2, passes through the activation material units 3, and
        reaches the retainer 20. The activation material units 3 or the
        adjoining holders 2 will not be worn out from the contact
        because the activation material units 3 are placed so that they
        do not contact with one another, and are firmly held on the
        retainers 20 with the pressure of the water flow. As a result,
        the ability of subdividing the hydrogen bond groups (clusters)
        of water molecules based on infrared rays from activation
        material units 3 can be maintained in the internal space 15 of
        the body 1 over a long period of time.<br>
        <br>
        Moreover, various turbulent flows such as the turning flow a,
        the inner deflected flow b, and the outer deflected flow c are
        generated such as shown in FIGS. 3 and 6 when the water flows
        through the turning slope surfaces 23a, inner slope surfaces
        23b, and outer slope surfaces 23c provided on the retainer 20,
        where the friction and collision of the water molecules generate
        electrons to create reduced water, which flows out as activated
        water from the out-flow opening 13b (FIGS. 1 and 2).<br>
        <br>
        The function of an electric double layer capacitor formed by the
        body 1 and the cover member 12 was evaluated. The measured value
        of internal resistance between the body 1 and cover member 12 is
        600k[Omega]. When charging it by a DC (Direct Current) voltage
        source of 15 volts for three seconds, a voltage of 0.03 V and a
        current of 0.02 mA between the body 1 and the cover member 12
        were observed. As shown in the measurement result of the
        discharge characteristics of FIG. 7, it is known that the
        electrical insulation between the internal space 15 of the body
        1 and the cover member 12 functions as an electric double layer
        capacitor. Consequently, the electrons generated in the internal
        space 15 will not attract positive charges from the outside of
        the body 1, thus not adversely affect the activation process.
        This is also effective in preventing the electrical corrosion on
        the water activation device S.<br>
        <br>
        FIG. 8 shows a measurement result of the electric charge
        characteristics relative to the amount of water flowing through
        the water activation device S. It should be noted that a large
        amount of electric charge is generated within the amount of
        ordinary city water. The number of the holders 2 as well as the
        size and shape of the activation material units 3 can be
        modified because the length of the internal space 15 of the
        water activation device S is also optional. Further, the
        positions and the number of the activation material units 3 per
        every holder 2 can be appropriately changed.<br>
        <br>
        Further, in the above embodiment, the water pipe 4 and body 1
        are coaxially connected. However, the water activation device of
        the present invention is not limited to such a particular
        configuration. For example, although not shown, a storage tank
        with a properly watertight form such as a cylinder, calyx, or
        rectangular box can be established with an in-flow opening and
        an out-flow opening to connect the water activation device of
        the present invention so that the water to be treated can flow
        through. The inside of the storage tank can be smoothly
        structured and several holders can be placed in a stream line
        manner.<br>
        <br>
        As has been described, according to the water activation device
        of the present invention, the hydrogen bond groups (clusters) of
        water molecules can be subdivided by infrared rays coming from
        the activation material held in the holder of the internal space
        of the body. Further, the water can be efficiently activated,
        resulting in remarkable effects since reduced water is produced
        by the electrons which are generated from the friction and
        collision of the water molecules caused by various turbulent
        flows created by the water flowing through the retainer of the
        holder.<br>
        <br>
        Although the invention is described herein with reference to the
        preferred embodiments, one skilled in the art will readily
        appreciate that various modifications and variations may be made
        without departing from the spirit and the scope of the present
        invention. Such modifications and variations are considered to
        be within the purview and scope of the appended claims and their
        equivalents.<br>

        <b>Field of the Invention</b><br>

        [0001] The present invention relates to the field of water
        activation apparatuses to be installed in waterworks for
        activation of tap water and, in particular, to a water
        activation apparatus having a structure that cannot limit the
        installation site thereof with no reduction in the ability to
        produce activated water.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Background of the Invention</b><br>
        <b> </b><br>
        [0002] Rainfall and/or snowfall in mountain areas seep
        underground to become groundwater and, in due course, to become
        spring water to form headwaters. In this process, the water
        becomes reduced, that is, activated by being subjected to the
        action of far-infrared, negative ions, and/or magnetism by
        minerals and rocks so that hydrogen-bonded clusters in water
        molecules are segmentalized or by receiving negative ions
        (electrons) due to friction between water molecules such as
        collisions against rocks and falling from waterfalls.<br>
        <br>
        [0003] However, such an activated state of water is not
        maintained for a very long time, resulting in gradual loss of
        various effects of activated water. For this reason, there have
        conventionally been put into practical use apparatuses
        (hereinafter referred to as "water activation apparatuses") that
        apply the principle of the water activation effect above to
        reactivate tap water that has lost its activation effect by
        arranging ball-shaped fired ceramic particles (hereinafter
        referred to as "ceramic balls") or generating a magnetic field
        in the internal space of the apparatus and by passing and
        agitating water through the space to achieve water-flow-induced
        friction.<br>
        <br>
        [0004] For example, there is disclosed a water activation
        apparatus in which multiple cases each having ceramic balls
        therein and formed with a water passage hole are housed in a
        cylindrical chassis that can be interposed into a tap water
        passage pipe (refer to Patent Document 1, for example).<br>
        <br>
        [0005] In addition, there is also disclosed a water activation
        apparatus in which a group of approximate far-infrared radiation
        ceramic boards each formed with passage pores are arranged
        rotatably and in a multilayer manner in a chassis that can be
        interposed into a tap water passage pipe or the like, as is the
        case with the invention of Patent Document 1, and in which the
        ceramic boards are rotated by collision blades formed thereon
        (refer to Patent Document 2, for example).<br>

        [0006] However, the water activation apparatuses described in
        the foregoing patent documents must adopt a chassis composed of
        a hard material such as metal having a certain length for
        structural reasons such as water activation and maintaining such
        an activated state of water for long periods of time. Therefore,
        an appropriate amount of space is required to install such an
        apparatus, resulting in limiting the installation site thereof.
        That is, conventional water activation apparatuses include an
        inflexible chassis and thereby have no flexibility in securing
        an installation space, whereby at sites with limited space such
        as existing bathrooms including a toilet and a shower, not only
        is it difficult to install quickly, but also large-scale
        installation works may be required or the installation itself
        may have to be abandoned when it cannot be obtained.<br>
        <br>
        [0007] Also, with certain existing apparatuses that use
        activated water, such as bathrooms with a shower and a washing
        machine, it may be preferable to increase the temperature of the
        activated water. From the perspective of space securement,
        however, it is very difficult to install not only a water
        activation apparatus but also a heating apparatus in a pipe
        conduit to such existing apparatuses or in an internal reservoir
        tank.<br>
        <br>
        [0008] Hence, the present invention has been made to solve the
        above-described problems, and an object thereof is to provide a
        water activation apparatus having a limited flow path length yet
        with an efficient water activation effect of segmentalizing
        hydrogen-bonded clusters in water molecules and a heating effect
        as well as having a structure quickly and easily installable
        also in existing water supply facilities.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Means for Solving the Problems</b><br>
        <b> </b><br>
        [0009] In order to solve the above-described problems, the
        present invention is directed to a water activation apparatus
        arranged as follows. That is, the water activation apparatus
        includes: a flexible pipe body (2) with at least the inner pipe
        wall (21) thereof being electrically isolated; and multiple
        water activation pieces (3) arranged in series within and along
        the pipe body, the water activation pieces each being composed
        mainly of a mineral and molded into a contour shape loosely
        fittable inside the pipe body. Loosely fittable inside the pipe
        body means in other words that the outer peripheral surface of
        each water activation piece (3) approximately fitted inside the
        pipe is separated from the inner pipe wall (21) of the pipe body
        with a predetermined gap.<br>
        <br>
        [0010] The water activation pieces (3) may each be arranged in
        such a manner as to have a columnar shape with a predetermined
        length and that the outer peripheral surface thereof is formed
        with one or more discontinuous or continuous rifling patterns
        (33) for turning water flow. Also, the water activation pieces
        (3) may each be arranged in such a manner as to have a water
        passage port (32) formed in a penetrating manner in a water
        passage direction. Further, the water activation pieces (3) may
        each be arranged in such a manner that the inner peripheral
        surface of the water passage port (32) is formed with one or
        more discontinuous or continuous rifling patterns (33) for
        turning water flow. With these additional arrangements, more
        efficient effects of the present invention can be expected.<br>
        <br>
        [0011] Next, in view of contact or collision between multiple
        water activation pieces arranged in series, buffer means (4) may
        be provided integrally or separately at each portion where
        adjacent water activation pieces (3) are in contact with each
        other. In the case of arranging the buffer means, buffer
        materials may be provided integrally with each water activation
        piece (3) at the contact portions (both end portions if in a
        columnar shape) of the water activation piece (3).
        Alternatively, a spacer (4) composed of a member having a
        buffering feature (e.g. elastic member) may be arranged as
        buffer means (4) separately from each water activation piece
        (3). Such a spacer (4) may be interposed for every multiple
        water activation piece depending on the degree of buffering
        required, though it is preferable to arrange for every one water
        activation piece.<br>
        <br>
        [0012] Specific examples of such a spacer (4) include: an
        approximately disk-shaped one formed with an opening (41) and a
        slit (42) for permitting water passage therethrough; and
        multiple cut pieces or ball-shaped ones arranged in such a
        manner as to come into contact with each water activation piece
        (3) and not to block water passage.<br>
        <br>
        Thus installing buffer means (or buffer members) allows the
        water activation pieces (3) to be moved smoothly when the pipe
        body (2) is bent, and can also absorb impact to the water
        activation pieces (3) due to a water hammer phenomenon as well
        as prevent the water activation pieces (3) from being damaged
        and/or abraded by continuous or intermittent contact
        therebetween.<br>
        <br>
        [0013] It is more preferable that the water activation pieces
        (3) are each arranged in such a manner as to have a columnar
        shape with a predetermined length and that the outer peripheral
        surface thereof is formed with one or more continuous rifling
        patterns (33) for turning water flow when the axis (31) of the
        columnar body is positioned parallel to the water flow. In
        addition, the rifling patterns (33) are formed clockwise when
        viewed from the upstream side.<br>
        <br>
        [0014] In addition to the arrangement above, the water
        activation pieces (3) are each arranged in such a manner as to
        have a water passage port (32) including the axis (31) bored in
        the columnar body and that the inner peripheral surface of the
        water passage port (32) is formed with one or more discontinuous
        or continuous rifling patterns (33) for turning water flow when
        the axis (31) of the columnar body is positioned parallel to the
        water flow. The rifling patterns (33) are also preferably formed
        clockwise in the water passage port (32), as is the case with
        the rifling patterns (33) on the outer peripheral surface.<br>
        <br>
        [0015] The outer pipe wall (24) of the flexible pipe body (2)
        may be applied with a coating compound (24a) composed of one or
        more materials selected from graphite and minerals. The coating
        compound (24a) is used to emit growth light, part of
        far-infrared radiation, circumferentially through graphite
        and/or minerals as main raw materials, having a function of
        converting vibration energy of flowing water, which is rotated
        and turned through the water activation pieces (3) within the
        pipe body (2), into thermal energy.<br>
        <br>
        [0016] In addition to the application of the coating compound
        (24a), the entire pipe body (2) may further be covered with a
        flexible tube (6) containing the same materials as the coating
        compound (24a) for emitting growth light. Thus being covered
        with the flexible tube (6) allows the conversion efficiency from
        vibration energy of flowing water passing through the pipe body
        (2) into thermal energy to be further improved.<br>
        <br>
        [0017] The thus arranged water activation apparatus (1)
        according to the present invention includes electricity removing
        means (5) arranged in the pipe body (2). The electricity
        removing means (5) is preferably arranged at the terminal part
        on the downstream side of the water activation apparatus (1).<br>
        <br>
        [0018] The electricity removing means (5) includes: a conductive
        chassis (51) having an inflow port (54a) and an outflow port
        (55a); a conductive covering body (53) including an insulation
        material (52) for covering the outer periphery of the chassis
        (51) and electrically isolated from a water passage pipe (7);
        and water activation pieces (3) each composed mainly of a
        mineral, in which the multiple water activation pieces (3) are
        arranged in series without being in contact with each other
        along the water passage direction of the chassis (51).<br>
        <br>
        [0019] In addition, water activation pieces (3) arranged within
        the electricity removing means (5) have the same form as that of
        water activation pieces (3) arranged within the pipe body.--&gt;<br>
        <br>
        [0020] Also, the reference numerals in parentheses used in the
        Claims and the foregoing Means for Solving the Problems are
        added as reference based on the reference numerals in the
        accompanying drawings to facilitate understanding of the
        arrangements of the invention, and it is a matter of course that
        the arrangements of the invention should not be limited to the
        configurations in the drawings.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Effects of the Invention</b><br>
        <br>
        [0021] In the water activation apparatus according to the
        present invention, the pipe body has flexibility, that is, a
        feature bendable to a predetermined curvature by, for example,
        being formed into a so-called accordion-like shape and/or
        composed of an elastic material, which offers greater
        flexibility in pipe conduit design, though pipes often have
        their respective complex configurations at every installation
        site, as well as exhibiting an effect of allowing for flexible
        and impromptu handling for each field site. It is therefore
        possible to install such an apparatus quickly with no
        large-scale installation work even at installation sites where
        quick installation has conventionally been difficult.<br>
        <br>
        [0022] Also, as for the water activation pieces arranged inside
        the water activation apparatus, the rifling patterns formed on
        the outer peripheral surface and (or) the inner peripheral
        surface of the water passage port cause the surface area with
        which flowing water comes into contact to be increased as well
        as the flowing water to be turned, resulting in a clockwise
        vortex flow when viewed from the upstream side in the present
        invention. Consequently, the flowing water can be in contact
        with the water activation pieces through an increased contact
        surface area and activated efficiently under the vortex flow
        state. In particular, vortex flow promotes water activation
        induced by negative ionization due to collision and friction
        between water molecules, which can achieve efficient water
        activation even if the flow path length may be limited and/or
        the entire flow path may be bent.<br>
        <br>
        [0023] Further, in the water activation apparatus, the outer
        pipe wall of the pipe body may be applied with a coating
        compound composed mainly of graphite and/or minerals or may be
        covered with a flexible tube containing graphite and/or
        minerals. The coating compound and the flexible tube have an
        effect of emitting growth light, part of far-infrared radiation,
        circumferentially, converting vibration energy of flowing water,
        which is in a vortex flow state within the pipe body,
        efficiently into thermal energy, and heating the flowing water.
        This heating effect allows for flexible installation also into
        existing apparatuses that require heating of water, such as
        bathrooms with a shower and a washing machine, with no
        additional heating device, whereby flowing water can be
        activated as well as heated. In particular, apparatuses
        including a circulation type reservoir tank can achieve an
        improved heating effect because flowing water passes through the
        pipe body multiple times.<br>
        <br>
        [0024] In addition, the water activation apparatus includes
        electricity removing means. The electricity removing means is
        adopted to ground and remove positive ions in flowing water that
        are ionized through contact with the water activation pieces.
        Thus installing the electricity removing means promotes negative
        ionization of flowing water passing through the water activation
        apparatus and thereby lowers its redox potential accordingly,
        exhibiting an effect of achieving more efficient water
        activation.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention</b><br>
        <b> </b><br>
        [0025] Specific embodiments of a water activation apparatus 1
        (hereinafter referred to as "present apparatus") according to
        the present invention will hereinafter be described in detail
        with reference to the accompanying drawings. Fig.1 is a
        perspective view of the present apparatus partially cut away;
        Fig.2 is a vertical cross-sectional view of the present
        apparatus; Fig. 3 is an assembled perspective view of the
        present apparatus; Fig.4 is a perspective view of the present
        apparatus partially cut away; and Fig.5 is a perspective view of
        electricity removing means in the present apparatus partially
        cut away.<br>
        <br>
        [0026] As shown in Figs.1 and 2, the present apparatus 1 has an
        arrangement that multiple water activation pieces 3 are arranged
        in series in the internal space 23 of and along the pipe body 2.
        Also, a spacer 4 as buffer means is arranged in an interposed
        manner for every one water activation piece 3.<br>
        <br>
        [0027] The present apparatus 1 is normally to be installed in
        the middle of pipe conduits at sites with limited space to have
        a reduced freedom of installation, such as meter boxes in
        apartment buildings and kitchens and unit bathrooms in houses.
        The present apparatus 1 is also to be installed additionally
        into pipe conduits on existing apparatuses that require heating
        of water used, such as reservoir tanks in bathrooms with a
        shower and a washing machine. In addition, in this description,
        the arrow "a" indicates a water flow direction from a water
        supply valve or the like, and the upstream and downstream sides
        are defined based on the water flow direction.<br>
        <br>
        [0028] The pipe body 2 has a parallel wavy structure formed on a
        side surface of a material having electrical insulation and
        elasticity, such as nylon, to have a flexibility. Also, joints
        22 for connection with a water passage pipe 7 and electricity
        removing means 5 to be described hereinafter are disposed at
        both end portions of the pipe body 2.<br>
        <br>
        [0029] Each joint 22 includes: a socket 22a for water-tight
        connection (screwing in the present embodiment) with the water
        passage pipe 7 or electricity removing means 5; an insert 22b
        with one end being engaged with the socket 22a while the other
        end being fitted into the pipe body 2; and a holder 22c fitted
        around the outer periphery of the insert 22b to hold the pipe
        body 2. The joints 22 are not limited to the arrangement above
        and existing techniques may be selected and utilized
        appropriately as long as they can be maintained and connected
        water-tightly with the pipe body 2. For example, quick couplers
        may be adopted.<br>
        <br>
        [0030] Next, multiple water activation pieces 3, 3, 3, ... are
        arranged in series in the internal space (pipe conduit) 23 of
        and along the pipe body 2 with spacers 4 as buffer means being
        interposed therebetween. Each water activation piece 3 is a
        burned substance (ceramic) molded by containing, for example,
        multi-element minerals (minerals containing silicon mainly and
        many other elements in a balanced manner) and artificial
        tourmalines as major ingredients, and the exterior thereof has a
        contour shape loosely fittable to the inner pipe wall 21 of the
        pipe body 2 while the entirety thereof has an approximately
        cylindrical shape with a water passage port 32 including an axis
        31 bored. Loosely fittable to the inner pipe wall 21 of the pipe
        body 2 means in other words that a small gap is secured between
        each piece and the inner pipe wall 21 of the pipe body 2 on its
        lateral cross-sectional view.<br>
        <br>
        Also, the outer and inner peripheral surfaces of each water
        activation piece 3 are formed with rifling patterns 33 for
        turning water flow when the axis 31 is positioned parallel to
        the water flow. These rifling patterns 33 are formed clockwise
        when viewed from the upstream side. In addition, the rifling
        patterns 33 may be formed discontinuously on the outer or inner
        peripheral surface, though continuous in the present embodiment.<br>
        <br>
        [0031] The rifling patterns 33 cause the surface area of each
        water activation piece 3 to be increased substantially as well
        as the water flow (indicated by the arrow "a") from the upstream
        side of the water activation piece 3 to be turned clockwise
        (indicated by the arrow "b"). Meanwhile, the technical reason
        for which the rifling patterns 33 are formed clockwise is that
        it is empirically and experimentally recognized that turning
        flowing water clockwise increases its water activation effect.<br>
        <br>
        [0032] Each spacer 4 interposed between water activation pieces
        is composed of a synthetic resin material having flexibility and
        elasticity to serve as buffer means for the water activation
        pieces 3. Also, a small gap is secured between each spacer 4 and
        the inner pipe wall 21 of the pipe body 2. Each spacer 4 has a
        disk shape with a contour shape slightly greater than that of
        each water activation piece 3, and is formed with an opening 41
        at the center thereof and eight radial slits 42 communicating
        with the outer edge portion.<br>
        <br>
        [0033] The arrangement of each spacer 4, that is, having a
        contour shape greater than that of each water activation piece 3
        prevents water activation pieces 3 arranged on either side
        thereof from being brought into contact with each other, and
        forming the opening 41 and slits 42 secures a smooth water
        passage state.<br>
        <br>
        In addition, the spacers 4 are preferably arranged for every one
        piece to serve as means for securing a bent state of the pipe
        body 2, for preventing contact between water activation pieces
        3, and for absorbing impact to the water activation pieces 3 due
        to a water hammer phenomenon, but may be arranged for every
        multiple piece. Also, the shape of each spacer is not limited to
        disk shape, and may be formed into multiple cut pieces or ball
        shapes. In this case, the spacers are preferably installed
        directly at the upper and lower end faces of each water
        activation piece 3.<br>
        <br>
        [0034] The thus arranged present apparatus 1 may further be
        arranged in such a manner as to add the following arrangements
        to the pipe body 2 as appropriate. That is, as shown in Fig.4,
        the surface of the outer pipe wall 24 of the pipe body 2 may be
        applied with a coating compound 24a composed of one or more
        materials selected from graphite and minerals. In addition, the
        minerals include sedimentary conglomerates such as graphite
        silica.<br>
        <br>
        [0035] The coating compound 24a emits growth light
        circumferentially. Here, growth light, which is an
        electromagnetic wave belonging to a wavelength range of 6 to 14
        m of far-infrared, has a "resonance absorption effect" by which
        the vibration of molecules in objects exposed thereto is
        amplified, and this amplified vibration causes friction increase
        between molecules to thereby generate frictional heat. In other
        words, growth light has a function of converting vibration
        energy of objects exposed thereto (flowing water) into thermal
        energy to heat it.<br>
        <br>
        [0036] The entire pipe body 2 may also be covered with a
        flexible nylon tube 6 containing one or more materials selected
        from graphite and minerals for emitting growth light to improve
        the efficiency of the heating function above. The surface of the
        flexible tube 6 may be applied with a coating compound composed
        of the foregoing materials. In addition, existing apparatuses to
        install the present apparatus 1 adopting such a pipe body 2
        include ones that require heating of flowing water, such as
        bathrooms with a shower and a washing machine.<br>
        <br>
        [0037] The electricity removing means 5 is arranged at the
        terminal part on the downstream side of the present apparatus 1.
        The electricity removing means 5 includes a conductive chassis
        51 composed of a hard material, and in the internal space 57 of
        the chassis 51, multiple water activation pieces 3 having the
        arrangements above are arranged in series with spacers 4 being
        interposed therebetween.<br>
        <br>
        [0038] The chassis 51 is formed by covering approximately the
        entire outer peripheral surface of a metal cylindrical tube
        having a predetermined length with an electrically insulating
        material 52 and covering the outer peripheral surface of the
        insulating material 52 with a conductive tubular covering body
        53. The covering body 53 is provided with a ground terminal 53a
        for grounding positive ions generated in the present apparatus
        1.<br>
        <br>
        [0039] Further, connection tubes 54 and 55 are fitted to both
        ends of the chassis 51 to cap the openings water-tightly. This
        fitting is specified in that electrically insulating rings 56
        are fitted between the connection tubes 54 and 55 and the
        corresponding both end portions of the covering body 53 so that
        the connection tubes 54 and 55 are electrically isolated from
        the covering body 53. The connection tubes 54 and 55 are
        connected in series, respectively, with the present apparatus 1
        and the water passage pipe 7, and inflow and outflow ports 54a
        and 55a are formed on the respective upstream and downstream
        sides.<br>
        <br>
        [0040] In the connection tube 54 on the inflow port side, a male
        thread 54b for screwing and connecting into one joint 22 of the
        present apparatus 1 is engraved on the outer peripheral surface
        of the open end thereof. Meanwhile, in the connection tube 55 on
        the outflow port side, a female thread 55b for screwing and
        connecting the water passage pipe 7 is engraved on the inner
        peripheral surface of the open end thereof.<br>
        <br>
        [0041] In the cylindrical internal space 57 of the chassis 51,
        multiple water activation pieces 3, 3, 3, ... (four pieces in
        the present embodiment) are arranged, the same as those arranged
        within the pipe body 2 of the present apparatus 1. Also, spacers
        4 are interposed between water activation pieces 3, as is the
        case with the present apparatus 1.<br>
        <br>
        [0042] The electricity removing means 5 is preferably installed
        additionally, though not an essential component of the present
        apparatus 1, because it exhibits an effect of grounding and
        removing positive ions in flowing water that are ionized through
        contact with the water activation pieces 3 and accordingly
        increases the ratio of negative ions in the flowing water to
        further improve its water activation effect.<br>
        <br>
        [0043] Since the present apparatus 1 is thus arranged, the
        flexible pipe body 2 can be bent between water activation pieces
        3 arranged in the internal space 23, and therefore the present
        apparatus can take on various bent states as a whole to have the
        same feature as so-called flexible tubes. Also, spacers 4 are
        arranged between the water activation pieces, which can prevent
        the water activation pieces 3 from being abraded by mutual
        contact therebetween as well as absorb impact to the water
        activation pieces 3 due to a water hammer phenomenon.<br>
        <br>
        [0044] In addition, when inflow water (indicated by the arrow
        "a") through the joint 22 of the pipe body 2 passes through the
        water activation pieces 3, the flow direction is turned
        clockwise (indicated by the arrow "b") by the rifling patterns
        33 formed on the outer peripheral surface of the pieces and the
        inner peripheral surface of the water passage port 32. Then, the
        inflow water is turned at every passage through each water
        activation piece 3 to take on a clockwise vortex flow state in
        the pipe body and then discharged as outflow water.<br>
        <br>
        [0045] The outflow water becomes reduced, that is, takes on a
        so-called activated state by being subjected to the action of
        far-infrared from the water activation pieces 3 so that
        hydrogen-bonded clusters in water molecules are segmentalized
        and by receiving negative ions generated efficiently due to
        collision and/or friction between the thus segmentalized water
        molecules.<br>
        <br>
        [0046] The pipe body 2 exhibits not only a flowing water
        activation effect but also a heating effect if not only applied
        with a coating compound 24a for emitting growth light but also
        covered with a flexible tube 6.<br>
        <br>
        Further, since the electricity removing means 5 is installed to
        ground positive ions generated within the pipe body, the water
        activation effect is further improved.<br>
        <br>
        [0047] Incidentally, activated water generated through the
        present apparatus 1 obtains various effects as follows.<br>
        <br>
        For example, obtained is a test result where the quality of tap
        water with a common bacteria concentration of 530 counts/ml and
        a coliform detection is positive was improved significantly,
        after about a two-week installation of the present apparatus 1,
        to a common bacteria concentration of zero counts/ml and
        coliform was not detectable. There has also been obtained a test
        result of a water-softening tendency in which the hardness of
        water decreased from 94ppm to less than 10ppm after about a
        one-month installation of the present apparatus 1 into a
        drinking water pipe conduit.<br>
        <br>
        Thus, the use of activated water treated through the present
        apparatus has potential for enhancement of cooking flavors and
        efficacy for the human body such as making skin beautiful and
        moisturized. There has further been found a cleaning effect
        without the need for chemical cleaner, which is currently
        attracting significant attention.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Other Possible Embodiments</b><br>
        <br>
        [0048] Although the present apparatus 1 adopts a pipe body 2
        having electrical insulation, it is only required that the inner
        pipe wall 21 of the pipe body 2 has electrical insulation, and
        therefore a metal blade may be fitted around the pipe body 2,
        for example, to improve the protection of the pipe body 2. In
        this case, the blade is preferably grounded through a ground
        terminal.<br>
        <br>
        [0049] In addition, although the water activation pieces 3 are
        each formed with concavo-convex rifling patterns 33 on the outer
        and inner peripheral surfaces thereof, the rifling patterns 33
        may be composed of a combination of so-called individual fins.
        Further, multiple water passage ports 32 may be bored for each
        water activation piece 3 (e.g. multiple water passage ports may
        be formed as in artificial coal).<br>

        [PROBLEMS] To provide a circulation-type active water production
        apparatus that produces active water in a highly active state,
        can store a large amount of the active water while maintaining
        the highly active state, and can supply the stored active water
        at a proper time. [MEANS FOR SOLVING PROBLEMS] The
        circulation-type active water production apparatus comprises a
        water storage tank (2) having, on its bottom side, a water
        discharge port (23) for discharging water along clockwise
        whirling vortex flow in top view, a water pipe (3) for feeding
        water from the water discharge port in the water storage tank to
        a water activation apparatus (5) by water feed means (4), a
        feed-water pipe (7) for feeding the water treated in the water
        activation apparatus to the water storage tank, and a water
        discharge nozzle (8); connected from the feed-water pipe to the
        upper part side within the water storage tank, for discharging
        the water in such a direction that promotes the formation of the
        same clockwise whirling vortex flow in the water stored in the
        water storage tank. An air nozzle (24) for discharging air
        bubbles, which is likewise whirled clockwise, to a part around
        the water discharge port is provided, and branch means (6) is
        provided along the water pipe, for branching water flow
        circulated through the pathway. A water activation material is
        disposed within the water activation apparatus. The water
        activation material is a ceramic material composed mainly of a
        specific mineral.<br>
