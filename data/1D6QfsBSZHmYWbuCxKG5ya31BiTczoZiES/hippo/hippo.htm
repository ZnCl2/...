      <p>Millions of people worldwide are forced to walk long distances
        on a daily basis to collect their water requirements for the
        day. Traditional methods of collecting water include the use of
        20-liter (5-gallon) buckets, which are laboriously carried on
        the head. Extensive suffering occurs in the process. </p>
      <p>This method is very time and energy consuming and is also the
        cause of many serious health problems. </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;">The drum is
        manufactured from UV stabilized Polyethylene and has been
        designed to withstand typical rural conditions such as uneven
        footpaths, rocks and even broken bottles. </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;">The large
        opening (135 mm / 5.3 inch diameter) allows for easy filling and
        cleaning of the interior. The sealed lid ensures hygienic
        storage of water and the steel handle provides firm control over
        difficult terrain while pushing or pulling the roller. </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;">The innovative
        design allows water to be placed inside the "wheel" rather than
        carried above the wheel. The 90kg (200 pound) weight of water is
        borne on the ground resulting in an effective weight of just
        10kg (22 pounds) on level ground. Children and the elderly can
        easily manage a full roller over most types of terrain.
        Extensive field tests over many years and various awards have
        proven the effectiveness of the Hippo Water Roller.
        Approximately five times the normal amount of water can now be
        collected in less time with far less effort. </p>

      <p>CNN World News anchorman introduces the Hippo Water Roller
        Project in South Africa. </p>
      <p>“It (water) is the nation’s most vital resource, and yet, for
        more than 15 million people it’s not on tap in the home.&nbsp;
        Nearly half the country’s population has to collect
        water.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some walking for up to six hours each day in
        doing so, but things are changing.” </p>
      <p>“This is a Hippo water roller, astounding in its
        simplicity.&nbsp; Where people once had to carry small amounts
        of water over a long period of time, they are now able to
        collect and transport a day’s supply with ease.” </p>
      <p>Louis Groenewald - Hippo Water Roller Project: --- “The
        intention is literally to touch hundreds of thousands of
        people’s lives from the very moment they get a Hippo
        roller.&nbsp; It’s a case of first world technology in a genuine
        third world environment.” world technology in a genuine third
        world environment.” </p>
      <p>It’s changed this shopkeeper’s life in the most fundamental of
        ways. “I used to have to fetch water six or seven times a day,”
        says Victoria, “Now with the Hippo I do it once in every two or
        three days.” </p>
      <p>“Ironically, the same engineers who created weapons of war in
        the Apartheid years have reinvented the Wheel.” </p>
      <p>Clara Masinga - Community Leader: --- “After the Hippo Rollers,
        our lives changed.” </p>
      <p>“For the first time community leader Clara has been able to
        grow a viable vegetable garden.&nbsp; She and her neighbours
        have more time to cultivate the crop as well as a means of
        irrigating it.&nbsp;&nbsp; And for those who have literally
        spent most of their lives carrying water, there is hope of
        better times.” </p>
      <p>“With the financial assistance of others, there’s now the real
        possibility that a burden carried for so long can be set aside
        forever.” </p>

        <p><b><font size="+1">Distribution</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt 18pt; text-indent:
        -18pt;">People in many countries around the world are faced with
        similar circumstances with regard to inadequate access to
        water.&nbsp; The vast majority of communities in these regions
        are impoverished, requiring donor support. </p>
      <p>All Hippo Water Rollers are currently manufactured in South
        Africa and the opportunity exists for local distributors to be
        appointed in other countries on two levels: </p>
      <p>Level 1:&nbsp; Distribute Hippo Water Rollers in the county of
        representation by importing from South Africa </p>
      <p>Level 2:&nbsp; Manufacture and distribute Hippo Water Rollers
        in the chosen country of representation </p>
      <p>Exporting the manufactured Hippo Water Roller from South Africa
        is costly due to the large empty drums filled with air!&nbsp; A
        20-Foot container takes 175 x rollers, and a 40-foot container
        takes 350 x rollers. We are also able to provide a complete
        manufacturing plant and training for anyone wishing to produce
        'Hippo Water Rollers' under license in another country. Once a
        license agreement has been established and a plant has been
        purchased and installed, raw materials are then imported to the
        plant where manufacturing and distribution occurs. </p>

        <p><b>How Carrying Water Affects Women's Health</b></p>
      </center>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;">One of the aims
        of the Water Decade was to reduce the social, economic and
        health consequences of carrying water by providing a safe water
        supply within reasonable walking distance. Many projects have
        been developed, but few are concerned specifically with the
        health effects of carrying heavy loads of water over long
        distances. </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;">Women in many
        countries prefer buckets, tins or Jerry cans to traditional
        containers such as calabashes and clay pots. The weight of an
        empty container varies between 500g and 5 kg (1 and 10 pounds),
        depending on the material; plastic is the lightest. The average
        quantity of water held in a container ranges between about 12
        and 25 liters (3 and 5 gallons). The most common method of
        carrying water is on the head, particularly in&nbsp; Africa. </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;">Women sometimes
        carry several containers, increasing the weight of the load to
        50-kg (110 pounds). Carrying water on the head requires strength
        in the neck and considerable skill, a skill often-acquired
        around nine years old. </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;"><b>General
          health effects</b> </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;">The task of
        carrying heavy loads over long distances requires a great deal
        of energy, which comes from metabolized food. The longer the
        distance and the more difficult the terrain, the greater the
        quantity of food needed. Women carrying water are frequently
        exposed to malnutrition, anemia and water-related diseases. </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;">Women are most
        vulnerable to malnutrition at the end of the dry season when
        they have to travel even greater distances to fetch water. Women
        and children suffering from malnutrition are also more
        susceptible to other diseases. </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;">Some 230 million
        people are estimated to be anemic, and pregnant women, in
        particular, are at risk. In Africa, 40 per cent of non-pregnant
        and 63 per cent of pregnant women are anemic. During pregnancy,
        the arduous task of carrying water can cause problems with the
        growth of a fetus. Women have to resume fetching water soon
        after giving birth, which can affect the quantity and quality of
        breast milk, making the baby vulnerable to malnutrition. Women
        collecting water from certain environments may be exposed to
        water-related diseases such as malaria, fiariasis and
        schistosomiasis. </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;"><b>Effects on
          the skeleton</b> </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;">Carrying heavy
        loads over long periods of time can result in damage to the
        vertebral column. In normal physiological conditions, the
        vertebral column is resistant and can support great strains, but
        this changes as people age. A major problem arising from
        carrying water is the early aging of the vertebral column. This
        may be influenced by several factors, the most important of
        which is overwork. A hereditary factor may also exist in certain
        families, causing rheumatism. </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;">Problems occur
        in the organic tissue: the disc decreases and becomes thinner.
        The nucleus becomes fibrous and no longer acts as a shock
        absorber. The vertebral bodies become more fragile and tend to
        change shape from rectangular to cuneiform. This may lead to a
        deformity called cyphosis. </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;">At the same
        time, clinical symptoms appear in the form of pain, which
        increases with work, at the end of the day and in cold
        temperatures. Mobility often becomes limited: on waking up,
        considerable stretching is required before normal mobility can
        be achieved. As people move less because of pain, so their
        movements become more and more restricted until they may reach a
        stage where they cannot move at all. Because of modifications in
        physiological conditions, the vertebral column can no longer
        fulfill its functions. </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;">Where children
        are concerned, the main problem associated with carrying heavy
        loads of water is the effect on the growth of bones. When
        children begin to carry water, they are still growing and a
        deformity known as scoliosos of the vertebral column may occur.
        Also, because of the development of the neck muscles, they may
        have problems with the thyroid gland. Other problems include
        fractures, slipped discs and damage to the knees. </p>

      <p><b>Sustainable Food Security</b> </p>
      <p>The Hippo Food Security system is designed to meet the
        nutritional needs of an average-sized family.&nbsp; It is also
        suitable for many self-help projects, feeding schemes and other
        poverty reduction projects.&nbsp; All that is required is a
        small piece of ground.&nbsp; The drip irrigation system can be
        configured and sized to suit any available area of land (up to
        50m2). </p>
      <p><b>Water Supply?</b> </p>
      <p>Healthy crops require a regular and sustainable water supply
        for good quality growth.&nbsp; In many communities, water
        sources are scarce and located far away.&nbsp; The Hippo Water
        Roller is used to bring water to the irrigation system from any
        available source with ease, 90 litres at a time.&nbsp; In
        addition the roller can be used to meet normal household needs
        too.&nbsp; Water used for washing (grey water) can be
        transferred to the reservoir for irrigating plants. </p>
      <p><b>Why Drip Irrigation?</b> </p>
      <p>Water is provided slowly to the roots of plants through drip
        emitters ensuring a high moisture level in the soil in which
        crops can thrive.&nbsp; Drip irrigation can be adapted to any
        farmable slope, suits most types of soil and is most beneficial
        when water is scarce.&nbsp; This method of watering plants is
        also very economical and simple to control. </p>
      <p><b>Responsible Use of Available Water</b> </p>
      <p>Vegetable crops require the right amount of water for good
        growth, not necessarily large amounts of water.&nbsp; Gravity
        fed (low pressure) drip irrigation is able to deliver water
        directly to the roots through small openings (emitters) in the
        drip lines at a very slow rate without losing large amounts to
        evaporation or to run-off on steep slopes. </p>
      <p><b>Improved Health</b> </p>
      <p>Eating a balanced diet from growing a variety of vegetables and
        fruit trees empowers communities to get access to good nutrients
        for improved health, which has the added benefit of retarding
        the effects of HIV/AIDS. </p>
      <p><b>Income Generation</b> </p>
      <p>The first harvest takes approximately 3 months to mature.&nbsp;
        Thereafter, there will be no need to purchase vegetables, which
        will help to reduce household expenses.&nbsp; Once a family has
        become self sufficient, they will have the means to grow and
        sell surplus crops, seedlings and flowers for additional income.
      </p>
      <p><b>The Hippo Food Security System</b> </p>
      <p>The complete pre-assembled package includes the following:
        (other variations are available) <br>
        - A 210-litre plastic reservoir (drum): for supplying water to
        the irrigation system.&nbsp; (this reservoir is optional) <br>
        - A 90-litre Hippo Water Roller: for bringing water to the
        irrigation system and for household use.&nbsp; (The Hippo Water
        Roller can also be connected directly to the feeder hose
        eliminating the need and cost of the larger 210-litre
        reservoir.&nbsp; A second screw cap with pipe adapter is
        required.) <br>
        - Eight x 6-metre length drip lines: will cover an area of 50m2
        (These can be expanded or reduced in quantity to suit individual
        requirements.) <br>
        - Tools and instructions: for creating drip emitters according
        to the required spacing for the different vegetable seeds to be
        planted. <br>
        - A starter pack: consisting of a variety of seeds for both
        winter and summer sufficient for a family of six. </p>
      <p><b>Unique Drip Emitters</b> <br>
        The simple drip emitters were designed using low-cost
        appropriate technology to suit third-world conditions.&nbsp;
        They are easily manufactured, maintained and unblocked. <br>
        The spacing of the emitters will be determined by the choice of
        seed to be planted in each row.&nbsp; For example: Onions @
        15cm, Spinach @ 30cm, Cabbage @ 45cm, Pumpkins @ 1,5m, etc. </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0px;"><b>Pre-Assembly and Packaging</b> <br>
        The complete system is pre-assembled before packaging. <br>
        The Hippo Water Roller and handle are placed inside the large
        reservoir. <br>
        The individual drip lines are then rolled up and placed inside
        the reservoir on top of the roller. <br>
        The tools, instructions and starter pack are also placed within
        the reservoir, which is then sealed, ready for shipping. <br>
        Once delivered, the system is quickly unpacked, laid-out and
        emitters inserted. <br>
        After the reservoir (or Hippo Water Roller) has been elevated
        and filled with water, the Hippo Drip Irrigation system is
        ready. </p>

      </center>
      <p>Many countries throughout Africa and other parts of the world
        are devastated by the impact of land mines. The cost in terms of
        human suffering and resultant dependency on the state by the
        maimed is crippling and extremely de-motivating. </p>
      <p>Tests were conducted near Pretoria, South Africa using Hippo
        Water Rollers to establish what the impact might be on a person
        should the roller trigger an anti-personnel land mine. </p>
      <p>A hippo Water Roller filled with 90 liters (20 gallons) of
        water was pulled over a land mine that had been planted in front
        of a soft cardboard model mounted on a steel frame. </p>
      <p>The shock wave and incredible heat (3,000<sup>o</sup>C)
        generated by the blast were absorbed so effectively by the water
        that not even a yellow flame was noticeable. Very little damage
        was evident on the cardboard model. </p>
      <p>In all three tests, indications were that no hospitalization
        would be required. Some bruising and lacerations may occur
        caused by bits of plastic from the roller. </p>
      <p>Though not recommended as a de-mining device, the Hippo Water
        Roller will save both life and limb and at the same time
        alleviate the need for improved access to water. </p>
