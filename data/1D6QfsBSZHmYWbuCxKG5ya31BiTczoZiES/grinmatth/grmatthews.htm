    </div>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">They called him ‘Death Ray Matthews’.
      It wasn’t a name he chose for himself, but of all the inventions
      Harry Grindell Matthews was known for, it was the death ray for
      which he was both feted and vilified. Was he a charismatic mixture
      of visionary and charlatan, or an ignored and embittered inventor
      who could have shortened both World Wars? Whatever the answer, his
      story is a fascinating one, not least because it brings into sharp
      focus how the British Government viewed fortean ideas in the early
      years of the 20th century. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">By any standards Harry Grindell
      Matthews led a remarkable life. Born in 1880 at Winterbourne in
      Gloucestershire, he was educated at the Merchant Venturer’s School
      in Bristol before training as an electrical engineer. During the
      Boer War he enlisted in the Baden-Powell South African
      Constabulary and was wounded twice. On his return to Britain he
      pursued his interest in the burgeoning electrical sciences on the
      estate of Lord de la Warr at Bexhill-on-Sea. There he displayed a
      natural aptitude for ‘thinking outside the box’ and began to first
      visualise and later produce a remarkable series of inventions. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">For years Matthews had been fascinated
      by the idea of communication over distances without the use of
      wires and, following in Marconi’s footsteps, in 1911 he staged a
      demonstration of radio telephony, transmitting a message from the
      ground to B C Hucks flying two miles (3.2km) away and at 600 ft
      (183m). Hucks himself deserves a footnote in the annals of
      forteana as being the maverick flier who was sent to search the
      Scottish lowlands for alleged German bases during the phantom
      Zeppelin scares of the First World War. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">His wireless telephone experiments
      attracted a great deal of attention in high places and the Court
      Circular of 5 July 1912 edition of The Times boldly stated,
      “Buckingham Palace, July 4th. Her Majesty this afternoon inspected
      the wireless telephone invented by Mr. Grindell Matthews.”
      Contemporary photographs depict him chatting with the likes of
      future Prime Minister Lloyd George. These early forays into the
      world of invention were soon noticed by the War Office and the
      Admiralty, forerunners of today’s Ministry of Defence. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Fame and fortune awaited those who
      could successfully develop inventions that could be useful to the
      armed forces and Matthews saw a gap in the market through which he
      could become wealthy and serve his country. How he went about that
      process, however, casts doubt on his real motives and the
      authenticity of all his inventions, most notably the death ray. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">But to understand both Matthews’
      relationship with officialdom and the ultimate failure of the
      death ray we need first to trace his steps between 1911 and 1924.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">In the run-up to the First World War,
      the Admiralty took an interest in his Aerophone device and
      Matthews was invited to give a demonstration. As his patents at
      that time were only provisional he demanded that no ‘experts’ be
      present. The Admiralty agreed and the demonstration went ahead.
      But before it was completed Matthews’ assistant discovered four of
      the invited observers had taken advantage of his absence from the
      room to dismantle the apparatus, taking notes and sketches. In a
      rage, Matthews cancelled the demonstration immediately and sent
      everyone away, despite the protests of the Admiralty officials. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The press scented a scandal and was
      immediately on Matthews’ side, national and provincial papers
      trumpeting his cause, outraged at the intransigence of the
      Admiralty. Public opinion was whipped into such frenzy that the
      War Office had no option but to face up publicly both to the press
      and the upstart who challenged them. A statement was issued via
      The Daily Telegraph in which the War Office denied any tampering
      and insisted that the Aerophone experiment had been a failure. As
      the experiment had not even begun before the men from the ministry
      began their tampering, Matthews sensed jealousy, if not a cover
      up, was at work. Faced with an official denial, he had a change of
      mind and in turn issued a statement retracting his claims and
      downsizing the affair to a ‘misunderstanding’. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">This bizarre incident was one of many
      where Matthews would announce an invention only to fail at the
      last minute, for whatever reason, to demonstrate it working
      successfully. It was also the genesis of the media’s love affair
      with Matthews and his inventions. More importantly it marked the
      drawing of a line in the sand between Matthews’ essentially
      fortean ideas and the staid mechanistic traditions of the British
      scientific establishment. Matthews then faded from the public gaze
      until World War One. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Now, in 1914 and faced with the
      prospect of a lengthy conflict, the British government was
      desperate for innovations which would help them wage war against
      Germany. Two inventions interested them greatly. The first was a
      ray which would disable the Zeppelins, and the second was a ray
      which could control unmanned craft. A reward of £25,000 was
      offered to the person who came up with either. Matthews was
      convinced he could provide the latter and claimed he had developed
      a remote control system using cells containing selenium. After
      testing his invention on Edgbaston Reservoir, he demonstrated it
      to Admiralty officials at Richmond Park’s Penn Pond. They were so
      impressed that Matthews received his cheque for £25,000 the
      following morning, a not inconsiderable sum of money in 1915. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Yet there was something not quite
      right about this event. Although the remote control boat had been
      proven to the Admiralty officials and a vast sum of money paid,
      the idea never manifested as workable in practice. The Admiralty,
      for whatever reason, chose not to pursue Matthews’ selenium
      control system which, besides operating boats remotely, was
      claimed to detonate explosives at a distance. Was this ignorance
      and jealousy on behalf of the War Office or the first hints that
      Matthews wasn’t quite as genuine as he appeared? Again Matthews
      lapsed into obscurity. He re-appeared briefly, yet significantly,
      in 1921, breaking new ground by producing the world’s first
      talking picture. This was a short interview with the explorer
      Ernest Shackleton prior to his fatal attempt at circumnavigating
      the Antarctic. This film is important because it proves Matthews,
      despite the hype and ambiguity which often attended his
      inventions, was not a charlatan, and was in many ways years ahead
      of his time. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Unfortunately, the British film
      industry told Matthews that ‘talkies’ would never catch on. Just a
      few years later, the Americans embraced the talking film and
      revolutionised the movie industry for ever. Why was Grindell
      Matthews’ invention not taken up? Why indeed? </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The static carnage of World War One
      had set inventors thinking about how the impasse of trench warfare
      could be broken. All the talk was of some kind of ‘ray’ which
      could disable men and machines at great distances. Both H G Wells
      and H Rider Haggard had produced fictional accounts of such a
      ‘death ray’ years earlier and as forteans know, whatever can be
      imagined can be invented. Or can it? </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Matthews turned his mind to the idea
      of a possible death ray in the autumn of 1923. After reading news
      reports of French airplanes dropping out of the sky over Germany,
      he said: “I realized that the Germans had found an invisible ray
      that put the magnetos of the aircraft out of action. I
      concentrated on efforts to discover what it was, and with the
      electric ray now at my command I think I have succeeded.” Select
      journalists were given a demonstration of Matthews’ ‘ray’ stopping
      a motor cycle engine at a distance of 50 ft (15m). “I am
      confident,” Matthews announced, “that if I have facilities for
      developing it I can stop aeroplanes in flight –- indeed I believe
      the ray is sufficiently powerful to destroy the air, to explode
      powder magazines, and destroy anything on which it rests.” </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Thus the death ray was born in the
      mind of the popular press. Matthews capitalised on his new-found
      fame, being well aware that his stock was not particularly high
      with the British government. So, rather than approach them
      directly, he went to his old friends the press. They were only too
      happy to help, and fanciful accounts of the death ray and what it
      could do began to appear by late 1923. Bemused by Matthew’s sudden
      re-appearance but fearful that the publicity he was enjoying would
      lead to another nation bidding for the death ray, the War Office
      was forced to act. Swallowing their pride and suspending their
      disbelief, in February 1924 the Air Ministry offered Matthews the
      opportunity to demonstrate his death ray to them. Matthews at
      first ignored their advances, perhaps hoping the government would
      simply accept his assertion that the ray did as he said. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">When no such offer was forthcoming,
      Matthews contacted the press with further dramatic claims and by
      April 1924 the death ray – or more properly the idea of the death
      ray – was world news. The London Star announced the invention as a
      “wonderful invisible ray which has turned into fact the dreams of
      Wells’ fiction.” And they hadn't even seen it yet! A wide-eyed
      Star reporter was ushered into Matthews’ London laboratory and
      shown a bowl of gunpowder being ignited by the ray. Matthews was
      at pains to explain this was only the beginning, a small scale
      demonstration of what could easily be the destruction of
      ammunition dumps at huge distances or the destruction of aeroplane
      engines in flight. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The scientific principles on which the
      ‘ray’ worked were glossed over by all concerned. Ionized air
      carrying an electrical current was mentioned by some commentators,
      others talked of exceptionally short radio waves. Matthews wasn’t
      saying and no-one appeared to be asking the right questions,
      certainly not the press. To them the idea of a death ray was
      enough. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Still the government wouldn’t commit
      itself and now Matthews was receiving offers from other countries,
      notably big business concerns in France. By mid-May 1924 the press
      was reporting, “...while the British government is interested it
      is not willing to assist him in perfecting his experiments and he
      is unable to resist the princely offer made by the Lyons firm.” </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Despite their initial interest, strong
      doubts were beginning to be expressed by the Air Ministry. They
      had been duped or conned many times before by ‘inventors’ who made
      great claims but failed to deliver the promised inventions. They
      may even have been duped by Matthews himself. An internal
      government memo coyly suggested that Matthews’ 1915 payment of
      £25,000 was largely due to the influence of one particular lord
      and was not entirely deserved. Worryingly, it also suggested that
      enquiries should be “instituted with the Birmingham Police records
      as to Mr G Matthews’ past history.” </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">A secret report looking into Matthews’
      claims and past history was apparently generated by the
      Intelligence Services, but appears not to survive in the Public
      Record Office at Kew. The old rivalries were at work again. But
      Matthews had some support in the British government, notably from
      Admiral Kerr who persuaded him not to sell his invention to
      another power. Kerr claimed Matthews “had given his word of honour
      not to divulge the secret of the ray until I confer with members
      of the British cabinet.” </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Matthews, now in negotiations to sell
      his invention in France, was persuaded to return to England to
      demonstrate his ‘death ray’ to the three armed forces on 26 April
      at noon, one o’clock and 1.30pm. But the much vaunted ‘death ray’
      demonstration was something of an anti-climax. After being ushered
      into Matthews’ laboratory various leading government officials
      were shown just two examples of the ray’s efficacy. An Osglim
      light bulb was held in the path of the ‘ray’. When the ray was
      switched on the bulb lit. A small motor mounted on a bench was
      then started and immediately brought to a halt by the ‘ray’. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">From these experiments – both easily
      carried out using scientific techniques available at the time –
      Matthews expected the full confidence of the British government.
      He would be disappointed. Immediately following the demonstration,
      a meeting was convened by the Air Ministry at 4.00pm to discuss
      the death ray. Those present at the demonstration were now joined
      by representatives from each of the armed forces. Each commented
      on what they had seen in Matthews’ laboratory. The reports were
      not positive. Major Wimperis from the Air Ministry stated: “I was
      rather surprised to find the inventor should imagine that one
      would be impressed.” The Admiralty’s F Smith, also doubted what he
      had seen, adding that Matthews’ assistants even appeared ignorant
      of how the ‘ray’ operated. Smith was also concerned that when he
      suggested Matthews move the cycle motor from the lab bench to the
      floor, Matthews “did not like this suggestion and explained
      further that he was in a great hurry.” </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Odd behaviour from a man who wished to
      convince the British Government of one of the greatest inventions
      yet seen. Smith sensed trickery was afoot, adding that he had been
      visited by the mysterious ‘Appleton’ – possibly an MI5 agent – who
      claimed that Matthews had no scientific knowledge as such but
      liked to experiment with “all sorts of gadgets”. This source
      suggested that Matthews “brought things up to a certain stage and
      no further, he would then raise money on what he had achieved”. In
      short, a scientific confidence trickster. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Furthermore, Appleton claimed Matthews
      was “working the press, but had now lost control of it.” The
      explicit conclusion of this meeting was that the government did
      not trust Matthews. Yet they were loathe to dismiss him completely
      as long as even a small chance remained that he could be onto
      something. No government wanted to turn down the death ray only
      for it to turn up later in the arsenal of an enemy. Air Vice
      Marshal Salmond wrote immediately to Matthews suggesting further,
      more detailed demonstrations. Matthews replied that he could not
      understand why the government would not accept the evidence he had
      presented to them. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">He had now lost patience with England
      and was offering the ‘ray’ to the French. Following this breakdown
      of communications, events took a turn that was both dramatic and
      ludicrous. Tuesday 27 May 1924 saw scenes which could have come
      straight from an Ealing Comedy. The Daily Express summed up the
      farce perfectly a day later with its front page headline
      “Melodramatic Death Ray Episodes”. Their lead article opined:
      “Melodrama has seldom surpassed the heights which were reached in
      yesterday’s ‘Death Ray’ episodes. Hurried legal action in the High
      Court was followed by an unsuccessful motor-car chase, an air
      journey by Mr. Grindell Matthews to Paris, a belated renewal of
      conversations on this side of the channel, a reopening of
      negotiations in France and a deluge of claims by rival inventors.
      Beneath all was the undertone of tragedy suggested by the terrible
      powers which are attributed to the ray.” </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">At 10.40 that morning, the High Court
      in London granted an injunction to Matthews’ financial backers,
      restraining him from selling the rights to the death ray. At 10.45
      am a blissfully unaware Matthews set off for Croydon aerodrome and
      the lunchtime flight to Paris. Three minutes later, Major H
      Wimperis arrived at Grindell Matthews’ laboratory, in an attempt
      to further broker a deal. As they were leaving, Matthews’
      financial backers and their solicitor arrived bearing the recently
      issued injunction. Finding Matthews gone, they hired the fastest
      car available and sped to Croydon to prevent him leaving for
      France. They roared on to the runway seconds too late and could
      only watch in dismay as the small mail plane headed towards the
      Channel. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Questioned later, E Gubbins, one of
      Matthews’ investors, remained utterly persuaded of the ray’s
      potency, saying, “I am convinced that the ray is the most terrible
      invention which has been created in recent years. It is of such a
      nature that it will make wars impossible if held by Britain. Other
      countries could not hope to combat a power armed with such a
      weapon.” Matthews, meanwhile, was again negotiating terms with the
      French and was met at Le Bourget airfield by Eugene Royer prior to
      a meeting that evening with the director of the Chantier du Rhône,
      an important Lyons steel firm. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Meanwhile the deluge of publicity
      which attended Grindell Matthews’ stand-off with the British
      government brought a flood of other death ray inventors out of the
      woodwork. At least 10 people, it seemed, had been harbouring death
      rays in their private laboratories and sheds, and the War Office
      was inundated with claimants. Several of these inventors were also
      investigated by the War Office but, as with Matthews, none could
      back their claims with meaningful demonstrations. The press were
      incensed when they discovered Matthews was dealing with the
      French, and wouldn’t let the matter drop. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Once again, the government was forced
      by popular opinion to make official statements and on 28 May
      questions were asked in the House of Commons. Mr Leach, Under
      Secretary for Air, was questioned by Commander Kenworthy, who
      demanded to know what steps were being taken to prevent an
      invention of the death ray’s magnitude from leaving the country.
      Leach re-iterated the government's position, “We are not in a
      position to pass judgment on the value of this ray, because we
      have not been allowed to make proper tests. Therefore whether
      there is anything in it or not still remains unexplored. The
      Departments have been placed in a difficult position in dealing
      with the matter partly because of the vigorous Press campaign
      conducted on behalf of this gentleman, and partly because this is
      not the first occasion on which the inventor has put forward a
      scheme for which extravagant claims have been made. The result is
      the Departments are not able to accept Mr Grindell Matthews’
      statement about this invention without a scrutiny which he is not
      prepared to face.” </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Unpicking this carefully-worded
      statement laid bare the government’s inherent scepticism regarding
      Matthews’ claims. Yes, government officials had seen a
      demonstration of the alleged death ray – but they were keen to
      point out that the circumstances of demonstration were of
      Matthews’ choosing, at his laboratory with all equipment being
      provided and set up by him. In government speak: “The departmental
      representatives were shown nothing which would lead them to credit
      the statements which have appeared in the Press as to the
      possibilities of the invention.” </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Furthermore, His Majesty’s Government
      believed that “the conditions under which the demonstrations were
      made by Mr Matthews were such that it was not possible to form any
      opinion as to the value of the device.” Carefully worded or not,
      the implication seemed to be that Grindell Matthews at best may
      have not demonstrated his invention under correct laboratory
      conditions, and at worst had brazenly attempted to defraud the
      British Government. The statement went on to stress that the
      government had been at pains to be scrupulously fair with
      Matthews, offering him the chance to repeat the demonstration. All
      they required to be convinced was that he use his ray to stop the
      engine of a petrol driven motorcycle engine provided by them. On
      successful completion of this test, Matthews would then be given
      £1,000 as a retainer for 14 days whilst the government considered
      “the basis of further financial negotiations for the purchase or
      development of his invention.” As yet, the government didn’t even
      want to know how the ray worked, just for it to be demonstrated to
      their satisfaction using their own laboratory conditions. Not an
      unreasonable request. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The statement ended somewhat tersely:
      “Mr Grindell Matthews has refused this offer and it is clear he
      has left the country.” Unfazed by this scepticism, Grindell
      Matthews, still in France, announced he now had eight bids under
      consideration. Charles Dick of the British Consulate in Paris met
      with Matthews. Dick had investigated Matthews’ French backer,
      Eugene Royer, and found him to be untrustworthy and on the point
      of bankruptcy. Matthews seemed unconcerned by this news, happy to
      work for Royer seemingly to spite the British government for
      daring to ask for that most vulgar of displays, ‘proof’. Dick’s
      subsequent letter to the Air Ministry contained a stark character
      sketch of Matthews, observing: “It would certainly be advisable to
      recommend the very greatest caution in dealing with Mr Matthews if
      he is in any way connected with Royer. If such a connection comes
      about after the warning I gave Mr. Matthews, I should feel obliged
      to consider that the latter was as unworthy of confidence as the
      former.” </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The British government wasn’t the only
      party in the country interested in the death ray. Sir Samuel
      Instone and his brother offered Matthews a substantial cash
      payment plus a salary of several thousand pounds a year if he
      would keep the invention in the UK. “Our offer still stands. It is
      made on purely patriotic grounds. Mr Grindell Matthews can have
      all the money he needs,” said Theodore Instone. Yet Matthews
      refused this offer too. Perhaps it had something to do with the
      concluding part of Instone’s statement which read, “…providing he
      satisfies our scientific advisors that the ray has serious
      possibilities.” There it was again. The small, but significantly
      unavoidable matter of conclusive proof that the alleged death ray
      worked as its inventor claimed. Even the loftiest fortean ideas
      begin to crumble when they are revealed to be empty promises. And
      by now, to all but the most gullible observer, the ‘death ray’ was
      looking very much like an empty promise. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">An Air Ministry official summed up the
      problem succinctly, saying: “This invention is either worth a
      large sum of money or it is worth nothing. No inventor could
      reasonably expect the government to pay a large sum of money for a
      patent until it had been fully tested. If the invention fulfils
      all that is claimed for it, the inventor has nothing to fear from
      official sources.” </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Quite so. But neither Matthews nor any
      of his imitators could provide the vital proof needed. The death
      ray, upon which thousands of pounds, hundreds of hours and
      millions of column inches had been spent, was worth nothing to
      anyone as an idea alone. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The 1st of June 1924 saw Matthews
      returning to London, and he was angry. In an interview with the
      Sunday Express he defended his life’s work even to the point of
      raging at those who referred to his notorious invention as a
      ‘ray’. It was, he claimed, a ‘beam’, not a ray, although quite
      what the difference was he failed to say. Matthews still believed
      he had a deal with Royer and was insistent his death ray was all
      packed and ready to be shipped to France for further development.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Once again the press took up Matthews’
      cause and allowed him space to rail against those who doubted him.
      In response to Lord Birkenhead who had written to The Times
      criticising his ‘ray’, Matthews argued that it was this attitude
      which had lost Britain the advantage in many other areas of
      warfare such as æronautics and torpedo development. Despite all
      the talk of ideas and possibilities, as yet few people outside
      Grindell Matthews’ intimate circle had actually seen his death ray
      apparatus. This was rectified in the summer of 1924 with the
      release of the film The Death Ray. Made by Pathé, the 25-minute
      film was basically a drama-documentary, an advertisement for Harry
      Grindell Matthews and all his works. <br>
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">From an entertainment perspective the
      film made great viewing, coming as it did in the wake of the
      massive publicity given the death ray furor. Yet there was no
      evidence that the subject matter of the film had any basis in
      reality. Stills show fantastic apparatus, claimed to be the death
      ray, but which bear no relation to the small Heath Robinson-like
      machine demonstrated to the government weeks earlier. Poetic
      license was clearly at work and S R Littlewood, in The Sphere,
      made some perceptive observations relevant to the whole affair:
      “...The Death Ray in which Mr Grindell Matthews is shown pulling
      levers of his machine and a rat is shown falling dead in its cage,
      a bicycle stopping and aeroplanes galore falling down in flames
      from the sky. From the scientific point of view – that is to say
      as a proof that it was the ray that killed the rat – I do not
      suppose that The Death Ray is intended to be regarded as of any
      value at all. One does not for a moment disbelieve Mr Grindell
      Matthews. At the same time a film which could have been so
      obviously ‘faked’ leaves one simply with the same amount of
      information as one had before save, perhaps, as to the shape of
      the machine, which is a sort of searchlight with three
      megaphone-like ears attached to it. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">“There remains, however, the
      remarkable personality of Mr Grindell Matthews himself. One cannot
      help being at least bewildered by the psychology of a scientist
      who can enter into the spirit of a piece of mummery like this so
      completely that it is quite clear he was acting for all he was
      worth. In view of his many experiments it can evidently have been
      no great emotional strain to Mr Grindell Matthews to pull a lever
      with the intention of doing nothing worse than stopping a
      bicycle-wheel. Yet he pulls that lever with as much impressive
      gravity as if he were about some operation upon which life and
      death depended.” </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">This seemingly trivial excursion into
      film may have been a shrewd move by Matthews. The blanket press
      coverage of the death ray story had captured the public
      imagination. Now the death ray film allowed them to ‘see’ it with
      their own eyes, and was a perfect visual advertisement for
      Matthews, one which was shown widely across Britain and America.
      It comes as no surprise then that following Matthews’ inability to
      conclusively demonstrate the death ray he abandoned the quest to
      sell his invention to European governments and in July departed to
      America. Once again he set about publicising the death ray,
      announcing he would develop a higher-powered version of the
      machine that would convince the world his “beam deserves a place
      among the great inventions of history”. There were immediate
      problems when he was offered $25,000 to demonstrate the ray to the
      Radio World Fair at Madison Square Garden in December. Matthews
      again declined the offer of easy money, this time claiming that he
      was not permitted to demonstrate his invention outside England.
      This is a curious statement as there is no evidence he was under
      any such constraint, legal or political. Once again, Matthews the
      showman was taking his game to the brink. He tantalised the
      American public, telling how he would return to Britain and set up
      a research station on an island in the Bristol Channel to continue
      his work so that, “in eighteen months I can perfect my apparatus
      so that it will be the most formidable war weapon of the future”.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Somewhat predictably, his assertions
      drew criticism from the American scientific establishment.
      Professor R Woods was scornful of the death ray and offered to
      stand in front of it for an indefinite period, confident it would
      do him no harm. “Nothing”, he said, “has been done that could lead
      a scientist or engineer to place the slightest credence in the
      death ray.” Criticism not-withstanding, on his return to Britain
      Matthews later claimed that ‘America’ (he was vague) had snapped
      up his death ray invention. Quite where this left his claim that
      he was not permitted to demonstrate the ray outside England was
      unclear. Nor was it stated to whom he had sold his ray. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The Observer seized on these
      contradictions, noting how: “Many people in this country will be
      curious to know the terms and conditions on which the United
      States have obtained a monopoly of Mr Grindell Matthews’ ‘Ray’”.
      Matthews himself was tight-lipped, refusing to say who or how
      much. All he would say was that he had returned merely to collect
      everything he owned before returning to America. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">There the saga of the death ray ends.
      Matthews never managed to successfully demonstrate his invention
      to anyone's satisfaction. Whether this was because it was a
      complex money-making scam or whether the world’s governments were
      incapable of grasping the enormity of his ideas is unclear. We do
      know however that no-one ever developed a death ray, nor did
      Matthews pursue the invention further. Instead he went back to
      America where he worked as a consultant for Warner Brothers,
      putting his genuine skills in sound and vision technology to good
      use. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">By the late 1920s, Matthews was back
      in Britain with a series of new, bold inventions which actually
      worked. His piece de resistance was a device to project
      advertisements on clouds. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">On Christmas Eve 1930 he stunned
      London by projecting the image of an angel onto clouds above
      Hampstead Heath. The apparition was so realistic that people miles
      away apparently fell to their knees in worship, believing the
      Second Coming was at hand! He followed this with demonstrations in
      New York, where he projected the Stars and Stripes 10,000ft
      (3,000m) above the city (see below). </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">This invention clearly worked, yet
      once again Matthews was beset by problems. Although the invention
      could have revolutionised the emerging advertising industry,
      no-one seemed interested. Matthews had little time to reflect on
      this new failure as darker clouds were gathering and in 1931 he
      faced bankruptcy. His bankruptcy papers make interesting reading.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Question: “What is your full name?” <br>
      Answer: “Harry Grindell Grindell.” </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Grindell Matthews, it seems, wasn't
      even his real name. The bankruptcy enquiry laid bare his financial
      and personal affairs, reducing his claims and inventions to mere
      transactions in a ledger book, profit and loss. The papers reveal
      a series of loans and investments made to Matthews, none of which
      made money, but which allowed him to live in hotels and luxury
      rented accomm-odation whilst he developed his various inventions.
      Undeterred, Matthews’ bounced back from bankruptcy and by 1934 he
      had raised sufficient funds from a new generation of financial
      backers to relocate to South Wales. There he became a
      semi-recluse, building a fortified laboratory with its own private
      airfield on the summit of Tor Cloud near Swansea. He soon became
      the subject of local lore and legend, with the police arriving in
      response to claims that his ‘rays’ were causing illness among the
      local population. Other stories spread that car engines would stop
      if they drove too near Matthews’ mountain fastness. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Financially secure again, he embarked
      on another series of inventions. Seeing that the Second World War
      was on the horizon, he began to develop the idea of ærial mines
      fired by rockets or suspended by barrage balloons. These, he
      claimed, could create an effective ærial ring of defence round
      cities such as London. This idea was discussed seriously by the
      government but never taken up as a practical proposal. Matthews’
      mind, never still, then came up with the idea of the ‘stratoplane’
      – a “plane which could fly on the edges of space.” He became a
      member of the British Interplanetary Society and actively pushed
      forward ideas which led eventually to the development of rocket
      technology. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">There were many more inventions,
      including a system for detecting submarines. Matthews hauled these
      around government departments but as war clouds gathered people
      had less and less time for Matthews’ speculations. The death ray
      had proved the death knell for his reputation. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">When war finally arrived, Matthews
      noted that had his inventions such as the ærial mines been taken
      up, London would not have suffered as much as it did in the Blitz.
      He could now also see how useful his submarine detector would have
      been against the U-Boats stalking the Atlantic. But it was to no
      avail. Time had passed him by and on 11 September 1941 Death Ray
      Matthews died of a massive heart attack. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Genius or charlatan, probably a little
      of both, Grindell Matthews inspired intense debate and massive
      publicity. Some of his inventions such as the talking films,
      ærophone and sky-projector certainly worked and were years ahead
      of their time. Other ideas such as his theories of space travel
      would come to fruition later in the 20th century. But it was for
      the death ray he was best known and it was his failure to deliver
      the goods which was his event-ual downfall, leading the scientific
      and political establishments of the era to overlook his other
      inventions. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">It would be charitable to speculate
      that his flirtation with the death ray was mere showmanship to
      attract money for his more conventional ideas, much in the same
      way that the SETI programme maintains interest in more mundane
      aspects of space exploration. If so, it was a gamble which didn't
      pay off. We will probably never know.<br>

    </div>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp; <br>
      Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin, in a prophetic speech to the House
      of Commons in 1932, declared: “it is well for the man in the
      street to realise that there is no power on earth that can protect
      him from being bombed... the bomber will always get through.” </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Throughout that decade the dreaded
      German Luftwaffe threatened to bring devastation to cities across
      Europe, including the British Isles. Consequently, the British
      Government was desperate to find an effective method of detection
      or defence and once again turned to a ‘death ray.’ </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">In 1934 the Air Ministry set up the
      Committee for the Scientific Survey of Air Defence. CSSAD
      contained some of the brightest minds of the day, and was chaired
      by the distinguished Oxford-trained chemist, Sir Henry Tizard, who
      two decades later would create the MoD’s Flying Saucer Working
      Party. Tizard’s group scrutinised a number of inventions and
      ideas, from acoustic mirrors to barrage balloons and eventually
      turned to the ‘death ray’ which many feared the Germans were
      already secretly developing. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Following the Grindell Matthews
      episode, the Air Ministry offered a standing reward of £1,000 to
      anyone who could build a death ray that could kill a sheep at 100
      yards, but no one claimed the prize. On 18 January 1935 H E
      Wimperis, the director of Scientific Research at the Air Ministry,
      approached scientist Robert Watson-Watt to advise the government
      “on the practicability of proposals of the type colloquially
      called ‘death ray.’” The Tizard committee wanted to know if it was
      possible to create a beam of electromagnetic energy which could
      fry enemy pilots in the cockpit, and detonate bombs before
      aircraft could cause damage, just as Grindell Matthews had
      proposed a decade earlier. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">As Professor R V Jones describes in
      his Most Secret War, Watson-Watt gave the problem of calculating
      the amount of power required for a death ray to his assistant,
      Arnold ‘Skip’ Watkins, who quickly concluded the proposed ray was
      way ahead of what could be achieved using current technology. When
      he handed his calculations to Watson-Watt he said: “Well then, if
      the death ray is not possible, how can we help them?” </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Wilkins replied that he was aware that
      Post Office engineers had noticed that whenever aircraft flew in
      the vicinity of BBC masts, it caused disturbances to the radio
      signal. Maybe this phenomenon could be utilised for the detecting
      enemy aircraft before they reached the British Isles? On 26
      February 1935, the day Hitler created the Luftwaffe, Watson-Watt
      and his assistant set up an experiment at Daventry in
      Northamptonshire which proved it was possible to detect aircraft
      by the use of radio waves. As an RAF bomber flew backwards and
      forwards between two BBC radio masts, the two men sat inside a van
      watching as a tiny glowing green line flared and swelled on a
      crude cathode-ray tube display. RDF, or ‘Radar’ (RAdio Detection
      And Ranging) – the greatest secret weapon in the Allied arsenal -
      was born. After the demonstration, Watson-Watt declared that
      Britain “has become an island once more.” </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The death ray may never have been a
      practical weapon, but those who had taken Grindell Matthews’
      advice to “think outside the box” and employ their imaginations
      had stumbled upon a weapon with far greater possibilities that
      would literally change the world.<br>
