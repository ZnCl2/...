        <i>'It's doing something ... completely impossible' </i><br>

      <br>
      SAN DIEGO (CNN) -- A researcher says he has done something
      "completely impossible" by harnessing the power of sound, and that
      eventually it will be available in everything from home appliances
      to industrial compressors.<br>
      <br>
      Tim Lucas says he made a radical discovery while working at the
      Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico that enables him to
      create more energy through sound waves than was ever thought
      possible.<br>
      <br>
      "It's not an incremental improvement in an existing technology,"
      Lucas says, "it's suddenly doing something which before was
      completely impossible."<br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      Scientists have long known that sound is composed of pulsing waves
      of energy, but it was considered useless as a power source because
      at high levels sound waves distort into shock waves.<br>
      <br>
      An example is the way sound distorts on a stereo or radio speakers
      when turned up too loud.<br>
      <br>
      But Lucas discovered that by sending sound waves through empty
      containers of various shapes, the shock waves were eliminated.<br>
      <br>
      Clean electric power generators?<br>
      <br>
      "Once you've done that," he says, "you can add all the energy,
      create all the pressure, and deliver all the power that you want."<br>
      <br>
      Lucas calls his invention Resonant Macrosonic Synthesis -- RMS.<br>
      <br>
      He has used it to power such things as a gas compressor, but
      believes there is so much potential that he compares what he has
      done with sound to what the laser has done with light.<br>
      <br>
      His company, Macrosonix, is working on sound wave compressors
      which might one day do everything from cool refrigerators and air
      conditioners in the home to running compressors in factories and
      on construction sites.<br>
      <br>
      The beauty of a sound-wave compressor is that it would do what a
      compressor does, but without the moving parts required in
      conventional piston technology.<br>
      <br>
      Mechanical engineering professor Mark Hamilton, who has followed
      Lucas' work, says, "I don't think the idea struck people that you
      could use sound waves to do, say, pumping that could be used on a
      commercial scale. And I think that was the innovative part of the
      idea here."<br>
      <br>
      Macrosonix researchers say they also hope to use sound to create
      clean electric power generators, replacing any number of machines
      with the technology of an empty cavity. <br>

      <br>
      Imagine a compressor in your refrigerator with no pistons,
      crankshafts, or lubricated bearings. Instead, all the work is done
      by sound waves bouncing around in an empty cavity.<br>
      <br>
      When this idea first began bouncing around Tim Lucas's head ten
      years ago, his fellow physicists told him it would never work.
      Sound waves, they pointed out, can store only a relatively small
      amount of energy before turning into jagged shock waves that
      dissipate any added energy as heat. At least that's what happens
      when a wave travels through the open air, or through a cylindrical
      "wave guide." Undaunted, Lucas experimented and found that by
      shaping the sound chamber, or resonator, into something like a
      cone or a bulb, he could keep shock waves from forming. "Most of
      the research had been done in a simple cylindrical tube, and it
      turns out that's the one resonator guaranteed to give you a shock
      wave," says Lucas. "There's an infinite family of resonators that
      can give you non-shocked waves." In his technology, which he calls
      Resonant Macrosonic Synthesis, sound waves store thousands of
      times more energy than previously thought possible.<br>
      <br>
      Lucas, who started his own company, MacroSonix Corp. in Richmond,
      Virginia, to develop RMS, has licensed it to one company (he won't
      say which) for refrigerator compressors--the part that compresses
      and circulates the coolant. The coolant passing through the cavity
      would be compressed when it encounters the high-pressure portion
      of the wave. Other applications might include cooling computer
      chips; "micronizaton," which is the pulverizing of particles down
      to microscopic size; and filtering out particles from factory
      exhaust (the sound waves would cause the particles to clump
      together). "We believe RMS is a new primary technology, something
      that functions at a fundamental level of physics," says Lucas. <br>

      Sound waves could be a source of high energy in the future thanks
      to a technique that can better control their awesome power.<br>
      <br>
      The breakthrough is known as Resonant Macrosonic Synthesis (RMS)
      and allows sound waves to be created - inside a closed resonator -
      with energy densities thousands of times greater than previously
      achieved.<br>
      <br>
      The developer, MacroSonix, already has ideas on how to create new
      industry standards. These include clean electric power generation
      for the national grid, on-site power on demand or even hybrid
      electric vehicles. For these ideas RMS could be combined with
      pulse combustion science to convert fuels such as natural gas into
      electric power.<br>
      <br>
      "RMS quite literally unlocks the power of sound," says Tim Lucas,
      founder and CEO of MacroSonix. "Now that large amounts of energy
      can be transferred into resonant sound waves, these waves can be
      used to perform industry's high-powered tasks in a completely new
      and simpler way.<br>
      <br>
      It was always believed that there was an intrinsic limit for sound
      levels in gases that would prevent such high energy levels from
      existing - usually through the formation of shock waves. This
      barrier was broken in 1990, allowing RMS to be developed - with
      details now being released eight years later.<br>
      <br>
      The key to RMS is the shape of the resonator. The resonator
      controls the shape of-the wave and can prevent the formation of
      shock waves. RMS allows the synthesis of non-shocked waveforms,
      which in turn allows large amounts of energy to be added to the
      wave, leading to extremely high dynamic pressures. Once an
      acoustic standing wave is formed the resonator’s geometry
      determines the resulting waveform, regardless of the wave’s
      amplitude.<br>
      <br>
      Now that RMS can transfer this much energy into a sound wave, a
      wide range of physical effects becomes possible.<br>
      <br>
      One example, says MacroSonix, is dynamic (oscillating) pressures
      in gases exceeding 500psi. Pressures call be generated well in
      excess of those needed commercial applications, with much higher
      pressures provided, if required.<br>
      <br>
      The fluid power industry can also benefit through RMS’s, ability
      to compress gas or to pump liquids. This will remove the need for
      moving parts, lubrication oil and cut the risk of fluid
      contamination. Industries that may benefit from this include:
      chemicals – thanks to the ability to drive and control thermal and
      kinetic chemical reactions - pharmaceuticals, semiconductor
      manufacture, natural and commercial gas handling, refrigeration,
      air conditioning and air compression.<br>
      <br>
      The technique might also be used for levitation for non-contact
      manufacturing process, by levitating and positioning heavy object
      within an RMS chamber.<br>
      <br>
      One of the first areas to take advantage of the technology is a
      lubricant-free acoustic compressor which eliminates the need for
      CFCs and promises more energy efficiency. The compressor uses
      sound to compress the gas and has no moving parts - such as
      pistons, crank shafts and bearings - so needs no oil to lubricate
      them.<br>
      <br>
      "The two waves which most apparently affect our everyday lives are
      electromagnetic waves and sound waves, ' says Lucas.
      "Electromagnetic waves have been commercialised for over 100 years
      but the commercial application of sound waves has only scratched
      the surface."<br>

        <b>by Ray Ladbury</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Researchers in acoustics have long wondered whether sound waves
      could replace mechanical components in devices such as
      compressors, combustion engines, and pumps; now a team of
      researchers in Virginia has answered - with a very loud, YES!<br>
      <br>
      Perhaps because we are constantly bombarded by sound, it is easy
      to forget that sound waves actually represent quite small pressure
      variations. The sound of a jet engine a few meters away measures
      only about 20 Pa (about 0.0002 atmospheres). As one increases the
      energy going into a sound wave, nonlinear processes in the gas in
      which the wave propagates direct more and more energy into
      harmonics of the drive frequency. The harmonics distort the sound
      wave and ultimately form shock waves. It is these shocks that
      limit the amplitudes attainable. Sound waves’ low energy levels
      and compression ratios (defined as the ratio of the waveform’s
      peak and minimum pressures) have limited their usefulness in
      high-power applications such as compressors and pumps.
      Accordingly, many researchers have wondered whether the acoustic
      saturation imposed by shock formation can be circumvented in some
      special circumstances.<br>
      <br>
      Although acoustic saturation has been found to be inevitable
      (perhaps thankfully) for sound waves propagating in free space,
      the question of whether acoustic saturation is also unavoidable
      for standing waves in resonating cavities has received little
      attention. Recently, researchers at Macrosonix Corporation
      (Richmond, Virginia) have reported creating sound waves with
      energy densities 1600 times higher than was previously possible.
      According to Macrosonix founder and CEO Tim Lucas, pressures in
      these sound waves oscillate from peak values of up to10
      atmospheres down to hard vacuum, rendering the concept of
      compression ratios all but meaningless. <br>
      <br>
      Two papers presented by Macrosonix at the December 1997 meeting of
      the Acoustical Society of America in San Diego, California,
      discuss using resonator geometry to control the phases and
      amplitudes of harmonics in a waveform, thereby tailoring the
      waveform to a particular application. The researchers christened
      this technique Resonant Macrosonic Synthesis (RMS). As an
      application of RMS, they used a specifically designed resonator
      called a horn-cone (shaped like the bell of an elongated trumpet)
      to shape the waveform to avoid the discontinuity characteristic of
      a shock. The resulting shock-free sound waves can then be driven
      at much higher amplitudes. <br>
      <br>
      Although the idea of using resonator geometry to control sound
      waveforms is not new, previous advances have been less dramatic.
      The newly synthesized sound waves are powerful enough to perform
      tasks that previously required mechanical components. Moreover,
      Lucas hopes to use RMS not only to attain high pressure
      amplitudes, but also to tailor the shapes and characteristics of
      waveforms to applications ranging from materials processing to
      pharmaceutical and chemical manufacturing to electric power
      generation. <br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      <b>Putting Sound to Work</b><br>
      <br>
      Lucas originally became interested in generating large-amplitude
      acoustic waves when he realized that such waves could drive
      acoustic compressors that, in turn, could be used in
      environmentally benign refrigerators and pumps. After founding
      Macrosonix to tackle the technical problems involved in generating
      and controlling high-amplitude sound waves, Lucas spent a year at
      Los Alamos National Laboratory, where he worked in the lab of
      acoustical physicist Greg Swift. Lucas and his collaborators at
      Macrosonix then worked for the next seven years to develop methods
      of modeling non-linear phenomena associated with high-amplitude
      waves, find resonator geometries likely to achieve high
      amplitudes, create efficient mechanical drivers for their
      resonators and finally to harness a variety of high-energy
      acoustic effects to perform power hungry tasks such as gas
      compression, pulverization and electric power generation. By 1996,
      they had developed an acoustic compressor suitable for a
      commercially viable (and, yes, fairly quiet) acoustical
      refrigerator. <br>
      <br>
      Developing viable acoustical technologies required a detailed
      understanding of the nonlinear phenomena associated with
      high-energy sound waves. Unfortunately most commercial software
      for acoustics implicitly assumes a small amplitude approximation.
      This forced the company to develop its own software for modeling
      the behavior of sound waves in cylindrically symmetric resonators.
      Beginning with conservation of mass and momentum (including
      viscous dissipation) and the state equation for an ideal gas, the
      team derived a set of coupled differential equations that could be
      solved numerically. As reported at the ASA conference, Lucas,
      Yurii Ilinksy, Bart Lipkens, Thomas Van Doren and Evgenia
      Zabolotskaya used the resulting model to predict the behavior of
      sound waves in a variety of resonators, including the horn-cone
      and others shaped like a cylinder, a cone and a bulb. The model
      was crucial for predicting which resonators were likely to avoid
      shocks at high pressure amplitudes. <br>
      <br>
      Shock waves tend to form when the relative phases of the wave’s
      harmonics and fundamental frequency assume certain values. RMS
      uses resonator geometry to force the phases and amplitudes of
      harmonics to assume values other than those characteristic of
      shocks. For example, in consonant resonators, like a simple
      cylindrical cavity, the wave’s harmonics coincide with the higher
      modes of the cavity, providing precisely the conditions needed to
      generate shocks. In dissonant resonators (such as a cone), modes
      are not equally spaced, and so harmonics are less likely to
      coincide with cavity modes. As a result, resonators that achieve
      high pressure amplitudes are most likely to be dissonant, although
      even many dissonant resonators produce sever shocks at low
      pressure amplitudes. Hence the importance of being able to
      accurately model the physical processes occurring within the
      resonator. <br>
      <br>
      The Macrosonix team also determined that efficient generation of
      high amplitude sound waves required a more effective method of
      driving the sound wave in the resonator. To effectively couple the
      mechanical motion of the driving force to the acoustic wave in the
      resonator, the team used a technique called entire-resonator
      drive, in which the resonator is shaken along its axis. In effect,
      this technique uses the entire inner surface of the resonator to
      drive the gas, rather than just a diaphragm of piston at one end,
      as was done in previous studies. As a result, entire resonator
      drive minimizes energy inefficiency. Even so, energy dissipation
      in the gas does raise its temperature and pressure, and therefore
      its sound speed and resonance frequency. Consequently, sensors in
      the cavity monitor the conditions in the gas and automatically
      adjust the drive frequency to remain on resonance. <br>
      <br>
      According to Lucas, a major (so far unnamed) manufacturer of
      appliances has already licensed an RMS-based compressor design for
      use in a refrigerator, which is expected to be available
      commercially within two years. Lucas is confident that a range of
      other applications will mature in the near future. At present,
      however, researchers in acoustics are as interested in the
      characteristics of the high-amplitude acoustic waves as they are
      in their applications. <br>
      <br>
      In the other paper presented by the company at the San Diego
      conference, Lucas, Van Doren, Lipkens, Christopher Lawrenson and
      David Perkins described measurements of waveforms and their
      dependence on driving-force amplitude and frequency (near
      resonance), as well as the effects of different gases on the
      waveform for a variety of resonator geometries, including
      cylindrical, conical, horn-cone and bulb. In general, regardless
      of the resonator, as the driving force (and therefore pressure
      amplitude) increased, the sound waves first changed from smooth to
      distorted sine waves, then developed ripples and finally
      discontinuous shock waves. However, resonator geometry was crucial
      in determining the pressure at which those transition occurred:
      Dissonant resonators achieved higher pressures than consonant
      resonators, and the horn-cone significantly outperformed the other
      dissonant resonators, as predicted by the Macrosonix model. The
      horn-cone was also more efficient at generating so-called DC
      pressure, a nonlinearly generated steady-state (nonoscillatory)
      pressure distribution that changes the local equilibrium pressure
      about which the sound waves oscillate. According to Lucas, such
      steady-state pressure differentials within the resonator up to 3.3
      atmospheres and can be used in valveless pumps and compressors, as
      well as to levitate heavy objects. <br>
      <br>
      The researchers also observed interesting hysteresis in which
      nonlinear processes in the gases caused an upward or downward
      shift in the resonance frequency as resonance was approached from
      below relative to that measured when resonance was approached from
      above. Moreover, whether the shift was null, upward or downward
      was determined by the resonator geometry, rather than by the
      properties of the gas. Indeed, aside from small differences in the
      pressures attained that depended on how nonideal the gas was, the
      waveforms looked the same for the three different gases
      investigated - R-134 (1,1,1,2-tetrafluroethane, a refrigerant),
      propane and nitrogen. This finding suggests that the same
      resonators may be used with different gases. <br>
      <br>
      <b>A Sound Future</b><br>
      <br>
      Although Macrosonix nature as a startup high-tech firm has forced
      Lucas and his collaborators to maintain an applied, technical
      focus, Lucas is excited about the prospects for RMS in basic
      research as well as in technology. "RMS is a primarily
      technology," he stresses. "This is the first technique capable of
      generating sound waves of such amplitudes. I can’t wait to see
      what other researchers will do with these techniques." If the
      reception given to the papers presented in San Diego is any
      indication, Lucas’s fellow researchers are equally enthusiastic
      about potential applications of RMS in their own areas of
      research. As Steve Garrett of Pennsylvania State University put
      it, "If he ever puts these in commercial fridges, I’d buy one,
      throw away the fridge and just keep the pump to do science."<br>

      &nbsp;Acoustic compressors replace most of the mechanical parts in
      conventional compressors with standing sound waves. During one
      acoustic cycle, the pressure oscillates from high (red) to low
      (blue). In the first part of the cycle (upper image), low pressure
      in the narrow portion of the resonator closes the discharge
      (upper) valve and opens the intake (lower) valve. Allowing
      low-pressure gas into the resonator. In the second part of the
      cycle (lower image), high pressure in the narrow portion of the
      resonator closes the intake valve and allows high-pressure gas to
      flow through the discharge valve. Because they use no oil and have
      few moving parts, acoustic compressors are expected to be clean
      and reliable.<br>

      Blowing across the lip of a bottle to produce that satisfying hum
      would not seem the basis for new discoveries. But that is
      essentially what Timothy S. Lucas claims he has made. Reporting at
      the Acoustical Society of America meeting last December, the
      founder and president of Macrosonix Corporation in Richmond, Va.,
      says his torpedo-shaped "bottles," when shaken back and forth
      hundreds of times a second, can create standing sound waves within
      them that pack energy densities 1,600 times greater than that
      previously achieved in acoustics. The process, which Lucas calls
      "Resonant Macrosonic Synthesis," can produce pressures exceeding
      3.5 million pascals (500 pounds per square inch), more than enough
      for industrial applications such as compressing and pumping. <br>
      <br>
      The key is the shape of the bottle, or resonator. In the past,
      resonators were often cylindrical, and shock waves formed inside
      them if they vibrated too quickly. A shock wave - a compression
      wave that delineates a sharp boundary between high and low
      pressures - dissipated energy, preventing the internal pressure
      from getting too high. As a result, driving the resonator faster -
      the equivalent of blowing harder across the top of a bottle -
      would no longer boost the volume the volume of the internal sound.

      <br>
      An acoustic resonator includes a chamber which contains a fluid.
      The chamber has a geometry which produces self-destructive
      interference of at least one harmonic in the fluid to avoid shock
      wave formation at finite acoustic pressure amplitudes. The chamber
      can have reflective terminations at each end or a reflective
      termination at only one end. A driver mechanically oscillates the
      chamber at a frequency of a selected resonant mode of the chamber.
      The driver may be a moving piston coupled to an open end of the
      chamber, an electromagnetic shaker or an electromagnetic driver.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>1) Field of Invention</b><br>
      <br>
      This invention relates to an acoustic resonator in which
      near-linear macrosonic waves are generated in a resonant acoustic
      chamber, having specific applications to resonant acoustic
      compressors.<br>
      <br>
      <b>2) Description of Related Art</b><br>
      <br>
      My earlier U.S. Pat. No. 5,020,977 is directed to a compressor for
      a compression-evaporation cooling system which employs acoustics
      for compression. The compressor is formed by a standing wave
      compressor including a chamber for holding a fluid refrigerant. A
      travelling wave is established in the fluid refrigerant in the
      chamber. This travelling wave is converted into a standing wave in
      the fluid refrigerant in the chamber so that the fluid refrigerant
      is compressed.<br>
      <br>
      Heretofore, the field of linear acoustics was limited primarily to
      the domain of small acoustic pressure amplitudes. When acoustic
      pressure amplitudes become large, compared to the average fluid
      pressure, nonlinearities result. Under these conditions a pure
      sine wave will normally evolve into a shock wave.<br>
      <br>
      Shock evolution is attributed to a spacial change in sound speed
      caused by the large variations in pressure, referred to as
      pressure steepening. During propagation the thermodynamic state of
      the pressure peak of a finite wave is quite different than its
      pressure minimum, resulting in different sound speeds along the
      extent of the wave. Consequently, the pressure peaks of the wave
      can overtake the pressure minimums and a shock wave evolves.<br>
      <br>
      Shock formation can occur for waves propagating in free space, in
      wave guides, and in acoustic resonators. The following
      publications focus on shock formation within various types of
      acoustic resonators.<br>
      <br>
      Temkin developed a method for calculating the pressure amplitude
      limit in piston-driven cylindrical resonators, due to shock
      formation (Samuel Temkin, "Propagating and standing sawtooth
      waves", J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 45, 224 (1969)). First he assumes the
      presence of left and right traveling shock waves in a resonator,
      and then finds the increase in entropy caused by the two shock
      waves. This entropy loss is substituted into an energy balance
      equation which is solved for limiting pressure amplitude as a
      function of driver displacement. Temkin's theory provided close
      agreement with experimentation for both traveling and standing
      waves of finite amplitude.<br>
      <br>
      Cruikshank provided a comparison of theory and experiment for
      finite amplitude acoustic oscillations in piston-driven
      cylindrical resonators (D. B. Cruikshank, "Experimental
      investigation of finite-amplitude acoustic oscillations in a
      closed tube", J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 52, 1024 (1972)). Cruikshank
      demonstrated close agreement between experimental and
      theoretically generated shock waveforms.<br>
      <br>
      Like much of the literature, the work of Temkin and Cruikshank
      both assume piston-driven cylindrical resonators of constant
      cross-sectional (CCS) area, with the termination of the tube being
      parallel to the piston face. CCS resonators will have harmonic
      modes which are coincident in frequency with the wave's harmonics,
      thus shock evolution is unrestricted. Although not stated in their
      papers, Temkin and Cruikshank's implicit assumption of a saw-tooth
      shock wave in their solutions is justified only for CCS
      resonators.<br>
      <br>
      For resonators with non-harmonic modes, the simple assumption of a
      sawtooth shock wave will no longer apply. This was shown by Weiner
      who also developed a method for approximating the limiting
      pressure amplitude in resonators, due to shock formation (Stephen
      Weiner, "Standing sound waves of finite amplitude", J. Acoust.
      Soc. Am. 40, 240 (1966)). Weiner begins by assuming the presence
      of a shock wave and then calculates the work done on the
      fundamental by the harmonics. This work is substituted into an
      energy balance equation which is solved for limiting pressure
      amplitude as a function of driver displacement.<br>
      <br>
      Weiner then goes on to show that attenuation of the even harmonics
      will result in a higher pressure amplitude limit for the
      fundamental. As an example of a resonator that causes even
      harmonic attenuation, he refers to a T shaped chamber called a "T
      burner" used for solid-propellent combustion research. The T
      burner acts as a thermally driven 1/2 wave length resonator with a
      vent at its center. Each even mode will have a pressure antinode
      at the vent, and thus experiences attenuation in the form of
      radiated energy through the vent. Weiner offers no suggestions,
      other than attenuation, for eliminating harmonics. Attenuation is
      the dissipation of energy, and thus is undesirable for energy
      efficiency.<br>
      <br>
      Further examples of harmonic attenuation schemes can be found in
      the literature of gas-combustion heating. (see for example, Abbot
      A. Putnam, Combustion-Driven Oscillations in Industry (American
      Elsevier Publishing Co., 1971)). Other examples can be found in
      the general field of noise control where attenuation-type schemes
      are also employed, since energy losses are of no importance. One
      notably different approach is the work of Oberst, who sought to
      generate intense sound for calibrating microphones (Hermann
      Oberst, "A method for the production of extremely powerful
      standing sound waves in air", Akust. Z. 5, 27 (1940)). Oberst
      found that the harmonic content of a finite amplitude wave was
      reduced by a resonator which had non-harmonic resonant modes. His
      resonator was formed by connecting two tubes of different
      diameter, with the smaller tube being terminated and the larger
      tube remaining open. The open end of the resonator was driven by
      an air jet which was modulated by a rotating aperture disk.<br>
      <br>
      With this arrangement, Oberst was able to produce resonant
      pressure amplitudes up to 0.10 bar for a driving pressure
      amplitude of 0.02 bar, giving a gain of 5 to the fundamental. The
      driving waveform, which had a 30% error (i.e. deviation from a
      sinusoid), was transformed to a waveform of only 5% error by the
      resonator. However, he predicted that if more acoustic power were
      applied, then nonlinear distortions would become clearly evident.
      In fact, harmonic content is visually noticeable in Oberst's
      waveforms corresponding to resonant pressure amplitudes of only
      0.005 bar.<br>
      <br>
      Oberst attributed the behavior of these finite amplitude waves, to
      the noncoincidence of the resonator modes and the wave harmonics.
      Yet, no explanations were offered as to the exact interaction
      between the resonator and the wave harmonics. Oberst's position
      seems to be that the reduced spectral density of the resonant wave
      is simply the result of comparatively little Q-amplification being
      imparted to the driving waveform harmonics. This explanation is
      only believable for the modest pressure amplitudes obtained by
      Oberst. Oberst provided no teachings or suggestions that his
      methods could produce linear pressure amplitudes above those which
      he achieved, and he offered no hope for further optimization. To
      the contrary, Oberst stated that nonlinearities would dominate at
      higher pressure amplitudes.<br>
      <br>
      A further source of nonlinearity in acoustic resonators is the
      boundary layer turbulence which can occur at high acoustic
      velocities. Merkli and Thomann showed experimentally that at
      finite pressure amplitudes, there is a critical point at which the
      oscillating laminar flow will become turbulent (P. Merkli, H.
      Thomann, "Transition to turbulence in oscillating pipe flow", J.
      Fluid Mech., 68, 567 (1975)). Their studies were also carried out
      in CCS resonators.<br>
      <br>
      Taken as a whole, the literature of finite resonant acoustics
      seems to predict that the inherent nonlinearites of fluids will
      ultimately dominate any resonant system, independent of the
      boundary conditions imposed by a resonator. The literature's
      prediction of these limits is far below the actual performance of
      the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      Therefore, there is a need in the art to efficiently generate very
      large shock-free acoustic pressure amplitudes as a means of gas
      compression for vapor-compression heat transfer systems of the
      type disclosed in my U.S. Pat. No. 5,020,977. Further, many other
      applications within the field of acoustics, such as thermoacoustic
      heat engines, can also benefit from the generation of high
      amplitude sinusoidal waveforms.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      It is an object of the present invention to provide acoustic
      resonators which eliminate shock formation by promoting the
      destructive self-interference of the harmonics of a wave, whereby
      near-linear acoustic pressures of extremely high amplitude can be
      achieved.<br>
      <br>
      It is another object of the present invention to provide acoustic
      resonators which minimize the nonlinear energy dissipation caused
      by the boundary layer turbulence of finite acoustic waves.<br>
      <br>
      It is a further object of the present invention to provide
      acoustic resonators which minimize boundary viscous energy
      dissipation and boundary thermal energy dissipation.<br>
      <br>
      It is a still further object of the present invention to provide
      an acoustic driving arrangement for achieving high acoustic
      pressure amplitudes.<br>
      <br>
      It is an even further object of the present invention to provide
      an acoustic resonator which can maintain near-sinusoidal pressure
      oscillations while being driven by harmonic-rich waveforms.<br>
      <br>
      The acoustic resonator of the present invention includes a chamber
      containing a fluid. The chamber has a geometry which produces
      destructive self interference of at least one harmonic in the
      fluid to avoid shock wave formation at finite acoustic pressure
      amplitudes. The chamber has a cross-sectional area which changes
      along the chamber, and the changing cross-sectional area is
      positioned along the chamber to reduce an acoustic velocity of the
      fluid and/or to reduce boundary viscous energy dissipation. The
      chamber may comprise a resonant chamber for a standing wave
      compressor used for fluid compression for heat transfer
      operations.<br>
      <br>
      The acoustic resonator driving system of the invention includes a
      chamber containing a fluid, wherein the chamber has acoustically
      reflective terminations at each end. A driver mechanically
      oscillates the chamber at a frequency of a selected resonant mode
      of the chamber. The acoustic resonator and drive system of the
      present invention may be connected to heat exchange apparatus so
      as to form a heat exchange system such as a vapor-compression
      system.<br>
      <br>
      As described above, the acoustic resonator and acoustic driving
      arrangement of the present invention provide a number of
      advantages and achieve non-linear acoustic pressures of extremely
      high amplitude. In particular, the actual performance of the
      present invention is far beyond the results predicted in the
      literature of finite resonant acoustics.<br>
      <br>
      These and other objects and advantages of the invention will
      become apparent from the accompanying specifications and drawings,
      wherein like reference numerals refer to like parts throughout.<br>

      <br>
      It is well known that "pressure steepening" at high acoustic
      pressure amplitudes leads to the classic sawtooth waveform of a
      shock wave. It is also understood that a sawtooth waveform
      implies, from Fourier analysis, the presence of harmonics.<br>
      <br>
      If finite amplitude acoustic waves are generated in a constant
      cross-sectional (CCS) resonator, a shock wave will appear having
      the harmonic amplitudes predicted by the Fourier analysis of a
      sawtooth waveform. At first this would not seem surprising, but it
      must be understood that a CCS resonator has modes which are
      harmonic (i.e. integer multiples of the fundamental) and which are
      coincident in frequency with the harmonics of the fundamental. CCS
      resonators can be considered as a special case of a more general
      class of resonators whose modes are non-harmonic. Non-harmonic
      resonators hold a previously unharnessed potential for providing
      extremely high amplitude linear waves. This potential is realized
      by non-harmonic resonators which are designed to promote the
      self-destructive interference of the harmonics of the fundamental.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention employs this principle and provides a new
      resonator design criterion; to optimize the self-cancellation of
      wave harmonics. This new design criterion for
      mode-alignment-canceled harmonics (MACH) eliminates shock
      formation. MACH resonators have achieved pressure amplitudes of
      100 psi peak-to-peak, with mean pressures of 80 psia, without
      shock formation. This translates into a peak acoustic pressure
      amplitude which is 62% of the mean pressure.<br>
      <br>
      Once the MACH design criterion is understood, many different
      resonator geometries can be employed for aligning a resonator's
      higher mode to promote self-cancellation of harmonics. A
      straightforward approach for exploiting the MACH principle is to
      align resonator modes to fall between their corresponding
      harmonics.<br>
      <br>
      The bar graph of FIG. 1 illustrates the relationship between the
      harmonics of the fundamental and the resonator modes for a CCS 1/2
      wave length resonator. The vertical axis marks the wave harmonics
      of the wave, and the bar height gives the resonant frequency of
      the mode. At a fundamental frequency of 100 Hz the wave will have
      harmonics at 200 Hz, 300 Hz, 400 Hz, etc. From FIG. 1 it can be
      seen that the harmonics of the wave are coincident in frequency
      with the modes of the resonator. Stated differently, the nth
      harmonic of the wave is coincident with the nth mode of the
      resonator. Consequently, little or no self-destructive
      interference of the wave harmonics will occur, and a shock wave
      can evolve without restriction. For a well developed shock wave,
      the pressure amplitude of the 2nd harmonic will be within 6 dB of
      the fundamental's amplitude.<br>
      <br>
      The bar graph of FIG. 2 illustrates one of many possible
      arrangements for promoting the destructive self-interference of
      harmonics. In FIG. 2, the resonator modes are aligned to fall
      between the wave harmonics. For this example, the resonator modes
      have been shifted down in frequency so that the nth mode lies
      between harmonics n and n-1. With this arrangement a large degree
      of destructive self-interference of the wave harmonics can occur.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 3 is a sectional view of a resonator which was constructed
      and tested, and whose modes are shifted down in frequency. The
      resonator in FIG. 3 is formed by a hollow cylindrical chamber 2,
      an end flange 4, an end flange 6, and tapered rod insert 8, with
      all parts being aluminum. Tapered rod insert 8 was welded to end
      flange 4 with end flange 4 being welded to chamber 2. End flange 6
      was welded to chamber 2, and was drilled to accommodate a process
      tube and a pressure transducer. Chamber 2 has an inside diameter
      of 5.71 cm, and an inside length of 27 cm. Tapered rod insert 8
      has a half-angle end taper of 34.98 DEG, and a length of 10 cm,
      measured from end flange 4. Sharp edges on tapered rod insert 8
      were rounded off to an arbitrary curvature to reduce turbulence.<br>
      <br>
      Tapered rod insert 8 serves to create a smaller cross-sectional
      area along its length inside of chamber 2. In this way, the
      resonator of FIG. 3 is divided into two sections of different
      cross-sectional area, each section having its own acoustical
      impedance. This impedance change results in a shifting of the
      resonator modes to non-harmonic frequencies. The degree to which
      the modes are shifted can be controlled by varying the diameter
      and length of tapered rod insert 8. The manner in which the
      resonator is driven is described below.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 4 is a table of measured data obtained for the resonator of
      FIG. 3. The last column provides a relative measure of the degree
      of mode shift, by calculating the difference between the frequency
      "fn " of the nth mode and n times the fundamental frequency "nf1."
      The ideal mode shift, for placing the resonator modes at the
      midpoints between neighboring harmonics, is equal to 1/2 the
      fundamental frequency. For the FIG. 3 resonator, the ideal shift
      is f1 /2=166.97 Hz. For CCS resonators, the mode shift fn -nf1 =0
      for each mode by definition.<br>
      <br>
      The resonator design of FIG. 3 does not provide ideal mode shifts,
      but comes close enough to provide significant results. This is due
      to the fact that the Fourier sum of the first few harmonics
      contributes heavily to shock formation. Thus, significant
      cancellation of the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th harmonics will reduce shock
      formation greatly. When the resonator of FIG. 3 was pressurized to
      80 psia with gaseous refrigerant HFC-134a, 11.8 Watts of acoustic
      input power was required to achieve a 42 psia peak-to-peak
      pressure amplitude (measured at end flange 4). This is within 30%
      of the required driving power predicted by a strictly linear
      theory which accounts for only thermal and viscous boundary layer
      losses. At these operating conditions the amplitude of the 2nd
      harmonic was 20 dB down from the fundamental, with higher
      harmonics being down 30 dB or more.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 5 is a table of theoretical data which was generated for the
      FIG. 3 resonator. Ideally, fn -nf1 should be approximately equal
      to the ideal shift for each of the resonator modes. However, it
      can be seen in FIG. 5 that the degree of mode shifting increases
      with mode number. At the 6th mode, shifting has increased so much
      that the mode frequency is now nearly coincident with the 5th
      harmonic of the wave. With more advanced resonator designs, many
      modes can be simultaneously tuned to lie between the wave
      harmonics. As the number of properly tuned modes increases, the
      resonator's linearity increases.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 6 is a sectional view of another resonator which was
      constructed and tested. The resonator in FIG. 6 has a chamber
      which is formed by a small diameter section 10, a conical section
      12, a large diameter section 14, a conical taper 16, and an end
      flange 18. The chamber comprising the small diameter section 10,
      the conical section 12, the large diameter section 14, and the
      conical taper 16 were all machined from a single piece of
      aluminum. Aluminum end flange 18 was welded to conical end taper
      16. Small diameter section 10 has a length of 7.28 cm and a
      diameter of 3.81 cm. Conical section 12 has a half-angle of 25.63
      DEG and an inside length of 3.72 cm. Large diameter section 14 has
      an inside length of 13.16 cm and an inside diameter of 7.38 cm.
      Conical taper 16 has a half-angle of 26.08 DEG and an inside
      length of 2.84 cm. Section 10 and section 14 divide the resonator
      into two sections of different cross-sectional area, each section
      having its own acoustical impedance. This design results in a
      downward shifting of the resonator modes to non-harmonic
      frequencies.<br>
      <br>
      The FIG. 6 resonator eliminates the tapered rod insert of FIG. 3,
      thereby reducing the internal surface area of the resonator, which
      in turn reduces the thermal and viscous boundary layer losses. The
      degree to which the modes are shifted can be controlled by varying
      the dimensions of section 10, section 14, conical section 12, and
      taper 16. Taper 16 compensates for excessive downward shifting of
      the higher modes, by shifting primarily the higher modes up in
      frequency. The manner in which the resonator is driven is
      described below.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 7 and FIG. 8 are tables of the measured data and theoretical
      data, respectively, for the resonator of FIG. 6. In comparison
      with the FIG. 3 resonator, the FIG. 6 resonator has improved the
      tuning of the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th modes, as well as reduced the
      excessive shifting of higher modes. The FIG. 6 resonator brings
      the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th modes much closer to the ideal shift, and
      results in improved performance.<br>
      <br>
      When the resonator of FIG. 6 was pressurized to 80 psia, with
      gaseous refrigerant HFC-134a, pressure amplitudes of up to 100 psi
      peak-to-peak (measured at an end 10a of small diameter section 10)
      were achieved without shock formation. However, turbulence was
      evident, indicating that the acoustic velocity was high enough to
      cause non-laminar flow. As shown below, resonator geometry can be
      altered to greatly reduce acoustic velocity. At 60 psi
      peak-to-peak (measured at the end 10a of small diameter section
      10) all harmonics were more than 25 dB down from the amplitude of
      the fundamental, for the FIG. 6 resonator.<br>
      <br>
      In general, the modes of a given resonator geometry can be
      calculated from the general solution of the wave equation written
      for both pressure and velocity:<br>
      P(x)=Acos (kx)+Bsin (kx)<br>
      V(x)=i/(pc)(Acos (kx)+Bsin (kx))<br>
      <br>
      where i=(-1)@1/2, p=average fluid density, c=speed of sound. The
      arbitrary complex constants A and B are found by applying the
      boundary conditions of the resonator to the above equations for
      P(x) and V(x). Resonators embodying the present invention were
      designed by iterating P(x) and V(x) in the frequency domain across
      finite elements of the resonator, until zero velocity is reached
      at the resonator's end. As demonstrated above, the mid-harmonic
      placement of resonator modes provides one of many ways to exploit
      the MACH principle. For more exact predictions of harmonic
      cancellation, the harmonics can be treated as waves traveling
      within the boundaries of the resonator, while accounting for their
      self-interference. The goal of which is to show harmonic
      self-cancellation as a function of changes in the resonator
      geometry.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Importance of the MACH Principle</b><br>
      <br>
      It is revealing to compare the performance of MACH resonators with
      that of CCS resonators which do not restrict shock formation. As a
      comparison, consider the normal evolution to shock formation which
      occurs as a finite amplitude wave propagates. Using the method of
      Pierce, it is possible to calculate the distance a 60 psi
      peak-to-peak pressure wave must travel for a fully developed shock
      wave to evolve (Allan D. Pierce, Acoustics, p. 571 (Acoustical
      Society of America 1989)). For a mean pressure of 80 psia (in
      gaseous HFC-134a), the waveform will evolve from a sinusoid to a
      shock after traveling only 22 cm, which is less than one traverse
      of the 27 cm length of the FIG. 6 resonator! From this it is easy
      to appreciate the longstanding assumption that at extremely high
      amplitudes, intrinsic nonlinearities of a gas will dominate any
      resonator design considerations.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Other Resonator Design Parameters</b><br>
      <br>
      To efficiently create high amplitude resonant acoustic waves, it
      is important to keep the resonator boundary layer viscous and
      thermal losses as low as possible. Also, the acoustic velocity
      associated with a desired pressure amplitude should be minimized
      to avoid excessive turbulence.<br>
      <br>
      For a pure sinusoidal standing wave in a resonator of constant
      cross-sectional area, the peak acoustic velocity is equal to
      P/(pc), where P.ident.peak acoustic pressure amplitude,
      p.ident.average fluid density, and c.ident.speed of sound at the
      average pressure. In practice, the peak acoustic velocity can be
      decreased by the proper resonator geometry. For example, the
      resonator of FIG. 6 has a peak acoustic velocity equal to
      0.82(P/(pc)) (P being measured at the end 10a of small diameter
      section 10), due to the expansion at the center of the chamber
      provided by conical section 12. This increase in cross-sectional
      area occurs just before the velocity maxima at the center of the
      chamber, thereby lowering the acoustic velocity.<br>
      <br>
      Expansions, like those of the FIG. 6 resonator, have other
      advantages as well. When the acoustic velocity is reduced,
      boundary layer viscous losses are reduced. Also, the expansion
      reduces the peak acoustic pressure amplitude at end flange 18,
      thereby reducing boundary layer thermal losses at this end of the
      resonator. Similarly, the expansion provided by end taper 16 of
      FIG. 6 further reduces the boundary layer thermal losses. When the
      position of an expansion, like conical section 12 of FIG. 6, is
      varied along the length of the resonator, the boundary layer
      thermal losses and the boundary layer viscous losses will vary. It
      has been found theoretically that the sum of these losses reaches
      a minimum when the expansion is centered at approximately 0.3 of
      the length of the resonator.<br>
      <br>
      In general, practical energy efficient resonator designs require a
      compromise between mode tuning for harmonic cancellation,
      minimizing acoustic velocity, and minimizing thermal and viscous
      losses. FIG. 9 is a sectional view of a resonator which represents
      one of a vast number of possible compromises between these design
      parameters.<br>
      <br>
      The FIG. 9 resonator chamber has a conical expansion section 20, a
      curved expansion section 22, a curved end taper section 24, and an
      end flange 28. Ports 21a, 21b, such as an inlet and outlet or
      valves, are provided at an end 20a of the resonator. Although not
      shown, such ports are also provided in the resonators of FIGS. 3
      and 6. The resonator chamber is preferably formed by a low thermal
      conductivity material such as fiberglass, since this will reduce
      the boundary layer thermal losses. However, any material, such as
      aluminum, which can be formed into a desired configuration can be
      used. The FIG. 9 resonator is similar in principle to the FIG. 6
      resonator in its method of modal tuning, except for the curved
      sections which provide greater mode tuning selectivity. This
      selectivity is due to the varying rate of change of
      cross-sectional area provided by the curved sections, which is
      explained as follows. The magnitude of frequency shift of a mode,
      caused by a given area change, depends on which part of the
      standing wave pattern encounters the area change. Each of the many
      superimposed standing wave patterns in a resonator will encounter
      a fixed area change at a different point along its wave pattern.
      Thus, an area change which tunes one mode properly may cause
      unfavorable tuning for another mode. Curved sections can provide
      compensation for this unfavorable tuning by exposing different
      modes to different rates of area change. The term "curved section"
      is not intended to refer to a specific mathematical surface.
      Rather, the term "curved section" is understood to mean in general
      any section which provides a rate of change of area, as a function
      of the longitudinal dimension, whose derivative is non-zero. Any
      number of mathematical surfaces can be employed. It is
      contemplated that one possible set of equations for the curved
      expansion section 22 and curved end tapered section 24 could be as
      follows.<br>
      <br>
      In FIG. 9 the constant diameter section at end 20a of the
      resonator has an inner diameter of 2.54 cm and is 4.86 cm long.
      Conical expansion section 20 is 4.1 cm long and has a 5.8 DEG
      half-angle. Curved expansion section 22 is 3.68 cm long. To the
      right of curved section 22, the diameter remains constant at 5.77
      cm over a distance of 11.34 cm. Curved end taper 24 is 2.16 cm
      long. To the right of curved end taper 24, the diameter remains
      constant at 13 cm over a distance of 0.86 cm. Curved expansion
      section 22 was described in a finite element program by the
      equation Dn =Dn-1 +0.00003(7+n), and curved end taper 24 was
      described by the equation Dn =Dn-1 +0.00038(n), where Dn .ident.
      the diameter of the current element, and Dn-1 .ident. the diameter
      of the previous element, and with each element having a length
      0.00108 meters.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 10 is a table of theoretical data for the FIG. 9 resonator,
      which shows that the point at which modes and harmonics overlap in
      frequency has been significantly extended to higher frequencies.<br>
      <br>
      The FIG. 9 resonator also reduces the acoustic velocity to a value
      of 0.58 (P/(pc)) (P being measured at a small diameter end 20a of
      the resonator), which represents a significant reduction in
      acoustic velocity for the desired pressure amplitude. In addition,
      the FIG. 9 resonator reduces the total thermal and viscous energy
      dissipation of the FIG. 6 resonator by a factor of 1.50.
      Neglecting turbulent losses, the total rate of thermal and viscous
      energy loss, at a given pressure amplitude, is equal to the
      acoustic input power required to sustain that pressure amplitude.
      Thus, reducing thermal and viscous energy losses will increase
      energy efficiency.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Half-Peak Entire-Resonator Driving</b><br>
      <br>
      The odd modes of a resonator can be effectively driven by
      mechanically oscillating the entire resonator along its
      longitudinal axis. This is the preferred method used by the
      resonators of the present invention. Although the resonators of
      FIG. 3, FIG. 6, and FIG. 9 could be driven by coupling a moving
      piston to an open-ended resonator, this approach has certain
      disadvantages which are avoided by the entire resonator driving
      method.<br>
      <br>
      Entire resonator driving can be understood as follows. If the
      entire resonator is oscillated along its longitudinal axis, then
      the end caps will act as pistons. The odd mode pressure
      oscillations at the two opposite ends of a double-terminated
      resonator will be 180 DEG out of phase with each other.
      Consequently, when the entire resonator is oscillated, its end
      caps, or terminations, can be used to drive an odd mode in the
      proper phase at each end of the resonator. In this way, the
      fundamental mode can be effectively driven.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 11 is a sectional view of one of many approaches which can be
      used to drive an entire resonator. In FIG. 11 an electrodynamic
      shaker or driver 29 is provided, having a current conducting coil
      26 rigidly attached to end flange 28 of resonator 34, and
      occupying air gap 30 of magnet 32. Magnet 32 is attached to end
      flange 28 by a flexible bellows 36. Bellows 36 maintains proper
      alignment of coil 26 within air gap 30.<br>
      <br>
      When coil 26 is energized by an oscillating current, the resulting
      electromagnetic forces will cause resonator 34 to be mechanically
      oscillated along its longitudinal axis. Magnet 32 can be rigidly
      restrained so as to have infinite mass relative to resonator 34.
      In the preferred embodiment, magnet 32 is left unrestrained and
      thus free to move in opposition to resonator 34. In either case,
      an appropriate spring constant can be chosen for bellows 36 to
      produce a mechanical resonance equal to the acoustic resonance,
      resulting in higher electro-acoustic efficiency. Bellows 36 could
      be replaced by other components such as flexible diaphragms,
      magnetic springs, or more conventional springs made of appropriate
      materials.<br>
      <br>
      Entire resonator driving reduces the mechanical displacement
      required to achieve a given pressure amplitude. When driving the
      entire resonator, both ends of the resonator act as pistons. In
      most cases, entire resonator driving requires roughly half the
      peak mechanical displacement which would be needed for a single
      coupled-piston arrangement.<br>
      <br>
      Half-Peak Entire-Resonator (HPER) driving provides the following
      advantages. As discussed above, the proper tuning of modes of a
      chamber is critical to efficiently achieving high acoustic
      pressure amplitudes. It follows that this tuning must remain
      constant during operation. Resonators which are terminated on both
      ends will maintain precise tuning during operation and throughout
      the lifetime of the resonator.<br>
      <br>
      A further advantage relates to the use of HPER driving for
      acoustic compressors. Since HPER driven chambers are sealed, there
      are no oil-dependant moving parts that come in contact with the
      fluid being compressed; resulting in an inherently oil-free
      compressor. The suction and discharge valves needed for acoustic
      compressors would typically be placed at the narrow end of a
      resonator, where the pressure amplitudes are the greatest. For
      example, valve placement for the resonator of FIG. 9 would be
      positioned at ports 21a, 21b at end 20a. The ratio of pressure
      amplitudes at the two ends of the FIG. 9 resonator is
      approximately 3:1 (left to right).<br>
      <br>
      <b>Non-Sinusoidal Driving</b><br>
      <br>
      As discussed above, a properly designed MACH chamber will cause
      the higher harmonics of its fundamental to be self canceling. For
      the same reason, a MACH chamber will tend to cancel out harmonics
      which may be present in the driver's displacement waveform. Thus,
      MACH chambers can convert a non-sinusoidal driving displacement
      into a sinusoidal pressure oscillation. In addition, any
      mechanical resonance present in a driver, like the driver of FIG.
      11, would tend to convert a non-sinusoidal driving current into a
      sinusoidal displacement waveform.<br>
      <br>
      In some applications, the use of non-sinusoidal driving signals
      can result in greater overall efficiency. For example, the power
      amplifiers needed for driving linear motors can be designed to
      operate very efficiently in a pulsed output mode. Current pulses
      can be timed to occur once every acoustic cycle or to skip several
      acoustic cycles.<br>
      <br>
      Another type of non-sinusoidal driving, which MACH chambers can
      facilitate, is a fluid's direct absorption of electromagnetic
      energy, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,020,977, the entire
      content of which is hereby incorporated by reference. Pulsed
      microwave and infrared energy, when passed through an absorptive
      fluid, will create acoustic waves in the fluid. This
      electromagnetic-to-acoustic conversion will tend to result in very
      harmonic-rich acoustic waves. MACH chambers will tend to cancel
      the resulting harmonics, thereby promoting a sinusoidal pressure
      oscillation. Electromagnetic pulses can be timed to occur once per
      acoustic cycle, or to skip several acoustic cycles.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Porous Materials</b><br>
      <br>
      Porous materials, such as sintered metals, ceramics, and wire mesh
      screensare commonly used in the field of noise control. Porous
      materials can provide acoustic transmission and refection
      coefficients which vary as a function of frequency and acoustic
      velocity. Properly placed within a resonator, these materials can
      be used as an aid to mode tuning.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 12 is a sectional view of a resonator 34 illustrating one of
      many possible uses of porous materials. In FIG. 12 a porous
      material 38 is rigidly mounted near end flange 28 of resonator 34.
      Porous material 38 will have a minimal effect on the fundamental
      of the resonator, whose acoustic velocity becomes small near the
      surface of end flange 28. The higher modes of the resonator can
      have velocity maxima near the position of porous material 38.
      Thus, the higher harmonics of the wave can experience larger
      reflection coefficients at the porous material and be reflected so
      as to promote destructive self-interference. Tuning can be
      adjusted by varying the position of porous material 38 along the
      length of resonator 34.<br>
      <br>
      In this way, a porous material can be used as an aid in optimizing
      the destructive self-interference of harmonics. The design
      flexibility provided by porous materials allows more aggressive
      optimization of specific resonator parameters, such as reducing
      the fundamental's acoustic velocity, without losing the desired
      mode tuning.<br>
      <br>
      For microwave driven resonators, porous material 38 could also act
      together with end flange 28 to form a microwave cavity for the
      introduction of microwave energy into resonator 34. FIG. 12
      illustrates an electromagnetic driver 39 coupled to the resonator
      34 by a coaxial cable 41 having a loop termination 41a inside the
      resonator 34 in the area between the porous material 38 and end
      flange 28. The microwave energy would be restricted to the area
      between porous material 38 and end flange 28.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 13 is a sectional view of resonator 34 and drive apparatus 29
      as used in a heat exchange system. In this case, ports 34a and 34b
      of resonator 34 are connected to a heat exchange apparatus 45 via
      conduits 47 and 49. Port 34a is provided with a discharge valve
      52, and port 34b is provided with a suction valve 54. Discharge
      valve 52 and suction valve 54 will convert the oscillating
      pressure within resonator 34, into a net fluid flow through heat
      exchange apparatus 45. The heat exchange apparatus may include,
      for example, a conventional condenser and evaporator, so that the
      heat exchange system of FIG. 13 may form a vapor-compression
      system.<br>
      <br>
      While the above description contains many specifications, these
      should not be construed as limitations on the scope of the
      invention, but rather as an exemplification of one preferred
      embodiment thereof. This preferred embodiment is based on my
      recognition that acoustic resonators can provide significant
      self-cancellation of harmonics, thereby providing extremely high
      amplitude acoustic waves without shock formation. The invention is
      also based on my recognition that other nonlinearities associated
      with finite amplitude waves, such as turbulence and boundary layer
      losses, can be reduced by proper resonator design.<br>
      <br>
      Application of the MACH principle can provide nearly complete
      cancellation of wave harmonics. However, the present invention is
      not limited to resonators which provide complete cancellation. As
      shown in the above specifications, cancellation of a harmonic need
      not be complete to obtain shock-free high amplitude acoustic
      waves. Nor do all harmonics need to be canceled. There is a
      continuous range of partial harmonic cancellation which can be
      practiced. Harmonics can be present without shock formation, as
      long as their amplitudes are sufficiently small. Resonators which
      cancel one, two, or many harmonics could all be considered
      satisfactory, depending on the requirements of a particular
      application. Thus, the scope of the invention is not limited to
      any one specific resonator design.<br>
      <br>
      There are many ways to exploit the basic features of the present
      invention which will readily occur to those skilled in the art.
      For example, shifting resonator modes to the midpoint between
      adjacent harmonics is only one of many ways to exploit the MACH
      principle. Resonator modes can be shifted to any degree as long as
      adequate self-destructive interference is provided for a given
      application.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, many different resonator geometries can support
      standing waves and can be tuned to exploit the MACH principle. For
      example, a toroidal resonator can be tuned by using methods
      similar to the embodiments of the present invention. Although the
      present specification describes resonators whose modes are shifted
      down in frequency, similar resonator designs can shift modes up in
      frequency. For example, if the diameters of section 10 and section
      14 in FIG. 6 are exchanged, then the resonator's modes will be
      shifted up in frequency rather than down. Furthermore, resonators
      can be designed to operate in resonant modes other than the
      fundamental, while still exploiting the MACH principle. Still
      further, the shock suppression provided by MACH resonators will
      occur for both liquids and gases.<br>
      <br>
      Also, it is understood that the application of MACH resonators to
      acoustic compressors is not limited to vapor-compression heat
      transfer systems, but can be applied to any number of general
      applications where fluids must be compressed. For example, there
      are many industrial applications where oil-free compressors are
      required in order to prevent contamination of a fluid. Finally,
      many different drivers can be used with HPER driven resonators.
      For example, electromagnetic and piezoceramic drivers can also
      provide the forces required for entire resonator driving. In
      short, any driver that mechanically oscillates the entire
      resonator and provides the required forces can be used.<br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, the scope of the invention should be determined not
      by the embodiments illustrated, but by the appended claims and
      their equivalents.<br>

      Abstract -- An acoustic resonator includes a chamber containing a
      fluid. The chamber has anharmonic resonant modes and provides
      boundary conditions which predetermine the harmonic phases and
      amplitudes needed to synthesize a non-sinusoidal, unshocked
      waveform.<br>
      <br>
      <b>1) Field of Invention</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      This invention relates to acoustic resonators which are designed
      to provide the specific harmonic phases and amplitudes required to
      predetermine the waveform of extremely large acoustic pressure
      oscillations, having specific applications to acoustic
      compressors.<br>
      <br>
      <b>2) Description of Related Art</b><br>
      <br>
      It is well known in the field of acoustics that when acoustic
      pressure amplitudes are finite compared to the medium's
      undisturbed ambient pressure, the resulting nonlinear effects will
      generate sound waves at harmonics of the fundamental frequency. We
      will hereafter refer to these nonlinearly generated sound waves as
      harmonics.<br>
      <br>
      For both traveling and standing waves, the presence of high
      amplitude harmonics is associated with the formation of shock
      waves, which severely limit a wave's peak-to-peak pressure
      amplitude. Shock formation requires harmonic amplitudes that are
      significant relative to the amplitude of the sound wave at the
      fundamental frequency. We will hereafter refer to these as high
      relative amplitude harmonics.<br>
      <br>
      For finite amplitude traveling waves, the harmonic relative
      amplitudes will depend primarily on the nonlinear properties of
      the medium. For finite amplitude standing waves occurring in a
      resonant cavity the harmonic relative amplitudes will likewise
      depend on the medium, but also are strongly influenced by the
      resonator's boundary conditions. The boundary conditions of the
      resonator are determined by the geometry of the walls and by the
      acoustical properties of the wall material and the fluid in the
      resonator.<br>
      <br>
      As explained in U.S. Pat. No. 5,319,938, acoustic resonators can
      now be designed which provide very large and nearly sinusoidal
      pressure oscillations. FIG. 1 shows the waveform of a sinusoidal
      pressure wave. A sinusoidal wave is pressure symmetric implying
      that P+ = P- , where P+ and P- are the maximum positive and
      negative pressure amplitudes respectively. If a sinusoidal
      pressure oscillation is generated in a resonator having an ambient
      pressure P0, then (P0 + P+ ) cannot exceed 2P0, since otherwise
      the pressure symmetry would require that (P0 - P- ) be less than
      zero absolute, which is impossible. Thus, the maximum peak-to-peak
      pressure a sinusoidal oscillation can provide is 2P0. This ignores
      any changes in the ambient pressure caused by nonlinear processes
      driven by the acoustic pressures.<br>
      <br>
      The '938 patent provides shock-free waves by preventing formation
      of high relative amplitude harmonics. However, there are acoustic
      resonator applications where the resulting sinusoidal waveforms
      present a limitation. For example, resonators used in acoustic
      compressors must at times provide compressions requiring P+ to be
      larger than P0 by a factor of 3 or more. An acoustic compressor
      used in low-temperature Rankine-cycle applications may require P+
      to exceed 215 psia for a P0 of only 70 psia. The acoustic wave
      needed to fit these conditions would require an extreme pressure
      asymmetry (about the ambient pressure P0) between P- and P+.<br>
      <br>
      Previously, the generation of resonant pressure-asymmetric waves
      presented specific unsolved problems. For a waveform to deviate
      significantly from a sinusoid, it must contain high relative
      amplitude harmonics. These harmonics would normally be expected to
      lead to shock formation, which can critically limit peak-to-peak
      pressure amplitudes as well as cause excessive energy dissipation.<br>
      <br>
      Resonant acoustic waves have been studied theoretically and
      experimentally. With respect to the present invention, these
      studies can be grouped into two categories: (i) harmonic
      resonators driven off-resonance, and (ii) anharmonic resonators
      driven on-resonance.<br>
      <br>
      A resonator is defined as "harmonic" when it has a set of standing
      wave mode frequencies that are integer multiples of another
      resonance frequency. For the following discussions only
      longitudinal resonant modes are considered. Harmonically tuned
      resonators produce shock waves if finite amplitude acoustic waves
      are excited at a resonance frequency. For this reason harmonic
      resonator studies which examine non-sinusoidal, non-shocked
      waveforms focus primarily on waveforms produced at frequencies
      off-resonance. Driving a resonator off-resonance severely limits
      the peak-to-peak pressure amplitudes attainable.<br>
      <br>
      The following references are representative of the harmonic
      resonator studies: (W. Chester, "Resonant oscillations in closed
      tubes," J. Fluid Mech. 18, 44-64 (1964)), (A. P. Coppens and J. V.
      Sanders, "Finite-amplitude standing waves in rigid-walled tubes,"
      J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 43, 516-529 (1968)), (D. B. Cruikshank, Jr.,
      "Experimental investigations of finite-amplitude acoustic
      oscillations in a closed tube," J. Acoust Soc. Am. 43, 1024-1036
      (1972)) and (P. Merkli, H. Thoman, "Thermoacoustic effects in a
      resonance tube," J. Fluid Mech. 70, 1161-177 (1975))<br>
      <br>
      A resonator is defined as "anharmonic" when its does not have a
      set of standing wave mode frequencies that are integer multiples
      of another resonance frequency. Studies of anharmonic resonators
      driven on-resonance are usually motivated by applications in which
      the elimination of high relative amplitude harmonics is necessary.
      For example, thermoacoustic engine resonators require high
      amplitude sine waves, and thus are designed for the greatest
      possible reduction of harmonic amplitudes. An example of such a
      study can be found in the work of D. Felipe Gaitan and Anthony A.
      Atchley (D. F. Gaitan and A. A. Atchley, "Finite amplitude
      standing waves in harmonic and anharmonic tubes," J. Acoust. Soc.
      Am. 93,2489-2495 (1993)).<br>
      <br>
      Gaitan and Atchley provide anharmonic resonators by using
      geometries with sections of different diameter. The area changes
      occurred over a distance that was small compared to the length of
      the resonator. As explained in U.S. Pat. No. 5,319,938 this
      approach tends to provide significant suppression of the wave's
      harmonics, thus providing sinusoidal waveforms.<br>
      <br>
      In summary, those resonators driven on-resonance at finite
      amplitudes either produced sinusoidal waves or shock waves.
      Resonators driven off-resonance resulted in very low peak-to-peak
      pressure amplitudes.<br>
      <br>
      The ability to provide high peak-to-peak pressure amplitude,
      non-sinusoidal, unshocked waves of a desired waveform would
      represent a significant advance for high compression acoustic
      resonators. Such waveforms require high relative amplitude
      harmonics to exist when the resonator is excited at a resonant
      frequency.<br>
      <br>
      Consequently, there exists a need for resonators that can
      synthesize unshocked waveforms at high pressure amplitudes.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      It is an object of the present invention to provide acoustic
      resonators whose boundary conditions maintain the predetermined
      harmonic phases and amplitudes needed to synthesize a desired
      waveform.<br>
      <br>
      A further object of the present invention is to provide acoustic
      resonators whose boundary conditions are designed to exploit the
      relative phases of harmonics as a means to dramatically extend the
      pressure amplitude shock-limit normally associated with high
      relative amplitude harmonics.<br>
      <br>
      A still further object of the present invention is to provide
      extremely high-amplitude pressure-asymmetric waves at resonance.<br>
      <br>
      The acoustic resonator of the present invention includes a chamber
      containing a fluid. A chamber's geometry, as well as the acoustic
      properties of the chamber wall material and the fluid, creates the
      boundary conditions needed to produce the harmonic phases and
      amplitudes of a predetermined waveform. The chambers have a
      continuously varying cross-sectional area in order to avoid
      turbulence due to high acoustic particle velocities, and in order
      to allow high relative amplitude harmonics.<br>
      <br>
      The acoustic resonators of the invention can be used in acoustic
      compressors to provide large compressions for various
      applications, such as heat exchange systems.<br>
      <br>
      As described above, the acoustic resonators of the present
      invention provide a number of advantages and can achieve
      peak-to-peak acoustic pressure amplitudes which are many times
      higher than the medium's ambient pressure. In particular, it is a
      surprising advantage that these extremely high amplitude pressure
      oscillations, which have precisely controlled waveforms, can be
      provided with very simple resonator geometries.<br>
      <br>
      These and other objects and advantages of the invention will
      become apparent from the accompanying specifications and drawings,
      wherein like reference numerals refer to like parts throughout.<br>

      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Anharmonic resonators having localized impedance changes</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      As described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,319,938, anharmonic resonators
      with abrupt changes in cross sectional area will significantly
      reduce the relative amplitudes of the harmonics. These abrupt
      changes in area introduce a localized acoustic impedance change
      within the resonator. An example of an abrupt impedance change is
      shown in FIG. 5, where a resonator 2 is formed by joining a large
      diameter section 4 to a small diameter section 6. This abrupt
      change in cross sectional area creates an impedance step 8, which
      is highly localized with respect to the resonator's length.<br>
      <br>
      Since localized impedance change (LI hereafter means Localized
      Impedance change) resonators tend to maintain harmonics at low
      relative amplitude, the waveform remains substantially sinusoidal.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Anharmonic resonators having distributed impedance changes</b><br>
      <br>
      The preferred embodiment of the present invention includes a
      resonator having a distributed impedance change (DI hereafter
      means Distributed Impedance change). Unlike LI resonators, DI
      resonators can easily allow high relative amplitude harmonics to
      exist.<br>
      <br>
      The resonators shown in FIGS. 5, 6, 7, 9, 11 and 13 illustrate the
      differences between LI and DI resonators. FIG. 6 shows a resonator
      10 which is reproduced from FIG. 6 of U.S. Pat. No. 5,319,938.
      Resonator 10 includes conical section 16 which joins large
      diameter section 12 to small diameter section 14. Unlike the
      resonator of FIG. 5, this change in cross sectional area is not
      completely localized, but is partially distributed. This partially
      distributed area change results in a partially distributed
      impedance change, which occurs along the length of conical section
      16.<br>
      <br>
      Here, and throughout, the term partially distributed is used to
      imply less than the entire length of the resonator. The terms LI
      and DI are not used to imply a specific extent of distribution.
      For example, between the LI resonator of FIG. 5 and the fully DI
      resonators of FIGS. 7, 9, 11 and 13 there exists a continuum of
      partially DI resonators. Thus, the present invention's scope is
      not limited to a specific degree of distributed impedance.
      Conversely, the scope of the invention includes the employment of
      the specific distributed impedance required by a given application
      or desired waveform.<br>
      <br>
      The resonators shown in FIGS. 7, 9, 11 and 13 provide embodiments
      of the present invention which avoid abrupt area changes in order
      to provide high amplitude harmonics. When compared at the same
      fundamental amplitude, the present invention's resonators can
      provide higher amplitude harmonics than the more abrupt area
      change resonators shown in FIGS. 5 and 6.<br>
      <br>
      Due to their comparatively low relative amplitude harmonics, the
      resonators of FIGS. 5 and 6 would need much higher fundamental
      amplitudes to generate the relative harmonic amplitudes needed to
      cause an appreciable change in the waveform. However, the
      excessive turbulence caused by abrupt area changes makes higher
      fundamental amplitudes extremely difficult and inefficient to
      achieve.<br>
      <br>
      For example, when the resonator of FIG. 6 has an average pressure
      P0 of 85 psia and a peak-to-peak pressure amplitude of 60 psi, all
      harmonic amplitudes are at least 25 dB below the fundamental,
      resulting in a nearly sinusoidal waveform. At peak-to-peak
      pressures of 60 psi and above, turbulence begins to dominate the
      performance, as evidenced by high-amplitude high-frequency noise
      riding on the fundamental, and by excessive power consumption.<br>
      <br>
      In order to avoid turbulence at the design conditions the
      preferred embodiment of the present invention includes resonators
      having a radius r and an axial coordinate z, where dr/dz is
      continuous wherever particle velocities are high enough so as to
      otherwise cause turbulence due to the discontinuity. The preferred
      embodiment also avoids excessive values of d@2 r/dz@2 where
      particle velocities are high, in order to prevent turbulence which
      would otherwise occur as a result of excessive radial fluid
      accelerations.<br>

      <b>Harmonic phase within harmonic resonators</b><br>
      <br>
      In order to provide some helpful insight into the resonators of
      the present invention it is instructive to first examine the
      simpler case of harmonic resonators.<br>
      <br>
      Within harmonic resonators, harmonic phases have a strong but
      predictable frequency dependence when the drive frequency is in
      the vicinity of a mode frequency, as shown in the literature (see
      for example, W. Chester, Resonant oscillations in closed tubes, J.
      Fluid Mech. 18, 44-64 (1964)).<br>
      <br>
      These effects are considered for harmonics 1-5 as follows for the
      example of a harmonic resonator driven at frequencies very close
      to a mode frequency. FIG. 2 illustrates the case of a perfectly
      harmonic cylindrical resonator for three drive frequencies: f1
      below, f2 equal to and f3 above the resonance frequency of mode 1.
      The bottom horizontal axis indicates the resonance frequencies of
      the first five modes of the resonator (denoted by the vertical
      lines at 100, 200, 300, 400 and 500 Hz). The three horizontal
      lines with superposed symbols provide axes for the wave's
      fundamental and associated lower harmonics (denoted by the
      symbols) at drive frequencies f1, f2 and f3.<br>
      <br>
      The frequency-dependent harmonic phase relationships can be
      qualitatively demonstrated by the following:<br>
      where E(t) is the acoustic pressure(which adds to the ambient
      pressure P0), An is the amplitude of each harmonic n, f is the
      ##EQU1## fundamental (or drive) frequency of the acoustic wave and
      .phi.n is the frequency-dependent phase of each harmonic n.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 3 provides the resulting waveforms, as measured at either end
      of the cylindrical resonator, for the three drive frequencies f1,
      f2 and f3 of FIG. 2. All of the drive frequencies f are near the
      lowest resonance frequency of the resonator. For this example, the
      amplitudes of the fundamental and harmonics are given by An =1/n
      for each of the three waveforms (note that this ignores any
      frequency dependence that An may have). In FIG. 3, time is the
      horizontal axis and pressure is the vertical axis, where P0 is the
      ambient pressure of the medium.<br>
      <br>
      Referring to FIG. 2, drive frequency f1 is below the mode 1
      frequency, causing the frequency of harmonic n (nf1) to fall
      between the frequencies of modes n-1 and n. The resulting
      fundamental and harmonic phases are .phi.n =-90 DEG for each n.
      The pressure waveform is calculated using Equation 1 and is
      denoted by f1 in FIG. 3. This waveform is referred to as
      asymmetric negative (AN), since P- &gt; P+ .<br>
      <br>
      Drive frequency f2 in FIG. 2 is equal to the mode 1 frequency,
      causing the frequency of harmonic n to be equal to the frequency
      of mode n. The resulting fundamental and harmonic phases are
      .phi.n =0 DEG for each n. The pressure waveform is denoted by f2
      in FIG. 3, where the wave is shocked and P+ = P- .<br>
      <br>
      Drive frequency f3 in FIG. 2 is greater than the mode 1 frequency
      but less than the mode 2 frequency, causing the frequency of
      harmonic n to fall between the frequencies of modes n and n+1. The
      resulting fundamental and harmonic phases are .phi.n =90 DEG for
      each n. The pressure waveform is denoted by f3 in FIG. 3, and is
      referred to as asymmetric positive (AP), since P+ &gt; P- .<br>
      <br>
      The relative phases of the first three harmonics (with frequencies
      f, 2f and 3f) for each waveform shown in FIG. 3 are demonstrated
      in FIGS. 4A-4C. Note that the amplitude of each harmonic has been
      normalized. For different phase angles .phi.n the relative
      positions in time of each harmonic component of a wave change.<br>
      <br>
      When the harmonic resonator's drive frequency is swept up through
      the lowest resonance frequency the phases .phi.n sweep from -90
      DEG through 0 DEG (at resonance) to +90 DEG taking a continuum of
      values within the range. Note that as the drive frequency f is
      swept through the resonance frequency of mode n=1, each harmonic
      frequency nf will be swept through the resonance frequency of the
      nth mode. Phases .phi.n between -90 DEG and 0 DEG will produce AN
      waves, and phases .phi.n between 0 DEG and +90 DEG will produce AP
      waves. When .phi.n =.±.90 DEG the waveforms will be symmetric in
      time like f1 and f3 of FIG. 3, and when -90 DEG&lt;.phi.n &lt;+90
      DEG, the waveforms will be asymmetric in time. As the .phi.n
      approach 0 from a value of .±.90 DEG, the waveforms become
      progressively more time asymmetric as they evolve towards a
      sawtooth waveform (i.e., a shockwave). For simplicity, nonlinear
      effects which cause the resonance frequencies to change (such as
      hardening or softening nonlinearities) are not considered in the
      previous example. Another effect that has been ignored is that, as
      the phases .phi.n approach 0 DEG, the relative amplitudes of the
      harmonics will increase.<br>
      <br>
      The above example of the behavior of a harmonic resonator gives
      some insight into how pressure waveforms can be altered by
      changing the phases of the harmonics. The present invention
      exploits the phenomenon of variable harmonic phase in anharmonic
      resonators driven on resonance by altering the resonator's
      boundary conditions.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Phase determination in anharmonic resonators</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      In creating the resonator boundary conditions needed to control
      both harmonic phase and amplitude, the present invention provides
      a means to synthesize a desired waveform over a wide range of
      acoustic pressure amplitudes. This new capability is referred to
      as Resonant Macrosonic Synthesis (RMS).<br>
      <br>
      The so-called pressure amplitude "shock-limit" is commonly
      associated with high relative amplitudes of the harmonics. RMS
      demonstrates that shock formation is more precisely a function of
      harmonic phase. The present invention exploits the ability to
      alter the phase of the harmonics, thereby dramatically extending
      the shock-limit to permit heretofore unachievable pressure
      amplitudes.<br>
      <br>
      Some insight into the significance of phase variations can be
      gained in reference to FIGS. 3 and 4A-4C. The fundamental and
      harmonic amplitudes (An of Equation 1) of f2 and f3 are the same.
      By changing only the harmonic phase, f2 experiences a 30% increase
      in peak-to-peak pressure amplitude. In practice, the gain in the
      maximum possible pressure amplitude will be much greater. When the
      phases of the harmonics are changed from 0 DEG to +90 DEG, the
      classic shock is removed and the power once dissipated due to the
      shock front can contribute to much higher pressure amplitudes.<br>
      <br>
      As shown in FIGS. 2, 3 and 4A-4C, the frequency dependence of the
      phases of the harmonics seen in harmonic resonators is
      predictable, and uniformly imparts a phase shift of like sign to
      the lower harmonics of the fundamental. This phase shift (and the
      resulting waveform change) occurs as the resonator is swept
      through resonance. The anharmonic resonators of the present
      invention are designed to give a desired waveform (determined by
      the harmonic amplitudes and phases) while running at a resonance
      frequency. Even though the mode-harmonic proximities of anharmonic
      resonators are fixed (while the drive frequency is kept equal to a
      resonance frequency), phase and amplitude effects similar to those
      of harmonic resonators still exist. These effects are exploited in
      the design of the boundary conditions (determined by the geometry
      of the walls and by the acoustical properties of the wall material
      and fluid in the resonator) of the present invention, whereby
      different phases and relative amplitudes can be imparted to
      individual harmonics as required for a desired waveform.<br>
      <br>
      In the following embodiments, only the fundamental (of frequency
      f, where f is the drive frequency) and harmonics 2 (of frequency
      2f) and 3 (of frequency 3f) are considered. The greater a
      harmonic's relative amplitude the greater its potential effect on
      the net waveform. The nonlinear processes through which energy is
      transferred to higher harmonics tend to result in harmonics that
      diminish in amplitude as the number of the harmonic rises. Thus, a
      fairly accurate representation of the final waveform can be
      achieved by considering the fundamental and harmonics 2 and 3. In
      practice, the same analytical methods used to determine the
      amplitude and phase of harmonics 2 and 3 can be extended to
      harmonics 4 and higher, in order to determine their impact on the
      net waveform.<br>
      <br>
      Specific mechanical means for providing the driving power to the
      following embodiments of the present invention are described in
      U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,319,938 and 5,231,337 the entire contents of
      which are hereby incorporated by reference. The driving method
      used in FIGS. 5, 6, 7, 9, 11 and 13 assumes a resonator having
      reflective terminations at each end, which is oscillated (driven)
      along its cylindrical axis at the frequency of a mode.
      Alternatively, a resonator can be driven by replacing one of the
      reflective terminations with a vibrating piston. Drive power can
      also be thermally delivered, as in the case of a thermoacoustic
      prime mover (as in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,953,366 and 4,858,441) or by
      exploiting a fluid's periodic absorption of electromagnetic energy
      as in U.S. Pat. No. 5,020,977. Detail driving methods are omitted
      in the following discussions and drawings for simplicity, although
      FIGS. 15A, 15B and 16 show block diagrams of a driver connected to
      drive a resonator which is also connected to a flow impedance.<br>
      <br>
      For an anharmonic resonator it is difficult to predict a
      harmonic's phase merely by its proximity to a given resonant mode.
      However, the harmonic phases and other properties of the resonator
      can be predicted with existing analytical methods. Such properties
      can include the particle velocity, resonant mode frequencies,
      power consumption, resonance quality factor, harmonic phases and
      amplitudes and resulting waveforms. Determination of the acoustic
      field inside a resonator depends on the solution of a differential
      equation that describes the behavior of a fluid when high
      amplitude sound waves are present. One nonlinear equation that may
      be used is the NTT wave equation (J. Naze Tj.phi.tta and S.
      Tj.phi.tta, "Interaction of sound waves. Part I: Basic equations
      and plane waves," J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 82, 1425-1428 (1987)), which
      is given by ##EQU2## where the coefficient of nonlinearity is
      defined by .beta.=1+B/2A. The Lagrangian density L is defined by:
      ##EQU3## The variable p is the acoustic pressure; u is the
      acoustic particle velocity; t is time; x, y, and z are space
      variables; c0 is the small signal sound speed; .rho.0 is the
      ambient density of the fluid; B/2A is the parameter of
      nonlinearity (R. T. Beyer, "Parameter of nonlinearity in fluids,"
      J. Acoust Soc. Am. 32, 719-721 (1960)); and .delta. is referred to
      as the sound diffusivity, which accounts for the effects of
      viscosity and heat conduction on a wave propagating in free space
      (M. J. Lighthill, Surveys in Mechanics, edited by G. K. Batchelor
      and R. M. Davies (Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, England,
      1956), pp. 250-351).<br>
      <br>
      For the embodiments of the present invention described in FIGS. 8,
      10, 12 and 14 the theoretical values are predicted by solutions of
      Equation 2. The solutions are based on a lossless (.delta.=0)
      version of Equation 2 restricted to one spatial dimension (z).
      Losses are included on an ad hoc basis by calculating
      thermoviscous boundary layer losses (G. W. Swift, "Thermoacoustic
      engines," J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 84, 1145-1180 (1988)).<br>
      <br>
      The method used to solve Equation 2 is a finite element analysis.
      For each finite element the method of successive approximations
      (to third order) is applied to the nonlinear wave equation
      described by Equation 2 to derive linear differential equations
      which describe the acoustic fields at the fundamental, second
      harmonic and third harmonic frequencies. The coefficient of
      nonlinearity .beta. is determined by experiment for any given
      fluid. The analysis is carried out on a computer having a central
      processing unit and program and data memory (ROM and RAM
      respectively). The computer is programmed to solve Equation 2
      using the finite element analysis described above. The computer is
      provided with a display in the form of a monitor and/or printer to
      permit output of the calculations and display of the waveform
      shapes for each harmonic.<br>
      <br>
      The comparisons of theory and experiment shown for the embodiments
      of the present invention in FIGS. 8, 10, 12 and 14 reveal good
      agreement between predicted and measured data. More accurate
      mathematical models may be developed by solving Equation 2 for 2
      or 3 spatial dimensions. Also, a more exact wave equation can be
      used (Equation 2 is exact to quadratic order in the acoustic
      pressure).<br>
      <br>
      For the embodiments of the present invention described in the
      remainder of this section the solutions of Equation 2 are used to
      provide predictions of harmonic phase and amplitude. The simple
      concepts developed for illustration in the previous section for
      harmonic resonators (i.e., the relative position of modes and
      harmonics in the frequency domain) are considered as well and are
      shown not to be uniformly valid.<br>
      <br>
      First, a simple embodiment of the present invention which will
      provide AP waves is considered. Referring to FIGS. 2 and 3, the
      phases which provided AP wave f3 were obtained by placing the
      frequencies of the lower harmonics (nf) between the frequencies of
      modes n and n+1. Similar mode-harmonic proximities can exist in
      anharmonic resonators which provide AP waves.<br>
      <br>
      Anharmonic DI resonator 22 of FIG. 7 provides an on-resonance AP
      wave. Resonator 22 is formed by a conical chamber 24 which has a
      throat flange 26 and a mouth flange 28. The two open ends of
      conical chamber 24 are rigidly terminated by a throat plate 30 and
      a mouth plate 32, fastened respectively to throat flange 26 and
      mouth flange 28. The axial length of chamber 24 alone is 17.14 cm
      and the respective chamber inner diameters at the throat (smaller
      end) and mouth (larger end) are 0.97 cm and 10.15 cm.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 8 shows the calculated design phases and pressure
      distributions along the axial length L of resonator 22 for the
      fundamental and 2nd and 3rd harmonics, e.g., graphs (a), (b) and
      (c) respectively. Also shown is the net pressure waveform, graph
      (d), obtained by the summation in time (using Equation 1) ) of the
      fundamental, 2nd and 3nd harmonics with the proper phases .phi.n
      and amplitudes An at the throat end (z=0) of resonator 22 using
      Equation 2. For comparison is the waveform, graph (e), constructed
      from the amplitudes and phases of the fundamental and 2nd and 3rd
      harmonics measured when the resonator was charged with HFC-134a to
      a pressure of 85 psia. As in the case of an AP wave in a harmonic
      resonator the frequencies of the lower harmonics (nf) are between
      the frequencies of modes n and n+1.<br>
      <br>
      When a 7/4 scaled-up version of resonator 22 was pressurized to 85
      psia with HFC-134a, waveforms were generated with acoustic
      particle velocities above MACH 1 and associated peak-to-peak
      pressure oscillations above 400 psi.<br>
      <br>
      DI resonators, like resonator 22 of FIG. 7, can provide AP waves
      which are useful in Rankine-cycle applications, as discussed
      above. Other applications may require different wave properties.
      For example, a given application may require keeping P+ constant
      and increasing P- by 25% while reducing power consumption.<br>
      <br>
      Anharmonic resonator 34 of FIGS. 9 and 10 provides one of the many
      possible approaches to meet the design requirements of increased
      P- and reduced power consumption. Using resonator 22 as a starting
      point, we can see from the (+90 DEG ) curves in FIG. 4 that
      reducing the 2nd harmonic amplitude will increase P- if phase
      remains unchanged. Alternatively, increasing the 3nd harmonic
      amplitude will increase P- . As shown in FIG. 8, conical resonator
      22 allows very high relative amplitude harmonics to exist. In
      order to alter the harmonic amplitudes, a change in the boundary
      conditions of conical resonator 22 is required, such as making d@2
      r/dz@2 non-zero at some point. Resonator 34 of FIG. 9 provides an
      appropriate boundary condition change and is formed by a chamber
      36 having a curved section 38, a conical section 40, a throat
      flange 42 and a mouth flange 44. Resonator 34 is rigidly
      terminated by a throat plate 46 and a mouth plate 48. The axial
      length of chamber 36 alone is 17.14 cm and the mouth inner
      diameter is 10.15 cm. Curved section 38 is 4.28 cm long, and its
      diameter as a function of axial coordinate z is given by: ##EQU4##
      where z is in meters, m=33.4 and Dth =0.097 m.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 10 shows the calculated design data for resonator 34, (graphs
      (a)-(d)) including the waveform constructed from measured data
      (graph (e)) for a 85 psia charge of HFC-134a. The relative
      amplitude of the 2nd harmonic has been reduced from 0.388 for
      resonator 22 (29.2 psi for the second harmonic divided by 75.3 psi
      for the fundamental), to 0.214 psi for resonator 34 (18.88 psi
      divided by 88.02 psi). This reduction in 2nd harmonic leads to a
      25% increase in P- . Power consumption has also been reduced.<br>
      <br>
      Another simple embodiment of the present invention is anharmonic
      DI resonator 50, which is designed to provide AN waves. Resonator
      50 is formed by a curved chamber 52, having a throat flange 54 and
      a mouth flange 56. The two open ends of curved chamber 52 are
      rigidly terminated by a throat plate 58 and a mouth plate 60,
      fastened respectively to throat flange 54 and mouth flange 56. The
      axial length of chamber 52 alone is 24.24 cm and the mouth inner
      diameter is 9.12 cm. The inner diameter of chamber 52, as a
      function of axial coordinate z, is given by:<br>
      D(z)=0.0137+0.03z+20z@4<br>
      <br>
      where z is in meters, and z=0 is at the throat (amaller) end of
      the chamber. FIG. 12 shows the calculated design data for
      resonator 50. The calculated time waveform shows the desired AN
      symmetry, which results from the -90 DEG phase of the 2nd
      harmonic. Referring to FIGS. 2, 3 and 4A-4C, the phases which
      produced AN wave f1 for a harmonic resonator were obtained by
      placing frequencies nf of the harmonics between the frequencies of
      modes n-1 and n. Anharmonic DI resonator 50 of FIGS. 11 and 12,
      which produces AN waves, also has harmonic frequencies nf between
      the frequencies of modes n-1 and n for n=2 and 3.<br>
      <br>
      In the anharmonic resonators 22 and 50 of FIGS. 7 and 11
      respectively, AP and AN waves were provided. In both cases, the
      simple concepts illustrated for harmonic resonators which relate
      harmonic phase to the relative position in the frequency domain of
      harmonics and modes were also valid for the anharmonic resonators.
      While these simple cases help to provide some insight, the simple
      concepts illustrated for harmonic resonators are not always valid
      for anharmonic resonators and are not sufficiently sophisticated
      to realize the present invention's potential. Rigorous
      mathematical models such as the one based on Equation 2 are best
      suited to the design of the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      For example, a resonator's modes need not be shifted up in
      frequency, as in resonator 50, in order to provide AN waves. FIGS.
      13 and 14 show a resonator 62 whose modes are shifted down in
      frequency, similar to resonator 22. Unlike resonator 22, which
      produces AP waves, resonator 62 provides AN waves.<br>
      <br>
      Resonator 62 is formed by a curved chamber 64, having a throat
      flange 66 and a mouth flange 68. The two open ends of curved
      chamber 64 are rigidly terminated by a throat plate 70 and a mouth
      plate 72, fastened respectively to throat flange 66 and mouth
      flange 68. The axial length of chamber 64 alone is 24.24 cm. The
      inner diameter of chamber 64, as a function of axial coordinate z,
      is given by: ##EQU5## where z is in meters and the coordinate
      origin is at the throat open end of the resonator 62.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 14 shows the calculated design data for resonator 62,
      including the waveform constructed from data measured when
      resonator 62 was charged with HFC-134a to a pressure of 85 psia.
      The desired AN wave symmetry, which results from the -90 DEG 2nd
      harmonic phase is present for the theoretical and measured
      waveforms.<br>
      <br>
      The resonators of the present invention are ideal for use in
      acoustic compressors. Acoustic compressors and their various valve
      arrangements are discussed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,020,977, 5,167,124
      and 5,319,938, the entire contents of which are hereby
      incorporated by reference. In general, acoustic compressors can be
      used for many applications. Some examples include the compression
      or pumping of fluids or high purity fluids, heat transfer cycles,
      gas transport and processing and energy conversion.<br>
      <br>
      FIGS. 15A and 15B illustrate an acoustic compressor in a closed
      cycle, which uses a resonator of the present invention. In FIG.
      15A, resonator 74 has a throat flange 76 and a mouth flange 78.
      Resonator 74 is rigidly terminated by a mouth plate 80 fastened to
      mouth flange 78. A valve head 82 is attached to throat flange 76
      and has a discharge valve 84 and a suction valve 86, which are
      respectively connected to flow impedance 88 by conduits 90 and 92.
      Discharge valve 84 and suction valve 86 serve to convert the
      oscillating pressure within resonator 74 into a net fluid flow
      through flow impedance 88. Flow impedance 88 could include a heat
      exchange system or an energy conversion device. The resonator 74
      may be preferably driven by a driver 94, such as an
      electromagnetic shaker well known in the art, which mechanically
      oscillates the entire resonator 74 in a manner described in either
      of U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,319,938 and 5,231,337 incorporated herein by
      reference. Resilient mountings 96 are provided to secure the
      resonator 74 and driver 94 to a fixed member 98 which secures the
      resonator/driver assembly.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 15B is similar to FIG. 15A wherein the mouth plate 80 of the
      resonator 74 is replaced by a piston 80' in which case driver 94'
      takes the form of an electromagnetic driver such as a voice coil
      driver for oscillating the piston. This arrangement is well known
      to those of skill in the art.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 16 illustrates the use of the resonator 74 as a compressor,
      in a compression-evaporation refrigeration system. In FIG. 16, the
      resonator is connected in a closed loop, consisting of a condenser
      124, capillary tube 126, and evaporator 130. This arrangement
      constitutes a typical compression-evaporation system, which can be
      used for refrigeration, air-conditioning, heat pumps or other heat
      transfer applications. In this case, the fluid comprises a
      compression-evaporation refrigerant. The driver 94" may be either
      an entire resonator driver per FIG. 15A or a piston type driver
      per FIG. 15B.<br>
      <br>
      In operation, a pressurized liquid refrigerant flows into
      evaporator 130 from capillary tube 126 (serving as a pressure
      reduction device), therein experiencing a drop in pressure. This
      low pressure liquid refrigerant inside evaporator 130 then absorbs
      its heat of vaporization from the refrigerated space 128, thereby
      becoming a low pressure vapor. The standing wave compressor
      maintains a low suction pressure, whereby the low pressure
      vaporous refrigerant is drawn out of evaporator 130 and into the
      standing wave resonator 74. This low pressure vaporous refrigerant
      is then acoustically compressed within resonator 74, and
      subsequently discharged into condenser 124 at a higher pressure
      and temperature. As the high pressure gaseous refrigerant passes
      through condenser 124, it gives up heat and condenses into a
      pressurized liquid once again,. This pressurize liquid refrigerant
      then flows through capillary tube 126, and the thermodynamic cycle
      repeats.<br>
      <br>
      The advantages of resonators having changing cross-sectional area,
      such as reduced particle velocity, viscous energy dissipation and
      thermal energy dissipation, are explained in U.S. Pat. No.
      5,319,938, which is hereby incorporated by reference for these
      features.<br>
      <br>
      It is noted that in the preferred embodiments of the resonator
      chamber illustrated in FIGS. 7, 9, 11, 13 and 15, the chamber has
      an interior region which is structurally empty and contains only
      the fluid (e.g., refrigerant). Production of the desired waveform
      is achieved by changing the internal cross sectional area of the
      chamber along the longitudinal, z, axis so as to achieve the
      desired harmonic phases and amplitudes without producing undue
      turbulence.<br>
      <br>
      While the above description contains many dimensional
      specifications, these should not be construed as limitations on
      the scope of the invention, but rather as exemplifications of
      preferred embodiments thereof. The preferred embodiments focus on
      the resonant synthesis of a desired waveform within resonators of
      very simple geometry. Thus, the scope of the present invention is
      not limited to a specific resonator design, but rather to the
      exploitation of a resonator's boundary conditions to control
      harmonic amplitude and phase, thereby providing Resonant
      Macrosonic Synthesis.<br>
      <br>
      The number of specific embodiments of the present invention is as
      varied as the number of desired properties. Such properties could
      include energy consumption, the ratio of throat-to-mouth pressure
      amplitudes, resonance quality factor, desired pressure amplitudes,
      exact waveform and the operating fluid. There is a continuum of
      resonator geometries having the boundary conditions needed to
      provide a given property. A resonator's boundary conditions can be
      altered by changing the wall geometry, which includes flat or
      curved mouth plates and throat plates. Variation of plate
      curvature can be used to alter mode frequencies, acoustic particle
      velocity, resonance quality factor and energy consumption. The
      exact geometry chosen for a given design will reflect the order of
      importance of the desired properties. In general, a resonator's
      geometry could be cylindrical, spherical, toroidal, conical,
      horn-shaped or combinations of the above.<br>
      <br>
      An important characteristic of the invention is the ability to
      achieve steady state waveforms which are synthesized as a result
      of selection of the chamber boundary conditions, i.e., the
      waveforms persist over time as the compressor is being operated.
      Thus, in one preferred application to relatively low pressure
      compressors, the steady state operation of the compressor would
      supply steady state peak to peak pressure amplitudes as a
      percentage of mean pressure in the ranges of 0.5-25%, or more
      selectively between one of: 0.5-1.0%; 1.0-5.0%; 5.0-10.%; 10-15%;
      15-20%; 20-25%; 10-25%; 15-25% and 20-25%. In relatively moderate
      pressure applications, the percentages may range from 25-100% and
      more selectively between one of: 30-100%; 40-100%; 50-100%;
      60-100%; 70-100%; 80-100% and 90-100%. In relatively high pressure
      applications these percentages may include values greater than
      100% and more selectively values greater than any one of: 125%;
      150%; 175%; 200%; 300% and 500%.<br>
      <br>
      There are many ways to exploit the basic features of the present
      invention which will readily occur to one skilled in the art. For
      example, the waveforms provided by the present invention are not
      limited to those discussed herein. The present invention can
      provide different phases and relative amplitudes for each harmonic
      by varying the boundary conditions of the resonator, thereby
      providing a wide variety of means to control the resulting
      waveform. Also, the phase effects imparted to a harmonic by a
      resonant mode are not restricted to only longitudinal modes.<br>
      <br>
      Furthermore, non-sinusoidal waves do not have to be pressure
      asymmetric. Shock-free waves can be non-sinusoidal and pressure
      symmetric by providing low even-harmonic amplitudes and high
      odd-harmonic amplitudes with non-zero phases. Thus, the present
      invention can provide a continuum of pressure asymmetry.<br>
      <br>
      Still further, the resonators of the present invention can be
      scaled up or down in size and still provide similar waveforms,
      even though operating frequencies and power consumption can
      change. Accordingly, the scope of the invention should be
      determined not by the embodiments illustrated, but by the appended
      claims and their equivalents.<br>

      <br>
      A vibrational acoustic unit comprises a dynamic force motor, a
      power take-off spring having one end attached to the dynamic force
      motor and the other end attached to a fluid filled acoustic
      resonator. The motor oscillates the entire acoustic resonator so
      as to excite a resonant mode of the acoustic resonator. A method
      of delivering power to an acoustic resonator comprises resiliently
      connecting a motor to the resonator, and driving the motor to
      oscillate the entire acoustic resonator so as to excite a resonant
      mode of the acoustic resonator.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>1. Field of Invention</b><br>
      <br>
      This invention relates to power delivery systems for the
      transduction of mechanical power into acoustic power through the
      oscillation of an entire resonator to excite a resonant mode,
      having applications to any acoustic resonator shape.<br>
      <br>
      <b>2. Description of Related Art</b><br>
      <br>
      There are a number of different ways to deliver power to a
      standing acoustic wave which are known in the field of acoustics.
      The method of entire resonator driving, as described in U.S. Pat.
      Nos. 5,319,938 and 5,515,684, depends on vibrating the entire
      resonator back and forth in order to use the resonator's inner
      surface area as the power delivery surface. This approach requires
      a motor that provides a dynamic force to create the resonator
      oscillation.<br>
      <br>
      As shown in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,319,938; 5,231,337; and 5,515,684,
      incorporated herein by reference, motors used for entire resonator
      driving typically comprise two moving motor components. FIG. 1
      illustrates a prior art device where motor component 4 is rigidly
      connected to the fluid-filled acoustic resonator 2, and motor
      component 6 is resiliently mounted to motor component 4 by a
      spring 8. When a dynamic force is generated between these two
      motor components, they move dynamically in reactive opposition to
      each other, thus causing the entire resonator to oscillate so that
      power is delivered to the fluid. The heavier motor component 6 may
      be resiliently connected to ground.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 2 shows a lumped element diagram of the prior art device of
      FIG. 1. The fluid within the resonator is modeled as spring 14 and
      mass 12. Associated with each spring is a damper. Since motor mass
      4a and resonator mass 2a are rigidly connected they comprise a
      single moving mass of the system.<br>
      <br>
      Power is delivered to the standing wave according to
      1/(2.omega.)FA sin .theta., where .omega.=2.pi.f with f being the
      drive frequency, F is the magnitude of the force exerted at the
      face 10 of motor mass 4a, A is the magnitude of the acceleration
      of motor mass 4a and the resonator mass 2a, and .theta. is the
      (temporal) phase angle between F and A. The motor must supply not
      only the force needed to deliver power to the acoustic load but
      also to directly oscillate motor mass 4a and resonator mass 2a
      back and forth. The force required to oscillate masses 2a and 4a
      is not delivered to the acoustic load. However, generating this
      mass-driving force results in energy losses due to the motor's
      transduction efficiency and thus reduces the overall efficiency of
      the power delivery system.<br>
      <br>
      A further source of inefficiency in the prior art system shown in
      FIGS. 1 and 2 is its limited control of the power factor sin
      .theta.. If .theta.=90 DEG then the power factor sin .theta.=1. If
      .theta. assumes values progressively less or greater than 90 DEG
      then the required motor force increases thus minimizing the energy
      efficiency of the power delivery system. Adjusting the resonator
      mass 2a and the motor mass 4a can help tune the power factor
      toward unity, but structural stiffness and pressure rating
      requirements for the resonator as well as design requirements for
      the motor will limit the degree of freedom to make such
      adjustments.<br>
      <br>
      It is well known in the art of vibrational motors that adjusting
      the stiffness of spring 8a of FIG.2 in order to tune the
      mechanical resonance close to the acoustic resonance will reduce
      the required motor force for a given power delivery. However, this
      can result in greatly amplified displacements between the moving
      components which generate excessive noise and higher spring
      stresses. A control is generally required to keep the drive
      frequency locked to the acoustic resonance since sound speed
      changes due to heating and other effects will cause the acoustic
      resonant frequency to drift during operation. If the mechanical
      resonance frequency is tuned close to the acoustic resonance, then
      severe control problems can occur due to resonance repulsion
      phenomena if the resonant frequency drift brings the two resonant
      peaks too close together.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      It is an object of the present invention to provide a power take
      off (PTO) spring between a dynamic force motor and a resonant
      acoustic load which for a given acoustic power delivery reduces
      the required motor force, reduces the motor size requirement,
      allows greater control of mechanical power factor, reduces motor
      energy dissipation losses due to lower required forces thus
      improving system efficiency, allows tuning of all the relative
      displacements and phases of all oscillating mass components, and
      allows greater design flexibility on overall motor topology. These
      and other objects and advantages of the invention will become
      apparent from the accompanying specifications and drawings,
      wherein like reference numerals refer to like parts throughout.<br>
      <br>
      The invention may be characterized as a vibrational acoustic unit

      attached to a fluid filled acoustic resonator, wherein the entire
      acoustic resonator is oscillated so as to excite a resonant mode
      of the acoustic resonator.<br>
      <br>
      The invention may also be characterized as a method of delivering
      power to an acoustic resonator comprising the steps of resiliently
      and exclusively connecting a motor to the resonator, and driving
      the motor to oscillate the entire acoustic resonator so as to
      excite a resonant mode of the acoustic resonator.<br>
      <br>
      The invention may further be characterized as a method of driving
      an acoustic resonator comprising the steps of connecting a motor
      to the resonator using a resilient connection, and driving the
      motor to oscillate the entire acoustic resonator so as to excite a
      resonant mode of the acoustic resonator, the motor exciting the
      resonant mode through the resilient connection.<br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b><br>
      <br>
      FIG. 3 illustrates an embodiment of the present invention where a
      power take off (PTO) spring 20 has been added to the prior art
      device of FIG. 1 between the moving motor mass 18 and resonator
      22. In operation, an dynamic force of frequency f is created
      between motor mass 14 and motor mass 18 which causes motor masses
      14 and 18 to oscillate at frequency f in reactive opposition to
      each other. The periodic displacement of motor mass 18 causes a
      dynamic force to be transmitted through spring 20 to resonator 22
      which in turn causes a periodic displacement of resonator 22 at
      frequency f. If frequency f is equal to a standing wave mode
      frequency of the resonator which can be excited by the resonator's
      motion, then the periodic displacement of resonator 22 will
      transfer energy to that mode.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 4 provides a lumped element diagram of the embodiment of FIG.
      3, comprising motor mass 14a, motor mass 18a, motor spring 16a,
      PTO spring 20a, resonator mass 22a, fluid spring 24 and fluid mass
      26. When a mode of resonator 22 is being driven, the phases
      between the displacements of all masses 14a, 18a, 22a, and 26 are
      determined by the respective mass values and by the respective
      stiffness and damping values of motor spring 16a, PTO spring 20a,
      and fluid spring 24.<br>
      <br>
      Adjusting the stiffness of PTO spring 20a of FIG. 4 provides a
      means to tune the mechanical power factor seen by the motor
      (represented by masses 14a and 18a) as it delivers power to the
      resonator, thus reducing the motor force required for a given
      power delivery to the load. PTO spring 20a also prevents rigid
      coupling of resonator mass 22a with motor mass 18a, thereby making
      possible designs which reduce the motor force required for a given
      power delivery to the load. Reducing the required motor force
      results in reducing energy losses resulting from the motor's
      transduction efficiency and thus improves the overall efficiency
      of the power delivery system. Reducing the required motor force
      also reduces the required size of the motor, thus reducing the
      amount of motor materials required for a given power delivery to
      the load.<br>
      <br>
      PTO spring 20a of FIG. 4 allows power factors approaching unity to
      be achieved without having to tune any of the mechanical
      resonances, associated with springs 16a and 20a, close the driven
      acoustic resonance. Thus, component displacements are minimized,
      noise is reduced, and excessive spring stresses are avoided.
      Providing high power factors, without the risk of crossing
      acoustical and mechanical resonance frequencies, eliminates the
      severe control problems which occur due to resonance repulsion
      phenomena.<br>
      <br>
      The stiffness of each mechanical spring can be chosen so that (i)
      the mechanical resonance frequency where motor spring 20a sees its
      maximum displacement is above the acoustic resonance frequency and
      (ii) the mechanical resonance frequency where spring 16a sees its
      maximum displacement is below the acoustic resonance frequency.
      This design provides two preferred operating characteristics.
      First, fluid heating may cause the acoustic resonance frequency to
      increase during operation and this design assures that the
      acoustic resonance frequency will not cross the mechanical
      resonance frequency associated with the maximum displacement of
      spring 16a. Second, provided that the mechanical resonance
      frequency associated with the maximum displacement of spring 20a
      is sufficiently above the acoustic resonance frequency so that the
      two resonances never overlap during operation, then some benefit
      can be derived. As the acoustic resonance frequency increases,
      accelerations can also be made to increase thereby transferring
      more power to the load for the same motor force. Proper selection
      of component mass and spring stiffness can also cause the power
      factor measured at the air gap to improve as the acoustic
      resonance frequency increases.<br>
      <br>
      In general, the addition of PTO spring 20a allows greater system
      design flexibility, since the properties of each mechanical
      element are more independent. PTO spring 20a allows tuning of all
      the relative component displacements, relative displacement
      phases, and component masses.<br>
      <br>
      The power delivery unit should be resiliently mounted to ground,
      since each component of the system oscillates. For a given design,
      the specific acceleration of masses depends on the mass of each
      component and stiffness and damping of each spring. The mass with
      the lowest acceleration provides a good point for resilient
      mounting to ground.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 5 shows a cross sectional view of a variable reluctance motor
      used as a two-mass dynamic force motor in accordance with the
      present invention. The variable reluctance motor consists of a
      first motor mass 28 formed by a stack of flat "E" laminations
      rigidly joined together so that the stack forms a single unit, a
      second motor mass 30 formed by a stack of flat "I" laminations
      rigidly joined together so that the stack forms a single unit, a
      conducting coil 32 wound around the center leg of the E lamination
      stack, leaf springs 34, with levels 34a and 34b, which resiliently
      join the first and second motor masses 28 and 30 together via
      carriages 35 and 37, and a PTO leaf spring 36 which resiliently
      connects the second motor mass 30 to resonator 38. Second motor
      mass 30 is rigidly connected to carriage 35, and first motor mass
      28 is rigidly connected to carriage 37. Carriages 35 and 37 slide
      back and forth relative to one another. The motor laminations can
      be constructed of silicon steel laminations which are typically
      used in transformers. The mass of carriage 35 may be considered to
      be part of the second moving mass, and the mass of carriage 37 may
      be considered to be part of the first moving mass. The space
      between the three legs of the E laminations and the I laminations
      comprises an air gap 40. The two levels of leaf springs 34, levels
      34a and 34b, allow planer relative motion of second motor mass 30
      and first motor mass 28 so as to keep the instantaneous air gap 40
      everywhere uniform. Single level springs or any other spring
      topology could also be used which provide planer motion of the
      components.<br>
      <br>
      In operation, when an alternating current is established in coil
      32 a time varying magnetic flux is created within air gap 40 which
      is accompanied by a static attractive force and a time varying
      attractive force between the first and second motor masses 28 and
      30. Motor masses 28 and 30 respond to this time varying force by
      oscillating in reactive opposition to each other. Leaf springs 34
      provide a bias force to prevent the attractive force from drawing
      motor masses 28 and 30 together while still allowing them to
      oscillate. The periodic oscillation of motor mass 30 applies a
      dynamic force through PTO spring 36 to resonator 38, thus causing
      resonator 38 to oscillate along its cylindrical axis. If the
      oscillation frequency of resonator 38 is equal to one of the
      standing wave mode frequencies which can be excited by the
      resonator's motion, then the periodic displacement of resonator 22
      will transfer energy into that mode. Variable reluctance motors
      provide high energy efficiency when small displacements and large
      forces are required, which is typically the case for acoustic
      resonators.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 6 shows a variable reluctance motor used as a two-mass
      dynamic force motor in accordance with the present invention,
      which reduces the portion of total magnetic losses caused by
      non-grain oriented magnetic flux. The variable reluctance motor
      consists of a first motor mass 40 formed by tape-wound laminations
      and joined to each other so as to form a single unit, a second
      motor mass 42 formed by tape-wound laminations and joined to each
      other so as to form a single unit, a conducting coil 44 wound
      around the center leg of the first motor mass, leaf springs 46
      which resiliently join the first and second motor masses 40 and 42
      together via carriages 47 and 49, and a PTO leaf spring 48 which
      resiliently connects the second motor mass 42 to resonator 50. The
      mass of carriage 47 may be considered to be part of the second
      moving mass, and the mass of carriage 49 may be considered to be
      part of the first moving mass. In operation the motor of FIG. 6
      operates in the same manner as the motor of FIG. 5.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 7 illustrates an alternative magnetic structure for a
      variable-reluctance motor having first motor mass 52 formed of two
      tape-wound laminations and a second motor mass 54 formed of a
      single tape-wound lamination. While second motor mass 54 does not
      prevent cross-grain field orientation, it does provide a simple
      and very rigid structure having ends 56 and 58 which provide
      convenient connection points for springs, carriages or other
      hardware. Many combinations of tape-wound and stacked flat
      lamination components can be combined based on given design
      requirements and will suggest themselves to those skilled in the
      art.<br>
      <br>
      The PTO spring of the present invention can be used in combination
      with any type of dynamic force motor. All motors may be thought of
      as providing a dynamic force to a member causing some movement in
      that member, however small. Thus, all the motors, including all
      motors described herein are dynamic force motors.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 8 describes another type of dynamic force motor. FIG. 8
      illustrates an embodiment of the present invention having a PTO
      spring 64 with one end connected to a flexing dynamic force motor
      60 and the other end connected to a resonator 66. Reaction mass 62
      is preferably rigidly connected to flexing dynamic motor 60 at an
      end 61 thereof. Reaction mass 62 may be also be resiliently
      connected to flexing dynamic motor 60 at end 61, and in this case
      it is preferred that the resilient connection be relatively stiff
      compared to the spring constant or stiffness of PTO spring 64.
      Flexing dynamic motor 60 can be a piezoelectric element, a
      magnetostrictive element, or any other element which provides a
      dynamic force by periodically flexing or changing its overall
      dimensions.<br>
      <br>
      In operation motor 60 of FIG. 8 undergoes a periodic change in its
      dimension thus creating a dynamic force of frequency f which is
      communicated to resonator 66 through PTO spring 64. In embodiments
      in which the dynamic force motor 60 has a small mass relative to
      that of the reaction mass 62, the force of the motor 60 is
      effectively transferred to the resonator 66 by virtue of the
      reaction mass 62 and PTO spring 64 which causes the periodic
      displacement of resonator 66 at frequency f. Reaction mass 62
      prevents excessive accelerations of the reaction mass end 61 of
      motor 60 and maximizes the force of motor 60 applied to PTO spring
      64. If the frequency f is equal to a standing wave mode frequency
      of the resonator which can be excited by the resonator's motion,
      then the periodic displacement of resonator 66 will transfer
      energy into that mode. The embodiment of FIG. 8 can be operated
      without PTO spring 64 by rigidly connecting motor 60 to resonator
      66. However, this would eliminate the advantages described above.<br>
      <br>
      It may be seen that the embodiments of the invention utilize the
      PTO spring as the exclusive mechanism to couple the active force
      components of the motor to the resonator. Thus, the moving
      elements of the motor which are effective in causing oscillation
      of the resonator are isolated from the resonator by the resilient
      coupling mechanism, i.e., the PTO spring. In contrast, prior art
      devices couple the motor to the resonator by a rigid connection
      and do not utilize a PTO spring as the primary force path from the
      motor to the resonator.<br>
      <br>
      While the above description contains many embodiments of the
      invention, these should not be construed as limitations on the
      scope of the invention, but rather as an exemplification of
      preferred embodiments thereof. Other embodiments which will occur
      to those skilled in the art are within the scope of the present
      invention. For example, any motor which generates a dynamic force
      can be employed such as off-concentric rotational motors,
      electrodynamic motors, and electromagnetic motors. Variable
      reluctance motors need not use only laminations but can be formed
      from pressed materials that have multidirectional grain properties
      so as to avoid off-axis grain magnetic losses. The springs may
      comprise any spring type which accommodates a particular design
      such as coil springs, leaf springs, bellville springs, magnetic
      springs, gas springs or other devices that provide a resilient
      coupling. The fluids within the resonators of the present
      invention can be either liquids or gases. Any type of acoustic
      resonator can be used including cylindrical resonators or Resonant
      Macrosonic Synthesis (RMS) resonators of any shape as described
      for example in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,515,684, 5,319,938, and 5,174,130
      the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
      <br>
      It should further be appreciated that an excited resonance mode of
      the resonator may generally take place anywhere on the resonance
      response curve as, for example, at full or near full power, at
      half power points, quarter power points or the like. Thus a
      resonant mode can be excited over a range of frequencies.<br>
      <br>
      The scope of the present invention is not limited to particular
      applications of the acoustic resonator to which power is
      delivered. For example the present invention can be applied to
      acoustic resonators for oil-less acoustic compressors and pumps
      for air compression, refrigeration, comfort air-conditioning,
      hazardous fluids, ultra-pure fluids, natural gas, and commercial
      gases; acoustic resonators for process control; acoustic
      resonators used as process reactors for chemical and
      pharmaceutical industries; acoustic resonators for separation of
      gases including pressure swing adsorption; and acoustic resonators
      for agglomeration, levitation, mixing, and pulverization to name a
      few. Such applications may or may not include RMS resonators.
      While omitted for clarity, such applications of the invention may
      utilize inlet/outlet valves and heat exchange apparatus as shown
      in FIG. 13 of U.S. Pat. No. 5,319,938 and FIG. 16 of U.S. Pat. No.
      5,515,684.<br>

      by the embodiments illustrated, but by the appended claims and

      <br>
      An energy conversion device comprises an acoustic resonator, a
      pulse combustion device for creating a standing wave within said
      resonator, and an electric alternator. The alternate is coupled to
      the resonator to convert acoustically driven mechanical vibrations
      into electrical power.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>1) Field of Invention</b><br>
      <br>
      This invention relates to Resonant Macrosonic Synthesis (RMS)
      resonators which are either pulse combustion driven or
      thermoacoustically driven for the purpose of energy conversion,
      having specific applications to electric power production.<br>
      <br>
      <b>2) Description of Related Art</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      History reveals a rich variety of technologies conceived for the
      purpose of electric power production. Of particular interest are
      those technologies designed to combust liquid or gaseous fuels in
      order to produce electric power.<br>
      <br>
      Many types of internal combustion engines have been employed which
      convert the chemical potential energy of fuels into mechanical
      energy which is used to drive an electric alternator. However,
      internal combustion engines need frequent periodic maintenance and
      provide low conversion efficiencies. Currently, turbines provide
      the most efficient conversion of fuels, such as natural gas, into
      electric power. The design and manufacturing sophistication which
      is inherent in turbine technology can be seen in both their
      initial cost and operating cost.<br>
      <br>
      Some effort has been directed to the field of standing acoustic
      waves as a means of electric power production. For example, it was
      suggested by Swift that the oscillating pressure of
      thermoacoustically driven standing waves could be utilized for
      driving an alternator to produce electric power (G. W. Swift,
      "Thermoacoustic Engines," J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 84, 1166 (1988)).
      This would be accomplished by coupling a piston to an open end of
      the acoustic resonator and allowing the vibrating piston to drive
      a linear alternator The piston would require a gas seal such as a
      diaphragm or bellows which raises issues of reliability. Moving
      pistons also limit the dynamic force which can be extracted from
      the standing wave, thereby limiting the thermoacoustic generator's
      efficiency.<br>
      <br>
      Another application of standing acoustic waves to the production
      of electric power was reported by Swift which exploited Magneto
      Hydrodynamic effects in a thermoacoustically driven liquid sodium
      standing wave engine (G. W. Swift, "Thermoacoustic Engines," J.
      Acoust. Soc. Am. 84, 1169 (1988)).<br>
      <br>
      Pulse combustion (PC) is a further field of research where
      electric power production has been proposed in connection with
      standing acoustic waves. Other than Magneto Hydrodynamics the PC
      field has apparently received little attention as a means of
      producing electric power. Considerable research and development
      has occurred in the PC field dating back to the previous century.
      In the early 1920s pulse combustors first received attention as a
      means to drive electric power producing turbines as seen in U.S.
      Pat. No. 1,329,559 to Nikola Tesla. Most of the applications
      research performed today relates to producing either heat or
      propulsive thrust. For these applications, pulse combustors have
      always been comparatively attractive, due to their self-sustaining
      combustion cycle, inherent simplicity, and low production of
      pollutants. Putnam, Belles, and Kentfield provide a comprehensive
      history of pulse combustor development showing many of the
      embodiments and applications in the art of pulse combustion (A. A.
      Putnam, F. E. Belles, and J. A. C. Kentfield, "Pulse Combustion,"
      Prog. Energy Combust. Sci. 12, 43-79 (1986)). The field of PC
      research is very active with significant efforts taking place at
      institutions such as the Gas Research Institute, Sandia Combustion
      Labs, and various universities.<br>
      <br>
      In summary, thermoacoustic engines have been proposed as a means
      of driving piston-actuated electric alternators to produce
      electric power.<br>
      <br>
      However, the concept is in need of certain optimizations,
      practical improvements, and simplifications. Little effort has
      been directed toward developing a practical system for utilizing
      PC-driven standing waves as a means of electric power production.
      When compared to contemporary technologies, such as gas turbines,
      a PC electric power generator would provide a fuel-to-electric
      conversion system of extraordinary simplicity.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      It is an object of the present invention to provide pulse
      combustion (PC) driven acoustic resonators whose vibratory motion
      is used to drive an electric alternator.<br>
      <br>
      A further object of the present invention is to employ resonant
      macrosonic synthesis (RMS) resonators as a PC chamber in order to
      maximize the acoustic reaction force for a given fuel consumption
      rate, thereby improving fuel-to-electric transduction efficiency.<br>
      <br>
      A still further object of the present invention is to increase the
      power density of a PC by providing tuned induction as well as
      pre-heating and premixing of the combustion reactants.<br>
      <br>
      An even further object of the present invention is to provide a
      comparatively inexpensive technology for converting fuels such as
      natural gas into electric power.<br>
      <br>
      An additional object of the present invention is to provide needed
      optimizations and practical improvements to thermoacoustic
      electric power generators.<br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b><br>
      <br>
      Acoustically driven structural vibration of the combustion chamber
      (the resonator) is typically an unwanted byproduct of PC
      operation. Considerable research is directed toward minimizing
      this unwanted effect. In contrast, the present invention exploits
      these vibrations as a means of creating electric power by allowing
      the entire resonator to be driven back and forth in response to
      the standing wave's dynamic pressure.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 1 shows an embodiment of the present invention where a RMS
      resonator 2 is provided, which is resiliently mounted to the
      stationary surrounding environment by springs 3 and 5 thereby
      being unrestrained and free to vibrate along its cylindrical axis
      z. Resonator 2 has a rigid end wall 26, an annular exhaust port
      24, annular exhaust plenum 25, optional throttle valve 14, spark
      plug 22, and a valve head 4. Valve head 4 comprises a
      fuel-oxidizer plenum 6, a fuel inlet 8, an oxidizer inlet 10 and
      reactant inlet valves 12.<br>
      <br>
      Connected to resonator 2 is alternator 16 comprising armature 18
      which is rigidly connected to resonator 2 and stator 20 which is
      resiliently connected to armature 18. The resilient connection is
      shown schematically as spring 28 and damper 30. The term stator is
      not used here to imply that stator is stationary. On the contrary,
      stator 20 can be unrestrained and free to vibrate or alternatively
      it can be rigidly restrained. Optionally, armature 18 could be
      spring mounted to resonator 2 in order to provide further control
      of the relative vibrational phases of stator 20, armature 18, and
      resonator 2.<br>
      <br>
      Many methods exist for starting pulse combustors and spark plug 22
      provides one such approach. In operation, spark plug 22 creates a
      spark which initiates the combustion of the fuel-oxidizer mixture
      inside resonator 2. This initial combustion starts the well known
      self-sustaining PC cycle which is driven by the resultant
      oscillating pressure inside resonator 2. Once started, the spark
      plug can be deactivated and the PC system will run at its
      characteristic resonant frequency.<br>
      <br>
      Other methods can be used to vary the resonant frequency such as a
      spark timing control circuit 7 in FIG. 1 and rotary valves both of
      which are per say well known. Variably-tuned resonator branches
      could also be used to vary the resonant frequency. For example, a
      variably tuned branch could comprise a narrow cylindrical tube
      having one end which opens into the combustion resonator and the
      other end fitted with a tuning piston. The resonant frequency of
      the combustion chamber could be varied by sliding the tuning
      piston within the tube.<br>
      <br>
      Combustion products exit resonator 2 through annular port 24 which
      must have sufficient flow area to support the design exhaust flow
      rate. FIG. 2 illustrates the fundamental mode's peak pressure
      distribution along the length of resonator 2, where z is its
      axi-symmetric axis for which z=0 at the narrow end and z=L at the
      wide end. Although port 24 can be placed anywhere within the walls
      of resonator 2, the preferred placement corresponds to the
      fundamental's pressure node shown in FIG. 2 which will tend to
      minimize the transmission of dynamic pressure through port 24. If
      dynamic pressure is transmitted through port 24, then it can no
      longer be converted into useable force as described below. In
      general, exhaust port placement should be chosen so as to maximize
      the resonator's internal dynamic pressure. Port 24 could be fitted
      with optional throttle valve 14 or could be equipped with
      compressor-type discharge valves such as reed valves or plate
      valves which would open in response to the pressure difference
      across the valve.<br>
      <br>
      Once the standing wave is established its oscillating pressure
      exerts dynamic forces against the inner walls of resonator 2
      causing it to vibrate as a rigid body along the z direction at the
      acoustic frequency. Armature 18 is attached to resonator 2 and so
      is set into vibration with it. The resulting relative motion of
      armature 18 and stator 20 will create electric power in a manner
      determined by the generator's topology. In the preferred
      embodiment, stator 20 is not stationary but free to move at some
      phase angle with respect to the motion of armature 18. Alternator
      16 could be a voice coil alternator, a variable reluctance
      alternator as shown in U.S. Pat. No. 5,174,130 the entire contents
      of which are hereby incorporated by reference, an alternator as
      shown in U.S. Pat. No. 5,389,844 the entire contents of which are
      hereby incorporated by reference, or any other of a great number
      of linear alternators. Other designs that could be employed, but
      which lack a literal armature and stator, include piezoelectric
      and magnetostrictive alternators. Alternator selection will
      reflect the specific design requirements including frequency of
      operation, the resonator's vibrational displacement amplitude, and
      transduction efficiency between mechanical and electrical power.<br>
      <br>
      The characteristics of the resilient mounting, shown schematically
      as spring 28 and damper 30, between armature 18 and stator 20 will
      affect the transduction efficiency of the system. Optimal power
      factors can be found by modeling the system dynamics and
      accounting for all the moving masses, springs and damping in the
      system. The specific analytical model will reflect the type of
      alternator employed by the system.<br>
      <br>
      The resistance presented to the exhaust flow by port 24, plenum
      and optional throttle valve 14 will influence the average pressure
      P0 upon which the dynamic pressure is superimposed as shown in
      FIG. 2. Other factors influencing the average pressure P0 will
      include the inlet flow resistances, the fluid properties, and the
      resonator geometry. Throttle valve 14 can be used to adjust the
      exhaust flow resistance and thus vary the average pressure P0.
      Increasing the outlet flow resistance will increase P0 and
      decreasing the outlet flow resistance will reduce P0. For a given
      power input, increasing P0 will generally increase the
      peak-to-peak dynamic pressure, thereby increasing the dynamic
      forces on the resonator, resulting in increased electric power
      output. Thus, in order to maximize fuel-to-electric transduction
      efficiency the average pressure P0 should be as high as possible
      as long as the negative peak pressure -P does not rise above the
      reactant supply pressure which would interrupt the intake of fresh
      reactants. If discharge valves are used in combination with port
      24, then both the flow area of the valve system and the valve's
      spring loading, if any, will influence P0. Alternatively,
      compressor-type dynamic discharge valves could be located at z=0
      where discharge pressures are higher resulting in reduced exhaust
      volume flow rates, as shown by FIG. 1A as element 12as.<br>
      <br>
      Preferred embodiments of the present invention use the resonator's
      first longitudinal mode as illustrated by FIGS. 1 and 2 in order
      to maximize the reaction forces and thus the fuel-to-electric
      transduction efficiency as described. Alternatively, rigid wall 26
      could be resiliently attached to resonator 2 with a flexible seal,
      such as a bellows, which would allow wall 26 to vibrate
      independently of resonator 2. Resonator 2 could be rigidly
      restrained while allowing wall 26 to vibrate along the z axis in
      response to the dynamic acoustic pressure, thereby driving
      armature 18 of alternator 16. Also, Helmholtz type resonators
      could be used within the scope of the present invention with an
      alternator also being connected to the resonator as in FIGS. 1 and
      4.<br>
      <br>
      Resonator design plays an important role in optimization of the
      present invention. The particular resonator design chosen will
      determine the dynamic pressure amplitude which can be achieved for
      a given acoustic power input and thus plays an important role in
      determining the fuel-to-electric transduction efficiency of the
      present invention. RMS resonators for obtaining unshocked
      ultrahigh dynamic pressures with specific predetermined waveforms
      are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,515,684 and 5,319,938 and their
      divisional and continuing applications, the entire contents of
      which are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
      <br>
      In general, the vibrating resonator can provide large amounts of
      vibrational mechanical power that can be used to drive an
      electrical alternator, as previously described, or it can be used
      as a linear motor for many other applications. Linear motors are
      widespread and their uses are well known to those skilled in the
      art.<br>
      <br>
      The extremely high amplitude shock-free dynamic pressures of RMS
      resonators can provide another important advantage for pulse
      combustors. RMS resonators can provide compression ratios high
      enough for compression-ignition (CI). Pulse combustors commonly
      rely on the existence of a residual flame to cause ignition after
      fresh reactant intake has occurred. If at any time the residual
      flame is extinguished, then the pulse combustor will cease to
      operate. Operating in CI mode eliminates the need to maintain a
      residual flame inside the combustor chamber, thus providing a more
      robust combustion cycle.<br>
      <br>
      RMS resonators can provide air compressions from 1 atmosphere to
      over 230 psig. An acoustic compression is isentropic and thus can
      provide significant increases in air temperature. For example, an
      isentropic compression of 27 DEG C. air from 1 atmosphere to 100
      psig will raise the air temperature beyond the ignition
      temperature of propane. With approximately 100 DEG C. of preheat,
      this same isentropic 100 psig air compression can reach the
      ignition temperature for methane. When predicting the amount of
      preheat needed for CI to occur the already high temperatures of
      the gas within the combustion chamber must be taken into
      consideration. These high ambient gas temperatures can cause
      significant heat transfer to the incoming reactants and thus
      reduce the amount of preheat required.<br>
      <br>
      Depending on the type of fuel used it may be necessary to use air
      and/or fuel preheating, or a catalyst inside the resonator, to
      initiate compression ignition if a low compression ratio is
      desired by the designer. The addition of small amounts of a
      secondary fuel (e.g. diesel) with a lower ignition Temperature can
      also be used to provide CI of fuels like methane at low
      compression ratios.<br>
      <br>
      RMS pulse combustors can be operated in either residual flame mode
      or CI mode. In either mode, fuel injection can be used, instead of
      pressure operated reed valves, to control the timing of when fuel
      is introduced into the pulse combustor. As shown in FIG. 1
      pressure actuated flapper valves can be used to admit combustion
      reactants into the combustion chamber. Of course, air preheat is
      also an important ignition timing variable regardless of whether
      flapper valves or fuel injection is used.<br>
      <br>
      Regardless of the exact design chosen, combustion must first be
      initiated by a spark plug, glow plug, or other means. For CI
      operation, a spark plug can be used to control the initial
      combustion timing during start-up transients when the dynamic
      pressure is to low to reach ignition temperatures.<br>
      <br>
      One of the advantages of operating in CI mode is that complete
      combustion does not depend on the characteristic time delays of
      flame propagation. In CI mode complete energy release from the
      fuel can occur much faster and thus the pulse combustor can run at
      higher frequencies. This allows a pulse combustor of given power
      output to be downsized, thus increasing its power density and
      reducing its cost. Further increases in power density could be
      made by using hydrogen as a fuel due to its comparatively fast
      combustion. Hydrogen would also provide the environmental
      advantages of not producing the combustion products associated
      with hydrocarbon fuels.<br>
      <br>
      In addition to providing ultrahigh dynamic pressures, RMS
      resonators offer other advantages derived from waveform synthesis.
      For example, FIG. 3 shows an RMS resonator waveform that provides
      .vertline.-.vertline.&gt;.vertline.+P.vertline., where
      .vertline.-P.vertline..tbd.P0 +(-P) and
      .vertline.+P.vertline..tbd.(+P)-P0. This waveform will allow the
      pulse combustor to run at a higher average pressure P0 while still
      keeping the negative peak pressure -P below the reactant supply
      pressure so that the reactant flow is not interrupted. As
      explained, running higher P0 values improves the fuel-to-electric
      energy transduction efficiency. To those skilled in the art, RMS
      resonators will provide numerous enhancements to the present
      invention all of which are considered to be within the scope of
      the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      Another consideration for maximizing P0 is the placement of inlet
      valves 12 in FIG. 1. The small diameter end of resonator 2 will
      provide the largest dynamic pressures and thus the lowest negative
      peak pressure -P for a given value of P0. Consequently, this valve
      placement allows the PC to operate at the highest P0 value with
      all of the advantages cited above. Optionally, the valves could be
      placed at any other location within the walls of the resonator
      where the dynamic pressure of the fundamental exists.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 4 illustrates an embodiment of the present invention
      employing a RMS resonator 32 whose longitudinal symmetry increases
      the acoustic forces on the resonator created by the fundamental
      mode's pressure distribution. The curvature of resonator 32 is
      determined by D(z)=Dth +k[sin(.pi.z/L)], where D is the diameter,
      Dth is the throat or starting diameter, z is the axi-symmetric
      axis of resonator 32, k is a weighting coefficient and L is the
      resonator's total axial length. Alternatively, the curvature of
      resonator 32 could be described by any number of other functions
      including hyperbolic, parabolic or elliptical all of which will
      give different force characteristics.<br>
      <br>
      Resonator 32 is resiliently mounted to the stationary surrounding
      environment by springs 35 and 37 thereby being unrestrained and
      free to vibrate along its cylindrical axis z. Mounted to each end
      of resonator 32 are identical valve heads 34 which allow 2
      combustion events per acoustic cycle thereby increasing the PC
      generator's power density. Alternatively, the pulse combustor of
      FIG. 4 can run with only one valve head at the cost of reduced
      power density. Resonator 32 has an annular exhaust port 39 and
      annular exhaust plenum 38 whose functions are identical to annular
      exhaust port 24 and annular exhaust plenum 25 of FIG. 1. A
      generator 40 is shown schematically which converts the z axis
      vibration of resonator 32 into electric power as described above
      in relation to FIG. 1.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 5 shows the peak pressure distribution of the fundamental
      mode along the length of resonator 32, where z is its
      axi-symmetric axis and +P is the positive peak pressure and -P is
      the negative peak pressure. For the fundamental mode, the local z
      components of the inner surface area are directed so that all the
      local products of pressure and area at any time will produce
      forces on the resonator walls having the same z axis direction.
      This condition will hold as long as dr/dz changes mathematical
      sign wherever the peak pressure distribution changes mathematical
      sign. For resonator 32 this condition occurs at z=L/2, where L is
      the resonator length. In addition to z=L/2, there is a continuum
      of z values at which both dr/dz and the peak pressure distribution
      can be made to change sign together.<br>
      <br>
      The relative dimensions of resonator 32 can be adjusted to further
      increase the acoustically exerted forces by changing the
      maximum-to-minimum diameter ratio. For resonator 32, the maximum
      diameter occurs at z=L/2, and the minimum diameter occurs at z=0
      and z=L, where the diameter=Dd,. For example, if the max/min
      diameter ratio of resonator 32 begins at 1.7 and is increased a
      factor of 7, then the force increases by a factor of 40. This
      assumes that the peak-to-peak dynamic pressure, as measured at Dth
      remains the same for both cases.<br>
      <br>
      Under some circumstances air, or a given oxidizer, must first be
      forced under pressure into the resonator before the reactants can
      be ignited. This same starting method will work with the present
      invention.<br>
      <br>
      Another starting scheme for the present invention is to use the
      alternator as a starting motor so that the PC generator is
      temporarily operated as an acoustic compressor. In start mode, an
      alternating voltage is applied to the motor which then drives the
      resonator back and forth thereby exciting its fundamental resonant
      mode. The valves respond to this mechanically-driven dynamic
      pressure and reactants are drawn into the combustion chamber at
      which time an applied spark can initiate the PC cycle. To avoid
      abruptly switching from motor to alternator mode, the motor could
      be switched off just prior to the firing the ignition spark. Once
      the PC cycle is started the motor is switched back to alternator
      mode, and electric power is provided as described above.<br>
      <br>
      As explained, large P0 values increase the PC generator's
      efficiency and power density. FIG. 6 illustrates another
      embodiment of the present invention which provides even higher P0
      values by means of tuned induction compressors for induction
      ramming. The embodiment of FIG. 6 also provides reactant
      preheating and thorough premixing. These features promote high
      efficiency due to complete burning of reactants as well as rapid
      burn rates for high frequency operation.<br>
      <br>
      In FIG. 6 a resonator 42 is provided whose internal geometry is
      similar in form and function to resonator 32 of FIG. 4. Resonator
      42 is resiliently mounted to the stationary surrounding
      environment by springs 53, 55, 57, and 59 thereby being
      unrestrained and free to vibrate along its cylindrical axis z.
      Resonator 42 has spark plug 43, annular exhaust port 44 and
      annular exhaust plenum 46 whose functions are identical to annular
      exhaust port 39 and annular exhaust plenum 38 of FIG. 4. Mounted
      to each end of resonator 42 are identical acoustic induction
      compressors 48 consisting of tuned plenums 50, first stage valves
      52 and second stage valves 54. Plenums 50 are designed so as to
      have approximately the same resonance frequency as resonator 42.
      Identical heat exchanger cowlings 56 are provided with fuel inlets
      58 and oxidizer inlets 60. Cowlings 56 need not be rigidly
      attached to resonator 42 but must at least form a seal with
      resonator 42 to prevent reactant leakage. If cowlings 56 were
      resiliently mounted so that they need not vibrate with resonator
      42, then they could provide both heat insulation and noise
      suppression. Also, a single inlet could be provided in each
      cowling for fuel and oxidizer rather than the two respective
      openings shown.<br>
      <br>
      Many alternator topologies can be annularly configured so as to
      wrap around resonator 42. For example, FIG. 6 shows a variable
      reluctance alternator 45 which is wrapped annularly around
      resonator 42. Alternator 45 has annular armature 47 which is
      rigidly connected to flange 62 of resonator 42, annular stator 49
      which is resiliently connected to armature 47 via annular spring
      51 and annular linkage 61, drive coil 65 within annular stator 49,
      and drive coil leads 67. Dynamically, alternator 45 will respond
      to the z axis vibration of resonator 42 in the same manner as
      alternator 16 of FIG. 1 responds to the z axis vibration of
      resonator 2.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 7 illustrates the dynamic and static pressure relationships
      of the various stages of compression. In operation, the pulse
      combustion driven standing wave is initiated by spark plug 43.
      Reactant flow proceeds through inlets 58 and 60 at the inlet
      pressure Pinlet-1 and through cowlings 56 where the reactants pick
      up heat from the wall of resonator 42 and experience some degree
      of flow mixing. The vibration of the entire generator assembly
      will excite the fundamental resonance of tuned plenums 50. The
      resulting dynamic pressure inside tuned plenums 50 will draw in
      the heated reactants from cowling 56 through valves 52 and into
      tuned plenums 50 thereby compressing the reactants to the average
      plenum pressure P0-plenum. Inside tuned plenums 50 the reactants
      experience further mixing due to the initial turbulent valve flow
      and then due to the cyclic acoustic particle displacement.<br>
      <br>
      The dynamic pressure inside plenums 50 will compress the reactants
      again from the average plenum pressure P0-plenum up to the plenum
      discharge pressure Pinlet-2 at which time the reactants are
      discharged from plenums 50 through the 2@nd stage valves 54 and
      into resonator 42. The overlap of the plenum's peak acoustic
      pressure and the minimum acoustic pressure of resonator 42 forces
      second stage valves 54 open once per cycle thereby discharging the
      heated and mixed reactants into resonator 42 for combustion. The
      passage of reactants through valves 54 induces further mixing. The
      result of this process as seen in FIG. 7 is an elevated average
      resonator pressure P0-res due to the pressure lift provided by
      induction compressors 48.<br>
      <br>
      Additional induction compressors could be staged if desired to
      provide even higher P0-res values. Cowlings 56 also lend
      themselves to acoustical resonance and could provide additional
      dynamic pressure boost.<br>
      <br>
      Consideration must be given to the acoustic design of resonant
      plenums 50. As shown in FIG. 7, the phase between the plenum's
      standing wave and the resonator's standing wave is essential to
      the compression process. The plenum's resonance is driven by two
      sources: the opening of 2@nd stage valves 54 and the vibratory
      motion of the entire plenum. The superposition of these two
      driving sources must be taken into account when designing the
      plenum geometry. If the plenum resonant frequency is to be equal
      to the resonator's, then the plenum design should ensure that the
      valves are the weaker source.<br>
      <br>
      Many improvements on the embodiment of FIG. 6 will suggest
      themselves to those skilled in the art of tuned compressor or
      engine plenums and pulse combustors. For example, the plenums
      could be tuned to the resonator's 2@nd harmonic in which case the
      2@nd stage valves could act as the sole driving source and the
      proper phases for induction ramming would be provided. Further,
      the ratio of 1@st and 2@nd stage valve areas can be used to
      increase P0-plenum and therefor P0-res. Still further, if
      premixing of the reactants inside cowlings 56 is objectionable for
      safety reasons, then individual oxidizer and fuel cowlings can be
      used which would keep the reactants separated up to the induction
      compressors. Similarly, individual fuel and oxidizer lines could
      be wrapped in annular fashion around the exterior of resonator 42,
      thereby being placed in thermal contact with the hot resonator
      walls.<br>
      <br>
      If a gaseous fuel supply pressure is high enough, then induction
      compressors 48 could be used to compress only the oxidizer and the
      fuel could be provided through a typical gas distributor within
      resonator 42.<br>
      <br>
      Electrically-driven motors are commonly used to drive standing
      wave compressors as is well known in the art. These electric
      motors supply the oscillating force needed for entire resonator
      drive. The induction compressors of the present invention are in
      fact standing wave compressors. As described above the pulse
      combustor of the present invention can be used to directly drive
      these induction, or standing wave, compressors by means of entire
      resonator drive and is referred to herein as engine-drive. In the
      same manner, the is engine-drive can be used to drive a standing
      wave compressor for any application, such as refrigeration and
      air-conditioning, air compression, acoustic vacuum pumps,
      compression of commercial gases, compression of natural gas, to
      name a few. In general, engine-drive can be used to drive a RMS
      resonator for any of the many RMS applications.<br>
      <br>
      As an alternative to PC, the standing acoustic waves of the
      present invention can be driven thermoacoustically. As described,
      current proposals for thermoacoustically driven electric
      generators require the coupling of a piston to an open end of the
      acoustic resonator and allowing the vibrating piston to drive a
      linear alternator. This piston would require a gas seal such as a
      diaphragm or bellows which raises issues of reliability. The
      dynamic forces produced by this system are limited by acoustic
      pressure amplitude and by the surface area of the piston.<br>
      <br>
      Rather than being limited by a piston's surface area, the present
      invention utilizes the entire inner surface area of the resonator
      and so can generate very large dynamic forces. The use of RMS
      resonators further increases the desired dynamic forces by
      providing extremely high dynamic pressures.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 8 illustrates a thermoacoustically-driven embodiment of the
      present invention. An explanation of thermoacoustic engine
      fundamentals can be found in G. W. Swift, "Thermoacoustic
      Engines," J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 84, 1169 (1988). In FIG. 8, a rigid
      walled resonator 63 having heat plate stacks 64 is operated in the
      prime mover mode as is well known in the art of thermoacoustic
      engines. Resonator 63 is resiliently mounted to the stationary
      surrounding environment by springs 72 and 74 thereby being
      unrestrained and free to vibrate along its cylindrical axis z.
      Heat is applied at heat exchangers 66 and extracted at heat
      exchangers 68 so as to provide a temperature gradient along the
      plate stack sufficient for driving the standing acoustic wave.
      Once the standing wave is established its oscillating pressure
      exerts dynamic force, against the walls of resonator 63 causing it
      to vibrate as a rigid body along z at the acoustic frequency in
      response to these dynamic forces. As before, a generator 70 is
      shown schematically which converts the z axis vibration of
      resonator 32 into electric power.<br>
      <br>
      The art of thermoacoustic engines is well developed and will
      suggest many methods and techniques to one skilled in the art for
      implementing the embodiment of FIG. 8. For example, the use of two
      plate stacks is optional. In addition, plate stacks can be used
      with RMS resonators to achieve high pressure amplitudes for a
      desired waveform and with all of the advantages previously
      described. Further, heat sources used for the embodiment of F IG.
      8 could include waste heat from a PC generator of the type
      described above, waste heat from other processes, direct
      combustion of fuels as well as solar energy to name a few.<br>
      <br>
      While the above description contains many specifications, these
      should not be construed as limitations on the scope of the
      invention, but rather as an exemplification of preferred
      embodiments. Thus, the scope of the present invention is not
      limited to specific pulse combustor designs or thermoacoustic
      designs.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention can be applied wherever electrical power is
      needed. Frequency locking the PC embodiments of the present
      invention to the local power grid frequency may be achieved for
      example with spark timing, the timing of actuated valves such as
      rotary valves or with variably-tuned resonator branches. In this
      way, the generated electric power could be linked to the local
      grid. The AC output from the alternator could be converted to
      other frequencies or to DC. PC generators could be used as the
      onboard power source for hybrid electric vehicles, including those
      that store energy in mechanical flywheels where gas turbines are
      currently used. The present invention can be sized for various
      power output requirements.<br>
      <br>
      The PC literature provides a diversity of pulse combustor designs
      and enhancements including the use of gaseous or liquid fuels,
      fuel distributor heads, the number of valves used, valved and
      areovalved combustors, multiple combustors, fuel-oxidizer mixing,
      valve styles including flappers, Tesla valves, and rotary valves.

      </b><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>1) Field of Invention</b><br>
      <br>
      This invention relates to Resonant Macrosonic Synthesis (RMS)
      resonators which are either pulse combustion driven or
      thermoacoustically driven for the purpose of energy conversion,
      having specific applications to electric power production.<br>
      <br>
      <b>2) Description of Related Art</b><br>
      <br>
      History reveals a rich variety of technologies conceived for the
      purpose of electric power production. Of particular interest are
      those technologies designed to combust liquid or gaseous fuels in
      order to produce electric power.<br>
      <br>
      Many types of internal combustion engines have been employed which
      convert the chemical potential energy of fuels into mechanical
      energy which is used to drive an electric alternator. However,
      internal combustion engines need frequent periodic maintenance and
      provide low conversion efficiencies. Currently, turbines provide
      the most efficient conversion of fuels, such as natural gas, into
      electric power. The design and manufacturing sophistication which
      is inherent in turbine technology can be seen in both their
      initial cost and operating cost.<br>
      <br>
      Some effort has been directed to the field of standing acoustic
      waves as a means of electric power production. For example, it was
      suggested by Swift that the oscillating pressure of
      thermoacoustically driven standing waves could be utilized for
      driving an alternator to produce electric power (G. W. Swift,
      "Thermoacoustic Engines," J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 84, 1166 (1988)).
      This would be accomplished by coupling a piston to an open end of
      the acoustic resonator and allowing the vibrating piston to drive
      a linear alternator The piston would require a gas seal such as a
      diaphragm or bellows which raises issues of reliability. Moving
      pistons also limit the dynamic force which can be extracted from
      the standing wave, thereby limiting the thermoacoustic generator's
      efficiency.<br>
      <br>
      Another application of standing acoustic waves to the production
      of electric power was reported by Swift which exploited Magneto
      Hydrodynamic effects in a thermoacoustically driven liquid sodium
      standing wave engine (G. W. Swift, "Thermoacoustic Engines," J.
      Acoust. Soc. Am. 84, 1169 (1988)).<br>
      <br>
      Pulse combustion (PC) is a further field of research where
      electric power production has been proposed in connection with
      standing acoustic waves. Other than Magneto Hydrodynamics the PC
      field has apparently received little attention as a means of
      producing electric power. Considerable research and development
      has occurred in the PC field dating back to the previous century.
      In the early 1920s pulse combustors first received attention as a
      means to drive electric power producing turbines as seen in U.S.
      Pat. No. 1,329,559 to Nikola Tesla. Most of the applications
      research performed today relates to producing either heat or
      propulsive thrust. For these applications, pulse combustors have
      always been comparatively attractive, due to their self-sustaining
      combustion cycle, inherent simplicity, and low production of
      pollutants. Putnam, Belles, and Kentfield provide a comprehensive
      history of pulse combustor development showing many of the
      embodiments and applications in the art of pulse combustion (A. A.
      Putnam, F. E. Belles, and J. A. C. Kentfield, "Pulse Combustion,"
      Prog. Energy Combust. Sci. 12, 43-79 (1986)). The field of PC
      research is very active with significant efforts taking place at
      institutions such as the Gas Research Institute, Sandia Combustion
      Labs, and various universities.<br>
      <br>
      In summary, thermoacoustic engines have been proposed as a means
      of driving piston-actuated electric alternators to produce
      electric power.<br>
      <br>
      However, the concept is in need of certain optimizations,
      practical improvements, and simplifications. Little effort has
      been directed toward developing a practical system for utilizing
      PC-driven standing waves as a means of electric power production.
      When compared to contemporary technologies, such as gas turbines,
      a PC electric power generator would provide a fuel-to-electric
      conversion system of extraordinary simplicity.<br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b><br>
      <br>
      Acoustically driven structural vibration of the combustion chamber
      (the resonator) is typically an unwanted byproduct of PC
      operation. Considerable research is directed toward minimizing
      this unwanted effect. In contrast, the present invention exploits
      these vibrations as a means of creating electric power by allowing
      the entire resonator to be driven back and forth in response to
      the standing wave's dynamic pressure.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 1 shows an embodiment of the present invention where a RMS
      resonator 2 is provided, which is resiliently mounted to the
      stationary surrounding environment by springs 3 and 5 thereby
      being unrestrained and free to vibrate along its cylindrical axis
      z. Resonator 2 has a rigid end wall 26, an annular exhaust port
      24, annular exhaust plenum 25, optional throttle valve 14, spark
      plug 22, and a valve head 4. Valve head 4 comprises a
      fuel-oxidizer plenum 6, a fuel inlet 8, an oxidizer inlet 10 and
      reactant inlet valves 12.<br>
      <br>
      Connected to resonator 2 is alternator 16 comprising armature 18
      which is rigidly connected to resonator 2 and stator 20 which is
      resiliently connected to armature 18. The resilient connection is
      shown schematically as spring 28 and damper 30. The term stator is
      not used here to imply that stator is stationary. On the contrary,
      stator 20 can be unrestrained and free to vibrate or alternatively
      it can be rigidly restrained. Optionally, armature 18 could be
      spring mounted to resonator 2 in order to provide further control
      of the relative vibrational phases of stator 20, armature 18, and
      resonator 2.<br>
      <br>
      Many methods exist for starting pulse combustors and spark plug 22
      provides one such approach. In operation, spark plug 22 creates a
      spark which initiates the combustion of the fuel-oxidizer mixture
      inside resonator 2. This initial combustion starts the well known
      self-sustaining PC cycle which is driven by the resultant
      oscillating pressure inside resonator 2. Once started, the spark
      plug can be deactivated and the PC system will run at its
      characteristic resonant frequency.<br>
      <br>
      Other methods can be used to vary the resonant frequency such as a
      spark timing control circuit 7 in FIG. 1 and rotary valves both of
      which are per say well known. Variably-tuned resonator branches
      could also be used to vary the resonant frequency. For example, a
      variably tuned branch could comprise a narrow cylindrical tube
      having one end which opens into the combustion resonator and the
      other end fitted with a tuning piston. The resonant frequency of
      the combustion chamber could be varied by sliding the tuning
      piston within the tube.<br>
      <br>
      Combustion products exit resonator 2 through annular port 24 which
      must have sufficient flow area to support the design exhaust flow
      rate. FIG. 2 illustrates the fundamental mode's peak pressure
      distribution along the length of resonator 2, where z is its
      axi-symmetric axis for which z=0 at the narrow end and z=L at the
      wide end. Although port 24 can be placed anywhere within the walls
      of resonator 2, the preferred placement corresponds to the
      fundamental's pressure node shown in FIG. 2 which will tend to
      minimize the transmission of dynamic pressure through port 24. If
      dynamic pressure is transmitted through port 24, then it can no
      longer be converted into useable force as described below. In
      general, exhaust port placement should be chosen so as to maximize
      the resonator's internal dynamic pressure. Port 24 could be fitted
      with optional throttle valve 14 or could be equipped with
      compressor-type discharge valves such as reed valves or plate
      valves which would open in response to the pressure difference
      across the valve.<br>
      <br>
      Once the standing wave is established its oscillating pressure
      exerts dynamic forces against the inner walls of resonator 2
      causing it to vibrate as a rigid body along the z direction at the
      acoustic frequency. Armature 18 is attached to resonator 2 and so
      is set into vibration with it. The resulting relative motion of
      armature 18 and stator 20 will create electric power in a manner
      determined by the generator's topology. In the preferred
      embodiment, stator 20 is not stationary but free to move at some
      phase angle with respect to the motion of armature 18. Alternator
      16 could be a voice coil alternator, a variable reluctance
      alternator as shown in U.S. Pat. No. 5,174,130 the entire contents
      of which are hereby incorporated by reference, an alternator as
      shown in U.S. Pat. No. 5,389,844 the entire contents of which are
      hereby incorporated by reference, or any other of a great number
      of linear alternators. Other designs that could be employed, but
      which lack a literal armature and stator, include piezoelectric
      and magnetostrictive alternators. Alternator selection will
      reflect the specific design requirements including frequency of
      operation, the resonator's vibrational displacement amplitude, and
      transduction efficiency between mechanical and electrical power.<br>
      <br>
      The characteristics of the resilient mounting, shown schematically
      as spring 28 and damper 30, between armature 18 and stator 20 will
      affect the transduction efficiency of the system. Optimal power
      factors can be found by modeling the system dynamics and
      accounting for all the moving masses, springs and damping in the
      system. The specific analytical model will reflect the type of
      alternator employed by the system.<br>
      <br>
      The resistance presented to the exhaust flow by port 24, plenum
      and optional throttle valve 14 will influence the average pressure
      P0 upon which the dynamic pressure is superimposed as shown in
      FIG. 2. Other factors influencing the average pressure P0 will
      include the inlet flow resistances, the fluid properties, and the
      resonator geometry. Throttle valve 14 can be used to adjust the
      exhaust flow resistance and thus vary the average pressure P0.
      Increasing the outlet flow resistance will increase P0 and
      decreasing the outlet flow resistance will reduce P0. For a given
      power input, increasing P0 will generally increase the
      peak-to-peak dynamic pressure, thereby increasing the dynamic
      forces on the resonator, resulting in increased electric power
      output. Thus, in order to maximize fuel-to-electric transduction
      efficiency the average pressure P0 should be as high as possible
      as long as the negative peak pressure -P does not rise above the
      reactant supply pressure which would interrupt the intake of fresh
      reactants. If discharge valves are used in combination with port
      24, then both the flow area of the valve system and the valve's
      spring loading, if any, will influence P0. Alternatively,
      compressor-type dynamic discharge valves could be located at z=0
      where discharge pressures are higher resulting in reduced exhaust
      volume flow rates, as shown by FIG. 1A as element 12as.<br>
      <br>
      Preferred embodiments of the present invention use the resonator's
      first longitudinal mode as illustrated by FIGS. 1 and 2 in order
      to maximize the reaction forces and thus the fuel-to-electric
      transduction efficiency as described. Alternatively, rigid wall 26
      could be resiliently attached to resonator 2 with a flexible seal,
      such as a bellows, which would allow wall 26 to vibrate
      independently of resonator 2. Resonator 2 could be rigidly
      restrained while allowing wall 26 to vibrate along the z axis in
      response to the dynamic acoustic pressure, thereby driving
      armature 18 of alternator 16. Also, Helmholtz type resonators
      could be used within the scope of the present invention with an
      alternator also being connected to the resonator as in FIGS. 1 and
      4.<br>
      <br>
      Resonator design plays an important role in optimization of the
      present invention. The particular resonator design chosen will
      determine the dynamic pressure amplitude which can be achieved for
      a given acoustic power input and thus plays an important role in
      determining the fuel-to-electric transduction efficiency of the
      present invention. RMS resonators for obtaining unshocked
      ultrahigh dynamic pressures with specific predetermined waveforms
      are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,515,684 and 5,319,938 and their
      divisional and continuing applications, the entire contents of
      which are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
      <br>
      In general, the vibrating resonator can provide large amounts of
      vibrational mechanical power that can be used to drive an
      electrical alternator, as previously described, or it can be used
      as a linear motor for many other applications. Linear motors are
      widespread and their uses are well known to those skilled in the
      art.<br>
      <br>
      The extremely high amplitude shock-free dynamic pressures of RMS
      resonators can provide another important advantage for pulse
      combustors. RMS resonators can provide compression ratios high
      enough for compression-ignition (CI). Pulse combustors commonly
      rely on the existence of a residual flame to cause ignition after
      fresh reactant intake has occurred. If at any time the residual
      flame is extinguished, then the pulse combustor will cease to
      operate. Operating in CI mode eliminates the need to maintain a
      residual flame inside the combustor chamber, thus providing a more
      robust combustion cycle.<br>
      <br>
      RMS resonators can provide air compressions from 1 atmosphere to
      over 230 psig. An acoustic compression is isentropic and thus can
      provide significant increases in air temperature. For example, an
      isentropic compression of 27 DEG C. air from 1 atmosphere to 100
      psig will raise the air temperature beyond the ignition
      temperature of propane. With approximately 100 DEG C. of preheat,
      this same isentropic 100 psig air compression can reach the
      ignition temperature for methane. When predicting the amount of
      preheat needed for CI to occur the already high temperatures of
      the gas within the combustion chamber must be taken into
      consideration. These high ambient gas temperatures can cause
      significant heat transfer to the incoming reactants and thus
      reduce the amount of preheat required.<br>
      <br>
      Depending on the type of fuel used it may be necessary to use air
      and/or fuel preheating, or a catalyst inside the resonator, to
      initiate compression ignition if a low compression ratio is
      desired by the designer. The addition of small amounts of a
      secondary fuel (e.g. diesel) with a lower ignition Temperature can
      also be used to provide CI of fuels like methane at low
      compression ratios.<br>
      <br>
      RMS pulse combustors can be operated in either residual flame mode
      or CI mode. In either mode, fuel injection can be used, instead of
      pressure operated reed valves, to control the timing of when fuel
      is introduced into the pulse combustor. As shown in FIG. 1
      pressure actuated flapper valves can be used to admit combustion
      reactants into the combustion chamber. Of course, air preheat is
      also an important ignition timing variable regardless of whether
      flapper valves or fuel injection is used.<br>
      <br>
      Regardless of the exact design chosen, combustion must first be
      initiated by a spark plug, glow plug, or other means. For CI
      operation, a spark plug can be used to control the initial
      combustion timing during start-up transients when the dynamic
      pressure is to low to reach ignition temperatures.<br>
      <br>
      One of the advantages of operating in CI mode is that complete
      combustion does not depend on the characteristic time delays of
      flame propagation. In CI mode complete energy release from the
      fuel can occur much faster and thus the pulse combustor can run at
      higher frequencies. This allows a pulse combustor of given power
      output to be downsized, thus increasing its power density and
      reducing its cost. Further increases in power density could be
      made by using hydrogen as a fuel due to its comparatively fast
      combustion. Hydrogen would also provide the environmental
      advantages of not producing the combustion products associated
      with hydrocarbon fuels.<br>
      <br>
      In addition to providing ultrahigh dynamic pressures, RMS
      resonators offer other advantages derived from waveform synthesis.
      For example, FIG. 3 shows an RMS resonator waveform that provides
      .vertline.-.vertline.&gt;.vertline.+P.vertline., where
      .vertline.-P.vertline..tbd.P0 +(-P) and
      .vertline.+P.vertline..tbd.(+P)-P0. This waveform will allow the
      pulse combustor to run at a higher average pressure P0 while still
      keeping the negative peak pressure -P below the reactant supply
      pressure so that the reactant flow is not interrupted. As
      explained, running higher P0 values improves the fuel-to-electric
      energy transduction efficiency. To those skilled in the art, RMS
      resonators will provide numerous enhancements to the present
      invention all of which are considered to be within the scope of
      the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      Another consideration for maximizing P0 is the placement of inlet
      valves 12 in FIG. 1. The small diameter end of resonator 2 will
      provide the largest dynamic pressures and thus the lowest negative
      peak pressure -P for a given value of P0. Consequently, this valve
      placement allows the PC to operate at the highest P0 value with
      all of the advantages cited above. Optionally, the valves could be
      placed at any other location within the walls of the resonator
      where the dynamic pressure of the fundamental exists.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 4 illustrates an embodiment of the present invention
      employing a RMS resonator 32 whose longitudinal symmetry increases
      the acoustic forces on the resonator created by the fundamental
      mode's pressure distribution. The curvature of resonator 32 is
      determined by D(z)=Dth +k[sin(.pi.z/L)], where D is the diameter,
      Dth is the throat or starting diameter, z is the axi-symmetric
      axis of resonator 32, k is a weighting coefficient and L is the
      resonator's total axial length. Alternatively, the curvature of
      resonator 32 could be described by any number of other functions
      including hyperbolic, parabolic or elliptical all of which will
      give different force characteristics.<br>
      <br>
      Resonator 32 is resiliently mounted to the stationary surrounding
      environment by springs 35 and 37 thereby being unrestrained and
      free to vibrate along its cylindrical axis z. Mounted to each end
      of resonator 32 are identical valve heads 34 which allow 2
      combustion events per acoustic cycle thereby increasing the PC
      generator's power density. Alternatively, the pulse combustor of
      FIG. 4 can run with only one valve head at the cost of reduced
      power density. Resonator 32 has an annular exhaust port 39 and
      annular exhaust plenum 38 whose functions are identical to annular
      exhaust port 24 and annular exhaust plenum 25 of FIG. 1. A
      generator 40 is shown schematically which converts the z axis
      vibration of resonator 32 into electric power as described above
      in relation to FIG. 1.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 5 shows the peak pressure distribution of the fundamental
      mode along the length of resonator 32, where z is its
      axi-symmetric axis and +P is the positive peak pressure and -P is
      the negative peak pressure. For the fundamental mode, the local z
      components of the inner surface area are directed so that all the
      local products of pressure and area at any time will produce
      forces on the resonator walls having the same z axis direction.
      This condition will hold as long as dr/dz changes mathematical
      sign wherever the peak pressure distribution changes mathematical
      sign. For resonator 32 this condition occurs at z=L/2, where L is
      the resonator length. In addition to z=L/2, there is a continuum
      of z values at which both dr/dz and the peak pressure distribution
      can be made to change sign together.<br>
      <br>
      The relative dimensions of resonator 32 can be adjusted to further
      increase the acoustically exerted forces by changing the
      maximum-to-minimum diameter ratio. For resonator 32, the maximum
      diameter occurs at z=L/2, and the minimum diameter occurs at z=0
      and z=L, where the diameter=Dd,. For example, if the max/min
      diameter ratio of resonator 32 begins at 1.7 and is increased a
      factor of 7, then the force increases by a factor of 40. This
      assumes that the peak-to-peak dynamic pressure, as measured at Dth
      remains the same for both cases.<br>
      <br>
      Under some circumstances air, or a given oxidizer, must first be
      forced under pressure into the resonator before the reactants can
      be ignited. This same starting method will work with the present
      invention.<br>
      <br>
      Another starting scheme for the present invention is to use the
      alternator as a starting motor so that the PC generator is
      temporarily operated as an acoustic compressor. In start mode, an
      alternating voltage is applied to the motor which then drives the
      resonator back and forth thereby exciting its fundamental resonant
      mode. The valves respond to this mechanically-driven dynamic
      pressure and reactants are drawn into the combustion chamber at
      which time an applied spark can initiate the PC cycle. To avoid
      abruptly switching from motor to alternator mode, the motor could
      be switched off just prior to the firing the ignition spark. Once
      the PC cycle is started the motor is switched back to alternator
      mode, and electric power is provided as described above.<br>
      <br>
      As explained, large P0 values increase the PC generator's
      efficiency and power density. FIG. 6 illustrates another
      embodiment of the present invention which provides even higher P0
      values by means of tuned induction compressors for induction
      ramming. The embodiment of FIG. 6 also provides reactant
      preheating and thorough premixing. These features promote high
      efficiency due to complete burning of reactants as well as rapid
      burn rates for high frequency operation.<br>
      <br>
      In FIG. 6 a resonator 42 is provided whose internal geometry is
      similar in form and function to resonator 32 of FIG. 4. Resonator
      42 is resiliently mounted to the stationary surrounding
      environment by springs 53, 55, 57, and 59 thereby being
      unrestrained and free to vibrate along its cylindrical axis z.
      Resonator 42 has spark plug 43, annular exhaust port 44 and
      annular exhaust plenum 46 whose functions are identical to annular
      exhaust port 39 and annular exhaust plenum 38 of FIG. 4. Mounted
      to each end of resonator 42 are identical acoustic induction
      compressors 48 consisting of tuned plenums 50, first stage valves
      52 and second stage valves 54. Plenums 50 are designed so as to
      have approximately the same resonance frequency as resonator 42.
      Identical heat exchanger cowlings 56 are provided with fuel inlets
      58 and oxidizer inlets 60. Cowlings 56 need not be rigidly
      attached to resonator 42 but must at least form a seal with
      resonator 42 to prevent reactant leakage. If cowlings 56 were
      resiliently mounted so that they need not vibrate with resonator
      42, then they could provide both heat insulation and noise
      suppression. Also, a single inlet could be provided in each
      cowling for fuel and oxidizer rather than the two respective
      openings shown.<br>

      Many alternator topologies can be annularly configured so as to
      wrap around resonator 42. For example, FIG. 6 shows a variable
      reluctance alternator 45 which is wrapped annularly around
      resonator 42. Alternator 45 has annular armature 47 which is
      rigidly connected to flange 62 of resonator 42, annular stator 49
      which is resiliently connected to armature 47 via annular spring
      51 and annular linkage 61, drive coil 65 within annular stator 49,
      and drive coil leads 67. Dynamically, alternator 45 will respond
      to the z axis vibration of resonator 42 in the same manner as
      alternator 16 of FIG. 1 responds to the z axis vibration of
      resonator 2.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 7 illustrates the dynamic and static pressure relationships
      of the various stages of compression. In operation, the pulse
      combustion driven standing wave is initiated by spark plug 43.
      Reactant flow proceeds through inlets 58 and 60 at the inlet
      pressure Pinlet-1 and through cowlings 56 where the reactants pick
      up heat from the wall of resonator 42 and experience some degree
      of flow mixing. The vibration of the entire generator assembly
      will excite the fundamental resonance of tuned plenums 50. The
      resulting dynamic pressure inside tuned plenums 50 will draw in
      the heated reactants from cowling 56 through valves 52 and into
      tuned plenums 50 thereby compressing the reactants to the average
      plenum pressure P0-plenum. Inside tuned plenums 50 the reactants
      experience further mixing due to the initial turbulent valve flow
      and then due to the cyclic acoustic particle displacement.<br>
      <br>
      The dynamic pressure inside plenums 50 will compress the reactants
      again from the average plenum pressure P0-plenum up to the plenum
      discharge pressure Pinlet-2 at which time the reactants are
      discharged from plenums 50 through the 2@nd stage valves 54 and
      into resonator 42. The overlap of the plenum's peak acoustic
      pressure and the minimum acoustic pressure of resonator 42 forces
      second stage valves 54 open once per cycle thereby discharging the
      heated and mixed reactants into resonator 42 for combustion. The
      passage of reactants through valves 54 induces further mixing. The
      result of this process as seen in FIG. 7 is an elevated average
      resonator pressure P0-res due to the pressure lift provided by
      induction compressors 48.<br>
      <br>
      Additional induction compressors could be staged if desired to
      provide even higher P0-res values. Cowlings 56 also lend
      themselves to acoustical resonance and could provide additional
      dynamic pressure boost.<br>
      <br>
      Consideration must be given to the acoustic design of resonant
      plenums 50. As shown in FIG. 7, the phase between the plenum's
      standing wave and the resonator's standing wave is essential to
      the compression process. The plenum's resonance is driven by two
      sources: the opening of 2@nd stage valves 54 and the vibratory
      motion of the entire plenum. The superposition of these two
      driving sources must be taken into account when designing the
      plenum geometry. If the plenum resonant frequency is to be equal
      to the resonator's, then the plenum design should ensure that the
      valves are the weaker source.<br>
      <br>
      Many improvements on the embodiment of FIG. 6 will suggest
      themselves to those skilled in the art of tuned compressor or
      engine plenums and pulse combustors. For example, the plenums
      could be tuned to the resonator's 2@nd harmonic in which case the
      2@nd stage valves could act as the sole driving source and the
      proper phases for induction ramming would be provided. Further,
      the ratio of 1@st and 2@nd stage valve areas can be used to
      increase P0-plenum and therefor P0-res. Still further, if
      premixing of the reactants inside cowlings 56 is objectionable for
      safety reasons, then individual oxidizer and fuel cowlings can be
      used which would keep the reactants separated up to the induction
      compressors. Similarly, individual fuel and oxidizer lines could
      be wrapped in annular fashion around the exterior of resonator 42,
      thereby being placed in thermal contact with the hot resonator
      walls.<br>
      <br>
      If a gaseous fuel supply pressure is high enough, then induction
      compressors 48 could be used to compress only the oxidizer and the
      fuel could be provided through a typical gas distributor within
      resonator 42.<br>
      <br>
      Electrically-driven motors are commonly used to drive standing
      wave compressors as is well known in the art. These electric
      motors supply the oscillating force needed for entire resonator
      drive. The induction compressors of the present invention are in
      fact standing wave compressors. As described above the pulse
      combustor of the present invention can be used to directly drive
      these induction, or standing wave, compressors by means of entire
      resonator drive and is referred to herein as engine-drive. In the
      same manner, the is engine-drive can be used to drive a standing
      wave compressor for any application, such as refrigeration and
      air-conditioning, air compression, acoustic vacuum pumps,
      compression of commercial gases, compression of natural gas, to
      name a few. In general, engine-drive can be used to drive a RMS
      resonator for any of the many RMS applications.<br>
      <br>
      As an alternative to PC, the standing acoustic waves of the
      present invention can be driven thermoacoustically. As described,
      current proposals for thermoacoustically driven electric
      generators require the coupling of a piston to an open end of the
      acoustic resonator and allowing the vibrating piston to drive a
      linear alternator. This piston would require a gas seal such as a
      diaphragm or bellows which raises issues of reliability. The
      dynamic forces produced by this system are limited by acoustic
      pressure amplitude and by the surface area of the piston.<br>
      <br>
      Rather than being limited by a piston's surface area, the present
      invention utilizes the entire inner surface area of the resonator
      and so can generate very large dynamic forces. The use of RMS
      resonators further increases the desired dynamic forces by
      providing extremely high dynamic pressures.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 8 illustrates a thermoacoustically-driven embodiment of the
      present invention. An explanation of thermoacoustic engine
      fundamentals can be found in G. W. Swift, "Thermoacoustic
      Engines," J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 84, 1169 (1988). In FIG. 8, a rigid
      walled resonator 63 having heat plate stacks 64 is operated in the
      prime mover mode as is well known in the art of thermoacoustic
      engines. Resonator 63 is resiliently mounted to the stationary
      surrounding environment by springs 72 and 74 thereby being
      unrestrained and free to vibrate along its cylindrical axis z.
      Heat is applied at heat exchangers 66 and extracted at heat
      exchangers 68 so as to provide a temperature gradient along the
      plate stack sufficient for driving the standing acoustic wave.
      Once the standing wave is established its oscillating pressure
      exerts dynamic force, against the walls of resonator 63 causing it
      to vibrate as a rigid body along z at the acoustic frequency in
      response to these dynamic forces. As before, a generator 70 is
      shown schematically which converts the z axis vibration of
      resonator 32 into electric power.<br>
      <br>
      The art of thermoacoustic engines is well developed and will
      suggest many methods and techniques to one skilled in the art for
      implementing the embodiment of FIG. 8. For example, the use of two
      plate stacks is optional. In addition, plate stacks can be used
      with RMS resonators to achieve high pressure amplitudes for a
      desired waveform and with all of the advantages previously
      described. Further, heat sources used for the embodiment of F IG.
      8 could include waste heat from a PC generator of the type
      described above, waste heat from other processes, direct
      combustion of fuels as well as solar energy to name a few.<br>
      <br>
      While the above description contains many specifications, these
      should not be construed as limitations on the scope of the
      invention, but rather as an exemplification of preferred
      embodiments. Thus, the scope of the present invention is not
      limited to specific pulse combustor designs or thermoacoustic
      designs.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention can be applied wherever electrical power is
      needed. Frequency locking the PC embodiments of the present
      invention to the local power grid frequency may be achieved for
      example with spark timing, the timing of actuated valves such as
      rotary valves or with variably-tuned resonator branches. In this
      way, the generated electric power could be linked to the local
      grid. The AC output from the alternator could be converted to
      other frequencies or to DC. PC generators could be used as the
      onboard power source for hybrid electric vehicles, including those
      that store energy in mechanical flywheels where gas turbines are
      currently used. The present invention can be sized for various
      power output requirements.<br>

      and enhancements including the use of gaseous or liquid fuels,
      fuel distributor heads, the number of valves used, valved and
      areovalved combustors, multiple combustors, fuel-oxidizer mixing,
      valve styles including flappers, Tesla valves, and rotary valves.

      &nbsp;A vibrational acoustic unit comprises a dynamic force motor
      (28), a power take-off spring (34) having one end attached to the
      dynamic force motor (28) and the other end attached to a fluid
      filled acoustic resonator (38). The motor (28) oscillates the

      <b><br>
      </b><b>BACKGROUND OF TEE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Field of Invention</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      This invention relates to power delivery systems for the
      transduction of mechanical power into acoustic power through the
      oscillation of an entire resonator to excite a resonant mode,
      having applications to any acoustic resonator shape.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Description of Related Art</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      There are a number of different ways to deliver power to a
      standing acoustic wave which are known in the field of acoustics.
      The method of entire resonator driving, as described in U. S.
      patents 5,319,938 and 5,515,684, depends on vibrating the entire
      resonator back and forth in order to use the resonator's inner
      surface area as the power delivery surface. This approach requires
      a motor that provides a dynamic force to create the resonator
      oscillation.<br>
      <br>
      As shown in U. S. patents 5,319,938 ; 5,231,337 ; and 5,515,684,
      incorporated herein by reference, motors used for entire resonator
      driving typically comprise two moving motor components. FIG. 1
      illustrates a prior art device where motor component 4 is rigidly
      connected to the fluid-filled acoustic resonator 2, and motor
      component 6 is resiliently mounted to motor component 4 by a
      spring 8. When a dynamic force is generated between these two
      motor components, they move dynamically in reactive opposition to
      each other, thus causing the entire resonator to oscillate so that
      power is delivered to the fluid. The heaver motor component 6 may
      be resiliently connected to ground.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 2 shows a lumped element diagram of the prior art device of
      FIG. 1. The fluid within the resonator is modeled as spring 14 and
      mass 12. Associated with each spring is a damper. Since motor mass
      4a and resonator mass 2a are rigidly connected they comprise a
      single moving mass of the system.<br>
      <br>
      Power is delivered to the standing wave according to 1/(2X)
      FAsinE,(2X) FAsinE, where Z = 2wf with f being the drive
      frequency, F is the magnitude of the force exerted at the face 10
      of motor mass 4a, A is the magnitude of the acceleration of motor
      mass 4a and the resonator mass 2a, and 0 is the (temporal) phase
      angle between F and A. The motor must supply not only the force
      needed to deliver power to the acoustic load but also to directly
      oscillate motor mass 4a and resonator mass 2a back and forth. The
      force required to oscillate masses 2a and 4a is not delivered to
      the acoustic load. However, generating this mass-driving force
      results in energy losses due to the motor's transduction
      efficiency and thus reduces the overall efficiency of the power
      delivery system.<br>
      <br>
      A further source of inefficiency in the prior art system shown in
      FIGS. 1 and 2 is its limited control of the power factor sin0. If
      0 = 90 then the power factor sinA =1. If # assumes values
      progressively less or greater than 90 then the required motor
      force increases thus minimizing the energy efficiency of the power
      delivery system. Adjusting the resonator mass 2a and the motor
      mass 4a can help tune the power factor toward unity, but
      structural stiffness and pressure rating requirements for the
      resonator as well as design requirements for the motor will limit
      the degree of freedom to make such adjustments.<br>
      <br>
      It is well known in the art of vibrational motors that adjusting
      the stiffness of spring 8a of FIG. 2 in order to tune the
      mechanical resonance close to the acoustic resonance will reduce
      the required motor force for a given power delivery. However, this
      can result in greatly amplified displacements between the moving
      components which generate excessive noise and higher spring
      stresses. A control is generally required to keep the drive
      frequency locked to the acoustic resonance since sound speed
      changes due to heating and other effects will cause the acoustic
      resonant frequency to drift during operation. If the mechanical
      resonance frequency is tuned close to the acoustic resonance, then
      severe control problems can occur due to resonance repulsion
      phenomena if the resonant frequency drift brings the two resonant
      peaks too close together.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      It is an object of the present invention to provide a power take
      off (PTO) spring between a dynamic force motor and a resonant
      acoustic load which for a given acoustic power delivery reduces
      the required motor force, reduces the motor size requirement,
      allows greater control of mechanical power factor, reduces motor
      energy dissipation losses due to lower required forces thus
      improving system efficiency, allows tuning of all the relative
      displacements and phases of all oscillating mass components, and
      allows greater design flexibility on overall motor topology. These
      and other objects and advantages of the invention will become
      apparent from the accompanying specifications and drawings,
      wherein like reference numerals refer to like parts throughout.<br>
      <br>
      The invention may be characterized as a vibrational acoustic unit
      comprising a dynamic force motor, a power take-off spring having
      one end attached to the dynamic force motor and the other end
      attached to a fluid filled acoustic resonator, wherein the entire
      acoustic resonator is oscillated so as to excite a resonant mode
      of the acoustic resonator.<br>
      <br>
      The invention may also be characterized as a method of delivering
      power to an acoustic resonator comprising the steps of resiliently
      and exclusively connecting a motor to the resonator, and driving
      the motor to oscillate the entire acoustic resonator so as to
      excite a resonant mode of the acoustic resonator.<br>
      <br>
      The invention may further be characterized as a method of driving
      an acoustic resonator comprising the steps of connecting a motor
      to the resonator using a resilient connection, and driving the
      motor to oscillate the entire acoustic resonator so as to excite a
      resonant mode of the acoustic resonator, the motor exciting the
      resonant mode through the resilient connection.<br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b><br>
      <br>
      FIG. 3 illustrates an embodiment of the present invention where a
      power take off (PTO) spring 20 has been added to the prior art
      device of FIG. 1 between the moving motor mass 18 and resonator
      22. In operation, an dynamic force of frequency f is created
      between motor mass 14 and motor mass 18 which causes motor masses
      14 and 18 to oscillate at frequency f in reactive opposition to
      each other. The periodic displacement of motor mass 18 causes a
      dynamic force to be transmitted through spring 20 to resonator 22
      which in turn causes a periodic displacement of resonator 22 at
      frequency f. If frequency f is equal to a standing wave mode
      frequency of the resonator which can be excited by the resonator's
      motion, then the periodic displacement of resonator 22 will
      transfer energy to that mode.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 4 provides a lumped element diagram of the embodiment of FIG.
      3, comprising motor mass 14a, motor mass 18a, motor spring 16a,
      PTO spring 20a, resonator mass 22a, fluid spring 24 and fluid mass
      26. When a mode of resonator 22 iq being driven, the phases
      between the displacements of all masses 14a, 18a, 22a, and 26 are
      determined by the respective mass values and by the respective
      stiffness and damping values of motor spring 16a, PTO spring 20a,
      and fluid spring 24.<br>
      <br>
      Adjusting the stiffness of PTO spring 20a of FIG. 4 provides a
      means to tune the mechanical power factor seen by the motor
      (represented by masses 14a and 18a) as it delivers power to the
      resonator, thus reducing the motor force required for a given
      power delivery to the load.<br>
      <br>
      PTO spring 20a also prevents rigid coupling of resonator mass 22a
      with motor mass 18a, thereby making possible designs which reduce
      the motor force required for a given power delivery to the load.
      Reducing the required motor force results in reducing energy
      losses resulting from the motor's transduction efficiency and thus
      improves the overall efficiency of the power delivery system.<br>
      <br>
      Reducing the required motor force also reduces the required size
      of the motor, thus reducing the amount of motor materials required
      for a given power delivery to the load.<br>
      <br>
      PTO spring 20a of FIG. 4 allows power factors approaching unity to
      be achieved without having to tune any of the mechanical
      resonances, associated with springs 16a and 20a, close the driven
      acoustic resonance. Thus, component displacements are minimized,
      noise is reduced, and excessive spring stresses are avoided.
      Providing high power factors, without the risk of crossing
      acoustical and mechanical resonance frequencies, eliminates the
      severe control problems which occur due to resonance repulsion
      phenomena.<br>
      <br>
      The stiffness of each mechanical spring can be chosen so that (i)
      the mechanical resonance frequency where motor spring 20a sees its
      maximum displacement is above the acoustic resonance frequency and
      (ii) the mechanical resonance frequency where spring 16a sees its
      maximum displacement is below the acoustic resonance frequency.<br>
      <br>
      This design provides two preferred operating characteristics.
      First, fluid heating may cause the acoustic resonance frequency to
      increase during operation and this design assures that the
      acoustic resonance frequency will not cross the mechanical
      resonance frequency associated with the maximum displacement of
      spring 16a. Second, provided that the mechanical resonance
      frequency associated with the maximum displacement of spring 20a
      is sufficiently above the acoustic resonance frequency so that the
      two resonances never overlap during operation, then some benefit
      can be derived. As the acoustic resonance frequency increases,
      accelerations can also be made to increase thereby transferring
      more power to the load for the same motor force. Proper selection
      of component mass and spring stiffness can also cause the power
      factor measured at the air gap to improve as the acoustic
      resonance frequency increases.<br>
      <br>
      In general, the addition of PTO spring 20a allows greater system
      design flexibility, since the properties of each mechanical
      element are more independent. PTO spring 20a allows tuning of all
      the relative component displacements, relative displacement
      phases, and component masses.<br>
      <br>
      The power delivery unit should be resiliently mounted to ground,
      since each component of the system oscillates.<br>
      <br>
      For a given design, the specific acceleration of masses depends on
      the mass of each component and stiffness and damping of each
      spring. The mass with the lowest acceleration provides a good
      point for resilient mounting to ground.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 5 shows a cross sectional view of a variable reluctance motor
      used as a two-mass dynamic force motor in accordance with the
      present invention. The variable reluctance motor consists of a
      first motor mass 28 formed by a stack of flat"E"laminations
      rigidly joined together so that the stack forms a single unit, a
      second motor mass 30 formed by a stack of flat"I"laminations
      rigidly joined together so that the stack forms a single unit, a
      conducting coil 32 wound around the center leg of the E lamination
      stack, leaf springs 34, with levels 34a and 34b, which resiliently
      join the first and second motor masses 28 and 30 together via
      carriages 35 and 37, and a PTO leaf spring 36 which resiliently
      connects the second motor mass 30 to resonator 38. Second motor
      mass 30 is rigidly connected to carriage 35, and first motor mass
      28 is rigidly connected to carriage 37. Carriages 35 and 37 slide
      back and forth relative to one another.<br>
      <br>
      The motor laminations can be constructed of silicon steel
      laminations which are typically used in transformers.<br>
      <br>
      The mass of carriage 35 may be considered to be part of the second
      moving mass, and the mass of carriage 37 may be considered to be
      part of the first moving mass. The space between the three legs of
      the E laminations and the<br>
      I laminations comprises an air gap 40. The two levels of leaf
      springs 34, levels 34a and 34b, allow planer relative motion of
      second motor mass 30 and first motor mass 28 so as to keep the
      instantaneous air gap 40 everywhere uniform. Single level springs
      or any other spring topology could also be used which provide
      planer motion of the components.<br>
      <br>
      In operation, when an alternating current is established in coil
      32 a time varying magnetic flux is created within air gap 40 which
      is accompanied by a static attractive force and a time varying
      attractive force between the first and second motor masses 28 and
      30. Motor masses 28 and 30 respond to this time varying force by
      oscillating in reactive opposition to each other. Leaf springs 34
      provide a bias force to prevent the attractive force from drawing
      motor masses 28 and 30 together while still allowing them to
      oscillate. The periodic oscillation of motor mass 30 applies a
      dynamic force through PTO spring 36 to resonator 38, thus causing
      resonator 38 to oscillate along its cylindrical axis. If the
      oscillation frequency of resonator 38 is equal to one of the
      standing wave mode frequencies which can be excited by the
      resonator's motion, then the periodic displacement of resonator 22
      will transfer energy into that mode. Variable reluctance motors
      provide high energy efficiency when small displacements and large
      forces are required, which is typically the case for acoustic
      resonators.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 6 shows a variable reluctance motor used as a two-mass
      dynamic force motor in accordance with the present invention,
      which reduces the portion of total magnetic losses caused by
      non-grain oriented magnetic flux. The variable reluctance motor
      consists of a first motor mass 40 formed by tape-wound laminations
      and joined to each other so as to form a single unit, a second
      motor mass 42 formed by tape-wound laminations and joined to each
      other so as to form a single unit, a conducting coil 44 wound
      around the center leg of the first motor mass, leaf springs 46
      which resiliently join the first and second motor masses 40 and 42
      together via carriages 47 and 49, and a PTO leaf spring 48 which
      resiliently connects the second motor mass 42 to resonator 50. The
      mass of carriage 47 may be considered to be part of the second
      moving mass, and the mass of carriage 49 may be considered to be
      part of the first moving mass. In operation the motor of FIG. 6
      operates in the same manner as the motor of FIG. 5.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 7 illustrates an alternative magnetic structure for a
      variable-reluctance motor having first motor mass 52 formed of two
      tape-wound laminations and a second motor mass 54 formed of a
      single tape-wound lamination.<br>
      <br>
      While second motor mass 54 does not prevent cross-grain field
      orientation, it does provide a simple and very rigid structure
      having ends 56 and 58 which provide convenient connection points
      for springs, carriages or other hardware. Many combinations of
      tape-wound and stacked flat lamination components can be combined
      based on given design requirements and will suggest themselves to
      those skilled in the art.<br>
      <br>
      The PTO spring of the present invention can be used in combination
      with any type of dynamic force motor. All motors may be thought of
      as providing a dynamic force to a member causing some movement in
      that member, however small. Thus, all the motors, including all
      motors described herein are dynamic force motors.<br>
      <br>
      Fig. 8 describes another type of dynamic force motor.<br>
      <br>
      Fig. 8 illustrates an embodiment of the present invention having a
      PTO spring 64 with one end connected to a flexing dynamic force
      motor 60 and the other end connected to a resonator 66. Reaction
      mass 62 is preferably rigidly connected to flexing dynamic motor
      60 at an end 61 thereof. Reaction mass 62 may be also be
      resiliently connected to flexing dynamic motor 60 at end 61, and
      in this case it is preferred that the resilient connection be
      relatively stiff compared to the spring constant or stiffness of
      PTO spring 64. Flexing dynamic motor 60 can be a piezoelectric
      element, a magnetostrictive element, or any other element which
      provides a dynamic force by periodically flexing or changing its
      overall dimensions.<br>
      <br>
      In operation motor 60 of FIG. 8 undergoes a periodic change in its
      dimension thus creating a dynamic force of frequency f which is
      communicated to resonator 66 through PTO spring 64. In embodiments
      in which the dynamic force motor 60 has a small mass relative to
      that of the reaction mass 62, the force of the motor 60 is
      effectively transferred to the resonator 66 by virtue of the
      reaction mass 62 and PTO spring 64 which causes the periodic
      displacement of resonator 66 at frequency f.<br>
      <br>
      Reaction mass 62 prevents excessive accelerations of the reaction
      mass end 61 of motor 60 and maximizes the force of motor 60
      applied to PTO spring 64. If the frequency f is equal to a
      standing wave mode frequency of the resonator which can be excited
      by the resonator's motion, then the periodic displacement of
      resonator 66 will transfer energy into that mode. The embodiment
      of FIG. 8 can be operated without PTO spring 64 by rigidly
      connecting motor 60 to resonator 66. However, this would eliminate
      the advantages described above.<br>
      <br>
      It may be seen that the embodiments of the invention utilize the
      PTO spring as the exclusive mechanism to couple the active force
      components of the motor to the resonator. Thus, the moving
      elements of the motor which are effective in causing oscillation
      of the resonator are isolated from the resonator by the resilient
      coupling mechanism, i. e., the PTO spring. In contrast, prior art
      devices couple the motor to the resonator by a rigid connection
      and do not utilize a PTO spring as the primary force path from the
      motor to the resonator.<br>
      <br>
      While the above description contains many embodiments of the
      invention, these should not be construed as limitations on the
      scope of the invention, but rather as an exemplification of
      preferred embodiments thereof.<br>
      <br>
      Other embodiments which will occur to those skilled in the art are
      within the scope of the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      For example, any motor which generates a dynamic force can be
      employed such as off-concentric rotational motors, electrodynamic
      motors, and electromagnetic motors.<br>
      <br>
      Variable reluctance motors need not use only laminations but can
      be formed from pressed materials that have multidirectional grain
      properties so as to avoid off-axis grain magnetic losses. The
      springs may comprise any spring type which accommodates a
      particular design such as coil springs, leaf springs, bellville
      springs, magnetic springs, gas springs or other devices that
      provide a resilient coupling. The fluids within the resonators of
      the present invention can be either liquids or gases. Any type of
      acoustic resonator can be used including cylindrical resonators or
      Resonant Macrosonic Synthesis (RMS) resonators of any shape as
      described for example in U. S. patents 5,515,684,5,319,938, and
      5,174,130 the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by
      reference.<br>
      <br>
      It should further be appreciated that an excited resonance mode of
      the resonator may generally take place anywhere on the resonance
      response curve as, for example, at full or near full power, at
      half power points, quarter power points or the like. Thus a
      resonant mode can be excited over a range of frequencies.<br>
      <br>
      The scope of the present invention is not limited to particular
      applications of the acoustic resonator to which power is
      delivered. For example the present invention can be applied to
      acoustic resonators for oilless acoustic compressors and pumps for
      air compression, refrigeration, comfort air-conditioning,
      hazardous fluids, ultra-pure fluids, natural gas, and commercial
      gases; acoustic resonators for process control ; acoustic
      resonators used as process reactors for chemical and
      pharmaceutical industries ; acoustic resonators for separation of
      gases including pressure swing adsorption ; and acoustic
      resonators for agglomeration, levitation, mixing, and
      pulverization to name a few. Such applications may or may not
      include RMS resonators.<br>
      <br>
      While omitted for clarity, such applications of the invention may
      utilize inlet/outlet valves and heat exchange apparatus as shown
      in Figure 13 of patent 5,319,938 and Figure 16 of patent
      5,515,684.<br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, the scope of the invention should be determined not
      by the embodiments illustrated, but by the appended claims and
      their equivalents.<br>

      <br>
      Physical effects produced within RMS resonators are utilized as a
      means to process materials within the resonator including for
      example one or more of comminution, converting liquids into vapors
      and gases, drying of powders, rapid mixing of gases and various
      materials, agglomeration, de-agglomeration, granulation, chemical
      reactions, stratification/separation, and the destruction of
      biological material.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE CURRENT INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      <b>1) Field of Invention</b><br>
      <br>
      This invention relates to the application of Resonant Macrosonic
      Synthesis (RMS) for the purposes of processing materials within an
      RMS resonator including, for example, comminution, converting
      liquids into vapors and gases, drying of powders, mixing of
      dissimilar materials, agglomeration, de-agglomeration,
      granulation, sterilization of gases, destruction of biological
      materials, separation by stratification, and coal gasification.<br>
      <br>
      <b>2) Description of Related Area</b><br>
      <br>
      Previously, the processing of materials such as comminution,
      converting liquids into vapors and gases, drying of powders, rapid
      mixing of gases and various materials including mixtures of
      particulate solids, agglomeration, de-agglomeration, and
      granulation required a wide range of different processing
      equipment. Examples of such equipment can include rotary cutters,
      hammers, rollers, fluid-energy mills, ovens, and various
      filtration machines.<br>
      <br>
      If the manufacture of a product requires more than one of these
      processes, then the product will often be progressively
      transferred from one machine to another. This can create
      disadvantages, due to reduced yield, product contamination, longer
      process time, and high production costs and worker exposure to
      processing agents.<br>
      <br>
      A single process tool that can provide multiple process steps
      without product transfer and in a simpler manner would provide a
      significant advantage to the process industry.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      It is the object of an embodiment of the present invention to
      utilize the physical effects produced within RMS resonators as a
      means to process materials within the resonator including for
      example one or more of comminution, converting liquids into vapors
      and gases, drying of powders, rapid mixing of gases and various
      materials, agglomeration, de-agglomeration, granulation, chemical
      reactions, stratification/separation, and the destruction of
      biological material.<br>
      <br>
      A further object of an embodiment of the invention is to provide a
      method for processing materials in a self-contained, scaled tool
      for batch.<br>
      <br>
      A still further object is to provide a process tool capable of
      generating a broad range of physical effects, such that multiple
      process steps can be performed within a self-contained, sealed
      tool, which may include simultaneous and sequenced process in a
      batch and/or continuous manner.<br>
      <br>
      Yet another object of an embodiment of the invention is to apply
      an RMS acoustic process tool to process materials.<br>
      <br>
      The RMS acoustic process tool (APT) of the present invention
      consists of an RMS system including an acoustic resonator capable
      of producing: an extremely large range of dynamic pressures, both
      pumping and levitation via nonlinearly-generated DC pressures,
      high acoustic particle velocities, streaming velocities, and
      turbulence. The APT also includes an entire-resonator drive system
      capable of providing the power necessary to produce these effects.<br>
      <br>
      The shape of the APTs resonator is chosen to promote the specific
      effect(s) listed above, which will provide the desired process or
      processes. Inside the resonator is a fluid that serves as the
      medium within which an acoustic standing wave is created. The
      fluid can consist of a liquid, a gas, a vapor, a vapor-gas
      mixture, a liquid or particulate aerosol, or a mixture of any
      number of the forgoing fluids. The method of operation is such
      that as the actuator oscillates the entire resonator at the
      frequency of one of its acoustic modes, a standing acoustic wave
      is produced.<br>
      <br>
      One of the advantages of the APT is the number of different
      process that can be performed within the same tool during a single
      processing session. Materials within the resonator are exposed to
      physical effects, such as high dynamic pressures, levitation via
      nonlinearly-generated DC pressures, acoustic particle velocities,
      streaming velocities, and turbulence. The relative magnitude of
      these effects is determined by the resonator's shape and the power
      delivered Depending upon the materials introduced into the
      resonator, these physical effects promote various types of
      processing including one or more of: the size reduction of solid
      matter (comminution), agglomeration, de-agglomeration,
      granulation, the vaporization/atomization of liquids, the drying
      of powders, the nixing of dissimilar materials such as gases,
      vapors, and powders, destruction of biological material, and
      chemical reactions.<br>
      <br>
      The rate at which these processes occur can be controlled by
      varying the power delivered to resonator. Many of these individual
      process can be combined to occur concurrently or in a desired
      sequence within a single APT by varying the input power level.<br>
      <br>
      Another advantage of the APT is that the high kinetic energy
      required for certain processes such as rapid mixing, rapid
      de-agglomeration, and communition are created within the resonator
      via the stored energy of the standing wave. This internal energy
      source eliminates the need for external energy sources that are
      outside of the tool, such as external pumps or compressors.<br>
      <br>
      These and other objects and advantages of the invention will
      become apparent from the accompanying drawings, wherein like
      reference numerals refer to like parts throughout.<br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b><br>
      <br>
      FIG. 1 illustrates an acoustic process tool (APT) 2 having driver
      4 and resonator 6 being constructed so as to provide a sealed
      (air-tight) chamber and being filled with a fluid. Materials to be
      processed are placed in the interior 8 of resonator 6. The
      material to be processed can be added to resonator 6 in many ways
      as for example through conduit 10, which can be located anywhere
      on the process tool 2. In general, the internal geometrical shape
      of resonator 6 will determine the pressure and velocity
      distributions and waveforms within interior 8 as described in U.S.
      Pat. No. 5,515,684 incorporated herein by reference. Entire
      resonator driving, as illustrated in FIG. 1, is described in U.S.
      Pat. No. 5,515,684, U.S. Pat. No. 5,319,938, and U.S. patent
      application Ser. No. 08/979,931 now U.S. Pat. No. 5,994,854, the
      entire contents of which are all hereby incorporated by reference.
      FIG. 5 is derived from FIG. 15B of U.S. Pat. No. 5,515,684, and
      illustrates an alternate driving mechanism for the RMS resonator
      74 using piston or diaphragm 80' and electromagnetic driver 94'.
      The scope of the present invention is not limited to the shape of
      resonator 6 in FIG. 1, but instead can have an infinite variety of
      shapes. The specific resonator shape and its resulting
      characteristics will be chosen by the designer to fulfill the
      requirements of a particular application.<br>
      <br>
      In operation driver 4 oscillates resonator 6 at the frequency of
      an acoustic standing wave mode thereby creating a standing
      acoustic wave within resonator 6. The driver is supplied with a
      variable power supply 3 to permit control of the acoustic energy
      within the chamber. In this way standing waves with extremely high
      energy densities can be generated, which provide a range of
      physical effects employed by the present invention. The physical
      effects produced include one or more of high dynamic pressures,
      high ambient temperatures, high dynamic temperatures, levitation
      via nonlinearly-generated DC pressures, high acoustic particle
      velocities, high streaming velocities, and turbulent flow volumes
      of high scale that can fill a substantial portion of the
      resonator's internal volume. U.S. Pat. No. 5,515,684 teaches that
      excessive turbulence can increase the energy dissipation within a
      resonator and also teaches methods to minimize the turbulence. For
      certain RMS applications, such as acoustic compressors, energy
      efficiency can be increased by minimizing turbulence. In contrast,
      many of the processes of the present invention are enhanced by the
      turbulence that is easily created by the high acoustic velocities
      that RMS resonators can provide.<br>
      <br>
      RMS resonators generate the high energy densities and physical
      effects required for APT's to function and enable the new
      processing approaches that ATP's provide. These physical effects
      and their application to particular processes are described as
      follows.<br>
      <br>
      <b>1) Comminution</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Acoustic comminution is facilitated by high amplitude standing
      waves that produce high acoustic velocities, high streaming
      velocities, turbulent flow, and levitation.<br>
      <br>
      The acoustic standing wave exists in the host gas that fills
      resonator 6. The host gas can be air or any number of other gases
      and will be at a pressure that is appropriate for a given process.
      Assuming for example that the first longitudinal mode of resonator
      6 is excited, then the host gas within the resonator will
      oscillate back and forth along the resonator's cylindrical axis,
      changing direction twice during a single acoustic cycle. In RMS
      resonators, these oscillating axial velocities can approach and
      potentially exceed the quiet condition sound speed (MACH 1) in
      that gas.<br>
      <br>
      Other flows within the gas that exert forces on the process
      particles are nonlinearly-driven streaming velocities and
      turbulent flow. At high acoustic amplitudes streaming flow loops
      are generated between pressure nodes and anti-nodes and are also
      created by the particles themselves. The streaming velocities
      created by the particles can exceed the node-to-antinode streaming
      velocities. Also, at high amplitudes the oscillating axial flow
      transitions from laminar flow to turbulent flow.<br>
      <br>
      Another effect due to the presence of the high amplitude acoustic
      wave within resonator 6 is the nonlinearly driven, so called, "DC
      pressure." As known to those skilled in the art, the DC pressure
      varies along the axis of the resonator forming a static pressure
      gradient. This static gradient can levitate objects within the
      resonator. The shape and symmetry of resonator 6 will result in a
      DC pressure distribution having a maxima at ends 12 and 14 and a
      minima at the half-length point 16. FIG. 4 illustrates the type of
      static pressure distribution that would be expected within
      resonator 6. This DC pressure gradient will tend to push the
      process particles away from ends 12 and 14 and towards the center
      of resonator 6.<br>
      <br>
      When the particles to be comminuted are placed within resonator 6
      of FIG. 1 they are typically subjected to all of the forces
      described above. Levitation tends to push the process particles
      away from ends 12 and 14 and keeps them where oscillating axial
      flow, turbulent flow, and streaming flows are high The oscillating
      axial flow will exert a force on the process particles that will
      tend to move them in the direction of the instantaneous axial
      flow. As the particle is accelerated back and forth in response to
      these oscillating axial forces it is also propelled through the
      turbulent flows and streaming flows. The particle itself also
      creates streaming flows that in turn create further unbalanced
      forces that will accelerate the particle.<br>
      <br>
      Consequently, the process particles experience collisions with the
      walls of resonator 6 and with each other. RMS resonators can
      provided energies high enough such that these particle-wall and
      particle-particle collisions will break the process particles into
      smaller pieces, and thereby provide comminution. The present
      invention has been used to comminute materials such as whole
      coffee beans, salt, sugar, and other materials. Micron and
      sub-micron (i.e. nano-phase) sizes can be achieved.<br>
      <br>
      The actual velocities achieved by the process particles will vary
      inversely with particle size. When particles are first introduced
      within resonator 6, their oscillating axial displacement will
      typically be a fraction of the host gas' displacement.<br>
      <br>
      It is the nature of an APT that nearly all of the resonator's
      interior volume can be substantially filled with high velocity
      flow so that process particles are almost continually undergoing
      comminution. In this way the results of the process are enhanced
      and rapid efficient comminution is provided.<br>
      <br>
      The APT comminution process can be employed in many processes such
      as the comminution of pharmaceutical agents, manufacture of
      printer toner, gasification of coal, recovery of precious metals
      from stone and other geological specimens, and plastics recycling.<br>
      <br>
      <b>2) Destruction of biological materials</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The extremely high dynamic, pressures, dynamic temperatures, axial
      and turbulent velocities generated within an RMS resonator can be
      used to sterilize air and other gases by destroying bacteria and
      viruses via exposure to high temperatures and through high energy
      impacts as previously described for comminution.<br>
      <br>
      <b>3) Agglomeration and de-agglomeration</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      As acoustic amplitudes are increased from very low levels, the
      different physical effects previously described will vary in
      magnitude. At amplitudes low enough to avoid substantial
      turbulence, the combined effects of levitation and acoustically
      generated flows will lead to agglomeration of particulate process
      materials. Applications for agglomeration include pollution
      abatement through the removal of ash and other combustion products
      from air. Also, by injecting a granulation-promoting substance (a
      "binder" as it is commonly called) inside of resonator 6 of FIG.
      1, granulation can be accomplished inside the APT.<br>
      <br>
      When the acoustic amplitudes are increased beyond the
      agglomeration level the agglomerated materials within resonator 6
      of FIG. 1 will be de-agglomerated in the same manner and according
      to the same principles as described above for comminution. If so
      desired, low amplitude agglomeration inside the APT can be avoided
      by starting the process at energy levels high enough for
      de-agglomeration. For many applications, de-agglomeration involves
      the breaking of weak bonds between preexisting particles which
      were formed prior to the de-agglomeration process. As such, the
      acoustic amplitudes required for de-agglomeration will be less
      than those required for comminution. This will be the case for
      applications such as pharmaceutical processing where care must be
      taken not to alter the de-agglomerated particle size nor to alter
      the properties of the process materials with excessive
      temperatures and pressures. The APT can be adjusted to run at the
      energy level appropriate for a given application by reducing the
      drive power to the motor.<br>
      <br>
      De-agglomeration applications are found for example in the
      pharmaceutical industry both for continuous and batch operations.
      One particular manufacturing process results in an agglomerated
      cake inside of a sealed blister as shown in FIG. 2. The cake must
      be de-agglomerated into a powder to place the product in its
      intended form for use. In FIG. 2 a pharmaceutical blister pack or
      strip 18 includes a series of blisters 20 with each blister 20
      containing an agglomerated cake 22. In this embodiment of the
      present invention, each blister 20 is supported on blister strip
      18 and serves as the resonator. Each blister 20 is filled with an
      appropriate gas and has a shape that is designed to provide
      acoustic de-agglomeration as previously described. A blister
      volume is typically less than 1 cc and contains an agglomerated
      cake of even smaller volume. Entire resonator drive is employed
      via ultrasonic horn 24, which is driven by ultrasonic driver 28
      connected to variable power supply 23. Axial displacements of the
      horn are small enough to allow the blisters to remain connected to
      the blister strip during resonant driving. Many other types of
      drivers can also be used Horn 24 is temporarily but rigidly joined
      to horn cap 26 during resonant driving. Ultrasonic horn 24 and
      horn cap 26 are shown in cross section and provide a means to
      oscillate the entire blister 20 along its cylindrical axis at the
      desired resonance frequency and also provide extra rigidity to
      blister 20 if needed.<br>
      <br>
      To minimize electronic controls the ultrasonic horn can be swept
      through the blister's resonance frequency once or multiple times
      to excite the acoustic mode and de-agglomerate the cake. The sweep
      rate would be adjusted so as to allow the acoustic amplitude
      within blister 20 to reach the appropriate level for
      de-agglomeration. This process can be automated into steps so that
      horn 24 and horn cap 26 separate and retract after
      de-agglomeration of a blister, the sheet of blisters is advanced
      and horn 24 and horn cap 26 reengage the next blister. Many
      transducers can be operated in parallel at once to increase the
      yield of the same process.<br>
      <br>
      <b>4) Reduction of liquid-to-vapor and liquid-to-gas</b><br>
      <br>
      The process of vaporizing liquids is accomplished, within
      resonator 6 of FIG. 1, in the same manner and according to the
      same principles as described above for comminution. RMS resonators
      can provide enough energy not only to vaporize liquids into
      droplets but to further reduce droplets to the gas phase. As in
      the case of de-agglomeration, care must be taken to use the energy
      required to provide the desired result, whether it be a vapor, a
      gas, or disassociated molecules The APT can be adjusted to run at
      the energy level appropriate for a given application by reducing
      the drive power to the motor.<br>
      <br>
      Typical applications can include vaporization of fuels for
      combustion processes and combustion engines; vaporization of
      liquids for chemical, pharmaceutical, food and beverage, materials
      science, and electronic device manufacturing; and vaporization for
      respiratory drug delivery, where liquid and solid particulate
      aerosols must be created.<br>
      <br>
      <b>5) Mixing of various process materials</b><br>
      <br>
      The process of mixing various materials, such as liquid vapors,
      gases, and powders is accomplished, within resonator 6 of FIG. 1,
      in the same manner and according to the same principles as
      described above for comminution. APTs can rapidly generate
      high-density aerosols. The complex flow field created by the
      superposition of the oscillating axial flow, the turbulent flow,
      and the streaming flows can provide extremely rapid mixing of
      various materials. For each particular combination of process
      materials, care should be taken to use energy levels that will not
      alter the desired properties of the materials.<br>
      <br>
      Typical applications include rapid gas mixing for chemical and
      pharmaceutical applications, rapid fuel-air mixing for combustion
      engines and other combustion processes, and mixing of gases and
      nanophase particles for film depositions, and electronic device
      manufacturing processes.<br>
      <br>
      <b>6) Drying</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The physical effects previously described for comminution will
      accelerate the drying of process materials. A drying process
      within a APT may require a flow of dry and/or heated gas through
      the tool. In FIG. 1, a superimposed dry gas flow can be provided
      by pumping the dry gas into resonator 6 via tube 10 and allowing
      the used gas to exit resonator 6 through tube 11. The application
      of microwaves provides another means of applying heat to the
      process materials during processing, wherein the resonator can act
      as a microwave cavity. While RMS resonators provide the advantage
      of a sealed system, they can also operate when opened to the
      external environment as required by the presence of tubes 10 and
      11. The tubes can be provided with appropriate filters to prevent
      any loss of the process materials.<br>
      <br>
      <b>7) Abrasion or "sand blasting"</b><br>
      <br>
      Abrasive particulates can be used within the APT to "sand blast" a
      solid object rigidly fixed within the resonator. Repeated high
      velocity impacts of such abrasive particulates with the surface of
      the solid object will result in the abrasion of the object's
      surface. In this way, highly complex shapes may be processed so as
      to, for example, clean the object of scale, paint, rust, oxides,
      and other undesired surface coatings without exposure of human
      operators to dust and particulates resulting from the abrasion
      process.<br>
      <br>
      <b>8) Chemical processes</b><br>
      <br>
      The process tool of the present invention can also be used to
      drive chemical reactions. RMS resonators can provide extremely
      high dynamic pressures, dynamic temperatures, and kinetic energies
      for use in enhancing chemical reactions.<br>
      <br>
      For example, the process time required for thermally-driven
      chemical reactions will normally include time for heating and
      cooling the reactor. Thermally-driven chemical reactions can be
      controlled in a new way in the APT. The high dynamic temperatures
      generated within a RMS resonator can be used to turn a chemical
      reaction off and on at the acoustic frequency. By varying the
      input power to the resonator the dynamic temperature amplitude can
      be varied, which in turn will change the fraction of the acoustic
      cycle during which the reaction temperature requirement (high or
      low) is met. Thus, by varying the power input to the resonator, a
      nearly instantaneous control over the rate of reaction would be
      provided.<br>
      <br>
      High kinetic energies achieved within an RMS resonator can be used
      to accelerate catalytic reactions, when a catalyst is placed
      within the resonator. A catalyst can be added to the material to
      be processed, formed on the resonator wall, or added as sheets or
      plates oriented in the direction of the oscillating axial flow.<br>
      <br>
      When filled with a liquid, the APT has the flexibility to provide
      cavitation for sono-chemical reactions at ultrasonic frequencies
      or well below the ultrasonic range. In sono-chemistry systems that
      use ultrasonic sources, it is much more difficult to create
      uniform cavitation throughout the reactor's volume and to transfer
      the power needed for commercial practicality. The APT provides a
      means to fill a very large volume of the reactor (i.e. resonator)
      with cavitation and to do so at very high power levels.<br>
      <br>
      Other chemical reactions and process steps that may be achieved
      within an APT include oxidation, reduction, metal coating, metal
      scrubbingor ablation, dissolution of solids into liquids,
      crystallization, polymerization, de-polymerization, separation
      processes such as high-speed pressure swing adsorption, sparging
      (aeration/deaeration), gas/liquid reactions (chlorination), and
      VOC abatement. The application of microwaves provides another
      means of applying heat, or a more complex interaction, during a
      chemical process, wherein the resonator can act as a microwave
      cavity.<br>
      <br>
      The batch and continuous methods described previously can also be
      used for chemical reactions within the APT. Chemical reactions can
      be combined with many of the previously described processing steps
      inside the same APT. In short, the APT provides a single tool, or
      reactor, with which the process engineer can design a wide range
      of processes that may have previously required multiple tools or
      reactors.<br>
      <br>
      <b>8) Separation</b><br>
      <br>
      Stratification by particulate size along the axis of a resonator
      is well known in the field of acoustics. An APT provides a
      practical means for delivering large amounts of power and greatly
      increasing the yield of an acoustic stratification process. This
      particular use of an APT can be applied to the separation of
      gases.<br>
      <br>
      <b>9) Enhancing processing results</b><br>
      <br>
      The degree of axial, streaming, and turbulent velocities can be
      changed by altering the internal surface finish and internal
      geometry of the APT's resonator. As described in U.S. Pat. No.
      5,515,684 the peak axial velocities achieved, for a given pressure
      amplitude, will depend on the resonator's overall shape. Once a
      given shape is chosen, local streaming and turbulent velocities
      can be altered by changing the internal surface finish, or
      roughness, and by inserting targets in the flow stream. Increasing
      the turbulent and streaming velocities can increase the processing
      rate for applications such as mixing, de-agglomeration, drying,
      vaporization, and comminution, and thus can provide a significant
      advantage.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 3 shows example embodiments of targets that can be used to
      increase yield where a resonator 30 has a screen 32 which spans
      the internal volume of resonator 30 in a direction transverse to
      the axial acoustic velocities. The mesh size of screen 32 can be
      chosen so as not to overly impede the axial flow, but to promote
      the early development of turbulence during a given acoustic cycle.
      In this way, both the turbulent duty-cycle, with respect to an
      acoustic cycle, and the turbulent intensity can be increased,
      thereby providing more processing during a single acoustic cycle.
      Multiple transverse screens can be added to further accentuate the
      effect. Surface protrusions 34 provide another style of target to
      increase processing performance, by promoting turbulence. The
      resonator 20 is driven by driver 4 and connected to variable power
      supply 3 as shown in FIG. 1.<br>
      <br>
      The targets described have a two-fold effect First they will
      increase the rate of particle-particle collisions as well as their
      impact velocities and second they can provide increased surface
      area for particle-resonator collisions.<br>
      <br>
      Many other geometrical arrangements to promote turbulence will
      suggest themselves to those skilled in the art and are considered
      to be within the scope of the present invention. It is also
      understood that the addition of targets is a matter of increasing
      yield and efficiency and that a RMS resonator can provide the
      processing features of the present invention without targets.<br>
      <br>
      In general, the location, size, geometry, and quantity of these
      targets, or obstructions, can be modified to optimize the process
      as desired. Other approaches can be used to increase the
      processing rate and to alter the processing characteristics such
      as the particle size distribution for comminution. For example,
      passive media, such as beads of various materials, can be placed
      within the resonator to optimize comminution, mixing, and
      de-agglomeration. Such enhancements are not limited to a batch
      mode system, but can also be applied to a continuous mode system
      described herein.<br>
      <br>
      The APT of FIG. 3 provides outlet tubes 40 and 42 as a means to
      remove processed materials from the tool. For batch operations,
      resonator 30 can be fitted with flanges for direct opening of the
      resonator in order to add and remove process materials.
      Alteratively, materials can be placed within resonator 30 through
      inlet tube 38 and valve 46 and can be removed through either
      outlet tube 42 and valve 44 or through outlet tube 40 and valve
      48. During processing, valves 44, 46 and 48 can be closed to
      provide a sealed processing environment. Removal of processed
      materials through outlet tube 42 can be assisted by "swept air
      cleaning" consisting of an external pressure source connected to
      inlet tube 38 which would create flow through tube 38, into
      resonator 30, and out through tube 42. In this way the processed
      materials would be entrained in the flow and carried out of
      resonator 30.<br>
      <br>
      Another means for discharging the processed materials is to use
      the nonlinearly generated DC pressure created by the standing
      acoustic wave inside the resonator. The graph of FIG. 4
      illustrates the type of DC pressure distribution that would be
      expected within resonator 30. Po represents the at-rest pressure
      within resonator 30 when no standing wave is present. The curve
      PDC shows how the local at-rest pressure PO is altered in the
      presence of a high amplitude standing wave. Unlike the at-rest
      pressure PO the altered static pressure PDC is high at the
      resonator's ends and lowest at the center of the resonator.<br>
      <br>
      If valves 46 and 48 are opened at the same time, then the DC
      pressure will discharge gas through tube 40 and draw gas in
      through tube 38. The resulting flow will entrain the processed
      materials and discharge them from resonator 30, thus eliminating
      the need for an external pressure source for sweeping the
      resonator. Any RMS resonator can provide DC pressure and need not
      have the specific shape shown in FIG. 3. The placement of inlet
      tube 38 and outlet tube 40 provides the greatest DC pumping
      pressure, as illustrated in FIG. 4. However, DC pressure pumping
      can occur with inlets and outlets being located anywhere along the
      length of resonator as long as there is a DC pressure difference
      between the inlet and outlet positions. Multiple inlets and
      outlets can be used to increase material flow and another outlet
      tube similar to tube 40 could be located at the other end of
      resonator 30.<br>
      <br>
      <b>10) Continuous process</b><br>
      <br>
      In addition to batch processing, the APT of FIG. 3 can also
      operate in a continuous process mode. An external pressure source
      can continuously deliver move process materials through tube 38,
      into resonator 30, and out through tube 42. Process materials can
      also be continuously delivered by allowing the DC pressure to move
      them through tube 38, into resonator 30 where processing occurs,
      and out through tube 40. For both nthe externally-driven and DC
      pressure-driven versions, the flow rate of the gas through the
      chamber 32 can be controlled with the respective valves
      independently from the acoustic processing.<br>
      <br>
      For continuous comminution processes, a classification screen 36
      can be added to the APT of FIG. 3 having a mesh size so as to
      prevent particles from leaving the resonator until they have been
      reduced to the desired size. By locating classification screen 36
      inside resonator 30, a self-cleaning action is provided by the
      oscillating acoustic flow and pressure, thus preventing clogging
      of the screen.<br>
      <br>
      Additional parallel layers of classifying screens can be located
      along the cylindrical axis of resonator 30 having progressively
      smaller mesh sizes from inlet to outlet. In this way, large
      initial particles will not have to travel far along the
      resonator's axis before impacting a screen through which it cannot
      pass until the particle is broken down to a smaller size. Once
      reduced in size, it will experience greater axial accelerations
      and displacements allowing it to hit the next smaller mesh size
      screen. The process continues until the particle can pass through
      the last screen mesh.<br>
      <br>
      It is particularly advantageous to use an APT in continuous mode
      for processes such as therapeutic aerosol generation. Aerosol
      generators or "nebullizers" used for therapeutic purposes often
      utilize high velocity air strews to impart the energy needed to
      create aerosols from liquids. A distribution of droplet sizes is
      thereby created, only a fraction of which are the correct size for
      inhalation. In addition, the high velocity air streams required
      are generally of sufficiently high volumetric flow as to require
      deceleration by externally placed baffles prior to delivery to a
      patient. Because the energy needed to break a liquid into droplets
      is acoustically supplied in an APT, it is possible by varying the
      geometry of the chamber to independently regulate the air flow
      through the resonator at a level required for human inhalation and
      to optimize the air flow velocity so as to entrain only droplets
      of therapeutic size.<br>
      <br>
      <b>11) Process Control</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Every degree of each physical effect created within an RMS
      resonator can be continuously varied by varying the input power to
      the motor driving the resonator. Also, a transition can be made
      from one physical effect to another by varying the power input, as
      in the case of switching from agglomeration to de-agglomeration
      and from stratification to mixing. Acoustic stratification of
      particles by size occurs at lower acoustic amplitudes.<br>
      <br>
      Controls can be provided to select the desired process and adjust
      its rate by varying power input to the motor. Information
      regarding percent completion of a given process can be inferred by
      measured parameters such as power consumption at a reference
      acoustic pressure amplitude and change in resonant frequency. For
      example, at a given dynamic pressure amplitude a batch comminution
      process may require less power as particle sizes are reduced. The
      periodic addition or discharge of process materials, gases,
      liquids, vapors, powders and reactants can be automated by those
      skilled in the art of process control and electromechanical
      design.<br>
      <br>
      There are many ways to exploit the new features of the present
      invention that will readily occur to one skilled in the art of
      process engineering. One of the principal advantages of the APT is
      provided by the wide range of physical effects that can be
      generated within a single chamber. As such, there are innumerable
      ways to combine simultaneous and sequenced processes within a
      single APT, thereby unifying and simplifying formerly complex
      processes. For example, a process requiring comminution of solids,
      mixing the comminuted product with gases and other powders,
      vaporization of liquid reactants, controlling a chemical reaction,
      agglomeration, and discharge of the final product can all be
      performed within a single APT by simply supplying the proper
      materials and controlling the power input to provide the
      respective physical effects. The number of other combinations of
      parallel and sequenced processes that can be realized with an APT
      is virtually endless but is in fact made possible by the unique
      features of the present invention. Thus, the performance of
      multiple complex processes within a single APT is considered to be
      within the scope of the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      As with any process tool, APTs of varying sizes and designs can be
      placed in series and used to process materials in stages.<br>
      <br>
      An APT requires no specific physical orientation to create the
      desired physical effects, and so the designer is free to orient
      the APT in any manner that facilitates a particular design
      requirement, such as a gravity feed of process materials or
      loading and unloading process materials, or controlled entrainment
      of liquid droplets or solid particulates by a gas flowing through
      the unit. A resonator can be removed from its driver and used to
      transport the pressed materials in order to avoid contamination.
      An APT can be operated at extreme temperatures if required by a
      particular process and can be heated or cooled with conventional
      methods, Construction materials can be chosen as appropriate for
      compatibility with given process materials. The number of
      resonator shapes that will provide the physical effects described
      herein is unlimited and the specific shape chosen for a given APT
      design will reflect the given process or processes of interest.<br>
      <br>
      Resonator size should not be considered as a limitation on the
      scope of the invention, since resonators can be scaled to
      extremely small sizes (e.g. micromachines) and to very large sizes
      capable of delivering thousands of watts of processing power.<br>
      <br>
      Further, modes of operation can involve using a fluidized bed
      approach to prevent the process materials from becoming
      acoustically opaque, thereby maximizing the volume of materials
      that can be loaded into a single resonator, while still being able
      to excite the standing wave mode.<br>
      <br>
      APT resonators have no mechanical frictional moving parts and so
      provide great flexibility in materials selection Resonators can be
      constructed from materials that provide long-life,
      non-contamination, and non-reactivity such as stainless steel,
      monel, hastalloy, glass, ceramic or plastic.<br>
      <br>
      Monitoring of APT processes can also be provided by means of
      transparent windows in the resonator. Windows can be used for
      noninvasive optical measurements to determine the degree of

        <b>Standing wave compressor.</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      A compressor for vapor-compression cooling systems, which exploits
      the properties of acoustic resonance in fluids for fluid
      compression, and provides a discharge pressure which can be varied
      during operation in response to changing operating conditions,
      thereby providing an oil-less compressor and reducing the
      compressor's energy consumption. The thermoacoustic properties of
      standing acoustic waves are exploited to provide a refrigerant
      subcooling system which is contained within the compressor.
      Refrigerant subcooling occurs when heat exchange is provided
      between the refrigerant and a heat pumping surface, which is
      exposed to the standing acoustic wave within the compressor.
      Acoustic energy can be provided by either a mechanical driver, or
      by direct exposure of the fluid to microwave and infrared energy,
      including solar energy. Inlets (4) and outlets (6) arranged along
      the chamber (2) provide for the intake and discharge of a fluid
      refrigerant, and can be provided with optional reed valve
      arrangements, so as to increase the compressor's compression
      ratio. The performance of the compressor can be optimised by a
      control circuit which holds the wavelength of the standing wave
      constant, by varying the driving frequency in response to changing
      operating conditions. <br>

        <b>High stability dynamic force motor</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Motor control of a variable reluctance motor is obtained by
      providing a periodic voltage waveform to a coil of a motor. No
      coil current control or current or flux feedback is needed to
      obtain flux waveforms that allow for low-distortion or
      distortion-free operation of the motor. The periodic voltage
      waveform may be a sinusoidal or sawtooth signal, for example, and
      has a substantially zero mean for each cycle of the signal. The
      periodic voltage waveform may be offset to compensate for the
      resistance of the coil, and the coil current may be monitored in
      order to determine the amount of offset required. By providing a
      zero-mean or substantially zero-mean periodic voltage waveform,
      the coil current and flux in the gap between the core and the
      moving part are guaranteed to reach a zero value at some point
      during each period (or cycle) of the periodic voltage waveform.<br>

        <b>Compression-evaporation cooling system having standing wave
          compressor</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      A compressor for compression-evaporation cooling systems, which
      requires no moving parts. A gaseous refrigerant inside a chamber
      is acoustically compressed and conveyed by means of a standing
      acoustic wave which is set up in the gaseous refrigerant. This
      standing acoustic wave can be driven either by a transducer, or by
      direct exposure of the gas to microwave and infrared sources,
      including solar energy. Input and output ports arranged along the
      chamber provide for the intake and discharge of the gaseous
      refrigerant. These ports can be provided with optional valve
      arrangements, so as to increase the compressor's pressure
      differential. The performance of the compressor in either of its
      transducer or electromagnetically driven configurations, can be
      optimized by a controlling circuit. This controlling circuit holds
      the wavelength of the standing acoustical wave constant, by
      changing the driving frequency in response to varying operating
      conditions.<br>

      <br>
      An energy conversion device comprises an acoustic resonator (2), a
      pulse combustion device for creating a standing wave within said
      resonator, and an electric (16) alternator. The alternator (16) is
      coupled to the resonator (2) to convert acoustically driven
      mechanical vibrations into electrical power.<br>

      <br>
      An acoustic resonator includes a chamber containing a fluid. The
      chamber has anharmonic resonant modes and provides boundary
      conditions which predetermine the harmonic phases and amplitudes
      needed to synthesize a non-sinusoidal, unshocked waveform.<br>
