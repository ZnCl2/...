        <img alt="" src="bobkurko.jpg" height="158" width="210"><br>

      <br>
      A southern Oregon inventor claims he has developed a way to not
      only save you money at the pump but also reduce air pollution.<br>
      <br>
      "We've come up with a solution to get all of the fuel to burn
      efficiently," said the inventor, Bob Kurko. "If you get all of the
      fuel burning, you're not going to have emissions."<br>
      <br>
      Kurko, pictured below, said he invented E3 ultra clean fuel
      catalyst in his garage in Cave Junction.<br>
      <br>
      He said it changes the way gasoline is used in the engine, making
      it burn 100 percent efficiently.<br>
      <br>
      Kurko said your car would actually act as an air cleaner. When the
      air from the outside is pulled in through the air intake system,
      through the filter and then mixed in the engine with the gasoline
      and the fuel catalyst, what's burned and comes out of your tail
      pipe is actually cleaner than the air that went in to your engine.<br>
      <br>
      Lt. Col. James Boozell said he is a believer.<br>
      <br>
      "If every car in the country were driving on this, global warming
      would be eliminated," said Boozell, who is a Department of Defense
      employee at the Pentagon while moonlighting as a spokesman for
      Kurko's E3 fuel catalyst.<br>
      <br>
      He said he has to fight his own bosses and oil companies to make
      them listen.<br>
      <br>
      "Unless they are directed to use the product, they are not going
      to voluntarily use the product … so it may take some sort of
      directive for all of our fuel companies and our large government
      agencies to come on board," said Boozell, pictured at right.<br>
      <br>
      He said he became a believer when he ran the product in diesel
      engines at the South Carolina National Guard.<br>
      <br>
      Some of the vehicles - including Hummers and large two-and-a-half
      ton trucks - saw fuel efficiency increase 45 percent and emissions
      drop 98 percent, Boozell said.<br>
      <br>
      KATU reporter Thom Jensen tested the catalyst in his own car.<br>
      <br>
      First he ran his family's sport utility vehicle on regular
      gasoline. After burning through a tank of fuel, his vehicle's
      onboard computer showed an average gas mileage of 18.2 mpg.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Then he filled up again and added a quart of the E3 catalyst and
      ran the SUV under his usual driving conditions. The computer
      showed he was getting almost 22 mpg.<br>
      <br>
      This was far from a scientific test – such a lab test would cost
      hundreds of thousands of dollars.<br>
      <br>
      So we asked Portland State University chemistry professor Shankar
      Rananavare what he thought about our results.<br>
      <br>
      He said the gas mileage probably comes from a cleaner burning
      engine. Rananavare said the fuel catalyst may really be a fuel
      system cleaner.<br>
      <br>
      "There's nothing inherit in that material that gives you extra
      energy," the professor said.<br>
      <br>
      His preliminary conclusion, he said, is only based on KATU's
      description of the product. The actual materials used in the
      catalyst have not been made public.<br>
      <br>
      Rananavare said he wants to see more tests done in lab conditions
      with new car engines burning the same brand of fuel.<br>
      <br>
      He said tests should be done repeatedly with results that are also
      repeated before you can truly say the catalyst works.<br>
      <br>
      We also put Kurko's emissions claims to the test.<br>
      <br>
      The reporter tested his 2004 Volvo at Morgan Automotive in
      southeast Portland on a four-gas analyzer.<br>
      <br>
      It ran super clean before the additive, with hydrocarbons at just
      8 ppm (parts per million) and carbon monoxide at zero – which is
      clean enough to pass the strictest emissions requirements in the
      U.S.<br>
      <br>
      With the fuel additive, there were no hydrocarbons (pictured at
      right), which is not unheard of but not seen often, according to
      those at the shop.<br>
      <br>
      Kurko said that so far government agencies and oil companies in
      the U.S. have had the same response to his invention.<br>
      <br>
      "They laugh at us," he said.<br>
      <br>
      As gas prices soar, though, Kurko said the laughing is beginning
      to stop and suitors are lining up, mostly in other countries.<br>
      <br>
      "I'm gonna go where they want it, so if they don't want it here in
      America that's fine," Kurko said. "We'll go other places."<br>

      <br>
      This application claims benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent

      <br>
      <b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      The present disclosure relates to catalysts for use as additives
      to fossil fuels. More particularly, the present disclosure relates
      to fuel additives that will substantially eliminate harmful
      greenhouse gas emissions while providing an increase in fuel
      efficiency during fossil fuel combustion.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Over the last century, the widespread use of liquid fossil fuels
      as resulted in substantial industrial progress. Notwithstanding
      current efforts to conserve the world's petroleum resources and to
      use alternative energy sources such as coal, nuclear, solar,
      geothermal, and the like, fuel obtained from oil remains our main
      energy source for everything from vehicles and home heating plants
      to our largest industrial facilities.<br>
      <br>
      As its use has increased, fossil fuels such as oil, has been the
      source of much industrial and urban pollution. For example, during
      combustion, incomplete combustion of the fuel produces toxic
      carbon monoxide and other harmful emissions. The electric spark
      and high temperatures also allow oxygen and nitrogen to react and
      form nitrogen monoxide and nitrogen dioxide, which are responsible
      for photochemical smog and acid rain. Furthermore, though once
      very abundant and inexpensive, oil has recently become a very
      expensive commodity and, because it is a non-renewable resource,
      oil will become ever more scarce in the future. Our use of it is
      so universal that even the most optimistic predictions of
      achieving transition to alternatives forecast many years of high
      consumption.<br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, efforts have been directed to improving the
      performance of machinery using fossil fuels or liquid hydrocarbon
      fuels, for example, by increasing the miles per gallon of
      automobiles. In part this has involved redesign of the machinery
      which uses the fuel. Another tactic has been to change the
      combustion characteristics of the fuel itself by refining and by
      the use of additives. Although there have been substantial efforts
      made to improve hydrocarbon fuels by supplementing them with
      various additives, these efforts have not enjoyed widespread
      acceptance or much success because of one shortcoming or another.
      Accordingly, there has long been, and still remains, a need for an
      inexpensive yet effective additive for liquid fossil fuels to
      provide cleaner combustion and fuel improve efficiency. It would
      be desirable to utilize fuel additive that, when added to fossil
      fuels, uses less fuel, produces reduced emissions while
      maintaining the same BTU output during combustion. It is a primary
      object of my invention to provide such a fuel additive.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      An additive composition for use in a liquid fuel containing a
      mixture of alcohol, aromatic hydrocarbon, acetone, petroleum
      ether, and mineral oil. The fuel additive is added to a
      hydrocarbon fuel to reduce pollutants and improve burning
      efficiency of the fuel. The treated fuel is produced by mixing a
      sufficient amount of additive to the fuel to produce the desired
      result.<br>
      <br>
      <b>DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      I have developed a new additive composition, used to treat liquid
      fuels, comprising various mixtures of ingredients. One ingredient
      is alcohol. Preferably I use a low molecular weight alcohol, that
      is, an alcohol having four or fewer carbon atoms. Such alcohols
      include methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, butanol, and
      mixtures thereof. The alcohol will comprise, on a volume/volume
      basis at ambient temperature, about 62 to about 82 percent of the
      additive, preferably about 70 to about 75 percent. For additives
      for gasoline, I typically use ethanol and for gasohol I prefer
      isopropanol.<br>
      <br>
      A second ingredient of the additive is an aromatic hydrocarbon.
      Preferably I use benzene or a benzene derivative such as toluene,
      xylene, naphthalene, biphenyl and mixtures thereof. The aromatic
      hydrocarbon will comprise, on a volume/volume basis at ambient
      temperature, about 5 to about 15 percent of the additive,
      preferably about 8 to about 10 percent.<br>
      <br>
      A third ingredient of the additive is acetone which is an organic
      compound with the formula OC(CH3)2 also known as dimethyl ketone,
      DMK, or propanone. The acetone will comprise, on a volume/volume
      basis at ambient temperature, about 5 to about 15 percent of the
      additive, preferably about 8 to about 10 percent.<br>
      <br>
      A fourth ingredient of the additive is petroleum either that
      includes a group of various volatile, liquid hydrocarbon mixtures
      of non-polar solvents known as benzine, VM&amp;P Naphtha, Naphtha
      ASTM, Petroleum Spirits, X4, or Ligroin. The petroleum ether will
      comprise, on a volume/volume basis at ambient temperature, about 5
      to about 20 percent of the additive, preferably about 7 to about
      12 percent.<br>
      <br>
      A fifth ingredient of the additive is mineral oil or liquid
      petroleum is a by-product in the distillation of petroleum to
      produce gasoline another petroleum based products from crude oil.
      It is composed mainly of alkanes, typically 15 to 40 carbons, and
      cyclic paraffin, related to white petroleum. The mineral oil will
      comprise, on a volume/volume basis at ambient temperature, about
      at least 0.00001 percent of the additive, preferably about at
      least 0.000015 percent.<br>
      <br>
      In practice to treat the desired fuel, I first blend the
      ingredients in for example a 55 gallon drum at room temperature to
      produce an additive according to my invention. I then introduce,
      by splash blending for example, the additive in sufficient
      quantities to the fuel to improve the efficiency with which the
      fuel burns or operates in an engine or its other operating
      characteristics. The amount which will provide optimum results can
      vary depending upon the type and quality of the fuel, engine or
      burner design and the like.<br>
      <br>
      Regarding specific fuels to be treated, I have found, for example,
      that by mixing my fuel additive to gasoline or gasohol fuel in a
      ratio of about 0.25 to about 4.0 ounces of additive to about one
      gallon of fuel produces superior results. For diesel fuel for use
      with cars, trucks, trains, marine and small engines, and the like,
      I prefer to use a ratio of about 1.0 to about 5.0 ounces of
      additive to about one gallon of fuel. For diesel fuels such as
      heating oil or as smudge pot fuel, I have found that I obtain
      better results by using a ratio of about 0.25 to about 3.0 gallons
      of additive to about 32 gallons of fuel.<br>
      <br>
      For bunker fuels, before introducing my additive, I generally
      preheat the bunker fuel above ambient temperature, typically using
      higher temperatures for heavier bunker fuels to provide ease of
      blending in the additive. Typical bunker fuels include, without
      limitation, #2, #4, #6, and #8 bunker fuels used in marine and
      industrial boilers. Depending on the type of bunker fuel, I
      typically use a ratio of about 0.25 to about 3.0 gallons of
      additive to about 30 to 40 gallons of bunker fuel.<br>
      <br>
      For recycled fuel oil used in place of diesel in industrial boiler
      for example, before introducing my additive, I generally first
      clean the fuel by standard methods including centrifuging or
      passing it through a filter. I then heat the cleaned fuel above
      ambient temperature to facilitate ease of blending with the
      additive. I prefer to use a ratio of about 0.25 to about 3.0
      gallons of additive to about 40 gallon of recycled fuel oil.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLES</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Having described my invention, I now provide the following
      examples to illustrate specific applications of my invention,
      including the best mode now known to perform the invention. I do
      not intend for these examples to limit the scope of my invention
      as I have described in this application.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 1</b><b><br>
      </b><b>Treatment of Gasoline</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Additive Formulation #1 is provided for treatment of gasoline
      (without ethanol added to the fuel) for use with cars, trucks,
      recreation vehicles and small engines that burn gasoline. Into a
      standard 55 gallon drum at ambient temperature, was blended 40.15
      liquid gallons or 73% of total volume of 55 gallon container of
      tech grade ethyl alcohol C2H5OH., 4.95 liquid gallons or 9% of
      total volume of 55 gallon container of tech grade Acetone
      OC(CH3)2, 4.95 liquid gallons or 9% of total volume of 55 gallon
      container of tech grade Xylene C8H10, 4.95 liquid gallons or 9% of
      total volume of 55 gallon container of tech grade VM&amp;P
      Naphtha, composition of C8 C9, 5 liquid milliliters or 0.000024%
      of total volume of 55 gallon container of Hydro treated Distillate
      light Naphthenic Oil. The components are blended through splash
      blending.<br>
      <br>
      Additive Formulation #1 is then introduced into the gasoline at
      ambient temperature blending one ounce of the additive to one
      gallon of gasoline fuel by splash blending.<br>
      <br>
      The resulting treated gasoline was then tested for physical
      properties in a 2002 Acura MDX, with a 3.5 L. V. Tech. engine
      using regular gas having the additive. Prior to commencing the
      test on Apr. 23, 2007 the vehicle had 47,228 miles and was
      averaging 19.63 miles per gallon and the emissions at idle were HC
      24 PPM, CO2 15.5%, CO 0.01%, O2 0.0% and NOx 2 PPM. The time frame
      for the test was four months using Formulation #1 each day and the
      results were recorded periodically.<br>
      <br>
      The driving conditions during the approximate four month test
      period with 4062 miles driven were substantially the same as the
      conditions prior thereto. The emission tests were conducted with a
      Ferret Gas link II, and a Snap-on 5 gas emissions analyzer. Both
      analyzers were calibrated by a certified mechanic.<br>
      <br>
      During the test period the MPG increased to an average of 23.12
      from 19.63 or an increase of 3.49 MPG or 17.8%. The emissions at
      idle decreased to HC 0 PPM or 100%, CO2 14.4% or 7.09% decrease,
      CO 0.01% to 0.0% or 100% decrease, O2 0.0% to 0.13% or an increase
      of 0.13 from a base of zero, and NOx 2 PPM to 0 PPM, a 100%
      decrease. The emissions at 2500 RPM's decreased from 101 PPM HC to
      3 PPM HC or 97% decrease, CO2 from 15.6% to 14.5% or a 7%
      decrease, CO 0.01% to 0.0% or 100% decrease, O2 0.0% to 0.18% or
      an increase of 0.18 from a base of zero, and NOx 101 PPM to 58
      PPM, a 42% decrease.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 2</b><b><br>
      </b><b>Treatment of Gasohol</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Additive Formulation #2 is provided for treatment of gasoline with
      ethanol fuel (sometimes referred to as “gasohol”) for use with
      cars, trucks, recreation vehicles and small engines that burn
      gasoline. Into a standard 55 gallon drum at ambient temperature,
      was blended 40.15 liquid gallons or 73% of total volume of 55
      gallon container of tech grade Isopropyl alcohol C3H7OH, 4.95
      liquid gallons or 9% of total volume of 55 gallon container of
      tech grade Acetone OC(CH3)2, 4.95 liquid gallons or 9% of total
      volume of 55 gallon container of tech grade Xylene C8H10, 4.95
      liquid gallons or 9% of total volume of 55 gallon container of
      tech grade VM&amp;P Naphtha, composition of C8 C9, 5 liquid
      milliliters or 0.000024% of total volume of 55 gallon container of
      Hydro treated Distillate light Naphthenic Oil. The components are
      blended through splash blending.<br>
      <br>
      Formulation #2 is introduced to the gasohol at ambient temperature
      blending one ounce of additive to one gallon of gasoline fuel by
      splash blending. The resulting treated gasohol was then tested for
      physical properties in a 2002 Acura MDX, with a 3.5 L. V. Tech.
      engine using regular gas having the additive. Prior to commencing
      the test on Aug. 25, 2007, the vehicle had 52,411 miles and was
      averaging 19.63 miles per gallon and the emissions at idle were HC
      24 PPM, CO2 15.5%, CO 0.01%, O2 0.0% and NOx 2 PPM. The time frame
      for the test was three months using the fuel catalyst each day and
      recording the results periodically.<br>
      <br>
      The driving conditions during the approximate three month test
      period with 6326 miles driven were substantially the same as the
      conditions prior thereto. Formulation #2 was used each day and the
      results were recorded periodically. The emission tests were
      conducted with a Ferret Gas link II, and a Snap-on 5 gas emissions
      analyzer, both analyzers were calibrated by a certified mechanic.<br>
      <br>
      During the test period the MPG increased an average of 1.58 from a
      base average of 19.63, an increase of 1.58 MPG or 8.03%. The
      emissions at idle decreased to HC 0 PPM or 100%, CO2 from 15.5% to
      13.6% or 13.8% decrease, CO 0.01% to 0.0% or 100% decrease, O2
      0.0% to 0.2% or an increase of 0.2 from a base of zero, and NOx 2
      PPM to 17 PPM, an increase of 15 PPM. The emissions at 2500 RPM's

      15.6% to 14.5% or a 7% decrease, CO 0.01% to 0.0% or 100%
      decrease, O2 0.0% to 0.1% or an increase of 0.1 from a base of

      <b>Example 3</b><b><br>
      </b><b>Treatment of #2 Diesel Fuel</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Additive Formulation #2 was prepared as described in Example 2 for
      use with cars, trucks, trains, marine, and small engines that burn
      #2 diesel. Formulation #2 is introduced to the #2 diesel at
      ambient temperature blending three ounces of Formulation #2 to one
      gallon of #2 diesel fuel by splash blending.<br>
      <br>
      The resulting treated #2 diesel fuel was then tested for physical
      properties in a 2000 Argosy Freightliner, with a diesel
      Caterpillar C12 410 HP motor with a five inch stack that powered
      the tractor unit on the Semi Truck. Prior to commencing the test
      on Aug. 10, 2008 the vehicle had over 500,000 miles on the chasse
      with a rebuilt engine. The truck was averaging 5.81 miles per
      gallon and the emissions without treatment averaged 49.25%. The
      time frame for the test was four months using the fuel catalyst
      each day and the results were recorded periodically.<br>
      <br>
      The driving conditions during the four month test period with over
      25,000 miles driven were substantially the same as the conditions
      prior thereto. We used a Wagner digital smoke meter model 6500 and
      preformed (4) snap tests on the unit with the Formulation #2 and
      (2) two snap tests without treatment. The snap test consists of
      three max revs of the engine and an average is taken of the three
      snaps for one opacity percentage. The opacity meter reads the
      maximum smoke density from revving the engine or (snap).<br>
      <br>
      During the test period the MPG increased to an average of 7.29 MPG
      from 5.81 MPG. This was a 1.31 MPG increase or 20.37%. The density
      of the emissions from opacity tests of the smoke decreased
      substantially using Formulation #2 from an average 49.25% without
      treatment to 2.95% using Formulation #2.<br>

      <div align="left"><b>Example 4</b><b><br>
        </b><b>Treatment of Heating Oil</b><b><br>
        </b></div>
      <br>
      Additive Formulation #2 was prepared as described in Example 2 for
      use with use with #2 diesel fuel for use as heating oil in “smudge
      pots” for orchard heating that burn #2 diesel. Formulation #2 is
      introduced to the #2 diesel at ambient temperature blending one
      quart of the Formulation #2 to eight gallons of #2 diesel fuel by
      splash blending.<br>
      <br>
      The resulting treated heating oil was then tested for physical
      properties in two separate tests. The tests were with Myers
      Orchard, Talent Oregon and Harry and David Orchards, Medford
      Oregon. The test with Myers was conducted two times for visible
      particulate smoke, during the winter and spring of 2008. This same
      time period, Mr. Myers tested the product for fuel efficiency when
      he used the fuel catalyst in #2 Diesel to heat his orchard. Both
      tests also used identical smudge pots of similar condition and
      made by same manufacturer. The test with Harry and David during
      the winter and spring of 2008, testing the product for emissions
      and particulates left on leaves after using the smudge pots for
      heating. Harry and David to certify their fruit as organic needed
      a product that would not leave smoke residue from smudging using
      #2 diesel.<br>
      <br>
      During the test period, Mr. Myers stated that using the
      Formulation #2 in #2 diesel gave him cost savings from efficiency
      gains in extending burn time of the fuel. The two tests for
      visible smoke particulates show little or no visible particulates
      using the fuel catalyst compared to very dense, thick smoke in #2
      diesel without the fuel catalyst. Local Medford Oregon TV station
      channel 5 News did a report on the results verifying no visible
      smoke emissions from #2 diesel treated with Formulation #2. Harry
      and David used cotton swabs to swab buds and leaves of fruit trees
      during the test period and reported no particulate residue on
      swabbed tree growth after smudging using Formulation #2. Without
      treatment, Harry and David reported particulate residue that would
      have disqualified them from certifying their fruit organic
      smudging with #2 diesel without treatment.<br>

      <div align="left"><b>Example 4</b><br>
        <b>Treatment of Bunker Fuel</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Additive Formulation #2 was prepared as described in Example 2 for
      use with use with #2 diesel fuel for use with #2, #4, #6, #8
      bunker fuels for use in marine and industrial use boilers.
      Formulation #2 at ambient temperature is introduced into the #2
      bunker fuel heated to 110 degrees Fahrenheit, blending one gallon
      of the Formulation #2 to forty gallons of #2 Bunker fuel by splash
      blending. Formulation #2 at ambient temperature is introduced into
      the #4 bunker fuel heated to 125 degrees Fahrenheit, blending one
      gallon of the Formulation #2 to thirty five gallons of #4 Bunker
      fuel by splash blending. Formulation #2 at ambient temperature is
      introduced into the #6 bunker fuel heated to 145 degrees
      Fahrenheit, blending one gallon of the Formulation #2 to thirty
      gallon of #6 bunker fuel by splash blending. Formulation #2 at
      ambient temperature is introduced into the #8 bunker fuel heated
      to 160 degrees Fahrenheit, blending one gallon of Formulation #2
      to thirty gallons of #8 bunker fuel by splash blending.<br>
      <br>
      Bunker fuels treated with Formulation 32 have not been tested. The
      densities of bunker fuels are similar to the Recycled Fuel Oil
      (“RFO”) that has been tested. I believe therefore that the bunker
      fuels will have similar results as the RFO tests. RFO was tested
      for physical properties in two 350,000 BTU Boilers at a RFO plant.
      The time frame for the test was four months using the fuel
      catalyst each day and recording the results periodically. The test
      period began April of 2008 and continued through July 2008. The
      time frame for the test was four months using the Formulation #2
      each day and recording the results periodically.<br>
      <br>
      During the test period the volume of fuel used in a twelve hour
      period of burn time was reduced from approximately 125 gallons to
      85 gallons, a reduction of 32%. The boiler operators reported
      better ignition starts, no ignition failures, a hotter burn with
      less ash and a cleaner burn. The maintenance time was extended
      from 400 hours to 575 hours with no carbon buildup in stack or
      ignition system or nozzles, reducing maintenance costs.<br>

      <div align="left"><b>Example 5</b><br>
        <b>Treatment of Recycled Fuel Oil</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Additive Formulation #2 was prepared as described in Example 2 for
      use with Recycled Fuel Oil (RFO), for use in place of #2 diesel
      fuel and in industrial use boilers. This is a process that first
      takes RFO and cleans the oil by use of a two micron filter or
      centrifuge. The cleaned RFO is then heated to 140 degrees
      Fahrenheit and is blended with the fuel catalyst. Formulation #2
      at ambient temperature is splash blended using one gallon of
      Formulation #2 to forty gallons of the heated RFO. The treated RFO
      makes an economical, ultra clean fuel with significant higher
      BTU's which is used in boiler applications and substitutions for
      #2 diesel fuels.<br>
      <br>
      The resulting treated RFO was then tested for physical properties
      in two 350,000 BTU Boilers at a RFO plant. The time frame for the
      test was four months using the fuel catalyst each day and
