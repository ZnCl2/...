        <p><b><font size="+1">The Electrical Production of Synthetic
              Gasoline</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>The world needs gasoline --- thousands of internal combustion
        engines are daily consuming untold gallons of the valuable fuel
        and have sent the price skyward at a rate that would give the
        average motorist heart failure. And just at the time that the
        situation promised to become acute an inventor comes forward
        with an electrical method of producing ir from kerosene, solar
        oil and low-grade distillates. </p>
      <p>Briefly the process is as follows: Take some kerosene, vaporize
        it, mix in a little natural gas and shoot a bolt of electricity
        through it. Wash it with acid, soda ash and water, then distill
        and you have pure, water white gasoline that will clean kid
        gloves or drive a motor car. Simple, isn’t it? </p>
      <p>But it took two years of experimental work to bring the process
        to its present practical condition. One of the illustrations
        herewith show Mr Louis B Cheery, the inventor of the process,
        and the first plant that proved his ideas practical. </p>
      <p>In order to understand the working of the Cherry process for
        producing gasoline it would not be out of place to describe
        briefly the usual process of distillation of crude oil. Then a
        better idea will be gained of how the new process can be readily
        adopted to the present refineries. </p>
      <p>The oil as it comes from the well is black in color, having a
        disagreeable odor and quite thick. In this form it is known as
        crude oil and, depending on the part of the country from which
        it comes, will have very little gasoline, or possibly as high as
        15 to 30 percent of gasoline, in it. </p>
      <p>The oil is pumped into a large still which may hold from 5 to
        1500 barrels. This still is usually of cylindrical form and is
        mounted on brickwork similar to a horizontal steam boiler. Fire
        is placed under the still and the temperature of the oil
        gradually raised. When it reaches a temperature of 90 to 100
        degrees F, gases will pass over into a condenser which consists
        of a large coiled pipe immersed in a tank of water. These vapors
        condense and thus is obtained high-proof gasoline or petroleum
        ether. </p>
      <p>The temperature is further raised until all the gasoline vapor
        passes over. The end point or the maximum temperature at which
        gases are allowed to pass over is 400 F. This fraction or cut is
        known as crude benzene by the refiners and is then treated with
        sulfuric acid, soda ash, washed with water and redistilled. This
        results in commercial gasoline used for motor cars. </p>
      <p>The above process takes out all the gasoline, further heating
        causes kerosene, solar oil and heavy lubricating oils to pass
        over and condense in turn. This operation is known as fractional
        distillation, the residue remaining in the still after a high
        temperature is reached being coal tar, which is the source of
        our dyes and other products. </p>
      <p>Now turning to the Cherry process. It is a well-k known fact
        that all crude oil products from gasoline to paraffin wax are
        hydrocarbons --- that is, they consist of varying mixtures of
        hydrogen and carbon. It is apparent that were some means found
        for controlling the relative proportions of the hydrogen and
        carbon it would be possible to produce any of the various
        products at will; that is, obtain all paraffin or all gasoline,
        as desired. By studying the constituents of the various
        hydrocarbons, Mr Cherry noted that if natural gas could be
        combined chemically in proper proportions with the various
        distillates, he would then have gasoline. Acting on this he
        discovered that a high-tension electric current would affect the
        necessary reaction and produce gasoline. </p>
      <p>In practice, the still used is similar to that employed in
        refining crude oil, but has a perforated pipe at the bottom. The
        kerosene or other low-grade oil is placed in this still and
        while being heated natural gas is forced into the perforated
        pipe and escaping up through the liquid is heated to the same
        temperature and thoroughly mixed with the oil vapor. This vapor
        then passes into a series of electrically heated pipes that have
        a central electrode, this electrode as well as the pipes being
        connected to a source of high-tension current [100,000 V ] of
        extremely high frequency. </p>
      <p>The gases are subjected to this silent discharge as they flow
        though the pipes and their chemical structure is so altered that
        the resulting condensate is a crude benzene. For the proper
        results it is necessary that the temperature of the gases, their
        rate of flow, as well as the voltage and frequency of the
        current be properly adjusted. On treated the benzene so obtained
        a liquid results that cannot be detected from gasoline --- in
        fact, it is gasoline! </p>
      <p>To produce 60,000 gallons of gasoline by the above process
        daily, an electrical equipment rated at 75 KW is required. The
        illustrations give a good idea of the apparatus employed in a
        plant of the above size. The general view of the high-tension
        gallery shows the transformer in the background, with the
        condenser used in the closed oscillator circuit at the left.
        Another illustration shows the rotary spark gap having two large
        rotating disks fitted with plugs to obtain a high rate of
        discharge through the closed circuit, the primary of the
        oscillatory transformer being shown at the left. </p>
      <p>The treating chambers are shown in another illustration in
        which the mixed vapors are treated. The large porcelain
        insulators can be clearly seen that insulate the central
        electrodes. The pipes are also wound with electric heating
        coiuls to obtain the proper temperature. </p>
      <p>The entire operation taking place at atmospheric pressure, it
        is a simple matter to fit the ordinary crude oil still with the
        necessary treating chambers and electrical equipment. Tests tend
        to prove that the cost of treating one gallon of kerosene does
        not exceed one cent, while the value of the process will be
        better appreciated when it is stated that it is practical to
        convert nearly all the volatile oils into gasoline without undue
        precipitation of carbon or the production of fixed gases. </p>
      <p>At a recent test it was possible to change 76.68 per cent of
        the kerosene used into pure gasoline, but the plant under
        construction is expected to raise the percentage to 98 or 100.
        Mr Cherry has offered to furnish the government all the gasoline
        it requires for a flat rate of 10 cents per gallon, and to say
        the least this offer has caused quite a commotion among those
        interested in gasoline production. </p>
      <p>Is this but another step along the road to the production of
        gold from the baser metals? According to the more recent
        theories of the electrical nature of matter it should be
        possible to affect such a change by electrical means. Al matter
        being made up of electrical charges, it merely remains for some
        one to find a way of controlling the grouping of these charges
        and they can instantly produce anything from the material at
        hand. </p>
      <p>The kerosene vapor with which has been mixed natural gas,
        enters at A and passes into pipe B. The latter is of iron
        covered with a layer of electrical insulation, such as mica,
        shown at F, over which is wound the resistance wires G, for
        heating the chamber. These wires are in turn covered by a thick
        layer of heat insulating material to retain the heat and keep
        the temperature constant. </p>
      <p>The electrode D is mounted centrally in the chamber, being
        supported and insulate by the porcelain E. At J is shown the
        terminals of the heating winding. </p>
      <p>The sectional view also shows the wiring to produce the high
        tension high frequency currents required to treat the vapors. AN
        alternating current supply is connected to the primary of the
        step-up transformer T, through a choke coil CC. A condenser C is
        shunted across the secondary of the transformer, while a rotary
        spark gap R serves to discharge the condenser periodically
        through the primary of the oscillation transformer OT. In this
        manner high frequency currents are induced in the secondary of
        the oscillation transformer, which flow to the rods D,
        connection beig made from the other terminal to the pipes as
        shown at I. </p>
      <p>The heating coils are connected to the current supply through
        an adjustable resistance not shown in the drawing. </p>
