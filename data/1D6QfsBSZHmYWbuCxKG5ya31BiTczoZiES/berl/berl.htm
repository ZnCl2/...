        <p align="left">Growing our own gas may be the answer to the
          problems posed by the demands of war and increasing industrial
          and personal needs. Startling results have been achieved by
          Dr. E. Berl, a research professor at the Carnegie Institute of
          Technology, from his experiments in converting plants into
          gasoline, coal, and other hydrocarbons. By carefully
          controlled internal combustion, plant material such as sugar
          cane, wood, sorghum, potatoes, cornstalks, or even grass, is
          transformed into a substance known as ‘protoproduct’. </p>
        <p align="left">A gummy semiliquid at ordinary temperatures,
          this protoproduct is itself a highly efficient fuel.
          Hydrogenation converts it in turn into gasoline, kerosene, or
          lubricating oil. Or by another process it can be changed into
          coal that is said to be in some respects superior to natural
          coal. If Dr Berl’s method proves practical on a commercial
          scale, it may be of world-changing importance, for vast
          agricultural areas might easily produce their own fuel for
          industrial power. </p>

        <p align="left">To the American Chemical Society convened in
          Detroit last week, Professor Ernst Berl of Pittsburgh's
          Carnegie Institute for Technology made an astonishing
          announcement. He said he had made, experimentally but
          successfully, oil, coal, coke and asphalt from grass, leaves,
          seaweed, sawdust, scrap lumber, corn, cornstalks, cotton. </p>
        <p align="left">The earth's supplies of coal and oil were laid
          in, once for all, during the Carboniferous Age, 200 to 300
          million years ago. Using them is like spending capital. But
          using coal and oil made from plants would be like spending
          income, since plants grow prodigally and all the time. </p>
        <p align="left">One difference between wood and oil is that wood
          is mostly carbohydrates (composed of carbon, hydrogen and
          oxygen) whereas oil is mostly hydrocarbons (composed of carbon
          and hydrogen only). Chemically these two great classes of
          compounds behave very differently. But economically the really
          important difference between wood and oil is that wood-burning
          locomotives are obsolete, whereas oil-burning Diesel trains
          are the height of modernity. </p>
        <p align="left">Apparently, converting the carbohydrate
          vegetable matter into hydrocarbons is the most ticklish part
          of Dr. Berl's process, and he did not talk about it too
          freely. He heats the carbohydrate under pressure with
          limestone and "similar substances." Probably one or more
          catalysts (chemical activators) are involved. The time
          required is only one hour --- considerably less than the
          millions of years that nature needed. The <i>New York Herald
            Tribune</i> gulped with excitement: "What the Wrights did to
          distance, he [Professor Berl] has done to geologic time. One's
          imagination gags at the possibilities." </p>
        <p align="left">Dr. Berl did not say how much or what fuel would
          be needed to run his fuel factory (if coal or oil were used,
          the amount consumed would certainly have to be less than the
          amount manufactured). He did say that, with natural coal and
          oil still plentiful and prices low, the cost would be too high
          to undertake commercially now. But he believes the chemist's
          job is to be ready for future shortages. </p>

        <p align="left">Ernst Berl, Walter G. Berl, executor of said
          Ernst Berl, deceased. </p>
        <p align="left">This invention relates to the production of
          hydrocarbons from plant material. </p>
        <p align="left">The production of liquid hydrocarbons is now
          carried out on a large scale with lignites and younger
          bituminous coal as the starting materials. In one known
          process, hydrogenation of the older lignites or the younger
          bituminous coal proceeds directly, with or without the
          addition of appropriate catalytic material, whereby through a
          combination of cracking and hydrogenation liquid hydrocarbons
          result, which contain alipathic, hydroaromatic, and aromatic
          hydrocarbons and which, therefore, have a rather high
          anti-knock value. Another known process converts fuels
          directly or indirectly from a mixture or carbon monoxide and
          hydrogen. This water-gas mixture can be converted by means of
          appropriate catalysts into alipathic hydrocarbons, mostly of
          the straight chain character. This process can be carried out
          like the aforementioned process under pressure or without
          pressure. The liquid hydrocarbons obtained exhibit a rather
          low anti-knock value and have to be modified by the formation
          of branched alipathic hydrocarbons possessed of a higher
          anti-knock value. The same process makes possible the
          production of solid paraffins of very high molecular weight. </p>
        <p align="left">Both processes use raw materials prepared by
          nature at former geological periods. In view of the fact that,
          for the production of one part by weight of liquid or solid
          hydrocarbons, about four or five parts in weight of coal are
          necessary, the consumption of those valuable raw materials is
          rather high. </p>
        <p align="left">In a previous publication (Annalen der Chemie,
          Vol. 504, p. 38-71) I disclosed the conversion of pure
          cellulose – in the form of cotton linters – first into a
          protoproduct and then by hydrogenation or by cracking into a
          liquid oil. Prior to the invention to be disclosed herebelow
          it was impossible to convert plant lignin by simple means into
          liquid or semi-liquid materials. Conversion was possible only
          by very expensive processes requiring the use of costly
          apparatus. The process of the publication aforesaid was
          relatively simple insofar as process steps are concerned, but
          was expensive insofar as raw material is concerned. Prior to
          the present invention, I believed, in common with the rest of
          the scientific world, that the only suitable raw material for
          such a process was pure or substantially pure cellulose. All
          scientific experience with the treatment of plant lignin
          indicated that it could not be converted into useful products
          in such a process, because such work as had been done on plant
          lignin had been done after isolation of the lignin by the
          saccharification or other conversion of the carbohydrates, and
          when so treated it had been found, as stated above, that the
          processing gave no practical results. </p>
        <p align="left">It is an object of this invention to provide an
          economical process whereby liquid or semi-liquid fuel and
          other valuable hydrocarbon products can be produced from
          inexpensive plant material. </p>
        <p align="left">Another object of the invention is a process
          whereby hydrocarbon fuel displaying high anti-knock properties
          can be produced from plant material. </p>
        <p align="left">Still another object of the invention is the
          conversion of inexpensive plant material into artificial
          bituminous asphalt as in intermediary product in the
          production of valuable end products. </p>
        <p align="left">Other objects of the invention will become
          readily apparent from the following description. </p>
        <p align="left">In accordance with the present invention, liquid
          hydrocarbons and asphalts, also phenols, can be formed easily
          from carbohydrates and carbohydrate and lignin containing
          materials such as plants, algae, seaweed, grasses, leaves,
          wood, peat, corn stalks, straw, bagasse, molasses or the like.
          The conversion of such material, produced continuously by
          nature on a large scale, can be effected discontinuously or
          continuously by heating the aforementioned raw materials with
          aqueous solutions or suspensions o alkaline reacting
          substances such as lime, magnesia, sodium-, potassium-,
          calcium-, magnesium carbonate, sodium hydroxide, ammonium
          hydroxide, sodium, potassium-, ammonium sulpide, zeolites,
          iron hydroxide, iron carbonate, iron sulphide, or mixtures
          thereof, etc., at an elevated temperature. Under these
          conditions the carbohydrate and lignin content of the plant
          matter are attacked and both constituents contribute to the
          final product. Under the influence of these alkaline reacting
          materials on the plant material at the elevated temperatures
          of between 150 C and 370 C (377 C is the approximate critical
          temperature of water) in presence of water a bitumen-like
          material is produced, which is composed of alipathic,
          hydroaromatic and aromatic compounds together with large
          amounts of phenol compounds and phenol carbonic acids which
          latter can be separated easily from the neutral substances by
          formation of phenolates, which when acidified form free
          phenols and phenol carbonic acids. The bitumen-like material
          reacts easily with oxygen. It can be converted by
          hydrogenation or cracking into liquid hydrocarbons, containing
          alipathic, hydroaromatic and aromatic hydrocarbons. They
          possess a rather high anti-knock value. The carbon content of
          the original carbohydrate material is about 40 to 44%, that of
          the lignin is 62 to 65%. Carbohydrates and lignin are
          converted by the process of my invention into bitumen-like
          material with about 75 to 80% of carbon and 14 to 19% of
          oxygen. When the said bitumen-like material is subjected to
          complete hydrogenation or cracking, it loses its oxygen and
          yields a crude oil, containing between 86 and 91% of carbon.
          Incomplete hydrogenation or cracking results in an
          asphalt-like intermediate material with about 82 to 86% of
          carbon and about 10 to 12% of oxygen. The liquid hydrocarbons
          referred to are found to possess boiling points of between 40
          and above 250 C at normal pressure and are practically free
          from oxygen. </p>
        <p align="left">From my previous publication, dealing with the
          conversion of pure cellulose or carbohydrate. It appears that
          55.2% of their original carbon content is contained in the
          protoproduct. In contrast with this, repeated experiments
          according to the process of my present application reveal that
          64.5% of the original carbon in sugar cane appears in the
          protoproduct.&nbsp; In contrast with this, repeated
          experiments according to the process of my present application
          reveal that 64.5% of the original carbon in sugar cane appears
          in the protoproduct. Water-free sugar cane contains
          approximately 16.65% lignin with 28.2% of the sugar cane
          carbon and 83.35% carbohydrates with 71.8% of the sugar cane
          carbon. Applying to the carbohydrate constituent the yield
          figure of 55.2% of my previous publication, there should be
          obtained in the protoproduct, there should be obtained in the
          protoproduct 71.8 x 0.552 = 39.6% of sugar cane carbon. The
          following table, based upon more than 50 experiments covering
          a period of years, shows the average yields in carbon from
          sugar cane, the carbon content of the sugar cane being 100: </p>
        <p align="left">In the protoproduct… 64.5% of original carbon. <br>
          In hydrogenated bitumen containing gasoline, kerosene, asphalt
          and residue… 61% <br>
          In gasoline, kerosene, lubrication oil and residue… 59.9% <br>
          In gasoline, kerosene and lubrication oil… 44.7% </p>
        <p align="left">It is obvious from the foregoing that the lignin
          constituent has furnished a material amount of the liquid and
          semi-liquid material. Otherwise, the increased yield above the
          figure of 35.9% postulated on my previous publication would
          not be possible. </p>
        <p align="left">It is also important to note that a very large
          part of the carbon recovered in the protoproduct appears
          ultimately in the commercially desirable fractions, gasoline,
          kerosene and lubrication oil. This further serves to show the
          importance of the invention and the valuable part which the
          lignin constituent contributes to the final result. </p>
        <p align="left">Further proof of the fact that the lignin
          constituent contributes to the valuable end products is found
          in the fact that a substantial percentage of CH<sub>3</sub>O
          (methoxy) is present in the conversion products of
          lignin-containing plant material but is not found in the
          conversion products of carbohydrates alone. </p>
        <p align="left">The discovery that lignin-containing plant
          materials may be used has great commercial significance. This
          is best shown by a cost comparison. From the Statistical
          Abstract of the United States for the year 1941, p. 755, it
          appears that the average yield of cotton per acre for the
          years 1936-1940 was 239 pounds and that the average price per
          ton was $191.20. Production figures for sugar cane in the same
          period show an average annual production of 18.55 tons per
          acre in the continental United States and 36.5 tons in Hawaii.
          The figures for Cuba, Puerto Rico and the Philippines compare
          closely with the figures for Hawaii. The average price of the
          sugar can (wet weight) was $2.97. In the other countries
          mentioned the price is undoubtedly much lower.&nbsp; In
          comparison, therefore, it is seen that the production per acre
          per year in cotton is 0.12 tons and in green sugar cane is 18
          to 36 tons, and that the price for sugar cane (dry weight) is
          $15.85 (or $11.85 based on 8-% or 75% water content in green
          sugar cane) per ton as against $191.20 for cotton. These vast
          differences in yield and cost open up, at a price which is
          well within commercial possibilities, sources of raw material
          which were not available according to my old publications. </p>
        <p align="left">In the foregoing comparison of raw material
          costs, I have referred to green sugar cane on a dry weight
          basis, however, bagassse, which is sugar cane from which about
          10 to 15% of its weight has been extracted, may be used.
          Bagasse finds no use at the present time except for burning
          under boilers and, to a very limited extent, for use in
          wall-board. Consequently, my invention makes it possible to
          utilize a material that has been, to all intents and purposes,
          a waste material, and thereby to conserve a product, mineral
          oil, which is rapidly becoming exhausted. As pointed out
          above, other waste materials available in very large
          quantities, e.g., seaweed, sawdust, corn stalks or straw may
          also be used. </p>
        <p align="left">By the process disclosed herein, I start with
          plant material where in the cellulose and the lignin are both
          present. I have made the surprising discovery that in these
          circumstances the lignin behaves differently from plant lignin
          which has been separated from the carbohydrates, so that it is
          susceptible to processing at relatively low cost and with a
          yield of solid semi-liquid and liquid material from the lignin
          constituent of the plant material. Prior to the making of the
          present invention it was my belief that substantially pure
          carbohydrates are the only suitable source materials for such
          a process and that lignin, far from contributing
          advantageously to the process, would probably interfere with
          its function. </p>
        <p align="left">A fundamental part of my present invention,
          therefore is that the pant lignin, if connected with
          carbohydrates in the original plant material, behaves
          differently from lignin which has been isolated by the
          saccharification or other conversion of the carbohydrates.
          Isolated lignin can hardly be converted into semi-liquid or
          liquid material, whereas, by the present process, using as
          starting substances plant material containing both cellulose
          and lignin, the lignin constituent responds t the treatment
          and contributes to the final result. </p>
        <p align="left">As already stated, the processes of the present
          invention can be carried out discontinuously or continuously.
          Then working discontinuously, the plant material containing
          carbohydrates and lignin, water and alkaline reacting
          material, e.g., limestone, are heated to temperatures of
          between 150° C and 370° C. Instead of limestone, I may use
          dolomite, magnesite, or the corresponding hydroxides, or
          alkali-, or ammonium hydroxides or carbonated or iron
          hydroxide or iron carbonate, or sulph-hydrates, or sulphides.
          Under these conditions, the carbohydrates and lignin are
          converted into a bitumen-like material, containing from
          between 14% to 19% of oxygen. At the same time, gases are
          produced which contain, besides carbon dioxide, alipathic
          hydrocarbons, mostly methane. In the aqueous solution are
          found a great number of compounds, from which can be isolated
          phenols and phenol carbonic acids and esters, like formic acid
          methyl ester, and other substances, like acetone and lower
          fatty acids. In order to recover these rather valuable
          substances from the aqueous liquid, well-known chemical and
          physical methods should be resorted to. The resulting watery
          liquid after addition of new amounts of alkaline reacting
          material may serve for the next operation. </p>
        <p align="left">The bitumen-like material has a rather low
          viscosity and a brownish-black color. In contact with air,
          polymerization takes place with the formation of substances
          which are more viscous and ultimately become more or less
          solidified. Known methods permit the extraction from this
          bitumen-like material of any acid-reacting substances, such as
          phenols and phenol carbonic acids. The bitumen, called
          ‘protoproduct’, contains oxygen bound in different forms, for
          instance in form of ketones and complex phenols or phenol
          carbonic acids with alipathic side chains. The protoproduct
          has a thermal content of about 140,000 BTU per gallon as
          compared to 105,000 for gasoline. </p>
        <p align="left">This bitumen-like material can be used as a
          source for phenols by treating it with alkali or with liquid
          water at high temperatures and pressure. Phenols then are more
          soluble than in cold water. Furthermore, phenol anhydrides are
          hydrated under formation of phenols. One can, furthermore, get
          increased yields of these phenols by carrying out an
          incomplete hydrogenation which splits of alipathic side chains
          without eliminating the phenol group oxygen. In this way
          phenols are obtained which can be used for those purposes
          where phenols find normal use, for instance for explosives,
          plastics, disinfectants, etc. </p>
        <p align="left">In order to get oxygen-free hydrocarbons, this
          bitumen-like material, the protoproduct, has to be
          hydrogenated under conditions whereby practically all oxygen
          present is removed. This can be done with hydrogen or
          hydrogen-containing gases, e.g., water gas under pressure
          (50-500 atmospheres) at elevated temperature (325°-475° C) and
          the use of appropriate hydrogenation catalysts, for instance
          molybdenum, tungsten or tin compounds. If the hydrogenation is
          practically complete, then hydrocarbons free of or with small
          amounts of oxygen with boiling ranges from 30° C up to 250° C
          (at pressures of 3-4 mm mercury) are obtained. Analysis shows
          that the resulting hydrocarbons are of alipathic,
          hydroaromatic and aromatic nature. The higher boiling
          fractions which give an excellent lubrication oil contain OCH<sub>3</sub>-methoxyl



          groups. This is proof that they derive from the lignin
          content. Because carbohydrates alone give compounds free of
          methoxyl. </p>
        <p align="left">The production of those hydrocarbons can be
          accomplished in different ways. One can treat the plant
          material containing carbohydrate and lignin, preferably in the
          presence of alkali and moisture, first at temperatures up to
          370° C in order to produce the protoproduct. Hydrogenation
          catalysts have to be added to the plant material. The
          conversion and hydrogenation processes are carried out in a
          one-step process during and after the bitumen-forming process
          with hydrogen or hydrogen containing gases, e.g., water gas
          under pressure. In order to carry out the hydrogenation the
          temperature has to be kept at between 325° and 450° C. When
          oxygen-free hydrocarbons result besides compounds which
          contain OCH<sub>3</sub> groups. About 45% of the carbon of the
          plant material used can be converted into these liquid
          hydrocarbons. </p>
        <p align="left">One can carry out the conversion separately from
          the hydrogenation. The production of the protoproduct takes
          place at temperatures up to 370° C. Then to the resulting
          protoproduct hydrogenation catalysts are added and the
          hydrogenation is carried out at elevated temperatures
          (350-475° C) and initial hydrogen pressures (at room
          temperatures) up to 500 atmospheres. The processes can be
          carried out continuously or discontinuously. </p>
        <p align="left">In those cases where the hydrogenation of the
          protoproduct is not intended, the elimination of the bound
          oxygen can be carried out by a cracking process. The
          oxygen-containing protoproduct has to be heated to
          temperatures between 250° and 600° C without catalysts or in
          the presence of substances with highly developed internal
          surfaces, i.e., activated carbon, silica gel, aluminum
          silicates, zeolites, permutites, copper compounds and
          asbestors, or colloidal silicic acid, etc., under pressure.
          Then an intramolecular combution takes place. The oxygen
          present is removed, mostly in the form of carbon dioxide and
          water, alcohols, ketones, and fatty acids. Oxygen-free
          hydrocarbons result, containing besides alipathic and
          hydroaromatic hydrocarbons and consequently these hydrocarbons
          produces from plant material containing carbohydrates and
          lignin in accordance with the process of my invention exhibit
          a high anti-knock value. Coke is produces besides low-boiling
          hydrocarbons and higher-boiling or melting residues. In all
          cases they contain alipathics, aromatics and hydroaromatics.
          If this cracking process is carried out at temperatures above
          500° C, the amount of aromatic hydrocarbons is greatly
          increased. When the hydrogenation or cracking is not carried
          out completely, then the higher-boiling fractions show the
          presence of asphalt-like material, which can be used for the
          same purposes as natural asphalt. </p>
        <p align="left">In order to carry out the aforementioned
          conversion process, the pant material containing carbohydrate
          and lignin is preferably disintegrated and ten mixed with the
          alkaline reacting substances in solution or in suspension. The
          resulting mass is conducted through heated tubes with the help
          of pumps. The heating of the tubes is effected from the
          outside to the desired temperature, at which the conversion of
          the plant material proceeds. After having converted the
          carbohydrate and lignin of the plant material into a
          bitumen-like material, the reaction product is removed from
          the heating zone by passing either through a reduction valve
          or into reservoirs, which after having been filled
          alternately, press the converted material through a cooling
          device so that a separation of the reaction products can be
          effected into gas, aqueous liquid and bitumen. The gas, liquid
          and semi-liquid reaction products can then be utilized. </p>
        <p align="left">The bitumen separated from the gas and the
          aqueous liquid can be converted with small lost of
          carbon-containing material into liquid hydrocarbons by
          hydrogenation, whereby appropriate catalysts, like molybdenum,
          tungsten, or tn compounds, not subject to being poisoned by
          sulphur compounds, can be employed. </p>
        <p align="left">Nitrogen-containing substances can be produced
          by reacting the plant material or the bitumen with a source of
          reactive nitrogen, such as ammonium hydroxide. </p>
        <p align="left">Sulphur-containing compounds can be formed by
          reacting the plant material or bitumen with a source of
          reactive sulphur, such as sulphides like Na<sub>2</sub>S or
          FeS or sulph-hydrates by reacting it with substances
          containing the SH group such as NaHS. </p>
        <p align="left">Valuable products containing bound sulphur and
          nitrogen in the molecule are obtained from plant material
          containing carbohydrates and lignin by reaction with a source
          of reactive sulphur and nitrogen, e.g. (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>S
          or NH<sub>4</sub>HS. </p>
        <p align="left">In the accompanying drawings I illustrate two
          arrangements for carrying out the process described above.
          They are merely by way of example and are not intended to
          limit the scope of the present invention in any way. </p>
        <p align="left">Figure 1 diagrammatically shows an arrangement
          whereby the formation of the protoproduct and its
          hydrogenation are carried out at the same time in the same
          apparatus. </p>

        </div>
        <p align="left">Figure 2 shows an arrangement in which the
          conversion into protoproduct is carried out before its
          hydrogenation. </p>
        <div align="left">
          <center>

          </center>
        </div>
        <p align="left">In the arrangement shown in Figure 1 a mixture
          of plant material containing carbohydrates and lignin with
          water and alkali in container 1 is fed by pressure pump 2 into
          the pipe still 3. In pipe still 3 the mixture is subjected to
          an elevated temperature in accordance with the above
          disclosure. From there it goes to the reaction tower 4
          (preferably insulated). Such gaseous products as are already
          formed at this stage, as well as unused hydrogen or hydrogen
          containing gas (see later), are drawn off through valve 5 and
          sent through a condenser 6. The liquids formed in that
          condenser are collected in tank 7, and may be drawn therefrom
          through valves 8, 8<sup>1</sup>. Those gases that were not
          condensed in condenser 6 are drawn off by reduction valve 9. </p>
        <p align="left">The liquid part of the mixture emerging from
          pipe still 3 is allowed to flow downwardly in reaction tower 4
          which may be filled with packing material 10 (preferably the
          packing material described in my US Patent # 1,796,501).
          Baffle plates (not shown) or other conventional means to slow
          down the descent of the mixture may be utilized in addition to
          or instead of the packing material 10. </p>
        <p align="left">Hydrogen or hydrogen containing gases, e.g.
          water gas are fed into the system by compressor 11 through
          pipe 12. A valve or other suitable connection at 13, which
          divides the hydrogen stream, permits part of the hydrogen
          stream to mix the disintegrated plant material prior to it
          entry into the pipe still 3, while the other part of the
          hydrogen stream proceeds to the bottom of reaction tower 4. </p>
        <p align="left">By the time the mixture reaches the bottom of
          reaction tower 4 it has been converted into practically
          completely hydrogenated material. It moves through condenser
          14. The end product goes through valve or valves 15a and 15b
          into tank or tanks 16a, 16b, from where it may be drawn off by
          valves 17a, 17b. Valves 18a and 18b allow the release of
          pressure in the tanks 16a and 16b. </p>
        <p align="left">A suitable catalyst is added to the mixture in
          container 1 when carbohydrate and lignin conversion and
          hydrogenation are carried out in accordance with the
          above-described process. </p>
        <p align="left">The above-described process may be used without
          parts 11, 12 and 13 if conversion without hydrogenation is
          desired. Protoproduct and artificial bituminous asphalt are
          then obtained as intermediary products which may be used as
          source material for penol compounds or may be converted into
          valuable end products by hydrogenation or cracking separately
          carried out. </p>
        <p align="left">An apparatus for carrying out the hydrogenation
          separately is shown in Figure 2. </p>
        <p align="left">The mixture of plant material, water and
          alkaline reacting material is led from container 19 by
          pressure pump 20 into pipe still 21. From pipe still 21 the
          mixture goes to the top of the reaction tower 22 and flows
          therein downwards. It is kept there at the conversion
          temperature. The converted material lows through a condenser
          23 into a receiver 24, which can be emptied through valve 25.
        </p>
        <p align="left">The gasified part of the mixture composed mostly
          of CO<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O and CH<sub>4</sub> is drawn
          off through condensers 26 and 27 and into tank 28. From this
          tank 28 condensed material may be drawn off to the outside
          through valve 29. The gases CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub>
          proceed to the absorption and conversion tower 31 through
          valve 30. CO<sub>2</sub> is absorbed and CH<sub>4</sub>
          converted into hydrogen. This hydrogen together with
          unconverted hydrogen from a hydrogenation tower 34 and
          hydrogen freshly added at 32 are transported by compressor 33
          into the bottom of the tower 34 which may be provided with
          packing material or baffle plates (not shown). The unused
          hydrogen together with CH<sub>4</sub> produced during
          hydrogenation leaves 34 at 39 and enters the CH<sub>4</sub>
          conversion apparatus 31. </p>
        <p align="left">The protoproduct collected in 24 leaves at 35.
          At 35 the hydrogenation catalyst may be added. The mixture
          with the help of pump 37 is pumped through the pipe still 38
          and enters at the top f hydrogenation tower 34. There it is
          hydrogenated. It leaves the tower 34 at 39, goes through a
          condenser 40 and enters through valves 41a and 41b into the
          storage vessels 42a and 42b. Those can be emptied through
          valves 43a and 43b by closing 41a or 41b and opening 44a or
          44b. </p>
        <p align="left">By subjecting to these discontinuous or
          continuous processes in accordance with my invention all kinds
          of plant material containing carbohydrate and lignin, phenols,
          bitumen, asphalts and finally oxygen-free hydrocarbons of high
          anti-knock value are obtained. The great advantage of my
          processes can be seen in the fact that valueless material,
          like algae, seaweed, peat, grass, leaves, corn stalks,
          bagasse, wood, molasses, etc., which are produced continuously
          by nature and which otherwise would be converted by slow
          combustion into valueless CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O,
          can be utilized to good advantage. It follows that it is no
          longer necessary to resort to lignite and bituminous coal for
          artificial production of hydrocarbons. </p>
        <p align="left">Modification of the process and apparatus
          described above, all within the scope of the present
          invention, will readily occur to the expert. The scope of the
          invention therefore is deemed to be limited by the appended
          claims only. [Claims not included here\</p>
