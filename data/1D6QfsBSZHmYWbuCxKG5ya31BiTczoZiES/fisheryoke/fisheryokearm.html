          than 100 MPG with Low Emissions </b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Yoke-Arm technology increases piston dwell during combustion for
      high combustion and fuel efficiencies in combination with
      significant power gains. All with the addition of a single
      component part, the yoke-arm.<br>

      &nbsp; <br>
      Fisher Technologies has developed a modern-day performance
      increase for all piston engines which dramatically improves the
      efficiency for conventional engines, both gasoline and diesel.
      This unique cutting edge technology provides substantial increases
      in fuel economy, significant reductions in exhaust emissions and
      more power just by adding a "yoke-arm" between the piston rod and
      power-shaft. A simple mechanical combination, never before
      developed for piston engines, uses a unique yoke-arm linkage that
      connects the piston rod to the crankshaft, yet leaves the
      remaining mechanical arrangement for conventional piston engines
      relatively unchanged.<br>
      <br>
      This new arrangement uses a unique yoke-arm which substantially
      increases piston dwell during combustion to significantly increase
      combustion efficiencies. Surprisingly, this simple modification
      not only provides large gains in combustion efficiencies, but also
      greatly decreases piston rod angularity and the associated piston
      friction. The result is superior fuel economy, increased power and
      reduced emissions for both conventional crankshaft powered
      gasoline and diesel engines. Most all conventional engines can be
      accommodated such as single-cylinder, V-type, in-line,
      horizontally-opposed and radial with no restrictions to engine
      size or application.<br>
      <br>
      The low cost and simplicity to implement the Fisher yoke-arm
      surprisingly translates to large performance benefits for both
      piston engines and compressors. As it turns out, piston driven air
      compressors and air conditioners also become a viable application
      with significant increases in mechanical efficiencies that require
      much less power. This new technology offers an easy approach to
      substantially increase engine performance and fuel economy while
      also reducing the engine size through increased power. Diesel
      engines will especially gain a large advantage because the slower
      burning diesel fuels derive great benefit from the added piston
      dwell during combustion. Such large increases in piston dwell are
      not possible with conventional engines or the many other
      experimental engine technologies you might have read about. The
      Fisher yoke-arm technology for piston engines has finally achieved
      the much needed combustion efficiencies with the necessary
      simplicity, low cost and superior performance that so many other
      attempts using mechanical arrangements have failed to do.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      <div align="center"><b>Summary of Benefits</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      The essence of this advancement is the dramatic increase in
      combustion and mechanical efficiencies just by using a simple
      modification for the piston rod/crankshaft linkage. It is well
      known that fuel savings occur at slower speeds and lower engine
      rpm which correlate to increased piston dwell. The added dwell
      provided by the yoke-arm makes the engine think it is running at a
      slower speed. Increased piston dwell provides this "virtual"
      slower speed advantage, but without the loss in power associated
      with conventional engines running at reduced speeds and lower rpm.
      The fuel savings made possible by the Fisher yoke-arm might be
      compared to the effects of a “super” overdrive for automobiles
      during highway driving. Of course, such a super overdrive with the
      same fuel savings and power as Fisher does not exist in today’s
      transmissions. However, those familiar with the benefits of
      overdrive might consider that the Fisher Technology in combination
      with the transmission overdrives used today, will realize
      increases in fuel economies and savings that will be quite
      astonishing. Also, the substantial power gains and significant
      reductions in exhaust emissions will be a great addition to the
      substantial fuel economies...<br>

      engines which dramatically improves the performance of all
      conventional engines for both gasoline and diesel. This unique and

      the much needed combustion efficiencies with the necessary
      simplicity, low cost and superior performance that so many other
      attempts using mechanical arrangements have failed to do.<br>
      <br>
      <div align="center"><b>Yoke Technology – Previous Attempts</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      There have been many previous attempts to utilize the “yoke”
      mechanism for piston engines. Most attempts have been met with
      limited success or no success at all. And all have failed to
      produce widespread application or develop worldwide interest.
      Russell Bourke’s pioneering effort to incorporate the “scotch
      yoke” mechanism into the engine designs of the 1940’s &amp; 1950s
      has been the most successful attempt to date. Bourke deserves much
      credit for Fisher’s “yoke-arm” technology because the Fisher
      design was, in fact, inspired by Bourke’s work and his promotion
      of the yoke concept for piston engines.<br>
      <br>
      Bourke’s R&amp;D efforts provided Fisher a “bridge” to a superior
      design, which now includes additional features unknown to Bourke,
      and has significantly advanced engine performance beyond even what
      Fisher or Bourke was expecting. Many will recognize Russell
      Bourke, and also Collins Motor Corporation’s (CMC Power Systems),
      Roger Richard and others, all Bourke’s modern day protégés, as
      determined pioneers who made significant contributions toward the
      advancement of piston engines. The eventual widespread success of
      the Fisher yoke-arm for piston engines and air compressors will
      promote increased recognition and appreciation for Bourke and
      others in their determined pioneering efforts.<br>
      <br>
      It will soon be obvious to many engine manufacturers and engine
      advocates that Russell Bourke and others understood the importance
      of continuing the evolution of technology within the Engine
      Industry, although Bourke could not quite bring about the final
      aspects of the needed breakthrough. Fisher has finally completed
      the equation for a superior piston engine design by discovering a
      new crankshaft linkage called the yoke-arm.<br>
      <br>
      <div align="center"><b>Yoke-Arm Technology – How it Works</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      The Fisher “Yoke-Arm” Technology for piston engines provides
      unprecedented advantages for both the user and manufacturer. You
      can see the surprising simplicity for such big time benefits with
      just the addition of a Yoke-Arm.<br>
      <br>
      ... Substantial increases in fuel economy<br>
      ... Much lower emissions<br>
      ... Significant power increases<br>
      ... Less weight and more compact<br>
      .... Considerable increases power/weight ratios<br>
      ... Lower manufacturing costs for the same power<br>
      ... Minimal retooling required for the same power<br>
      ... Minimal retooling required for existing product lines<br>
      <br>
      <div align="center"><b>Yoke-Arm Advantages vs. Previous Attempts</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Fisher has added a uniquely designed “yoke-arm” between the piston
      rod and crankshaft which is patent protected, both US &amp;
      foreign (US patent no. 7,328,682). The yoke-arm is much different
      than previously tried yoke mechanisms such as, for example, the
      Bourke scotch yoke or “Bourke-Cycle” as previously discussed. The
      Fisher yoke-arm (shown below), an important and integral part of
      this breakthrough technology for piston engines, provides two main
      advantages over Bourke and conventional engine designs :<br>
      <br>
      (1) The increased piston dwell provided by Fisher is well beyond
      that possible with Bourke’s scotch yoke and associated “harmonic
      motion” for improving combustion efficiencies, and also well
      beyond all attempts by others. The Fisher yoke-arm can be designed
      for more or less dwell depending on the needs of particular
      applications, which is a severe constraint for the scotch yoke. <br>
      <br>
      (2) In addition to increased piston dwell, the added benefit of
      much less piston friction plus the increased mechanical advantage
      over conventional engines contribute to superior gains in
      mechanical efficiencies promoting even higher performance and
      added fuel economy. As it turns out, there is about a 10%
      mechanical advantage over the conventional engine piston rod-crank
      relationship.<br>

      <br>
      Computer modeling and performance curves have demonstrated
      superior advantages when compared to conventional engines, and FEA
      testing has been completed for a very effective yoke-arm design.
      FEA testing shows that 3½" stroke engines will operate with ease
      above 6000 rpm. Based on the success of computer modeling and
      preliminary prototype testing, a second prototype is currently
      under construction with dyno testing scheduled for completion by
      early 2015. Our development team, has learned the benefits of
      piston dwell, and expects that dyno testing will validate the
      superior performance demonstrated by computer modeling, and also
      expects to reconfirm dyno test results for an earlier 2-stroke

      Fisher's yoke-arm offers new, exciting and innovative
      "technological upgrades" for all conventional piston engines.
      Engines that are produced for the automotive, farming &amp;
      construction, marine, aircraft, recreational, lawn &amp; garden
      and motorcycle industries, both gasoline and diesel, will
      especially benefit to help protect our environment. Although
      performance benefits are substantial, it turns out that the
      conventional engine component parts are not appreciably affected.
      Performance curves derived from computer modeling plus our
      preliminary dyno tests have shown that the Fisher yoke-arm
      technology offers unprecedented operational and performance
      advantages never before achieved with a single modification that
      offers such simplicity and reduced cost for piston engines. An
      important strength for the Fisher Technology, is the relative ease
      of modifying existing engine arrangements at the factory.
      Retooling by engine manufacturers will be minimal, and the degree
      of simplicity that affords such big time performance benefits has
      never before been possible.<br>
      <br>
      <div align="center"><b>Advantages for Air Compressors Also</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      In addition to piston engines, efficiencies for piston driven air
      compressors are also substantially improved when using the
      yoke-arm mechanism. Some of the important benefits for compressors
      will be the noticeable reductions in energy required to operate
      air conditioning and refrigeration systems. Substantial increases
      in mechanical efficiencies, due to significant mechanical
      advantages and reduced piston friction, greatly reduce the power
      requirements for air compressor, refrigeration and heat pump
      systems. Home heating and air conditioning applications will
      experience noticeable reductions in power requirements which will
      reduce everyone's energy bills.<br>

      <div align="center"><b>Yoke-Arm Technology - Some Performance
          Evaluations</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      The following performance curves compare the differences between
      engines with the same stroke and displacement. The blue curves
      show what happens when you modify the same engine using the Fisher
      yoke-arm technology. These graphs, produced through computer
      modeling, were selected to show some of the surprising features of
      the yoke-arm technology.<br>
      <br>
      Computer modeling shows a significant difference between piston
      dwells for Fisher vs. conventional. Yoke-arm design parameters can
      vary the amount of dwell to accomodate different engine
      applications.<br>
      <br>
      When calculating at approx. 15% travel of the down stroke (58.5
      degrees crank rotation for Fisher) during combustion, the yoke-arm
      piston dwell for this particular engine configuration is about 40%
      more than that of conventional. That is enough to double the fuel
      economy.<br>
      <br>
      Also, the added benefits of higher piston compression velocities
      (not shown) promote greater air/fuel turbulence for extra
      combustion efficiencies that further contribute to fuel savings.<br>
      <br>
      The yoke-arm reduces piston rod angularity which greatly decreases
      piston lateral forces and side loading for much less piston
      friction and increased mechanical efficiencies. Reduced rod
      angularity promotes less heat build-up which in turn promotes less
      piston and cylinder wear requiring less engine cooling. These
      benefits result in longer engine life and are especially relevant
      to air cooled engines such as motorcycles, aircraft, lawn &amp;
      garden, and such.<br>

      <br>
      Disclosed are crankshaft, single-plate cam and beam mechanisms
      that provide significant improvements in performance for 2 &amp;
      4-stroke engines, compressors and pumps. These cost effective
      mechanisms include linkages with the new and improved use of
      pivoting arms that operate with a variety of cylinder
      arrangements. One embodiment of the crankshaft mechanism has its
      crankpin roller positioned within a novel yoke-arm. The cam
      mechanism uses a pair of centrally positioned parallel links that
      are connected to roller cam followers and single or
      diametrically-opposed pistons. A pair of laterally extending
      follower arms connects to the ends of the links to provide support
      and alignment for the piston rods. Between the reciprocating
      links, cam followers and follower arms is a rotating odd-lobe
      plate cam.; A beam mechanism uses opposite-direction extending
      balancing beams that are connected to links, cam followers and
      piston rods.<br>
      <br>
      <b>TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      The present invention relates to reciprocating piston power drive
      equipment that operates with reciprocating engines, compressors,
      fluid motors and pumps. Piston equipment includes vehicles,
      aircraft, boats, air conditioners and power tools.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      Conventional piston engines and compressors use a crankshaft with
      an attached piston rod linkage, thereby causing limitations in the
      areas of efficiency, balance, noise, power shaft rpm reduction,
      weight and cost. These limitations are caused by six primary
      disadvantages: (1) Conventional crankshaft mechanisms oscillate
      the piston rods causing rod vibrations and piston side thrust
      resulting in piston friction. (2) Conventional crankshaft
      mechanisms have constraints for increasing piston dwell at the top
      of the stroke to improve engine efficiency. (3) Because of piston
      connecting rod angularity, conventional crankshaft mechanisms have
      non-harmonic piston motion which causes secondary inertia force
      vibrations for most arrangements. (4) For the operation of diesel
      engines, conventional crankshaft mechanisms cause piston knocking
      against the cylinder walls because of piston rod oscillations in
      combination with high combustion pressures. (5) Crankshafts
      require heavy counterweights for balance and transmissions for
      power shaft rpm reduction. (6) Conventional crankshafts require
      4-stroke instead of 2-stroke operation for optimum efficiencies
      which result in increased weight and cost.<br>
      <br>
      Diametrically-opposed piston, yoke crankshaft (scotch yoke)
      engines have been acknowledged for over 100 years. The scotch yoke
      engine has been given much consideration by a few manufacturers
      for replacing some conventional crankshaft engines. Today, several
      companies are continuing to develop and promote the yoke
      crankshaft engine in an attempt to establish acceptance by the
      public.<br>
      <br>
      In U.S. Pat Nos. 399,593, 2,122,676, 2,513,514, 4,013,048 and
      5,331,926, there are disclosed yoke crankshaft engines. The
      crankpin carries a slider block or crankpin roller that rolls
      within the yoke-follower (yoke). The yoke-follower is connected to
      the ends of the piston rods; the pistons and rods reciprocate
      along a centerline perpendicular to and intersecting the
      crankshaft axis. Therefore, these engines eliminate piston rod
      angularity and provide harmonic piston motion that results in the
      benefits of longer piston dwell and less vibration.<br>
      <br>
      With the opposed-piston yoke crankshaft engine, lateral movement
      of the crankpin with its attached roller causes piston side thrust
      against the cylinder walls and piston friction; but, less friction
      than conventional crankshaft engines for the same rod length.
      Because of the increased piston dwell at the top of the stroke and
      reduced piston friction, the yoke crankshaft engine efficiencies
      are substantially improved when compared to today's short to
      medium length piston rod conventional engines. However, a drawback
      for the present day yoke crankshaft is that for diesel engines the
      piston rods need to be extra heavy for supporting forces related
      to the lateral movement of the crankpin roller bearing.<br>
      <br>
      The yoke crankshaft engine has a third advantage in that
      under-piston scavenging pumps can be provided for 2-stroke
      opposed-piston engine operation. Since the piston rods reciprocate
      along the axis of the cylinders, rod seals can be easily installed
      to seal off the crankcase allowing a low cost and compact means of
      self-aspirating 2-stroke engines. When operating as a 2-stroke
      two-cylinder engine with 180[deg.] alternating power strokes and
      using auxiliary balancing weights for low vibration, the yoke
      crankshaft engine becomes a formidable rival to the much more
      complex and expensive 4-stroke four-cylinder, horizontally-opposed
      or in-line conventional engine. Because of feasibility
      limitations, a drawback for present day yoke crankshaft engines is
      that they are limited to horizontal-opposed cylinder arrangements.<br>
      <br>
      In attempting to overcome the kinematic disadvantages of the
      crankshaft mechanism, cam engines have been developed. Primary
      drawbacks for cam engines are structural complexity and increased
      expense which are caused by the difficulty in providing a simple
      means for maintaining cam followers in contact with the cam track.
      Cam engines generally have less piston friction and improved
      balance compared to crankshaft engines.<br>
      <br>
      In U.S. Pat. Nos. 1,817,375, 2,124,604 and 4,697,552, there are
      disclosed single-plate three-lobe cam engines. These engines
      include slides or rollers for supporting the sides of links
      (linking-rods) that couple together diametrically-opposed pistons.
      Each link also connects two opposed roller cam followers that make
      contact on opposite sides of a three-lobe cam. The connecting
      pistons, followers and links reciprocate along a centerline
      perpendicular to and intersecting the cam axis, thereby promoting
      harmonic piston motion. The conventional art of guiding and
      supporting the links is a simple and low-cost linkage arrangement
      for maintaining the roller followers in contact with the cam, and
      these linkages serve many light duty machine applications such as
      typesetting, automatic packing, shoe making, etc. However, for
      heavy duty applications like engines and compressors, link side
      thrust and link friction become a problem. The above patents
      describe linking-rod engines which use heavy duty links to support
      the side thrust that is delivered from the attached roller
      followers. To provide link support and alignment, the links
      require precision bearing surfaces that maintain contact with
      precision aligned rollers or link guides; the link guides require
      high oil pressures to reduce friction and wear.<br>
      <br>
      In U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,011,842 and 4,274,367, there are disclosed
      crankshaft beam engines that use a pair of attached longitudinal
      extending arms for providing a rocker beam (rocker lever). These
      engines have one beam which is connected to either one or two
      single-throw crankshafts for a single row engine. Disadvantages
      for these engines are cost, balance and limited to low piston
      speed applications. They require multiple unit-rows for good
      balance, and for single row applications require very large
      counter weights and still have poor balance. Because of virtually
      eliminating piston friction, these beam engines have been
      commercially successfull for some low piston speed applications.<br>
      <br>
      U.S. Pat. No. 2,417,648 discloses opposed pairs of beams for a
      four-lobe cam engine that was improved and built later as a
      two-lobe cam engine for marine and stationary applications by
      Svanemolle Wharf Co. of Copenhagen, Denmark. (Heldt in Auto. Ind.,
      Jun. 15, 1955, "Two-stroke Diesel has no Crankshaft") This engine
      met with limited success for some low rpm commercial uses. The
      two-lobe cam allows the elimination of transmissions for marine
      and some stationary applications. For one row, this double-opposed
      piston engine has the added advantage of 2-stroke operation using
      two opposed pistons in one cylinder with the cylinder positioned
      between the beams. For a one-row diesel, this engine has the
      disadvantages of requiring three cams with four roller cam
      followers, two auxiliary follower arms and heavy opposed beams.
      Also, this engine operates at very low piston speeds which further
      increase engine weight per bhp. Because of these disadvantages,
      the weight and cost of this 2-stroke beam engine are substantially
      increased when compared to conventional crankshaft engines.<br>
      <br>
      Sulzer in Switzerland has been successful producing a somewhat
      similar type of opposed beam diesel engine which uses a two-throw
      crankshaft (instead of cams) with double-opposed pistons. For each
      row, the crankshaft throws are connected to a pair of offset
      crankshaft connecting rods which are connected to the offset ends
      of complex and heavy opposed pair of beams. Each piston requires a
      separate crankshaft throw, two connecting rods, a heavy beam and
      large housing, thereby increasing weight and cost that result in
      limited applications.<br>
      <br>
      Prior art piston machines have many disadvantages that have been
      only slightly improved over the past decades. Engine efficiency,
      weight and cost, although somewhat improved, have not had
      substantial progress in these areas. Attempts have been made to
      replace the conventional crankshaft mechanism with various yoke
      crankshaft, cam and beam machine designs, but with limited
      success. Complexity, cost and marginal operational improvements
      have prevented these "improved" machines from coming to the
      forefront in today's marketplace. The present invention overcomes
      most of the disadvantages discussed in this "Background of the
      Invention" for the prior art crankshaft, cam and beam machines.
      Additionally, conventional engines use superchargers that are
      expensive, heavy and consume lots of space. The invention provides
      the novel use of under-piston pumps that overcome the
      disadvantages of the weight and expense characteristic of
      conventional superchargers while providing the same benefits of
      increased power, improved air-fuel mixing, fuel economy and lower
      emissions.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      This piston machine invention provides novel yoke-arm crankshaft,
      radial plate cam and crankshaft beam mechanisms. These mechanisms
      can improve the performance of reciprocating engines, compressors
      and liquid pumps by the novel use of pivoting arms and beams that
      provide several advantages. One advantage is that the arms and
      beams maintain the piston rod alignment in a path close to the
      axial line of the cylinders. This substantially reduces piston
      friction caused by piston rod angularity. Reduced piston friction
      has the benefits of longer engine life, less cooling, higher
      efficiencies and increased power. The mechanical efficiency of the
      invention is generally over 90% and greater than 94% can be
      achieved when using anti-friction bearings.<br>
      <br>
      Another advantage of these improved mechanisms is increased piston
      dwell that allows combustion to take place for a longer duration
      near the top of the stroke. The invention's cam, cam beam and
      crankshaft beam mechanisms provide 15-40% longer piston dwell
      compared to prior art machines. For the invention's
      opposed-piston, two yoke-arm crankshaft arrangement, piston dwells
      of 250% more than prior art yoke crankshaft or conventional
      crankshaft engines can be achieved. The invention's yoke-arm
      crankshaft dwell increases are provided by the yoke design, the
      yoke-arm's pivoting angle and/or relative alignment of the
      cylinders; and for the crankshaft beam mechanism, favorable rod
      angularity and cylinder positioning determine piston dwell. For
      the cam, piston dwell can be adjusted by modifying the cam's
      contour design and by cylinder positioning. This feature of longer
      piston dwell provides substantially improved fuel efficiencies,
      increased power and reduced emissions.<br>
      <br>
      Because piston rods are not directly connected to a crankshaft,
      piston rod angularity and secondary inertia vibratory forces are
      virtually eliminated. The result is that the invention's yoke-arm
      crankshaft, cam and crankshaft beam mechanisms have substantially
      lower vibration in comparison to today's conventional machines.<br>
      <br>
      Piston knocking is a problem for conventional diesel engines which
      have high combustion forces and oscillating piston rods that cause
      piston slap against the cylinder walls. For diesel engine
      applications, the invention is not affected by high compression
      ratios that result in piston noise because the piston rod axial
      alignment significantly reduces the piston lateral movement
      against the cylinder walls.<br>
      <br>
      The simplest and most compact mechanism of the invention is a
      yoke-arm crankshaft that uses a one-throw crankshaft with its
      crankpin positioned through a roller that rolls within a pivoting
      yoke-arm. The pivoting yoke-arm is connected to the lower end of
      one piston rod reciprocating within a single-cylinder or two
      opposed-piston rods reciprocating within two diametrically-opposed
      cylinders. Also, the yoke-arm mechanism can be arranged to operate
      as a two-throw horizontal-opposed arrangement. An alternative
      V-twin arrangement uses a pair of yoke-arms and one crankpin which
      carries a pair of rollers. A three or six-cylinder radial
      arrangement uses three yoke-arms that extend in the same rotary
      direction about a single-throw crankshaft which carries three
      crankpin rollers.<br>
      <br>
      The simplest novel cam mechanism includes two opposed follower
      arms, a one-lobe disk cam, a pair of parallel links, two cam
      followers, and one piston rod for a single-cylinder arrangement.
      The cam is positioned between and parallel to the pair of links,
      and a follower pin connects the pivoting end of each follower arm
      to a cam follower and to the respective link pair end; one end of
      the link pair connects to a piston rod. The pivoting follower arms
      guide and provide alignment for the links, cam followers and
      piston rod.<br>
      <br>
      By using low-cost follower arms that maintain operative link
      alignment and support, the invention overcomes the expensive link
      support problem which is a drawback for present day linking rod,
      cam engine mechanisms. Light weight links supported at their
      opposite ends by a pair of opposite-direction extending short
      pivot arms virtually eliminate piston side thrust and link
      friction. Compared to conventional links, the arms and links
      operate with very little friction.<br>
      <br>
      An alternative piston machine embodiment includes the previously
      discussed single cam mechanism with the addition of two beam arms
      that are attached to the follower arms. This provides a new type
      of self-balancing and offset (opposite-direction extending) rocker
      beam (rocker lever) mechanism for several types of cylinder
      arrangements. One beam configuration provides a single row,
      diametrically-opposed and offset cylinder arrangement for a
      four-cylinder engine or compressor, wherein the ends of the offset
      beam arms are connected to a pair of offset pistons. Another cam
      beam configuration is an in-line, three-cylinder arrangement with
      the beams positioned on one side of the cam track for a compact
      design. When these beam mechanisms function with a cam (one or
      three-lobe), there is an advantage of low vibration because the
      offset pair of beam arms, pistons and rods provide offsetting
      inertia forces and in unison harmonic motion. In comparison to the
      conventional crankshaft, these cam beam mechanisms provide low
      cost, low vibration alternatives for single-cylinder, in-line twin
      and two-cylinder diametrically-opposed arrangements.<br>
      <br>
      Conventional means for balancing three-lobe cam mechanisms require
      complex and costly designs for four unit-rows or six-cylinder
      radials. These complex designs are eliminated by the invention's
      simple structure cam beam mechanism which can use a one, three or
      five-lobe cam. Three-lobe cam mechanisms have the advantages of
      not requiring counter weights, and for many applications, the
      elimination of a transmission.<br>
      <br>
      For radial piston applications, one arrangement of the invention
      includes a one-lobe disk cam, four-cylinder radial configuration
      that has opposed cylinders spaced at 90[deg.] intervals. Two pairs
      of opposed follower arms are connected to the respective opposed
      pistons. This four-cylinder radial arrangement requires a one-lobe
      cam for balance, and for 2-stroke engines, has a power stroke
      every [1/4]th rotation of the output shaft providing smooth
      torque. This 2-stroke four-cylinder radial is comparable in
      performance to today's 4-stroke V-8 engine while having the
      additional advantages of improved fuel economy, decreased
      emissions and reduced vibration. Alternatively, this mechanism can
      be arranged to operate as a V-type or semiradial type arrangement.
      A three-lobe cam can be used, but requires four rows for balance,
      whereby vibrations are cancelled out due to the offset
      reciprocating forces.<br>
      <br>
      For providing an alternative four-beam, eight-cylinder radial
      arrangement, the four follower arms, as described in the previous
      four-cylinder radial discussion, can be attached to four beam arms
      that connect to four additional pistons. This beam radial
      arrangement can be used with one or three-lobe cams.<br>
      <br>
      Another alternative of the invention is a one or three-lobe cam
      with three or six cylinders radially spaced about a power shaft
      that operate with three sets of follower arms, links and cam
      followers. When using a three-lobe cam, this arrangement provides
      offsetting inertia forces for the reciprocating components,
      thereby eliminating shaft counter weights.<br>
      <br>
      A simple structure beam machine of the invention consists of a
      single throw crankshaft beam mechanism similar to the invention's
      cam beam mechanism except the cam, links and cam followers are
      replaced with a crankshaft and beam rod(s). Compared to the cam
      beam, the crankshaft beam arrangement has more vibration because
      of rod angularity. The centrally located piston(s) provide the
      same piston dwell as prior art, but the invention's outer pistons
      provide up to 40% increased dwell for improved efficiencies.<br>
      <br>
      The invention's yoke-arm crankshaft, cam, cam beam and crankshaft
      beam mechanisms provide 2-stroke and 4-stroke engines with high
      mechanical and fuel efficiencies. These novel mechanisms will
      allow lower cost 2-stroke engines to replace the heavier and more
      expensive 4-stroke engines for many applications. These 2-stroke
      two-cylinder engines provide low vibration and alternating
      180[deg.] power strokes for smooth torque, and can include
      multiple rows to form multiple cylinder arrangements for a wide
      variety of applications. Through the use of several types of novel
      self-charging and self-supercharging means, both the 2-stroke and
      4-stroke engines benefit from lower cost, lower weight and for
      some arrangements, improved air-fuel mixing and lower emissions
      compared to prior art.<br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b><br>
      <br>
      The invention provides reciprocating piston machines with novel
      yoke-arm crankshaft, plate cam and eccentric beam mechanisms which
      include the new and improved use of pivoting arms. Reduced piston
      friction and increased piston dwell are some of the fundamental
      advantages featured by the invention. Some arrangements described
      are: (1) single-cylinder, (2) in-line twin, (3) opposed
      two-cylinder, (4) V-twin, and (5) semiradial and radial.<br>
      <br>
      These reciprocating piston machines relate to internal combustion
      engines, compressors, steam engines, fluid motors and pumps; the
      machines operate with piston power drive equipment that includes
      vehicles, aircraft, boats, air conditioners and power tools.<br>
      <br>
      FIGS. 1-5 are arranged and function somewhat similar to
      conventional crankshaft engines except for the addition of
      yoke-arm(s) 6 and crankpin roller bearing(s) 4 that provide
      significant advantages.<br>
      <br>
      In FIG. 1, there is shown one embodiment of the invention that is
      a single-cylinder, yoke-arm crankshaft machine which provides the
      simplest structure and most compact arrangement of the invention.
      Crankcase 1 supports a single-throw crankshaft 2 with its crankpin
      3 positioned through a crankpin roller bearing 4. A yoke-follower
      5 is located at the pivoting yoke end of laterally-extending
      yoke-arm 6. The arm's opposite end or pivot pin end is connected
      to crankcase 1 by fixed arm pivot pin 7. Roller bearing 4 engages
      with the yoke-follower 5 and moves back-and-forth between two
      generally laterally-extending opposed yoke-follower track surfaces
      such that the yoke-arm 6 is oscillated by rotation of the crankpin
      3. The track surfaces are generally parallel to one another and
      generally aligned with the longitudinal axis of the yoke-arm, but
      the track surfaces can be nonlinear such as in some prior art
      designs. The upper part of yoke-arm 6 is extended outward to form
      an armfork 11 that is pivotally connected to the lower end of
      piston rod 8 by piston rod pin 12 with a siamesed pivotal
      connection. Rod 8 is pivotally connected at its opposite end to
      piston 9 that reciprocates within cylinder 10 which is attached to
      crankcase 1.<br>
      <br>
      In FIG. 1A, there is shown an alternative yoke-arm 6a for FIG. 1.
      FIG. 1A shows an alternative siamesed pivotal connection, wherein
      the yoke-arm 6a has a yoke-arm ear 11a that is connected to the
      piston rod's 8a forked end. Also shown, is an open end
      yoke-follower 5a opposite the pivot end. Crankpin slide-block
      bearing 4a, as an option, can replace the crankpin roller bearing
      4 of FIG. 1.<br>
      <br>
      For an opposed two-cylinder arrangement, FIG. 1 can be modified to
      include (not shown) an additional cylinder (horizontally or
      diametrically-opposed) containing a piston with its piston rod
      connected to a second armfork 11 extending from yoke-arm 6
      opposite the first armfork 11. This arrangement provides a very
      compact and low-cost mechanism for opposed two-cylinder gasoline
      engines, compressors and pumps for both 2 and 4-stroke
      applications.<br>
      <br>
      The yoke-arm crankshaft machine has substantially reduced piston
      friction when compared to the prior art yoke crankshaft machine
      without a yoke-arm. When compared to conventional crankshaft
      engines with pistons directly connected to the crankshaft, piston
      friction is even further reduced. During the piston stroke, the
      motion of piston rod pin 12 defines an arc 12a which maintains a
      close proximity to the cylinder axis. This close proximity makes
      possible less rod lateral movement for providing reduced piston
      friction. The yoke-arm virtually eliminates piston side thrust
      caused by the rotating crankpin which is a significant drawback
      for prior art yoke crankshaft and conventional crankshaft engines.<br>
      <br>
      For providing higher engine efficiencies, longer piston dwells at
      the top of the stroke can be achieved by the invention. A number
      of factors affect piston dwell: (1) Changing the position of the
      cylinder axis relative to arc 12a formed by the motion of the
      piston rod pin will increase or decrease dwell; (2) Moving rod pin
      12 further out from the yoke-arm 6 axis increases dwell, but
      causes increased piston rod lateral movement; (3) Shortening
      piston rod 8 increases piston dwell; (4) Shortening yoke-arm 6, as
      in FIG. 3, increases piston dwell; and (5) Changing the piston pin
      position increases or decreases dwell. Increasing dwell by these
      means will cause a slight increase in piston friction. These
      adjustments of piston dwell for the yoke-arm crankshaft can also
      be applied to the novel cam mechanisms and eccentric beam
      mechanisms as described later.<br>
      <br>
      The FIG. 1 arrangement has more than 30% dwell increase when
      compared to functionally acceptable prior art yoke crankshaft
      machines and about 42% more dwell compared to conventional
      crankshaft machines. Increased piston dwell provides more complete
      combustion which results in improved power, fuel economy and fewer
      emissions.<br>
      <br>
      The FIG. 1 single-cylinder arrangement has less secondary inertia
      forces than conventional crankshaft mechanisms because piston rods
      are not directly connected to crankpin 3; therefore, lower
      vibration is achieved. Similar to conventional arrangements, the
      FIG. 1 configuration can use balancing shafts to cancel out
      lateral forces from the crankshaft counterweights for providing
      excellent primary balance. When this single-cylinder arrangement
      operates as a 2-stroke, crankcase compression or under-piston pump
      engine with 360[deg.] power strokes, it becomes well suited as a
      replacement for conventional 4-stroke single-cylinder and
      two-cylinder engines. Multicylinder yoke-arm crankshaft
      arrangements of the invention can also use crankcase compression
      similar to conventional 2-stroke crankcase compression engines.<br>
      <br>
      In FIG. 1B, there is shown an under-piston scavenging pump 32,
      self-aspirating arrangement that is an addition to the FIG. 1
      machine. The cylinder 10a contains a double-acting piston 9 for
      combustion at the piston head end and compression (charging) at
      the under-piston end. Piston rod 8a extends through the center of
      a sliding rod seal 39 and through a seal guide plate 1e passage of
      crankcase head 1d that seals off crankcase 1 to provide a pump
      chamber. This laterally-reciprocating U-ring style slider seal has
      parallel upper and lower sliding surfaces laterally-extending
      outward on upper guide surface 39c and on lower guide surface 39d
      of seal guide plate 1e and is supported by crankcase head 1d. The
      convex inner seal surface seals continuously around oscillating
      piston rod 8a throughout the piston stroke. For ease of
      installation, the U-ring seal can be made in two or three sections
      and held together with a circumferential spring. This ability to
      seal off crankcase oil from pump 32 prevents contamination of
      crankcase oil by combustion products and fuel (the Sulzer RD-90
      2-stroke diesel engine, for example). Under-piston scavenging
      pumps can be used, as an option, for all cylinder arrangements of
      the invention.<br>
      <br>
      In FIG. 2, there is shown a double yoke-arm 6, single-throw
      crankshaft 2, two-cylinder 10horizontally-opposed arrangement. The
      offset horizontally-opposed arrangement uses side-by-side
      yoke-arms. The yoke-arms are opposite-direction extending and
      connected to opposed pistons 9 by a pair of piston rods 8.<br>
      <br>
      For lower vibration, FIG. 2 can be arranged with
      diametrically-opposed cylinders (axially aligned cylinders),
      whereby the longitudinal axes of yoke-arms 6 intersect the axis of
      the cylinders; the yoke-arms require a siamesed connection with
      crankpin 3. The first yoke-arm 6 has a single yoke-follower 5 end.
      The second yoke-arm has a yoke end consisting of a pair of
      yoke-follower 5 branches. The branches of the second yoke-arm are
      positioned on opposite sides of the first yoke-arm with each
      branch defining a yoke-follower. Each yoke-follower 5 having
      opposed follower track surfaces associated with a crankpin bearing
      such that the second yoke-arm 6 engages with two spaced apart
      crankpin bearings.<br>
      <br>
      For an alternative arrangement of FIG. 2, the piston rods can be
      connected to the ends of yoke-arms 5 opposite pivot pins 7,
      wherein rod pins 12 can be positioned through the longitudinal
      axis of yoke-arms 6. This provides a more compact machine and
      reduces the rotating speed of the crankpin roller bearing although
      dynamic balance is reduced.<br>
      <br>
      The use of long yoke-arms 6 and/or long piston rods 8 provides
      less piston friction. When operating as a 2-stroke gasoline
      engine, the FIG. 2 long arm 6 design has about 4% piston friction
      and about 8% for the shorter arm 6 design of FIG. 3. This compares
      to conventional 2-stroke engines that typically have 15-50% piston
      friction.<br>
      <br>
      The invention's yoke-arm machine has inherent dwell increases (up
      to 20%) which are attributed to the relationship between the
      yoke-arm 6 pivot angle and crankpin 3. When the piston moves from
      TDC to mid-stroke, the pivoting motion of the yoke-arm causes the
      crankpin to rotate about 16[deg.] for FIG. 2 (and 21.8[deg.] for
      FIG. 3) further compared to the crankpin of prior art yoke
      crankshaft engines which have their yoke-follower axis
      perpendicular to the cylinder axis throughout the stroke.<br>
      <br>
      The novel yoke-arm machine's new and improved linkages provide
      even further dwell increases (up to 20%) for a total of 40%
      increase when compared to prior art. Since prior art yoke
      crankshaft machines do not have rod oscillation or piston rod
      lateral movement, the amount of dwell is limited. Because the
      invention's yoke-arm machine has some limited piston rod lateral
      movement, significant increases in piston dwell are possible.
      Immediately after the downward or combustion stroke when maximum
      dwell occurs, piston rod pin 12 begins moving along arc 12a
      ("dwell arc") defined by the motion of rod pin 12, and dwell
      progressively decreases as the rod pin moves closer to the
      cylinder axis. For optimum machine efficiency and increased dwell,
      the cylinder axis should intersect near the central section of arc
      12a. The obtuse angle as measured at mid-stroke and formed by the
      intersection of the cylinder axis and a line connecting the
      yoke-arm pivot pin to the piston rod pin is approximately
      110[deg.]. The piston dwell increase is proportional to this angle
      which determines the amount of piston rod lateral movement or
      oscillation. Angle increases greater than the 90[deg.] threshold
      is when the invention begins to exceed the dwells of industry
      accepted prior art yoke crankshaft machines. Additional dwell
      increases of 20%, as previously mentioned, can be achieved when
      altering the cylinder position, yoke-arm length, piston rod
      length, and piston pin position, all affecting the mid-stroke
      obtuse angle. There is a trade-off between the amount of dwell
      desired vs. piston friction. Increased dwell causes increased
      piston friction, and design parameters such as the yoke-arm pivot
      angle, cylinder position, etc. must be collectively considered to
      achieve the desired machine efficiency.<br>
      <br>
      Much greater increases in piston dwell (without increasing piston
      friction) can be achieved when using the yoke-follower designs of
      FIGS. 3A &amp; 3B (described below) with the drawback of increased
      machine vibration. However, for FIG. 2 type configurations,
      vibration is minimized because of the two yoke-arm and
      opposed-piston arrangement.<br>
      <br>
      As a 180[deg.] alternating power stroke, 2-stroke engine, FIG. 2
      can be charged with under-piston scavenging pumps (ref. FIG. 1B)
      or crankcase compression. The FIG. 2 arrangement can be used as an
      alternative to replace many existing 4-stroke, four cylinder
      engine applications.<br>
      <br>
      In FIG. 3, there is shown a two yoke-arm 6, two-throw crankshaft
      2a, two-cylinder 10 horizontally-opposed arrangement. The
      opposite-direction extending yoke-arms are connected to piston
      rods 8, and each crankpin 3 is positioned within a yoke-follower
      5. This configuration operates somewhat similar to a conventional
      two-throw, two-cylinder horizontal-opposed arrangement. There is
      dynamic balance in the FIG. 3 arrangement because of the
      symmetrical opposing moving parts. The result is lower vibration
      when compared to conventional offset horizontally-opposed
      arrangements which have substantially more piston rod weight and
      rod oscillation. Also, piston dwell at the top of the stroke for
      the FIG. 3 yoke-follower design is about 50% longer compared to
      conventional crankshaft engines.<br>
      <br>
      In FIGS. 3A &amp; 3B, there are shown yoke-arms with concave yoke
      track surfaces 5a &amp; 5b contacting the top of the crankpin
      bearing 4 and convex surfaces 5c &amp; 5d at the bottom of the
      crankpin bearing.<br>
      <br>
      In FIG. 3A, there is shown a yoke-arm 6b having it's yoke-follower
      designed for providing further increases in piston dwell. Dwell
      increase at the top of the stroke is more than 50% longer compared
      to prior art yoke crankshaft machines which have their
      yoke-follower axis perpendicular to the cylinder axis. There is
      more than 65% longer dwell when compared to conventional
      crankshaft engines.<br>
      <br>
      In FIG. 3B, there is shown a yoke-arm 6c design which provides
      over 250% dwell compared to conventional crankshaft engines.
      During the 19[deg.] crankpin travel interval shown in FIG. 3B, the
      piston pauses momentarily causing a substantial dwell increase.
      The increased curvature of the arc 5b track surface compared to
      arc 5a of FIG. 3A correspondingly increases the piston dwell.
      Different radiuses of the yoke-follower tracks provide changes in
      piston motion that affect dwell, but the increased inertia forces
      limit maximum piston speeds due to component parts stress. An
      optimum yoke-follower design factoring in these constraints is
      required for different applications.<br>
      <br>
      Increases in piston dwell are especially important for diesel
      engines. With a properly designed yoke-follower, a 4000 rpm
      yoke-arm 6 diesel engine will have piston dwell increases which
      allow it to operate with the same piston dwells and fuel
      efficiencies compared to the more fuel efficient 1500 rpm diesel
      engines. And, with the improvement of much lower piston friction,
      the novel diesel engine's fuel economy will approximately double
      compared to conventional automobile diesel engines. Twice the fuel
      economy translates to significant increases in power and reduced
      engine weights for vehicles.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 3 can be configured with a yoke-arm from FIG. 3A or FIG. 3B
      with each having substantial dwell increases. The inherent balance
      characteristics of the horizontal-opposed piston configuration
      offset and cancel out the inertia forces caused by the differences
      in piston dwell for the different yoke-arms. However, there is
      some rocking imbalance which is characteristic of
      horizontally-opposed engines.<br>
      <br>
      These horizontally-opposed arrangements can be used with an
      under-piston pump (ref. FIG. 1B) for 2-stroke operation, 2-stroke
      with crankcase compression or 4-stroke engines.<br>
      <br>
      In FIG. 4, there is shown a double yoke-arm, single-throw 90[deg.]
      V-twin cylinder arrangement. Double yoke-arms 6 are connected to
      crankpin 3, two rods 8 and two pistons 9. Because of the virtual
      elimination of secondary vibrations, this V-type arrangement has
      lower vibration than the conventional 90[deg.] V-type. Yoke-arms 6
      are side-by-side similar to the FIG. 2 configuration. Among other
      applications, FIG. 4 is well suited for use as high mechanical
      efficient, compact compressors and pumps.<br>
      <br>
      In FIG. 5, there is shown a three yoke-arm 6, single-throw
      crankshaft 2, three-cylinder 10a radial arrangement. Three arms
      are positioned in the same rotary direction about and connected to
      the crankshaft, wherein each yoke-arm 6 is connected to the same
      crankpin 3 with each yoke-follower 5 containing its respective
      crankpin roller bearing 4. Sliding rod seals seal off under-piston
      pumps 32 for charging. Each seal includes a swiveling spherical
      inner-ring 39e positioned within a laterally-sliding outer-ring
      39a socket. The inner-ring contact wear is very low because of a
      relatively large contact surface area. The 120[deg.] power strokes
      for the FIG. 5 2-stroke design allow this arrangement to be well
      suited for lightweight and compact radial cylinder applications.
      As an option, one cylinder can be repositioned to its opposite
      side for providing a three-cylinder semiradial. Also, an
      additional three cylinders can be added to convert FIG. 5 into a
      six-cylinder radial.<br>
      <br>
      The novel engine design of one piston attached to one yoke-arm
      provides the advantage of reduced crankpin roller bearing sliding
      friction compared to prior art opposed type engines. Because of
      cost constraints, prior art yoke crankshaft engines do not have
      single cylinder arrangements which are now feasible with the novel
      yoke-arm crankshaft. The prior art opposed cylinder has a single
      yoke-follower with the characteristic of roller bearing reversal
      during each stroke which promotes crankpin roller bearing wear.
      The yoke-arm single cylinder arrangement has limited bearing
      reversal and results in long bearing life. This long bearing life
      advantage extends to multicylinder arrangements of the invention.
      Additionally, the yoke-arm crankshaft mechanism has lower piston
      friction, substantially increased piston dwell and provides a
      variety of low cost cylinder arrangements.<br>
      <br>
      In FIGS. 6-18, there are shown alternative piston machine
      arrangements which operate with variations of the invention's cam
      and cam beam mechanisms. For many applications, these machines
      provide 2-stroke arrangements that can replace conventional
      4-stroke engines while offering advantages.<br>
      <br>
      Similar to the invention's yoke-arm crankshaft, the cam
      mechanism's piston dwell is a function of (1) harmonic piston
      motion, (2) the position of the cylinder axis relative to the arc
      defined by the motion of follower pin 18, (3) piston rod length
      and (4) piston pin position. For optimum machine efficiency and
      increased dwell, the cylinder axis is generally tangent to the
      lower or central section of the arc that is defined by the motion
      of the piston rod pin 18 or when the cylinder axis intersects the
      arc's central section. In accordance, the obtuse angle as measured
      at mid-stroke and formed by the intersection of the cylinder axis
      and a line connecting the follower arm pivot pin 7 to the piston
      rod pin 18 is substantially greater than 90[deg.] (approx.
      110[deg.]). The piston dwell increase is proportional to the
      amount of angle greater than 90[deg.].<br>
      <br>
      Unlike the yoke-arm crankshaft, the cam mechanism does not use
      yoke-arm pivoting angles for adjusting dwell, but instead the
      dwell is affected by the cam's track profile design. Like the
      yoke-arm crankshaft, when the cam mechanism's piston rod lateral
      movement is increased, piston dwell and piston friction are
      increased accordingly. For many applications, both the cam and
      yoke-arm mechanisms have sufficient piston dwell to achieve
      significantly improved engine efficiencies without depending upon
      rod oscillation for dwell. With invention designs that minimize
      rod oscillation, about 2% or less piston friction can be achieved.
      This compares to the 15-50% piston friction typical for
      conventional 2-stroke engines.<br>
      <br>
      For a single row, the cam and cam beam mechanisms provide lower
      vibration compared to the yoke-arm crankshaft. Also, the cam
      mechanism has the advantage of using more cylinders (up to eight)
      with low vibration for single row (radial) arrangements.<br>
      <br>
      In FIGS. 6 &amp; 6A, there is shown a linking arms, radial-cam
      piston machine of the invention which includes a radial odd-lobe
      plate cam, opposing arms and follower arm link means. Camcase 14
      supports a central rotatable camshaft 15 which is attached to a
      three-lobe cam 13. Positioned on opposite sides of cam 13 is a
      pair of parallel follower arm links 16 with centrally located
      oblong holes 17 that provide clearance for camshaft 15. The
      opposite ends of the link pair are attached to a pair of follower
      pins 18 that carry a pair of cam followers 19 (track rollers).
      Follower pins 18 connect the cam followers and links to the
      pivoting ends of the pair of laterally-extending follower arms 20
      that extend outward on opposite sides of the follower arm link
      pair. Follower pin 18 also connects to piston rod 8b which
      connects to the wrist pin of piston 9. The opposite ends of the
      follower arms are attached to fixed pivot pins 7 for pivotally
      supporting the pivot ends of the arms to the camcase. A second
      piston rod and piston (not shown) can be connected to the lower
      follower pin 18 for providing a two-cylinder diametrically-opposed
      arrangement.<br>
      <br>
      For acceptable balance, the FIG. 6 configuration requires a
      one-lobe cam with shaft balancing weights. An alternative for good
      balance is a two-cylinder, horizontal-opposed engine which uses
      two parallel offset odd-lobe plate cams attached to camshaft 15
      with each cam having its own set of components (arms, links etc.).
      This odd-lobe dual cam configuration provides good dynamic balance
      similar to conventional horizontal-opposed engines. Offsetting
      inertia forces providing excellent dynamic balance can be achieved
      using one, three or five-lobe cams for three or more in-line rows.<br>
      <br>
      For an alternative arrangement, the links 16 can be connected to
      the follower arms at different positions. The follower arm can be
      extended beyond the piston rod pin for further flexibility. When
      increasing the width of the cam roller bearing to accommodate
      higher loading, the link pair can be extended to enable relocation
      of the arm and piston rod to a second pin independently above the
      roller bearing allowing additional space to accommodate the extra
      bearing width.<br>
      <br>
      In FIG. 7, there is shown a single-cylinder, odd-lobe cam, offset
      beam machine with opposed beams which is an alternative for the
      cam machine in FIG. 6. FIG. 7 is similar to FIG. 6 except the
      follower arms 20a are joined to balancing beam arms 21a at pivot
      pins 7a. The follower and beam arms comprise a pair of
      longitudinal opposite-direction extending rocker beams 22 with
      generally central pivotal axes that can be used for
      single-cylinder 10 or diametrically-opposed, two-cylinder (not
      shown) arrangements. Beam arms 21a include balancing weights 23
      which provide offsetting inertia force balance for the centrally
      located piston 9, piston rod 8c, link pair 16, followers 19 and
      arms 20a. The balancing rocker beams oscillate slightly out of
      parallel which cause a small imbalance that can be minimized by
      using longer follower arms. The beam pair oscillates in unison and
      harmonically which enables more than 95% dynamic balance for
      gasoline engines and compressors. Some advantages are very low
      vibration for a single-cylinder machine, simple structure, low
      cost and the option of using a one or three-lobe cam.<br>
      <br>
      In FIG. 8, there is shown a single row, in-line twin-cylinder 10a,
      cam beam arrangement which includes opposite-direction extending
      beams 22 &amp; 22a similar to FIG. 7. The upper beam 22a is
      connected at opposite ends to pistons 9a &amp; 9b. The upper beam
      arm 21b is connected to piston rod 8d by a piston rod pin 18b. Rod
      8d is connected to an additional outer piston 9b. This outer
      piston and balancing weight 23 provide dynamic balance for the
      centrally located piston 9a, rod 8e and other associated moving
      components. The FIG. 8 arrangement has less offsetting inertia
      forces than a diametrically-opposed, two-cylinder (not shown) beam
      arrangement because the outer piston 9b is used as an offsetting
      weight for the central components, thereby reducing inertia forces
      about 35%.<br>
      <br>
      An alternative sliding rod seal 39b (alternative to seals
      described in FIGS. 1B &amp; 5) is positioned around each rod 8d
      &amp; 8e, wherein each sliding seal is contained within the guide
      plate's 1f seal slot located in camcase head 1d'. For seals made
      of metal or hard plastic, a convex inner diameter seal surface is
      preferred to allow clearance for the slight rod oscillation. This
      will maintain a close circular contact between the seal and rod.<br>
      <br>
      For another alternative rod seal (shown in FIG. 8A), the seal's
      outer section is supported in a fixed position by the camcase (or
      crankcase). The seal's flexible inner section compensates for
      slight piston rod lateral movements while maintaining a snug fit
      around the rod.<br>
      <br>
      For 2-stroke applications, FIG. 8 provides low cost, low weight,
      low emissions and 180[deg.] alternating power strokes. This low
      vibration beam arrangement eliminates the poor balance typical of
      conventional in-line, twin-cylinder engines.<br>
      <br>
      In FIG. 9, there is shown a single-cylinder, lever arm cam beam
      arrangement including two beams 22b &amp; 22c with the upper beam
      22b configured to include the addition of lever arm 24. The lever
      arm beam 22b is comprised of lever arm 24 that extends outward
      from the follower and in an opposite direction from the adjoining
      follower arm 20c, beam arm 21c and balancing weight 23. The lever
      arm has a pinhole at its outer end that supports lever pin 25; pin
      25 is connected to the lower end of piston rod 8f that connects to
      piston 9. This mechanism can operate with an opposed lever arm
      beam and corresponding opposed rod and piston (not shown). FIG. 9
      includes balancing beam arms 21c &amp; 21d with balancing weights
      23 for providing dynamic balance.<br>
      <br>
      Relocating the lever pin 25 outward from the axis of the follower
      arm will increase piston dwell by changing the position of the
      "dwell arc" (ref. FIG. 2). Also, increasing the length of the
      lever arm 24 provides a longer stroke for additional power.
      Advantages of the FIG. 9 configuration (compared to FIG. 7) are
      compact size and less weight for a given stroke. For 2-stroke
      operation, FIG. 9 can be fitted with an under-piston pump or a
      charger cylinder 10c as illustrated in FIG. 15. Using three-lobe
      cam 13 eliminates a transmission for engine applications that
      operate compressors.<br>
      <br>
      For an alternative, beam arms 21c &amp; 21d can be eliminated to
      achieve compactness. This reconfigured version requires a one-lobe
      cam with counterweights and has more vibration, but results in
      less reciprocating forces on the roller cam followers.<br>
      <br>
      In FIG. 10, there is shown a four-cylinder, disk cam offset-beam
      arrangement. Similar to FIGS. 7-9, FIG. 10 uses offset balance
      beams 22a which consist of balancing beam arms 21b joined to cam
      follower arms 20b. Arranged with diametrically-opposed power
      cylinders 10 and a one-lobe cam 13a (three or five-lobe optional),
      this piston machine uses connecting rods 8g, pistons 9b and
      cylinders 10b for charging. Charger pistons 9b are positioned
      adjacent to diametrically-opposed pistons 9a. Piston rods 8b are
      connected at their lower end to follower pins 18 with the opposite
      end of rods 8b connected to opposed pistons 9a. Beam arms 21b have
      pinholes positioned at their outer ends for supporting a pair of
      piston rod pins 18b which are connected to the pair of piston rods
      8g.<br>
      <br>
      For longer piston dwell at TDC and improved fuel economy, the
      one-lobe disk cam's profile incorporates an asymmetrical design.
      The cam's track profile consists of a generally semicircular
      follower track surface 13d on one side of the disk cam and
      irregular raised track surface 13e on the opposite side of the
      cam. Camshaft 15 is generally located on the center line dividing
      the semicircular track surface 13d and the irregular track surface
      13e and offset towards the portion of the irregular track with the
      maximum raised surface 13g. Opposite camshaft 15 is located the
      top 13f of the cam lobe.<br>
      <br>
      When using charger cylinders 10b, the FIG. 10 cam mechanism
      provides simple structure and low cost for 2-stroke engines. As an
      option, this machine can operate with four power cylinders using
      under-piston scavenging pumps. This arrangement configured as a
      2-stroke engine provides more than 97% dynamic balance while
      achieving higher efficiencies when compared to 4-stroke,
      four-cylinder, conventional crankshaft engines. This beam
      arrangement also provides alternating power strokes, smooth torque
      and low cost.<br>
      <br>
      In FIG. 11, there is shown a four-cylinder, cam offset-beam
      arrangement that is similar to FIG. 10, but incorporates a
      five-lobe cam option for reducing the camshaft 15 rpm per cycle
      rate. For tiltrotor aircraft and helicopter applications, a
      five-lobe cam engine will eliminate reduction gears for powering a
      prop.<br>
      <br>
      The FIG. 11 five-lobe cam 13b profile is designed for near maximum
      piston dwell. However, the cylinder 10 position, as shown,
      provides additional piston dwell because the cylinder axis is
      generally tangent to the lower section 18c of the arc defined by
      the motion of the follower pin 18 (piston rod pin). A substantial
      increased piston dwell is achieved since piston rod 8b moves
      towards the cylinder axis during the downward stroke, thereby
      slowing the piston's downward movement. This total dwell increase
      is significantly more than prior art cam engines, yoke crankshaft
      engines and conventional crankshaft engines.<br>
      <br>
      For an opposed-piston (FIG. 11) or in-line twin-cylinder, cam beam
      (FIG. 8) configuration, sliding friction of the roller followers
      19 on the cam can be reduced by incorporating at least one
      slightly oblong link pinhole 18d. This allows longer continuous
      contact of the followers on the cam providing less slippage.<br>
      <br>
      In FIG. 12, there is shown an alternative three-cylinder,
      three-lobe cam (one or five-lobe optional) offset-beam machine. A
      first balancing beam arm 21b extends from the pivot end of a first
      link follower arm 20b providing a first rocker beam 22a having a
      central pivot axis 7a. A second balancing beam arm 21b extends
      from the pivot end of a second link follower arm providing a
      second rocker beam 22a' having a central pivot axis 7a. The first
      and second balancing rocker beams extend in generally opposite
      directions. The centrally located forked end (two prongs) of the
      first rocker beam 22a has a pinhole through each prong that the
      follower pin 18 (also, beam pin) passes through. The follower arm
      of the second rocker beam 22a' has two branches with each branch
      20d having a two-prong forked end. Each forked end has a pair of
      generally parallel track surfaces 20e forming a bearing slot with
      the track surfaces generally parallel to the longitudinal axis of
      the second rocker beam 22a'. Follower pin 18 also passes through
      links 16 and the pair of bearing slots within the forked ends;
      follower pin 18 reciprocates within the bearing slots as the beam
      22a' oscillates. Follower pin 18 connects to one end of piston rod
      8b, and the opposite end of piston rod 8b connects to centrally
      located piston 9a. To reduce friction, a pair of optional slot
      bearings 4 can be fitted around follower pin 18. Beam arms 21b are
      connected to the lower ends of piston rods 8g by piston rod pins
      18b with the opposite ends of rods 8g connected to pistons 9b.
      Pistons 9b are positioned on opposite sides of piston 9a providing
      an in-line arrangement.<br>
      <br>
      For alternative pin placements (not shown), a second pin can be
      placed above follower pin 18 relocating the beam pair and piston
      rod on an extended link pair. A third pin can be added to
      accommodate just the beam pair or an individual beam with the
      other beam connected to the rod pin. Or, each beam can be attached
      to the links by individual pins for four total pin replacements.
      Accordingly, the follower arm connected to the link pair opposite
      end can be attached by an additional pin placed outward from the
      roller follower.<br>
      <br>
      An alternative cylinder arrangement can be configured with one
      power piston connected to one of the beam arms with the opposite
      beam arm having an attached balancing weight. When arranged with
      only a centrally located power cylinder, balancing weights can be
      attached to both beam arms 21b to replace pistons 9b.<br>
      <br>
      The FIG. 12 machine is configured as a 2-stroke cycle internal
      combustion engine. For 4-stroke operation, a one-lobe cam is
      required. The centrally located cylinder 10 provides a charger for
      charging beam arm power cylinders 10b, although for some
      applications, cylinders 10b can be used to charge centrally
      located cylinder 10. As an option, under-piston pumps can be used
      for charging. For an alternative mechanism, a third and fourth
      rocker beam can be positioned on the opposite side of the cam
      opposing the first and second rocker beams for a six-cylinder
      arrangement. The advantages of FIG. 12 are compact design,
      excellent dynamic balance and low cost 2-stroke operation.<br>
      <br>
      In FIG. 12A, there is shown a top sectional view of FIG. 12.<br>
      <br>
      In FIG. 13, there is shown a modified FIG. 12 to include an
      additional pair of pistons 9b opposite the first pair of pistons
      9b. Each added piston is connected to its respective beam arm 21b
      and rocker beams 22a &amp; 22a'. A second charger cylinder 10 is
      positioned opposite the first charger cylinder 10 and connected to
      the opposite ends of links 16. The advantages of FIG. 13 are
      simple structure for six-cylinder arrangements, excellent dynamic
      balance and low cost 2-stroke operation.<br>
      <br>
      In FIG. 14, there is shown a 2-stroke cycle internal combustion
      engine of the double opposed-piston type which operates with two
      opposed cam 13 linkages-the same linkage discussed and illustrated
      in FIG. 12. The camshafts 15 of the opposed linkages are typically
      connected by a gear train (not shown). Cam linkages are connected
      to centrally located double opposed-pistons 9a &amp; 9b contained
      within their corresponding cylinders 10' &amp; 10b'.<br>
      <br>
      In FIG. 15, there is shown a four-cylinder, one-lobe disk cam 13a
      radial cylinder arrangement that requires camshaft counterweights.
      This linking arms mechanism includes a second pair of parallel
      links 16a that intersect at a 90[deg.] angle with the first pair
      of links 16. The second pair of links 16a is positioned outside
      the first pair 16. The opposite ends of links 16a are attached to
      a pair of follower pins 18 that are connected to a pair of opposed
      cam followers 19 and follower arms 20. For an alternative follower
      arm arrangement, adjacent follower arm pairs can be connected
      (siamesed) to the same pivot pin, thereby eliminating two pivot
      pins. Follower pins 18 connect to piston rods 8b that connect to
      pistons 9. This mechanism can also operate with semiradial
      three-cylinders or V-twin cylinders (not shown). There is the
      option of using charger cylinders 10c (shown for only one piston
      to illustrate) or under-piston scavenging pumps (not shown) for
      2-stroke operation. FIG. 15, in general, has lower vibration
      compared to conventional radials which have poor piston rod
      dynamic balance. For one or three-lobe cam applications, FIG. 15
      can be configured with four unit-rows to provide offsetting
      inertia forces for dynamic balance.<br>
      <br>
      In FIG. 16, there is shown an eight-cylinder radial, beam
      arrangement which includes two pairs of offset-beams positioned in
      the same rotary direction about one-lobe disk cam 13a. FIG. 16 is
      an extended version of FIG. 10, wherein two FIG. 10 configurations
      are arranged perpendicular without adding a second cam. For one,
      three or five lobe cams, the single row FIG. 16 arrangement has
      dynamic balance.<br>
      <br>
      In FIG. 17, there is shown a three-lobe cam, six-cylinder radial
      arrangement which operates with three intersecting pairs of
      parallel links 16, 16a &amp; 16b that link opposing followers,
      follower arms and pistons. This arrangement shows a
      self-supercharged, 2-stroke cycle engine operating with two
      opposed, single-acting charger cylinders 10d and four opposed
      power cylinders 10. Under-piston scavenging pumps (not shown) can
      be used as an alternative to the charger cylinders. Air transfer
      pipes 26 connect charger cylinders 10d to adjacent power cylinders
      10 while exhaust manifolds 27 are positioned between power
      cylinders 10. This piston machine can also operate as a
      semiradial, three-cylinder engine (not shown) consisting of two
      power pistons 9 that reciprocate in unison. As with the
      six-cylinder radial, cylinders 10 are charged by the centrally
      located third piston. For an alternative, converting this
      arrangement to a three power piston radial (wherein, replacing the
      charger cylinder with a power cylinder) allows the use of camcase
      compression, but with a significant loss in volumetric efficiency.
      A three-lobe cam is shown in FIG. 17 although a one-lobe cam can
      be used with under-piston scavenging pumps, or pulse bottles can
      be fitted to the charger cylinders 10d. The one-lobe cam requires
      camshaft counterweights for balance. Three-lobe cam arrangements
      provide offsetting reciprocating components for dynamic balance
      and do not require counterweights. For FIG. 17, both the one and
      three-lobe cam arrangements provide over 98% dynamic balance.<br>
      <br>
      In FIG. 18, there is shown a multicylinder cam beam alternative
      which operates with four rows (not shown) and four in-line banks
      of diametrically-opposed cylinders that provide offsetting inertia
      forces for dynamic balance. Centrally located two rows (not shown)
      reciprocate in the opposite direction relative to the two outside
      rows. The pairs of beams 22a oscillate generally parallel and
      directly opposed which allow this cam beam mechanism to provide
      approximately 99% dynamic balance. A one-lobe, five-lobe (both not
      shown) or three-lobe cam 13can be used in this arrangement to
      accommodate a variety of applications. As an alternative, follower
      arm links 16 can be relocated to the ends of beam arms 21b, but
      the preferable position is shown in FIG. 18. The FIG. 18
      arrangement promotes compact design and offers relatively easy
      access to components for inspection.<br>
      <br>
      Published test data have proven over the years that properly
      manufactured cam engines are reliable with long life intervals,
      and the wear on the cam and rollers due to sliding on the cam
      track is not significant. For 2-stroke, diametrically-opposed cam
      engines of the invention, cam followers have some sliding on the
      cam track near the top of the compression stroke at higher rpm.
      For very long life engine requirements, such as diesel
      applications, increasing the cam follower contact interval with
      the cam during the compression stroke will minimize "hop duration"
      and sliding wear. At least one end of the link pair pinholes can
      be slightly elongated (approx.0.003''-0.005'') in the longitudinal
      direction of the links to decrease roller follower hop. During the
      compression stroke, the adjusted link pinhole size allows the
      inertia forces to maintain roller follower contact with the cam,
      thereby minimizing follower sliding wear caused by unequal
      follower and cam track contact speeds.<br>
      <br>
      In FIGS. 19-21, there are shown crankshaft beam arrangements.
      Simple structure (single- throw crankshaft) and increased piston
      dwell characterize these machines when compared to prior art. For
      the crankshaft beam, FIGS. 19-20 are the best choices for
      compactness and low vibration for engines, compressors and pumps.<br>
      <br>
      In FIG. 19, there is shown another embodiment of the invention
      that is a three-cylinder, crankshaft offset-beam machine which is
      configured as a 2-stroke cycle internal combustion engine. Three
      in-line cylinders 10 &amp; 10b are attached to the crankcase. The
      centrally located cylinder 10 provides a charger for charging
      power cylinders 10b; although for some applications, cylinders 10b
      can be used to charge the centrally located cylinder 10, but
      results in orthodox rod angularity which causes decreased piston
      dwell. As an alternative, under-piston pumps can be used for
      charging cylinders. FIG. 19, as an option, can also be configured
      for 4-stroke operation.<br>
      <br>
      Balancing rocker beams 22a &amp; 22a' extend in generally opposite
      directions and are positioned on the upper side of the crankshaft.
      Fixed pivot pins 7a connect the beams generally central pivotal
      axes to the crankcase. A single-throw crankshaft 2 with counter
      weight 2' is rotatably mounted in the crankcase with the lower end
      of beam connecting rod 28 pivotally connected to crankpin 3. The
      upper end of rod 28 is pivotally connected to the centrally
      located ends of rocker beams 22a &amp; 22a' by a beam rod pin 18a.
      The centrally located forked end of the first beam 22a has a beam
      pinhole that the beam rod pin 18a passes through. The centrally
      located forked end of the second beam 22a' forms a bearing slot
      and a pair of parallel track surfaces 20e that beam rod pin 18a
      also passes through. The beam rod pin 18a reciprocates within the
      beam bearing slot in the general direction of the longitudinal
      axis of the second beam 22a'. The addition of slot bearing 4
      reduces sliding friction. The ends of rod beam arms 20b' &amp;
      20d' are connected to beam rod pin 18a by a siamesed connection,
      although an alternative side-by-side connection or a fork (two
      double pronged forks) type connection can be used. Beam rod pin
      18a connects to one end of piston rod 8h, and the opposite end of
      piston rod 8h connects to centrally located piston 9a which
      reciprocates within the centrally located cylinder 10. Piston rod
      pins 18b connect the lower ends of piston rods 8g to balancing
      beam arms 21b. The opposite ends of piston rods 8g are connected
      to outer pistons 9b which reciprocate within cylinders 10b. As
      options, the spacing of the piston rod 8h forked ends can be
      increased to fit on the outer ends of beam rod pin 18a, or beam
      rod 28 can be extended to allow a second pin placement (not shown)
      above pin 18a to separately connect piston rod 8h.<br>
      <br>
      For an alternative, a third and fourth rocker beam can be added to
      the opposite side of the crankshaft opposing the first and second
      rocker beams for a six-cylinder arrangement. A second beam rod 28
      connects the crankpin to the centrally located ends of the third
      and fourth rocker beams. This arrangement provides the advantages
      of very good dynamic balance and low cost.<br>
      <br>
      An alternative cylinder arrangement for FIG. 19, similar to the
      FIG. 13 cam machine, incorporates an additional piston connected
      to each end of beam arms 21b with the option of a corresponding
      second charger cylinder 10 with its piston connected to crankpin
      3. This six-cylinder arrangement provides simple structure, very
      good dynamic balance and low cost.<br>
      <br>
      Another cylinder arrangement can be a 2-stroke cycle engine of the
      double opposed-piston type similar to FIG. 14, except in FIG. 19,
      crankshafts are connected by a gear<br>
      <br>
      The FIG. 19 novel crankshaft beam machine has the desirable
      features of very good dynamic balance and increased piston dwell
      which promote fuel economies and reduced emissions. Optimum piston
      dwell is achieved when pistons 9b serve as power pistons. When
      piston 9a serves as a power piston, piston rod 8h pushes beam rod
      28 downward during combustion as in conventional engines causing
      orthodox beam rod 28 angularity and decreased piston dwell
      compared to dwell achieved through harmonic piston motion. In
      contrast, when outer pistons 9b serve as power pistons, beam rod
      28 and crankpin 3 conversely are at the bottom position during
      combustion resulting in slower piston 9b acceleration during the
      piston power stroke and increased dwell compared to dwell achieved
      through harmonic piston motion. When compared to prior art
      conventional crankshaft beam (or conventional crankshaft) engines,
      FIG. 19 power pistons 9b inherently have about 25% increased
      piston dwell. By optimizing the position of the cylinder axis
      relative to the arc (ref. FIG. 13 12a) that is defined by the
      motion of the piston rod pin 18b, an additional dwell increase of
      15% or more can be achieved for an overall dwell increase of more
      than 40%.<br>
      In FIG. 19A, there is shown a top sectional view of FIG. 19.<br>
      <br>
      In FIG. 20, there is shown an alternative single-cylinder,
      crankshaft offset-beam arrangement. A centrally located cylinder
      10 and two pivoting beams 22 &amp; 22' with attached balancing
      weights 23 make this low vibration, low cost arrangement ideally
      suited for small 4-stroke engine applications. A second piston can
      be connected to the end of one beam arm 21b' providing two power
      pistons for 4-stroke operation. For 2-stroke operation, a second
      piston can also be connected to one beam arm 21b' with either
      piston used as a charger or power piston. Also, under-piston
      pump(s) can be used for charging.<br>
      <br>
      In FIG. 21, there is shown an alternative four-cylinder,
      crankshaft offset-beam machine. Similar to FIG. 10, FIG. 21 uses a
      pair of offset balancing rocker beams 22a which consist of
      balancing beam arms 21b joined to rod beam arms 20b'. Beams 22a
      are attached to the crankcase at their central pivotal axes by
      fixed pivot pins 7a. Single-throw crankshaft 2 has its crankpin 3
      connected to opposite-direction extending beam rods 28 at their
      centrally located ends. Beam rod pins 18a connect the outer ends
      of the beam connecting rods 28 to the beam arms 20b' and piston
      rods 8h; these components all pivot about rod pins 18a. Beam rods
      28 can be connected to the crankpin 3 by a side-by-side, dual fork
      or siamesed connection.<br>
      <br>
      This crankshaft beam mechanism functionally operates somewhat
      similar to the cam beam mechanism (ref. FIG. 10) except for beam
      rod 28 angularity that causes secondary vibrations. Beam rod 28
      angularity causes beam arms' 21b rocking motion to be dissimilar
      resulting in a rocking imbalance and machine vibrations. This
      rocking imbalance is minimized when increasing rod 28 length or
      when operating with a plurality of rows which promote offsetting
      inertia forces improving the dynamic balance. Also, beam rods 28
      oscillate causing vibrations typical of conventional crankshaft
      machines. When using pistons 9b as power pistons, the FIG. 21
      machine has about the same amount of increased piston dwell
      advantage as the invention's FIG. 10 cam machine and the FIG. 19
      crankshaft arrangement. This translates to more than a 40% dwell
      increase when compared to conventional crankshaft beam or
      conventional crankshaft machines. Because of alternating power
      strokes, the FIG. 21 configuration provides the advantage of
      smooth torque.<br>
      <br>
      In FIGS. 22-25, there are shown self-supercharging and
      self-aspirated engine arrangements of the invention. For both
      2-stroke and 4-stroke cycle, each of these arrangements provide
      novel low-cost charging, crankcase air-fuel mixing, and the option
      of using crankcase oil or fuel-oil mist lubrication.<br>
      <br>
      In FIG. 22, there is shown a self-aspirated, 2-stroke cycle,
      two-cylinder diametrically-opposed engine. This configuration, an
      improvement compared to prior art, uses two pulse chambers for
      each cylinder consisting of an under-piston pump (pre-compression
      chamber) and a crankcase compression chamber.<br>
      <br>
      As shown, a carburetor 29 is connected to intake manifold 30 that
      connects to under-piston intake ports 31 (3&lt;rd &gt; port). The
      charge is drawn through intake ports 31 into two opposed
      under-piston pumps 32a (first chamber) by the upward stroke of
      pistons 9c. During the downward stroke, pumps 32a compress
      air-fuel through pump piston ports 33 (4th port) which are located
      opposite the intake manifold. Pump ports 33 join to reed valves 34
      from which the air-fuel charge flows through transfer pipes 35
      &amp; 35a to a crankcase compression chamber 36 (second chamber).
      This compressed air-fuel mixture, similar to conventional 2-stroke
      crankcase compression engines, is delivered from the crankcase
      compression chamber 36 through transfer ports 37 into the cylinder
      for combustion while assisting the exhaust flow through exhaust
      ports 38. Exhaust ports 38 can be repositioned for cross
      scavenging or relocated as exhaust poppet-valves in the heads. For
      a pump port 33 option,.the reed valves can be eliminated, but
      increased lengths for cylinders 10e and pistons are required.<br>
      <br>
      The FIG. 22 type of charging arrangement can also operate
      effectively with V or radial cylinder configurations. Turbulence
      within crankcase 1a provides excellent air-fuel mixing for lower
      emissions and increased fuel economy. Under-piston pumps 32a
      provide compressed air through the transfer pipes that enters the
      crankcase in the same direction as the crankcase circular flow
      promoting optimal charging and power.<br>
      <br>
      In FIG. 23, there is shown a self-supercharged, 4-stroke cycle,
      four-cylinder diametrically opposed engine. This engine, an
      improvement compared to prior art, is supercharged by in unison
      reciprocating, opposed twin-pistons, whereby each twin-piston
      under-piston pump unit compresses air or air-fuel as a single
      charging pump.<br>
      <br>
      As shown, an air intake filter or carburetor 29 is connected to
      intake manifold 30a that connects to under-piston intake ports 31
      (3&lt;rd &gt; port). Air or air-fuel is alternately drawn through
      intake ports 31 into twin-piston, under-piston pumps 32b during
      the upward strokes of pistons 9d. During the alternating downward
      strokes, the two opposed twin-piston pumps 32b alternately
      compress air or air-fuel through centrally located two opposed
      pairs of pump cylinder ports 40 (located at the bottom of pumps
      32b under-piston chamber) and through opposed twin-cylinder
      transfer ports 41 (located between the cylinders) to twin intake
      ports 42 located within cylinder heads 43. During each stroke, one
      of the four intake valves 44 opens allowing compressed air or
      air-fuel to flow into the associated combustion chamber 45. When
      using air-fuel-oil, an appropriate passage(s) through the
      crankcase head will allow mist lubrication, wherein replacing the
      crankcase oil lubrication system.<br>
      <br>
      These twin-piston charging pumps 32b have twice the volume
      displacement when compared to the intake stroke volume for each
      single cylinder, therefore during each two stroke, under-piston
      pumping cycle, air pressure and flow is greatly improved for
      alternately charging one cylinder at a time. Pump 32b will also
      operate with in-line twin, V-4 or V-8 and two row radial
      configurations. The advantages of the twin-piston high performance
      supercharger 32b are high volumetric efficiencies without the
      weight, space and cost associated with conventional superchargers.<br>
      <br>
      Another alternative twin-piston, under-piston pump arrangement
      provides single row engines that are arranged as a V-type or
      radial engine having one or more V-twin cylinders (ideally with
      the twin cylinders positioned close together), but this one row
      arrangement will have reduced pump efficiency. This reduced
      efficiency is caused by the lower pump pressures that result from
      twin-pistons which are not reciprocating simultaneously.<br>
      <br>
      For other 4-stroke arrangements, such as in-line type or V-type,
      under-piston pump 32b can be replaced by crankcase compression for
      providing the advantage of crankcase air-fuel-oil mixing, but with
      less power gain than FIG. 23. For options, various combinations of
      single-cylinders and/or in-line twin-cylinders with crankcase pump
      units can be used to provide different multicylinder arrangements.<br>
      <br>
      In FIG. 24, there is shown a self-supercharged, 4-stroke cycle
      single-cylinder engine. Intake port 31a provides induction of the
      charge into under-piston pump 32a. The charge is then compressed
      through pump port 33, reed valve 34 and transfer pipe 35 into
      crankcase 1b. During the engine intake stroke, the compressed
      charge passes from crankcase 1b through single transfer port 41 a
      into cylinder head intake port 42a, through intake valve 44 and
      into cylinder 10g for combustion. Because of two under-piston
      compression strokes for every engine intake stroke, there is
      greatly improved supercharging.<br>
      <br>
      As an alternative, FIG. 24 can be converted to 4-stroke crankcase
      compression by removing seal 39, seal guide plate, reed valve 34
      and transfer pipe 35, but at reduced volumetric efficiency.
      Various multicylinder in-line and V-type arrangements can be
      configured.<br>
      <br>
      In FIG. 25, there is shown a self-aspirated, 2-stroke cycle
      single-cylinder engine which includes a double chamber consisting
      of an under-piston pump and crankcase that are interconnected by
      intake T-manifold 46. T-manifold 46 interconnects carburetor 29 to
      crankcase 1c and to one (as shown) or more under-piston pumps 32.
      Carburetor 29 connects to check valve 34 which is attached to the
      intake of T-manifold 46. The T-manifold intake begins at main
      passage 47 with the main passage outlet connected to under-piston
      intake port 31 (3&lt;rd &gt; port) of pump 32. A first crankcase
      passage 48 interconnects the T-manifold's main passage 47 to
      crankcase 1c, whereby the T-manifold provides interconnecting
      passages for delivering air-fuel from the carburetor and crankcase
      to under-piston pump 32. Crankcase passage 48 is aligned such to
      allow the rotating crankshaft to boost charge into T-manifold,
      thereby permitting more air-fuel flow into pump 32 during the
      pump's intake stroke.<br>
      <br>
      The simplest T-manifold consists of main passage 47 and first
      crankcase passage 48. For under-piston pump applications, the
      T-manifold provides improved volumetric efficiencies. To increase
      the charge flow to pump 32 by the rotating crankshaft, a second
      crankcase passage 49 (optional) can be added to improve air-fuel
      flow into the crankcase by creating a loop effect between passages
      48 and 49. As shown in FIG. 25A, a semicircle passage 50 within
      the T-manifold will assist the loop flow into passage 48 and out
      of passage 49 after closure of the pump intake port 31. This
      results in reduced turbulence and controlled flow between the
      crankcase and T-manifold and improves the flow of the charge
      through main passage 47 when intake port 31 is open as shown in
      FIG. 25.<br>
      <br>
      When using crankcase oil lubrication, only air passes in-and-out
      of the crankcase, whereby direct fuel injection or other fuel
      supply systems can be used. An advantage of the FIG. 25
      arrangement is the option of using either an air-fuel-oil mist or
      oil lubrication system for under-piston pump engines.<br>
      <br>
      Test results show that the combination of under-piston pump,
      crankcase and T-manifold provides: (1) improved volumetric
      efficiencies and (2) reduced emissions and improved fuel economy
      for under-piston pump applications as facilitated by the air-fuel
      mixing action of the rotating crankshaft.<br>
      <br>
      Some Notable Advantages and Applications of the Invention: The
      high mechanical and fuel efficiencies for 2 &amp; 4-stroke engines
      provided by the invention result in less engine weight and fewer
      emissions compared to prior art engines. The substantial
      improvements described in this specification allow the 2-stroke
      engine to replace the heavier and more expensive 4-stroke for many
      applications. For example, because of lower cost, lower weight,
      increased reliability and the smaller frontal area typical of
      2-stroke engines vs. the 4-stroke, 2-stroke configurations of the
      invention become ideal for some aircraft applications. Since the
      invention's three-lobe cam mechanism provides a power shaft rpm
      reduction equivalent to a 3:1 gear ratio, eliminating
      transmissions becomes feasible for: (1) engines operating
      compressors and generators (2) inboard boat engines and (3)
      helicopters, tiltrotor and fixed wing aircraft engines. When
      operating with at least two power cylinders for each unit-row and
      as a 2-stroke, self-supercharged gasoline engine (at the same
      nominal cycle rates as conventional reciprocating engines), unit
      weights of less than 0.7 lb. per hp are achievable for the
      invention. This is less than one-half the weight of conventional
      horizontal-opposed 4-stroke aircraft engines for the same hp.
      Configured as a 2-stroke, six-cylinder radial aircraft engine,
      less than 0.5 lb. per hp is achievable. Also, because of
      substantially increased piston dwell, higher rpm and shorter
      strokes are possible which further reduces the weight to power
      ratio.<br>
      <br>
      Invention's Fuel Efficiencies: When configured for optimum fuel
      efficiency, test results indicate that fuel consumption is
      approximately 0.22 lb. per hp hr. When comparing the invention's
      2-stroke gasoline engine to the conventional 4-stroke gasoline
      engine, some projected fuel economy improvement factors are 1.5
      for automobile engines and 1.35 for aircraft engines. Compared to
      the large truck 4-stroke, low rpm conventional diesel engine, a
      factor of 1.5 fuel economy improvement is projected. For diesel
      automobiles, a factor of 2.0 improvement is projected.<br>
      <br>
