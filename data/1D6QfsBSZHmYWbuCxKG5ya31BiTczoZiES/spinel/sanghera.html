        <i>Imagine</i> a glass window that's tough like armor, a camera
        lens that doesn't get scratched in a sand storm, or a smart
        phone that doesn't break when dropped. Except it's not glass,
        it's a special ceramic called spinel {spin-ELL} that the U.S.
        Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) has been researching over the
        last 10 years.<br>

        <br>
        Dr. Jas Sanghera and colleagues at the U.S. Naval Research
        Laboratory (NRL) invented a new way of making transparent
        spinel. "The advantage [of spinel] is it's so much tougher,
        stronger, harder than glass," says Sanghera. "For
        weight-sensitive platforms—UAVs [unmanned autonomous vehicles],
        head-mounted face shields—it's a game-changing technology."
        Spinel also could be used for watches and consumer electronics,
        like the smart phone. (Photo: U.S. Naval Research

        <br>
        "Spinel is actually a mineral, it's magnesium aluminate," says
        Dr. Jas Sanghera, who leads the research. "The advantage is it's
        so much tougher, stronger, harder than glass. It provides better
        protection in more hostile environments — so it can withstand
        sand and rain erosion."<br>
        <br>
        As a more durable material, a thinner layer of spinel can give
        better performance than glass. "For weight-sensitive
        platforms-UAVs [unmanned autonomous vehicles], head-mounted face
        shields — it's a game-changing technology."<br>
        <br>
        NRL invented a new way of making transparent spinel, using a hot
        press, called sintering. It's a low-temperature process, and the
        size of the pieces is limited only by the size of the press.
        "Ultimately, we're going to hand it over to industry," says
        Sanghera, "so it has to be a scalable process." In the lab, they
        made pieces eight inches in diameter. "Then we licensed the
        technology to a company who was able then to scale that up to
        much larger plates, about 30-inches wide."<br>
        <br>
        The sintering method also allows NRL to make optics in a number
        of shapes, "conformal with the surface of an airplane or UAV
        wing," depending on the shape of the press.<br>
        <br>
        In addition to being tougher, stronger, harder, Sanghera says
        spinel has "unique optical properties; not only can you see
        through it, but it allows infrared light to go through it." That
        means the military, for imaging systems, "can use spinel as the
        window because it allows the infrared light to come through."<br>
        <br>
        NRL is also looking at spinel for the windows on lasers
        operating in maritime and other hostile environments. "I've got
        to worry about wave slap and saltwater and things like that, and
        gun blasts going off—it's got to be resistant to all that. And
        so that's where spinel comes into its own," says Sanghera.<br>
        <br>
        Says Sanghera, "Everything we do, we're trying to push the
        mission. It's designed to either enable a new application, a new
        capability — or enhance an existing one."<br>

        <b>What is spinel?</b><br>

        <i>Spinel pressed into rectangle</i> -- The U.S. Naval Research
        Laboratory uses a hot press to make spinel into conformable
        optics, like this flat sheet. "Ultimately, we're going to hand
        it over to industry," says Dr. Jas Sanghera, who leads the
        research, "so it has to be a scalable process." In the lab, they
        made pieces eight inches in diameter. "Then we licensed the
        technology to a company who was able then to scale that up to
        much larger plates, about 30-inches wide." (Photo: U.S. Naval
        Research Laboratory/Jamie Hartman)<br>
        <br>
        Spinel can be mined as a gemstone; a famous example is the Black
        Prince's Ruby, which is actually spinel with a color dopant. NRL
        chemists have also synthesized their own ultra-high purity
        spinel powder, and other synthetic versions are commercially
        available. "The precursors are all earth abundant, so it's
        available in reasonably low cost," says Sanghera.<br>
        <br>
        The spinel NRL makes is a polycrystalline material, or a lot of
        crystal particles all pressed together. Whereas with glass, "A
        crack that forms on the surface will go all the way through,"
        spinel might chip but it won't crack. "It's like navigating
        through the asteroid belt, you create a tortuous path: if I have
        all these crystals packed together, the crack gets deflected at
        the hard crystals: you dissipate the crack energy."<br>
        <br>
        <b>A manufacturing process that's transferable and scalable</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        When scientists first started trying to make glass-like spinel,
        they were using a crucible instead of a press. "A big problem
        with growing crystals is that you have to melt the starting
        powder at very high temperatures, over 2000 degrees Celsius,"
        says Sanghera. It's expensive to heat a material that high, and
        additionally, "the molten material reacts with the crucible, and
        so if you're trying to make very high quality crystals, you end
        up [with a] huge amount of defects."<br>
        <br>
        That's why Sanghera and his colleagues turned to sintering. "You
        put the powder in [a hot press], you press it under vacuum,
        squash this powder together—and if you can do that right, then
        you can get rid of all the entrapped air, and all of a sudden it
        comes out of there clear-looking."<br>

        <i>Hot press in NRL spinel lab</i> -- The U.S. Naval Research
        Laboratory uses a hot press to make spinel, a process called
        sintering. It’s much less expensive than melting, and the size
        of the pieces is limited only by the size of the press. Says
        lead researcher Dr. Jas Sanghera, "You put the powder in [a hot
        press], you press it under vacuum, squash this powder
        together—and if you can do that right, then you can get rid of
        all the entrapped air, and all of a sudden it comes out of there
        clear-looking." To further increase the quality of the optic,
        "You can grind and polish this just like you would do gems."
        (Photo: U.S. Naval Research Laboratory/Jamie Hartman)<br>
        <br>
        If the press has flat plates, the spinel will come out flat.
        "But if I have a ball and socket joint, put the powder in there,
        I end up with a dome shape," says Sanghera, "so we can make near
        net shape product that way."<br>
        <br>
        NRL was not the first to try sintering. But previous attempts
        had yielded "a window [where] most of it would look cloudy, and
        there would be an odd region here and there—about an inch or
        so—that was clear, and that would be core-drilled out."<br>
        <br>
        So NRL deconstructed the science. They started with purer
        chemicals. "Lousy chemicals in, lousy material out," says
        Sanghera.<br>
        <br>
        Then they discovered a second problem, with the sintering aid
        they were adding to the spinel powder. "It's about one percent
        of a different powder, in this case lithium fluoride," says
        Sanghera. This "pixie dust" is meant to melt and "lubricate the
        powder particles, so there's less friction, so they can all move
        together during sintering." They were putting the powders
        together in shakers overnight, but, "The thing is, on a scale of
        the powder, it's never mixed uniformly."<br>
        <br>
        Understanding the problem led to a unique solution for enabling
        uniform mixing. Now, "there's only one pathway for
        densification," and the spinel will come out clear across the
        press.<br>
        <br>
        To further increase the quality of the optic, "You can grind and
        polish this just like you would do gems," says Sanghera. This is
        the most costly part of the process. "One of the things we're
        looking at is, how do we reduce the finishing cost?" The surface
        of the press is imprinted onto the glass. "If we can improve
        upon that," he says, "make that mirror finished, then—and so
        that's where we get into a little bit of IP [intellectual
        property], is what's the best way to do that?"<br>
        <br>
        For both the Department of Defense (DoD) and private industry,
        "Cost is a big driver, and so it's important for us to make
        product that can be affordable."<br>
        <br>
        <b>Unique applications for military and commercial use</b><br>
        <br>
        "There are a lot of applications," says Sanghera. He mentions
        watches and consumer electronics, like the smart phone, as
        examples.<br>
        <br>
        The military in particular may want to use spinel as transparent
        armor for vehicles and face shields. A "bullet-proof" window
        today, for example, has layers of plastic and glass perhaps five
        inches thick. "If you replaced that with spinel, you'd reduce
        the weight by a factor of two or more," says Sanghera.<br>
        <br>
        The military's also interested in using spinel to better protect
        visible and infrared cameras on planes and other platforms.
        Glass doesn't transmit infrared, so today's optics are made of
        "exotic materials that are very soft and fragile," and have
        multiple layers to compensate for color distortions. "So that's
        what we've been doing now, developing new optical materials,"
        says Sanghera. Spinel windows could also protect sensors on
        space satellites, an area Sanghera's interested in testing.<br>
        <br>
        "You could leave these out there for longer periods of time, go
        into environments that are harsher than what they're
        encountering now, and enable more capabilities," he says."<br>

        The U.S. Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) is making transparent
        ceramics, called spinel, that could one day replace the glass in
        military imaging systems. In maritime and other hostile
        environments, "I've got to worry about wave slap and saltwater
        and things like that, and gun blasts going off," says optical
        scientist Dr. Jas Sanghera. "And so that's where spinel comes
        into its own." In addition to being tough, spinel has "unique
        optical properties; […] it allows the infrared light to come
        through." (Photo: U.S. Navy/Mass Communication Specialist 2nd
        Class Michael Russell)<br>
        <br>
        NRL is also looking at spinel (and other materials) for next
        generation (NEXTGEN) lasers. "Lasers can be thought of as a box
        comprised of optics," he says. "There's passive and there's
        active components: passive is just a protective window; active
        is where we change the color of light coming out the other end."<br>
        <br>
        For passive laser applications, like exit apertures (windows),
        the key is high quality. "That window, if it's got any
        impurities or junk, it can absorb that laser light," says
        Sanghera. "When it absorbs, things heat up," which can cause the
        window to break. Sanghera and his colleagues have demonstrated,
        working with "ultra high purity" spinel powder they've
        synthesized in NRL clean rooms, spinel's incredible potential.<br>
        <br>
        For active laser applications, they've demonstrated how
        sintering can be used with materials other than spinel to make a
        laser that's "excellent optical quality." Instead of spinel,
        they use, "things like yttria or lutecia [and] and dope them
        with rare earth ions."<br>
        <br>
        NRL has transitioned both types of laser materials and
        applications to industry.<br>
        <br>
        <b>What makes NRL tick is solving problems</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        Sanghera came to NRL in 1988, after completing his PhD at the
        Imperial College, London in materials science. "Little by
        little—talking to people, asking questions, going to
        conferences—you find out that what makes this place tick is
        solving problems," he says. "No two days are the same, it's very
        exciting."<br>
        <br>
        <div align="center"><img alt="" src="dome.jpg" height="247"

        <i>Spinel pressed into a dome</i>T -- he U.S. Naval Research
        Laboratory (NRL) presses spinel powder into transparent domes,
        sheets, and other shapes. "For weight-sensitive platforms—UAVs,
        head-mounted face shields—it's a game-changing technology," says
        Dr. Jas Sanghera, who leads the research. If the press has flat
        plates, the spinel will come out flat. "But if I have a ball and
        socket joint, put the powder in there, I end up with a dome
        shape." (Photo: U.S. Naval Research Laboratory/Jamie Hartman)<br>
        <br>
        He first worked with glass, drawing it into optical fibers, and
        a lot of his success with spinel comes from that heritage of
        insisting on purity and quality. "An optical fiber's very long:
        it can go from 1 meter to 100s of kilometers. Purity's very
        important, because if there's any junk in there, the light will
        either be absorbed or it can be scattered."<br>
        <br>
        His lab also makes lightweight, inexpensive fibers for infrared
        countermeasures applications on helicopters and other platforms.
        By weaving it through the platform, "This fiber can remote the
        energy from the laser, which is inside the platform, to a device
        on the outside, which can then track and then shoot the laser
        beam out, confuse the missile."<br>
        <br>
        He acknowledges, "In DoD, we are the premier place for
        development of fiber lasers. It's something we are heavily
        involved with, all the different types of fibers and
        configurations and materials required to enable these eye-safer
        and NEXTGEN lasers."<br>
        <br>
        Sanghera says that there's evolution, like enhancing an existing
        capability by improving size, weight, and performance/power
        (SWAP); "But revolution is when you come up with some new idea,
        you just enabled completely new capabilities." For that, he
        credits the many different disciplines NRL brings together. "We
        have a lot of smart people, we have a lot of what I call
        head-banging sessions, where we discuss new ideas and
        opportunities. If you don't ask the questions, you won't get
        answers and you won't stimulate new ideas."<br>
        <br>
        He also credits a close relationship with industry and with
        those NRL serves. "We talk to the warfare centers, the systems
        people—so that what you're doing really is going to be of value.
        There's already the application there in mind, and we're just
        trying to solve that problem; so it's very focused in that
        sense."<b><br>

        This invention pertains to product and process. The product is a
        transparent product of a density in excess 99.5% comprising
        spinel and having uniform mechanical properties. The process
        pertains to fabrication of a transparent spinel product
        comprising the steps of dissolving a sintering aid in water to
        form a neutral sintering aid solution, adding a suitable
        additive to the sintering aid solution, applying the sintering

        sub-dividing or atomizing the spinel dispersion to form droplets
        comprising one or more spinel particles coated with the final
        spinel solution, drying the droplets to form dried coated
        particles comprising one or more spinel particles coated with a
        dried layer of the sintering aid, and densifying the dried
        coated particles to form a transparent spinel product having,
        uniform optical and mechanical properties in absence of grains
        of exaggerated size.<br>

        <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
        </b><b><br>
        </b><b>1. Field of the Invention</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        This invention pertains to the field of sintered ceramics,
        particularly magnesium aluminum spinel, and to a process for
        preparing sintered ceramic articles from ceramic powders.<br>
        <br>
        <b>2. Description of Related Art</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        Sintering is defined as the act of consolidating powder into a
        dense shape. The powder being sintered must additionally not
        melt to a great extent, some melting of secondary phases in the
        powder, or surface melting is allowed under this definition. If
        the material completely melts, the process is referred to as
        fusion casting. Sintering, both presureless and with pressure,
        or hot pressing, requires solid, liquid or gas material
        transport to consolidate an aggregate of loose powder particles
        into a dense shape. In the case of porcelains and clay products,
        secondary phases do melt and “glue” the primary solid particles
        together with a glassy phase. These types of systems were the
        first to be used due to their ease of sintering. However,
        advanced ceramics do not have these intrinsic sintering aids and
        they must therefore, be added. For small samples, the powdered
        sintering aids are mixed with the powder to be sintered with a
        mortar and pestle. In larger samples, mixing is accomplished by
        ball milling, attritor milling, high shear wet milling, and
        variations or combinations of these methods.<br>
        <br>
        Spinel is defined as a crystalline structure of the type AB2O4
        where A is a 2+ cation occupying tetrahedral lattice site in an
        oxygen cubic close packed structure and B is a 3+ cation
        occupying octahedral lettice site. In a preferred embodiment,
        spinel is MgAl2O4 consisting of an oxide of magnesium and
        aluminum. Spinel powder can be prepared by wet chemistry, solid
        state diffusion of oxides or calcination. Spinel powder
        particles consist of crystallites which are less than 500 nm in
        size that can also be agglomerated into larger sizes varying
        from 500 nm to 100 µm, more typically 1-50 µm.<br>
        <br>
        Spinel is important because it is strong and transparent from
        visible to 5.5 µm wavelength. Its mechanical properties are
        several times greater than that of glass and make it a leading
        candidate for use as a transparent armor and window material.
        Commercially, it can be used as a stronger and thinner window
        for many applications including lap top computers, cell phones,
        automotive glassing and headlamps, aerospace windshields, and
        industrial blast shields.<br>
        <br>
        Dense, transparent spinel articles are not currently available
        from a commercial source although there are companies currently
        trying to develop a viable manufacturing process. Since there is
        no viable manufacturing process, the cost of spinel products is
        so high that even the military avoids its use.<br>
        <br>
        Difficult to sinter materials, such as spinel, are typically
        mixed with a sintering aid or a secondary material that aids in
        densification. The sintering aids work in a variety of fashions.
        The sintering aids may liquefy at or somewhat below the primary
        material's densification temperature thereby promoting liquid
        phase sintering. Certain sintering aid materials exhibit higher
        solid-state diffusion coefficients than the primary material's
        self-diffusion coefficient. The secondary material may
        conversely have a lower solid-state diffusion coefficient that
        prevents exaggerated grain growth and promotes grain boundary
        refinement and pinning. The sintering aid may also simply clean
        or etch the primary material's surfaces thereby enhancing
        solid-state diffusion. These are broad examples of the
        mechanisms by which sintering aids enhance densification. In
        actual practice, sintering aids may not fit into just one of the
        categories outlined and the same aid may have different
        functions in different material systems, or have no effect in
        other systems.<br>
        <br>
        Sintering aids tend to be solid inorganic particles at room
        temperature. Sintering aid particles henceforth are defined as
        comprising crystallites (?500 nm), crystals (&gt;500 nm), and
        agglomerates of crystallites and/or crystals. Since the
        materials to be densified are generally also solid inorganic
        particles, the two materials must be mixed homogeneously for the
        sintering aid to be effective. This is accomplished by some form
        of mechanical mixing. However, due to the nature of
        particle-particle interactions, the mixture is far from
        homogeneous. Inhomogeneity in the mixture results in areas that
        have too much sintering aid and other areas that have little or
        no sintering aid. This is a major problem in the fabrication of
        transparent ceramics, electronic ceramics, and in high tech
        refractory ceramics.<br>
        <br>
        The Sellers et al U.S. Pat. No. 3,768,990 discloses an optical
        element having transparency in the visible and infrared wave
        lengths that is made by heating at an elevated temperature a
        composition having sub-micron particle size of magnesium oxide
        and aluminum oxide having uniformly mixed therethrough 0.2-4% by
        weight of powdered LiF. It is believed that optical and
        mechanical properties of the Seller's optical element are
        negatively impacted by the inhomogeneous presence of substantial
        amount of LiF. This leads to microstructural regions that are
        highly porous and other microstructural regions that exhibit
        exaggerated grain growth, all of which lead to inferior optical
        and mechanical properties. This has prevented the use of spinel
        in practical applications since the Seller's patent issued in
        1973. Furthermore, it is believed that the atomic concentrations
        of lithium and fluorine will be greater than about 1000 ppm and
        100 ppm, respectively due to the fact that LiF is well known to
        react with alumina, which Seller's uses as a starting powder.<br>

        <b>OBJECTS AND BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        It is an object of this invention to make spinel products or
        products that contain spinel that are moderately priced.<br>
        <br>
        It is another object of this invention to increase transmission
        of spinel products from about 5% at 0.525 µm, which is
        relatively opaque, to at least 50% at 0.525 µm, which is
        transparent.<br>
        <br>
        It is another object of this invention to eliminate or reduce
        the Hot Isostatic Pressing (HIP) procedure in the fabrication of
        the spinel products.<br>
        <br>
        Another object of this invention is the more uniform
        distribution of the sintering aid on the spinel particles.<br>
        <br>
        Another object of this invention is to increase densification of
        sintered spinel products beyond 99.8%.<br>
        <br>
        Another object of this invention is the more complete and more
        uniform covering on surfaces of the spinel particles by a
        sintering aid which is achieved by dissolving the sintering aid
        in a solvent to create a sintering aid solution and then adding
        the spinel particles in the sintering aid solution to form a
        dispersion, also referred to as a ceramic dispersion.<br>
        <br>
        These and other objects of this invention can be achieved by a
        transparent spinel product that is fabricated by sintering and
        densifying spinel powder in absence of the HIP procedure by
        dissolving a sintering aid in a solvent to form a sintering aid
        solution, adding spinel particles in the sintering aid solution
        to form a dispersion, maintaining the dispersion in a state
        which discourages precipitation of the solid sintering aid,
        spray-drying the dispersion to form spinel particles coated with
        a sintering aid, and densifying the coated spinel particles to
        form a transparent product.<br>

        </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        This invention pertains to a sintered and transparent spinel
        product and to a process for making it which is characterized by
        spraying a dispersion consisting of spinel particles in a
        sintering aid solution to form spinel particles coated with the
        sintering aid. The sintering aid coating on the spinel particles
        need not be continuous, although it should be sufficient to
        prevent a large number of sites where the particles contact each
        other without an intervening layer of a sintering aid.<br>
        <br>
        The sintered and densified spinel product of this invention is
        novel and unobvious when compared to prior art. Preparation of a
        spinel product by prior art procedure yields a product that is
        not transparent but opaque afrer hot pressing and requires
        extended HIPing to render the product transparent, however, with
        consequent loss of optical and mechanical properties. To explain
        more fully, the prior art product can be made transparent by
        extending the HIPing procedure beyond the customary period of on
        the order of a day, however, prolonging the hot processing
        and/or the HIPing procedure introduces exaggerated grain growth
        which renders the resulting product non-uniform in terms of
        optical and mechanical properties such as elastic modulus,
        flexure strength and fracture toughness, properties which are
        paramount for spinel character. The novel and unobvious product,
        made in absence of the HIP procedure, as described herein, is
        transparent over the wavelength range of about 0.3-5.5 µm, has
        uniform optical and mechanical properties and its grains are
        smaller than about 1 mm, typically smaller than about 500 µm.
        The spinel product of this invention does not have the
        exaggerated grain growth or is essentially devoid of grains of
        exaggerated size. There are no grains larger than about 1 mm.
        Exaggerated grain growth typically leads to grains that are
        greater than 3 times larger to several orders of magnitude
        larger than an average sized grain. Transparency of the spinel
        product of this invention, made in the manner disclosed herein
        and in absence of the HIP procedure, is above about 50% and up
        to about 90%.<br>
        <br>
        In the preparation of the sintered spinel product of this
        invention, the sintering aid, such as LiF or any other suitable
        sintering aid such as NaCl, NaF, LiCl, etc., is dissolved in a
        suitable solvent, typically water, to form a sintering aid
        solution. The sintering aid can be in any condition, however, it
        is typically particulate with particle sizes in the range of 500
        nm-10 µm. This, of course, is not important because the
        sintering aid is eventually dissolved to form a sintering aid
        solution. To enhance spraying of the sintering aid solution,
        ethanol or isopropanol or another suitable diluent is admixed
        with the aqueous sintering aid solution to form a modified
        sintering solution, which henceforth is referred as the
        sintering aid solution. Aqueous solution of LiF by itself is not
        readily sprayable using an ultrasonic atomizer in absence of a
        low surface tension/viscosity liquid component, which is
        typically a suitable additive, such as an alcohol. The
        overriding consideration in adding another component to water is
        to enhance solubility of the sintering aid and the sprayability
        of the modified sintering aid solution. If the sintering aid is
        other than LiF, other component(s) known to a person skilled in
        the art may be used. A typical sintering aid solution is
        prepared by admixing 0.2 g LiF sintering aid, 220 ml water, and
        780 ml ethanol or another like component. Typically, the ratio
        of the components is on this order of magnitude. The sintering
        aid solution should not contain too much sintering aid, such as
        about in excess of about 10% by weight.<br>
        <br>
        Coating of the spinel particles can be effected in any desired
        manner in order to deposit a uniform layer of the sintering aid
        on the particles. The sintering aid coating can be applied onto
        the spinel particles in any suitable manner such as in a
        fluidized bed, by a wet chemistry technique, by CVD, plasma
        enhanced CVD, laser assisted deposition, by sputtering, by an
        evaporation technique, and the like. The coating need not be
        continuous, but should be sufficient to prevent a large number
        of sites where the particles contact each other without an
        intervening layer of a sintering aid material. Spraying of the
        final sintering aid solution can also be used to deposit at
        least a monolayer of the sintering aid on the spinel particles.
        Another way of accomplishing this objective is simply to immerse
        the spinel particles in the final sintering aid solution until
        the spinel particles acquire a coating of the sintering aid of
        sufficient thickness and sufficient uniformity.<br>
        <br>
        The sintering aid solution is maintained in a state where it is
        on the spinel particles and the sintering aid is in solution and
        not precipitated on the spinel particles. This may require
        adjustment of temperature, pH, and/or another parameter(s) to
        discourage precipitation of the sintering aid on the particle
        surface. If the sintering aid is LiF, precipitation thereof can
        be discouraged or prevented by maintaining a neutral pH of about
        7 of the sintering aid solution.<br>
        <br>
        The spinel particles are typically in the range of 500 nm to 100
        µm and amount of the sintering aid on the spinel particles is
        typically 0.05-10% on weight basis, more typically 0.1-2% by
        weight of the spinel particles. FIG. 1 is illustrative of the
        coating process and shows spinel particles 12 coated with
        sintering aid 14, sintered to produce product 16. Spinel
        particles must be insoluble in mixtures of water and the
        additives used.<br>
        <br>
        The dispersion resulting when spinel particles are mixed with
        the sintering aid solution is delivered to an atomizer where the
        dispersion is sprayed, causing sub-division into droplets which
        are transported into a drying zone where vaporizable matter is
        removed from the droplets and the solid coating is formed
        thereon. The droplet size can be up to 1000 µm but is typically
        up to 500 µm, more typically 5 nm to 250 µm, and especially 50
        nm to 50 µm. Any suitable atomizer can be used, including
        mechanical, piezoelectric (ultrasonic) and electrostatic, as
        long as droplets containing the desired number of spinel
        particles are formed and the preponderance of resulting coated
        droplets are completely or hermetically sealed or coated.<br>
        <br>
        Whatever atomizer is used, chemistry of the dispersion should be
        such as to prevent premature precipitation of the coating on the
        spinel particles, and the droplets issuing from the atomizer
        should contain at least one of the spinel particles per droplet.
        Typically, an ultrasonic atomizer is used at a variable
        frequency since size of a droplet can be controlled by varying
        atomizer frequency. For instance, at atomizer frequency of 20
        kHz, droplets of about 90 µm can be formed; at frequency of 40
        kHz, droplets of about 45 µm can be formed; and at 80 kHz,
        droplets of about 20 µm can be formed. As is apparent, the
        inverse relationship between atomizer frequency and the droplet
        size can be used to control the droplet size.<br>
        <br>
        The higher the temperature in the drying zone, the shorter
        residence time is required of the droplets in the zone to have
        the vaporizable matter removed from and the coating formed
        thereon. The temperature in the zone should be high enough to
        drive-off volatile matter from the particles but not so high as
        to impart thermal damage to the particles or the coating.
        Furthermore, temperature in the zone should be high enough to
        drive-off volatiles from the droplets in a reasonable or desired
        time, which can be adjusted by changing temperature in the zone,
        with higher temperature in the zone reducing residence time of
        the droplets to form dry, coated particles. Typically, depending
        on many factors, temperature in the drying zone should be in
        excess of about 100° C. and below 600° C., more typically 200°
        C.-500° C.; and speed of the droplets through the drying zones
        in the droplet direction is typically 0.1-1000 cm/sec, more
        typically 50-500 cm/sec. When moving in the zone, the droplets
        are entrained in hot air or in an inert gas or a reactive gas.
        Residence time in the zone is instantaneous to a fraction of a
        minute, typically 0.1-10 seconds.<br>
        <br>
        FIG. 2 illustrates a preferred spray drying system 210 composed
        of a pair of 5-foot long silica tubes of 1/8 of an inch in wall
        thickness joined end to end to form a continuous vertically
        disposed conduit about 10 feet long. The spinel dispersion is
        taken to an atomizer and introduced into the drying system
        through the top. Three heat or drying zones 212, 214, 216, are
        arranged around the conduit. The first heating zone 212 is
        disposed around the upper portion of the conduit but about 3/4
        of a foot below the top of the conduit where it maintains a
        temperature of 150° C. within the conduit; the second heating
        zone 214 is disposed around the lower portion of the conduit and
        spaced 5 feet below the bottom of the first heating zone where
        it maintains a temperature of 350° C. within the conduit; and
        the third heating zone 216 is disposed around the bottom portion
        of the conduit and spaced half a foot below the bottom portion
        of the second heating zone where it maintains a temperature of
        430° C. Below the third heating zone 216 is a 2-foot long
        section 218 that is a continuation of the conduit and below
        section 218 is a half-foot long conical section 220 which
        terminates in an opening 2 inches in diameter. If temperature in
        the sections is not sufficiently high, LiF sintering aid will
        remain wet and the droplets will stick together, however, if the
        droplets are dried too fast, the deposited LiF will spall off
        the spinel droplets. If the given temperature profile disclosed
        herein is adhered to, satisfactory drying in a reasonable time
        is attained.<br>
        <br>
        Below conical section 220 is cyclone separator 222 wherein the
        coated particles (dried droplets) are separated from the gas
        stream and left in collection bin 224. Suction hose 226
        transports the gaseous components to exhaust. Coated particles
        from the collection bin are taken to densification.<br>
        <br>
        The spray-dried coated particles, which can contain at least one
        spinel particle, are hot-pressed in an inert atmosphere at about
        1550° C. and 5000 psi for about 2 hours to obtain a transparent
        monolithic sintered spinel product of less than 0.2% porosity.
        When in the hot press, minimal pressure of about 50 psi is
        initially applied until the coated spinel powder starts to
        densify at about 1100° C. and thereafter, pressure is raised to
        about 5000 psi when a temperature of about 1450° C. is reached.
        In a preferred embodiment, the heating schedule in this
        densifying procedure, which is conducted under initial vacuum of
        about 10&lt;-4 &gt;Torr, includes about a 20° C./minute ramp
        from ambient temperature to 950° C., about a half hour hold to
        allow the sintering aid LiF to melt and clean/etch the spinel
        particle surfaces, another 20° C./minute ramp to 1200° C.,
        another half hour hold to allow vaporized sintering aid to leave
        the hot press, still another 20° C./minute ramp to about 1550°
        C., a 2-hour hold to fully density the spinel powder into a
        transparent shape, and turning off the heating elements and the
        hydraulic pump to allow pressure to bleed-off and temperature of
        the product in the hot press to cool to about room temperature
        under a vacuum of less than 10&lt;-3 &gt;Torr. Melting point of
        LiF is 850° C. and its boiling is about 2000° C. but starts
        vaporizing above its melting point. The heating and pressure
        schedule can be modified to accommodate other sintering aids.<br>
        <br>
        In densifying the coated particles, it is important to keep in
        mind the necessity of removing the sintering aid, such as LiF,
        at the lowest possible temperature below about 1000° C. to a
        level below about 500 ppm lithium from the sintering aid LiF,
        more typically below about 100 ppm lithium, and below about 50
        ppm fluorine from the sintering aid LiF, more typically below
        about 10 ppm fluorine, hereafter, referred to as essentially
        devoid of the sintering aid components, in this case lithium and
        fluorine. It is necessary to abide by these limits since at
        higher temperatures, reaction between the sintering aid and
        spinel is made more likely with the imminent production of
        impurities, such as lithium aluminate, lithium aluminum
        oxyfluoride and lithium aluminum fluoride which may negatively
        affect properties, such as the optical and mechanical
        properties.<br>
        <br>
        Although the HIP procedure is typically omitted in this novel
        and unobvious process, and thus the cost of resulting product is
        reduced by 1/3 to 1/2, it may be desirable to subject the
        product of this invention to the HIP procedure of short duration
        to positively alter transparency, porosity or some other
        parameter(s) of the product. The HIP procedure for a sintering
        aid, like LiF, is carried out in an inert atmosphere at
        temperature above 1500° C., such as about 1750° C., and at a
        pressure above 20,000 psi, such as about 30,000 psi, to obtain a
        transparent product of porosity on the order of less than 0.2%.
        Duration of the HIP procedure in the past has been 1 day,
        however, with the process of this invention, HIP duration may be
        as short as about 1 hour and is typically 1-4 hours, when used.
        Generally, density of spinel products should be greater than
        99.5% to have transparency since such products with density of
        less than about 99.5% are milky white and opaque.<br>
        <br>
        The novel process disclosed herein is unobvious since it yields
        a transparent product after hot pressing in absence of the HIP
        procedure; reduces hot pressing conditions, provides for better
        reproducibility; increases yield; provides for smaller average
        grain size; reduces porosity; and minimizes exaggerated grain
        growth. Generally, the smaller and the more uniform grain size,
        the better the optical properties, up to a point. Once the
        particles become too small, such smaller than about 0.05 µm,
        strength, and possibly other parameters are negatively impacted.<br>

        FIG. 3 is a graph which shows variation of transmission at
        different wavelengths of light with the manner of preparing
        sintered and densified spinel experimental disks which were 1?
        in diameter and 1 mm in thickness. The disks were polished,
        first with SiC and then with diamond before use. The curves in
        FIG. 3 are identified as #1, #2, #3 and #4. Curve #1 was made by
        testing disks prepared by mechanical mixing 0.5% by weight of
        the sintering aid LiF with spinel particles, and is not
        representative of the invention herein: curve #2 was made by
        testing disks prepared by spraying 0.5% by weight of the
        sintering aid LiF pursuant to the invention herein; curve #3 was
        made by testing disks prepared by spraying 2% by weight of the
        sintering aid LiF pursuant to the invention herein; and curve #4
        represents theoretical or a solid monolith of spinel MgAl2O4
        where porosity was essentially zero. Data for the theoretical
        curve #4 was obtained from literature. Spinel powder particles
        that were used to prepare disks #1, #2 and #3 correspond to
        curves #1, #2 and #3 of FIG. 3, were in the range of 500 nm-10
        µm. In preparing disk #1, the spinel particles and the
        particulate LiF sintering aid were mixed in a mortar and pestle
        for about 5 minutes whereas for disks #2 and #3, a sintering aid
        (LiF) solution was prepared, as described above, and used to
        spray-dry a LiF coating on the spinel particles. For disks #1,
        #2 and #3, densification in a hot press was carried out at
        initial vacuum of 110 Torr pursuant to the following schedule:
        20° C./minute ramp from ambient to 950° C.; 30-minute hold
        period; another 20° C./minute ramp from 950° C. to 1200° C.;
        another 30-minute hold period; another 20° C./minute ramp from
        1200° C. to 1550° C.; 2-hour hold period; and an extended cool
        down and pressure bleed-off period. Transparency or opacity of
        the disks corresponding to the curves #1, #2 and #3 is
        illustrated in FIG. 4 where disk #1 is shown as being opaque,
        disk #2 is shown as being partially transparent, and disk #3 is
        shown as being transparent. From FIG. 3, it is apparent that in
        the visible region of 0.4-0.7 µm, only disk #3 reaches
        transparency in the area of about 55%. It should be noted that,
        based on the data for curve #4 in FIG. 3, transmission drops
        from about 80% to about nil at a wavelength of about 0.3 µm.<br>
        <br>
        The coating thickness on the particles can be varied, inter
        alia, by adjusting dilutions of the coating solution and/or by
        adjusting frequency of the atomizer; if an ultrasonic atomizer
        is used. For purposes herein, it has been found that coating
        thickness in the range of 1-1000 nm, more typically 2-200 nm is
        suitable. Uniformity of coating thickness was confirmed by
        scanning electron microscopy.<br>

        <b>FIG. 5 shows superior properties of the magnesium aluminum
          spinel product compared to glass.</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        Having described the invention, the following examples are given
        as particular embodiments thereof and to demonstrate the
        practice and advantages thereof. It is understood that the
        examples are given by way of illustration and are not intended
        to limit the specification or the claims in any manner.<br>
        <br>
        <b>EXAMPLE 1</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        This example details the use of lithium fluoride (LiF) sintering
        aid as a coating on magnesium aluminate (MgAl2O4) spinel
        particles. The use of LiF coating allows the hot pressing of the
        coated spinel particles in an inert atmosphere into a sintered
        transparent shape that has 70% transmission, as is detailed in
        Ex. 2.<br>
        <br>
        The sintering aid in this example was 0.2 grams of LiF powder
        with a particle size in the range of 500 nm-10 µm. The LiF was
        initially dissolved in 220 ml of deionized water by mixing for
        about a quarter of one hour followed by addition of 780 ml of
        ethanol with mixing for about another quarter of one hour.<br>
        <br>
        Ten grams of the spinel powder was mixed with the LiF sintering
        aid solution to form a dispersion that was delivered to an
        ultrasonic atomizer at a rate of 30 ml/minute using a metering
        pump and sprayed. The LiF sintering aid solution was at a
        neutral pH of about 7 which prevented LiF dissolved in the
        solution from precipitating on the spinel particles in the
        dispersion. The atomizer was operated at a frequency of 40 kHz
        and produced a fine stream of 45-micron droplets, containing 1-3
        spinel particles, that were passed through a drying system
        illustrated in FIG. 2 at a rate of about 9 cm/second before
        being collected in a cyclone separator to form dried coated
        particles.<br>
        <br>
        The droplets from the atomizer were introduced into the dryer
        system where the first drying zone was 1 foot from the top and
        temperature therein was 150° C. The second drying zone was 4
        feet from below the first and was also 1 foot in length, as were
        all the others, but its temperature was 350° C. The third drying
        zone was 1/2 foot below the second and its temperature was 430°
        C. Below the third drying zone, there was a 2-foot straight
        section followed by a three quarter of a foot conical section.
        The dried coated particles issuing from the conical section
        through a 2-inch opening were directed to a cyclone separator
        where the dried coated particles were separated and kept in a
        bin and the gaseous components were removed through the suction
        hose. The coated particles from the bin were later removed to be
        densified. The coated particles were characterized by X-ray
        diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and x-ray
        fluorescence. The coated particles were characterized as
        containing spinel (MgAl2O4) particles with a LiF coating.<br>
        <br>
        <b>EXAMPLE </b><b>2</b><br>
        <br>
        This example provides details as to densification of the dried
        coated spinel particles prepared in the manner described in Ex.
        1, above. The product had transmission of 70% and was prepared
        in a manner that did not include the expensive HIP procedure.<br>
        <br>
        The coated particles in powder form and prepared as described in
        Ex. 1, above, were placed in grafoil-lined graphite hot press
        die and the die was placed in an inert argon atmosphere (or a
        vacuum of 10&lt;-4 &gt;Torr). Minimal pressure was applied until
        the powder started to densify at about 1100° C. and pressure was
        stepped up to about 5000 psi when the temperature of about 1450°
        C. was attained. The heating schedule included a 20° C./minute
        ramp from ambient to 950° C., a 30-minute hold to allow LiF to
        melt and clean/etch the spinel particle surfaces, a 20°
        C./minute ramp from 950° C. to 1200° C., a 30-minute hold to
        allow vaporized LiF, and probably other components, to escape
        the hot press die, a 20° C./minute ramp to 1550° C., and a
        2-hour hold to fully density the spinel powder into a
        transparent shape. The heating elements and the hydraulic pump
        were then turned off to allow natural cooling of the hot press
        and allow the pressure to bleed-off, which took about 3 hours.<br>
        <br>
        While presently preferred embodiments have been shown of the
        novel and unobvious sintered spinel products and their
        preparation, persons skilled in this art will readily appreciate
        that various additional changes and modifications can be made
        without departing from the spirit of the invention as defined
        and differentiated by the following claims.<br>
