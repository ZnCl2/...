      <div align="center"><b>Water filter from wood offers portable,
          eco-friendly purification in emergencies</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      What can the forests of Scandinavia possibly offer to migrants in
      faraway refugee camps? Clean water may be one thing.<br>
      <br>
      A bacteria-trapping material developed from wood by researchers
      KTH Royal Institute of Technology is now being tested for use as a
      water purification filter. The aim is to use it in places where
      there is no infrastructure or clean water supply.<br>
      <br>
      The material, which combines wood cellulose with a
      positively-charged polymer, can trap bacteria by attracting and
      binding the bacteria to the material surface. It shows promise for
      bandages, plasters and packaging that kill bacteria without
      releasing toxins into the environment.<br>
      <br>
      Led by Professor Monica Ek, the Swedish research team is
      investigating whether the material can enable portable on-site
      water treatment where no facilities or wells exist to meet demand.<br>
      <br>
      "Our aim is that we can provide the filter for a portable system
      that doesn't need electricity – just gravity – to run raw water
      through it," says Anna Ottenhall, a PhD student at KTH's School of
      Chemical Science and Engineering. "The great idea is that we are
      trapping the bacteria and removing them from the water by our
      positively-charged filter. The bacteria trapping material does not
      leach any toxic chemicals into the water, as many other on-site
      purification methods do."<br>
      <br>
      Her co-supervisor, Josefin Illergård, has been working with the
      antibacterial fibers from wood cellulose for about a decade. "We
      had this fantastic material that is antibacterial and can be used
      in different ways, and we wanted to see how to use it in a way
      that truly makes a difference – a way that addresses a big problem
      in the world," Illergård says.<br>
      <br>
      Illergård says the fibres are dipped in a positively-charged
      polymer solution that makes the surface becomes positively
      charged. Bacteria and viruses are negatively charged and therefore
      stick to the positively-charged polymer surface. From there, they
      cannot free themselves and reproduce, and as a result they die.<br>
      <br>
      "One of the advantages of surfaces covered with polymers is that
      bacteria will not develop any resistance," she says.<br>
      <br>
      After it is used, the filter can be burned.<br>
      <br>
      The technology is one of several innovative ways wood-based
      materials are being developed at KTH, which recently has announced
      advances with see-through wood, squishy batteries made from wood,
      wood cellulose-based foam, and even a polystyrene alternative from
      wood.<br>
      <br>
      The water filter project also is just one of the many
      water-related research projects ongoing at KTH, where a new
      organizational unit, WaterCentre@KTH, was officially launched on
      World Water Day 2017 to stimulate cross-disciplinary collaboration
      and new water-related research approaches within KTH and with
      industry partners, other knowledge institutions and public
      agencies.<br>

      </div>
      <br>
      Researchers at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm have
      discovered an antibacterial polymer that can be used in everyday
      products such as sportswear, diapers and bandages, without causing
      resistant bacteria.<br>
      <br>
      "We have managed to find an antibacterial polymer that attaches
      stably to cellulose and therefore cannot be released into the
      environment," says Josefin Illergård, a chemistry researcher at
      KTH.<br>
      <br>
      The discovery could be an important breakthrough in the search for
      environmentally-friendly ways to control bacteria while preventing
      antibiotic resistance and resistant bacteria.<br>
      <br>
      Illergård says the team's discovery is based on cellulose fibres
      embedded in a polymer, which kills bacteria. Cellulose is the most
      common organic substance in nature and the primary structural
      component of plant cell walls. The active polymer is so strongly
      bonded to the fibres of the cellulose material that it does not
      loosen or leak into the environment via water.<br>
      <br>
      Antibacterial agents such as triclosan and silver ions are
      commonly used in sportswear and shoes to remove unpleasant odors
      from bacteria formation. But such biocides leak into the
      environment when the treated garments or surfaces are washed,
      raising the risk that bacteria will gradually become resistant to
      their effect.<br>
      <br>
      "If someone uses a cloth to wipe a countertop treated with
      antibacterial agents, and that cloth is rinsed in the sink, those
      substances are then spread further through the drain and into the
      environment where they can contaminate soil and water and give
      rise to bacterial resistance," Illergård says.<br>
      <br>
      She says that bacteria must come in direct contact with the
      material for the antibacterial process to work.<br>
      <br>
      Because polymer has a positive charge and bacteria a negative
      charge, the new material actually attracts bacteria, she says. The
      material does not contain large amounts of polymer; and only
      non-toxic nitrogen oxides remain after it is burned. Nevertheless,
      the team's goal for the future is to continue the research and try
      to replace the antibacterial polymer with an entirely renewable
      material.<br>
      <br>
      "We know that this project is of international interest,"
      Illergård says. "Our papers have been requested by companies
      abroad and we are getting a lot of feedback when we present our
      findings at conferences.<br>
      <br>
      "In the future, I believe our material will be used in cleaning
      clothes, in sanitation for hospitals and in different kinds of
      water purification filters," she says.<br>
      <br>
      Illergård says the material could be ideal for simple water
      treatment in the future. "What if water could be purified in an
      environmentally friendly manner by our material, instead of just
      strainers?" she asks. "Many lives would be saved, and the material
      could be placed directly on the fire and burned after use."<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Cellulose nanofibril (CNF) materials have been widely studied in
      recent years and are suggested for a wide range of applications,
      e.g., medical and hygiene products. One property not very well
      studied is the interaction between bacteria and these materials
      and how this can be controlled. The current work studies how
      bacteria adhere to different CNF materials modified with
      polyelectrolyte multilayers. The tested materials were
      TEMPO-oxidized to have different surface charges,
      periodate-oxidized to vary the water interaction and hot-pressed
      to alter the surface structure. Then, multilayers were constructed
      using polyvinylamine (PVAm) and polyacrylic acid. Both the
      material surface charge and water interaction affect the amount of
      polymer adsorbed to the surfaces. Increasing the surface charge
      decreases the adsorption after the first PVAm layer, possibly due
      to conformational changes. Periodate-oxidized and crosslinked
      films have low initial polymer adsorptions; the decreased swelling
      prevents polymer diffusion into the CNF micropore structure.
      Microscopic analysis after incubating the samples with bacterial
      suspensions show that only the materials with the lowest surface
      charge enable bacteria to adhere to the surface because, when
      adsorbing up to 5 layers PVAm/PAA, the increased anionic surface
      charge appears to decrease the net surface charge. Both the
      amounts of PVAm and PAA influence the net surface charge and thus
      the bacterial adhesion. The structure generated by the
      hot-pressing of the films also strongly increases the number of
      bacteria adhering to the surfaces. These results indicate that the
      bacterial adhesion to CNF materials can be tailored using
      polyelectrolyte multilayers on different CNF substrates.<br>

      The use of cellulose aerogels as antibacterial materials has been
      investigated by applying a contact-active layer-by-layer

      multilayers of polyvinylamine (PVAm) and polyacrylic acid to

      monitoring the subsequent bacterial adhesion revealed that up to
      26 mg PVAm g aerogel−1 was adsorbed without noticeably affecting
      the aerogel structure. The antibacterial effect was tested by
      measuring the reduction of viable bacteria in solution when the
      aerogels were present. The results show that &gt;99.9% of the

      Biocidal multilayered system, characterized in that it comprises
      at least the following layers: -an anionic or cationic carrier,
      preferably cellulose as anionic carrier, -on this carrier
      alternating polymeric cationic and anionic layers starting with a
      layer having a charge opposite to that of the carrier, -wherein at
      least one layer is hydrophobically modified.<br>
      <br>
      [0001] The invention relates to a biocidal multilayered system,
      characterized in that it comprises at least the following layers:<br>
      <br>
      an anionic or cationic carrier, preferably cellulose as anionic
      carrier,<br>
      on this carrier alternating polymeric cationic and anionic layers
      starting with a layer having a charge opposite to that of the
      carrier,<br>
      wherein at least one layer is hydrophobically modified.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Biocidal agents kill off microorganisms, such as bacteria,
      fungi, yeasts, algae or viruses, or prevent at least their
      reproduction and/or growth.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] In the most varied substrates there is a wish, often indeed
      a need, for a biocidal treatment. Examples of these include
      substrates for medical applications, packaging materials for
      foodstuffs or substrates for diverse industrial applications, in
      particular filters, e.g. for air conditioning systems.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] The biocidal action of polyvinylamines, also in combination
      with quaternary ammonium salts, is disclosed, for example, in U.S.
      Pat. No. 6,261,581 and DE-A 196 08 555, and in this German patent
      application having the file reference number 10 2005 021 364.2,
      which on the priority date of this application has not yet been
      published.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] The biocidal action of polyethylenimines, hydrophobically
      modified polyethylenimines and of mixtures of polyethylenimines
      with quaternary ammonium salts is disclosed, for example, in WO
      2004/087226 or the following publications.<br>
      <br>

      bacteria by rupturing cell membranes with no resistance

      <br>
      [0010] Multilayered systems of alternating anionic and cationic
      polyelectrolytes and their preparation are disclosed in WO
      00/32702. Papers and nonwoven fabrics (nonwovens) are coated with
      this multilayered system in order in particular to increase the
      strength of the substrates.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] The preparation of hydrophobically modified polyvinylamines
      and their use in paper production are described, for example, in
      WO 97/42229 and WO 03/099880.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] The biocidal action of coatings produced to date with
      polyvinylamines or polyethylenimines is often not quite adequate.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] Accordingly, it was an object of the present invention to
      provide coatings of these polymers having improved biocidal
      action.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] Correspondingly, the multilayered system defined at the
      outset and its use were discovered. The use of hydrophobically
      modified polyvinylamine as a biocidal agent, in particular in
      association with the multilayered system, was also found.<br>
      <br>
      <b>The Carrier</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0015] The carrier can be composed of any material; examples which
      come into consideration are carriers composed of synthetic or
      natural polymers containing anionic or cationic groups.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] A preferred carrier is cellulose. Cellulose usually has
      anionic groups and, accordingly, is an anionic carrier.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] The carrier can be pretreated in order to produce ionic
      groups on its surface or to increase the number of ionic groups on
      the surface of the carrier. For example, the surface of cellulose
      can be treated with an oxidizing agent to increase the number of
      anionic groups.<br>
      <br>
      <b>The Layers in General</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0018] The layers are formed from polymers. The cationic polymer
      layers consist of polymers having cationic groups and the anionic
      polymer layers consist of polymers having anionic groups.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] The cationic and anionic polymer layers in the multilayered
      system each contain preferably 0.1 to 22 milliequivalents of ionic
      groups (cationic or anionic groups), particularly preferably at
      least 0.5 and very particularly preferably at least 1
      milliequivalent of ionic groups/1 gram of polymer.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] The polymer layers contain preferably 0.001 to 1000 mg,
      particularly preferably 0.01 to 100 mg and very particularly
      preferably 0.1 to 10 mg of polymer/square meter.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] The polymer layers of the multilayered system are
      alternately cationic and anionic. On top of an anionic carrier
      there necessarily follows a cationic polymer layer and on top of a
      cationic polymer layer there necessarily follows an anionic
      polymer layer and vice versa.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] The multilayered system contains at least one cationic
      polymer layer and at least one anionic polymer layer. Accordingly,
      the multilayered system contains in total at least two polymer
      layers, preferably it contains more than two polymer layers, in
      particular at least three polymer layers, particularly preferably
      at least four polymer layers. The number of polymer layers can
      have any magnitude, but is generally not greater than 20, or than
      10.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] The total weight of all polymer layers together amounts
      preferably to 0.05 to 1000 mg, particularly preferably 0.1 to 100
      mg and very particularly preferably 0.5 to 50 mg, in particular 1
      to 20 mg of polymer/square meter of carrier (Note: One gram of
      cellulose of customary thickness corresponds to approx. 1 square
      meter).<br>
      <br>
      [0024] The total thickness of all polymer layers can be, for

      <b>The Cationic Polymers</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0025] The polymer in the cationic layer can be any polymer having
      cationic groups. For the cationic groups, cationic groups having
      quadricovalent nitrogen (ammonium groups) are preferred; in
      particular the quadricovalent nitrogen carries hydrogen atoms as
      substituents apart from the bonds to the polymer (one bond in the
      case of polyvinylamines or two bonds in the case of
      polyethylenimines).<br>
      <br>
      [0026] For the cationic polymers, polyethylenimines or
      polyvinylamines in particular come into consideration.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] Here a polyethylenimine is defined as any polymer which is
      built up of at least 10% by weight, preferably of at least 30% by
      weight, very particularly preferably of at least 50% by weight,
      and especially of at least 70% by weight of repeat units of
      formula I<br>

      <br>
      [0000] where the N atom may have another substituent, in
      particular a H atom, or two other substituents; in the latter case
      this is a quaternary ammonium group with a positive charge on the
      N atom (cationic group).<br>
      <br>
      [0028] Here also a polyvinylamine is defined as any polymer which
      is built up of at least 10% by weight, preferably of at least 30%
      by weight, very particularly preferably of at least 50% by weight,
      and especially of at least 70% by weight of repeat units of
      formula II<br>

      [0000] where the N atom may have two other substituents, in
      particular two H atoms (primary amino group), or three other
      substituents; in the latter case this is a quaternary ammonium
      group with a positive charge on the N atom (cationic group).<br>
      <br>
      [0029] In a special embodiment the polyethylenimine consists of at
      least 90% by weight, in particular of 100% by weight, of units of
      formula I.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] In a special embodiment the polyvinylamine of formula II
      consists of at least 90% by weight, in particular of 100% by
      weight of units of formula II.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] Polyvinylamines are particularly preferred as polymers for
      the cationic layer.<br>
      <br>
      <b>The Polyvinylamines</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0032] In particular polyvinylamines are polymers of
      vinylcarboxylamides which in particular contain secondary and
      tertiary amino groups in the form of substituted amide groups and
      particularly preferred are polymers containing primary amino
      groups obtainable from these polyvinylcarboxylamides by
      hydrolysis.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] In particular the polyvinylamines are produced by
      polymerizing monomers containing N-vinylcarboxylamide units and
      subsequent hydrolysis. The are obtainable, for example, by
      polymerizing N-vinylformamide, N-vinyl-N-methylformamide,
      N-vinylacetamide, N-vinyl-N-methylacetamide,
      N-vinyl-N-ethylacetamide and N-vinylpropionamide. The named
      monomers can be polymerized either on their own or together with
      other monomers. N-vinylformamide is preferred.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] Monoethylenically unsaturated monomers that come into
      consideration for copolymerization with N-vinylcarboxylamides
      include all those compounds which are copolymerizable therewith.
      Examples of these are vinyl esters of saturated carboxylic acids
      having 1 to 6 carbon atoms such as vinyl formate, vinyl acetate,
      N-vinylpyrrolidone, N-vinylimidazole, N-vinylimidazoline, vinyl
      propionate and vinyl butyrate and vinyl ethers such as C1 to C6
      alkyl vinyl ethers, e.g. methyl or ethyl vinyl ether, Other
      suitable comonomers are esters of alcohols having, for example, 1
      to 12 carbon atoms or amides and nitriles of ethylenically
      unsaturated C3 to C6 carboxylic acids, for example methyl
      acrylate, methyl methacrylate, ethyl acrylate, ethyl methacrylate
      and dimethyl maleate, acrylamide and methacrylamide as well as
      acrylonitrile and methacrylonitrile.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] Polymerization of the monomers is usually carried out in
      the presence of polymerization initiators which form free
      radicals. Homo- and copolymers can be obtained by all known
      methods, for example they are obtained by solution polymerization
      in water, alcohols, ethers or dimethylformamide or in mixtures of
      different solvents, by precipitation polymerization, reverse
      suspension polymerization (polymerization of an emulsion of an
      aqueous phase containing monomer in an oil phase) and
      polymerization of a water-in-water emulsion, in which, for
      example, an aqueous monomer solution is dissolved or emulsified in
      an aqueous phase and polymerized to form an aqueous dispersion of
      a water-soluble polymer, as described, for example, in WO
      00/27893. Following polymerization, the homo- and copolymers
      containing embedded N-vinylcarboxylamide units are partially or
      completely hydrolyzed if primary amino groups are desired.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] The degree of hydrolysis can be, for example, 1 to 100 mol.
      %, preferably 25 to 100 mol. %, particularly preferably 50 to 100
      mol. % and especially preferably 70 to 100 mol. %. The degree of
      hydrolysis corresponds to the content of primary vinylamine groups
      in mol. % in the polymers.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] As a rule only the hydrolyzed primary amino groups can be
      easily converted into a cationic group; accordingly, the degree of
      hydrolysis is at least 10 mol. %, in particular at least 20 mol.
      %.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] Hydrolysis of the polymers described above is carried out
      according to known methods by the action of acids (e.g. mineral
      acids such as sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid or phosphoric acid,
      carboxylic acids such as formic acid or acetic acid, or sulfonic
      acids or phosphonic acids), bases or enzymes, as described, for
      example, in DE-A 31 28 478 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,132,558. When acids
      are used as hydrolyzing agent the vinylamine units in the polymers
      are present in the form of the ammonium salt, while on hydrolysis
      with bases the free amino groups are obtained.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] The average relative molar masses, MW, of the vinylamines
      can be, for example, 500 to 10 million, preferably 750 to 5
      million and particularly preferably 1,000 to 2 million g/mol.
      (determined by light scattering). This range of relative molar
      masses corresponds, for example, to K values of 30 to 150,
      preferably 60 to 100 (determined according to H. Fikentscher in 5%
      aqueous common salt solution at 25° C., a pH of 7 and a polymer
      concentration of 0.5% by weight). Particularly preferably
      polyvinylamines are used which have a K value of 85 to 95.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] The cationic groups can be readily introduced into the
      polyvinylamine by adjusting the pH. The milliequivalents of
      cationic groups specified above generally appear at a pH of less
      than 7, in particular less than 6.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] The charge density at pH 7 is in particular from 5 to 18
      meq/g and in particular from 10 to 16 meq/g.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] The polyvinylamine is preferably employed in the form of an
      aqueous dispersion or solution.<br>
      <br>
      <b>The Anionic Polymers</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0043] The polymer in the anionic layers is in particular a
      polyacid in which an appropriate proportion of the acid groups is
      present in the form of the anionic salt group.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] The acid group can be, for example, a carboxylic acid, a
      sulfonic acid or a phosphonic acid group, preferably a carboxylic
      acid group.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] This is in particular a polyacrylic acid or polymethacrylic
      acid (poly(meth)acrylic acid).<br>
      <br>
      [0046] By poly(meth)acrylic acid is meant a polymer which is made
      up to the extent of at least 10% by weight, preferably of at least
      30% by weight, very particularly preferably of at least 50% by
      weight and especially of at least 70% by weight of acrylic acid or
      methacrylic acid units or salts thereof.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] The poly(meth)acrylic acid may contain the monomers
      identified above as comonomers.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] In a particular embodiment the poly(meth)acrylic acid
      consists of at least 90% by weight and especially of 100% by
      weight of (meth)acrylic acid or salts thereof.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] The above content levels of anionic groups can be readily
      achieved by adjusting the pH, preferably to a pH greater than 6
      and in particular greater than 7.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] The proportion of anionic groups in the anionic polymer,
      preferably the polyacid, is as specified above for ionic groups.<br>
      <br>
      <b>The Hydrophobically Modified Layer</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0051] According to the invention at least one of the polymer
      layers is hydrophobically modified. For this purpose either the
      polymer in the cationic layer or the polymer in the anionic layer
      can be suitably modified by a proportion of hydrophobic groups.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] Particularly preferably the outermost layer is
      hydrophobically modified and particularly preferably the outermost
      layer is a hydrophobically modified cationic layer.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] Preferably at least one of the cationic polymer layers is
      hydrophobically modified, but a plurality, all or just one of the
      cationic layers may be hydrophobically modified. Particularly
      preferably only one cationic layer is hydrophobically modified and
      in this case the particular layer in question is the outermost
      layer.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] In the case of hydrophobic modification also, the polymer
      in question further contains the above proportion of anionic or
      cationic groups.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] By hydrophobic modification is meant the existence of
      hydrophobic side groups on the main chain of the polymer; the
      hydrophobic groups are terminal groups, i.e. they are located at
      the end of the side chain and do not link the polymer main chain
      to other polymer main chains.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] The hydrophobic groups need not be directly connected to
      the polymer main chain, on the contrary the linkage may even be
      made via hydrophilic groups, e.g. the ammonium group of the
      polyvinylamine.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] The hydrophobic groups are, in particular, hydrocarbon
      groups or halogenated hydro-carbon groups containing at least 2
      interconnected C atoms and particularly preferably containing at
      least 3 interconnected C atoms.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] These can be, for example, alkyl groups or aryl groups.
      Groups which come into consideration are alkyl groups having at
      least 2, preferably at least 3, particularly preferably at least 4
      C atoms or halogen derivatives thereof. The number of C atoms is
      generally no more than 30, in particular no more than 20. The
      groups may also be alkoxy or polyalkoxy groups, these being alkoxy
      groups having at least 3 C atoms and in particular a propoxy or
      polypropoxy group. The hydrophilic group is usually not directly
      connected to the main polymer chain and is preferably linked to
      the main polymer chain via an intervening group (spacer) which may
      also be hydrophilic.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] The proportion of hydrophobic groups in the hydrophobic
      anionic or cationic layer is preferably 0.01 to 2.5 mol per 100
      gram of polymer, particularly preferably the proportion is at
      least 0.05, very particularly preferably at least 0.1 mol and in a
      particular embodiment at least 0.2 mol per 100 g of polymer. The
      proportion of hydrophobic groups is generally less than 2 mol, in
      particular less than 1.5 mol, per 100 gram of polymer. A common
      range is, in particular, 0.2 to 1.5 mol or 0.5 to 1.5 mol per 100
      gram of polymer.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Hydrophobically Modified Polyvinylamine</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0060] The hydrophobically modified polymer is preferably a
      hydrophobically modified polyvinylamine or polyethylenimine
      (cationic polymer or cationic layer). The hydrophobic modification
      of polyethylenimines is described, for example, in WO 2004/087226
      and hydrophobically modified polyvinylamines are described, for
      example, in WO 97/42229 and WO 03/099880.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] For purposes of the hydrophobic modification of
      polyvinylamines, preferably primary amino side groups (—NH2) are
      alkylated and treated to this end with suitable reactive
      compounds.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] The reactive compounds which come into consideration are,
      for example, isocyanate compounds, compounds having a carboxylic
      acid group or, in particular, compounds containing an epoxy group.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] Particularly preferred is a compound containing an epoxy
      group. After reaction of the primary amino group with the epoxy
      compound (e.g. epoxybutane) a H atom in the amino group has been
      replaced by the corresponding beta-hydroxy group (in this example
      the hydrophobic group is the terminal ethyl group).<br>
      <br>
      [0064] In order to produce the hydrophobically modified
      polyvinylamine the procedure set out below can be used.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] First of all hydrolysis of polyvinylcarboxylamides (see
      above) is carried out under alkaline or acidic conditions and
      stopped by changing the pH as soon as the desired degree of
      hydrolysis and hence the desired quantity of primary amino groups
      has been achieved. After this treatment with the reactive compound
      ensues in a second step.<br>
      <br>
      [0066] It is advantageous to use a single-stage reaction in which
      a start is first made with the hydrolysis and then the reactive
      compound (epoxy compound) is added before hydrolysis has gone to
      completion. By suitable choice of quantities and the timing of
      addition the desired degree of hydrolysis and the desired extent
      of conversion by the reactive compound can simultaneously be
      determined.<br>
      <br>
      [0067] In polyvinylamines and polyethylenimines the N atom to
      which the hydrophobic group is directly or indirectly attached may
      also at the same time be cationic. To achieve this the pH of the
      hydrophobic polyvinylamine or polyethylenimine is suitably
      adjusted.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Preparation of the Multilayered System</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0068] The multilayered system can be produced as already
      described, for example, in WO 00/32702. In doing so the carrier is
      first of all treated with the oppositely charged polymer. If the
      carrier is anionic, like cellulose for example, the carrier is
      first treated with the solution of the cationic polymer. To do
      this the carrier can be simply immersed in the solution. Due to
      electrostatic attraction a layer of the cationic polymer is
      deposited and is bound to the carrier by electrostatic attraction.
      Any polymer not bound can be washed off, e.g. by immersion in
      water. The carrier coated in this way can then be correspondingly
      enveloped in other layers by always immersing it in the
      corresponding solution of polymer of opposite charge to the
      outermost layer.<br>
      <br>
      [0069] Accordingly, the cationic and anionic layers of the
      multilayered system are bound to one another in particular by
      formation of a polyelectrolyte system of the anionic groups of the
      anionic polymer with the cationic groups of the cationic polymer.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Use</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0070] The hydrophobic, cationic polyvinylamine has a biocidal
      action and can be employed as a biocide for the most varied
      purposes, e.g. in the foods sector for packaging materials treated
      with biocide, in the medical sector for preparations and devices
      treated with biocide and in the industrial sector as filters
      treated with biocide, for example, in particular filters in air
      conditioning units. To do this it can be applied in simple form to
      the substrates (carriers) to be given biocidal treatment.<br>
      <br>
      [0071] The biocidal action of the hydrophobic polyvinylamine is
      reinforced by the multilayered system. Accordingly, the
      multilayered system is most particularly suitable for the above
      purposes, in particular for the foods sector (packaging materials
      treated with biocide) and the medical sector (preparations and
      devices treated with biocide). To do this it can be applied as
      described above to the substrates (carriers) to be given biocidal
      treatment.<br>
      <br>
      [0072] Substrates composed of natural or synthetic polymers, paper
      or metal are suitable as carriers.<br>
      <br>
      [0073] Carriers coated with biocide are outstandingly effective
      against microorganisms such as viruses, yeasts, fungi and in
      particular against bacteria.<br>

      <br>
      [0090] As Hydrophobically modified polyvinylamine (PVAm) (Mw ca.

      <br>
      [0091] Poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) (Mw ca. 240,000) was purchased
      from Sigma-Aldrich. Escherichia coli; ATCC 11775, and Proteus
      mirabilis (P. mirabilis) were obtained from SIK (The Swedish
      Institute for Food and Biotechnology). Ringer's solution was
      prepared afresh as well as tryptone glucose extract (TGE). Growth
      agar medium used was Fluorocult E. coli O157:H7 agar, from MERCK.
      Phosphate buffers were prepared afresh. Ultra-pure water (Milli-Q
      plus system, Millipore) with a resistivity of 18.2 MΩ·cm was used
      in the experiments.<br>

      Preparation of Coated Surfaces<br>
      <br>
      <b>Step 1: Oxidation of Cellulose</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0092] Regenerated cellulose dialysis tubing was soaked in
      deionised water (40° C., 30 min.) in order to remove sodium azide.
      The cellulose dialysis tubing was then rinsed thoroughly with
      water and cut into pieces of size 5×5.4 cm (cellulose film with
      MWCO: 3,500). The pieces of cellulose tubing were cut open along
      one side and a centrefold was created. The films were once again
      rinsed in water. The oxidation process was performed according to
      the Kitaoka procedure [1] using TEMPO
      (2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidnyloxy radical), NaBr and a ̃10%
      NaClO solution. Reactions took place in a beaker at 21° C.
      treating up to ̃9 grams of regenerated cellulose. The pH was
      maintained at 10.5 with 0.05M of NaOH and the oxidation was
      stopped by adding a small amount of ethanol to the solution and
      thereafter washed thoroughly in deionised water. The membranes
      were stored in ultra pure water at 4° C. ATR-FTIR analyses were
      used to confirm that an oxidation had taken place.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Step 2: Polyelectrolyte and Solutions</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0093] PVAm (from example 3) was dialyzed using a dialysis
      membrane (Spectra/Por®6 product No: 88-132582 8000 Da MWCO,
      Spectrum Laboratories, Inc) for 5 days against water, changing the
      water several times a day. The product was dried in a vacuum
      freeze drier and stored in a desiccator at room temperature. The
      charge density at different values of pH of the polymer was
      determined using polyelectrolyte titration with potassium
      polyvinyl sulphate. PAA (Mw ca. 240,000, Sigma-Aldrich) was used
      without any further purification. PVAm and PAA solutions were
      prepared at 1 mg/ml in 10&lt;−2 &gt;M NaCl, and in phosphate
      buffers at 10&lt;−3 &gt;M KH2PO4. The adsorption strategy was: pH
      7.5 for the cationic solution and pH 3.5 for the anionic solution.
      The polyelectrolyte films were built on cellulose membranes in
      plastic Petri dishes at room temperature. The samples were dipped
      for 15 min alternatively in the polycationic and polyanionic
      solution. A rinsing solution of the same ionic strength and pH as
      the preceding polyelectrolyte solution was used after each
      adsorption step to remove excess polymer. 0.5, 2.5, and 5.5
      bilayers (corresponding to 1, 5 and 11 monolayers) were built on
      the cellulose membranes with the outer layer being the positively
      charged polymer. The build-up and increase of PVAm was followed
      using nitrogen elemental analysis (ANTEK)<br>
      <br>
      <b>Antibacterial Assessment</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0094] Escherichia coli (E. coli) were cultivated in 10 ml of TGE
      broth at 37° C. The bacterial cell concentration was quantified by
      decimal serial dilution with Ringer's solution. 100 μl samples
      from the dilution series was spread onto triplicate solid growth
      agar plates (Fluorocult). After incubation of the plates at 37°
      C., for 20 h, the number of colonies was counted manually. The
      concentration was estimated to ̃10&lt;9 &gt;E. coli CFU/ml after
      multiplying the result of the manual count with the dilution
      factor.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Antibacterial Screening in Solution</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0095] Polymer suspension of PVAm (example 3) with the
      concentration of 250, 25, and 2.5 μg/ml were prepared and tested
      against a concentration of 10&lt;5 &gt;CFU/ml of E. coli. Polymers
      were suspended both in ultra pure water and in Ringer's solution.
      Bacteria were added to the solution of polymers to give the
      desired amount of bacterial cells in the sample. To investigate
      the inhibition of growth by PVAm (example 3) in solution 100 μL of
      each inoculated polymer suspension is applied on an agar plate
      (Fluorocult). A solution in ultra pure water/Ringer's solution
      without polymers is used as a reference. The plates were incubated
      at 37° C. for 20 h. The number of colonies on the agar plates was
      counted the following day.<br>

      <b>Antibacterial Screening of Polyelectrolyte-Treated Cellulose
        Films</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0096] Untreated cellulose film (control) and cellulose films
      treated with polyelectrolyte were placed on solid growth agar and
      5 μL of bacteria suspension (conc.: ̃10&lt;7 &gt;CFU/ml) was added
      onto the substrate. Since the cellulose film is based on a
      dialysis tubing device the membrane has a porous structure
      allowing the underlying agar growth medium to be in contact with
      the bacteria. The membranes have a fold on the middle as a result
      of the shape of the opened dialysis tubing device. Bacteria were
      placed on one side of the folded cellulose film (pristine or
      functionalized). The other side was folded on top of the incubated
      sample. This is done in order to evenly spread the bacteria over
      the test surface. The test samples were incubated for 20 h at 37°
      C. The number of colonies on the agar plates was studied the
      following day. The bacterial assays (both in solution and on
      cellulose films) were carried out in triplicate.<br>
      <br>
      [0097] Only E. coli was used to investigate the antibacterial
      activity of the polymer-treated cellulose films. The activity
      against E. coli was studies as a function of adsorbed layers
      containing the modified PVAm (example 3). The inhibition of growth
      of E. coli of the functionalized cellulose film was investigated
      by a comparison of an untreated control sample. No quantification
      using the present method has been done as the colonies are
      difficult to count manually. It is, however, possible to
      distinguish the degree of growth by comparing the intensity of the
      yellow colour of the samples in relation to each other and control
      (untreated) samples. The sorbitol in the Fluorocult agar serves,
      together with pH indicator bromothymol blue, to determine the
      ability to degrade sorbitol. In the case of sorbitol-positive
      organisms (E. coli in the present study) the colonies of the
      bacteria turn yellow in colour. A decrease in the intensity of the
      yellow colour can be visualized as the number of layers containing
      modified PVAm is increased. The results indicate that E. coli are
      inhibited by the presence of PVAm and can not proliferate
      properly.<br>
