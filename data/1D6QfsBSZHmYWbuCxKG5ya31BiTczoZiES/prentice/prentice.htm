      <p>To All Whom It may Concern: </p>
      <p>Be it known that I, Frank Wyatt Prentice, of the City of
        Meadville, County of Crawford, State of Pennsylvania, Electrical
        Engineer, having invented new and useful improvements in
        Electrical Power Accumulators, do hereby declare that the
        following is a full, clear and exact description of the same: </p>
      <p>My invention relates to improvements in Electrical power
        Accumulators and the like, wherein the earth acting as rotor and
        the surrounding air as stator, collects the energy thus
        generated by the earth rotating on its axis, and utilizes the
        same for power and other purposes. </p>
      <p>In the development of my Wireless Train Control System for
        railways, covered by my United States Letters Patent Number
        843,550, I discovered that with an antenna consisting of one
        wire of suitable diameter supported by insulating means 3 to 6
        inches above the ground and extending one half mile, more or
        less in length, the said antenna being grounded at one end
        through a spark gap and energized at the other end by a high
        frequency generator of 500 watts input and having a secondary
        frequency of 500,000 would produce in said antenna oscillatory
        frequency the same as that of the earth currents, and thus
        electrical power from the surrounding media was accumulated
        along the length of the transmission antenna and with a closed
        oscillatory loop antenna 18 feet ion length run parallel with
        the transmission antenna at a distance of approximately 20 feet
        it was possible to obtain by tuning the loop antenna, sufficient
        power to light to full candle power a series bank of 50 60-watt
        carbon lamps [3 kw]. Lowering or raising the frequency of
        500,000 resulted in diminishing the amount of power received in
        the 18-foot antenna. Likewise, the raising of the transmission
        antenna resulted in a proportionate decrease of power picked up
        on the receiving antenna and at 6 feet above the earth no power
        whatever was obtainable without a change of potential and
        frequency. </p>
      <p>It is the objective of my generic invention to utilize the
        power generated by the earth by means herein described and
        illustrated in the drawings. The two figures in the drawings
        illustrate simple and preferred forms of this invention, but I
        wish it understood that no limitation is necessarily made as to
        the exact and precise circuits, shapes, positions, and
        structural details therein shown, exhibited and herein described
        in combination or otherwise and that changes, alterations and
        modifications may be made when desired within the scope of my
        invention and as specifically pointed out in the claim. </p>

      <p>Referring particularly to Figure 1; 1 and 2 are alternating
        current feed wires supplying 110 volts 60 cycles to a high
        frequency generator. 3 is a switch and 4 and 5 are poles of
        same.&nbsp; 6 and 7 are connections of high frequency
        transformer 8 for stepping up the frequency to 500,000 and the
        voltage to say 100,000. 9 is an inductance coil. 10 is the spark
        gap, and 11 is the adjustable condensor, while 12 is the primary
        winding of transformer 8 and 13 is the secondary winding of
        transformer 8. Secondary winding 8 goes to ground through lead
        wire 15 to adjustable condensor 16 and lead wire 17 and 18. 1`4
        is lead wire from the other side of secondary winding of
        transformer 8 to main transmission antenna 19 supported by
        insulating means 20. 21 is spark gap from transmission antenna
        19 to ground through lead wire 22, adjustable condensor 23, lead
        wire 24 to ground 24’. Transmission antenna 19 may be of any
        length desired. </p>
      <p>In Figure 2: 25 is a closed oscillating loop antenna of any
        desired length and for greatest efficiency is run parallel with
        transmission antenna 19 of Figure 1. 26 is lead to step down
        transformer 27, of which 27’ is the secondary, 28 is lead to
        adjustable condensor 29, lead 20 to ground 31. 32 is primary
        winding of transformer 27, 33 is adjustable condensor, and 34
        and 35 are windings of frequency transformers supplying current
        through leads 36 and 37 to motor 38,or other power devices. </p>
      <p>Having described the drawings, I will now describe the
        operation of my invention. Throw switch 3 connecting feed wires
        1 and 2 with transformer leads 6 and 7, adjust spark gap 10 and
        condensor 11 so that a frequency of 500,000 and 100,000 volts is
        delivered from secondary leads 14 and 15 of step up transformer
        8 of Figure 1. Next adjust spark gap 21 of transmission antenna
        14 so that all nodes and peaks are eliminated in the
        transmission of the 100,000 volts and 500,000 frequency along
        said antenna 14, by the surges occurring pass over the gap 21 to
        lead 22 to adjustable condensor 16 to lead 15 to secondary
        winding 13 of transformer 8. The oscillatory current of 100,ooo
        and frequency of 500,000 being of the same frequency as the
        earth generated currents and thus in tune with same, it
        naturally follows that accumulation of the earth currents will
        assimilate with the same tuned currents and frequency with those
        of the output from transformer 8 along wires 14, affording a
        reservoir of high frequency currents to be drawn upon by a tuned
        circuit having the same characteristics of 500,000 frequency
        capacity which is shown in Figure 2; the antenna 25 is tuned
        fundamentally to receive a frequency of 500,000 chich current
        passes to lead 26 through winding 27’ of transformer 27, thence
        to lead wire 28 through adjustable condensor 29 to lead wire 30
        to ground 31. The high frequency currents of 500,000 and voltage
        of 100,000 passes through to winding 32 and by adjustable
        condensor 33 and windings 34 and 35 of the frequency transformer
        27 is stepped down to a voltage and frequency suitable to
        operate motor 38 receiving current from leads 36 and 37. This
        makes available a current supply for any purpose whatever, such
        as operation of railway trains and current for industrial
        plants, lighting, heating, etc. </p>
      <p>The return of current through the earth from transmission
        antenna 14 is preferable to a metallic return as a higher
        percentage of accumulation of earth currents is noticeable on
        receiving antenna of Figure 2 than from a metallic return,
        accountable for because of the condensor effect the grounded
        circuit affords. </p>
      <p>I also prefer under certain conditions to sue a single antenna
        receiving wire in place of the closed loop shown in Figure 2.
        Under certain operation requirements I have found it expedient
        to have the transmission antenna elevated and carried on poles
        many feet above the earth, and in that case a different voltage
        and frequency was necessary to accumulate earth currents along
        the transmission antenna 14. </p>
      <p>What I claim is: </p>
      <p>1, In an Electrical Power Accumulator, a synchronized
        oscillatory circuit parallel with and in proximity to earth
        adapted to accumulate and utilize current generated by the
        earth. </p>

        current generated by the earth rotating on its axis. </p>

        currents. </p>

        currents and receiving means adapted to utilize said radiated
        earth accumulated currents, said means synchronized to pick up
        and utilize said radiated earth currents. </p>
      <p>5, In an Electrical Power Accumulator, a synchronized
        oscillatory circuit parallel with and in proximity to earth
        adapted to accumulate and utilize current generated by the earth
        using synchronized means to pick up at a distance therefrom said
        radiated earth currents. </p>
      <p>6, In an Electrical Power Accumulator, a synchronized
        oscillatory circuit having same frequency as the earth generated
        currents, said oscillatory circuit parallel with and in
        proximity to the earth, said oscillatory circuit adapted to
