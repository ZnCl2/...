      <p align="center"><b>TRANSLATOR'S PREFACE. </b> </p>
      <p>On the 16th October, 1816, at Bassing, in the department of
        Bas-Rhein, (France, since ceded to Germany), was born a child by
        whose name the nineteenth century will come to be known, as are
        the centuries of Copernicus, of Galileo and of Newton by their
        several names. Antoine Bechamp, the babe of 1816, died on the
        15th April, 1908, fourteen days after he was first visited by an
        aged American physician between whom and himself a
        correspondence had passed for several years on the subject of
        the researches and wonderful discoveries of Professor Bechamp
        and his collaborators. The American physician made his visit to
        Paris for the purpose of becoming personally acquainted with
        Professor Bechamp, who, as his family stated, had looked forward
        with eager anticipation to such a visit. </p>
      <p>The translator had long previously submitted to the professor
        an extensive summary of his physiological and biological
        discoveries, and by him it was revised and approved. </p>
      <p>This was intended to be introduced as a special chapter in an
        extensive work on inoculations and their relations to pathology,
        upon which the translator of this work had been engaged, almost
        exclusively, for some fourteen years. </p>
      <p>But in the lengthy and nearly daily interviews between
        Professor Bechamp and myself, which, as just shown, closely
        preceded the former's death, I suggested that instead of such
        summary it would be better to place before the English speaking
        peoples an exact translation into their language of some, at
        least, of the more important discoveries of Professor Bechamp,
        especially as, in my opinion, it would not be easy to carry out
        among them that "conspiracy of silence" by means of which the
        discoveries of Bechamp had been buried in favour of distorted
        plagiarisms of his labours which had been productive of
        abortions, such as the Microbian or Germ Theory of disease, "the
        greatest scientific silliness of the age," as it has been
        correctly styled by the Professor. </p>
      <p>To this suggestion Professor Bechamp gave hearty assent, and
        told me to proceed exactly as I might think best for the
        promulgation of the great truths of biology, physiology, and of
        pathology, discovered by him, and authorized me freely to
        publish either summaries or translations into English, as I
        might deem most advisable. </p>
      <p>In pursuance of this authorisation, the present volume is
        published, and is intended to introduce to peoples of the
        English tongue the last of the great discoveries of Professor
        Bechamp. </p>
      <p>The subject of the work is described by its title, but it is
        well to remind the medical and to inform the lay public, that
        the problem of the coagulation of the blood, so beautifully
        solved in this volume, has until now been an enigma and
        opprobrium to biologists, physiologists and pathologists. </p>
      <p>The professor was in his 85th year at the time of the
        publication of the work here translated. To the best of the
        translator's knowledge it has not yet been plagiarised and is
        the only one of the Professor's more important discoveries which
        has not been so treated; but at the date of its publication the
        arch plagiarist was dead, though his evil work still lives. </p>
      <p>One of the discoveries of Bechamp was the formation of urea by
        the oxidation of albuminoid matters.1 The fact, novel at the
        time, was hotly disputed, but is now definitely settled in
        accordance with Bechamp's view; his memoir described in detail
        the experimental demonstration of a physiological hypothesis of
        the origin of the urea of the organism, which had been supposed
        to proceed from the destruction of nitrogenous matters. </p>
      <p>1. Annales Physiques et Chimiques, 3d., Vol XLVIII p348 (1856)
        C.R. Vol XLIII p348</p>
      <p>By a long series of exact experiments he demonstrated clearly
        the specificity of the albuminoid matters and he fractionized
        into numerous defined species albuminoid matters described
        theretofore as constituting a single definite compound. </p>
      <p>He introduced new yet simple processes of experimentation of
        great value, which enabled him to publish a list of definite
        compounds and to isolate a series of soluble ferments to which
        he gave the name of zymases. To obscure his discoveries, the
        name of diastases has often been given to these ferments, but
        that of zymas must be restored. He also showed the importance of
        these soluble products (the zymases) which are secreted by
        living organisms. </p>
      <p>He was thus led to the study of fermentations. Contrary to the
        then generally received chemical theory, he demonstrated that
        the alcoholic fermentation of beer-yeast was of the same order
        as the phenomena which characterize the regular performance of
        an act of animal life - digestion. </p>
      <p>In 1856 he showed that moulds1 transformed cane sugar into
        invert sugar (glucose) in the same manner as does the inverting
        ferment secreted by beer yeast. The development of these moulds
        is aided by certain salts, impeded by others, but without moulds
        there is no transformation. He showed that a sugar solution
        treated with precipitated calcic carbonate does not undergo
        inversion when care is taken to prevent the access to it of
        external germs, whose presence in the air was originally
        demonstrated by him.2</p>
      <p>If to such a solution the calcareous rock of Mendon or Sens be
        added instead of pure calcic carbonate, moulds appear and the
        inversion takes place.3</p>
      <p style="background: white"> 1. Annales de physique et de Chimie,
        3d S., Vol. LIV, p. 28 (1858).<br>
        2. Repertoire de Chimie pure, Vol. I. p. 69 (1859).<br>
        3. Role de la craic dans les fermentations, Bull. Soc. chim.,
        Vol. VI. p. 484 (1866).</p>
      <p>These moulds, under the microscope, are seen to be formed by a
        collection of molecular granulations which Bechamp named
        microzymas. Not found in pure calcic carbonate, they are found
        in geological calcareous strata, and Bechamp established that
        they were living beings capable of inverting sugar, and some of
        them to make it ferment. He also showed that these granulations
        under certain conditions evolved into bacteria. </p>
      <p>To enable these discoveries to be appropriated by another, the
        name microbe was later applied to them, and this term is better
        known than that of microzyma; but the latter name must be
        restored, and the word microbe must be erased from the language
        of science into which it has introduced an overwhelming
        confusion. It is also an etymological solecism.a</p>
      <p>Bechamp denied spontaneous generation, while Pasteur continued
        to believe it. Later he, too, denied spontaneous generation, but
        he did not understand his own experiments, and they are of no
        value against the arguments of the sponteparist Pouchet, which
        could be answered only by the microzymian theory. So, too,
        Pasteur never understood either the process of digestion nor
        that of fermentation, both of which processes were explained by
        Bechamp, and by a curious imbroglio (was it intentional?) both
        of these discoveries have been ascribed to Pasteur. That Lister
        did, as he said, most probably derive his knowledge of
        antisepsis (which Bechamp had discovered) from Pasteur, is
        rendered probable by the following peculiar facts. In the
        earlier antiseptic operations of Lister the patients died in
        great numbers, so that it came to be a gruesome sort of medical
        joke to say that "the operation was successful, but the patient
        died." But Lister was a surgeon of great skill and observation,
        and he gradually reduced his employment of antiseptic material
        to the necessary and not too large dose, when his "operations
        were successful and his patients lived." </p>
      <p>[a. The Greeks used the term macrobe to signify persons whose
        lives were of long duration. By analogy, microbe would be
        appropriate to persons whose lives are of short duration.
        Bechamp proved that his microzymas were of immense longevity;
        hence to them the term macrobe might have been applicable,
        though that of microzyma, meaning small ferment, is not less so.
        So, contrasting the life term,—while the microzymas might be
        termed macrobes, men would be microbes. —Trans.]</p>
      <p>Had he learned his technique from the discoverer of antisepsis,
        Bechamp, he would have saved his earlier patients; but deriving
        it at second hand from a savant (?) who did not understand the
        principle he was plagiarizing,1 Lister had to acquire his
        subsequent knowledge of the proper technique through his
        practice, i.e., at the cost of his earlier patients. </p>
      <p>Bechamp carried further the aphorism of Virchow - Omnis cellula
        e cellula - which the state of microscopical art and science at
        that time had not enabled the latter to achieve. Not the cellule
        but the microzyma must, thanks to Bechamp's discoveries, be
        to-day regarded as the unit of life, for the cellules are
        themselves transient and are built up by the microzymas, which,
        physiologically, are imperishable, as he has clearly
        demonstrated. </p>
      <p>Bechamp studied the diseases of the silk worm then (1866)
        ravaging the Southern provinces of France and soon discovered
        that there were two of them - one, the pebrine, which is due to
        a parasite;2 the other, the flacherie, which is constitutional.
        A month later, Pasteur in a report to the Academy of his first
        silkworm campaign, denied the parasite, saying of Bechamp's
        observation, "that is an error." Yet in his second report, he
        adopted it, as though it were his own discovery! </p>
      <p>The foregoing is but a very imperfect list of the labors and
        discoveries of Bechamp, of which the work now translated was the
        crowning glory. </p>

      <p>The present work describes the latest of all the admirable
        biological discoveries of the Professor Bechamp. It is proposed
        to follow it up with a translation of The Theory of the
        Microzymas and the Microbian System now in course of
        translation; and The Microzymas, the translation whereof is
        completed. Other works will, it is hoped, follow, viz.: The
        Great Medical Problems, the first part of which is ready for the
        printer, Vinous Fermentation, translation complete; New
        Researches upon the Albuminoids, also complete, etc., etc. </p>
      <p>The study of these and of the other discoveries of Professor
        Bechamp will produce a new departure and a sound basis for the
        sciences of biology, of physiology and of pathology, today
        floating in chaotic uncertainty and confusion; and will, it is
        hoped, bring the medical profession back to the right path of
        investigation and of practice from which it has suffered itself
        to be led astray into the microbian theory of disease, which, as
        before mentioned, was declared by Bechamp to be the "greatest
        scientific silliness of the age." </p>

        and who deserves a place as one of the giants of the history of
        science. History, however, is written by the winners; the career
        of Antoine Bechamp, and the manner in which both he and his work
        have been written out of history, bear witness to the truth of
        this statement. </p>
      <p>During his long and distinguished career as an academic and a
        researcher in 19th century France, Antoine Bechamp was widely
        known as both a teacher and an innovator. His work was widely
        documented in scientific circles, and few made as much use of
        this fact as the now famous Louis Pasteur, who set about
        plagiarising and distorting Bechamp's ideas and discoveries, and
        in doing so gained for himself an undeserved and unwarranted
        place in the history of medical science. </p>
      <p>There have been several excellent books written (mainly in the
        early decades of this century), which explain in detail the
        plagiarisms and accompanying injustices which Pasteur and others
        inflicted on Bechamp. </p>
      <p>This present text, The Third Element of the Blood, is the
        injured party's own exposition of his position and his defence
        of it. It is a reworked translation of the last major work
        written by Professor Bechamp, and as such it describes the
        culmination of his life's work, and shows clearly the importance
        that his work should have with regard to contemporary medicine
        and science. </p>
      <p>This book contains, in great detail, the elements of the
        Microzymian theory of the organization of living organisms and
        organic materials. It has immediate and far reaching relevance
        to the fields of immunology, bacteriology, and cellular biology,
        and it shows that more than 100 years ago, the germ, or
        microbian, theory of disease was demonstrated by Bechamp and
        those who worked with him to be without foundation. </p>
      <p>The reader should be aware when reading The Third Element of
        the Blood that in formulating his microzymian theory of
        biological organisation, Bechamp in no way sought to establish
        it as the last word on the subjects of disease, its
        transmission, general physiology, or indeed the organisation of
        living matter itself. The Professor worked until a few weeks
        before his death; even if he were working now, he would no doubt
        still regard his work as unfinished. </p>
      <p>It is no accident but rather a vindication of the truth of
        Bechamp's theories that many researchers over the course of the
        twentieth century have arrived at hypotheses and conclusions in
        various disciplines that concur with the microzymian model. </p>
      <p>In the United States during the 1920s and 30s, Royal Rife's
        microscope revealed processes of life which would have made a
        great deal of sense to Bechamp. The medical establishment,
        however, was confounded by the implications of Rife's
        discoveries, especially so when he began curing diseases,
        including cancer, with electromagnetic frequencies. Rife and his
        discoveries were soon consigned to that special anonymity which
        is reserved for those who threaten the interests of a system
        which supports itself by maintaining a high level of sickness
        amongst humanity, and keeping health at a safe and lucrative
        distance. </p>
      <p>To maintain the profits of the drug companies and the authority
        of the medical establishment, no price is too great, and by the
        time Rife died, his work was all but forgotten. </p>
      <p>Another process, this time a more recent one called CanCell, is
        experiencing the same fate at the same hands. Using techniques
        which are very much a refinement and development of Rife's use
        of frequencies, Ed Sopcak has developed a process which has been
        tested and vindicated by the American FDA, who are now doing
        their best to bury it. Again, the danger of this technology
        seems to be that it works, against Aids and cancer as well as
        other diseases, and it is simple and cheap. For years, Sopcak
        has given CanCell away without charge to anyone who asked for
        it. Today he can no longer do so because of a groundless court
        injunction. </p>
      <p>Many of the "alternative" ideas of medicine and biology that
        are currently under attack in various parts of the world would
        have no argument with the views of Bechamp. And if science had
        granted to Bechamp the position in history and the influence
        upon scientific thought that it instead allowed to fall into the
        hands of the charlatan and opportunist Louis Pasteur, modern
        science would in turn have no argument with those ideas which
        today are being suppressed at every turn, whether by law,
        propaganda, discrimination, or, as in the latest development,
        armed raids, confiscation of equipment, and the jailing of
        researchers and health practicioners. </p>
      <p>One such unfortunate is Basil Wainright, an American
        responsible for a process known as polyatomic apheresis, an
        advanced form of oxygen therapy which has proven itself to be
        effective enough against Aids and cancer for it to be worth
        banning. At the time of writing, he has spent three years in
        prison without being charged with any offence, his medications
        for Parkinson's disease have been tampered with, and clinics
        using polyatomic apheresis have been raided and closed. </p>
      <p>Similar stories could be told concerning many other products
        and practices, including Essiac and other herbal therapies,
        which should have been greeted with open arms, but have instead
        been marginalised by the establishment. </p>
      <p>Among the many characteristics that these processes and
        theories have in common is the fact that the Germ Theory, that
        great and fallacious iconoclasm that Pasteur and his legions
        have cursed modern medical thinking with, plays no part in them.
        There is no hunt for the responsible bug, no expensive and
        complicated treatment for the sole cause of a disease. </p>
      <p>The Germ Theory is convenient because it provides what every
        simplistic view of a problem seeks before all else: a culprit,
        an invisible hare for the hounds to chase in their costly
        research labs, universities, hospitals, and drug factories. The
        fact that the hare can never be caught is the perfect guarantee
        that their race will never finish, their demands for funding
        will never cease, and their ability to generate profits for the
        drug and chemical corporations will continue to grow. </p>
      <p>There is no single cause of disease. The ancients thought this,
        Bechamp proved it and was written out of history for his
        trouble, and now the same thing is being done to those whose
        work, consciously or otherwise, carries on from where Bechamp's
        left off. The relevance of his work to the dilemmas that beset
        modern medical science remains as yet unrealised. </p>
      <p>This book is being republished with the intention of being one
        small element in the movement that will correct that situation.

          the prey of life. - The Author </i></p>
      <p>The historian of the founders of modern astronomy lately
        related that Cleanthus, a philosopher, three centuries before
        our era, wished to prosecute Aristarchus for blasphemy, for
        having believed that the earth moved, and dared to say the sun
        was the immovable center of the universe; that two thousand
        years later, human reason having remained stationary, the wish
        of Cleanthus was realized; Galileo having been accused of
        blasphemy and impiety for having, like Copernicus and following
        Aristarchus, maintained the same truth; "a tribunal dreaded by
        all, condemned his writings and forced him to a recantation
        which his conscience denied." </p>
      <p>The following is the judgement of the historian upon this
        event: "Never perhaps has the generous detestation of the public
        conscience for intolerance shone forth more strongly than around
        the name of Galileo. </p>
      <p>"The narrative of his misfortunes, exaggerated like a holy
        legend, has affirmed, while avenging him, the triumph of the
        truths for which he suffered; the scandal of his condemnation
        will forever vex in their pride those who would oppose force to
        reason; and the righteous severity of opinion will preserve its
        inconvenient remembrance as an eternal reproach thrown in their
        teeth to confound them". </p>
      <p>"The righteous severity of the judgement which preserves the
        inconvenient memory" of the sufferings of Galileo, it is well to
        mention, is that of the scholarly and learned members of
        Academies whereof the author forms part. It is agreed; yes,
        intolerance is odious and hateful, the situation of Galileo was
        particularly horrible. He was forced to go to church and
        pronounce with a loud voice the abjuration dictated to him: "I,
        Galileo, in the seventieth year of my age, on my knees before
        your Eminences, having before my eyes the holy gospels, which I
        touch with my own hands, I abjure, I curse, I detest the error
        and the heresy of the movement of the earth."&nbsp; There is no
        more atrocious torture than this brutal violence against the
        conscience of a man. It is the greatest abuse of force and pride
        when we know that it was the priests of Jesus Christ who
        perpetrated it. </p>
      <p>The theologians of the holy office were not competent to judge
        the astronomer Galileo, yet they in their ignorance undertook to
        proscribe an opinion which differed from their own, as being
        erroneous and contrary to the holy Scriptures, which, said the
        Popes, "were dictated by the mouth of God himself." In truth
        what did they know about it? Assuredly it is distressing to
        observe how long "human reason can remain at the same point"
        upon a given by experiment alone. </p>
      <p>It is interesting to know if the lesson taught by the
        condemnation of Galileo has been properly learned, and if three
        centuries later "the righteous severity of the judgement against
        those who would still resist the power of reason" would be able
        to protect those who labor disinterestedly for the triumph of
        the truth, if, in short, those who, for the large public, are as
        authoritative judges of the value of the discoveries of others,
        have become less intolerant, or, at least, more impartial, less
        prompt to pronounce against opinions which they do not share,
        less anxious to deny facts than to test them. And if the lesson
        has not been learned, it is not less interesting to examine if
        it is "human reason" which must be held responsible; if it be
        not rather "pettifogging" ratiocination, the abuse of reasoning
        warped by passion and too often by personal interest which
        overcomes private conscience and leads the public astray. </p>
      <p>The history of a discussion wherein chemistry and physiology
        closely united were interested, which agitated the second half
        of the century now closing (the 19th), is well adapted to show
        that human nature has not changed since the time of Cleanthus,
        and that there always exist persons ready to associate
        themselves together to contradict or insult the unfortunate
        wretch who has devised some new theory, based upon unsuspected
        facts, which would compel them to reform their arguments and
        abandon their prejudices. </p>
      <p>This work upon the blood, which I present at last to the
        learned public, is as the crown to a collection of works upon
        ferments and fermentation, upon spontaneous generation, upon
        albuminoid substances, upon organization, upon physiology and
        general pathology which I have pursued without relaxation since
        1854, at the same time with other researches of pure chemistry
        more or less directly related to them, and it must be added, in
        the midst of a thousand difficulties raised up by relentless
        opponents from all sides, especially whence I least expected
        them. </p>
      <p>To solve some very delicate problems I had to create new
        methods of research, of physiological, of chemical and
        anatomical analysis. Ever since 1857 these researches have been
        directed by a precise design to a determined end; the
        enunciation of a new doctrine regarding organization and life.
        It led to the microzymian theory of the living organisation,
        which has led to the discovery of the true nature of blood by
        that of its third anatomical element, and, at least, to a
        rational, natural explanation of the phenomenon called its
        spontaneous coagulation. But the microzymian theory, which is to
        biology what the Lavoisierian theory of matter is to chemistry,
        and is founded on the discovery of the microzymas, living
        organisms of an unsuspected category, has been attacked in its
        principle, by denying the very existence of the microzymas.
        Since this was so, if the assertion that the microzymian theory
        of the living organization gives to biology a base as solid as
        does the Lavoisierian theory to chemistry, be deemed imprudent,
        well, I choose to commit this imprudence, and to be imprudent to
        the end and to struggle against a current of opinion which is
        the more violent, as will be seen, the more it is artificial. </p>
      <p>It was the boldest of those who deny the fact of the existence
        of the microzymas who wrote: </p>
      <p>"Whenever it can be done, it is useful to point out the
        connection of new facts with earlier facts of the same order.
        Nothing is more satisfying to the mind than to be able to follow
        a discovery from its origin to its latest development." 1</p>
      <p>That is very well and very fine, the more so that the author
        took good care not to follow this wise precept; let us ascend
        then to the sources. </p>
      <p>Two centuries after Galileo we were still in the Aristotlelian
        hypothesis regarding matter, but reinforced by the alchemical
        hypothesis of transmutation and the Stahlian one of phlogiston.
        It was readily conceded that matter could of itself become
        living matter, animated, such as it is in plants and animals;
        thus it was that spontaneous generation was still generally
        admitted. Charles Bonnet himself said that organization was the
        most excellent modification of matter; nevertheless that learned
        naturalist and philosopher attempted to opposed spontaneous
        generation by imagining in turn the hypothesis of encapsulation
        and that of pre-existing germs universally diffused, whereof
        Spallanzani made use to refute the experiments and conclusions
        of the sponteparist Needham, member of the Royal Society of
        London. On the other hand, to sustain Needham, Buffon invented
        the hypotheses of organic molecules, not less universally
        diffused, whose substance, distinct from common matter, called
        raw matter, helped to explain the growth of plants and animals,
        as well as spontaneous generation.2</p>
      <p><i>1. L Pasteur, Annales de chimie et de physique, 3d S. Vol.
          LVIII, p. 371, note. </i><i><br>
        </i><i> 2. It is wrong to suppose that the word organic, in
          organic molecules, had the same meaning as in organic matters
          of modem chemists; this is so little the truth that Buffon
          admitted organic molecules to explain the crystallization of
          marine salt or of others, purely mineral</i></p>
      <p>Fermentations and ferments were very simply explained. Macquer
        in 1772, in agreement with the savants, regarded it as certain
        that vegetable and animal matters, abstracted from living
        organisms, under certain conditions of the presence of water, of
        contact, at least momentarily, of the air and of temperature,
        become altered of themselves, ferment, becoming putrid in
        producing the ferment. </p>
      <p>And according to the same principles it was said that water
        could transmute itself into earth, the earth into a poplar, and
        that the blood begets itself by the transmutation of flesh into
        the flowing liquor. </p>
      <p>Such in a few words was the condition of science upon these
        questions before the advent of Lavoisier. In the Lavoisierian
        theory there is no matter other than that of simple bodies,
        which are heavy, indestructible by the means at our disposal,
        always reappearing the same, not withstanding all the
        vicissitudes of their various combinations among themselves and
        the changes of states or allotropic modifications they might
        undergo. No transmutations and no phlogistication to explain the
        phenomena. </p>
      <p>In this theory, matter is only mineral, simple bodies being
        essentially mineral. There is no living or animal matter, no
        matter essentially organic. That which, long after the time of
        Lavoisier, chemists have called organic matters are only
        innumerable combinations in various proportions which carbon,
        hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen can form, often with other simple
        bodies at the same time, sulphur, phosphorus, iron, etc., carbon
        being always present, so that what is called organic matter in
        modern chemistry is only various combinations of carbon with the
        simple bodies mentioned. </p>
      <p>In fact, Lavoisier, after his demonstration that water did not
        become transmuted into earth, nor earth into plants, asserted
        that plants draw their food from the air, as was verified later.
        He even asserted that animals obtained the materials for their
        nutrition from plants, thus demonstrating that plants effected
        the synthesis of the substance without which animals could not
        exist. Even respiration was only a common phenomenon of
        oxidation. The substance of plants and that of animals being
        only combinations of carbon with hydrogen and oxygen, with the
        addition of nitrogen for animals, it is very interesting to
        recall shortly what Lavoisier thought of the putrefaction of
        these substances and of fermentation. </p>
      <p>Like everybody he knew that the juice of grapes and that of
        apples enters into fermentation of itself to produce wine or
        cider, and he wrote the following equation: </p>
      <p align="center">grape = must = carbonic acid + alcohol. </p>
      <p>To demonstrate this, he reduced the experiment to the
        employment of sugar, which he called a vegetable oxide, of water
        and of a ferment. The following is his account of the
        experiment: </p>
      <p>"To ferment sugar it must first be dissolved in about four
        parts of water. But water and sugar, no matter what proportions
        be employed, will not ferment alone, and equilibrium will
        persist between the principles (the simple bodies) of this
        combination if it be not broken by some means. </p>
      <p>A little yeast is sufficient to produce this effect and to give
        the first movement to the fermentation; it then continues of
        itself to the end. The effects of vinous fermentation reduced
        themselves to separating the sugar into two portions, to
        oxygenize the one at the expense of the other to produce
        carbonic acid of it; to deoxygenize the other in favour of the
        former to make alcohol of it; so that if it were possible to
        recombine the alcohol and carbonic acid, the sugar would be
        reformed." </p>
      <p>It is thus clear that Lavoisier instead of the equation
        regarding the must might have written thus: </p>
      <p align="center">sugar = carbonic acid + alcohol. </p>
      <p>Lavoisier intended to give elsewhere an account of the effects
        of yeast and of ferments in general, which he was prevented from
        doing. But it can be seen from his Treatise upon Elementary
        Chemistry, published in 1788, that he had established that yeast
        is a quarternary nitrogenized body, and that which remained of
        it at the end of the fermentation contained less nitrogen, and
        that besides the alcohol a little acetic acid was formed.
        Lavoisier also found that after distillation there remained a
        fixed residue representing about 4% of the sugar. We shall see
        later the importance of these remarks. </p>
      <p>It might thereafter have been anticipated that Lavoisier should
        explain the phenomena of the putrid fermentation of vegetable
        and animal substances "as operating by virtue of very
        complicated affinities" between the constituted principles of
        these substances (the simple bodies), which in this operation
        cease to be in equilibrium so as to be constituted into other
        compounds. </p>
      <p>Bichat, who died in 1802, at the age of 31, had been much
        struck by the results of the labors of Lavoisier. He could not
        accept a living matter constituted of pure chemical compounds
        whereof the simple elements are the constituent principles. He
        imagined, then, that the only living things in a living being
        are the organs composed of the tissues, whereof he distinguished
        twenty-one as elementary anatomical elements, as the elementary
        bodies are chemical elements. Such was the first influence of
        the Lavoisierian theory upon physiological anatomy; it was thus
        that in 1806 in the third edition of his "Philosophie Chimique"
        Fourcroy said: </p>
      <p>"Only the tissue of living plants, only their vegetating
        organs, can form the matters extracted from them, and no
        instrument of art can imitate the compositions which are
        prepared in the organized machines of plants." </p>
      <p>What marvellous and novel language! It is true that, a chemist
        rallying to the new theory, Fourcroy, like Bichat, was a
        physician. </p>
      <p>Let us bear in mind that Bichat had been led by the
        Lavoisierian theory of matter to lay down a new principle of
        physiology. As Galileo had laid down the metaphysical principle:
        "nothing is but what ought to be," Dumas drew from the chapter
        of fermentation of Lavoisier's treatise the following principle,
        which is also a necessary one: "nothing is created, nothing is
        lost." </p>
      <p>We have above rapidly sketched the state of the relations of
        chemistry and physiology as well as the state of the subject of
        fermentations at the beginning of the nineteenth century; we
        will now see what they were at the commencement of the second
        half of that century (say), about 1856. </p>
      <p>The chemists, thanks to direct analytical methods which were
        more and more perfected, isolated a great number of incomplex
        compounds, acids, alkaloids, neutral or having divers functions,
        from vegetable and animal substances, which incomplex compounds
        were more and more exactly specified under the name of proximate
        principles of plants and of animals, nitrogenized ternaries and
        quaternaries. </p>
      <p>Among the nitrogenized proximate principles a number of them
        were distinguished as soluble or insoluble, also
        uncrystallizable, such as the albumin of the white of egg and of
        the serum of blood, caseum (later called casein) of milk, the
        fibrin of the blood and that of the muscles, the gelatine of the
        bones, the gluten of wheat, the albumin of the juices of plants,
        etc. In process of time, the similarity of their composition and
        of certain of their common properties with the albumin of the
        white of egg led to these matters being formed into the groups
        of the albuminoid matters. Lavoisier knew these albuminoid
        matters only in so far as they were nitrogenized animal matters.
      </p>
      <p>Now after the discovery of gluten, of vegetable albumen,
        nitrogenized quaternaries like beer yeast, it was admitted that
        they were the ferment of vinous fermentation; then generalizing
        it came to be thought that albumin, the albuminoids in general,
        became or were directly the ferment; while the ternary proximate
        principles, such as cane sugar, grape sugar, milk sugar, the
        other sugars, amylaceous matter, inulin, gum, mannite, etc.,
        were called fermentescible matter. </p>
      <p>Matters had reached this point when about 1836, Cagniard de
        Latour, resuming the study of beer yeast1 and of its
        multiplication during the fermentation which produces beer,
        regarded it as organized and living, decomposing the sugar into
        alcohol and carbonic acid by an effect of its vegetation. </p>
      <div class="Section2">
        <p style="background: white">1. A study already made by
          Desmazieres, who regarded the globule of beer-yeast as an
          infusoria under the name of Mycoderma cerevisiae, but which
          Turpin called a plant under the generic name of Toruta and
          Kutzing under that of Cryptococcus.</p>
      </div>
      <p>That was a conception as original as that of Bichat. In effect
        it is not because of his having regarded beer yeast as organized
        and its multiplication during fermentation as a multiplication
        by vegetation, that the conception of Cagniard de Latour is
        original; it is because he admitted that the fermentation of the
        sugar operated by an effect of this vegetation, that is to say,
        owing to a physiological act. That was an absolutely new point
        of view; beer yeast, the only isolated ferment known, ceased to
        be regarded as a precipitate of albuminoid matter which had
        become insoluble, and was henceforth looked upon as a living
        being! Yeast ceased to be regarded as the reagent that Lavoisier
        had admitted as able to disturb the equilibrium of the simple
        bodies which constituted sugar. </p>
      <p>Also, soon after wards, Turpin, the botanist, interpreted the
        effect of the vegetation of Cagniard by saying that the globule
        of yeast was a cellule which decomposed sugar in nourishing
        itself. Dumas went further and asserted that the ferments, the
        yeast, behaved as do animals who feed, and that, for the orderly
        maintenance of the life of the yeast, there was needed, as for
        animals, besides sugar, nitrogenized albuminoid matter. </p>
      <p>In Germany, Schwann pronounce for the opinion of Cagniard de
        Latour while broadening the question; he supposed that no animal
        or vegetable substance altered of itself and that every
        phenomenon of fermentation presupposed a living ferment. To
        prove this he experimented as Spallanzani had done - improving
        upon his method, in order to demonstrate that the infusoria or
        ferments had their origin in the germs of the air. The
        experiments of Schwann were confirmed by several others. </p>
      <p>But the conception of Cagniard de Latour did not prevail, nor
        especially the interpretation of Turpin and of Dumas. It was not
        denied that infusoria or moulds existed in the mixtures in a
        state of alteration, but it was denied that they were the agents
        of the fermentation; this would begin of itself and the altered
        matter was regarded as evidence in favor either of spontaneous
        generation or of the production of these living products by the
        germs of the air. </p>
      <p>The discovery of diastase and of synapse, soluble and
        nitrogenized quaternaries like yeast, was held to legitimize the
        refusal to consider yeast as acting because it was organized and
        living. Now these substances being reagents of rare power for
        transforming certain fermentescible matters in aqueous solution,
        the transformations were called fermentation, and these reagents
        were called ferments; and it was said, you see that it is not
        because they are organized and living that the ferments act to
        effect the phenomena of fermentation. Then the opponents of the
        doctrine of Cagniard de Latour and of Schwann, with regard to
        fermentations and the relations of chemistry to physiology,
        triumphed so completely that opinions reverted to the point
        maintained in 1788. The principle of Bichat's doctrine was lost
        to view; not only was it admitted that vegetable and animal
        matters altered of themselves under the conditions specified by
        Macquer, but also the proximate principles extracted from them,
        even cane sugar, the aque ous solution whereof Lavoisier had
        declared to be unalterable. In short, the old hypothesis of
        germs of the air, which Schwann had revived, was completely lost
        to view. </p>
      <p>Nothing is better fitted to convince one that the human soul
        during the second half of the 19th century has remained the same
        as it was in the times of Galileo and of the inquisition, than
        to reflect upon the sequel of the history I have just sketched
        out.a &nbsp;I will now describe the fundamental experiment, the
        results whereof have completely changed the aspect of science
        with regard to the relations of chemistry and physiology with
        fermentation, such as they were still imagined to be at the end
        of the year 1857, after the theory of Cagniard de Latour in
        relation to yeast had been rejected. </p>

      </div>
      <p>In 1854 it was conceded that cane sugar dissolved in water
        altered of itself and became transformed into what is called
        invert sugar, because the solution which deviated the plane of
        polarization to the right deviated it to the left after the
        alteration. The inverted sugar was also called grape sugar. The
        phenomenon of this alteration was called inversion. </p>
      <p>With reference to other researches I resolved to verify the
        fact, and in the month of May, 1854, I left to themselves in a
        closed flask, in the presence of a small volume of air, at
        ordinary temperature, in a diffused light, some aqueous
        solutions of pure cane sugar. After several months I found that
        the sugar solutions in pure distilled water were partly
        inverted. At the beginning of 1855 I published the observation
        as a verification of the admitted fact, but I mentioned at the
        same time the presence of a mould in the inverting liquor. It is
        not an unusual thing to see moulds appear in aqueous solutions
        of the most diverse substances. That was why, in the then state
        of science and of the contradictory assertions regarding the
        experiments of Schwann, I would not assert anything beyond the
        fact. I noted merely that in the solutions to which I had added
        chloride of calcium, or chloride of zinc, the inversion had not
        taken place and no mould had appeared. To find an explanation of
        these differences I mad various experiments, commencing in 1855
        and continued them to the month of December, 1857. </p>
      <p>Among these experiments, all accordant with one another, I
        select two, because, reducing the problem to its simplest
        expression, they leave no room for doubt concerning the
        legitimacy of the conclusions I deduced from them. </p>
      <p>The first conclusion was that: the solution of cane sugar in
        distilled water remains indefinitely unchanged when, having been
        boiled, it is preserved in an absolutely full closed vase. </p>
      <p>The second was: The same solution, whether boiled or not, left
        in a closed vessel in the presence of a limited volume of air
        permits the appearance of colorless moulds, generally
        myceliennated, and the solution becomes completely inverted in
        the course of time, while the liquor reddens litmus paper, that
        is to say, becomes acid. To prove that the volume of air left in
        the closed flask has nothing to do with the inversion it
        suffices to add beforehand a small quantity of creosotea or a
        trace of sublimate of mercury to ensure that the liquid shall
        not become acid, or mouldy, and that the sugar will remain
        unchanged. </p>
      <div class="Section4">
        <p style="background: white"><i>[a. Here is the discovery and
            source of all that is true in the theory and practice of
            antisepsis; but it has been carried to absurd extremes by
            the dominant faction in medicine.—Trans.)</i></p>
      </div>
      <p>These two experiments demonstrated to me clearly that the
        presence of the air was essential for the inversion to take
        place and for the moulds to be born, and at the same time that
        the volume of air left present could not operate the inversion.
      </p>
      <p>It was then necessarily the developed moulds which were the
        agents of the phenomena observed. But myceliennated moulds are
        true microscopic plants, and consequently organized and living.
        I proved that they were nitrogenized and that, introduced into
        creosoted sugar water, they inverted the cane sugar much more
        rapidly than during their development. Nevertheless these moulds
        being insoluble, I asked myself how they do it? And I supposed
        that it was by an agent analogous to diastase and also thanks to
        the acid formed; but I have since demonstrated that it was
        indeed chiefly by means of a soluble ferment which they contain
        and which they secrete. And the presence of this soluble
        ferment, and consequently of an albuminoid matter, explained to
        me how, being nitrogenized, the moulds, when heated with caustic
        potash, set free an abundance of ammonia. </p>
      <p>But these moulds being nitrogenized could not be born of the
        cane sugar, which I have proven to be exempt from nitrogen. Now
        besides this sugar there was nothing present but distilled
        water, the mineral substance of the glass, and no other nitrogen
        than that of the air left in the closed flask; now (thanks to a
        little creosote or mercuric chloride) the experiment itself
        showed that these materials could not unite of themselves, by
        synthesis, to produce the substance of the moulds. Nothing then
        remained to explain the birth of the organized productions than
        the old hypothesis of germs; pretended germs, which allowed me
        no rest until I had discovered their origin and nature. </p>
      <p>While waiting to specify them, I admitted that under the
        conditions of the experiment "germs brought by the air found in
        the sugared solution a favorable medium for their development1;
        a development during which the new organism, making use of the
        materials present, effects the synthesis of the nitrogenized and
        non-nitrogenized materials of its substance. </p>
      <div class="Section5">
        <p style="background: white"><i>1. Annales de chimie et de
            physique, 3d S., Vol. LIV, p. 28 (1858).</i></p>
      </div>
      <p>Under the conditions of the experiment such as I have reported,
        where there are no other mineral matters than those of the
        glass, the crop of organized production is necessarily very
        small, and the inversion as well as the transformations which
        follow it are very slow. </p>
      <p>The addition of certain salts or of creosote hinders the
        inversion by preventing the development of the germs, either by
        rendering the medium sterile or by acting directly upon the
        former. </p>
      <p>But the addition of certain other purely mineral salts, even of
        arsenious acid, had the effect of increasing the harvest and of
        singularly hastening the inversion and the other phenomena of
        fermentation which follow it, for if the reaction is prolonged,
        the acid of which I have spoken above is found to be acetic
        acid, with, in certain cases, lactic acid, and alcohol in all
        cases; but to determine the production of this last the mould
        must be allowed to act for several years. </p>
      <p>It was thus that I was able to establish that the study made in
        1857 was really a phenomenon of fermentation, for the
        manifestation whereof it had not been necessary to employ
        albuminoid matter, but which, on the contrary, was produced from
        these matters. </p>
      <p>In its simplicity, the experiment was of the same order, for
        physiological chemistry, as had been the observation of Galileo
        with regard to the lamp, hung by a long cord, which oscillated
        slowly before the altar of the cathedral of Pisa. From that
        oscillation it was learned that it always beat the same measure,
        that the duration of the oscillation is independent of its
        amplitude and Huyghens discovered the law of the pendulum's
        oscillation by connecting it with the galleon principle of
        falling bodies. The consequences which have sprung from the
        above experiment have not been less fruitful; some day doubtless
        there will come a genius like to that of Huyghens to extend them
        and increase their fruitfulness; Meanwhile the following are
        some which I have been able to deduce from it, either in 1857 or
        subsequently while continuing to experiment. The chief and
        essential facts of the memoir of 1857 are the following: </p>
      <p>Cane sugar, a proximate principle, in watery solution, is
        naturally unalterable, even in contact with a limited volume of
        air, when the solution has been previously creosoted. </p>
      <p>The solution of cane sugar in contact with a like limited
        volume of air permits the appearance of moulds and the sugar is
        altered, first of all becoming inverted. </p>
      <p>If the solution has first had creosote added to it, moulds do
        not appear and the sugar is not altered. </p>
      <p>The fact that moulds develop in sugared water, in contact with
        a small limited quantity of air, forms the verification of the
        hypothesis of atmospheric germs; in no other way can that fact
        be explained. </p>
      <p>Developed moulds invert the cane sugar, even when the solution
        has first been creosoted; that is to say, the creosote which
        hinders the moulds from being born does not prevent them when
        born, from acting. Moulds being insoluble by reason of their
        being organized, effect the inversion by means of an agent
        analogous to diastase; that is to say, by means of a soluble
        ferment. </p>
      <p>The totality of the phenomena of the non-spontaneous alteration
        of cane sugar and of the production of an acid and of alcohol,
        prove it to be a fermentation both of moulds and of ferments.1</p>
      <div class="Section6">
        <p style="background: white">1. I have called by the name of
          moulds the totality of the productions which have appeared in
          different experiments which I have diversified; thus, although
          generally these moulds remained in the state of colorless
          mycelium, even in solutions to which arsenious acid and
          certain salts had been added, in others the completely
          developed mould was green or gray and rarely red. In some
          experiments there were actual cellules, different both from
          yeast globules and from the ferment of the lees of wine.
          Generally, at the beginning of the experiment, there was a
          slight deposit before the appearance of the mycelian tubes; in
          some cases, the inversions were effected by the "isolated
          little bodies," little bodies which I had not known how to
          classify, but which I held to be organized and living because,
          like the mycelian moulds, they effected the inversion of the
          sugar even in a creosoted solution.</p>
      </div>
      <p>And these facts, studied more attentively, showed clearly,
        contrary to what had before been believed, that albuminoid
        matter was not necessary for the birth of these ferments; then
        that the soluble ferments were not the products of the
        alteration of some albuminoid matter, since the mould produced
        at once the albuminoid matter and the soluble ferment in virtue
        of its physiological functions of development and nutrition. </p>
      <p>Thence it resulted that the soluble ferment was allied to the
        insoluble by the relation of product to producer; the soluble
        ferment being unable to exist without the figured ferment, which
        is necessarily insoluble. </p>
      <p>Further, as the soluble ferment and the albuminoid matter,
        being nitrogenized, could only be formed by obtaining the
        nitrogen from the limited volume of air left in the flasks, it
        was at the same time demonstrated that the free nitrogen of the
        air could help directly in the synthesis of the nitrogenized
        substance of plants; which up to that time had been a disputed
        question. </p>
      <p>Thenceforward it became evident that since the synthesis of the
        materials of the substance of moulds, of ferments, is
        necessarily produced by intussusception within the organism of
        these moulds, it must necessarily be that all the products of
        fermentation are there produced and that they are secreted
        therein as was secreted the soluble ferment which inverted the
        cane sugar; hence I became assured that that which is called
        fermentation is, in reality, the phenomenon of nutrition
        assimilation, dissimulation, and excretion of the products
        dissimulated. </p>
      <p>Without doubt these views were in conformity with the
        conceptions of Canard de Latour, even to those of Schwann and to
        the more precise view of Turpin and especially of Dumas; but in
        complete disagreement with those of their opponents, Liebig and
        his followers, some of whom denied that yeast was living, and
        held it to be nitrogenous matter in a state of decomposition,
        others that it acted in so far as it was nourished, by an action
        of extalyic contact, an occult cause, that it effected the
        decomposition of sugar in the same manner as platinum that of
        oxygenated water. </p>
      <p>We must then demonstrate that that which was true of the moulds
        was so in the same sense as in the case of beer yeast and of the
        ferment of the lees of wine; that is to say, that the cellules
        of these ferments invert cane sugar under the same conditions,
        in spite of the creosote, and before any other phenomenon of
        transformation is produced; it is found, in effect, that the
        yeast contains the soluble ferment which inverts, as the mould
        also contains it. </p>
      <p>Nevertheless the opponents of the conception of Cagniard de
        Latour and of Schwann could always object that if the creosote
        prevents the cane sugar from being altered, it would not be the
        same in the case of a mixture containing albuminoid matter; that
        consequently, if in the mixture of sugared water and of beer
        yeast, the cane sugar was inverted, it was because beer yeast,
        an albuminoid substance, continued to be altered in spite of the
        creosote. </p>
      <p>I replied by demonstrating that under the same conditions as
        the cane sugar all the true proximate principles, including
        therein soluble and insoluble albuminoids, even the most complex
        mixtures of proximate principles, remained unchanged, nothing
        organized appearing in them; provided that in the cases wherein
        cane sugar is present, the inverting soluble ferment does not
        exist among these proximate principles, because creosote does
        not prevent double ferments from reacting. </p>
      <p>Two contemporary experiments of that fact greatly impressed me.
      </p>
      <p>The first relates to milk. Everybody except Dumas regarded milk
        as an emulsion, as a pure mixture of proximate principles. Now,
        it is known that, like blood, it alters and clots after it is
        drawn, of itself, as Macquer said in the last century (the
        18th). This furnished an opportunity to verify the fact of the
        unchangeableness of mixtures of proximate principles when
        creosoted. The milk of a cow was then creosoted while being
        drawn, by receiving it into vessels washed with boiling
        creosoted water divided into three portions; one of which was
        left with a limited volume of air present; a second was left
        without any, and in the third the air was expelled by a current
        of carbonic acid gas. To my very great surprise, the milk
        altered, became sour and clotted, almost as quickly as if no
        creosote had been added. At last, which surprised me most of
        all, shortly after the coagulation was completed, there was a
        crowd of bacteria in every part of the clot. </p>
      <p>The second relates to the chalk which chemists employed, as
        calcic carbonate, in their experiments even upon fermentation,
        and which, like them, I employed to preserve the neutrality of
        the media. Now, one day, some starch made of potato facula had
        some chalk added to it to prevent it turning sour and was left
        in an oven at 4 to 45 degrees C.(= 104 to 113 degrees F.). I
        expected to find the starch with the same consistency as before;
        on the contrary, it was liquefied. "The germs of the air," said
        I. I repeated the experiment, creosoting the boiling starch and
        added some of the same chalk; again liquification! Much
        astonished I repeated the experiment, replacing the chalk with
        pure artificial calcic carbonate; this time the creosoted starch
        was not liquified, and I preserved it in this state for ten
        years. </p>
      <p>These two experiments, in their simplicity, were of the same
        order, equally fundamental as that of the inversion of sugar by
        moulds, but they embarrassed me much more. It was not until
        after other researches and after having varied and controlled
        them that I placed them before the learned societies of
        Montpellier (1863) and informed Dumas of them in a letter which
        he thought fit to publish,1 wherein I stated that some of the
        calcareous earthy and milk contained living beings already
        developed. </p>

      <p>And here are three other experiments, not less fundamental,
        which verify the first three: </p>
      <p>(1).&nbsp; I had ascertained that in the fermentation of cane
        sugar by moulds born of atmospheric germs, in a watery solution
        of sugar, acetic acid is produced; why is it not also produced
        in fermentation by beer yeast? And I shall prove that there is,
        in fact, produced at the same time only a very small quantity of
        acids homologous to acetic acid. </p>
      <p>(2).&nbsp; Beer yeast inverting cane sugar as do moulds, I
        tried to isolate from the yeast the soluble ferment it produces,
        as one can readily obtain as much beer yeast as may be required.
        I will say here how I proceeded to isolate it directly. Brewery
        yeast, pure, washed and drained, was treated with powdered cane
        sugar in suitable quantity; the mixture of the two bodies became
        liquefied and the sugar was entirely dissolved, so that the
        product of the liquefaction being thrown upon a filter, if the
        operation is performed on a sufficiently large quantity, permits
        the flowing off of an abundant limpid liquid before any
        indication of fermentation is manifested. The filtered liquid,
        being treated with alcohol, furnishes (as does an infusion of
        sprouted barley to precipitate its diastase) a rather
        considerable white precipitate, whereof the part soluble in
        water is the required soluble ferment. There could be no further
        doubt, this soluble ferment forms part of the very substance of
        the content of the cellule of the yeast. I gave it the name
        first of zymas, and later that of zythozymas. </p>
      <p>(3).&nbsp; The cellule of yeast, being a living organism,
        ought, being insoluble, to possess a vital resistance and should
        permit only such things to issue from its being as were
        disassimilated in it. Now, in effect, pure yeast, subjected to a
        methodical washing with distilled water, yields to it at first
        scarcely anything, only a trace of zythozymas and phosphoric
        acid. But there comes a time when it yields enormously, then
        less and less, until it has lost nearly 92% of its substance,
        preserving its form with its tegument distended with water.</p>
      <p>This observation suggested the making upon yeast the famous
        experiment of Chossat upon starving dogs. To compel the yeast to
        dwell in pure water would be to deprive it of nourishment; to
        submit it to a regimen of starvation would force it to devour
        itself. Pure yeast, steeped in creosoted distilled water,
        absolutely protected from air, disengages pure carbonic acid for
        a long time, producing alcohol, acetic acid, etc.; and at the
        same time other compounds which it does not make when nourished
        upon sugar. It exhausts itself thus enormously, remains whole a
        long time, its tegument preserving its form and, having
        eliminated its content almost wholly, inverts cane sugar to the
        end. I thus demonstrated that notwithstanding the creosote, the
        yeast alters of itself, as does the milk. </p>
      <p>The spontaneous alteration of milk and that of yeast seemed to
        me indisputable proof that neither milk nor yeast was a mixture
        of proximate principles, but that both of them contain,
        inherently, the living organised agent which is the cause of
        their spontaneous alteration, or that consequently, if the chalk
        liquefies fecula starch, it is because it contains that which
        can produce the necessary soluble ferment. </p>
      <p>It was the experiment of starving the yeast which enabled me to
        complete the demonstration that the phenomenon called the
        fermentation of cane sugar by yeast was the digestion of the
        sugar by the zymas, the absorption of the digested (invert)
        sugar by the cellule, the decomposition of this sugar in the
        cellule being the result of the complex phenomenon of
        assimilation, followed necessarily by disassimilation and of
        elimination; the products eliminated being carbonic acid,
        alcohol, acetic acid, etc., the same as with man the products of
        disassimilation, urea, etc., come from man and reunite in part
        in urine. </p>
      <p>While I was thus experimenting to develop the consequences of
        the memoir of 1857 and discovered the zythozymas in the yeast, I
        also discovered anthozymas in flowers, morozymas in the white
        mulberry, the nefrozymas of the kidneys in the urine as a
        product of the function of the kidneys, in order to demonstrate
        that as the moulds form and secrete their soluble ferment,
        plants and animals form theirs in their organs, and I shall
        demonstrate besides that the leukocytes of pus even produce a
        zymas in the pus. </p>
      <p>The phenomenon called fermentation is then the phenomenon of
        nutrition, which is being accomplished in the ferment, in the
        cellule of the yeast, in the same manner as the phenomenon of
        nutrition is accomplished in the animal, and following the same
        mechanism by the same means; this was the fundamental idea of my
        memoir "Upon fermentations by organized ferments" which dates
        from 1864.1</p>
      <p><i>1. CR Vol LVIII p601 (4 April 1864)</i></p>
      <p>I will revert later, with details, to this work, which also is
        fundamental. I mention it now only as a verification of the
        conception of Dumas of which mention has before been made; it
        was in that work that for the first time the word zymas is
        employed to designate the soluble ferment which yeast contains
        performed, distinguishing the soluble ferments as agents of a
        different order from the figured ferments and effecting
        transformations also of a different order. </p>
      <p>For the history one should read, in the Jahresbericht of
        Heinrich Will for 1864, how this was regarded as new in Germany
        and was favourably appreciated. </p>
      <p>It is difficult, however, to realize the resistance which was
        offered from many sources to the demonstration that the
        phenomenon of fermentation is a phenomenon of nutrition
        accomplishing itself in the ferment. It was simple because,
        although M.Virchow had held that the cellules were living in a
        living organism, the conception of Bichat was more and more
        regarded as unacceptable and the hypothesis of the cellularists
        as unfounded. </p>
      <p>Alfred Estor, who was interested in my researches, in giving an
        account of them in 1865, expressed himself as follows: </p>
      <p>"It is easy to perceive the tendencies of M. Bechamp; each
        cellule lives like a globule of yeast; each cellule should
        modify by use the materials of nutrition which surround it, and
        the general history of the phenomena of nutrition teaches us
        that these modifications are due to ferments. We know what
        emotion has welcomed the admirable works of Virchow upon
        cellular pathology; in the remarkable researches of the
        Montpellier professor there is to be found nothing less than the
        foundations of a cellular physiology." 1</p>
      <p><i>1. Montpellier, Le messager du Midi (1865)</i></p>
      <p>Seven years had passed since the publication of the memoir upon
        the inversion of cane sugar by moulds, when Estor delivered this
        judgement and when I wrote to J.B.Dumas the letter upon living
        agents which, in the milk, effect its spontaneous alteration and
        which, in the chalk, effect the liquefaction and fermentation of
        fecula starch. The year following I first named the microzymas
        in the Comptes Rendus of the Academy of Sciences to designate
        the ferments of the chalk. </p>
      <p>It has been know since the time of Leuwenhoeck (17th century)
        that human saliva is peopled with a great number of microscopic
        organisms long since recognized as vibrioniens, but which in a
        cleanly kept mouth I have found to be chiefly microzymas. I
        supposed that, even as the "little bodies" inverted cane sugar
        in the experiments of 1857, these microzymas might be those
        which produced the salivary diastase of Miathe in the saliva. I
        interested Estor and Camille Saintpiere in this question, and in
        1867 we addressed a note to the Academy, having this title: "On
        the role of the microscopic organisms of the mouth in digestion
        in general, and particularly in the formation of the salivary
        diastase." The note was sent for examination to a commission
        composed of Louget and Robin, who made no report, and the note
        was mentioned in the Compte Rendu in the following terms: </p>
      <p>"The conclusion of this work is that it is not by an alteration
        that the parotidian saliva becomes able to digest fecula, but by
        means of a zymas which the organisms of Leuwenhoeck secrete
        there, while nourishing themselves upon its materials." 1</p>
      <p><i>1. CR Vol LXIV p696 (1867)</i></p>
      <p>We demonstrated two facts equally essential, viz., that the
        buccal microzymas of man liquify and saccharify the starch of
        fecula with rare energy; that the parotidian saliva of the dog
        or horse can also liquify starch, but does not saccharify it,
        while such as has stayed upon the buccal organisms soon becomes
        as saccharifying as human saliva. </p>
      <p>The short note inserted by the commissioners shows that they
        had no idea of a zymas produced as function of a cellule, of a
        vibrionien, or of a microzyma, nor even of an organ. Here is an
        indisputable proof thereof: the pancreas was known and it was
        called an intestinal salivary gland. Now Bernard and Berthelot,
        studying the pancreatic juice and isolating from it the soluble
        substance called pancreatin, never thought for a moment to
        compare it to the salivary diastase, although possessing, to the
        same degree, the power of saccharifying the starch of fecula;
        that is that Bernard, contrary to the opinion of Longet and of
        Mialhe, held the salivary diastase, according to the ideas of
        Liebig, to be an animal matter in a condition of alteration,
        etc. </p>
      <p>The microzymas being discovered, the general demonstration was
        made that the soluble ferments were substances produced by a
        living organism, mould, yeast, geological microzyma, diverse
        flowers, a fruit, the kidneys, and the buccal microzymas. But
        these were only the preliminaries of the researches, whereof the
        totality have, since 1867, enabled the microzymian theory of the
        living organism to be formulated. </p>
      <p>After our joint experiment upon the buccal microzymas, I showed
        Estor an experiment in which a piece of muscle placed in fecula
        starch, after having liquefied it and commenced to make it
        ferment, caused bacteria to appear in it as they appeared in
        soured and clotted milk. He then became my collaborator in
        proving that which was true of milk and meat was also true for
        all the parts of an animal. There has resulted from this, thanks
        to other collaborations and other researches subsequent to 1870,
        "the microzymian theory of the living organism, the construction
        whereof is completed by the present work."</p>
      <p>The new theory rests upon a collection of fundamental and new
        facts which may by ranged under the following heads: </p>
      <p>1. The verification of the old hypothesis of atmospheric germs
        and of the ideas of Cagniard de Latour and of Schwann regarding
        the nature of beer yeast. </p>
      <p>Proof that the ferments are not the fruits of spontaneous
        generation. </p>
      <p>Demonstration that the soluble ferments or zymas are not the
        products of some change of an albuminoid matter, but the
        physiological products of a living organism; in short, that the
        relation of a mould, of beer yeast or of a cellule and of a
        microzyma with the zymases, is that of producer to a product. </p>
      <p>2. The distinguishing of organic matters reduced to the
        condition of definite proximate principles (that is to say, of
        the organic matter of the chemists, which is not living) from
        natural organic matters, such as they exist in animals and
        plants; that is to say, of the organic matter of physiologists
        and of anatomists which is reputed living or as having lived.
        The proximate principles are naturally unalterable, do not
        ferment even when (being creosoted) they are left in contact
        with a limited quantity of ordinary air, in water at a
        physiological temperature. On the other hand, natural organic
        matters, under the like conditions or absolutely protected from
        atmospheric germs, invariably alter and ferment. </p>
      <p>3. Demonstration that natural organic matters are spontaneously
        alterable, because they necessarily and inherently contain the
        agents of their spontaneous alteration, viz.: productions
        similar to those which I called "little bodies" in certain
        experiments upon sugared water, and "the living beings already
        developed," in the letter of 1865 to Dumas, and to which I gave
        the name of microzymas the following year, as being the smallest
        of ferments, often so small that they could only be seen under
        the strongest enlargements of the immersion objectives of
        Nachet, but which I had discovered to be the most powerful of
        ferments.</p>
      <p>What does this similitude of form and of function mean? What
        was there in common between a microzyma proceeding from a germ
        of the air, a microzyma of the chalk, a microzyma of the milk
        and those of natural organic matters? Ever since 1870 all my
        efforts have been directed to its discovery. My joint researches
        with Estor, later those of Baltus, upon the source of pus; those
        of J. Bechamp upon the microzymas of the same animal at its
        various ages and my own, especially those upon milk, upon eggs
        and upon the blood, have led me to consider the microzymas not
        only as being living ferments producers of zymases, like the
        moulds born in sugared water, but as belonging to a category of
        unsuspected living beings without analogy, whose origin is the
        same. In fact: </p>
      <p>On the one hand, all these researches showed me these
        microzymas functioning like anatomical elements endowed with
        physiological and chemical activity in all the organs and humors
        of living organisms in a perfect state of health, preserved
        there morphologically alike and functionally different, ab ovo
        et semine, in all the tissues and cellules of the diverse
        anatomical systems, down to the anatomical element which I have
        called microzymian molecular granulation. And especially they
        showed me that the cellule is not the simple vital unit that
        Virchow believed, because the cellule itself has microzymas as
        anatomical elements. </p>
      <p>On the other hand, the experiment showed me that in parts
        subtracted from the living animal, the microzymas being no
        longer in their normal conditions of existence, produced therein
        chemical alterations, called fermentations, which inevitably led
        to tissue disorganizations, to the destruction of the cellules
        and to the setting free of their microzymas, which then,
        changing in form and function, could become vibrioniens by
        evolution,which they did whenever the conditions for this
        evolution were realized. </p>
      <p>And, in the third place, I established that the vibrios, the
        bacteria which the anatomical microzymian elements had become,
        destroyed themselves, and that, with the aid of the oxygen of
        the air, under the conditions which I had realized, they were at
        last reduced to microzymas while the matters of the alteration,
        being oxidized, were transformed into water, carbonic acid,
        nitrogen, etc.; that is to say, restored to the mineral
        condition, so that of the natural organic matters and of their
        tissues and cellules there remained only the microzymas. And
        these microzymas, proceeding from the bacteria which the
        anatomical element microzymas had become, were identical,
        morphologically and functionally, with those of the chalk, of
        the calcareous rocks, of the alluviums, of the waters, of arable
        or cultivated earths, or the dusts of the streets and of the
        air. From these experiments I argued that the microzymas of the
        chalk, etc., were the microzymas of the bacteria which the
        anatomical element microzymas of the living beings of the
        geological epochs had become! </p>
      <p>We then have to consider: </p>
      <p>1. The microzymas in their function as anatomical elements in
        the living and healthy organism; there they are the
        physiological and chemical agents of the transformations which
        take place during the process of nutrition. </p>
      <p>2. Microzymas in natural organic matter abstracted from the
        living animal, or in the cadaver; they are there the agents of
        the changes which are ascertained to take place there, whether
        or not they undergo the vibrionien evolution; changes which go
        on to the destruction of the tissues and of the cellules. </p>
      <p>3. The microzymas of the bacteria which result from this
        evolution, which are essentially ferments productive of lactic
        acid, acetic acid, alcohol, etc., with sugar and fecula starch;
        these microzymas are also producers of zymases and capable of
        again undergoing vibrionien evolution.</p>
      <p>Whence, the microzymas being the anatomical elements of the
        organized being from its first lineaments in the ovule which
        will become the egg, I am able to assert that the microzyma is
        at the commencement of all organization. And the microzymas of
        the destroyed bacteria being also living, it follows that these
        microzymas are the living end of all organization. The
        microzymas are surely then living beings of a special category
        without analogue. </p>
      <p>But that is not all. Estor and I demonstrated that in a
        condition of disease the microzymas which have become morbid
        determine in the organism special changes, dependent upon the
        nature of the anatomical system, which lead alike to the
        disorganization of the tissues, to the destruction of the
        cellules and to their vibrionien evolution during life. </p>
      <p>So that the microzymas, living agents of all organization, are
        also the agents of disease and death under the influences which
        nosologists specify; finally they are the agents of total
        destruction when the oxygen of the air intervenes. Like the
        indestructible atom or element in the Lavoisierian theory of
        matter, the microzymas, too, are physiologically imperishable. </p>
      <p>From the experimental fact that the microzymas of the chalk and
        dusts of the air are only microzymas from bacteria which
        proceeded from the vibrionien evolution of the anatomical
        element microzymas, it follows, that that which I have called
        germs in my verification of the old hypothesis of germs of the
        air, are not pre-existenta in the air, in the earth and in the
        waters, but are the living remains of organisms which have
        disappeared and been destroyed. </p>
      <div class="Section8">
        <p style="background: white"><i>[The "experimental fact"
            referred to in the text (the very highest form of all
            evidence which can be supplied by science) cuts away the
            entire fabric of the Microbian theory of disease from its
            very foundation. Never having been other than a baseless
            guess on the part of Pasteur and of his followers, it was
            fittingly designated by the master as "the greatest
            scientific silliness of the age." It and the other
            "experimental facts" learnedly elaborated by Professor
            Bechamp and his collaborators make patent the absurdity of
            all pretended prophylactics against disease save one, and
            casts all rational minds back to the one sure and only
            protection — sound hygiene!</i><i><br>

            inoculations and other devices for "conveying" the products

            beguiled. The opponents of a truly rational medicine are
            many and powerful, as evidenced by the suppression for more
            than a generation of Bechamp's admirable discoveries beneath
            a "conspiracy of silence," and these opponents of the art of
            healing are entrenched in nearly all medical schools, in
            richly endowed Research Institutes, in expensive
            manufactories of animal poisons for poisoning men and
            animals (under the ignorant belief that they are benefitting
            us), and in all medical officialdom!—Trans.]</i></p>
      </div>
      <p>The facts of the microzymian theory have legitimatized the
        genial conception of Bichat, that the only thing living in an
        organism is what he regarded as elementary tissues. Later, among
        cellularists, Virchow, following Gaudichaut, held that the
        cellule was the simple anatomical element from which proceeded
        the whole of a living being; but it is in vain that he contended
        that it is the vital unit, living per se, because every cellule,
        even that of beer yeast, is transitory, destroying itself
        spontaneously. </p>
      <p>It is the microzyma which enables us to specify precisely
        wherein a tissue, a cellule is living; living per se - that is
        to say, autonomically, it is in truth the simple vital unit. </p>
      <p>But the conception had none the less as a consequence the
        assertion that, in disease, it is the elementary tissues or the
        cellules which are affected. Now tissue and cellular physiology
        being established in accordance with the prevision of Estor, it
        should result therefrom that tissue and cellular pathology are
        in reality microzymian pathology. In disease the cellules have
        been seen to change, be altered and destroyed, and these facts
        have been noted. But if the cellule were the vital unit living
        per se it would know neither destruction nor death, but only
        change. If then the cellule can be destroyed and die, while the
        microzyma can only change, it is because the microzyma is really
        living per se, and physiologically imperishable even in its own
        evolutions, for, physiologically, nothing is the prey of death;
        on the contrary, experience daily proves, that everything is the
        prey of life, that is to say, of what can be nourished and can
        consume. </p>
      <p>From the beginning of our researches Estor and I have
        established the presence of microzymas in the vaccine matter, in
        syphilitic pus as in ordinary pus, and I have shown in pus (even
        laudable) the presence of a zymas. In diseases there is then a
        morbid evolution of some anatomical element which corresponds to
        a vicious functioning and to the vibrionien evolution. It is
        thus that in anthrax the morbid microzymas of the blood become
        the bacteria of Davaine, and the blood globules experience such
        remarkable changes. but even as the microzymas may become
        morbid, they may cease to be so; for instance, there is a
        leading observation of Davaine upon the non-transmissibility of
        anthrax even by inoculation; if the animal be in process of
        putrefaction its blood can no longer communicate anthrax. </p>
      <p>From this observation of Davaine I draw the conclusion that
        normal air never contains morbid microzymas, what used to be
        called germs of diseases and now microbes; maintaining in accord
        with the old medical aphorism that diseases are born of us and
        in us, that no one has ever been able to communicate a
        characteristic disease of the nosological class, anthrax,
        smallpox, typhoid fever, cholera, plague, tuberculosis,
        hydrophobia, syphilis, etc., by taking the germ in the air, but
        necessarily from a patient, at some particular moment. And
        within the limit of my own studies upon the silkworms I
        distinguished with care the parasitic diseases whereof the agent
        came from outside, such as the muscardine and the pebine, from
        constitutional diseases, such as the flacherie, which is
        microzymian. </p>
      <p>I give in the postscript of this work the communication which I
        made to the Academy of Medicine the 3rd May, 1870, upon Les
        Microzymas, la Pathologie et la therapeutique. It will help to
        establish a date and will show that the theory was then nearly
        complete. It was not inserted in the Bulletin of the Academy,
        but an able physician, who gave an account of it in the Union
        Medicale of Paris, remarked that had it come from Germany it
        would have been received with acclamation. But there was not at
        that time any question about the medical doctrines of Pasteur
        and I did not then have to defend the microzymas against the
        denials of that savant; it was otherwise some years later. </p>
      <p>The foregoing exposition shows clearly the connection of the
        new facts of the microzymian theory with certain earlier facts
        of the same kind, ascending to Bichat and Macquer, who, in
        agreement with the science anterior to Lavoisier, recognised the
        spontaneous alterability of natural organic matters; and at
        length Spallanzane, who, to explain certain apparitions of
        organized beings ascribed to spontaneous generation, invoked the
        germs of the air. It has enabled me further to follow the
        connection of the successive discoveries of special facts which,
        since 1854, the commencement of these researches, have resulted
        in the discovery of the microzymas and to the demonstration that
        the blood is a flowing tissue. </p>
      <p>It is important to remark that the microzymian theory is in no
        way the product of a system or of a conception a priori, nor is
        it the consequence of a desire to demonstrate that the
        conception of Bichat and the cellular theory are conformable to
        nature. In fact, it has had for a point of departure the
        solution of a problem of pure chemistry and the necessity for
        discovering the role of the moulds in the inversion of a
        solution of cane sugar exposed to the air. Then, from induction
        to induction, applying unceasingly the method of Lavoisier, from
        the attentive study of the properties of the lowest organism I
        ascended to the highest summits of physiological chemistry and
        of pathology to discover wherein vital organization consists. </p>
      <p>But so fertile is a theory founded upon the nature of things,
        at the base whereof there is no gratuitous hypothesis, that
        after it had led me to discover the source of the zymases, the
        physiological theory of fermentations, the nature of what were
        called the germs of the air, it enabled me to understand what
        was true in the genial conceptions of Bichat, of Dumas, in the
        cellular pathology of Virchow and what profound truths there are
        in the aphorisms of the old physicians. </p>
      <p>The microzymian theory of the living organism is true because
        it agrees at the same time with these conceptions and with the
        three aphorisms which I have chosen as the epigraph to this
        first part of my preface. </p>
      <p>... nothing is but what ought to be. </p>
      <p>... nothing is created; nothing is lost. </p>
      <p>... nothing is the prey of death; all things are the prey of
        life.<br>

            AUTHOR'S PREFACE, Part 2 </b></font></p>
      <p>"The greatest disorder of the intellect is to believe things
        because one wishes that they were so." L. Pasteur </p>
      <p>To understand how man's intelligence, arrested at the same
        stage that it was in the days of Aristarchus, could come to
        proscribe the microzymian theory of the living organization as
        it had proscribed the theory of the movement of the earth, it is
        necessary to know something of the prejudices with which man's
        intelligence in these latter days has been imbued. </p>
      <p>The Lavoisierian theory of matter suggested to Bichat the idea
        that in organized beings, life is not connected merely with
        chemical compounds,ÿbut also with anatomical elements personally
        and autonomically living. This caused Fourcroy to say that
        plants are organized machines which formed the matters extracted
        from them, matters which Chevreul will call definite proximate
        principles, and which no instrument of art is able to imitate.
        Gerhardt in 1849 said of them that they are the work of the
        vital force. It was in vain that Bethelot, therein recalling
        Lavoisier, will think to prove that the proximate principles are
        chemical compounds such as those whose synthesis he effected;
        all the legitimate consequences of the conception of Bichat were
        disregarded, even the notion that the cellule is personally
        living, and it was maintained that: </p>
      <p>"The proximate principles of plants and animals are bodies,
        definite or not, generally very complex, gaseous, liquid, or
        solid, constituting organized substance by reciprocal solution,
        viz.: the humours, and by special combination, the anatomical
        elements." </p>
      <p>"Reciprocal solution" and "special combination"; vague
        expressions used to conceal a preconceived system, thanks to
        which it was only necessary to consider the proximate principles
        in a living organism as purely chemical matter. The autonomous
        nature of the anatomical elements in the tissues being thus set
        aside, it was declared that the protoplasm of the botanist Hugo
        Mohl was living, organized matter (although not morphologically
        determined, that is to say, not structured), whence the entire
        organism would proceed. It was thus that a liquid, in which all
        the proximate principles were supposed to be in a state of
        perfect solution, such as was called plasma in the blood, was
        called organized, living, and could die. </p>
      <p>This was going back beyond the hypothesis of organic molecules
        of Buffon to the old hypothesis of matter living by its nature
        and to that of an organization which would be only the most
        excellent modification of matter such as it was imagined to be
        in the epoch of phlogiston. </p>
      <p>That is where science stood in 1857; seeing in animal membranes
        and tissues only nitrogenised matter. Let us consider the
        consequences of this mode of view. </p>
      <p>In 1839, Fremy found that certain animal membranes could
        produce lacticÿacid with the sugar of milk, which Scheele had
        discovered in the whey of soured and clotted milk. Thereupon
        lactic fermentations were produced by treating solutions of the
        sugars with all sorts of animal membranes and tissues, with
        cream cheese or gluten, and at the same time with chalk used to
        saturate the lactic acid as it was produced. </p>
      <p>Berthelot resumed these experiments from another point of view,
        without neglecting the formation of lactic acid, but extending
        it from mannite sugar to allied substances, even to glycerine.
        The memoir wherein, in 1857, the author explained the results of
        his researches is entitled Sur la Fermentation Alcoholique, for
        it happened that in some cases the quantity of alcohol formed
        was greater than that of the lactic acid and other products
        which accompany them. But whatever name may be given to the
        phenomenon, lactic or alcoholic fermentation, that which
        resulted from the experiments of Berthelot was that: </p>
      <p>"The cause of fermentation seems to reside in its chemical
        nature, that is to say, in the composition and not in the form
        of the nitrogenous bodies (cream cheese, yolk of egg, muscle,
        pancreas, liver, kidney, spleen, testicle, bladder, small and
        large intestines, lung, brain, hairy skin, blood, dried fibrin,
        dried yeast, gluten, gelatine) fit to play the part of a
        ferment, and in the successive changes which their composition
        undergoes." </p>
      <p>On the whole, he was of opinion that: "The sugared body and the
        nitrogenised body are decomposed at the same time, exerting upon
        one another a reciprocal influence." </p>
      <p>In short, it was spontaneous fermentation of materials in
        presence (of one another). </p>
      <p>As to the chalk employed for calcic carbonate, it was supposed
        to be absolutely needed only in certain cases, for example for
        the fermentation of mannite; further, the calcic carbonate,
        besides maintaining the neutrality of the medium, had for its
        role: "to direct in a certain determined sense the decomposition
        of the nitrogenised body which provokes the fermentation." So
        far as an explanation of the phenomenon went, Berthelot seemed
        to relate it to the saccharification of fecula by diastase, the
        decomposition of amygdalin by synaptase, called fermentation, or
        even the etherification of alcohol by sulphuric acid; in short,
        to connect it, as did Mitscherlich and Berzelius, with an action
        called catalytic contact. </p>
      <p>Berthelot did not fail to have established by Robin, Montagne,
        and Dujardin, the disorganization of the tissues and the
        development of particular living beings (mucors and vibrios or
        bacteria). He does not explain their source, makes no mention of
        the molecular granulations, but, he asserts, "this development
        is in no way necessary to the success of my experiments." </p>
      <p>I have endeavoured to give an idea of the very important work
        of Berthelot because it constitutes the greatest effort in
        opposition to the opinion of Cagniard de Latour. But from the
        same experiments, entirely contrary conclusions ought to be
        drawn. </p>
      <p>In fact, the following year Pasteur, in a memoir upon lactic
        fermentation1 of sugar, under the conditions of Berthelot's
        experiment, placed himself on the side of Schwann and asserted
        that the development of special living beings was the sole cause
        of the fermentations pointed out, but without paying any more
        attention to the molecular granulations that Berthelot had done,
        he had the merit to distinguish among the particular living
        beings that which he named lactic yeast, and which he regarded
        as being to lactic fermentation what beer yeast is to the
        alcoholic. But of the development of these beings, especially of
        the lactic and alcoholic yeasts, what according to him, was the
        cause? He had the choice between two hypotheses; that of the
        germs of the air with Spallanzani and Schwann, and that of
        spontaneous generation; he chose the second, asserting that
        these beings were born spontaneously of the albuminoid matter of
        the nitrogenised matters. To prove this he made the two
        following experiments which are important to remember: </p>
      <p><i>1. Annales de chimie et de physique 3d S, Vol LII, p. 404</i></p>
      <p>"The lactic yeast is born spontaneously with as much facility
        as beer yeast wherever the conditions are favourable. </p>
      <p>Let there be, for example, first, water of sweetened yeast
        without addition, and, second, the same with the addition of
        chalk. </p>
      <p>In the clear solution of the first we have beer yeast and the
        alcoholic fermentation; in the solution to which chalk as been
        added it is lactic yeast and lactic fermentation which will be
        developed. The yeasts are born spontaneously of the albuminoid
        matter furnished by the soluble part of the yeast; the beer
        yeast because the water of the yeast is acid, the lactic yeast
        because the chalk makes the yeast neutral." </p>
      <p>We can say then that Pasteur and Berthelot have proposed, each
        in his own way, the spontaneous alteration of nitrogenised
        matter under the conditions specified by Macquer, but while this
        alteration resulted in the spontaneous generation of the
        ferments according to Pasteur, Berthelot did not express his
        views upon the origin of the living beings developed. </p>
      <p>As to the manner in which the lactic yeast acted, how did
        Pasteur understand it? Cagniard de Latour had said that the
        fermentation of the sugar was an effect of the vegetation of the
        yeast; Pasteur said of the lactic yeast that "its chemical
        action is correlative of its development and of its
        organization", which, though in other words, is the same thing
        and may be classed as an explanation by catalytic contact. </p>
      <p>I have insisted thus strongly upon this earlier work of Pasteur
        upon fermentations for two reasons: </p>
      <p>First, to firmly establish how vain had been the efforts of
        Schwann to establish the idea that there can be no spontaneous
        alteration of organic matters by fermentation without the
        presence of special living beings, and that in conformity with
        the hypothesis of the germs, these living beings were not the
        product of spontaneous generation. </p>
      <p>Secondly, to show how in 1858 Pasteur, having remained a
        sponteparist with regard to these living beings and as to beer
        yeast and lactic yeast, held that these organic matters were
        spontaneously alterable. We shall see how some years later
        Pasteur will discover all of a sudden that ferments are never
        born spontaneously, but always from these atmospheric germs
        which he had neglected; he will even discover that albuminoid
        matter is not necessary for it. He will next pretend to
        demonstrate that without these germs all organic matter, without
        exception, even an entire cadaver, will remain unchanged
        indefinitely. First it will be useful to know certain parts and
        certain conclusions of his memoir upon the alcoholic
        fermentation of cane sugar by beer yeast in the year 1860. 1</p>
      <p><i>1. Annales de chimie et de physique 3d S, Vol LVIII p323</i></p>
      <p>From this work it is first to be remembered that Pasteur in it
        again asserts the spontaneous generation of beer yeast and then
        the fact, absolutely new, that glycerine is among the products
        of fermentation, the same as in wine of vinous fermentation. He
        also discovered in it succinic acid, which had been long before
        discovered in it by Schmidt. </p>
      <p>With regard to the chemical action of the cellule of beer
        yeast, it is equally correlative with its development and
        organization. He was, in fact, so certain that the yeast took no
        other part in the phenomenon that he laboured hard to prove that
        all the products of fermentation came from the sugar, which
        would be a physiological heresy if fermentation is a phenomenon
        of nutrition which is accomplished within the ferment. </p>
      <p>It is thus that upon the interesting question of whether the
        cane sugarÿferments directly, or if it is first inverted (as was
        the opinion of Dubrunfaut in agreement with the remark of Dumas,
        who had shown that for the equation of fermentation the
        concurrence of water with the cane sugar is necessary), Pasteur
        pronounced for direct fermentation, asserting that the inversion
        was consecutive to the formation of succinic acid. </p>
      <p>Nevertheless he knew that I had demonstrated the inversion of
        the sugar by organized productions which are born in sugared
        water exposed to the air. None the less he wrote the following,
        which is typical: "I do not think that there is any special
        power in the globules of yeast to transform cane sugar into
        grape sugar."1 </p>
      <p><i>1. Loc. cit., p. 357. In relation to this, an observation is
          necessary. Some persons, no: well informed, ascribed to
          M.Berthelot the discovery of the property of beer-yeast to
          invert cane-sugar. That savant had nothing to do with it. The
          following is the truth thereon. In 1840, Mitscherlich
          discovered that the clear liquor obtained by leaving
          beer-yeast to drain upon a filter possesses the property of
          convening cane sugar into uncrystallizable sugar, whereas the
          globules of the ferment well washed with pure water are
          entirely deprived of this property. (Annual report of
          Berzelius, 3d year, p. 278, French Edition, 1843.) And
          Berzelius added: 'The formation of the uncryslallizable sugar
          is not due to the globules of the ferment, but to a soluble
          matter in the water with which they are mixed." Now, in 1860,
          M. Berthelot had simply confirmed the fact and isolated the
          soluble matter, whereof Berzelius spoke, but had not
          demonstrated that there was a special property of
          transformation of the cane sugar in the globules. That is what
          I demonstrated after having discovered that the moulds born in
          the sugared water without albuminoid maner, possess
          individually the inverting power, and that it was which was
          needed to prove that the soluble ferment was not a product of
          the change. See "Les Microzymas." pp. 45-47. and 'Memoir sur
          les Maderes albuminoides," p. 352, for the complete history of
          the zythozymas.</i></p>
      <p>He knew also that Berthelot had supposed that the reduction of
        the sugar into alcohol and carbonic acid was to be compared to
        the reduction of amygdaline by synaptase. He knew that Dumas had
        clearly stated that yeast, like an animal, could not be
        nourished only upon sugar; that for its normal life an
        appropriate albuminoid matter was needed. If he did nothing to
        elucidate these important questions it was because he was
        obsessed with the preconception that there is nothing in common
        between the organization and life of a cellule of yeast and that
        of an animal cellule. This was because he regarded it as certain
        that the ferments are living beings apart by destination, and
        that fermentations are individual phenomena. He asserted that a
        special ferment corresponds to each fermentation. </p>
      <p>This state of mind and a remark suggested to Pasteur an
        experiment which Dr. E. Roux, wonderstruck,! will entitle an
        "experiment a la Pasteur." </p>
      <p>This memorable experiment had for its object the
        multiplication, that is to say, the vegetation with
        reproduction, of beer yeast in a sugared medium without the
        addition of some appropriate albuminoid matter. The remark which
        made him attempt it was as follows: </p>
      <p>Pasteur had been greatly impressed by the results of my
        experiments regarding the inversion of cane sugar by the various
        productions which are developed in its aqueous solution, and
        especially by the act that the addition of certain
        non-ammoniacal mineral salts had the effect of increasing the
        harvest of these productions while causing them to vary. Now the
        nitrogen necessary for the synthesis of the albuminoid matters
        of these moulds could only have been that of the air left in the
        flasks in contact with these sweetened liquors. </p>
      <p>Pasteur repeated the experiments and was convinced not only
        that true ferments of many species were developed without the
        employment of albuminoid matters, but that these ferments had
        formed these matters by synthesis. Then he who had asserted that
        the ferments were spontaneously born from the albuminoid matters
        of the sugared media had to amend his former opinion. </p>
      <p>Assuredly, no more than I, could Pasteur have seen the beer
        yeast appear under the conditions in which the experiments had
        been reduced to their simplest expression, in order to make more
        strikingly plain the evidence that there could be no question
        there of spontaneous generation. </p>
      <p>He thought he would succeed better by adding to a solution of
        candied sugar the right tartrate of ammonia and for mineral
        salts the ashes of the yeast itself; he succeeded no better,
        then he added to the same mixture a lot of yeast, in the hope
        that the tartrate of ammonia and the sugar would form by
        copulation an albuminoid matter which would help the
        multiplication of the globules of yeast. There are two versions
        of the results of the experiments. </p>
      <p>One, that of Roux, more or less agreeing with or imitated from
        an earlier one of Pasteur, is the following: "Pasteur," he said,
        "had seen carbonic acid set free, the yeast augmented ... he
        observed that all the sugar had disappeared, transferred into
        alcohol, carbonic acid, etc." 1.</p>
      <p>The other, by Pasteur,2 is very different from that. There was
        set free, in fact, carbonic acid, but in microscopic globules;
        some sugar had disappeared, but out of ten grams, 5.5 grams had
        not fermented: there was some alcohol, but only a very small
        quantity, sensible but not sufficient to weigh, etc. What then
        had become of the sugar that had disappeared? It had become
        lactic acid, which had furnished "an abundant crystallisation of
        lactate of lime"; in short, the fermentation instead of being
        alcoholic had been lactic! </p>
      <p><i>1.Revue Rose Vol X fourth S., p834 (1898)</i><i><br>
        </i><i> 2. Annales de chemie et de physique 3d S., Vol.
          LVIII&nbsp; pp383 to 392 (1860) </i></p>
      <p>Now for the explanation of the facts according to the
        microzymian theory: </p>
      <p>Pasteur, having continued to neglect the hypothesis of germs,
        found that the situation of the beer yeast being
        extra-physiological, its globules had proliferated at the
        expense of the reserve of their content, so that the time soon
        arrived when these were exhausted, the new after the old, while
        infusoria and lactic yeast overspread the liquor. "The infusoria
        disappeared and the lactic yeast multiplied," said Pasteur.
        About a month later, the lactic yeast continuing to increase,
        the ferments were collected and weighed. </p>
      <p>Pasteur gave his results as being "of the most rigorous
        exactness." I, however, assert that under the conditions of his
        experiment, the quantity of yeast collected must have been less
        than that of the yeast sown. Now, reflecting upon what he
        thought was an increase of the yeast and this production of
        lactic yeast, he has given this experiment "as illuminating with
        a new day the phenomena of fermentation." </p>
      <p>This declaration is applicable to my experiments of the memoir
        of 1857, which are really demonstrative and which Pasteur has
        attempted to ascribe to himself while imitating after repeating
        them. In fact it was a plagiarism to the detriment of science. 1</p>
      <p>To complete the exposition of the state of the question in
        1860, here is an experiment of Berthelot in the sense of mine.
        The author made a solution of gelatine, of glucose and of
        bicarbonate of potash, saturated it with carbonic acid, filtered
        it while warm in a still which he filled completely and left to
        itself. At the end of a greater or less time (some weeks) gas
        was set free and a good deal of alcohol was formed. At the same
        time a slight, insoluble deposit was formed "composed of an
        enormous number of molecular granulations, much smaller than
        beer yeast and very different in appearance." 2.</p>

            the purpose of causing people to believe in the priority of
            Pasteur in this matter, has stated that the experiment was
            made in 1856, anterior to the publication of my memoir;
            while it really was of the 10th December, 1858, several
            months subsequent to the publication of the memoir, wherein
            M. Pasteur asserted that the ferments were the results of
            spontaneous generation from albuminoid matters ("prennent
            spontanement naissance des matieres albuminodies), posterior
            by a year to the deposit of my memoir with the Academy of
            Sciences, published by extracts in the first Compte Rendu of
            1858, and in extenso in the Annales de chimie et dephysique
            in September of the same year.&nbsp; It was in the same
            spirit, that before that time. M. E. Roux had the audacity
            to write that "the medical work of Pasteur began with the
            study of fermentations" (Agenda du chimiste for 1896); this
            was an absolute untruth, for seven years later M. Pasteur
            had not yet attained to an elementary understanding about
            them; M. Roux either did not go to the original documents or
            he was anxious to contribute to the legend which attributes
            to M. Pasteur the discovery of the facts of the microzymian
            theory. The only suitable expression is, that the legend is

      <p>Berthelot did not ascribe any role to these molecular
        granulations, and believing that he had performed the experiment
        "protected from contact with air", he asserted, as in 1857, that
        the presence of calcic carbonate (the chalk) or of any alkaline
        bicarbonate directs the decomposition of the nitrogenised body
        (in this instance, the gelatine) in a certain manner which sets
        up the fermentation by regulating the steps of the phenomena. In
        short, Berthelot had not yet distinguished between the
        calcareous rocks (the chalk) and pure calcic carbonate, exactly
        like Pasteur in this matter, and did not yet believe that
        atmospheric germs had anything to do with the appearance of the
        molecular granulations. In short, he naturally believed that the
        lactic yeast of Pasteur was also constituted of molecular
        granulations, and that there was nothing to show that it was
        organized and living; as was the opinion of Pasteur, who, in
        1858, stated that he had argued "on the hypothesis that the new
        yeast was organized and living." </p>
      <p>This, then, was the state of knowledge in 1860, and even much
        later. It was not known, although it already stood out from the
        facts of my memoir of 1857, and which the microzymian theory has
        since confirmed, that that which characterizes the fact of a
        living organization is not essentially, as the naturalists of
        the schools still believe, the establishment of the existence of
        some organ or structure, nor is it the presence of movement more
        or less spontaneous or voluntary in any living being whatever,
        or such as a microzyma, molecular granulation or lactic yeast,
        or such as a vibrionien. Rather, living organization is
        characterized by the property of producing and secreting
        zymases, each according to its nature or species; and the
        production of the chemico-physiological phenomena of
        transformation called fermentation, which are acts of nutrition,
        that is to say, of digestion, followed by absorption,
        assimilation, disassimilation, and so forth, and finally, the
        ability to reproduce itself if all conditions dependent upon
        nutrition are fulfilled. </p>
      <p>This is what Pasteur could not understand when he alleged in
        1860 that the fermentation of cane sugar by beer yeast was
        correlative to the multiplication of the yeast, which is as
        great a physiological heresy as to imagine that an animal could
        be nourished upon sugar alone. </p>
      <p>But soon after, Pasteur, who had not yet explicitly invoked the
        germs in explanation of the alterations of organic matters and
        the productionÿof the alterations of organic matters and the
        production of ferments, would explain by them what he had before
        explained by spontaneous generation; in short, he held my
        verification of the hypothesis to be so rigorously correct that
        in 1862 he published a memoir against spontaneous generation,
        wherein the alteration of all organic matters was explained as
        Schwann had done, by applying his method as improved by Claude
        Bernard. </p>
      <p>That was his second plagiarism. </p>
      <p>His experiments in the memoir of 1852 had been made with the
        organic substances treated, cooked, for the purpose of killing
        the germs which the air might have deposited upon them. In 1863
        he repeated them upon blood and flesh, not cooked, for the
        purpose of proving that they did not contain germs capable of
        becoming vibrios, and that, without atmospheric germs, they
        would be unalterable. Not being able to heat flesh in the same
        manner as blood, he applied my method, substituting alcohol in
        the place of creosote. </p>
      <p>That was a third plagiarism. But he could not see the
        vibrioniens which, in spite of the antiseptic agent, were
        developed in the depths of the flesh, and e concluded that
        neither the blood nor muscle became putrid because the germs of
        the air were absent from them. And he regarded as proven that
        there was nothing living in the blood or in the flesh, and that
        all animal matters, without the germs of the air, would remain
        indefinitely unchanged. </p>
      <p>While Pasteur thus experimented, I continued to develop the
        consequences of my memoir of 1857. I demonstrated especially
        that not only were the atmospheric germs unnecessary for vinous
        fermentation, but that they were injurious, and that the grape
        carried normally, upon itself, the cellules of the ferments of
        the lees; not only the germs but the fully developed ferment.
        This was in 1864. </p>
      <p>At last, in 1865, I announced to Dumas the fact of the
        existence in the milk, and in the chalk, of the agent which is
        the cause of the spontaneous alteration of the former and of
        that which enables the second to act as lactic ferment, agents
        to which in the following year I gave the name of microzymas. </p>
      <p>Pasteur, who had been named a member of the commission upon my
        memoir upon the ferment of the chalk, said not a word, and I
        continued with Estor the study of the microzymas of the higher
        organisms up to applications to pathology, as may be seen in the
        postface. This was in 1870. </p>
      <p>In 1872 Pasteur attempted his boldest plagiarism; he discovered
        all of a sudden, eight years after my discovery thereof (I will
        state elsewhereÿon what occasion), that the ferment of vinous
        fermentation exists naturally upon the grape. In this connection
        he discovered also that plant and animal matters contain
        normally the things which cause them to alter spontaneously;
        that their cellules, without the atmospheric germs, are
        ferments. In other words, he repudiated his experiments and
        conclusions of 1862. He announced that his "new discoveries"
        would mark an epoch in general physiology; and he asserted that
        he had thrown a great light upon the phenomena of fermentation
        and "had opened a new path to physiology and medical pathology."

        <p style="background: white"><i>[a. When a memoir is presented
            to the Academy which seems to be of more than usual
            importance, a commission is named composed of members
            reputed skilled in like studies to examine and report upon
            the memoir. It was of such a commission on the memoir of
            Bechamp upon the chalk ferments whereof M. Pasteur was
            appointed a member.—Trans.]</i></p>
      </div>
      <p>This was too much: up till that time I had treated the man with
        consideration; but now he must be properly exposed. </p>
      <p>First I, then Estor and I together, protested energetically.
        Our protests were inserted literally by Dumas and by Elie de
        Beaumont; the complete text can be read in the Comptes Rendus,
        Vol. LXXV, pp1284, 1519, 1523 and 1831. Pasteur replied by a
        subterfuge, to which we replied as follows: "We request the
        Academy to permit us to record that the observations inserted in
        the names of M. Bechamp and of ourselves remain unanswered.". </p>
      <p>Pasteur said no more, and abandoning "the new road" he
        pretended to have opened (a road which we showed we had not only
        opened but had sturdily traversed) he retraced his steps. Then,
        while since 1858 he had not disputed the meaning of any of the
        results, of any of the acts upon which the microzymian theory
        rests, results and facts which he knew to be exact and the
        discovery whereof he tried to ascribe to himself; then, I say,
        it was that he undertook in 1876 to explain them all by the
        atmospheric germs as he had "explained" them, in 1862, by
        spontaneous generation. </p>
      <p>He first evoked his experiment upon the blood in 1863, and,
        doubtless because Estor and I, after the discovery of the
        microzymas of the fibrin, had not thought it worth criticizing,
        he qualified it as famous(!), using it to deny even the
        existence of the microzymas. He then canvassed for approvers to
        maintain that uncooked milk, like the blood, is unalterable when
        preserved from contact with the natural air; that without
        atmospheric germs there would be neither fermentation nor
        disease, because there would be neither ferments nor microbes;
        for Pasteur, in spite of the inaccuracy of the etymology, had
        adopted this word with which to designate the micro-organisms. </p>
      <p>In short, Pasteur, who understood what he was about in this
        matter, ended by causing belief that things were as he wished
        they were, which as he himself has said, "is the greatest
        derangement of the mind." </p>
      <p>The strangest part of the business is that it was believed, and
        that the was able to make the Academies his accomplices1. </p>
      <p style="background: white"><i>1. The following is typical in
          this respect. M. Pasteur had treated M. Fremy shamefully,
          because he had maintained that cream cheese produced lactic
          fermentation of itself. I said to him: "But show then to the
          Academy the microzymas of the milk and of the cream, which are
          the lactic ferment of M. Pasteur and you will confound him."
          "Ah," said he, "I should never dare to pronounce the word
          microzyma at the Academy." To such an extent indeed had M.
          Pasteur cunningly manoeuvred!</i></p>
      <p>It is true that he had at the same time organized the
        conspiracy of silence around the works related to the
        microzymian theory - so thoroughly, that one day, after a
        discussion during which I had attacked the principles of the
        microbian doctrines and had defended the microzymian theory,
        Cornil maintained that the discoveries of Pasteur had been
        verified in every country and that I was alone against all the
        would; to which I replied: </p>
      <p>"It is not because everybody thinks so that it is true. I have
        demonstrated in an already old communication that the
        protoplasmic system, false in its principles, is false also in
        its consequences. It is so likewise with the microbian
        doctrines. For the dignity of science and of human reason it is
        time that they were abandoned!" </p>
      <p>The discussion did not rest there. I will narrate the rest,
        which is most instructive, in The History of the Microbian
        Doctrines, to show the sort of respect which Pasteur had for
        truth. </p>
      <p>It is true we have not been treated as was Galileo by the
        Inquisition, but Estor, painfully afflicted, wrote me this,
        which constitutes a grave witness against the spirit of these
        times: </p>
      <p>"We can publish letters from members of the Institute begging
        us in the name of our personal interest to proceed no further in
        the road opened (by us) ... but let them be convinced that
        energetic protestsa will be directed wherever one may hope to
        find associated science and honesty." </p>

      </p>
      <p align="center"><b>INTRODUCTORY AND HISTORICAL </b> </p>
      <p>The explanation of the fact of the coagulation of the blood,
        rightly regarded as spontaneous, has been sought for by
        physiologists, by physicians and by chemists, but without
        satisfactory result. The detailed history of the attempts at
        explanation would only demonstrate the uselessness of the
        preconceived hypotheses and systems on which they rest. Among
        all these hypotheses, only one deserves attention, precisely the
        one which the latest investigators have neglected to consider or
        to verify. The history of the conception of this hypothesis is
        of great interest. </p>
      <p>From time immemorial, it was known that shed blood soon becomes
        a concrete mass, red, of a consistency more or less soft and
        called a clot; the phenomenon was otherwise compared to the
        coagulation of a homogeneous liquid. </p>
      <p>It was not until the 18th century that Haller (in the
        supplement to the article "Blood," in the Encyclopaedia of
        Diderot), after correcting some errors of Leuwenhoeck concerning
        blood globules, asserted absolutely that they were essential
        elements of the blood, existing only in the red part, and, said
        he, "perhaps also in milk." </p>
      <p>But he recognised that "the figure of the blood globules is
        constant and that they are not merely a collection of fatty
        grains ... but circumscribed, bounded and solid." </p>
      <p>Haller also first placed the spontaneous coagulation of the
        blood on its true ground (tracing the theory back to Aristotle):
      </p>
      <p>"An element of the blood, generally so regarded by the
        ancients, especially by Aristotle, are the fibres which the
        scholiasts regarded as the foundation of the coagulable matter
        of the blood; these fibres have been seen in the clot-cake which
        the blood, left to itself, never fails to form, and which seems
        to be really a sort of network made of small membranes, which
        can be separated from the fluid part and can then be plainly
        seen." </p>
      <p>But Haller did not admit that the fibres were really an element
        of the blood. He said: </p>
      <p>"If the authors wish us to understand that these fibres are in
        the blood as are the globules, they are certainly in error." </p>
      <p>In support of his view he cited Borelli, the mathematician, who
        had been the first to refuse to admit "the fibres among the
        elements of the blood, as also Boerhave and other great men who
        have followed him," adding further: </p>
      <p>"If the authors wish to say that under certain circumstances
        fibres and flakes are born in the blood, he did not object
        thereto, "but observed that these fibres and flakes seemed to
        have their birth rather in the lymph than in the red particles
        of the blood. In short, according to Haller, the blood contained
        nothing solid and figured but the globules in a liquid called
        lymph, adding that he had recommended as a good way of rendering
        the globules visible the addition of certain salts to the blood
        which increased the fluidity and the colour; "nitre being of all
        salts that which gives the best colour to the blood." </p>
      <p>Haller,who derived the fibres of the clot from the lymph of the
        blood, was the precursor of the savants, who, like him, saw in
        the blood only globules in suspension in a liquid where
        everything else was supposed to be in a state of perfect
        solution. </p>
      <p>The circumstances of the formation of the clot, its shape
        depending on that of the vessel in which it was formed, its
        progressive contraction and expulsion of the yellow serosity,
        thence called the serum, were all observed with attentive
        curiosity. The blood having finished its contraction, the
        washings in water which dissolved its colouring matter furnished
        the white matter which was called the fibrous portion of the
        blood, and, after the reform of chemical nomenclature, fibrin.
        The fibrin was finally isolated from the blood by whipping,
        before it coagulated. The great German physiologist, J. Muller,
        believed with Haller: he wrote: </p>
      <p>"By liquor of the blood (liquor, lympha sanguinis) we mean the
        colourless liquid, such as exists before coagulation, in which
        the blood globules swim . . . it contains all that is really
        dissolved in the blood. At the moment of coagulation, the liquor
        separates itself from the fibrin which had before been
        dissolved"; and from his microscopic observations upon frog's
        blood, he thought that his researches "proved that besides the
        albumen, the fibrin was dissolved in the liquor of the blood." </p>
      <p>H.H. Schultze gave the name of plasma to the lymph of Haller,
        which Muller had called liquor saunguinis. </p>
      <p>The conclusion of J. Muller was the more circumspect, seeing
        that it was a refutation or contradiction of another mode of
        considering it, already published. W. Hewson had expressed two
        views, one of which had agreed with that of Muller; the other
        was original. According to the former, the fibrin exists in the
        blood in a state of solution; according to the other, it exists
        in it in suspension in a state of fine granulations; he further
        admitted that the globules did not contain fibrin. </p>
      <p>Milne-Edwards accepted the second opinion of Hew son,
        maintaining that the fibrin did not exist in solution in the
        blood, but in a finely divided state as a solid, under the form
        of fine granulations, which after the blood has been shed and
        left at rest, united together in the form of the fibres of the
        clot, or by whipping, to form fibrin. </p>
      <p>Dumas, who, with Prevost of Geneva, had first admitted the
        globular origin of the fibrin to explain coagulation, afterwards
        accepted, to a certain extent, the opinion of Milne-Edwards. </p>
      <p>It is important to explain the point of view of such a genius.
        He said: </p>
      <p>"None of the properties of fibrin give us the means of
        explaining the state in which it exists in the blood. It has not
        been possible to bring back the fibrin to this condition by any
        known process. In fact, the blood contains the fibrin, both
        liquid and spontaneously coagulable ... Everything leads to the
        belief that this fibrin of the blood is not in solution in it,
        but that it exists there in a finely divided state, which it
        maintains so long as the liquid is in motion, but which, in the
        liquid at rest, stops all of a sudden as a consequence of the
        disposition of the fibrin particles to unite in a fibrous and
        membranous network." </p>
      <p>Later he modified this view as follows: </p>
      <p>"The blood contains a quantity of spontaneously coagulable
        fibrin in suspension, or in a state so closely approaching
        solution, that it seems to be really dissolved in it; it is
        found there in a peculiar flowing state, analogous to that
        presented by starch mixed with water in the aqueous solution of
        starch." </p>
      <p>But neither of the views of Hewson, nor that of Milne- Edwards,
        nor that of the illustrious Dumas regarding the individual state
        of the fibrin in the blood, which, as will be seen, were the
        nearest to the truth, received much consideration, and were soon
        lost to view. Physiologists reverted more and more to the view
        of Haller adopted by J. Muller and by Schultze. The word
        "plasma" prevailed over lymph, and it was held that everything
        except the globules were in a state of complete solution in the
        blood. They came at last to believe that the blood did not
        contain fibrin even in a state of solution. </p>
      <p>In short, the fibrin which was called the "corps de delit" of
        the coagulation of the blood was imagined in turn to be the same
        substance as albumen; and it was further imagined that: </p>
      <p>- the albumen of the blood was none other than the fibrin
        combined with the alkali of the blood, only the part not so
        combined being coagulable; </p>
      <p>- that the plasma contained plasmine, which, when out of the
        vessels, transformed itself by spontaneous decomposition into
        concrete fibrin and into dissolved fibrin, called also
        metalbumen; </p>
      <p>- that the fibrin does not exist either in the blood or in the
        plasma; </p>
      <p>but that they contain, in solution, substances called
        fibrinogen and fibrinoplastin, respectively, which, outside of
        the vessels, under the influence of a ferment, produced the
        fibrin with an elimination of alkali, etc. </p>
      <p>Chemists agreeing with Thenard came to look upon fibrin as an
        isolated animal matter, that is to say, a "proximate principle,"
        according to the definition of Chevreul. Glenard, who paid a
        great deal of attention to the phenomenon of the coagulation of
        the blood and its causes, wrote upon the subject of fibrin, as
        follows: "Science has not yet been able to establish the
        constitution of fibrin, of the "corps de delit" of coagulation;
        it is not known whether it be derived from albumen, or should be
        regarded as one of its stages; and the formula of this substance
        varies with each chemist; it is not known whether it is
        superfluous (recrementitious) matter, or a product of excretion,
        a nutriment or an organic waste. </p>
      <p>It is, therefore, a legitimate conclusion that after a century
        of hypothesis on hypothesis, we have gotten back to the point
        where Haller had left the question. Having neglected the
        conception of Milne-Edwards and of Dumas, as well as some
        researches which seemed to be approximately a verification
        thereof, it is not a matter for surprise that scientists who
        understand neither the real nature of fibrin nor its origin, had
        recourse to occult causes for the explanation of the phenomenon
        of coagulation. </p>
      <p>The celebrated English Surgeon, Hunter, thought that: </p>
      <p>"blood coagulated by virtue of an impression, that is to say,
        that its fluidity being inopportune or no longer necessary in
        its state of rest after issuing from the vessels, it coagulates
        in reply to the indispensable customs of solidity"; also he said
        that "the blood possesses in itself the force, by virtue whereof
        it acts in conformity with the stimulus of necessity, a
        necessity which is derived from the position in which it finds
        itself." </p>
      <p>And Hunter wrote in the time of Haller. </p>
      <p>Long after, Henle, having said that the cause of the
        coagulation of the blood directly after circulation ceased was
        unknown, added: </p>
      <p>"Coagulation is often regarded as the last act of life, as the
        death of the blood." </p>
      <p>This point of view, which was not that of Henle, has been
        lately revived and fitted into the system signified by the word
        plasma. In short, the following propositions can be collected
        from a work full of interesting observations on the coagulation
        of the blood: </p>
      <p>"The blood is endowed with a life of its own." </p>
      <p>"Coagulation is a synonym for the death of the blood ." </p>
      <p>"By the fact of spontaneous coagulation, the plasma loses its
        chief property, that of living, and from the state of an
        organised humor becomes an inert aggregate of proximate
        principles." </p>
      <p>"Coagulation then is the disorganisation of the plasma." </p>
      <p>"It is the fact of this organisation which struggles for some
        minutes against the fatal influence upon the shed blood of
        contact with foreign bodies." </p>
      <p>Right here, before going further, will be the place to seek for
        the substance beneath the mask of words. </p>
      <p>It is true that the author of the above propositions did not,
        like Hunter, invoke "an impression" or `the indispensable
        customs of solidity" nor "the stimulus of necessity" to explain
        the phenomenon of the spontaneous coagulation of the blood, but
        has he escaped the shoals of &nbsp;"occult causes ?" </p>
      <p>It is true that blood as it issues from a living body is alive.
        But is it not an "explanation" by the occult causes to say that
        the blood coagulates because it dies? </p>
      <p>But if the chief property of the plasma, an organised humor, is
        to live, is not the struggle of its organisation against the
        fatal influence of contact, the loss of its life, also an
        "explanation" by occult causes? </p>
      <p>Also the plasma being an aqueous liquid, in which the materials
        composing it cannot be other than proximate principles, are by
        the hypothesis and by definition in a state of perfect solution,
        is it not an explanation by occult causes to say that the cause
        of its spontaneous coagulation is its disorganisation, etc.? </p>
      <p>And what is the value of explanations by occult causes? Here is
        the answer given to this question by Newton: "To say that each
        species of things is endowed with a specific occult quality, by
        means whereof it has a certain power of action, and can produce
        sensible effects, is to say nothing at all." </p>
      <p>Nevertheless, if in 1875 the author (M. Glenard) was reduced to
        the extremity of seeking an explanation of the phenomenon in
        considerations outside of anatomy, physiology and chemistry, it
        was because the then state of science did not offer anything
        more satisfactory. There are to be found in the transactions of
        the Academy of Sciences of the same year, attempts at
        explanation which compared the so called coagulation of milk to
        that of the blood. </p>
      <p>Still later, M. Frey, returning to the methods of Muller and of
        Haller, said: </p>
      <p>"Studied from the anatomical point of view the blood offers for
        our consideration a transparent colourless liquid, the plasma or
        liquor sanguinis, wherein float two kinds of cellular elements,
        the coloured cellules or red globules and the colourless
        cellules or lymphatic globules." </p>
      <p>And as regards the fibrin, he says: </p>
      <p>"It is not known under what form it exists in the liquids of
        the organism before coagulation, and it is generally supposed to
        be a derivative of albumen." </p>
      <p>That amounts to saying that the red globules and the leukocytes
        are the only figured elements of the blood, and that the plasma
        holds the materials composing it in perfect solution, as Muller
        thought he had demonstrated for his liquor sanguinis, these
        materials being reducible from the organic point of view to
        albumen. </p>
      <p>Further, Frey so thoroughly believed this that he said: </p>
      <p>"The rapid nutritive exchanges which are produced in the
        nutrient liquid of the organism hinder the formation of fibrin
        during life." </p>
      <p>All of which amounts to saying that at the moment of shedding
        the blood does not contain fibrin. </p>
      <p>And here it may be observed that neither Haller nor Muller had
        any prejudices on the subject of the innate nature of the lymph
        or liquor of the blood. On the other hand, when plasma is made a
        synonym for "liquor sanguinis" the question is prejudged, for
        the synonym plasma is attached to a particular conception of
        organisation and of life, in conformity to the system which
        asserts that: "Life is a special form of the activity of
        matter," a system which differs greatly from the doctrines of
        Bichat, according to which life is not attached directly to
        matter, but to anatomical elements limited as to their form and
        structure. On this I shall insist further in explaining
        anatomically and physiologically the spontaneous coagulation of
        the blood. </p>
      <p>But several years before GLenard and Frey wrote, Bechamp and
        Estor had demonstrated that the blood contains, besides the two
        species of globules, a third figured element, clearly determined
        in form and properties, by means whereof the phenomenon of
        coagulation could be explained without any recourse to occult
        causes. </p>
      <p>In his thesis Glenard referred to our researches in these
        words: </p>
      <p>"For reasons which we shall not fail to develop in a later
        work, we suppress a chapter having for title,`Theory of Bechamp
        and Estor on the Microzymas.' " </p>
      <p>I do not know whether Glenard has anywhere developed his
        reasons for suppressing the above entitled chapter from his
        thesis. For my part I had the great sorrow of not being able to
        continue and complete with Estor the work we had commenced
        together. A separation which occurred in 1876, and then the so
        premature death of Estor, deprived me of my eminent collaborator
        and devoted friend; I had to pursue alone the complete solution
        of the problem. My latest researches have been carried on in the
        laboratory which M. Friedel provided me with at the Sorbonne. </p>
      <p>The partial results of my researches have been described in
        notes which have appeared in various magazines; the last, in
        1895, was in the form of a communication to the Congress of the
        French Association for the Advancement of Science held at
        Bordeaux; but several portions, and that especially which is the
        crown and keystone of the work, remained unpublished until the
        appearance of the present work. </p>
      <p>The discovery of the third figured element of the blood was not
        made during the investigation of the phenomenon of the
        spontaneous coagulation of the blood; but Estor and I applied it
        according to the ideas then prevailing to the production of
        fibrin after phlebotomy, to explain the formation of the clot.
        When I resumed my study of fibrin from the point of view of
        blood-coagulation, I had already solved the problem of the
        coagulation of milk in a sense very different from received
        ideas, and this was long before the publication of the thesis of
        Glenard, who said: </p>
      <p>"Not only are we ignorant of the first cause of coagulation,
        but we do not even know its proximate cause; we do not know
        whether this change in the state of the blood is a physical or
        chemical phenomenon; whether it is a crystallisation or a
        precipitation." </p>
      <p>Unless I am much mistaken, that implies that the author doubted
        even what Haller, and, later, Muller, Hewson, Milne-Edwards and
        Dumas held as certain, viz., that the formation of the clot had
        the fibrin for its direct and near cause. As to the assertion
        that coagulation is a variation of the state of the blood, etc.;
        it proves that its author did not know either the anatomical or
        chemical constitution of the blood any more than that of milk. </p>
      <p>In our note of 1869, the microzymas of the blood were expressly
        mentioned as being the first cause of the production of fibrin
        and the proximate cause of coagulation. My new researches
        further demonstrated that the presence of the microzymas and
        that of the fibrin in the blood are correlative, the one
        presupposing the other; it was only necessary to explain this
        correlation to verify, while completing the conception of
        Milne-Edwards developed by Dumas. </p>
      <p>These new researches were allied to others, both older and
        newer, regarding the determination of the causes of the changes,
        reputed spontaneous, of organic matters, even of proximate
        principles in general, and specially of natural vegetable and
        animal matters, viz.: </p>
      <p>(1).The question of the origin of ferments and the
        physiological theory of fermentation. </p>
      <p>(2). The resolving in the negative the problem of the supposed
        spontaneous generation of ferments. </p>
      <p>(3). The origin of urea in the organism during the act of
        respiration. </p>
      <p>(4).&nbsp; The chemical constitution of albuminoid matters and
        the demonstration of the definite specificity of their chemical
        molecules. </p>
      <p>(5). The true theory of organisation according to the doctrine
        of Bichat.</p>
      <p>It is thus seen that the complete solution of the problem
        concerning the spontaneous coagulation of the blood necessitated
        the previous solution of several other problems very difficult
        of solution; they are given here nearly in their chronological
        order. </p>
      <p>1. The nature of fibrin, isolated from the clot, or obtained by
        whipping. </p>
      <p>2. The real specific individuality of the albuminoid proximate
        principles. </p>
      <p>3. The state of the fibrin in the blood at the moment of
        shedding. </p>
      <p>4. The real structure of the red globules of the blood. </p>
      <p>5. The real constitution of the blood at the moment of
        shedding. </p>
      <p>6. The real chemical and physiological meaning of the
        coagulation of shed blood.</p>
      <p>These will be the captions of the following chapters. </p>
      <p>After the developments which are to follow, it will be possible
        to understand that what is called the phenomenon of the
        spontaneous coagulation of blood is not at all a coagulation of
        the blood itself, but of that of a portion of its third
        anatomical element. </p>
      <p>It will then clearly appear, that that which is improperly
        called a coagulation is only the first phase of a much more
        complete alteration of the blood, involving the destruction of
        its blood globules and other changes, even that of its red
        colouring matter; and further, that this spontaneous alteration
        of the blood is but a special case of a very general phenomenon,
        that of the spontaneous alterability of all animal matter, solid
        or humoral, abstracted from an animal, whether living or dead;
        an alterability, physiologically spontaneous, necessary, drawing
        with it the destruction even of the cellular anatomical elements
        themselves, as the consequence of phenomena of fermentations of
        a special kind, whereof the microzymas of these matters are the
        principal agents.<br>

        <p style="background: white">Gay-Lussac and Thenard analyzed
          fibrin as they had analyzed albumen, caseine and gelatine.
          Thenard said that fibrin was an isolated animal matter;
          Chevreul said that it was an animal proximate principle and
          was greatly surprised, after he had discovered oxygenated
          water, to find that fibrin decomposed it and disengaged the
          oxygen, as did organic tissues; as, for example, the liver,
          etc. He even thought that fibrin was the only proximate
          principle of its kind endowed with this property.1</p>
        <p style="background: white">This fact in the history of fibrin
          is important; first, because it is the pivot on which turns
          the demonstration that this substance, reputed a proximate
          principle, is of the same order as the substance of the bodies
          which Chevreul called organic bodies; secondly, because,
          although neglected by physiologists and chemists, it enabled
          me to place beyond doubt the existence of a third anatomical
          element of the blood.</p>
        <p style="background: white">I did not set out with the idea of
          proving that fibrin is a substance of the same order as the
          organic tissues. Like everybody else, I regarded it as a
          proximate principle; I had even maintained its specificity
          against the chemists who contended that it was only coagulated
          albumen.2</p>
        <p style="background: white"> Preliminary steps to the discovery
          of the real nature of fibrin and of the third anatomical
          element of the blood. The ancients regarded it as a positive
          fact that all animal or vege­table matter was spontaneously

        <p style="background: white">fermenting. In the last century
          (i.e., the 18th) the chemist, Macquer, established the
          conditions for these changes; the presence of water, the
          contact of air and a certain amount of heat. Long after, when
          in 1837 Cagniard de la Tour regarded beer-yeast as being
          organized and living, and fermentation as an effect of
          vegetation, Schwann, generalizing the new conception,
          endeavoured to show that no organic matter was spontaneously
          alterable; that the alteration had for cause the presence of
          organized living things, microscopic cryptogams, vibrioniens;
          that is to say, ferments, the origin of which, reviving the
          old hypothesis of Spallanzanil, he ascribed to the germs of
          the air.</p>
        <p style="background: white">But, notwithstanding many important
          verifications, the opinion of Schwann did not prevail; the
          presence of living products in matter undergoing change was
          conceded, but while some maintained that the alteration
          preceded the appearance of the organized products, whatever
          might be their origin, others, admitting the theory of
          Cagniard, insisted that the living things, the ferments, were
          the fruit of spontaneous generation.</p>
        <p style="background: white">Schwann's point of view and the
          hypothesis of germs of the air were so completely abandoned
          that in 1854 it was admitted as a fact that even cane sugar in
          watery solution altered spontaneously at the ordinary
          temperature of the air, becoming what was called invert sugar,
          grape sugar. Was that true? The inversion of cane sugar, the
          result of a chemical reaction of reduction by hydration which
          was produced, as Biot had observed, under the influence of
          strong acids could it be effected by water only, at ordinary
          temperature with the aid of lime alone? I wanted to know what
          to believe, and I instituted experiments which commenced in
          1854 and were continued until 1857. Several consequences of
          the greatest importance resulted and, among others, the first
          experimental verification of the hypothesis of germs of the
          air which Schwann, following Spallanzanil had invoked against
          spontaneous generation. In short I demonstrated:</p>
        <p style="background: white">1st. That a watery solution of cane
          sugar remains unaltered indefinitely, at ordinary temperature,
          under the two following conditions: (A) Absolutely protected
          from access of air and (B) in contact with a limited volume of
          air, to which have been added certain salts or a suitable
          (small) quantity of creosote; as, for instance, one to two
          drops per 100 c.c.</p>
        <p style="background: white">2nd. That the same solution, pure,
          or with the addition of certain other salts in contact with
          the same volume of air, permitted the appearance of
          cryptogamic products, moulds, etc., at the same time that the
          inversion of the sugar was effected.</p>
        <p style="background: white">3rd. That the moulds are actually
          the agents, the ferments of the inversion, by secreting the
          necessary zymas or soluble ferment.</p>
        <p style="background: white">4th. That creosote, which hinders
          the birth of the moulds, etc., does not prevent developed
          moulds from effecting the inversion.</p>
        <p style="background: white">And as it is evident that the water
          and sugar of the solution cannot of themselves give birth to
          those cryptogamic productions which invert the cane sugar, nor
          to anything whatever organized and living, the conclusion is
          inevitable that these experiments verified the hypothesis of
          the existence of germs in the air.1</p>
        <p style="background: white"><i>1. Annales de Chimie at de
            physique, 3d S. op. Vol. L1V. p. 28. (1858.)</i></p>
        <p style="background: white">Cane sugar being a proximate
          principle, the experiment constituted also the first
          demonstration that organic matters exist which are unalterable
          under the conditions specified by Macquer.</p>
        <p style="background: white">To be applicable generally, it was
          necessary to prove that what was true for cane sugar was also
          true for any proximate principle, even for albumin, supposed
          to be so readily alterable that Colin believed it could
          spontaneously become an alcoholic ferment.1 But there are
          solutions of proximate principles, even of their mixtures,
          which contain some albuminoid substance like the solutions of
          cane sugar; these solutions, with a very small quantity of
          creosote added, are preserved, although in contact with a
          limited quantity of air, so that nothing organized makes its
          appearance, no ferment­ation, no putrefaction takes place. But
          if among the materials of the mixture there are some which are
          directly oxydizable by the oxygen of the air, creosote will
          not hinder the oxydation.</p>
        <p style="background: white">1. In 1858, M. Pasteur believed so
          little in the existence of germs of ferments in the air, that
          he asserted that the lactic ferment and beer-yeast were born
          spontaneously of the albuminoid matter of the fermentable
          media.</p>
        <p style="background: white">Let us bear in mind this capital
          fact which has been experimentally verified in every
          imaginable case: the solutions of isolated proximate
          principles, or mixtures of them, even albuminoid ones, first
          creosoted with a suitable (small) dose, exposed to the contact
          of a limited quantity of ordinary air, allow nothing living to
          appear, and remain unaltered except in cases where the mixture
          contains some directly oxydizable principle. In these kinds of
          experiments the creosote acts either by rendering the medium
          sterile for the germs or directly upon them, so as to prevent
          their development.</p>
        <p style="background: white">Organic matters reduced to
          proximate principles are unalterable under the conditions
          specified by Macquer, when the influence of the germs of the
          air is prevented by creosote; then they are so naturally. But
          Macquer did not take into account proximate principles, of
          which he had no idea. He really referred only to natural
          vegetable and animal matters, that which Thenard calls organic
          tissues and Chevreul organic bodies.</p>
        <p style="background: white">But among the animal matters on
          which Macquer experimented was milk, which he regarded as an
          animal emulsion, and held to be alterable of itself. Much
          later, Donne (an expert micrographist) and most chemists
          regarded milk as a solution of milk sugar, caseine and of
          mineral salts, holding an emulsion of butter in solution.
          Everybody then thought that milk was a pure mixture of
          proximate principles.a Such a mixture properly creosoted and
          in contact with a limited volume of air ought to remain
          unaltered indefinitely. But it was found to be otherwise.
          Cow's milk sufficiently creosoted at the time of milking,
          preserved from contact with air or in contact with only a
          limited amount of air, neither sours nor clots in the ordinary
          way. The creosote only delays the souring and the consecutive
          formation of the clot. But it was found that at the moment the
          milk became clotted, even when the phenomenon takes place in
          full contact with air, and with or without the addition of
          creosote, none of the cryptogamic productions could be found
          which Schwann's experiments led one to look for in it.</p>
        <p style="background: white"><i>[a Evan Landois in his
            Physiology (Eng.; trans, by Stirling, 1889), makes this
            mistake. He makes no reference to its ferment.— Trans.]</i></p>
        <p style="background: white">But the souring and the clot, I do
          not speak of the coagulation of the milk, is only the first
          phase in the phenomenon of alteration. The second phase, in
          spite of the addition of creosote, was characterized by the
          constant appearance of vibrios or of bacteria. Milk then does
          not act as would a simple mixture of proximate principles.</p>
        <p style="background: white">These experiments and observations,
          which date from before 1858, were not published until
          1873.1&nbsp; They had greatly surprised me. Milk then was not
          what it had been supposed to be. There exist in it organic
          matters alterable, without the aid of germs of the air, and
          Macquer was justified in declaring them to be spontaneously
          alterable. And since, notwithstanding the creosote the milk
          already altered, soured and</p>
        <p style="background: white"><i>&nbsp;1. C. R., Vol. LXXVI, p.
            654.</i></p>
      </div>
      <div class="Section7">
        <p style="background: white">clotted, permitted the appearance
          of vibrios in its substance, if these vibrios were not the
          products of spontaneous generation, to what did they owe their
          birth? It was experiments contemporary with those upon the
          calcareous rocks which will be studied in the last chapter of
          this work, as well as those which led to the discovery of the
          new category of living organized productions to which I have
          given the name of microzymas, because of their functions as
          ferments and of their extreme minuteness.1 It is then the
          microzymas of the milk itself which are the agents of its
          alteration and which subsequently becomes vibrios by
          evolution.</p>
        <p style="background: white"><i>1. C. R., Vol. LXIII, p. 451
            (1866).</i></p>
        <p style="background: white">The method which led to these
          results, as important as unexpected, the close relation
          between the geological ferments and the anatomical and
          physiological ferments of present living animals, and which at
          the same time answered in the negative the question of the
          spontaneous generation of organized ferments, is the same
          which has permitted the demonstration of the inherent
          unalterability of proximate principles, and to verify the old
          hypothesis of germs of the air which had been neglected.
          Thanks to it, it has been possible to explain anatomically and
          physiologically the phenomena of coagulation and the other
          spontaneous changes of the blood.</p>
        <p style="background: white">This method had its origin in
          experiments on the inversion of cane sugar, supposed to be
          spontaneous, and in those relating to the changes which
          occurred in milk, which made conspicuous the principle
          obtained by experiment, that creosote absolutely prevents the
          alteration of immediate principles by preventing the
          development of all living organized products, even in contact
          with a limited quantity of ordinary air, while the same doses
          under the same condi­tions did not prevent change in natural
          animal matters, tissues and humors, even permitting them to
          give birth to vibrios or to bacteria.</p>
        <p style="background: white">It is important to bear in mind
          that the new method (of experiment) enabled us to distinguish
          organic matters composed only of proximate principles, from
          natural vegetable and animal matters, that is to say, from
          organic bodies properly so-called; in short, to distinguish
          organic matter in the chemical meaning from that which, like
          milk,is organic matter in the anatomical and physiological
          meaning; the ferments which change the former, the organic
          matters in a chemical sense, that is to say, proximate
          principles, have for origin the germs of the air, while the
          ferments which change the second, that is to say, the natural
          organic matters, are the microzymas of their own substance,
          which are inherent in them as anatomical elements.</p>
        <p style="background: white">In fact, the phenomenon of the
          birth of the vibrios in the spontaneously altered milk, if
          indeed they were the result of the evolution of the microzymas
          of the milk, ought not to be an isolated fact, but a
          particular case of a general phenomenon, proper to all organic
          bodies, so that the fact of the birth of vibrioniens in an
          organic body, humor or tissue should be considered as evidence
          of the existence of microzymas in this tissue or this humor,
          even though the microscope has failed to reveal them.</p>
        <p style="background: white">Experiment has confirmed in every
          sense these consequences of the application of the new method
          of investigation to the study of the phenomenon of the
          spontaneous change of milk. The matter of all the tissues and
          humors, of all organic bodies, from the highest to the
          lowest—as, for instance, beer-yeast and the mother of
          vinegar—may give birth to vibrioniens in like conditions to
          those in which they are produced in the milk, or in which such
          conditions can be realized, if it be necessary to encourage
          otherwise the evolu­tion of their microzymas. And when the
          phenomenon of spontaneous alteration of such matter is
          recorded, the matter being protected from germs of the air,
          without the appearance of vibrioniens, it may be confidently
          affirmed that microzymas were present and were the agents of
          the change.</p>
        <p style="background: white">The following is the application of
          the method to fibrin, regarded as an organic body:</p>
        <p style="background: white"> Demonstration that fibrin is not a
          proximate principle, but a false membrane of microzymas. Birth
          of bacteria in the fibrin.</p>
        <p style="background: white">The fibrin is produced mechanically
          from the blood by whipping the latter; being regarded as an
          organic body, it ought like milk to contain microzymas capable
          of undergoing vibrionian evolution.</p>
        <p style="background: white">To demonstrate this, M. Estor and I
          employed a modification of the method which had been used to
          demonstrate the microzymas of the chalk and of muscle flesh.
          The modification consisted in preparing a starch of the fecula
          of potatoes, to boil it for a long time, to creosote it while
          boiling and to introduce into it the solid substance to be
          studied at the moment it was extracted from the creosoted
          water, into which it had been immersed to protect it from the
          influence of germs of the air. The experiment was as follows:
          Fibrin was obtained by whipping under the following
          conditions; at the moment of the venesection creosote was
          added to the blood, and at the same time it was whipped with a
          bundle of metallic wires which had just been washed in boiling
          creo­soted water; then the fibrin was washed in creosoted
          water. Into 100 grammes of creosoted starch 15 grammes of
          freshly prepared humid fibrin were introduced and the flask
          sealed and placed in the oven heated to from 30° to 40° C. (=
          86° —104° F.). The starch, exactly as happened with muscle
          tissue, became liquefied by degrees, and after a time the
          presence of bacteria in the mixture was evident; but it was
          observed that the liquifaction of the starch generally
          preceded the appearance of the bacteria.</p>
        <p style="background: white">The foregoing is a general view of
          the phenomena, but differences were observed in its
          manifestations, according to the species and age of the animal
          as well as the source of the blood. Generally the fibrin of
          young animals disintegrates in fluid starch, while the
          bacteria develop. The duration of the liquifaction of the
          starch is also variable.</p>
        <p style="background: white">It is known that boiled milk clots,
          which means that the microzymas are not killed at the
          temperature of boiling; on the other hand, to prevent the
          chalk from liquifying starch,a I was obliged to heat it
          (moist) to more than 200° C. (=392° F.). The microzymas of the
          fibrin resist up to 100° C. (= 212° F.). The fibrin was boiled
          for several minutes in distilled water before it was placed in
          the starch. In this case the liquifaction is still further
          delayed and even ceases to be produced if the boiling of the
          fibrin is too prolonged; but the bacteria appear none the
          less; and these bacteria present always the same morphological
          characters.</p>
        <p style="background: white"><i>[a For explanation of the action
            of the microzymas of the calcareous rocks see "Role de la
            craie dans les fermentations," Bull. Soc. Ch., Vol. VI, p.
            484 (1866); also "Les Microzymas," third conference; also
            post-chapter VIII of this work.—Trans.)</i></p>
        <p style="background: white">To complete the demonstration it
          should be added, and M. Estor was witness of the fact, that
          fibrin, exactly as was the case with the mother of vinegar (a
          sort of vegetable membrane of visible microzymas), and under
          like conditions can produce lactic and butyric fermentation, a
          fact which will be further considered hereafter.</p>
        <p style="background: white">Such was the experiment and its
          complement, whence it was concluded that fibrin, like milk,
          like flesh, like the tissue of liver, etc., contains
          microzymas, since, like them, it gives birth to bacteria
          without the aid of germs of the air.</p>
        <p style="background: white">Under the conditions of the
          experiment these micro­zymas could only have come from the
          blood. Efforts were then made to find them in the blood itself
          at the moment of the venesection. This was a delicate
          investigation and will be reverted to hereafter, as it is
          allied to the whole subject of this work.</p>
        <p style="background: white">Fibrin, whether obtained by
          whipping or by washing the clot (we will see presently wherein
          these two preparations differ), is not a proximate principle,
          but constitutes a membrane or fibre composed of microzymas. In
          short, it is not organic matter in the chemical meaning, but
          an organic body in the anatomical and physiological meaning.
          Nevertheless this demonstration that fibrin contains
          microzymas is indirect; and one might still contend that the
          bacteria has been born spontaneously, in the mixture of fibrin
          with starch. In any case it left unsettled the nature of the
          substance which, in the false membrane, is like an
          intermicrozymian gangue, as also the quantitative relation
          between the microzymas and this substance. It was therefore
          very desir­able to obtain these microzymas isolated, as Estor
          and I had isolated those of the liver.</p>
        <p style="background: white"> The fibrinous microzymas and their
          properties compared with those of the fibrin.</p>
        <p style="background: white">The question of the solubility of
          fibrin in dilute hydrochloric acid had been long discussed and
          it occurred to me that I might there find a means whereby the
          microzymas might be isolated, as they ought to be insoluble in
          it, as were those of the chalk. On going over the history of
          experiments on the fibrin, I found many experiments and
          observations relating to fibrin deserving attention which had
          been neglected.</p>
        <p style="background: white">Thenard had already described the
          action of dilute hydrochloric acid upon the fibrin of the
          blood and the formation of hydrochlorates of this substance,
          one of which, the gelatinous, was soluble in tepid water.1
          Long afterwards, Bouchardat called attention to the fact that
          Chevreul had</p>
        <p style="background: white"><i>1. Thenard, Traiee elementaire

      </div>
      <div class="Section12">
        <p style="background: white">demonstrated that fibrin always
          contained fat and he asked himself if even deprived of fatty
          bodies it would be a pure proximate principle? To demonstrate
          that that which had been generally admitted was not well
          founded, he made the following experiment:</p>
        <p style="background: white">He heated fresh, moist fibrin with
          ten times its weight of very dilute hydrochloric acid (1 to
          2000) and observed that it swelled up, and by a prolonged
          maceration was at last dissolved, but that there always
          remained manifest a portion of a product which was not
          attacked by an excess of this very dilute acid employed as a
          solvent. Bouchardat called the undissolved part epidermose,
          and albuminose that which was dissolved.1 It was from this
          experiment that Bouchardat justly concluded that the fibrin is
          decidedly not a proximate principle.</p>
        <p style="background: white"><i>1. C.R., Vol. XIV, p. 962
            (1842).</i></p>
        <p style="background: white">The part of the fibrin that
          Bouchardat regarded under the name of epidermose, as one of
          the two proximate principles constituting fibrin, was
          precisely the microzymas which I proposed to isolate. In
          consequence of the viscosity of the hydrochloric solution,
          essentially capable of change as Bouchardat had said, and of
          the slowness of filtration, he had not determined the quantity
          of the epidermose. By employing a less diluted hydrochloric
          acid (1 to 3 c.c. of fuming acid per 1000 c.c.) the viscosity
          was diminished, and on adding to it 2-3 drops of phenol per
          100 c.c. the suspected alteration was absolutely prevented,
          and the deposition of the insoluble part could be awaited.
          Even then it requires from ten to twelve days to filter a
          litre of the liquid. For quantitative experiments it must be
          left at rest and the deposit must not be turned out upon the
          filter until the filtration of the supernatant liquid is
          completed.</p>
        <p style="background: white">The grayish brown mass retained on
          the filter was resolved under the microscope into exceedingly
          fine molecular granulations, which are the microzymas, and
          some shapeless fragments proceeding doubtless from the blood
          globules destroyed during the preparation of the fibrin. To
          procure these molecular granulations as free as possible from
          foreign fragments the mass when removed from the filter is
          steeped in hydrochloric acid (1 in 1000), and the liquor,
          creosoted or carbolized, is passed through a fine linen mesh
          and left to deposit. The deposit is collected on a filter of
          very fine mesh, is successively washed with water to remove
          every trace of acid, and finally with ether, slightly
          alcoholized, to remove the fat. The matter when removed from
          the filter is then dried in a dry vacuum, is agglomerated, and
          brownish in color.</p>
        <p style="background: white">The moist fibrinous microzymas,
          completely drained, are composed (in hundredths) as follows:</p>

          100.000</p>
        <p style="background: white">Like all organized beings, they
          contain mineral matter and much fixed water. Their organic
          matter is chiefly albuminoid; in fact, dry, it dissolves in
          fuming hydrochloric acid, developing when hot a violet color;
          and if to the hydrochloric acid water is added a white
          precipitate of albuminoid matter is obtained.</p>
        <p style="background: white">The minuteness of these humid
          microzymas, swollen with water, is extreme. Under the
          microscope they appear to be spherical in form, animated with
          the brownian movements, the diameter whereof hardly attains
          0.0005 (half a thousandth of a millimeter).</p>
        <p style="background: white">Their quantity is very small. From
          some determinations, unavoidably somewhat uncertain, I
          estimated that the humid, drained fibrin of the general blood
          of an ox yields about one thousandth of its weight of
          microzymas dried at 100°. Taking this figure of 1/1000 as the
          best approximation, and considering that 1,000 grammes of
          drained fibrin contain 193 grammes of fibrin dried at 100°, it
          is evident that the weight of the dried microzymas is 1/193 of
          the dry fibrin; in short 100 parts of fibrin dried at 100°
          contain 0.518 parts of microzymas dried at the same
          temperature. This quantity appears to be very small, and one
          might think that in the blood it might be neglected, and that
          consequently the microzymas take no part in the phenomena
          studied. It is not so, for we shall see that they are
          anatomical elements and physiological agents of rare energy;
          and that if it was inter­esting to weigh them, it is still
          more so to count them.</p>
        <p style="background: white">Let us first show that in the
          fibrin they are at the same time that which liquifies starch
          and from which bacteria are derived, that which decomposes
          oxygenated water, and that which determines its apparent
          solution in dilute hydrochloric acid.</p>
        <p style="background: white"> 1. The fibrinous microzymas
          liquify starch and then become bacteria.</p>
        <p style="background: white">The microzymas of 60 grammes of
          fibrin obtained from the blood of an ox or of a dog, fresh,
          still humid, well washed so as to remove every trace of acid,
          are sufficient to liquify 50 grammes of potato starch at 45°
          to 50° C. (= 113°-122° F.). The liquifaction is completed in
          16 hours; if the reaction is prolonged, Fehling's reagent is
          reduced. Other things equal, the liquifaction is more rapid
          with the microzymas of the fibrin of a dog. Finally bacteria
          appear, while another fermentation begins and the liquid
          becomes acid.</p>
        <p style="background: white">To estimate the influence of the
          concentration of the acid in the extraction of the microzymas
          the fibrin in another operation was treated with hydrochloric
          acid, 3 to 1,000.&nbsp; The microzymas did not lose any of
          their activity.</p>
        <p style="background: white"> II.&nbsp;The microzymas of fibrin
          decompose oxygenated water.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="Section15">
        <p style="background: white">The humid microzymas, crude, or
          with the fat removed by ether, as well as such as have been
          dried in a dry vacuum, decompose oxygenated water, setting the
          oxygen free, but with much greater energy than the fibrin from
          which they had been obtained; showing therein an energy hardly
          less than bioxide of manganese. I ascertained that the
          microzymas of the fibrin of the blood of all the animals
          examined by me acted in like manner.</p>
        <p style="background: white">Later the theory of these facts
          will be explained, but to anticipate the objection regarding
          the germs of the air I call attention to the four facts
          following:</p>
        <p style="background: white">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fibrinous
          microzymas which have liquified starch are still able to
          decompose oxygenated water;</p>
        <p style="background: white">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fibrinous
          microzymas which have exhausted their decomposing action upon
          oxygenated water can no longer liquify starch and do not
          develop into bacteria.</p>
        <p style="background: white">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fibrinous
          microzymas which have been subjected to boiling at 100° C. (=
          212° F.) do not liquify starch and do not decompose oxygenated
          water;</p>
        <p style="background: white">4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          Fibrinous&nbsp;microzymas&nbsp;lose&nbsp;the&nbsp;property&nbsp;of
          decomposing oxygenated water with lapse of time.</p>
        <p style="background: white">But fibrinous microzymas washed in
          ether, so as to remove their fat, dried in vacuo and protected
          from contact with the air in a closed tube, preserve for a
          long time the property of decomposing oxygenated water, but
          lose by degrees their energy; after ten years they had lost it
          altogether, without having appreciably lost weight.</p>
        <p style="background: white">Here was another essential property
          of the microzymas which I formulated!</p>
        <p style="background: white"> III. Fibrin owes to its living
          microzymas the faculty of being dissolved in very dilute
          hydrochloric acid.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="Section16">
        <p style="background: white">Bouchardat, following Thenard,
          observed that before dissolving in dilute acid fibrin swelled
          up in a translucent, colorless gelatinous mass1 and that
          solution was effected only after prolonged maceration. The
          progress of solution is so slow that Liebig, for a long time,
          held that fibrin was insoluble in dilute hydrochloric acid;
          and we shall see that it was upon this remark that he founded
          the distinction between muscular fibrin (masculine or
          syntonine) and blood fibrin. Dumas, on the other hand,
          verified the fact of solubility and showed that at the
          temperature of 40° C. (= 104° F.) solution was more rapid.
          According to Dumas the phenomenon is a function of time and
          temperature. I shall prove that it is at the same time
          especially a function of the activity of the microzymas.</p>
        <p style="background: white">1.&nbsp; It was this gelatinous
          mass thai Thenard correctly regarded as a hydrochlorate of
          organic matter.</p>
        <p style="background: white">First let us remember that creosote
          or phenic acid delays the souring and coagulation of milk as
          well as the vibrionian evolution of its microzymas. Phenol
          similarly retards the supposed solution of fibrin in very
          dilute hydrochloric acid.&nbsp; The following will demonstrate
          the fact:</p>
        <p style="background: white">A mass of 600 grammes of fresh and
          humid fibrin of ox's blood is divided into four equal parts—A,
          B, C, D, each of 150 grammes, which are treated in flasks of
          like capacity in the following manner:}<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A, 2,000 c.c. of hydrochloric acid, 2 to
          1,000;<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B, the same volume of acid and 40 drops of
          phenol;<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C, the same volume of acid and 60 drops of
          phenol;<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D, 2,000 c.c. of boiling distilled water.
          The ebulition is maintained at 100° C. for two minutes. Left
          to cool and 4 c.c. of fuming hydrochloric acid are added, so
          that it was also diluted to 2 to 1,000.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="Section17">
        <p style="background: white">The four flasks were covered and
          placed in the same enclosure; temperature kept at 24° to 28°
          C. (= 75.2° to 82.4° F.).</p>
        <p style="background: white">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In A, B, C the
          fibrin swelled into a gelatinous mass. In d the fibrin
          remained a dull white, without becoming gelatinous.<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In A, the gelatinous mass was dissolved in
          three days.<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In B, the solution was effected in four
          days.<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In C, the solution was effected in six
          days.<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In D, the unswollen fibre remained a dull
          white; there was no change at the end of a fortnight, though
          with free access of air.</p>
        <p style="background: white">The phenomenon at the same
          temperature is then a function of time; it must also be so of
          the microzymas, since phenic acid retards it the more, the
          greater the dose, even as it delayed the coagulation of milk,
          and finally boiling for a sufficient time prevented it
          entirely, as it had prevented the fibrin and the fibrinous
          microzymas from liquifying starch and from decomposing
          oxygenated water. The function ascribed to the microzymas will
          be made still more clear when it is shown that that which is
          called the dissolving of fibrin is really the result of a
          reaction of a profound trans­formation undergone by that part
          of the fibrin which is in solution. The theory of the
          phenomenon will also be ex­plained presently; at present we
          will confine ourselves to saying that in the order of the
          ideas of these experiments the supposed solution in very
          dilute hydrochloric acid is, at bottom, only a mode of
          spontaneous alteration of the fibrin under special conditions.
          We have now to consider the normal method of its spontaneous
          alteration.</p>
        <p style="background: white"> IV. Fibrin changes spontaneously
          without undergoing fetid putrefaction.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="Section18">
        <p style="background: white">Gay-Lussac had observed that fresh
          fibrin, in an open flask, in contact with water which was
          renewed from time to time, putrefied and disappeared almost
          wholly, leaving only an insignificant insoluble residue. At
          the time this observation was made, it was believed that
          albuminoid proximate principles, as well as others, were
          spontaneously alterable. This was before the experiments of
          Schwann regarding the influence of the germs of the air. On
          the study of this change being again taken up to determine its
          products, among those which are dissolved, there was observed
          an albuminoid matter coagulable by heat, which was taken for
          albumin, also leucine, valeric acid, butyric acid,
          hydro-sulphate of ammonia, etc. In reality, in the experiment
          of Gay-Lussac, the alteration was a complex phenomenon, in
          which the ferments born of the germs of the air take part, and
          which are the agents of the fetid putrefaction. If the
          influence of these germs be annulled, the result is different.
          A mass of fresh fibrin, prepared with the usual care, was
          immediately im­mersed in distilled water (first carbolized by
          3-4 drops per 100 c.c.), so that it was covered with a bed of
          liquid. Under these conditions, after five to six weeks, at a
          temperature ranging from 15° to 25° C. (= 59°-77° F.) the
          fibrin had disappeared; in its place were a clear transparent
          liquid and a considerable precipitate. No odor except that of
          the carbolic acid; no vibrios either in the liquor or in the
          precipitate. The alteration then had taken place without any
          fetid putrefaction. What was its nature? Later in chapter 11
          the nature of these dissolved bodies will be compared with
          those of the change of fibrin in dilute hydrochloric acid. Let
          us see of what the precipitate consisted.</p>
        <p style="background: white"> The molecular granulations of the
          change without fetid putrefaction of the fibrin:</p>
        <p style="background: white">In the precipitate, which is
          greater than the precipitate of microzymas after the
          disappearance of the fibrin in dilute dydrochloric acid, the
          microscope shows us a very great number of very small
          spherical molecular granulations, much more bulky than the
          fibrinous microzymas, and some shapeless remains, probably of
          fibrin or of the envelopes of blood globules. To procure these
          molecular granulations pure the precipitate, which is thick,
          is steeped in water slightly carbolized, then passed through a
          close-meshed silk cloth, purified again by levigation,
          collected on a filter, to be there again washed with water and
          finally with ether slightly charged with alcohol to remove the
          fat, and then again with water.</p>
        <p style="background: white">In this condition the molecular
          granulations preserve their form; they decompose oxygenated
          water, liquify starch and again decompose oxygenated water
          after having effected this liquifaction; in short, they
          possess the properties of fibrin and of its microzymas, but
          they are neither fibrin nor its microzymas.</p>
        <p style="background: white">In fact, these molecular
          granulations, the insoluble remains of the disappeared fibrin,
          treated with hydrochloric acid (2 in 1,000), dissolve much
          more rapidly than the fibrin, leaving undissolved microzymas
          identical with, as slender as, and endowed with the same
          properties as, those of fresh fibrin.</p>
        <p style="background: white">This last observation is important.
          It is a consequence of the fact that fibrin, under the
          conditions of the experiment, alters spontaneously without
          fetid putrefaction, without vibrios, leaving a residuum of
          molecular granulations which contain microzymas identical with
          those obtained from fibrin treated with dilute hydrochloric
          acid. It is explicable only in one way. As milk, treated with
          a sufficient dose of phenic acid, becomes changed otherwise
          than milk not so treated or only slightly so, without the
          microzymas becom­ing vibrios, so the microzymas of the fibrin
          have trans­formed, in a certain way, the intermicrozymian
          substance which is in it, as gangue, without undergoing
          vibrionian evolution, but remaining enveloped as in an
          atmosphere of albuminoid matter insoluble in water, but easily
          soluble in very dilute hydrochloric acid, the microzymas being
          set free.</p>
      </div>
      <p style="background: white">The great importance of taking these
        molecular gran­ulations into consideration will be seen when
        studying in the third chapter the state of the fibrin in the
        blood. Meanwhile, the fact that the fibrin changes spontaneously
        in carbolized water, that is to say, without the aid of germs of
        the air, is a fresh proof that fibrin is not a proximate
        principle.</p>
      <p style="background: white">In the next chapter we shall see what
        is the nature of the albuminoid matters of the spontaneous
        alteration of fibrin in carbolized water, and compare it with
        that of the change which takes place under the influence of
        hydrochloric acid.</p>
      <p style="background: white">Meanwhile, such are the proofs, all
        agreeing, founded on the new method of investigation, to the
        effect that fibrin, like milk, the liver, etc., is neither a
        proximate principle nor a compound of such principles, but that
        like them it is an organic body, containing special microzymas;
        and further that these living microzymas are what, in the
        fibrin, liquify starch and can become vibrionien by evolution,
        decomposes oxygenated water; determines the change of this
        fibrin either in very dilute hydrochloric acid or in carbolized
        water.</p>
      <p style="background: white">To complete the history of the
        microzymas of the fibrin, we must try to discover by what
        mechanism they decompose oxygenated water and liquify starch,
        cither isolated or in fibrin; and how it is that they are the
        agents which determine the spontaneous alteration of fibrin,
        both in very dilute hydrochloric acid and in carbolized water.</p>
      <p style="background: white"> Theory of the decomposition of
        oxygenated water by fibrin and by the fibrinous microzymas.</p>
      <p style="background: white">I stated at the commencement of this
        chapter that Thenard, having discovered that organic tissues
        (for example, the liver) decompose oxygenated water, thought
        that fibrin decomposed it through being a proximate principle
        and was the only substance of this order that did so. But what
        is really the nature of the phenomenon of this decomposition?
        Thenard said that fibrin and organic tissues "decompose
        oxygenated water in the same manner as metals (platinum, for
        instance) without giving up any of their principles, without
        absorbing the smallest quantity of oxygen, without undergoing
        the least visible change." In short, that oxygenated water is
        decomposed by fibrin owing to what has since been called "action
        through presence," "catalytic action of contact," such as metals
        or the bioxide of manganese. Such was the state of science a few
        years ago and is so, perhaps, today. It was necessary for a more
        exact knowledge of the blood and of organization in general to
        fix exactly the meaning of this, both as to fact and as to
        principle; the more so that they were advanced by Thenard
        himself as a possible explanation of the phenomenon of
        fermentation, and were the point of departure of the hypothesis
        called actions of presence, of catalytic contact, which have
        been the cause that the true theory of fermentation has been so
        much misunderstood.</p>
      <p style="background: white">In reality, the decomposition of
        oxygenated water by fibrin, with disengagement of oxygen, is the
        result not of an action by presence merely, as with the bioxide
        of manganese, but of a chemical reaction, as is evident from the
        following experiments:</p>
      <p style="background: white">30 grammes of fibrin of fresh
        ox-blood, containing 3 gr. 79 of matter dried at 100° C., have
        successively decomposed three times 60 c.c. of oxygenated water
        at 10.5 volumes of oxygen. At the second and third addition, the
        disengagement became gradually slower, so that at the third,
        after twenty-four hours, no more gas was given off, although the
        oxygen­ated water was not all decomposed. Altogether 1,600 c.c.
        of oxygen were set free from 1,890 c.c., which the 180 c.c. of
        oxygenated water employed, contained. It is evident that if the
        fibrin had given up nothing, if there had not been some
        reaction, the successive liquors resulting from the action of
        the oxygenated water ought not to contain any organic matter.
        But these liquors on being evaporated left a combustible
        residue, whose weight,—deducting the ashes,— were 0.16 grammes
        dried at 100°---i.e., 0.533 for 100 of humid fibrin or 2.76 per
        cent, of fibrin dried at 100° C.</p>
      <p style="background: white">The fibrinous microzymas also yield
        up somewhat of their substance in decomposing oxygenated water.
        Six grammes of these microzymas, fresh, humid, containing 0.84
        gr. of matter dried at 100°, having exhausted their decomposing
        action, the evaporated liquors have left as resi­due, dried at
        100°, 0 gr. 06 of organic combustible matter, deducting the
        ashes; that is to say, 1 for 100 of humid matter-that is, 7.5
        per cent, of the weight of the dried microzymas.</p>
      <p style="background: white">Fibrin and its microzymas then do not
        decompose oxygenated water in the same manner as do platinum or
        the bioxide of manganese, since they both give up part of their
        substance which is found transformed in solution in the
        oxygenated water. If Thenard thought that fibrin gave up nothing
        it was because, on the one hand, he took into account only the
        disengaged oxygen, which seemed to him the whole of that which
        the oxygenated water could furnish; that which had been absorbed
        being very minute, and, on the other hand, that the fibrin
        seemed to him not to have undergone any change. But the change
        really has been great, since that which remains has no longer
        any action on oxygenated water, does not liquify starch and does
        not yield bacteria.</p>
      <p style="background: white">These remarks apply to the microzymas
        which are recovered, similar morphologically, to what they had
        been before being treated, but do not now liquify starch nor
        become bacteria by evolution.</p>
      <p style="background: white">It is then a fact, decomposition with
        oxygen set free from oxygenated water by fibrin or by its
        isolated microzymas, is correlative with a chemical reaction,
        with a change in the property of the substance which has
        exhausted its decomposing activity. And on comparing, in
        hundredths, the quantities (of the products of the reaction)
        which are dis­solved, of the fibrin and of the isolated
        microzymas, it is found that the latter furnish much more than
        the former. They furnish much more, even if we consider only the
        quantity of microzymas contained in the fibrin used, viz., o gr.
        0335 for 60 grammes of humid fibrin or 5 gr' .79 of that dried
        at 100° C. In fact, if the dried fibrin yields or contains 2.76,
        calculating that which its microzymas would give by comparison
        with what is given by the isolated microzymas, it is found to be
        4 per cent, instead of 7 per cent., which is that given by these
        latter. I do not lay much stress on this differ­ence because it
        may be due partly to the difficulties and uncertainties
        attendant upon the weighing. But none the less by means of these
        comparisons it is clear that the microzymas, whether isolated or
        not, give up more than does the fibrin, which tends to show that
        the intermicrozymian gangue of the fibrin does not exert any
        decomposing action upon oxygenated water, as will be presently
        directly demon­strated. Anyway it is evident that some substance
        belonging to the organization of the microzyma—probably a
        proximate principle—is yielded and transformed, and that it is
        not the entire microzyma which is the agent of the
        decompos­ition, since the greatest part of its mass remains,
        preserving its form. But what is this substance? Without being
        able to define it exactly we shall see that it is essentially
        albuminoid. Whatever it may be, it is important to know that it
        only effects the decomposition on certain conditions. For
        instance, oxygenated water, which contains a free acid, is not
        decom­posed either by fibrin or by the fibrinous microzymas,
        and, reciprocally, the fibrin dissolved by hydrochloric acid
        under the same conditions as the experiment of Bouchardat, in
        which the acid is very dilute, and containing the microzymas,
        decomposes it only when it is neutral. But albuminoid mat­ters
        combine with several acids; it is without doubt a
        hydro-chlorate, a sulphate, etc., of this substance, whatever it
        may be, which is not changed by oxygenated water, and
        oxygen­ated water which is not decomposed by it. In illustration
        of this the following very interesting case of the influence of
        a special acid is given.</p>
      <p style="background: white">Liebig observed that fibrin steeped
        in a very dilute solution of hydrocyanic acid did not decompose
        oxygenated water. The observation was true but incomplete, as
        the influence of this acid is only temporary. In fact, if the
        quantity of oxygenated water is sufficient, the liberation of
        oxygen recommences at the end of a time, the longer the greater
        the quantity of hydrocyanic acid. The decomposition recommences
        because the oxygenated water destroys the hydrocyanic acid by a
        phenomenon of oxydation without liberation of oxygen.1</p>
      <p style="background: white">1. C. R.. Vol. XCV, p. 926 (1887). I
        have since further studied this subject. Hydrocyanic acid and
        oxygenated water react upon each other; at first without the
        liberation of gas; an oxamide is formed which crystallizes; at
        the same time there is a liberation of heat, which increasing,
        the oxydation is accomplished with production of urea and
        liberation of oxygen. It is then solely because hydrocyanic acid
        and oxygenated water react first of all, that the microzymas of
        fibrin are protected, and not as has been supposed, because
        hydrocyanic acid acts as a poison upon these microzymas. The
        fact that after the destruction of the hydrocyanic acid, the
        fibrin again decomposes oxygenated water, proves that what
        happens is not a phenomenon of poisoning. This will be further
        treated hereafter.</p>
      <p style="background: white"> Theory of the liquifaction of fecula
        starch by fibrin and by the fibrinous microzymas.</p>
      <p style="background: white">Fibrin and its microzymas are
        insoluble in water; on the other hand, Payen demonstrated that
        fecula exists in a special condition of hydration and of
        swelling, in which it is similarly insoluble.</p>
      <p style="background: white">How then can these insoluble bodies
        act upon one another, the one, fecula, dissolving, while the
        other, the fib­rin or the microzyrnas, remain insoluble? The
        explanation is the same as before given of the inversion of cane
        sugar by moulds, born of the germs of the air in its aqueous
        solution, but which are insoluble, as are the microzymas.</p>
      <p style="background: white">I have proved directly that these
        moulds, born of other organized ferments, and other microzymas,
        produce in themselves and secrete soluble products of an
        albuminoid nature, which are of the same order as those called
        soluble ferments and which were confused in the same category
        with organized insoluble ferments. Having thus established the
        anatomical origin of soluble ferments, to mark the union of
        dependence between the product and the producer, I gave the name
        of zymas to what had been termed soluble ferment.</p>
      <p style="background: white">This established, as the microzymasa
        of sprouted barley produce diastase or hordeozymas, as the
        pancreas or its microzymas produce pancreazymas, which liquify
        and saccharify starch, so the fibrinous microzymas produce the
        zymas which effect its liquifaction.</p>
      <p style="background: white">[aFor the purpose of continuing "the
        conspiracy of silence" beneath which the marvellous discoveries
        of Bechamp have been obscured for so many years, this word and
        its congeners are never used in the writings of the chief
        conspirators, nor in those of the numerous leaders of the
        profession who have been duped by them.—Trans.]</p>
      <p style="background: white">And since every zymas is of the
        albuminoid order, as the fibrinous microzymas which have
        exhausted their decom­posing action upon oxygenated water do not
        liquify starch, we can say that the substance which in the
        fibrinous microzymas is given up and transformed by oxygenated
        water, is precisely this zymas, an albuminoid substance which
        liquifies the starch of fecula.</p>
      <p style="background: white"> Theory of the spontaneous alteration
        of fibrin, whether in very dilute hydrochloric acid or in
        carbolized water.</p>
      <p style="background: white">The two constitutive parts of fibrin
        are equally insoluble in water and in very dilute dydrochloric
        acid. As for the liquifaction of starch by them, the same
        question arises: how can these two insoluble bodies act upon one
        another, the one remaining insoluble, the microzymas; the other,
        the albuminoid matter, entering into solution? The answer is the
        same. In the same manner that fecula is made soluble and
        transformed by the zymas which the microzymas secrete, so the
        albuminoid matter is dissolved by this zymas while being
        transformed.</p>
      <p style="background: white">The explanation of the phenomenon is
        thus very simple. Only in the case in which very dilute
        hydrochloric acid inter­venes does the transforming chemical
        action of the zymas secreted by the microzymas act upon the
        insoluble combination, which the albuminoid matter makes, at
        first with the hydrochloric acid; while in the carbolized water
        it acts directly on the insoluble albuminoid matter as on the
        amylaceous matter of the starch. But the action of the zymas
        being exer­cised on the one hand on the hydrochloric combination
        of the albuminoid matter and on the other on this matter itself,
        it is not to be wondered at that the soluble products of the
        reaction differ in some respects, as will be explained in the
        second chapter.</p>
      <p style="background: white">It is now easy to understand why the
        previous coction of the fibrin hinders alike its solution in
        dilute hydrochloric acid and in carbolized water. It is because
        heat at 100° kills the microzymas as it destroys the activity of
        all zymases, and doubtless because the inter-microzymian
        albuminoid matter has undergone the special coagulation which
        hinders it from effecting the gelatinous combination with
        hydrochloric acid before spoken of.</p>
      <p style="background: white">To sum up: Fibrin is not a proximate
        principle. It decomposes oxygenated water correlatively to a
        change in the zymas produced by its microzymas, which zymas is
        the agent of the liquifaction of starch and of the changes
        under­gone by its albuminoid matter, whether in dilute
        hydrochloric acid or in carbolized water, conditions in which
        its micro­zymas do not undergo vibrionian evolution. In short,
        these microzymas, whether in the fibrin or isolated, are not the
        agents of the decomposition of the oxygenated water after the
        manner of ferments—that is to say, physiologically by a
        phenomenon of fermentation, but only as producers of the
        proximate principle which the oxygenated water changes as it
        changes hydrocyanic acid.</p>
      <p style="background: white">To complete a knowledge of fibrin and
        of its micro-zymas, I recall the facts that Estor and I, in our
        note, described an experiment from which we concluded that "in
        the presence of pure calcic carbonate and so long as the
        microzymas of the fibrin continued to evolve they behaved, as
        regards fibrin, at the same time as alcoholic ferment, and as
        acetic, lactic and butyric ferments.1 Among these experi­ments I
        will describe two, because they were conducted on a sufficiently
        large scale the better to establish results. The proportions of
        the materials employed were as follows:</p>
      <p style="background: white">Fecula of potatoes, 5 parts,
        transformed into starch in 85 per cent, of water; pure calcic
        carbonate, 1 part; fibrin fresh, moist, newly prepared, 0.13
        parts; temperature of the oven 35° to 40° C. (= 95°-104° F.).</p>
      <p style="background: white"><i>1. C. R., Vol. LIX.715-716.</i></p>
      <p style="background: white">The two experiments were started on
        the 22nd of May. The next day disengagement of gas commenced, a
        mixture of carbonic acid and of hydrogen. From the 8th day the
        gas was analyzed repeatedly, and was found to be composed as
        follows, in hundredths:</p>

          of May of the following year. The experiment then had lasted
          nearly a year. There was still some fecula not transformed.

        <p style="background: white">Thus, as in the classical lactic
          fermentations, the ferment which produced the lactic acid is
          that also which destroys this acid in the lactate of lime. It
          is only necessary to observe that the products formed by the
          microzymas of the fibrin differ greatly, both in proportion
          and in quality, from those of ordinary lactic fermentations,
          and especially from those by mother of vinegar. I shall, by
          and by, insist further on the fact that the bacteria of the
          microzymas which evolve in the first phase have gradually but
          completely disappeared in the second, so that at the end there
          only remained a few forms closely allied to the microzymas.
          But I insist here on the fact that for the two experiments 200
          grammes of fresh fibrin were employed containing at the start
          at most 0 gr. 2 of microzymas to effect the prodigious
          transformations of the fecula. The fibrinous microzymas are
          then figured ferments of rare energy.</p>

          albuminose of Bouchardat, which this savant believed existed
          in the supposed solution of fibrin in dilute hydrochloric
          acid, and to do this we must have a better knowledge of the

            fibrin, separated from its rnicrozymas, contains a mixture
            of albuminoid matters, soluble and insoluble in water.</b></p>
        <p style="background: white"><br>
          To solve the problem of the spontaneous coagulation of the
          blood, it is necessary to know not only the three anatomical
          elements of this humor, but also the composition of the medium
          in the midst whereof they live, because there are to be found
          united the conditions of their existence.</p>
        <p style="background: white">Let us admit—what will be
          proven—that, in accordance with the hypothesis of Hewson, of
          Milne Edwards and of Dumas, fibrin does not exist dissolved in
          the blood, and further that it is connected with what we have
          called fibrinous microzymas. We then recognize that the really
          liquid part of the blood contains all its components,
          including therein the albuminoids, in a state of perfect
          solution, as in the serum separated from the clot.</p>
        <p style="background: white">In 1815 it was supposed that the
          serum of the blood contained albumin as the only albuminoid
          matter, and this was not only identified with the white of an
          egg, but with the albumen of the serous fluid of the
          pericardium and of the ventricles of the brain, with chyle,
          and even with pathological serous fluids: such as that of
          dropsy, of blisters, etc.1 And these identifications were
          based solely upon a single character, coagulation.</p>
        <p style="background: white"><i>1. Thenard, Traite de chimie,
            Vol. III, p. 432 (1815).</i></p>
        <p style="background: white">Even to-day it is contended that
          two solutions contain the same albumin when they are
          coagulable at about the same temperature. But the phenomenon
          of coagulation has been so abused that it has become necessary
          to define it accurately.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="Section11">
        <p style="background: white"> The phenomenon of coagulation. At
          first the term coagulation was applied to the passage of the
          blood from a liquid to a solid state, in the same sense that
          one said of a liquid which solidified, of a vapor which
          condensed into a liquid,—that it coagulated. Fourcroy said of
          the white of egg, of the blood serum, etc., that they are
          concresciblea by the application of heat because they contain
          albumin. But in process of time, to the notion of
          coagulability, chemists added that of insolubility; to
          coagulate became for the albuminoids the correlative to
          becoming insoluble. For instance, when the white of egg forms
          into a solid mass in a hard boiled egg, it is said to have
          coagulated, to have become at once solidified and insoluble
          throughout; but as will be seen presently it is not so with
          the blood when that is said to be spontaneously coagulated.</p>
        <p style="background: white"><i>a. [Obsolete; from the Latin
            concrescere, to grow together, hence to solidify.—Trans.]</i></p>
        <p style="background: white">When coagulation was thus strictly
          defined in a chemical sense, the insolubility of the
          coagulated substance was only considered relatively to water
          as the solvent; solubility before coagulation was also
          relative to water. But we shall see that the idea should be
          completed by extending it to other solvents.</p>
        <p style="background: white">In the present state of science,
          for instance, the name fibrin is given not only to that which
          I have just studied, that of the blood, the general phlebotomy
          of adults, but also to that of the arterial or venous blood,
          without regard to the region of the vascular system from which
          it is taken, without distinction as to age; that of the chyle,
          that of the lymph or even of pathological serosities. And this
          fibrin was regarded as coagulated albumin without regard to
          the special action of fibrin upon oxygenated water, nor, as we
          shall see, of its own coagulability.</p>
        <p style="background: white">A rapid review of the history of
          albuminoid matters will enable us to understand how, in 1875,
          it came to be supposed that fibrin was only a stage in the
          transformation or alterations of albumin.</p>
        <p style="background: white">Under the influence of Gay-Lussac
          and of Thenard, of Mulder and of Dumas, chemists had admitted
          a certain number of nitrogenous matters of animal or vegetable
          origin as specific, not only when they were a little
          different, but even apparently identical in their centesimal
          elementary composition. These matters Dumas called "neutral
          nitrogenized matters of the organization," recalling thereby
          an old classification of Thenard. At last they were called
          albuminoids, comparing them to albumen, or white of egg, taken
          for a type, because of certain common properties and of some
          resemblances in composition. The notion of specificity
          prevailed up to 1840; after that, in spite of Berzelius, the
          singular idea of the substantial unity of these substances
          seemed to prevail. This is how it came about.</p>
        <p style="background: white">It will be remembered that
          Bouchardat gave the name of albuminose to the fibrinous matter
          dissolved by very dilute hydrochloric acid. The reason for the
          invention of this new word is a curious one. Biot had observed
          that the watery solution of the white of egg deviated the
          plane of polarization of polarized light to the left;
          Bouchardat, having found that the hydrochloric solution of
          fibrin also deviated the same plane of polarization to the
          left, concluded that "as the soluble principle of fibrin is
          identical with the dominant matter of the albumen of the egg,
          I propose for this pure substance the name of albuminose."
          Then dissolving in very dilute hydrochloric acid various other
          analogous substances and observing the same results in
          solutions thus obtained, he generalized as follows: "The
          fundamental principle found in the fibrin, in the albumen of
          egg, in the serum of blood, in the gluten of cereals, in
          casein, is always the same; it is albuminose, mixed or
          combined sometimes with earthy matters, phosphates of lime and
          of magnesia, sometimes with alkaline salts, sometimes with
          fatty matters, which mask their essential properties. If this
          ephemeral combination be destroyed by a really inappreciable
          proportion of acid, the albuminose solution is then found with
          identical properties, exactly similar chemical reactions,
          similar action on polar­ized light, always deviating to the
          left, the energy whereof, other things equal, is always
          proportioned to the weight of the substance dissolved.1</p>
        <p style="background: white">The above amounts to saying that
          the albumen of the white of egg, that of serum, the essential
          matter of gluten, of casein and of fibrin, are the same
          substance, possessing the same rotatory power.</p>
        <p style="background: white">We shall see how, even as to
          fibrin, to what extent the observation of Bouchardat was
          superficial and how he deceived himself in generalizing it. He
          deceived himself so strangely that he did not think for a
          moment that he had to do with hydrochloric combinations,
          believing that the quantity of hydrochloric acid of his
          solvent was inappreciable, etc. The chemists were equally
          careless. Ch. Gerhardt adopted Bouchardat's point of view and
          extended it.2 In Germany, especially, a legion of chemists
          maintained the substantial identity of these matters; P.
          Schutzenberger (a native of Holland, domiciled in France)
          adopted it. It was because they knew very little about the
          chemical constitution of albumen; so little that Ch. Gerhardt
          consigned albuminoid matters to a place below asphaltes and
          bitumens, and that in the general confusion M. Naquet thought
          that albuminoid substances did not belong to the domain of
          chemistry, but to that of physiology, as remains of organs.</p>
        <p style="background: white">But in 1856, while I was busied
          with the researches which resulted in the discovery of the
          microzymas, in a work on the source of urea in the organism,3

        <p style="background: white">as much from chemistry as from
          physiology, I had maintained the specific plurality of the
          albuminoids and demonstrated that these substances, animal and
          vegetable alike, produce urea by decomposition following a
          phenomenon of oxydation. In this work I succeeded in
          expressing the chemical constitution of albumin and of the
          albuminoids in general, regarded as proximate principles. I
          showed that their molecules were very complex, the most
          complex known, inasmuch as formed of numerous non-complex
          molecules of the fatty and aromatic series, among which were
          amide derivatives, amides and sulphides, in the number whereof
          urea was never wanting, so that if the ureides of M. Grimaux
          had been known I should have said that albumin is a very
          complex ureide. In this work I laid the foundation for the
          future researches which led me to the discovery that the
          albuminoid matters, even those regarded as proximate
          principles, are either mixtures, like the albumin of white of
          egg, or organized things, like fibrin and vitellin. The
          researches whereby I demonstrated analytically that there are
          a great number of natural albumins and albuminoids, reducible
          to rigorously defined proximate principles, were made the
          subject of examination by a commission of the Academy of
          Sciences and of a report by J. B. Dumas.1 It was in the memoir
          which is the subject of this report that is to be found the
          demonstration of the specific plurality of albuminoid matters,
          and that the doctrine of their substantial unity is an error.2</p>

        <p style="background: white">Among other things, I demonstrated
          that the classical albumin, the white of egg of the fowl, the
          type to which had been referred all those matters which were
          identified under the name of albumin, was a mixture of three
          proximate principles, irreducible to one another; all three
          albuminoids, all three soluble and deviating the plane of
          polarization of light to the left, whereof two are coagulable
          by heat, the third not coagulable, a veritable zymas. And J.
          Bechamp, having analyzed, by the same method, the whites of
          eggs of a number of oviparous animals, birds and reptiles,
          discovered among them other albumens, other zymases, different
          from those of the egg of the fowl; so different and differing
          among themselves that he was able to specify the species of a
          bird by the albumens of its egg.1</p>
        <p style="background: white">But prejudice and partisanship are
          so tenacious that nothing was of any avail. Notwithstanding
          the report of Dumas, long afterwards, a learned physiologist
          held that fibrin was a proximate principle. He did so in
          reliance on the opinion of M. Duclaux proclaiming "the extreme
          mutability of albuminoid matters and the folly of the chemical
          specifications established in this category of organic
          substances,2 and again maintained that fibrin was a proximate
          principle.</p>

            solution of fluoride of sodium and concluded that it was a
            digestion.</i></p>
        <p style="background: white">It is upon such opinions that rests
          the assurance that fibrin is a stage in the mutations of
          albumin and that the albumen of milk is a consequence of
          another change in caseine, as asserted by M. Duclaux. All this
          is inaccurate and one may even say absolutely untrue, for pure
          albuminoid matters are fixed and are as rigorously definable
          and specific as any other proximate principle.</p>
        <p style="background: white">Independently of the ignorance
          which prevailed touching the chemical constitution of the
          albuminoids, that which most constributed to perpetuate these
          prejudices was that so little was known concerning the faculty
          of the albuminoids to form combinations with bases or acids,
          that even Dumas had held them to be neutral nitrogenous
          matters. It is true that Bouchardat said that they form
          combinations with the alkalies and alkaline earths, but said
          that such combinations were only ephemeral. Thenard admitted
          the formation of combinations with hydrochloric and sulphuric
          acids, but no one paid any further attention thereto.
          Lieberkuhn regarded the albumen of the white of egg as an
          albuminate of soda, but said also that casein was an
          albuminate of potash, etc. These kinds of combinations, under
          the hypothesis of substantial unity, served to explain the
          differences presented by these matters, compared with one
          another, as being soluble or insoluble. What is certain is
          that, at least in the animal organism, albuminoid matters are
          always combined with an alkali or an alkaline earth, and that
          further these combinations are complicated by the presence of
          phosphatic earths, which they dissolve. And as if to augment
          the confusion and force of prejudice, natural coagulations
          were admitted, at the same time that the insolubility of
          fibrin was sought to be explained by its combinations with
          phosphates, it was called coagulated albumen; as to the
          soluble albuminoids, to differentiate them they invoked
          coagulation by heat; those which coagulated at the same
          temperature were regarded as identical; casein was said to be
          insoluble by heat, but coagulable by acids, thus confounding a
          purely chemical phenomenon of precipitation with a physical
          phenomenon, etc.</p>
        <p style="background: white">My researches have solidly
          established that from those natural materials which always
          constitute mixtures there can be separated by means of
          analysis the albuminoids, proximate principles, which when
          isolated have an acid reaction and which unite with bases in
          as definite proportions as any acid, so that casein produces
          with sodium a neutral caseinate, and a bicaseinate, which
          reddens litmus paper. I also demonstrated that these
          substances can form combinations with hydrochloric acid and
          with acetic acid in several proportions. From these various
          combinations the albuminoid matter, whether soluble or
          insoluble, can always be isolated with its own proper
          characters and always with the same rotatory power.</p>
        <p style="background: white">But the natural albuminoid matters,
          even when reduced to proximate principles isolated from bases
          and other min­eral matters with which they had been combined
          or mixed, are neither crystallizable, volatile nor fusible;
          they possess then none of the so-called constant characters
          employed by chemists to ascertain at once their purity and
          identity. How then can one make sure that the substance
          isolated by analysis is always identical with itself? I
          employed for a constant the rotatory powers employed for a
          like purpose by Bouchardat with the substances studied by him.</p>
        <p style="background: white">The following table gives the
          rotatory powers of the chief albuminoid matters on which
          Bouchardat experimented and disposes of the theory of the
          substantial unity of these matters. In the table the numbers
          are relative to the perceptible tint according to Biot.</p>

        <p style="background: white">We will now see how it is with a
          solution of blood-fibrin in very dilute hydrochloric acid.</p>
        <p style="background: white"> The hydrochloric solution of
          fibrin, separated from its rnicrozymas, contains a mixture of
          albuminoid matters, soluble and insoluble in water.</p>
        <p style="background: white">The limpid solution, which has been
          obtained with or without the addition of phenol, has a decided
          acid reaction and is without action on oxygenated water. The
          solution is really one of hydrochloric combinations with
          albuminoid matters, whereof the greater part is insoluble in
          water. In fact, on the addition of dilute ammonia so that the
          liquor becomes faintly alkaline, an abundant dead white
          flocculent precipitate is produced which, collected on a
          filter, well washed with distilled water, with alcohol and
          with ether and rapidly dried in a dry vacuum, forms a
          pulverulent matter. Was this the whole of the fibrin less its
          microzymas? If yes, the fibrin is purely and simply dissolved;
          if no, the solution was the result of a reaction. The
          alternative will be determined by dosing.</p>
        <p style="background: white">A manipulation of 60 grammes of
          fresh fibrin contain­ing 11.5 gr. of matter dried at 100° C.
          furnished 7.6 gr. of this insoluble matter likewise dried at
          100° C.; that is to say, only 66 per cent, of the weight of
          dry fibrin; consequently 34 per cent, of matter remained in
          solution. If the reaction is continued longer before
          separating the microzymas, the quant­ity of matter
          precipitated by the ammonia diminishes, while the dissolved
          portion increases.</p>
        <p style="background: white">The substance insoluble in
          water—the ammonia precipitates—possesses further the same
          elementary composition as fibrin, but it differs from the
          intermicrozymian substance in that it is directly soluble in
          very dilute hydro­chloric acid, as well as in acetic acid and
          in ammonia. I have given it the name of fibrinine.</p>
        <p style="background: white">Further the fibrinine does not
          decompose oxygenated water and does not liquify fecula starch.</p>
        <p style="background: white">Among the substances which ammonia
          does not precipitate is one which alcohol precipitates after
          the separation of the fibrinine. This precipitate is a
          mixture; one portion is soluble in water, the other does not
          redissolve. I have given the name fibrimine. to that portion
          which is finally soluble in water.</p>
        <p style="background: white">But the part precipitated by
          alcohol is the smaller part of the material which ammonia does
          not precipitate; the rest is to be likened, more or less, to
          the extractives such as are found in gastric digestion; I add
          that the fibrimine possesses the property of liquifying starch
          and I regret that I did not think of examining, if it, or some
          of the compounds accompanying it, has the property of
          decomposing oxygenated water.</p>
        <p style="background: white">However that may be, the following
          are the rotatory powers of the hydrochloric solution of the
          fibrin as a whole, and of that of fibrinine and fibrimine:</p>
        <p style="background: white">Fibrin (from blood of sheep, cow
          and pig):<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rolatory power of the hydrochloric solution<br>

        <p style="background: white">A comparison of these various and
          different rotatory powers, answering to other properties, not
          less different, of the bodies which possess them, is
          sufficient to show that the identification made by Bouchardat,
          which led him to believe that there was a substantial unity
          among albuminoids, had no foundation in the real nature of
          things. Nevertheless it</p>
        <p style="background: white">1. To complete these comparisons,
          in order to give a better understanding of the specific
          individuality of each albuminoid proximate principle, and to
          show still further the value of the new method of research,
          which, for shortness, I call the antiseptic method. I add the
          following:</p>
        <p style="background: white"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We know that
          fibrin, left to itself in carbolated water, changes while
          dissolving in great pan without becoming fetid, leaving a
          residue of microzymas enveloped in an insoluble albuminoid
          atmosphere.</p>
        <p style="background: white"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In short, while
          spontaneously transforming, fibrin produces some dissolved
          materials and others insoluble. The whole of the dissolved
          portion, albuminoid and others not volatile, had a rotatory
          power (a)j = — 29" to — 30°, which proves that under these
          conditions the soluble products are different from those
          formed in the change on contact with very dilute hydrochloric
          acid. Among the dissolved products, which together have the
          above rotatory power, were one zymas and several soluble
          albuminoids, coagulable by heat and having different rotatory
          powers in fact, from those of the hydrochloric solution. (See
          "Memoire sur les matieres albuminoides," p. 425.)</p>
        <p style="background: white"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More than ten
          years after the report of Dumas and the publication of my
          memoir on the albuminoid matters, a learned physiologist, M.
          A. Dastre, reached the same conclusions on applying the
          antiseptic method to the study of fibrin. He also found, in
          effect, that crude fibrin, "in contact with antiseptic salt
          solutions (fluoride and chloride of sodium) does not merely
          dissolve, but is transformed" into divers substances called
          globulines, proteoses, propeptones, peptones, as it does under
          the influence of gastric juice. M. Dastre found also that the
          spontaneous transformation of fibrin resulted in the formation
          of soluble and insoluble products without taking the
          microzymas into account, and further he generalized by
          applying the same method to crude albuminoid substances
          without other distinction, and without specifying the nature
          of the products formed, for the words, peptone, pro peptone,
          proteose, globulines, are applied to a great number of very
          different things.&nbsp; To show this assertion is well
          founded, here are the rotatory powers of the soluble products
          of digestion of some albuminoid matters digested by the
          gastric juice of the dog:</p>

        <p style="background: white">was upon this identification and on
          the results of elementary analyses made upon mixtures and not
          on real proximate principles that was based the opinion which
          regarded fibrin as coagulated albumen, or as a stage in
          suppoitious changes in the albumen of the white of egg.
          Although it has been ascertained that this albumen, coagulated
          or not, did not set free oxygenated water, this enormous
          difference was disre­garded, as well as the fact which
          followed the incomplete solution of fibrin in dilute
          hydrochloric acid, whence it was obvious that fibrin was not a
          proximate principle. Hence it is not surprising that for a
          long time muscle fibrin was confounded with that of blood, and
          that even today the fibrin obtained from blood is regarded as
          being the same whatever be the animal or part of the vascular
          systems from which it comes, even also the fibrins of chyle,
          of the lymph and of pathological serosities. Denis (of
          Commercy) had already established that certain fibrins of the
          veinous blood were dissolvable in a solution of saltpetre
          (nitrate of potash), while others, including fibrins of
          arterial blood, did not dissolve in it. Estor and I
          demonstrated that the fibrin of the blood of very young
          kittens liquified and disappeared in the starch which it had
          liquified, while its microzymas evolved. On the other hand, I
          found that the fibrin of ox-blood did not dissolve under the
          conditions specified by Bouchardat and that it was necessary
          to employ hydrochloric acid at 3 in the 1,000. In another
          experiment the fibrin of the blood of a young chicken, treated
          with hydrochloric acid at a 2 per thousand strength, did not
          swell up even after remaining a long time in the oven, and at
          the end of several days the acid had dissolved very little of
          it, and the liquid hardly produced a precipitate with ammonia.
          Nevertheless this fibrin decomposed oxygenated water before
          treatment; it decomposed it also after treatment when the acid
          had been eliminated by washing with water. In short, to become
          convinced that fibrin is a much more variable anatomical
          substance than a definite chemical principle, always the same,
          it suffices to recall the former observations of Marchal de
          Calvi, of Magendie, and of Claude Bernard, as well as those of
          J. Birot and of J. Bechamp.1</p>
        <p style="background: white">We must then erase the fibrins from
          the list of proximate principles to see in them only what they
          really are, viz., microzymian false membranes. The
          intermicrozymian matter of these fibrins is not probably the
          same in all. However that may be, it is certain that the
          intermicrozymian matter of the fibrin common to ox or
          sheep-blood is not coagulated albumin; that it is naturally
          insoluble, dissolving in very dilute hydrochloric acid only by
          a sort of auto-digestion, whereof the microzymas it contains
          furnish the zymas; and not only is it not a coagulated
          albumen, but it is itself coagulable by heat, becoming
          incapable of combining with dilute hydrochloric acid and of
          being thereafter dissolved in it.</p>
        <p style="background: white">In his report to the Academy of
          Sciences, Dumas did not fail to call the attention of savants
          to the fact that fibrin owes its property of decomposing
          oxygenated2 water to that part of it which is insoluble in
          dilute hydrochloric acid. Shortly after M.M. Paul Bert and P.
          Regnard published a memoir upon the action of oxygenated water
          upon organic matters3 which raised delicate historical
          questions of chemistry and of physiology and of facts which I
          could not leave unanswered. This reply was the subject of
          several notes.4</p>

        <p style="background: white">In the communication of M.M. Bert
          and Regnard, I had chiefly addressed myself to the following
          assertion: "That the blood even defibrinated, acted with great
          intensity upon oxygenated water and that this action seemed to
          be entirely contained in the serum; and, further, that ossein
          very clearly decomposes oxygenated water."</p>
        <p style="background: white">I observed also that the authors
          did not distinguish between the expressions organic matters
          and animal matters, — which was in conformity with the then
          state of science. But I knew what to believe regarding the
          fact that defibrinated blood decomposes oxygenated water, and
          I had ascertained the nature of the proximate principle which
          was its agent.</p>
        <p style="background: white">And first let us place it beyond
          doubt that it is not the serum which, in defibrinated blood,
          has the greatest share in this decomposition. The fresh yellow
          (citron) serum which is first pressed out of the clot
          unquestionably sets free oxygen from the oxygenated water,
          which might be due to morsels of fibrin remaining in
          suspension. But the same serum, filtered several times upon a
          filter lined with sulphate of baryta, acts less and less on
          the oxygenated water without ever entirely ceasing to do so,
          which is very simply explained by the secre­tion in the serum
          of the substance which, in the fibrinous microzymas, effects
          the decomposition; but when the serum begins to be red-colored
          the action upon oxygenated water is incomparably more
          energetic, the explanation whereof is as follows:</p>
        <p style="background: white">The defibrinated blood contains the
          red globules, and these contain the red colouring matter and
          their own (special) microzymas. Much has been written upon
          this red matter which has come to be called haemoglobin; and
          which was at first regarded as being a mixture of a colourless
          albuminoid matter called globulin and of haematosin. Much has
          also been written upon haemoglobin up to maintaining that it
          is not an albuminoid because it contains iron. It was J. B.
          Dumas who first studied and analyzed the colouring matter of
          the blood of the globules as an albuminoid prox­imate
          principle.</p>
        <p style="background: white">I have studied haemoglobin from the
          same point of view as other albuminoid matters; admitting that
          it exists combined with potash in the globules, I have
          succeeded in combining it with the oxide of lead under the
          form of haemoglobinate. But the haemoglobinate of lead,
          decomposed by carbonic acid, furnishes soluble haemoglobin in
          the state of an absolute proximate principle.1</p>
        <p style="background: white"> <i>1. C. R., Vol. LXXVIII, p. 850
            (1874), and "Memoire sur les Matieres albuminoides," p. 270.</i></p>
        <p style="background: white">The solution of pure haemoglobin is
          coagulable by heat and by alcohol; in both cases the coagulum
          is absolutely insoluble in water. The solution is of deep red
          colour, the alcoholic coagulum is of a brick red.</p>
        <p style="background: white">Haemoglobin, even coagulated by
          alcohol, decomposes in the presence of alcoholized ether under
          the influence of sulphuric acid, into haematosin and a
          colourless albuminoid matter.</p>
        <p style="background: white">That settled, and to be more
          precise, and apropos to the communication of M.M. Bert and
          Regnard, let us recall that Thenard admitted that the action
          of organic tissues upon oxygenated water was of the same order
          as that of platinum, etc. Nevertheless he did not fail to
          point out that while these metals decompose, "an infinite
          quantity" of oxygenated water, it was not the same with
          organic tissues and fibrin, some decomposing it for a long
          time, others for a shorter period. In the first category he
          placed the tissues of the lung, the liver, the spleen and
          fibrin newly extracted from the blood; in the second he placed
          the nails, the fibro-cartilage of the ribs, the tendons, the
          skin; these, said he, "soon entirely ceased to act," and, much
          surprised, Thenard sought an explanation of these differences.
          We will presently learn that the differences pointed out by
          the illustrious observer related to the different nature of
          the microzymas of the tissues; meanwhile I will only remark
          that the most active organic tissues belong to the vascular
          and respiratory systems. But we must not forget that Thenard
          took fibrin for an isolated animal matter: that is to say, for
          a proximate principle of animal origin. Let us then compare
          the action of fibrin in this respect with that of haemoglobin,
          which is really an animal proximate principle.</p>
        <p style="background: white">To illustrate: let us take,
          suppose, 30 grammes of fresh moist fibrin and 6 grammes of
          fresh moist fibrinous microzymas. In 48 hours the 30 grammes
          of fibrin will have set free 1,600 c.c. of oxygen from 180
          c.c. of water oxygenated to 10.5 volumes of oxygen; that is,
          53 c.c. of oxygen per gramme of fresh fibrin or 0.193 grammes
          dried at 100° C.</p>
        <p style="background: white">In 48 hours the 6 grammes of
          fibrinous microzymas will have set free 1,000 c.c. of oxygen
          from 160 c.c. of water oxygenated to 10 volumes of
          oxygen—i.e., 166 c.c. of oxygen per gramme of moist microzymas
          or 0.139 gramme, dried at 100° C.</p>
        <p style="background: white">Now as to the haemoglobin. In one
          experiment 10 c.c. of a solution of this substance, pure,
          containing 0.338 gramme of matter and 4 c.c. of water
          oxygenated to 10.5 volumes of oxygen, have set free 30 c.c. of
          gas in three-quarters of an hour and 34 c.c. in 24 hours.
          Further, so soon as the disengagement of the gas began, the
          liquor became cloudy, flocculent matter appeared, and at the
          end the discoloration was complete.&nbsp; The phenomenon then
          is correlative to a change and an oxydation, for the
          oxygenated water being able to set free 42 c.c. of oxygen had
          only set free 34 c.c. of it; the oxygenated water is, further,
          almost completely decomposed. If one operates with
          sufficiently large quantities, heat is developed and carbonic
          acid mixed with oxygen is set free. As to the other products
          of the discoloration by oxydation of the haemoglobin they are
          numerous, and among them albuminoid and other soluble
          products, and at the same time an insoluble body containing
          iron. Haemoglobin then, a proximate principle, decomposes
          oxygenated water, becoming changed in so doing like fibrin and
          its microzymas; but at equal weights the haemoglobin produces
          a less disengage­ment of oxygen than they.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="Section26">
        <p style="background: white">That which distinguishes the mode
          of being of the haemoglobin is that, even coagulated by
          alcohol and then heated to 120° C. (= 248° F.), it becomes
          still more discolored in decomposing oxygenated water, with
          disengagement of oxygen, while cooked fibrin becomes inactive.</p>
        <p style="background: white">But the haemoglobin is reducible
          into a colorless albuminoid matter and into haematosin; that
          is to say, into two new proximate principles. Now the
          colorless albuminoid matter of the decomposition, freed from
          the sulphuric acid with which it had been combined, does not
          set free oxygen from oxygenated water. On the other hand, the
          insol­uble haematosin and oxygenated water react strongly with
          disengagement of heat and of oxygen mixed with carbonic acid,
          while, absorbing a part of the oxygen, it is entirely
          transformed into soluble products. And, what is quite the
          opposite of what happens with fibrin and fibrinous microzymas,
          free sulphuric acid does not hamper the reaction.</p>
        <p style="background: white">It is evident from this that the
          haemoglobin owes lo the ferruginous molecule of haematosin,
          which is one of the constituent molecules of its own molecule,
          the property of decomposing oxygenated water, destroying
          itself by oxydation. And it is thus that certain proximate
          principles of the fibrinous microzymas and the oxygenated
          water react, causing the decomposition of the latter with
          disengagement of oxygen.</p>
        <p style="background: white">Here then are many undisputed
          proximate principles which act upon oxygenated water after the
          manner of the organic tissues of which Thenard spoke, and
          after the manner of fibrin, which is also an organic tissue.
          It is useful to con­nect the facts relative to haemoglobin and
          to haematosin with the reciprocal reaction of hydrocyanic acid
          and of oxy­genated water, to show that they are not isolated
          facts. Further, Thenard himself observed that oxygenated water
          of a certain concentration reacted upon cane sugar with
          disengagement of oxygen and of carbonic acid.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="Section27">
        <p style="background: white">In defibrinated blood it is then
          especially the haemoglobin of the blood globules which is the
          agent of the decomposition of oxygenated water; and if the
          lemon-colored serum (always with little intensity) effects
          this decomposition, it is because it contains, besides its own
          albumen, some proximate principle, zymas or other, which is
          able to do so. In fact the albumen of the serum,1 isolated and
          pure, is as little endowed with this property as is the white
          of egg and the colorless albuminoid of the decomposition of
          haemoglobin.</p>
        <p style="background: white">1. The albumen of the serum! The
          rotatory power of this albumen has been given in the foregoing
          table to distinguish it from the albuminoid substances which
          Bouchardat confounded under the name of albuminose. But its
          specification is of such importance for an exact knowledge of
          the blood that it would have deserved a chapter to itself; but
          thanks to what has preceded, this note will suffice.</p>
        <p style="background: white"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, let us
          remember that Denis (of Commercy) (1856) supposed that the
          plasmin of the plasma was decomposed, after the bleeding, into
          concrete fibrin and dissolved fibrin, afterwards called
          metalbumen. So that, according to this hypothesis, the serum
          expelled from the clot contains this metalbumen and its own
          albumin. Denis thought he could verify this hypothesis by
          isolating from the serum its dissolved fibrin or metalbumen in
          the following manner: when crystals of a sulphate of magnesia
          are added to the serum, this salt is dissolved in it and a
          time comes when the serum is so saturated that no more will be
          dissolved and a precipitate is formed. It was the substance of
          this precipitate, insoluble in a saturated solution of
          sulphate of magnesia—but soluble in water, which was supposed
          to be dissolved fibrin. One was the more sure of it because,
          under like conditions, the white of egg. common albumen, gives
          no precipitate to sulphate of magnesia. Such is the experiment
          which led to the admission of plasmine and its reduction which
          would give the metalbumen, which would dissolve in the serum
          with its own albumen, supposed to be identical with the
          albumen of while of eggs. But all this is erroneous. The blood
          contains no plasmin and the serum does not contain two
          albumins whereof one is metalbumen. In fact, Prof. J. Bechamp,
          in his "Albumines normales et pathologiques," p. 31, has
          demonstrated that the precipitate determined in the serum by
          sulphate of magnesia is the same substance, endowed with the
          same rotatory power as the serum albumin mentioned in
          table.&nbsp; Further he proved that certain albumins of the
          bird's egg are likewise precipitated by sulphate of magnesia,
          as is known to be the case with certain pathological
          serosities, but the precipitates thus obtained from these
          pathological albuminous liquids, also called metalbumens,
          possess different rotatory powers than those of the albumens
          of the white of egg of certain birds. Whence the conclusion
          that there is not a melalbumine or dissolved fibrine.</p>
        <p style="background: white">Further the specification does not
          rest only on the difference in rotatory powers, but on all the
          properties taken together. But a direct proof will be given
          that there is nothing in the blood resembling the hypothetical
          body called plasmin.</p>
        <p style="background: white">This colorless albuminoid of the
          decomposition of the haemoglobin, by its rotatory power and
          other properties, is absolutely distinct from the albumins and
          albuminoids of the table. But the blood globules also contain
          microzymas which decompose oxygenated water. In studying them
          it is necessary to observe that the organic tissues which
          effect this decomposition owe this power especially to their
          anatomical elements or to some proximate principle secreted by
          them. In other words, the property of decomposing oxygenated
          water does not characterize organic tissues or bodies, as was
          believed by Thenard.</p>
        <p style="background: white">The study of these albuminoids in
          general, and especially of those of the blood, proves that the
          nitrogenous inter-microzymian matter of the fibrin is of a
          special nature, distinct from all other albuminoid matters,
          especially from the type of albumin which may be coagulated,
          and that is itself coagulable by heat, becoming thus
          absolutely insoluble in very dilute hydrochloric acid.1</p>
        <p style="background: white">But the special study of the fibrin
          which revealed the fibrinous microzymas has taught us nothing
          with regard tcr the condition of the fibrin in the blood
          during life, that is to say nothing regarding the relation of
          the intermicrozymian matter and the microzymas. This will be
          the subject of the next chapter.</p>
        <p style="background: white">1. To explain how fibrin in its
          spontaneous changes may give birth to a great number of
          products of decomposition, it is well to add the following to
          what I have said as to the complexity of the albuminoid
          molecule.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is commonly said that albuminoid
          matter is a nitrogenous quaternary. But I have shown that
          casein, absolutely free from mineral matter, contains
          phosphorus, and as the casein in the mammary gland results
          from the transformation of the albuminoid matters of the
          blood, it follows that these are also phosphoretted; casein
          also contains sulphur, which was known, but was supposed to be
          accidental. Then the haemoglobin contained iron. An albuminoid
          molecule may thus contain besides carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen
          and oxygen, phosphorus, iron and sulphur, seven elements
          instead of four.</p>
        <p style="background: white"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have observed
          that in the albuminoid matters of the vitellin microzymas the
          sulphur does not produce sulphuric acid precipitable by baryta
          when they are oxydized by the hypermanganate of potash; in
          this it resembles Taurine, "Memoire sur les matieres
          albuminoides," p. 389.<br>

        <p style="background: white">The experiments which demonstrated
          that the fibrin was of a complete whole, formed of a special
          albuminoid matter belonging to it, and of microzymas, and not
          a proximate principle, did not solve the problem raised by
          Dumas, to ascertain under what condition a substance thus
          composed existed in the blood; neither did it solve the
          problem whether such a substance pre-existed in it or if it
          was the result of a chemical transformation accomplished after
          the bleeding.</p>
        <p style="background: white">It was not at the first attempt
          that I solved the problem in the sense of the conclusion
          arrived at in this chapter, viz., that the blood really
          contains the fibrin in the state of microzymian molecular
          granulations where the microzyma and the special albuminoid
          matter are closely associated in a very special anatomical
          element. The solution of this problem could only be completely
          given after the collection of the observations which have been
          summarized in the first two chapters and of those which I have
          yet to describe.</p>
        <p style="background: white">Let us recall first what, in 1869,
          was the state of opinion regarding, first, the pre-existence
          of the fibrin in the blood; second, its production in the
          blood after it had issued from the vessels. On the
          pre-existence of the fibrin there were two opinions: According
          to one, which was that of Hewson, of Milne-Edwards and of
          Dumas, fibrin existed in the blood in a condition of extreme
          division, in fine molecules, which, after the bleeding, became
          consolidated to constitute the ordinary fibrin. According to
          the other, which was also that of Hewson, and, in a certain
          manner, of Dumas, it existed in it in a state of solution or
          of quasi-solution. Cl. Bernard1 allied himself thereto by
          admitting that the blood contained an albumino-fibrinous
          liquid which could only remain liquid in the economy, taking
          on the form of fibrin after the bleeding. </p>
      </div>
      <p style="background: white"><i>1. CL Bernard, "Liquides dc
          1'organisme." Vol. I, p. 152 (1859).</i></p>
      <p style="background: white">These opinions, nevertheless, have
        had no part in the solution of the problem. They had been so
        thoroughly lost to sight that Estor and I had tacitly ranged
        ourselves among those who did not admit the pre-existence of the
        fibrin. Indeed, after having proved the presence of the
        microzymas of the blood in the fibrin, by the fact of their
        vibrionian evolution in the substance itself, we said, in
        February, 1869:</p>
      <p style="background: white">"That which is called the fibrin of
        the blood is a false membrane formed by the microzymas of the
        blood, associ­ated with a substance which they secrete in an
        acid state from the albuminoid elements of this liquid."1</p>
      <p style="background: white">It was because we had sought for and
        discovered the molecular granulations in the blood, before
        proving that there were microzymas in the fibrin, that we
        compared them to the microzymas of the liver, finding them
        smaller and more transparent than the latter.2</p>
      <p style="background: white">Nevertheless, these microzymas in the
        blood had not been isolated by us. The consideration that, in
        the liver, the microzymas are especially included in the hepatic
        cellules led us to seek in like manner for the microzymas in the
        globules of the blood. It was on this occasion that we made an
        experiment suggested by that observation, which is as follows:</p>
      <p style="background: white"><i>1. C. R.,Vol. LXVIII.p. 408. </i><i><br>
        </i><i> 2. lbid.. Vol. LXIV. p. 713.</i></p>
      <p style="background: white">Dr. Clement Combescure, who,
        alongside of me, had experimented on the blood from the point of
        view of its supposed coagulation in the vessel by an excessive
        consumption of alcoholic drinks, had long ago discovered that
        the blood, received directly from the vessels into alcohol at
        40% to 45%, far from coagulating, dissolved in it.1</p>
      <p style="background: white">The experiment being repeated under
        the same conditions we found that the mixture of blood and
        alcohol remained liquid, appearing limpid, depositing neither
        globules, nor fibrin, but that by degrees it made an abundant
        deposit, which the microscope showed was almost exclusively
        formed of molecular granulations animated by the brownian
        movement.2 It was from this result that we finally reached the
        solution of the problem, but only long after I had resumed the
        study of the fibrin and of its changes.</p>
      <p style="background: white">As I had done in 1869,1 at first
        regarded the molecular granulations of the deposit from the
        alcoholized blood as being the microzymas of the blood or the
        microzymas of the globules. But when I had isolated the
        fibrinous microzymas of an extreme minuteness and after the
        study of the molecular granulations of spontaneously changed
        fibrin, liquified, without becoming fetid, I doubted. Here are
        the consequences of this doubt:</p>
      <p style="background: white"><i>1.&nbsp; Dr. C. Combescure, Theses

      <p style="background: white"> The third anatomical element of the
        blood and the molecular granulations of the blood globules.</p>
      <p style="background: white">The conditions of the experiment for
        isolating the third anatomical element of the blood are as
        follows: Take alcohol, rigorously rectified, free from acid and
        from alkali, and dilute it with distilled water, to bring it to
        from 35 to 40 per cent. Into two volumes of alcohol thus
        diluted, one volume of blood is made to flow directly and
        without interruption as it comes from the vessels. So much for
        the blood as a whole.</p>
      <p style="background: white">For examining blood already
        defibrinated it must be passed through a fine linen cloth, to
        remove the fibrin which</p>
      <div class="Section2">
        <p style="background: white">might be held in suspension, and it
          also is then poured into twice its volume of like diluted
          alcohol.</p>
        <p style="background: white">The mixtures, dark red, being left
          to themselves in a cool place, there is formed by degrees a
          clear red deposit which takes at least 24 hours to be
          completed.</p>
        <p style="background: white">The deposit is much more abundant
          for the entire blood than for the defibrinated.</p>
        <p style="background: white">The deposit is first washed by
          decantation in alcohol at 35 per cent, then on a filter with
          alcohol at 30 per cent., until it is perfectly white. Under
          the microscope the matter resolves itself into an infinite
          number of very fine molecular granula­tions. These
          granulations are mixed with remains of cellules, more abundant
          in a deposit furnished by the defibrinated blood.</p>
        <p style="background: white">I made several determinations of
          these molecular granulations. The following were made upon
          sufficiently large volumes of sheep's blood, by bleeding from
          the jugular vein.</p>
        <p style="background: white">800 c.c. of the whole blood gave
          37.4 gr. of humid granulations completely drained, containing
          5.76 grammes of matter dried at 120° (= 248° F.); that is,
          7.07 grammes of dried granulations per litre of the whole
          blood.</p>
        <p style="background: white">2675 c.c. of the same blood, first
          defibrinated, gave 22.1 gr. of humid granulations, drained,
          and containing 4.87 gr. of matter dried at 120° C.; that is,
          1.82 gr. per litre of defibrinated blood.</p>
        <p style="background: white">But these quantities are far from
          being constant, even for the blood of the same animal. For
          example, one litre of sheep's blood, in another experiment,
          gave only 5.70 gr. of granulations dried at 120° C., and
          another by whipping only, gave 3.15 grammes of fibrin, dried
          at 120° C., per litre.</p>
        <p style="background: white">However it maybe with regard to the
          molecular granulations of defibrinated blood let us consider
          them as representing (as will be hereafter demonstrated) the
          molecular granulations and the envelopes of the destroyed
          globules; the difference 7.07 gr.— 1.82 gr. = 5.25 gr. will
          represent the molecular granulations which the blood without
          the globules will have furnished.</p>
        <p style="background: white">In the "Memoire sur les matieres
          albuminoides," I still considered the molecular granulations
          of which I was treating as being microzymas such as they
          existed in the blood, and I showed that, like the fibrinous
          microzymas, they liquified fecula-starch and decomposed
          oxygenated water. In fact, 1 c.c. of humid molecular
          granulations of the entire blood, disengaged, in 12 hours, 26
          c.c. of oxygen from 2 c.c. of water oxygenated to 15 volumes
          of oxygen; and 1 c.c. of humid molecular granulations of
          defibrinated blood, disengaged, in 12 hours, 23 c.c. of oxygen
          from 2 c.c. of the same oxygenated water.</p>
        <p style="background: white">These granulations possess then the
          properties of the fibrin and of the fibrinous microzymas. But
          are they really isolated microzymas? Are they not precisely
          the fibrin, such as it exists in the blood? That which led me
          to put this question was, first, the observation of molecular
          granulations of the fibrin spontaneously changed and, second,
          that the weight of these granulations is often greater than
          the weight of the fibrin which the same volume of blood was
          able to furnish.</p>
        <p style="background: white">I then treated granulations
          obtained from the blood, diluted in alcohol as I had treated
          those of the altered fibrin, or the fibrin itself, to isolate
          from it the microzymas.</p>
        <p style="background: white">Treatment of the haematic molecular
          granulations with very dilute hydrochloric acid. The humid
          deposit of the isolated granulations is treated with very
          dilute hydrochloric acid; in contrast with what happens to
          fibrin they disappear almost instantaneously at the ordinary
          temperature, even when the acid is diluted to one in a
          thousand. In some min­utes ten grammes were dissolved in a
          cloudy liquid from which microzymas, as small as those of the
          fibrin from whipping, were slowly deposited.</p>
        <p style="background: white">The limpid hydrochloric solution,
          separated from the microzymas, exactly saturated by carbonate
          of ammonia, furnished a precipitate of fibrinine, which when
          well washed does not decompose oxygenated water, while the
          microzymas, isolated and washed, decompose it, etc.</p>
        <p style="background: white">The rotatory power of the materials
          dissolved by the hydrochloric acid was (a) j = —74°.</p>
        <p style="background: white">As to the rotatory power of
          fibrinine, it has been found in acetic solution (a) j =
          —68°.9.</p>
        <p style="background: white">That is to say, perceptibly those
          of the fibrin and of fibrinine of fibrin under the same
          conditions.</p>
        <p style="background: white">The very great difference between
          fibrin in the state of molecular granulations and fibrin
          obtained by whipping resides then essentially in the manner of
          reacting with regard to very dilute hydrochloric acid, the
          solution of ordinary fibrin, being a function of time and of
          temperature.</p>
        <p style="background: white">The blood of the ox and that of the
          rabbit behaved exactly as did that of the sheep. But the blood
          of the duck offered interesting peculiarities, as we shall
          perceive presently.</p>
        <p style="background: white">The only condition for the success
          of the experiment, but rigorously indispensable in every case,
          is that the shed blood shall flow directly from the vessel
          into alcohol at 35-40 per cent., the volume of which should be
          twice that of the blood to be collected. The least interval,
          as, for instance, receiving the blood into a porcelain capsule
          or one of glass, from which to pour it into the diluted
          alcohol is sufficient to compromise the result. Under
          circumstances similar to the last the deposit seemed to be
          made more rapidly and instead of being pulverulent, it was
          flocculent. The deposit, collected as usual, 24 hours</p>
        <div class="Section5">
          <p style="background: white"><i>end page 115 missing</i></p>
          <p style="background: white">which (when poured directly into
            the alcohol) it was effected at once. Hence it results that
            the matter of the molecular granulations of the deposit
            formed by the instantaneous mixture of the blood, as it
            issues from the vessels, with the dilute alcohol, is in a
            state, chemical, physiological and an­atomical nearest to
            that which it assumes in the circulating blood. It is,
            therefore, necessary to obtain the most exact idea of the
            physical constitution of the molecular granulations in that
            condition, in order to understand their constitution in the
            blood at the moment that this is held by its flowing into
            the alcohol.</p>
          <p style="background: white">It is an invariable fact that the
            molecular granulations of the deposit formed by the
            instantaneous mixture of the blood, at the time of the
            bleeding, with twice its volume of alcohol at 35-40 per
            cent, are immediately dissolved by very dilute hydrochloric
            acid to a cloudy liquid containing the microzymas, and that
            at low temperature. And it is a no less invariable fact that
            at the moment of the mixture with alcohol the blood appears
            to be dissolved, so much so that a thin layer of the liquid
            is almost transparent; under the micro­scope no globules are
            seen, and it is with difficulty that one can perceive
            certain particles which are themselves trans­lucent. The
            deposit, which is then made very slowly, is not the result
            of a formation first of all of a precipitate due to some
            reaction or coagulation of some dissolved matter; it is
            quite otherwise, since the globules which swim insoluble in
            the circulating blood are themselves dissolved, while being
            des­troyed. It is further evident that if the deposit had
            been pro­duced by coagulation, by the alcohol, of a
            substance which existed dissolved in the blood and which
            became insoluble in water from the fact of this coagulation,
            but became soluble in very dilute hydrochloric acid, the
            whole should be dissolved by the latter! But the microzymas
            are the persisting insoluble residue of the deposit as they
            are of the fibrin obtained by whipping. But, further, this
            important fact must be borne in mind to which I have already
            called attention that it is precisely when an interval, even
            a very short one elapses between the venesection and the
            mixture of the blood with the alcohol, that the molecular
            granulations o the deposit are not immediately dissolved by
            the dilute hydrochloric acid; that is to say, that a certain
            coagulation has occurred.</p>
          <p style="background: white">We reach then the conclusion that
            the granulations o the deposit formed instantaneously in the
            mixture represent the nearest state to that which they have
            in the blood at the precise moment of the bleeding.</p>
          <p style="background: white">But what is the relation between
            the part soluble in dilute hydrochloric acid of these
            molecular granulation: and the microzymas which remain
            undissolved?</p>
          <p style="background: white">It is the same which I have
            pointed out in the molecular granulations which exist in the
            deposit from the spontaneous alteration of the fibrin in
            carbolated water, WHERE EACH GRANULATION IS ASPHERICAL MASS
            OF ALBUMINOID MATTER HVING A MICROZYMA FOR ITS CENTRE. In
            fact, the molecular granulations of the deposit formed by
            the alcoholized blood are like that, round, spherical,
            motile; that is to say, animated by the brownian movement,
            representing an exceedingly minute mass of albuminoid matter
            having a microzyma for centre. The very dilute hydrochloric
            acid dissolves the enveloping albuminoid matter, leaving the
            central microzyma undisolved.</p>
          <p style="background: white">A microzyma for nucleus,
            enveloped as by an atmosphere by a mass of albuminoid
            matter, insoluble in water, but which very dilute
            hydrochloric acid dissolves, such then is the physical
            constitution of a molecular granulation formed by blood
            diluted in two volumes of alcohol at 35-40 per cent. It may
            be called a microzymian molecular granulation.</p>
          <p style="background: white">But do molecular granulations
            thus constituted exist anatomically? and do any such exist
            in the blood? Yes, and the example is not solitary,1 but the
            haematic microzymian molecular granulation, with its special
            albuminoid atmosphere, is a prime example of this kind. It
            only remains to represent that state of this atmosphere in
            the blood.</p>
          <p style="background: white">I revert to the remark already
            made, that the deposit in the alcoholized blood is not the
            result of the precipitation of some dissolved substance
            contained in the blood, according to the plasma hypothesis.
            But direct observation had already permitted Estor and me to
            declare that the blood, as it issues from the vessels before
            the commencement of the formation of the clot, contains,
            around the globules, an innumerable number of microzymas
            (that which we took for microzymas) most readily to be seen
            in the blood of very young animals— for example, of kittens
            from three to forty days old; and these microzymas we found
            to resemble those of the liver, but more transparent; and we
            did not fail to add that the reason they had escaped the
            attention of histologists was because of their minuteness
            and transparency.2 It was in reality a diligent idea which
            enabled us to find them where they had not before been seen.
            In the defibrinated blood they cannot be found.</p>
          <p style="background: white">1. Before I discovered the
            microzymian molecular granulations with an albuminoid
            atmosphere. I had already observed some of them of another
            kind. In isolating the microzymas of the pancreas, as Estor
            and I had isolated those of the liver, I found them
            enveloped with an atmosphere of complex matter. Treatment
            with alcoholized ether and with water dissolved the matters
            of the enveloping atmosphere and the naked pancreatic
            microzymas became visible with their special minuteness and
            color.</p>
          <p style="background: white"> The vitellin microzymas of the
            yolk of the eggs of birds are also enveloped with a complex
            matter.</p>
          <p style="background: white">When the sort of tissue which
            constitutes the yolk of these eggs is steeped in a good deal
            of distilled water the intergranular materials dissolve and
            the vitellin molecular granulations are deposited,
            spherical, sometimes mixed with vitellin globules. Washing
            with water removes everything which can be dissolved in it;
            then treatment with ether and with alcoholized ether
            dissolves the enveloping matter, a son of alloy, an amalgam
            of fatty bodies and of lecithin. Finally, washing with water
            and again with ether yields the vitellin microzymas of a
            perfectly white color. The vitellin microzymas and the
            pancreatic exist then well enveloped, in the condition of
            microzymian molecular granulations.<br>

          <p style="background: white">That which we took for
            transparent microzymas, visible with difficulty, were the
            haematic microzymian molecular granulations, the same as
            those of the deposit in the alcoholized blood, except that
            the albuminoid atmosphere of the latter is a condensed
            atmosphere, contracted, become opaque, while in the blood it
            is inflated, soft and mucuous, hyaline, and can again, as
            will be presently shown, become inflated in blood, to which
            water had been added. The theory of the phenomenon presented
            by the blood diluted in the alcohol is as follows:</p>
          <p style="background: white">When the blood is directly
            received into the alcohol under the specified conditions,
            its anatomical elements are rudely placed in new conditions
            of existence; while the globules are destroyed and their
            coloring matter (the haemoglobin) dissolves, the soft and
            mucoid atmosphere of the insoluble microzymian molecular
            granulations condenses by degrees and hardens around each
            central microzyma; then, becoming more dense, the
            microzymian molecular granulations are deposited.</p>
          <p style="background: white">And it is because the mucoid
            albuminoid atmosphere, insoluble in water, is condensed and
            hardened, laid hold of as it were, by the alcohol before
            being coagulated, that it is dissolved immediately in very
            dilute hydrochloric acid, while it is modified by
            coagulation, and becomes insoluble in it, as it is in the
            case of fibrin obtained by whipping, if some interval of
            time separates the venesection from the mixing of the blood
            with the alcohol. Once more, the condensed atmosphere of the
            microzymian molecular granulations contains the albuminoid
            matter in the state nearest to, if not identical with, that
            which it had in the blood.</p>
          <p style="background: white">The following experiment will
            instruct us still better as to the nature of the mucoid
            atmosphere of the haematic microzymian molecular
            granulations.</p>
          <p style="background: white"> Experiment upon blood diluted in
            a saturated aqueous solution of sulphate of soda.</p>
          <p style="background: white">It is known that blood mixed with
            several times its volume of a saturated solution of sulphate
            of soda yields no clot and that the globules are deposited
            in the mixture without yielding up their coloring matter.
            Why under these conditions is no clot formed? The following
            is an attempted explanation of the phenomenon. The
            experiment ought to be made in winter in freezing
            temperature.</p>
          <p style="background: white">A volume of sheep's blood is
            received directly from the jugular vein into four times its
            volume of a saturated solution of sulphate of soda and the
            mixture left at rest. Twenty-four hours afterwards the
            greater part of the globules will be deposited. The
            supernatant clear liquid is filtered upon a filter lined
            with sulphate of barium,1 in order to retain the globules
            and the microzymas which remain in suspension. The
            filtration is necessarily slow. The filtered liquid, almost
            colorless, is absolutely clear; mixed with oxygenated water,
            it slowly sets free a little oxygen.</p>
          <p style="background: white">1. The lining with sulphate of
            barium is made as follows: The filter should be without a
            fold; it must be filled with liquid, into which a suitably
            diluted solution of chloride of barium has been precipitated
            by a similar solution of sulphate of soda; the filtrate is
            to be again poured on the filler until that which passes is
            perfectly clear. It must be so arranged that the bed of
            sulphate of baryta be at least half a millimetre in
            thickness. Finally the filter is to be washed with a
            solution of sulphate of soda.</p>
          <p style="background: white">The liquid which had remained
            limpid during the whole period of filtration (about 20
            hours) furnishes by agitation a small mass of fibrin of a
            brilliant whiteness, having the membranous appearance of the
            fibrin obtained by whip­ping. The liquid separated from this
            matter, again filtered on a filter lined with sulphate of
            baryta, also sets oxygen free from oxygenated water.</p>
          <p style="background: white">The fibrin separated from the
            filtered liquid of the mixture of blood and of sulphate of
            soda, that is to say, a fibrin without microzymas, does not
            set free oxygen from oxygenated water, but dissolves in it.</p>
          <p style="background: white">A mass of this fibrin without
            microzymas, about 1 c.c. being placed in 8 c.c. of
            oxygenated water having six volumes of oxygen, did not set
            oxygen free even after six days of contact (at least not
            more than would have been set free from it without the
            addition), but the fibrin had disappeared; it was dissolved.
            And the solution was albuminoid, for on treating with
            Millin's re-agent, a white precipitate appeared which became
            red on slightly heating it.</p>
          <p style="background: white">As to the clear liquid separated
            from this fibrin without microzymas, it gave, on acetic acid
            being carefully added, a slight albuminoid precipitate which
            has not been further examined. But the liquor separated from
            this precipitate contained a soluble albuminoid matter
            precipitated by alco­hol, which, in acetic solution, had a
            rotatory power: (a) j= — 86°, very different from that of
            seralbumine.</p>
          <p style="background: white">From this experiment we may
            conclude that the microzymian molecular granulations are,
            like the globules, insoluble in blood, where the conditions
            of their anatomical integrity exist united; but the blood
            being diluted in the solution of sulphate of soda, although
            the globules remain insoluble, the albuminoid substance
            which forms the soft atmosphere of the microzymian
            granulations is dissolved in the new medium, at least in
            part, undergoing doubtless some transformation. In fact,
            while by agitation a part is separated in the condition of
            an insoluble mass1 having the membran­ous appearance of
            fibrin, another part remains dissolved and can be separated
            from it, and has a rotatory power greater than that of
            seralbumin. The fact of the change is also evident from
            this; that the insoluble matter of fibrinous appearance is
            dissolved in oxygenated water without setting oxygen free.
            And if the limpid liquid of the filtration before and after
            the separation of this fibrinous substance sets free a
            little oxygen from the oxygenated water, it is because some
            of the matter which, in the microzymas, effects this
            disengagement is diffused in it. Thus the direct experiment
            demonstrates that that which in the fibrin decomposes the
            oxygenated water are the microzymas; the intermicrozymian
            mass or the enveloping albuminoid matter does not decompose
            it; thus constituting a verification of the facts
            established in the first chapter; so much so that it is
            unnecessary to add that the defibrinated blood, treated with
            sulphate of soda, does not yield any fibrinous substance.</p>
          <p style="background: white">1. There is nothing to be
            surprised at in this spontaneous passage from the dissolved
            state to an insoluble state. There is a parallel case in a
            modification of amylaceous matter, which, from a condition
            of perfect solution, passes by degrees, in the liquor
            itself, to an insoluble stale.</p>
          <p style="background: white">Such are the facts. But these
            microzymian granulations, which Estor and I took for
            microzymas, had they not been already perceived? On this
            subject the following is the only information I have been
            able to collect:</p>
          <p style="background: white">"There is to be found, says M.
            Frey,1 in human blood besides globules agglomerations of
            small pale granulations 0.00 l mm to 0.002 mm in diameter
            (Schultze); adding that these granulations, which had been
            noticed before, showed themselves sometimes with active
            movements of protoplasm, sometimes with a molecular movement
            (brownian move­ment). "2</p>

          <p style="background: white">Further these molecular
            granulations had been observed in other humors and animal
            tissues and many opinions had been expressed as to their
            role, but it was not known what that role was, nor whether
            they were organized.</p>
          <p style="background: white">Now, thanks to the anatomical
            analysis of blood treated with alcohol, the existence of the
            molecular granulations of the blood is certain, it remains
            to explain how such an observer as J. Muller did not see
            them and could have maintained, under microscopic
            examination, that, except the globules, the whole of the
            rest of the blood was in a state of perfect solution. To
            understand this, it is sufficient to take into consideration
            the anatomical and physical constitution of the haematic
            microzymian molecular granulations in the blood; a
            microzyma, (whose diameter at the most is 0.0005 mm) and is
            enveloped in an atmosphere of a soft substance, mucous and
            hyaline. But in the blood this mucous atmosphere when much
            inflated may have the same refractive power as the
            surrounding liquid, it is not then surprising, the central
            microzyma being so very small, that it escaped microscopic
            observation; in fact, it only becomes visible when the
            albuminoid matter of the enveloping atmosphere, outside of
            the vessels, begins to undergo the allotropic modifications
            which cause it to acquire the properties which it possesses
            in the fibrin.</p>
          <p style="background: white">To convince oneself that this
            interpretation is a true one, it is sufficient to consider
            crystallin, the transparency whereof is perfect.
            Nevertheless, anatomically, crystallin is constituted by two
            layers of crystalline tubes; further it contains, like other
            anatomical elements, a crowd of micro-zymas; all this the
            microscope is incapable of showing directly because all the
            parts have in the entire organ the same refractive index.
            But so soon as, by grinding, this organization is destroyed,
            the conditions of existence of the anatomical elements of
            the organ being altered, microzymas and crystalline tubes
            become visible.</p>
          <p style="background: white">To sum up; the facts of this
            chapter establish definitely that the blood contains a third
            anatomical element, as constant, as necessary as the
            globules, consisting of a microzyma enveloped in an
            atmosphere of a special albuminoid substance, insoluble in
            the sanguineous medium. This anatomical element, heretofore
            unrecognized, because of its anatomical constitution, its
            location and its properties, I have named haematic
            microzymian molecular granulation.</p>
          <p style="background: white">And now, when one considers that
            the weight of these microzymian molecular granulations,
            deduction made of the molecular granulations which are
            furnished by the same volume of defibrinated blood,
            represents very nearly the weight of the fibrin obtained
            from the same volume of blood by whipping, it becomes
            evident that ordinary fibrin is nothing else than the
            microzymian granulations, heaped up and soldered together,
            whose albuminoid atmosphere has undergone, outside of the
            vessel, an allotropic modification, by virtue of which, from
            having been directly soluble in very dilute hydrochloric
            acid, it has become soluble in it, only as a function of
            time and of temperature.</p>
          <p style="background: white">We shall see how the anatomic
            constitution of the haematic microzymian granulations and
            the properties of their enveloping albuminoid atmosphere
            explain at the same time, mechanically, the phenomenon of
            the spontan­eous coagulations of the blood and the
            production of the fibrin by whipping. Meantime let us say
            that the foregoing demonstrations destroy the hypothesis of
            the plasma and verify, while completing, the conceptions of
            Hewson, of Milne-Edwards, of J. B. Dumas, regarding the
            existence of the fibrin in the condition of fine
            granulations in the blood.<br>

          <p style="background: white">An exact knowledge of the
            physical constitution and of the anatomical structure of the
            red globule is of great im­portance to the scope of this
            work. Is or is not the red globule of the blood a cellular
            anatomic element, constituted by an envelope with its
            content; or is it a kind of naked anatomical element, as was
            said of the milk globules? An alternative, necessary to be
            resolved, to obtain a clear idea of the role of the red
            globule!</p>
          <p style="background: white">Prevost and Dumas1 admitted that
            there was an envelope to the red globule and, later, Henle,2
            by exact observations, demonstrated the reality of the
            existence of this envelope. In 1856, Kuss taught us in his
            course on physiology, at Strasbourg, that "the blood
            globules are not bladders, but compact organs, solid in all
            their parts, the least aqueous of all the organs of the
            body." More than twenty years afterwards, M. Frey,
            interpreting the general opinion, said: "To sum up, the
            globule maybe regarded as a mass of gelatinous substance
            saturated with water."3 And he added: "In spite of the
            difficulties of observation and the uncertainty of such
            examinations, some authors have pronounced themselves,
            during these later years, in favor of the existence of a
            cellular membrane."</p>

            considered them as having a cellular constitution, but as
            individual living beings, saying that the deprivation of
            oxygen was fatal to them. Such was not the physiologists'
            point of view; and I cannot give a better proof of this than
            the following:</p>
          <p style="background: white">I had compared the scintillating
            corpuscle of the pebrine to a cellule already acknowledged
            to be alive, such as that of the globule of yeast. M.
            Pasteur asserted that this was an error and, referring to
            it, made the following statement: "My present opinion is
            that these corpuscles are neither animals nor plants. * * *
            From the point of view of a methodical classification they
            should be placed rather alongside of globules of pus or
            blood globules, or still better, of grains of starch rather
            than alongside of infusoria and moulds;"1 and later: the
            corpuscle "is a production which is neither animal nor
            vegetable and incapable of reproduction, and it must be
            placed in the category of those bodies, regular in form,
            which physiology has for some years distinguished by the
            name of organites, such as globules of blood, globules of
            pus, etc."2</p>

          <i> </i>
          <p style="background: white">It is evident that that which is
            neither plant nor animal has neither organized structure nor
            life; has no content in an envelope. But that was the state
            of science, and that which M. Pasteur believed regarding the
            blood globule and regarding pus, was believed of every other
            anatomical element, for instance, of the spermatozoids,
            comprised in the "etc." of M. Pasteur, and which he compared
            to grains of starch, under the name of organites, i.e.,
            simulacra of organs. If I insist particularly on this
            savant's mode of viewing these things it is because he has
            specially occupied himself about the blood and thence about
            what happens to its globules during its spontaneous changes.</p>
          <p style="background: white">It is no idle question to inquire
            whether the blood glob­ule is naked or covered, furnished
            with an envelope separate from its mass. The property of a
            living body as to whose organization there is no dispute,
            whether it relates to an animal or to a globule of yeast, is
            to be limited in its form by a continuous enveloping
            membrane (distinct from its interior medium), which lakes
            the name of tegument, a word of which the etymological
            meaning is clear; the enveloping membrane of the cellule is
            then the same as the tegument. In the organism the interior
            organs are individualised by their own tegument. Among
            bodies which can only realize the conditions of their
            existence in water or in aqueous media, the insoluble
            tegument, endowed besides with special osmotic properties,
            protects the content, or the interior medium, against being
            dissolved or from other like change. Well! the blood globule
            like beer-yeast, is individualized by its tegument: hence it
            is an organ and not an organite.</p>
          <p style="background: white">That which has given rise to
            doubt as to the existence of a tegument to the red globule
            is that the blood steeped in water seems to be altogether
            dissolved in it: the globules disappear so completely that
            under the microscope not a vestige of them can be
            discovered. Those who, like Dumas, admitted an envelope,
            thought that it was broken and thus explained why the weight
            of the isolated fibrin of the clot was greater than that
            obtained by whipping. But, as we shall presently see, that
            apparent solution of the globules is only the osmotic
            issuance of the interior part, soluble in water, across the
            envelope: the cellular tegument remaining entire is
            invisible under the microscope only because its refracting
            index is the same as that of the ambient liquid.</p>
          <p style="background: white"> Demonstration that the red
            globule is a real cellule having microzymas for anatomical
            elements.</p>
          <p style="background: white">The mode of demonstrating the
            unbroken tegument of the red globule of the blood, steeped
            in water, consists in rendering its refraction different
            from that of the liquid which results from this mixture. To
            do this the blood, defibrinated or not, is to be mixed with
            an equal volume of a solution of about 15 per cent, of
            creosoted soluble fecula; at the end of 24 hours one can see
            that the globules resist the contact with the water much
            better, the envelope being clearly visible. The experiment
            is most striking with the blood of the duck; in one of them,
            which had lasted three weeks, successive washings with a
            solution of soluble fecula and with water removed all the
            coloring matter, leaving for residue colorless globules,
            where the nucleus could be seen rolling about in the
            water-logged globule; sometimes even the colorless tegument
            could be seen to wrap itself around the nucleus. The
            tegumentary vesicle, after these washings, has sometimes
            become so pale that it was only visible after an addition of
            an iodide paint which colors it yellow; but it is not
            colored by the ammoniac solution of carmin, nor by that of
            the picrocarminate.</p>
          <p style="background: white">I have also similarly
            experimented on the blood of a fowl, of a pigeon, of a frog,
            of a dog, of an ox, of a guinea-pig; in all cases the
            vesicle is seen entire, but among the elliptical globules
            having a nucleus those of the fowl deserve more attention.
            And it is to be noticed that, in experiments which take up a
            long time, the nucleus of the blood globules of a bird ends
            by being resolved into fine molecular granulations which can
            be seen in the colorless envelope which remains whole. In
            the emptied vesicles of the circular globules, nuclei are
            never to be seen.1</p>
          <p style="background: white">After the publication of these
            experiments Profs. J. Bechamp and E. Baltus described the
            process of tinting by which in all cases the unbroken
            cellular tegument may be distinguished, even in blood merely
            steeped in water.2</p>

          <i> </i>
          <p style="background: white">But that is not all: if there is
            no cellule without envelope, neither is there one without
            microzymas. The blood globules are, in fact, no exception.
            On the other hand, as I have before mentioned, in certain
            experiments the decolored vesicles of the blood vessels of
            the duck, emptied of their coloring matter, contained their
            nucleus reduced to molecular granula­tions; on the other
            hand, I have stated that the deposit of molecular
            granulations formed in defibrinated blood, with two volumes
            of alcohol, 35-40 per cent, added, came from the destroyed
            globules of this blood. It is necessary then, by direct
            experiment, to put this beyond doubt, the doing of which has
            brought to light some particularly interesting observations.</p>
          <p style="background: white">To solve the problem of the
            existence of these molecular granulations in the globules of
            the blood, these latter were isolated from the defibrinated
            blood, separated from all trace of fibrin by filtration on
            fine cloth, and four times its volume of a saturated
            solution of sulphate of soda, or of an analogous salt, was
            added to it.</p>
          <p style="background: white">Molecular granulations of the
            globules of ox blood.</p>
          <p style="background: white">The globules being received upon
            a filter with the usual precautions are washed once more
            with sulphate of soda, and are then treated with alcohol of
            35-40 per cent., which ought to dissolve the coloring
            matter; this was, in fact, done by a washing in this alcohol
            until discoloration was as complete as possible and finally
            with water; the filter retains the molecular granulations
            mixed with the remains of the cellular envelopes, possessing
            the appearance and properties of those obtained from
            defibrinated blood treated directly with alcohol.</p>
          <p style="background: white">The peculiarities already
            presented by the globules of the bloods of the duck and of
            the fowl induced me to repeat these experiments upon these
            bloods.</p>
          <p style="background: white"> Molecular granulations of the
            globules of fowl's blood.</p>
          <p style="background: white">The globules separated from the
            defibrinated blood of the fowl by the saturated solution of
            sulphate of soda are received upon a filter and treated in
            the same manner as was ox-blood, with alcohol at 35-40 per
            cent., until deprived of their color; while the washing was
            made with alcohol, the colorless residue upon the filter
            seemed pulverulent, as in the case of the ox's globules; but
            by continuing the water washing the pulverulent mass was
            transformed into a mucous mass. Then, much surprised, I made
            this further experiment.</p>
          <p style="background: white">The defibrinated blood of another
            fowl was treated as usual by twice its volume of 35-40 per
            cent, alcohol. The pulverulent deposit of molecular
            granulations was obtained in the ordinary way; the deposit
            received upon a filter and washed with weak alcohol became
            white, remaining pulverulent; but so soon as water was added
            the matter assumed the mucous condition of the granulations
            of isolated elliptical blood globules.</p>
          <p style="background: white">The mucous mass sets free the
            oxygen from oxygenated water; it dissolves only with
            difficulty in hydrochloric acid at 2/1000.</p>
          <p style="background: white">As a consequence, from this it is
            clear that the albuminoid atmosphere of the microzymian
            molecular granulations of the blood globules of the fowl,
            which assume the mucous state in water, is formed of a
            different substance from that of the atmospheres of the
            blood globules of the ox. We have already seen that the
            fibrin of fowl's blood, yielded by whipping, is scarcely
            attacked by hydrochloric acid. The granulations of the
            globules of the same blood having become mucous have the
            same property.</p>
          <p style="background: white"> Molecular granulations of the
            globules of the duck's blood.</p>
          <p style="background: white">The red globules of the duck,
            isolated from the defibrinated blood by sulphate of soda,
            are also treated on the filter by alcohol at 35-40 per cent.
            The most prolonged washing with this alcohol does not at all
            discolor the molecular granulations; much more abundant than
            in the fowl's blood they remain, until the end, colored of a
            brownish red. Is it, otherwise, with those of the deposit of
            the same defibrinated blood treated with alcohol?</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Section20">
          <p style="background: white">The defibrinated blood of the
            duck treated at the moment bleeding, with two volumes of the
            same alcohol, rapidly gives a deposit much more abundant
            that does the defibrinated blood of the sheep. The deposit
            formed chiefly of the molecular granulations is not
            decolored by the washings with alcohol and with water, and
            remains of a brownish red.&nbsp; Treated with very diluted
            hydrochloric acid it yields colored solutions.</p>
          <p style="background: white">The bloods of the fowl and the
            duck deserve a more complete study than, to my regret, I
            have been able to make.&nbsp; For the results prove that the
            globules, elliptical in form and with a nucleus, differ not
            only by their forms from the circular globules, but further
            that they differ among themselves. These two facts, and
            those relating to the blood of the ox, prove that from this
            time forth we have to study, not only the blood, but the
            bloods, perhaps as much in the properties of their
            anatomical elements as in that of their albuminoid
            components, and especially of their haemoglobins.</p>
          <p style="background: white">However that may be, it remains
            proved that the blood globules in general are not only
            constituted upon the model of the perfect cellule, but that
            by a sojourn of the blood in a solution of fecula the
            refracting index of the tegument of the globules is modified
            without modifying its osmotic properties.</p>
          <p style="background: white">Further, it has been demonstrated
            that the blood globules themselves have, for anatomical
            elements, molecular granulations constituted like the
            haematic microzymian molecular granulations, as well the
            circular blood globules, as the elliptic, and that the
            molecular granulations of of one blood globule may differ
            from those of another. The physiology of the blood will be a
            great gainer by the study of of other special cases.1</p>
          <p style="background: white"><i>1. This remark gives
              importance to the following: "The whole of the small
              family of Chameleons presents the singular exception that
              their blood globules are elliptical. But nothing like it
              has been found in other animals of the same class and
              nevertheless the bloods have been examined of more than
              200 species chosen among all the natural subdivisions of
              the group, including even the marsupials and the
              monotrema, which, in certain respects, seem to establish
              the passage between the normal mammifera and the oviparous
              vertebrates. No adult bird is known whose blood globules
              are not elliptical. It is the same with reptiles,
              batrachians and ordinary fishes. Among cartilaginous
              fishes the lampreys, for example, the form of the globules
              is nearly circular." (Milne-Edwards, "Physiologic
              comparee. Vol. I, p. 48, etc., edition of 1857).</i><i><br>

            The form, the external characters, among all living beings,
            are allied to the entirely of their other properties. Why
            should it not be the same with their blood globules and
            their other anatomical elements?<br>

          <p style="background: white">The blood really contains three
            kinds of anatomical elements: the red globules, the white
            globules and the microzymian molecular granulations.
            Anatomically, the blood is constituted by three sorts of
            figured elements and, by a fourth term, a liquid. Is this
            the serum, this liquid which is its interglobular and
            intergranular substance?</p>
          <p style="background: white">The three sorts of anatomical
            elements are living, insomuch as they are organized and
            contain microzymas which I have proved to be living by their
            function as ferments and by their capacity to become
            vibrioniens by individual evolution, which was a novelty for
            physiology and even for chemists.</p>
          <p style="background: white">Nevertheless, so far as concern
            the red globule, since 1846 the statement that it is alive
            was not a novelty. In fact, in a memoir,1 which merits the
            more attention that it is never quoted, J. B. Dumas made an
            observation which must be regarded as of the first
            importance. It is that to isolate the red globules in their
            integrity, by mixing the blood with sulphate of soda, a
            current of air must be introduced; without this they will
            change, losing their coloring matter which itself also
            changes. And he said: "The globules of blood act as though
            they were really living beings, capable of resisting the
            solvent action of sulphate of soda so long as they are
            alive, but yielding to this action so soon as they have
            succumbed to the asphyxiation which affects them by the
            deprivation of air, and which manifests itself with singular
            rapidity, either by their change of color or by their rapid
            solution."&nbsp; Dumas asserted clearly that the globules
            breathe; that account must be taken of their membrane in
            explaining the phenomenon of respiration; and that the
            breathing of an animal has especially for its object to
            furnish oxygen to the globules of its blood and to expel
            "the products into which they convert it." He also remarked
            that in the discussions and the calculations respecting
            respiration the blood had always been regarded as a
            homogeneous liquid, while it was only the serum which
            possesses this quality. He in no wise disregarded the part
            taken by the serum in the phenomenon of arterialization, but
            he insisted on the preponderant part taken in it by the red
            globules.</p>
          <p style="background: white"><i>1. Dumas, "Recherches sur le
              sang," C. R.. Vol. XXII, p. 900 (1846).</i></p>
          <i> </i>
          <p style="background: white">To understand the blood, one must
            place oneself in the order of ideas of the memoir of Dumas,
            but broadened; that illustrious savant did not recognize in
            it, nor did any one else at that time, other anatomical
            elements than the globules, but there is another. He saw in
            the blood only three nitrogenous organic matters: albumen,
            fibrin and the globules, but there are others.</p>
          <p style="background: white">I will add that, in the serum, he
            made allowance for the share therein of the phosphates and
            other mineral matters.</p>
          <p style="background: white">At the moment of a general
            venesection the blood has been regarded as being that which
            it is in the vessels while it circulates in them, but as
            being a mixture of the arterial and venous bloods; and we
            have seen that at this moment the blood is so thoroughly
            regarded as being alive that it was regarded as certain that
            coagulation was its death.</p>
          <p style="background: white">The blood being alive, it is
            necessary to recognize, in accordance with the doctrine of
            Bichat, that, as in all the rest of the organism, the only
            things living in it are the anatomical elements, that is to
            say, that of the four parts which constitute it, the three
            kinds of anatomical elements are the only things living in
            it; the fourth, the serum, or that which will become the
            serum, the interglobular and intergranular substance,
            fulfilling with regard to them only one of the conditions of
            existence.</p>
          <p style="background: white">But as this conclusion conflicts
            with the prejudices of the schools, it is necessary to know
            what those prejudices are to combat them, for they are the
            negations of the doctrine of Bichat and precisely contrary
            to it. In fact, while it is asserted that the globules of
            blood, in general the anatomical elements, are only
            organites, neither plants, nor animals, as M. Pasteur said,
            that is to say, not living although organised, it was
            insisted that that which in the blood is still called plasma
            was living, a liquid whereof all the materials are said to
            be in a state of perfect solution, that is to say, without
            any anatomic, figured structure. But it is well to repeat
            that such was the state of science just as it was before
            Lavoisier and before Bichat, when the philosophical
            naturalist, Charles Bonnet, speaking of the organization,
            called it "the most excellent modification of matter." Even
            in France a conception more or less analogous to it, that of
            protoplasm, was preferred to the striking conception of
            Bichat. But protoplasm or its synonym, blastema, was
            considered to be organized living matter without structure.
            Here is one of the most precise descriptions of such matter:
            "A completely homogenous, amorphous matter without structure
            can be regarded as organized substance if it is constituted
            of numerous proximate principles, united molecule to
            molecule by special combination and reciprocal solution, and
            however simple may be this organization, it is sufficient to
            enable one to say that it is alive." Diet, de Med., Littre
            et Robin, art. Organique (1878).</p>
          <p style="background: white">Van Tieghem said: "Protoplasm is
            a mixture with water, of a greater or less number of
            different proximate principles, in the course of continual

              See letter of M. Pasteur to M. Donne. M. Pasteur's manner
              of thinking was still that of Chevreul [born in 1786. was
              still alive and active in 1856]— at the time (1810) of the
              foundation of his chair at the Museum; Chevreul said,
              speaking of living bodies, that they are organic bodies in
              contradistinction to inorganic bodies, which we term
              minerals. Buffon called minerals gross matter, admitting
              that there was a universally diffused organic matter which
              he termed organic molecules, but Buffon wrote before the
              time of Lavoisier. Chevreul spoke of the proximate
              principles of organic bodies which are the products of
              life. Pasteur, speaking of the same proximate principles,
              says that they are natural substances elaborated by life,
              which have powers of transformation, etc. It may thus be
              truly said that there was no idea of life as bound to a
              determined, structural form of living anatomical elements,
              according to the conception of Bichat. It is thus to be
              understood how M. Pasteur could class in the same
              category, as organites, the red globules of the blood and
              grains of starch. It is true that the amylaceous granule
              had been regarded as being a vesicle, but Biot and Payen
              had shown that it was solid throughout its mass, and I
              have proved, in my researches upon fecula, that it had
              neither tegument, nor microzymas, being wholly formed of
              amylaceous matter contaminated with a trace of albuminoid
              matter.</i><i><br>
            </i><i> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the microzymian theory it is
              not life which produces or elaborates the proximate
              principles, but the anatomical elements are constituted
              into living apparatus by the microzymas, according to the
              same mechanism by which the fibrinous microzymas cause
              starch to ferment, and elaborate the numerous proximate
              principles which I have described as produced in that
              fermentation.</i></p>
          <i> </i>
          <p style="background: white">These quotations are sufficient.
            Protoplasm is regarded as a pure mixture of proximate
            principles, that is to say, of materials of a purely
            chemical order. M. Cauvet and others, M. Frey, for instance,
            have observed the granulations of the protoplasm, but they
            were supposed to be pure proximate principles. This mixture
            was declared by some, as in the course of continual
            transformation; by M. Pasteur, as endowed with faculties of
            transformation, but without other proof of what is precisely
            the point in question, viz., whether such a mixture can
            spontaneously change, can alter itself, give birth to any
            living being whatever, be it a cellule or a microzyma. If
            protoplasm were that which it was thought to be, the
            conception of Bichat would be purely chimerical.</p>
          <p style="background: white">I have incontestably
            demonstrated, in contradiction to the theory of protoplasm
            and against M. Pasteur, that every mixture, artificial or
            natural, of real proximate principles, with water, is, by
            itself, in every way unalterable, incapable of giving birth
            to anything living; in short, as not being in the course of
            continual transformation and as not possessing any faculty
            of transformation capable of producing in it any spontaneous
            alteration. And if in such a mixture, boiling destroys the
            "faculties of transformation" of some zymas, this latter had
            not been produced spontaneously, it was the product of a
            living organism. In short, if the mixture contains some
            proximate principle which can be altered by oxygenation, by
            absorbing oxygen from the air, this principle is itself the
            former product of a living organism through the reaction of
            a zymas.1&nbsp; I have given positive proof of all of this
            while studying the conditions of the spontaneous coagulation
            of milk, which was said to be a pure mixture of proximate
            principles. Cow's milk, creosoted by a suitable dose to
            destroy the influence of the germs of the air and completely
            protected from all contact with the air, first becomes sour
            and then coagulates. After which, vibrioniens appear in it.
            If by filtration, by the process which I have indicated in
            the case of the blood, both the globules and all the milk
            microzymas of the creosoted milk are absolutely removed, the
            limpid liquid which results, containing all the proximate
            principles of the milk, under the same conditions, does not
            become sour and consequently neither coagulates nor permits
            the appearance of the vibrioniens. The "faculties of
            transformation" then resided in the anatomical element of
            the milk which had been removed by filtration, and not in
            the rest of its substance, which maybe called the
            physiological serum of milk.</p>
          <p style="background: white"><i>1. The zymases are never the
              products of the spontaneous alteration of an albuminoid
              matter, but are always the products of the physiological
              function of a living organism and of an anatomical element
              in the latter. See the article zymas, "Dictionnaire de la
              langue francaise." Littre (1869).</i></p>
          <i> </i>
          <p style="background: white">The physiological serum of the
            milk, which has the same composition as blastema or of
            protoplasm, is then naturally unchangeable and consequently
            not living.</p>
          <p style="background: white">It is the same with the fourth
            portion of the blood, which we will call the physiological
            serum of the latter. And precisely as the anatomical
            elements of milk are the agents of its spontaneous
            alteration, because they are living, so the anatomical
            elements of the blood are, on several accounts, the agents
            of its spontaneous alteration, as will be proved in the
            following chapter. But first must be determined the
            physiological role of this serum, in which are realized the
            conditions of existence of the anatomical elements, globules
            and granulations of the blood, while it circulates and after
            it has been shed.</p>
          <p style="background: white">I understand by "conditions of
            existence" of an anatomical element (following Bichat's
            conception), that of the preservation of its physical being
            at the same time with the integrity of its tegument and that
            of its content, preserved with its composition unchanged,
            which it can only be by finding in the medium in which it
            lives all the materials for its nutrition.</p>
          <p style="background: white">Take, for example, the red
            globules; we know that in blood, steeped in a certain
            quantity of water, the soluble contents of its globules are
            diffused by osmose, the teguments remaining whole; on the
            other hand, we know that in the same blood, steeped in
            several times its volume of a saturated solution of sulphate
            of soda, its globules remain entire, both tegument and
            content. We can even steep the blood in its own serum,
            without the globules being altered ; without any trace of
            the colored content being dissolved.&nbsp; And it is the
            same with the molecular granulations as with the globules;
            so that if in blood, steeped in the solution of sulphate of
            soda, a small part of their albuminoid atmosphere is
            temporarily soluble, as we have seen, it is absolutely
            insoluble in the serum and each granulation remains there
            whole and independent, the same as each globule, and this
            constitutes one of the conditions of the circulation.</p>
          <p style="background: white">But to understand the circulation
            and the reciprocal influence of the vessels and of the
            elements of their content, a slight diversion into
            embryology is indispensable.</p>
          <p style="background: white">In studying the development of
            the fowl to ascertain the role of the microzymas of the
            vitellus in the formation of the anatomical elements and of
            the organs, Estor and shown1 that the container and the
            content of the vascular system are born and developed
            simultaneously with the aid of the microzymas and the
            unorganized materials of the vitellus. We have never seen
            globules in the body of the embryo before the establishment
            of the circulation; they are formed on the spot. Thus the
            anatomical elements of the tissues of the vessels and the
            anatomical elements of the blood contained therein are born
            at the same time, by the microzymas of the vitellus as
            builders, in the unorganized intermicrozymian medium of the
            vitellus. Hence it results that the serum of the embryonal
            blood comes into existence concurrently with the globules
            and the granulations, having the non-organized parts of the
            vitellus for their source. To sum up, container and content
            are born at the same time, develop at the same time, and at
            the same time become what they are destined to be in the
            future.</p>
          <p style="background: white"><i>1. C. R., Vol. LXXV, p. 962
              (1872). We were led to undertake this embryological
              experiment as the consequence of the following experiment
              of which Estor was a witness: The mother of vinegar formed
              a microzymas, united among themselves by a hyaline
              intermicrozymian substance, is a membrane of mucous
              consistence with which we have compared the false membrane
              called fibrin; but it is so much vegetable that it is
              hardly nitrogenized. But in the "mother of vinegar," under
              the conditions in which one forces its microzymas to live,
              these become by individual evolution bacteria, or by
              association manufacturers of cellules. It is the same with
              the microzymas of beer-yeast, which, in certain media, act
              as lactic and butyric ferments, undergoing vibrionian
              evolution; while in others they reproduce the cellule of
              yeast and the normal alcoholic fermentation." *</i><i><br>
            </i><i> </i><br>
            The microzymas then can be manufacturers of cellules by
            grouping themselves together, and being grouped becoming
            enveloped with a tegument when the conditions of existence
            of these cellules are united. And it is precisely this which
            the vitellin microzymas do during embryonic development.<br>
            <br>
            This new theory of the origin of the cellule does not weaken
            the axiom of M. Virchow: omnis cellulae cellula.&nbsp; One
            cellule may be derived from another cell according to
            another mode, that is all.<br>
            <br>
            Consequently, when M. Pasteur said that the globule of the
            blood is an organite incapable of reproduction because it
            could not be cultivated like beer-yeast, he was mistaken,
            not knowing any other mode of reproduction.<br>

          <i> </i>
          <p style="background: white">The blood ought to be studied not
            only by itself, but as being to the vessels that which the
            content of a cellule or of an organ is to its tegument. The
            tegument of the vascular system consists of the various
            tissues of the arteries, of the veins and of the
            capillaries. It must also be borne in mind that the system
            is directly in relation with the heart, the lungs, the
            liver, etc., and that the lymphatics (the chyle vessels)
            communicate directly with it. And as the content of a
            cellule, of an organ, does not exist without the container,
            so also the blood does not exist without the vessels which
            contain it and which make of the whole system an organ in
            more or less direct relation with every part of the
            organism.a And it must be observed that if there is any
            difference between the anatomical constitution of the
            container of the various regions of the vascular system
            there is also a difference in their content. Independently
            of the color there is more oxygen and less carbonic acid in
            the arterial blood than in the venous. In several regions
            differences have been observed in the portion of the number
            of blood globules to that of the leukocytes. Lehmann
            observed that if the blood obtained from the portal vein
            gives fibrin by whipping, that of the suprahepatic vein does
            not furnish any by this means, proving, as we shall see,
            that the microzymian molecular granulations of the two
            bloods differ in something, and Denis has already pointed
            out that the fibrin of the arterial blood is not identical
            with that of the venous blood, etc.</p>
          <p style="background: white"><i>[a&nbsp; This original
              conception throws a new light upon the purpose and
              relations of the circulatory system, which I hope to
              enlarge upon in a future memoir.—Trans.]</i></p>
          <i> </i>
          <p style="background: white">Consequently it is
            physiologically evident that the anatomical elements,
            conceived as being personally and in individually living
            from whatever part of an organism they may be taken exist
            there only because the conditions of their existence are
            found naturally realized there. It is not otherwise with the
            blood; the conditions of existence of its anatomical
            elements are only realized, in each point of the circuit,
            while it is contained in the vessel and circulating.</p>
          <p style="background: white">It is ordinarily said that the
            anatomical elements swim in the lymph, the liquor sanguinis
            or the plasma; those who, with Milne-Edwards, admitted the
            existence of finely divided fibrin, said that it too floated
            in the serum. Anatomically, may we continue so to regard the
            reciprocal relations of the three anatomical elements and of
            the fourth portion of the blood?&nbsp; And is it correct to
            say that at each point of the blood current there are
            molecular granulations and globules almost in contact with
            one another? Is it not more correct to say that the fourth
            part, the serum, is only the intercellular and intergranular
            substance of these anatomical elements which hinder their
            immediate contact, a situation analogous to that which is
            correctly admitted to exist between the anatomical elements
            of the other tissues? But, if this relation really exists
            for the blood contained in the vessels, must we not say that
            the blood not only is not a liquid, but that it is a tissue
            like that of the content of the spleen, or of the liver, or
            of the kidney which are more or less flaccid? The softness
            of the tissue of the content of the vessels is much greater,
            that is all; we must then say that the blood is a flowing
            tissue.</p>
          <p style="background: white">The flowing state of the blood
            tissue is related at the same time to the soft consistence,
            gelatinous it has been called, and to the elasticity of the
            globules, whose tegument is incessantly lubricated by the
            intercellular liquor; to the much softer consistence of the
            swollen albuminoid atmosphere of the microzymian molecular
            granulations whose density is nearly equal to that of the
            serum; to the absolute insolubility of the globules and of
            the molecular granulations in the intercellular liquor,
            which again contributes to their individual independence.
            This general insolubility of the anatomical elements is
            assured, at every point of the circuit, by the stability and
            even the origin of the composition of the very complex
            intercellular liquor, resulting from the nutritive
            functioning of the anatomical elements of the container and
            of the content, and at the same time by the matters
            contributed by the divers organs with which the circulatory
            system is in relation, and especially with the respiratory
            apparatus.</p>
          <p style="background: white">At the moment that the blood is
            shed it may be regarded as being the same flowing tissue
            that it was in the vessels. Nevertheless, there is already a
            profound difference, viz., it is not only a mixture of
            venous and arterial blood, but of the bloods of all the
            regions, whose anatomical elements are violently placed in
            new conditions of existence, very different from their
            physiological conditions.</p>
          <p style="background: white">We shall see how this change in
            the conditions of exist­ence rapidly determines the
            manifestation of the phenom­ena of coagulation and then of
            other alterations of the blood.<br>

          <p>The blood is a flowing tissue; Bordeu had already re­marked
            that it was flowing flesh. This chemically, histologically
            and physiologically is far from being true;1 the only thing
            certain is that the blood like the flesh is a tissue, and
            that both of them are spontaneously alterable, as are all
            tissues, when the natural conditions of existence of their
            anatomical elements are no longer realized. For instance, in
            the case of the muscular tissue, cadaveric rigidity follows
            death very quickly, and, in the case of the blood, the
            formation of the clot follows closely upon its issue from
            the vessels.</p>
          <p><i>1. It was, I think, in 1742, in his thesis, entitled
              "Chylificationis historia," maintained, at Montpellier, at
              the age of 20 years, that Bordeu, among the original ideas
              which makes him to be regarded as one of the precursors of
              Bichat, put forth the idea that the blood is flowing
              flesh. In the seventeenth century, Amyot had already said
              that "the blood is engendered by the transmutaiton of some
              flesh which becomes a flowing liquid." (Diet, of Littre.)
              If an original sketch, later recognised as correct, is
              sufficient for the author to be historically regarded as
              the discoverer, assuredly Bordeu would deserve to be
              regarded as having discovered that the blood, like muscle
              flesh, is a tissue. But, as observed by Babinet, "if the
              ancients have said everything, they have demonstrated
              nothing." Bichat also inserted the blood tissue among his
              twenty-one elementary tissues, next to his muscular
              tissues.</i><i><br>
            </i> <i><br>
            </i><i>But since Bichat other savants have so done. In my
              time at Montpellier the Professor of Physiology, M.
              Rouget, taught that the blood, because of its globules, is
              a tissue; and I replied that, according to the ideas then
              accepted, the blood is no more a liquid or a tissue than
              was sweetened water holding in suspension globules of
              yeast.</i><i><br>
            </i> <i><br>
            </i><i>To-day, M. Ranvier also says that the blood is a
              tissue because it contains figured elements like the
              lymph. Doubtless the chief condition necessary for its
              being regarded as a tissue is for a product of an organism
              to contain some figured element, but that is not enough;
              according to the doctrine of Bichat it is also necessary
              to show that this element is living; and still that is
              insufficient; otherwise milk, the saliva, and even the
              urine and certain pathological serosities, spontaneously
              coagulable, would like the lymph and the blood be tissues.
              I will consider this further in the last chapter.</i></p>
          <i> </i>
          <p style="background: white">It is not disputed that the
            phenomenon of the coagulation of the blood is spontaneous;
            the standard facts concerning this phenomenon are as
            follows: The defibrinated blood obtained by whipping does
            not coagulate spontaneously, and the globules remain intact
            in the liquor which has lost its peculiar viscosity.</p>
          <p style="background: white">The blood of oxen and of sheep (I
            leave for the present the blood of the horse), received into
            a glass or metal vessel, seems to coagulate throughout its
            mass, uniformly from the periphery to the center, forming a
            single solid clot which follows the shape of the vessel into
            which it has been received. This clot contracts by degrees,
            up to a certain limit, expelling from it in so doing the
            serum of a lemon color, which thereafter becomes
            red-colored, getting gradually deeper, so that the
            contracted clot (withdrawn from the edges) floats in the
            serum which has been expelled from its primitive mass. As
            Haller has already said, the clot is formed by the network
            of fibres of the fibrin which imprisons the globules in its
            meshes.</p>
          <p style="background: white">It remains to explain these
            phenomena invoking only the chemical, physiological and
            anatomical facts studied in the preceding chapters. The
            necessary condition for the tissue to remain flowing is that
            the properties of the anatom­ical elements and their
            independence remain unchanged; that their relations with the
            intercellular liquor remain con­stant, not only in the
            vessel, but also after the venesection.</p>
          <p style="background: white">We know the distribution of the
            globules in the blood, and how they pass, one by one, into
            certain capillaries; the distribution of the microzymian
            molecular granulations is such that if the globules should
            disappear they will occupy all the space which the globules
            occupied; that is to say, that the former exist in such a
            manner in the blood that the globule; move in it in
            displacing the former unceasingly, but in immediately
            reoccupying the abandoned space; in short they realize the
            conception of Dumas, when he said of the fibrin that it
            exists in a flowing condition in the blood; only that this
            flowing condition is molecular, attached, as we have seen,
            as to each molecular granulation to a microzyma for nucleus,
            forming a limited atmosphere around each, which albuminoid
            atmosphere is absolutely insoluble in the blood serum.</p>
          <p style="background: white">To understand that the number of
            microzymas of the blood is sufficiently large in order that,
            surrounded by the atmosphere which constitutes them
            microzymian molecular granulations, they may occupy every
            point of the blood mass, even that of the globules which
            were driven away, it is sufficient to know that they exist
            there in innumerable quantity. This is proved in the
            following manner: The fibrinous microzymas, that is to say,
            the blood microzymas, are with the pancreatic microzymas,
            the smallest I have observed. They assume, in their extreme
            minuteness, the spherical form. The diameter of these
            microzymas probably does not attain 0.0005mm (mm?) in the
            humid state. This enables us to calculate that in the volume
            of 1 mm. cube there are at least 15 milliards 250 millions.
            Now a litre of sheep's blood furnishes 5.25 grammes of dried
            molecular granulations, which nearly represent the weight of
            the fibrin that the same-blood furnishes by whipping. But
            the fibrin, supposed dried, contains 1/193 of its weight of
            dried microzymas; then 5.25 grammes of molecular
            granulations, likewise dried, contains 5.25/193 = 0.0272
            grammes; that is to say, 27 milligrammes of dried microzymas
            per litre of blood, which represents a very much greater
            weight of humid physio­logical microzymas; but in taking
            this figure for the weight of the microzymas in the
            physiological condition of humidity, and 15 milliards per
            milligrammes or cubic millemetre, it is seen that one litre
            of blood contains more than 27 times 15 milliards of
            microzymas. But their weight is in reality much less than
            this, for, humid, these microzymas can retain 80% of water;
            in the blood, enveloped with an albuminoid atmosphere
            saturated with the intercellular liquor, they certainly
            retain less, but in a manner to render legitimate the
            approximate calculations above given.</p>
          <p style="background: white">It will be interesting to learn
            the thickness of the albuminoid atmosphere which surrounds
            each microzyma to constitute the microzymian molecular
            granulation, such as it exists in the blood at the moment of
            venesection. An approximate idea of this can be obtained by
            considering that the volume of the spherical molecular
            granulations with a condensed atmosphere of the deposit
            formed in the blood which has had added to it twice its
            volume of alcohol at 35-40 degrees is about 50 cubic
            centimetres per 1000 c.c. of blood; making allowance for the
            space occupied by the globules, we may consider that the
            volume of the molecular granulations, before the
            condensation of their atmosphere, was about twenty times
            greater to occupy the entire space of the 1,000 c.c. of
            blood; it will be presently proven that they do in reality
            occupy it all. The albuminoid atmosphere being thus swollen
            and saturated with the intercellular liquor, it can be
            understood that the great number of milliards of these
            molecular granulations arc sufficient to occupy the entire
            space presented by the blood, provided that their density be
            very little greater, if not equal, to that of the
            intercellular liquor which isolates them from one another.
            This state of the microzymian molecular granulations
            explains the sort of viscosity which belongs to the blood,
            and how the globules, whose density is greater, move about
            in it without being deposited and are only deposited very
            slowly in the ox's or sheep's blood when at rest; and we
            shall see how the exception presented by the blood of the
            horse confirms these considerations.</p>
          <p style="background: white">We have now to inquire whether,
            after the shedding the blood, the conditions, which I have
            mentioned as necessary for the blood tissue to remain
            flowing, can still be realized.</p>
          <p style="background: white">And first it is evident that this
            tissue, bearing in mind that we are considering a mixture
            outside of the vessels, longer in its natural physiological
            situation.</p>
          <p style="background: white">In this new situation the
            intercellular liquor, in which are united all the soluble
            organic and mineral products of the denutrition of the
            anatomical elements of the containers and of the contents,
            immediately changes its composition; for the disassimilated
            products, which have become non-usable, are no longer
            eliminated, and the usable can no longer be utilized or
            renewed; further, the anatomical elements of the flowing
            tissue, which have imperative need of oxygen to function
            properly, are more and more deprived of it; for, after
            having consumed all that was held in reset the flowing
            tissue and which the uneliminated products, thus
            accumulating in it, had been able to absorb, the oxygen thus
            consumed is not renewed by respiration. The first change
            then which happens in the shed-blood is that which the
            intercellular liquor necessarily undergoes in its
            composition.</p>
          <p style="background: white">The microzymian molecular
            granulations are first anatomical elements to be affected by
            this change of medium and of conditions of existence, and,
            we have seen, this impression is so intense and at the same
            time so rapid that it manifests itself in a few seconds by
            the profound change which occurs in the albuminoid substance
            of their atmosphere which, from being as it was immediately
            soluble in very dilute hydrochloric acid, becomes insoluble
            in it, dissolving in it, only as a function of time and
            temperature, while being transformed. It follows that this
            influence has the effect of coagulating this substance
            relatively will dilute hydrochloric acid.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Section37">
          <p style="background: white">That settled, the mechanism of
            the formation of the clot is as follows:</p>
          <p style="background: white">The microzymian molecular
            granulations exist throughout the whole of the space
            occupied by the flowing tissue, excepting that which is
            occupied by the globules and the intercellular and
            intergranular liquor. Thanks to their density, though very
            little greater than that of the intergranular liquor, they
            approach one another and come into contact when at rest;
            their albuminoid atmospheres, soft and mucous, mingle
            together, while at the same time their substance undergoes
            the coagulation of which I spoke. And these changes are so
            rapid that the globules, although much superior in density,
            have not the time to be precipitated and are caught in the
            meshes of the network formed by the sol­dering of the
            albuminoid atmosphere which constitutes the fibrin and
            membranes, as already said by Haller.</p>
          <p style="background: white">Both the molecular granulations
            and the globules are so closely connected by capillarity to
            the intercellular liquor that at the time when, or some
            minutes afterwards, the clot is completely formed, or, as it
            is said, the coagulation is complete, the vessel containing
            it can be turned upside down without any trace of the liquid
            escaping. This, in fact, is what is to be expected from what
            I have said about the distribution of the molecular
            granulations in the flowing tissue and of that of the
            intercellular liquor around the three anatomical elements.</p>
          <p style="background: white">It is true that it might be
            maintained, with some appear­ance of reason, "but that is
            precisely what happens in the plasmatic hypothesis." But
            that hypothesis has never been verified; on the contrary, I
            have directly proved that plasma does not exist in the
            blood, but that the existence of molecular granulations with
            their central microzymas was certain, as was also that of
            the microzymas in the fibrin obtained by whipping. But the
            following are two phenomena which the hypothesis of the
            plasma cannot explain.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Section39">
          <p style="background: white">The coagulation being complete,
            by degrees the clot divides itself spontaneously into two
            parts. That which, in the clot, encloses the globules; that
            is to say, the network of fibrin formed by the soldering of
            the microzymian molecular granulations, contracts then more
            and more, up to a certain limit, preserving the shape of the
            vessel in which the clot is moulded, and while the
            retraction takes place a part of the intercellular liquor is
            expelled, constituting what is called the serum, in which
            the retracted tissue is now immersed.</p>
          <p style="background: white">And the first serum thus expelled
            is transparent and lemon colored, but by degrees the oxygen
            which the intercellular liquor holds dissolved, as well as
            that which the globules contain, is consumed; then is
            manifested the phenomenon observed and explained by J. B.
            Dumas in globules deprived of oxygen; they change, and their
            changed coloring matter is diffused in the circumambient
            serum which becomes more and more of a deep red color. This
            is what the plasmatic hypothesis cannot explain, if one
            regards the plasma as a liquid in which all the components
            are in perfect solution. Let us now give a more direct
            demonstra­tion of this fact.</p>
          <p style="background: white">All other things being equal, the
            rapidity of the coagulation of the blood may vary notably
            from one species to another. The blood of the horse, under
            the same conditions as that of the ox and of the sheep, is
            well fitted to verify the truth of the role ascribed to the
            third anatomical element of the flowing tissue. It is known
            that the (shed) blood of the horse is divided by rest into
            two layers: the lower, called cruor, is formed by the
            globules; the upper, called liquor, contains the microzymian
            molecular granulations. The upper layer, transparent but not
            limpid, flowing, possessing the peculiar viscosity, can even
            be decanted after the globules are precip­itated and very
            quickly forms a clot in all its mass, in such wise, that the
            containing vessel maybe turned up-side down without one drop
            of the liquor escaping; after which the retraction, with
            loss of transparency, is produced and the serum commences to
            be progressively expressed from it, as in the case of the
            bloods whose globules do not separate. Now this retraction
            would not be produced if dealing with a substance really
            dissolved which, in coagulating, should become insoluble in
            the same medium.1</p>
          <p style="background: white"><i>1. The coagulation of the
              blood has been compared to the gelatinization of a
              solution of gelatine (Frey. Traite d'histologie et
              d'histochimie. p. 141). but a solution of pure gelatine
              heated in distilled water and sufficiently concentrated
              can be obtained absolutely limpid by careful filtration.
              On cooling this solution forms a jelly, more or less
              consistent, perfectly limpid, not undergoing any other
              contraction than that produced by the lowering of the
              temperature. Nevertheless, in fact the gelatine has
              coagulated, for in the gelatinized solution it has become
              insoluble in cold water as it was before. But the
              comparison made by Dumas with the state of fecula in
              starch is more correct. In fact in the transparent starch
              the fecula is not dissolved, it cannot be filtered. By
              cooling, after a long time, the starch undergoes a change
              in its appearance; it becomes more opaque and a retraction
              accompanied by expulsion of liquid can be observed. This
              happens because the fecula was not dissolved, but simply
              enormously distended.</i></p>
          <i> </i>
          <p style="background: white">The peculiarity presented by the
            blood of the horse may be due to the greater difference
            between the density of its globules and that of the
            intercellular liquor, and at the same time to a greater
            softness of the albuminoid atmosphere of the microzymian
            molecular granulations, which will be more swollen, and,
            consequently, their mass surrounded by the serum more
            readily traversed by the globules. I have, therefore,
            compared, as being the only thing accessible for
            experimentation, the serums of blood of the ox and of the
            sheep, with that of the blood of the horse, with regard to
            their general composition.</p>

            100.C</p>
          <p style="background: white">The most striking thing, above
            all, is not alone that the serum of the blood of the horse
            contains less fixed materials, organic and mineral, with a
            rotatory power very nearly equal to that of the blood of the
            ox and much lower than that of sheep's blood, but especially
            that it contains between seven and eight times less mineral
            matters than either of the other two.</p>
          <p style="background: white">The serum of the blood of the
            horse differs then prodigiously from the two serums to which
            I had compared it; this amply explains at once the softness
            of the albuminoid atmosphere of the granulations and the
            rapid deposit of the globules.</p>
          <p style="background: white">Experiment thus verifies the fact
            that the molecular granulations occupy in the blood not only
            all the space occupied by the globules, but also all the
            space left free by their precipitation.</p>
          <p style="background: white">According to Charles Robin1
            agreeing with many authors, the blood of man, and that of
            the dog and of the ox, behave like that of the horse, when
            they are cooled down a little below freezing; they remain
            liquid a sufficiently long time to enable the globules to be
            deposited, the leukocytes, according to Donne, forming a
            grayish layer upon the top of the blood globules; the
            supernatant liquid then forms the clot, losing its
            transparency when the temperature reaches 12° to 14°
            C.(=53°.6 to57°.2,F.), and it should be added that Ch.
            Robin, having observed the transparency of the supernatant
            layer separate from the globules under these circumstances,
            and which he called plasma, stated that it could not be
            filtered.</p>
          <p style="background: white"><i>1. Ch. Robin, Lecons surles
              Humeurs. p. 59 (1871).</i></p>
          <i> </i>
          <p style="background: white">I regret that I had not had the
            time to verify these experiments, but the facts may well be
            regarded as true, being certified by Ch. Robin. They support
            the theory which I lay down; the lowering of the temperature
            below zero (32° F.) having the effect of singularly
            retarding the functions of nutrition of the anatomical
            elements (as it retarded those of beeryeast) ought to retard
            the coagulation of the albuminoid atmosphere of the
            microzymian molecular granulations.</p>
          <p style="background: white">The formation of the classical
            fibrin by whipping remains to be explained, and this is now
            very easy. It is the result of a simultaneous mechanical and
            chemical action. By the mechanical action the layer of
            intercellular liquor which separates the molecular
            granulations is broken, while the granulations forcibly set
            free are united by their mucous albuminoid atmosphere, at
            the same time that the changes in the conditions of
            existence determine the allotropic transformation of the
            albuminoid substance which, coagulated as we have seen,
            contracts at the same time, still enveloping the microzymas;
            in consequence of which that which was diffused throughout
            all the volume of the blood is reduced to relatively small
            volume occupied by the classical fibrin. And by the small
            volume of the fibrin obtained by whipping a judgment may be
            formed of the enormous volume formed by the albuminoid
            atmosphere which surrounded the granulations of the flowing
            tissue at the moment of the venesec­tion, as we have
            observed also in relation to the molecular granulations when
            separated from the alcoholized blood.</p>
          <p style="background: white">In the separation of fibrin by
            whipping the globules remain entire, and I have explained
            that if the weight of the fibrin thus produced is less than
            that of fibrin obtained by washing the contracted clot, it
            is because to the free molecular granulations of the blood
            are added those obtained by the destruction of the globules
            with their envelopes.</p>
          <p style="background: white">Such were the facts upon which
            rested the experimental physiological theory of the
            spontaneous coagulation of the blood, when, in 1895, I
            communicated them to the Bordeaux Congress of the French
            Association for the advancement of science.</p>
          <p style="background: white">If there remained any doubt as to
            the value of the theory concerning the spontaneous
            coagulation of the blood as a flowing tissue, here is what
            must remove them. The new experiments to which they relate
            are the fruit of the following considerations:</p>
          <p style="background: white">If the formation of the clot is
            actually the result of the spontaneous soldering of the
            mucous albuminoid atmospheres of the microzymian molecular
            granulations; if in the presence of alcohol, diluted to a
            suitable degree, these atmospheres are condensed, the
            molecular granulations remaining independent of one another,
            what would happen if instead of alcohol the blood should be
            received into water? The following is the experimental
            answer:</p>
          <p style="background: white"> Coagulation of blood diffused in
            water. At the moment of venesection the blood is received
            into increasing volumes of distilled water up to half of its
            volume. The clot is formed in all cases; with small
            quantities the globules do not appear to be altered and the
            first serum has its ordinary appearance, but in proportion
            as the quantity of water is increased there arrives a time
            when the serum becomes colored. Encouraged by these trials,
            one day in November, at Paris, the blood of the general
            venesection of a Russian sheep was received, as to one part
            into two volumes of alcohol at 36°, carbolated with two
            drops per hundred c.c., and as to the other part into two
            volumes of distilled water carbolized in the same
            proportion.</p>
          <p style="background: white">The alcoholized mixture yielded
            the ordinary deposit of microzymian molecular granulations
            with the properties with which we are now familiar and
            naturally there was no trace of a clot.</p>
          <p style="background: white">The aqueous mixture furnished
            something very different from a precipitate. Like the
            alcoholic mixture, the aqueous mixture had been made at 9
            o'clock in the morning; naturally, like the other, it was of
            a deep red color, since under such conditions all the
            haemoglobin of the blood globules had become dissolved. But
            at 3 p.m. the aqueous mixture was coagulated, the clot
            occupying the entire volume of the mixture, a volume three
            times greater than the blood clot without the addition of
            water. A little deep red liquid was already expelled; the
            next day the blood clot was not more contracted.</p>
          <p style="background: white">The experiment repeated with ox
            blood gave the same results; the blood clot was formed in
            the entire mass, floating in a little deep red liquid, etc.</p>
          <p style="background: white">The trembling and nearly
            transparent clots of the two experiments were placed to
            drain on a moist cloth of close texture. At a given moment
            the cloths were found covered with a mucous substance which,
            a prolonged washing, with water slightly carbolized (1 drop
            per 100 c.c.), then with alcohol at 25%, and again with
            water, did not completely decolor; at the end there remained
            a red false membrane which could be removed in a single
            piece from the damp cloth; such was the appearance and state
            of the fibrin of the clot formed under these conditions; its
            quantity is percept­ibly that which is isolated by the
            washing of the ordinary clot. In this condition this fibrin
            is not dissolved immediately in hydrochloric acid at 2/1000,
            but like ordinary fibrin is a function of time and of
            temperature, and without first taking on the condition of a
            jelly like the fibrin from whipping, etc.</p>
          <p style="background: white">If then the albuminoid atmosphere
            of the hematic microzymian molecular granulations is
            condensed under the influence of alcohol of proper strength,
            the same atmos­phere is much more distended, three times
            more, in water, and the blood still coagulates in all its
            mass, the globules being destroyed.</p>
          <p style="background: white">The conclusion which results from
            this new series of experiments is that the physiological
            theory of the spontaneous coagulation of the blood, founded
            on the existence of a third anatomical element, the
            microzymian molecular granulations of the flowing tissue,
            sufficiently explains the facts.</p>
          <p style="background: white">It is time then to erase from the
            language of science the words plasma, plasmine, fibrinogen
            and of fibrinoplastic, with which it has been encumbered.a
            There must also be erased for the explanation of the
            phenomenon the pretended influence of the globules, of
            calcareous or other salts, catalytic actions of contact,
            etc., not to speak of various occult</p>
          <p style="background: white"><i>[a. Term microbe must also be
              erased; unless it be desired to retain it to denote

          <p style="background: white">influences. An exact knowledge of
            the anatomy of the blood and of the conditions of existence
            of the anatomical elements will suffice.1 But it is also
            necessary to understand in another way than has heretofore
            been done the meaning of what is called the coagulation of
            the blood. In truth, the blood does not coagulate. The
            experiment proves it; it is the substance of the atmosphere
            of the third anatomical element of the flowing tissue which,
            in undergoing the allotropic change of coagulation, gives to
            the aggregate of the phenomenon the appearance of a total
            coagulation; but, as we have seen, it is only an illusion.</p>
          <p style="background: white"><i>1.&nbsp; It is because the
              conditions of existence of the anatomical elements are
              longer realized when the blood is preserved between two
              ligatures in the vessel which contains it that the
              coagulation of the flowing tissue is often long defer red.
              This explains the success of certain experiments of
              authors and, the most recent, those of M. Fr. Glenard
              (1875). (Thesis above quoted.)</i></p>
          <i> </i>
          <p style="background: white">The supposed spontaneous
            coagulation of the blood is at bottom, only the end of the
            first phase of the spontaneous alteration of the flowing
            tissue, as the cadaveric rigidity, marks the first phase of
            the spontaneous alteration of the muscular tissue.</p>
          <p style="background: white">But, what is it that changes in a
            tissue? And what is the second phase of the spontaneous
            alteration of the blood and at what moment does it begin?</p>
          <p style="background: white">It is of importance to the plan
            of this chapter to give a precise answer to these questions.</p>
          <p style="background: white"> Second phase of the spontaneous
            alteration of the blood.</p>
          <p style="background: white">The first begins by the chemical
            alteration of coagulation of the albuminoid atmosphere of
            the microzymian molecular granulation, whence results the
            formation of the clot, the retraction of the latter and the
            expulsion of the lemon-colored serum. The globules have
            nothing to do with this phenomenon, as is incontestably
            proven by the experiment with the blood of the horse.</p>
          <p style="background: white">The second phase begins at the
            moment when the serum becomes colored with red, which shows
            that the change of the blood globules has commenced, their
            haemaglobin, more or less changed, being diffused in the
            serum.&nbsp; The following experiment of M. Pasteur has
            shown what becomes of the globules in this change. This
            savant made it in 1863,1 five years after my verification of
            the hypothesis of germs in the air, when he had given up
            belief in the spontaneous generation of ferments, with the
            object of demonstrating that in the absence of germs the
            blood would not putrify because nothing living would appear
            in it. To understand this it is to be remembered that M.
            Pasteur was a protoplasmist seeing in an organism only
            proximate principles, admitting in it nothing figured,
            autonomically living, comparable to the figured ferments.</p>
          <p style="background: white">I take the recital of the
            experiment from a book of the author, published long after
            the microzymas had been discovered and the microzymian
            theory of the organization completed.</p>
          <p style="background: white">He commences as follows: "Let us
            examine into the interior of living beings, in good health,
            such or such of the materials which may be found there, and
            examine them in the state in which life has formed them, in
            contact with pure air."2</p>

          <p style="background: white">In fact, with the assistance of
            Cl. Barnard, he poured the blood of a dog directly into a
            vessel, the air in which had been calcined. The receiver,
            sealed with the blow-pipe, contained thus one of the
            materials to be examined, obtained from the interior of the
            animal, and thus protected from the germs of the air. I now
            quote textually as follows what M. Fasten thought he
            observed:</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Section1">
          <p style="background: white">1.&nbsp; The blood does not
            putrify, even at the highest temperature of the atmosphere;
            its odor remains that of fresh blood, or takes on that of
            lye.</p>
          <p style="background: white">2.&nbsp; After an exposure of the
            flasks to 25°-30° C. (= 77° to 86° F.), during several
            weeks, nothing can be observed but an absorption of 2% to 3%
            of oxygen, which is replaced by a perceptibly equal volume
            of carbonic acid.</p>
          <p style="background: white">3.&nbsp; Under the circumstances
            in which the blood of the dog, exposed to the contact of
            pure air, does not putrify at all, blood crystals are formed
            with remarkable readiness.</p>
          <p style="background: white">4. In the first days of its being
            placed in the oven, slowly, at the ordinary temperature, the
            serum became gradully colored a deep brown.</p>
          <p style="background: white">5.&nbsp; In proportion as this
            effect is produced the blood globules disappear and the
            serum and the clot become filled with crystals of a brown or
            red color. After some weeks not a single blood globule
            remains either in the serum or in the clot. After a longer
            interval the whole of the fibrin may become collected in a
            single hyaline mass.1</p>

          <i> </i>
          <p style="background: white">Such was the experiment from
            which M. Pasteur concluded that, if protected from germs of
            the air, blood did not putrify at all; that is to say, was
            not altered by the action of any figured ferment, which in
            his opinion only the germs of the air could produce. I have
            elsewhere shown that, supposing the technique of the
            experiment to have been accurately carried out, the
            observations made thereon were incomplete, and the
            interpretation of the results vicious in the extreme. I will
            revert to this hereafter; for the present I will only show
            that the facts of the experiment corroborate my own.</p>
          <p style="background: white">It is evident that, taken
            altogether, the experiment of M. Pasteur has confirmed that
            which the microzymian theory never fails to prove, namely,
            that every tissue, every humor, withdrawn from a living
            healthy animal, absolutely protected from the germs of the
            air, necessarily alters and, consequently, alters
            spontaneously.</p>
          <p style="background: white">It demonstrates further that
            there are two distinct phases in the changes of the blood.</p>
          <p style="background: white">It is true that M. Pasteur did
            not stop an instant to consider the phenomenon of
            coagulation, but he observed that the serum, at first
            lemon-colored, became by degrees red, then deep brown,
            without insisting on the mechanism of the contraction of the
            clot and the expulsion and tardy coloration of the serum
            which marks the commencement of the second phase and which
            follows so exactly the consumption of oxygen which the blood
            contained, that the author himself testified to the
            absorption of a small quantity of the oxygen in his flasks
            with a corresponding production of carbonic acid. During the
            second phase, in which the haemoglobin alters more and more,
            blood crystals are formed, at last the glob­ules are
            destroyed and disappear while the fibrin which imprisoned
            them in the network formed by it contracted more and more.</p>
          <p style="background: white">This picture shows clearly that
            during the two phases the alteration is at once chemical and
            anatomical, ending in the destruction and total
            disappearance of the globules.</p>
          <p style="background: white">But to what cause did M. Pasteur
            ascribe such prodigious effects? In 1863 he also
            experimented on muscle flesh, imitating my method of
            investigation, replacing creosote by alcohol. He wrapped up
            a voluminous mass of flesh in a linen, soaked in alcohol,
            and left it to itself.</p>
          <p style="background: white">"There will not be any
            putrefaction, he said, not in the interior, because the
            germs of the vibrios are absent, nor externally because the
            vapors of alcohol hinder the development of the germs on the
            surface." Nevertheless the author certified that the meat
            "became gamey in a pronounced manner." And why did it become
            gamey? Simply, said he, "because it is impossible at
            ordinary temperature to withdraw the interior of this flesh
            from the reaction of solids and liquids upon one another . .
            . There will necessarily always be what are called actions
            of contact, which develop in the flesh small quantities of
            new substances, which add to the savor of the meat their own
            savor."1</p>
          <p style="background: white">Then at ordinary temperatures the
            same thing should happen with the blood as with the muscle
            tissues; there will be actions of contact, reactions of the
            solids upon the liquids; and that is why the blood changes
            without putrifying as flesh becomes gamey without
            putrefaction. There is some excuse for M. Pasteur and the
            academies with him to have been satisfied with these
            explanations, seeing that protoplasmism had been accepted as
            a dogma among savants. It was faith in this doctrine which
            caused the globule to be regarded as an organite, and the
            mass of the blood or of the flesh, for a collection of
            proximate principles, and, which is more ser­ious, hindered
            M. Pasteur from seeing the microzymas among the results of
            his experiment, or, if he saw them, caused him to neglect
            them, as he had neglected the micro­zymas and even the
            vibrios in the gamey meat. However it maybe, it was by
            invoking actions of contact, and of reactions of solids and
            liquids, that M. Pasteur persuaded himself that the
            alterations of the blood and those of the flesh were not
            phenomena of putrefaction; that is to say, of fermentation.
            And this manner of regarding things on the part of the
            cele­brated savant prevailed so generally that I was obliged
            to make an explanation on the subject of an assertion made
            by Balardin 1874.</p>
          <p style="background: white">M. Servel, Estor's assistant, had
            presented to the Academy2 a work verifying the fact that
            with absolute protection from atmospheric germs the most
            divers tissues could</p>

            Now, Balard, who presented the work, took the occasion to
            say that blood is preserved without putrid fermentation and
            without bacteria in the experiment of M. Pasteur.1 I replied
            to M. Balard, saying that the blood is one of these
            substances, of which the egg is another, whereof the
            microzymas undergo with most difficulty the vibrionian
            evolution.2 In spite of this the experiment of M. Pasteur
            was given as a pre-emptory demonstration that the interior
            medium contains nothing figured which could become bacterium
            by evolution in the substance of a tissue or of a humor; and
            it was asserted, in agreement with him, that the experiment
            proved at the same time that the bodies of animals were
            closed to germs from without.</p>

          <i> </i>
          <p style="background: white">Nevertheless, in a discussion at
            the Academy of Medicine, where, once more, I defended the
            microzymian theory, M. Pasteur took part in the discussion,
            maintaining his former conclusions, continuing even to deny
            the exist­ence of the microzymas. It was then that I urged
            against him his own experiment upon the blood which is a
            demonstration against his own system. I said: "Do you affirm
            that the blood in which crystals are formed and the globules
            disappear is not altered? The globules of this blood are
            always destroyed and disappear: what then has destroyed
            them? Even the haemoglobin is transformed into crystals and
            we find in the liquid a swarm of microzymas . . . these
            microzymas which you have neither seen nor noticed."</p>
          <p style="background: white">No longer invoking actions of
            contact, M. Pasteur said: "But these transformations are
            made under the influence of the oxygen of the air." With
            regard to the presence of the microzymas he admitted it in
            leaving it to be believed that I had stated that they became
            bacteria in his experiment.1</p>
          <p style="background: white"><i>1.Bulletin de l'Academic de
              medecine, 2d series, Vol. XV. p. 679.</i></p>
          <i> </i>
          <p style="background: white">The presence then of the
            microzymas being acknowledged, the observation of the
            results of the experiment was completed, it matters little
            after that, that M. Pasteur continued to treat them as
            "creatures of the imagination," and that he explained the
            phenomena as the result of some influence of oxygen; I had
            reason to hope that this avowal would open the eyes of my
            academical opponents and that they would acknowledge that
            they had been deceived. But nothing of the kind; the
            acknowledgment exists nevertheless, and it only remains to
            prove that they are really the agents of the changes of the
            second phase of the phenomenon and of the destruction of the
            globules.</p>
          <p style="background: white">In the first chapter we have
            shown that fibrin left to itself covered by carbolized
            water, open even to contact with the air, is transformed
            into soluble products without the appearance of bacteria,
            leaving a residue of new microzymian molecular granulations
            without phenomena of fetid putrefaction; and we have also
            seen that the microzymas of these granulations were the
            ferments of the transform­ations. On the other hand we have
            also seen, that in fecula starch, the same fibrin liquefies
            this starch and makes it ferment, while its microzymas
            become bacteria; we have there two examples, in one of which
            the microzymas are active without evolution, in the other
            they undergo bacterian evolution.</p>
          <p style="background: white"> The following experiment
            demonstrates that oxygen has no influence in the phenomenon
            of the destruction of the globules in defibrinated blood.</p>
          <p style="background: white">About 300 c.c. of the blood of
            the ox, having added to it 50 c.c. of a saturated aqueous
            solution of phenol, were immediately defibrinated and the
            blood carefully separated from the fibrin submitted to a
            current of carbonic acid, for the purpose of expelling the
            oxygen. The flask was closed and left to itself at the
            temperature of the month of June in Montpellier during one
            month, and afterwards in the oven at 30° to 33° C. (= 86° to
            91°.4 F.); this blood did not undergo fetid putrefaction,
            the globules, very slightly altered in shape, remained whole
            during the first ten or twelve days. It was only about the
            15th of June that there appeared a great quantity of very
            fine molecular granulations, of which only some rare
            examples had before appeared, without any trace of vibrios
            or of bacteria. The globules resisted for a long time
            further, and ended by disappearing. Here was an alteration
            without the presence of oxygen, whereof the microzymas could
            not be other than those of the globules.</p>
          <p style="background: white">The fibrin and the globules of
            defibrinated blood can then be destroyed by their own
            microzymas alone, without fetid putrefaction and without
            bacteria.</p>
          <p style="background: white">If in the experiment with the
            blood of the ox, defibrinated or not, no blood crystals were
            formed it was because the haemoglobin of this blood is one
            of those which either do not yield them at all or do so with
            difficulty.1</p>
          <p style="background: white"><i>1 As to the assertion of M.
              Pasteur relative to the influence of the oxygen of the
              air, he knew that a long lime before I had refuted this in
              advance (see Les Microzymas, p. 253. and following
              (1883),Chamalet, 60, Passage de Choiseul): it is there
              shown that the blood taken from the crural artery of a
              dog, with the addition of a little of the saturated
              solution of creosote, submitted to a continuous current of
              common air is preserved arterialized and the globules
              remain perfect a long lime; these last, however, end by
              being destroyed so that the microzymas become free, often
              without the appearance of bacteria, and always without
              felid putrefaction. When the current of air is replaced by
              pure oxygen the same thing happens and the crystals of
              blood are formed at between 24° to 26° C. of temperature.
              It is on the contrary, in carbonic acid, that the blood
              globules of the dog are destroyed most quickly and the
              crystals are formed most readily between 35 to 40 C,
              always without fetid putrefaction.</i><i><br>
            </i><i> <br>
              Later I showed that under :he same conditions as that of
              the blood of the dog, the bloods of the ox. of the pig, of
              the fowl, of the duck give neither crystals nor yet the
              soluble haemoglobin of the ox. Bulletin of the Academy of
              Medicine, 2d Series. Vol. XVII. p. 225 (1887).</i><i><br>
            </i><i> <br>
              I will add that under the prolonged action of the current
              of air on the blood of the dog I have found that the
              quantity of normal urea was increased. This statement
              should be verified.</i></p>
          <i> </i>
          <p style="background: white">Assuredly, if in spite of the
            changes certified to by himself, M. Pasteur came to the
            conclusion that muscle, flesh and blood were not liable to
            become putrid, it must have been because he firmly believed
            that ferments had for their only source the germs of the air
            and that the protoplasmic system of organization was founded
            on rigorous observation. And I venture to say that he knew
            he was in error and that, later, it was with design that he
            disputed the microzymian theory, being unwilling to confess
            that he had observed badly and had taken the wrong road.</p>
          <p style="background: white">Prof. Joseph Bechamp reviewed the
            experiment on flesh as I had done for that of the blood. He
            repeated the experiment of M. Pasteur without using alcohol
            as an antiseptic, and in the centre of the piece of meat,
            there where M. Pasteur said that the germs of vibrios were
            absent, he found the microzymas in evolution and vibrios or
            bacteria. At the same time he found the tissue
            disorganizing.1</p>
          <p style="background: white"><i>1. C.R. Vol LXXXIX, p. 573.</i></p>
          <i> </i>
          <p style="background: white">When I had led M. Pasteur to
            acknowledge the presence of the microzymas in the altered
            blood, I was anxious to make him confess the presence of
            bacteria in the interior of the gamey mass of flesh in his
            other experiments. But he refused, saying: "I do not know
            what you mean in speaking of one of my experiments on
            flesh."</p>
          <p style="background: white">The excessive role ascribed to
            the germs of the air by this savant and his pretended
            demonstration of the imputrescibility of organic matters in
            general when protected from the germs of the air, have
            diverted science into a deplorable road. He thus threw doubt
            upon a truth long since acquired; namely, that all natural
            organic matters, vegetable and animal, are liable to
            spontaneous change by a phenomenon of fermentation under the
            conditions specified by Macquer.</p>
          <p style="background: white">This truth must be re-established
            if we would understand the real meaning of the experiment of
            M. Pasteur upon the blood; to do this we must connect it
            with the introductory matter which precedes the first
            chapter of this work, which led up to the discovery of the
            real nature of fibrin, which was 11 ic point of departure
            for the discovery of the real nature of the blood.</p>
          <p style="background: white">I call to mind then that I proved
            how a solution of sugar or of any other proximate principle,
            or their mixtures, were changeable on contact with the air,
            owing to the ferments horn of the germs of this air. M.
            Pasteur, who had previously asserted the spontaneous
            generation of ferments, repeated my experiments and was
            convinced. Then he generalized and asserted that it would be
            the same in the case of urine and of milk, resembling in
            this sweetened yeast broth which, being boiled, was not
            altered if creosoted or left to itself in calcined air.</p>
          <p style="background: white">Before the experiment on the
            blood or on the flesh, this celebrated savant had
            experimented on urine and on milk. As to fresh milk, he
            admitted, a priori, that it soured owing to ferments born of
            the germs of the air, and that it was coagulated by the
            lactic acid which coagulated its casein. But here we have
            boiled milk coagulating in calcined air without becoming
            sour, while vibrios appeared in it. He was surprised at
            this, but did not in anywise seek to fathom the mystery,
            maintaining that in milk the germs of the air resist heating
            to 100 ° C. and become vibrios, to which he ascribed the
            coagulation.1</p>
          <p style="background: white"><i>1. His Memoir should be read
              (Ann. de Chimie et de Physique, Vol. LXIV, pp. 58-63) to
              realize the efforts made by M. Pasteur to convince himself
              that the germs of the air are the sole origin of the
              vibrios.</i></p>
          <i> </i>
          <p style="background: white">I have narrated, in the
            introduction, how I applied the new method of research to
            milk and thence to various other tissues; similarly I
            studied from the point of view of their chemical and
            anatomical changes urine, birds' eggs, fruits which become
            over-ripe, sprouted barley, frozen plants after a thaw and
            globules of beer yeast, etc.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Section9">
          <p style="background: white">Now for the chemical and
            anatomical facts regarding milk, upon which I cannot insist
            too strongly. The first phase of its alteration is the
            separation of the milk globules in the cream; this
            separation corresponds in an inverse sense to the separation
            of the blood globules in the cruor of the blood of the
            horse; the second phase is the souring which precedes the
            formation of the clot; and this souring corresponds to a
            fermentation which produces alcohol, acetic acid and lactic
            acid, the agents whereof are solely the microzymas proper to
            the milk, for at the moment when the clot is formed, whether
            the milk has been creosoted or not, the microscope discloses
            only these microzymas, which have become more readily
            visible. The vibrios or bacteria which then appear mark the
            anatomical phase of the phenomenon. But for the complete
            understanding of the phenomenon of the alterations which
            occur in milk, it is necessary, as in the case of the blood,
            to recognize that after its issue from the gland its
            anatomical elements are no longer in their normal conditions
            of existence. Also perfectly fresh milk does not contain
            lactic acid-contrary to the opinion of Berzelius — but it
            contains alcohol and acetic acid; it hence results that the
            production of lactic acid after the milking indicates a
            functional change in the microzymas of the milk; and this
            formation of lactic acid taking place without the
            disengagement of gas, especially of hydrogen, indicates in
            addition that the microzymas of the milk are different from
            those of the blood.</p>
          <p style="background: white">And since it relates to the
            phenomenon of coagulation, and that the clot of milk has
            been compared to the clot of blood, it must also be
            recognized that the milk clot is not the coagulation of the
            casein by lactic acid. The casein, in fact, is an insoluble
            albuminoid proximate principle, which exists in the milk in
            the state of a soluble caseinate; the acids, whether it be
            the lactic or the acetic acid, saturate the alkali and the
            casein is precipitated; it results from this that that
            .which is called coagulation of the casein in the milk,
            which is spontaneously altered, is the slow precipitation of
            the casein by the acids which render the milk sour.</p>
          <p style="background: white">With regard to the coagulation of
            boiled milk, where there is no souring, that is a phenomenon
            of another kind in which the caseinates, the albuminates and
            the zymas of the milk modified by the heat take part; it is
            a zymastic action, which may be likened to coagulation by
            rennet, the zymas whereof has its origin in some functional
            modification by heat of the microzymas of the milk. And this
            functional modification of these microzymas is so certain
            that, if there be added to the milk quantities of creosote
            or of carbolic acid sufficiently great to prevent the
            vibrionian evolution of the microzymas, there will be no
            souring or coagulation of the milk; the albuminoid matters
            undergo other transformations and at last, if the action
            continues for a long time, at 30° to 35 ° C., the milk
            globules are destroyed, the fatty bodies which they contain
            being set free.</p>
          <p style="background: white">The preceding facts regard
            especially the milks of the cow and of the goat, which are
            casein milk.</p>
          <p style="background: white">The milks of the ass and of women
            do not contain casein, but they sour spontaneously without
            coagulating and yield no clot on the addition of rennet.1</p>
          <p style="background: white">Normal human urine, creosoted,
            ferments without disengaging gas, producing alcohol, acetic
            acid and benzoic acid proceeding from hyppuric acid, while
            the epithelial cellules are destroyed and the microzymas
            evolute.2</p>

          <p style="background: white">The liver, plunged in carbolized
            water, produces, with the disengagement of carbonic acid,
            hydrogen and sulphuretted hydrogen, alcohol, acetic acid,
            lactic acid, while its cellules are destroyed and its
            microzymas evolve and become bacteria.1</p>
          <p style="background: white">But the changes of eggs and of
            beer yeast are specially conclusive. The egg of the bird is
            an organism whose function is to produce a bird. Donne, by
            vigorous jolting, destroyed this organism, mixing, in the
            shell, the yolk with the white and thus produced a kind of
            alteration which I studied. The egg of an ostrich thus
            treated, at a temperature of 30°-35° C. (86°-95° F.),
            fermented and produced so much gas that the internal
            pressure became sufficiently strong to throw out a small
            part of the contents, on a hole being made in the shell. The
            gases set free were carbonic acid, hydrogen and a trace of
            sulphuretted hydrogen. When the gaseous disengagement ceased
            there was no longer any sulphuretted hydrogen. All the
            vitellin globules had disappeared and the microzymas were
            preserved with their form, without any trace of vibrios or
            other organized production. All the glucose of the egg had
            disappeared while the albuminoid matter had been preserved,
            the soluble being coagulable by heat. The products of
            fermentation were alcohol, acetic acid and butyric acid,
            showing that they had been produced from the lactate. Here
            then was a fermentation strictly defined, where­in the
            microzymas, like those of the blood, did not undergo
            vibrionian evolution.2 In order that the vitellin microzymas
            may evolve other conditions are necessary.</p>

          <i> </i>
          <p style="background: white">The case of beer yeast is still
            more interesting, for it has to do with a living being
            reduced to a cellule, whose alteration and total destruction
            will throw a strong light upon those of the blood globule.
            Suppose an alcoholic fermentation of cane sugar for which a
            little more yeast had been employed than was needed for the
            complete fermentation of the sugar. The fermentation being
            accomplished the yeast will be deposited in the fermented
            liquor and be preserved there unaltered indefinitely, as if
            in lethargy, with its form and its properties. This
            determined, let us take some fresh yeast, as it comes from
            the brewery, washed in distilled water to purify it from
            what it has brought away from the vat, and steep it in from
            three to four times its weight of creosoted distilled water
            to destroy the influence of germs of the air. In this
            situation, so different from its normal condition of
            existence, at the temperature of about 30° C. (86° F.) and
            without any trace of air, it will for a long time disengage
            pure carbonic acid, producing at the same time a relatively
            great amount of alcohol, acetic acid and other products,
            preserv­ing its form all the time. Evidently it has only
            been able to produce all these these things at the expense
            of its own substance, of its contents, since its tegument at
            first remains whole. And if the process of alteration is
            allowed to continue, this tegument itself will disappear,
            its microzymas will become free and vibrios appear.1</p>
          <p style="background: white">The following is the method by
            which the mechanism of the spontaneous destruction of the
            cellule of beer yeast can be most easily studied. It is well
            known that yeast does not cause fecula to ferment. But what
            is not known is, that it liquefies the starch of fecula and
            is completely destroyed in producing the liquifaction,
            leaving of its organism nothing but its microzymas, the
            soluble part of their content being left in the
            circumambient medium. The phenomenon lasts a greater or less
            time according to the quantity of creosote employed to
            destroy the influence of the germs of the air. If the
            quantity of creosote is small the microzymas undergo
            vibrionian evolution, if it is sufficient the microzymas do
            not evolve.2 But that is not all. Thus studied, the
            phenomenon of the spontaneous destruction of the cellule of
            beer yeast has enabled me to confirm the generality of the
            fact which I had long before observed in studying the
            microzymian origin of the vibrioniens.</p>

          <i> </i>
          <p style="background: white">While the globule of yeast is
            being destroyed and its microzymas set free and begin to
            undergo vibrionian evolution, several phases of this
            evolution are to be observed, which Estor and I have
            described from the commencement of our researches upon the
            liver, etc.,1 namely, at first the microzymas are scarcely
            altered in their size and form; then microzymas coupled in
            the form of the figure 8, then chaplets of microzymas of
            from 3 to 10 and 20 grains, all of the same size; then
            vibrios properly so called; then bacteria often very large,
            motile or not; also the amylobacters of Trecul, free or
            fastened end to end. When the phenomenon is not checked by
            an addition of creosote or carbolic acid, all these
            productions maybe seen at the same time in the field of the
            microscope. Now if without changing any of the conditions of
            the experiment the observation of it is continued, it will
            be seen that all the forms other than the single microzymas
            disappear successively; first the amylobacters disappear;
            new forms of smaller dimensions appear and disappear in
            turn, so that in the end there remain only swarms of motile
            forms scarcely differing from the original microzymas which
            had evoluted.</p>
          <p style="background: white"><i>1. C. R. Vol. LXVI. p. 421,
              and p. 859 (1868).</i></p>
          <i> </i>
          <p style="background: white">Speaking then in the language of
            anatomy, we may say that the microzymas become vibrioniens
            by evolution; the vibrios, the bacteria, the vibrioniens in
            general, return to the microzymian form by an inverse
            phenomenon of evolution, the ultimate forms differing in
            little or nothing from the microzymas, the anatomical
            element of the cellule.</p>
          <p style="background: white">It is thus directly demonstrated
            that a yeast globule, a cellule in general, in being
            destroyed sets its own microzymas free; that these, if the
            necessary conditions are realized, become vibrioniens by
            evolution, which, in the same apparent conditions, by an
            inverse phenomenon reproduce the microzymas.</p>
          <p style="background: white">So that as Estor and I have
            demonstrated in the development of the embryonic cellules of
            the fowl, and as I have demonstrated in the case of beer
            yeast and in the case of cellules which may develop in the
            mother of vinegar, the microzymas which are the commencement
            of all cellular and tissue organization are also their end,
            being, as we have seen, the end even of the bacteria.</p>
          <p style="background: white">Now that which is true of the
            microzymas of beer yeast is true also of the microzymas of
            all cellules, of all tissues, both of animals and of plants.
            And this fact has been confirmed unwittingly even by those
            who deny the microzymas and who, to avoid naming them, have
            called them punctiform ferments; a microzyma or
            microzymas-producers at the beginning, microzymas at the
            end, such are the beginnings and the ends of a bacterium and
            of a cellule.</p>
          <p style="background: white">Thus all natural animal and
            vegetable matters, that is to say, organized as Bichat
            conceived them and defined their organization, the
            anatomical elements morphologically definite, are the only
            things living in them; yes, all these matters, from the
            highest in organization down to beeryeast, are spontaneously
            alterable from the moment that they are no longer in the
            situation of their natural conditions of existence,
            chemically and anatomically.</p>
          <p style="background: white">In insisting upon their chemical
            alterations, especially upon the production of alcohol, of
            acetic acid, of lactic acid and of benzoic acid, with or
            without the disengagement of carbonic acid gas, etc., I
            wished to show that these alterations belong to the class of
            the best known fermentations, which assume a living figured
            ferment. But even in the spontaneous alteration of
            beeryeast, alcohol and acetic acid are not the only products
            formed; I described others in 1864; on further studying
            these latter I have found succinic acid, a special gummy
            substance, a ternary, furnishing mucic acid, leucin and
            tyrosin, nitrogenous compounds whose formation bears witness
            that the albuminoids of the yeast contribute to the changes;
            later others have been found equally nitrogenous, etc. In
            extending these researches upon yeast to the spontaneous
            alterations of the flesh of the horse and that of fish,
            these researches have been verified by isolating similar or
            analogous products.</p>
          <p style="background: white">But since these spontaneous
            chemical alterations belong to the class of fermentations
            which presuppose the presence of a figured ferment, what is
            this ferment? For if the beer yeast which causes sugar to
            ferment puts in it a part of itself, of its transformed
            content which is recovered among the products of normal
            fermentation, it is not destroyed; it remains whole, its
            tegument preserving to it its form, with its own anatomical
            element-microzymas. On the other hand, when it produces
            alcohol spontaneously, without sugar, it alters, and is
            destroyed, as are destroyed the cellules and the
            organization of the blood, of flesh, of the liver, etc. It
            is not then these cellules and these tissues which are the
            ferments of the spontaneous fermentations. M. Pasteur sought
            in the altered blood the vibrio born of the germs of the air
            and, not finding it, concluded that there was neither
            fermentation nor even chemical alteration in it; there are
            nevertheless fer­mentations without vibrios and without
            cellules in which are produced alcohol and acetic acid; in
            the first phase of the alteration of milk, for instance, and
            in that of eggs jolted up within the shell. These ferments
            are precisely the microzymas, often the vibrioniens
            resulting from their evolution, and microzymas which are the
            result of the destruction of the latter, for at a given
            moment, either at the commencement or at the end of the
            phenomenon, there is in the medium which is altering or of
            which the alteration is completed no production
            morphologically defined other than the microzymas of origin
            or the microzymas resulting from their destruction.</p>
          <p style="background: white">And this is not a gratuitous
            assertion, for I have experimentally proved that the
            microzymas of animal origin and those of the yeast are
            actually the figured ferments which produce, with sugar or
            fecula, alcohol, acetic acid, lactic acid, and by
            fermentation of the lactate of chalk, butyric acid. And it
            is precisely the microzymas of the microzymian molecular
            granulations of the blood or those of the blood globules
            which belong to that class.</p>
          <p style="background: white">From all these experiments it
            results incontestably that the microzymas of living
            organisms in general, and those of the blood and of the
            blood globules in particular, are anatomical elements and
            are themselves figured ferments; that is to say, that they
            are living and organized in the same manner as it is
            admitted that yeast is so; as are also the vibrioniens which
            these microzymas may become by evolution, out of the same
            organized substance. But the microzymas are living beings of
            an entirely special order without analogy, on which I have
            insisted for a long time and again insist upon as crowning
            the demonstration that the blood is veritably a tissue.</p>
          <p style="background: white">And now what happens when this or
            any tissue whatever alters? First it is no longer preserved
            in the state in which it exists and functions in the
            organism, in coordination, to speak as does Dr. Antoine
            Gros, in general coordination with the functioning of all
            the organs and of their tissues; it has then, as we have
            established for the albuminoid atmosphere of the hematic
            microzymian molecular granulations and for the coloring
            matter of the contents of the red globule, to undergo, owing
            to the change in the conditions of its existence, some
            chemical change in some of its parts; it is in short that
            its special anatomical elements change their form and their
            function to the extent of being destroyed and disappear­ing,
            leaving the microzymas as the only trace of their existence
            which, according to circumstances, do or do not undergo
            vibrionian evolution. And the anatomical change maybe so
            rapid, as is well known to histologists, that one is obliged
            to take steps to preserve the integrity of the tissues. In
            fact, one or two minutes may suffice, after the blood has
            been shed, to render it impossible to demonstrate the third
            anatomical element.</p>
          <p style="background: white">We must conclude then that in all
            the experiments, including those of M. Pasteur, the chemical
            and anatomical alteration in the blood is the work solely of
            the microzymas, which, in certain conditions, do not become
            bacteria. As to the question, to what order the chemical
            phenomenon belongs, it is now solved; since every chemical
            transformation of a proximate principle of organic matter,
            under the influence of a figured ferment, is called
            fermentation or putrefaction, it is evident that the
            spontaneous chemical alterations of the blood are the result
            of a fermentation or of a putrefaction without fetid
            products.</p>
          <p style="background: white">Assuredly, whenever the
            experiment on the blood shall be taken up upon a larger
            scale, even under the conditions of that of M. Pasteur,
            other products will be discovered besides those which I have
            pointed out, and among them I should not be surprised if
            alcohol should be found to be one of them.</p>
          <p style="background: white">It is now evident what is the
            real meaning of the phenomenon called the spontaneous
            coagulation of the blood; it is the following: The blood,
            being a tissue, is necessarily alterable itself, as is well
            known are all tissues, and as are all natural organic
            matters, animal or vegetable, that which is called
            coagulation being only the first phase of its more complete
            change, which extends to disorganization and to the
            disappearance of its globules. And the phenomenon in its
            entirety is the work of the microzymas, which, acting
            phys­iologically as ferments, effect the chemical
            transformation of the proximate principles, and thereby the
            anatomical changes, which end in the disorganization of the
            tissues and of the cellules.</p>
          <p style="background: white">But, as I have said, the
            microzymas are living beings of a special order without
            analogy, as I have shown in other publications, upon which I
            have promised to insist afresh to give to this work and to
            its demonstration their highest character of certainty and
            also to refute new errors upon which I had only touched in a
            casual manner in a former work.1 This will be the subject of
            the following chapter.</p>

          <p style="background: white">The demonstration that the blood
            is a flowing tissue, and like it spontaneously alterable,
            rests entirely upon the discovery of the microzymas,
            individual living organisms, unsuspected, but existing
            normally, and, consequently, necessarily as figured elements
            in all the parts of every living organism, in every cellule
            of that organism, ab ovo et semine, during the entire
            duration of its development and of its existence in the
            physiological condition of perfect health. This discovery
            has furnished the demonstration that all the tissues and
            humors are spontaneously alterable, because they contain,
            inherent in themselves, the agents of their alterability,
            the microzymas, which by evolution may become vibrios or, in
            certain fixed conditions, bacteria; all of which has been
            disputed and even denied.</p>
          <p style="background: white">It is this principle, so
            conformable to the conception of Bichat regarding the
            existence of anatomical elements autonomically living, so
            entirely opposed to the doctrine of a living matter without
            living figured elements, called proto­plasm or blastema,
            which I have had to oppose and still oppose against certain
            savants to justify the fact that the blood is really a
            tissue and as such spontaneously alterable.</p>
          <p style="background: white">The following is a statement of
            the starting point of the dispute and of the denial.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Section20">
          <p style="background: white">The fact of the spontaneous
            alterability of organic matters under the conditions which
            Macquer specified was admitted in science as an
            incontestable truth. I have described, in the first chapter,
            how this belief had been so generalized, that the
            spontaneous alteration of all proximate principles (even
            that of cane sugar) was admitted. But, as I have
            demonstrated, it is only through the action of germs of the
            air, whose existence, even notwithstanding the hypothesis of
            Spallanzani was denied, that this alteration occur­red which
            had the appearance of being spontanteous. But at the same
            time that I demonstrated that Macquer was right as regards
            plants and animals, tissues and humors, I showed that of the
            three conditions specified by Macquer, suitable humidity, a
            certain temperature and momentary contact with the air, the
            first two only were essential, the air and its germs might
            be entirely suppressed.</p>
          <p style="background: white">M. Pasteur admitted the
            spontaneous alterability of organic matters in general and
            explicitly asserted that ferments, beer yeast, lactic yeast,
            vibrios, were spontaneously born of the albuminoid matter of
            the broth of sweetened yeast; M. Pasteur, having repeated my
            experiments, was so convinced that germs do really exist in
            the air and that he had been mistaken, thenceforward
            declared that the sole origin of the ferments, vibrios
            included, was these germs he had previously disregarded, and
            that consequently these germs were the first cause of the
            spontaneous alteration of all organic matters without
            exception. He experimented for the purpose of proving that
            without the germs of the air unputrefying corpses would
            accumulate upon the earth and even calculated the
            consequences of such accumulation. Thence to deny the
            microzymas and contest the conse­quences of their discovery
            was but a step which, later, he did not fail to make. In
            fact his own experiments on milk and on boiled urine, those
            upon blood and upon raw meat, were made by him, in the ardor
            of his new conviction for the purpose of combatting the
            doctrine of spontaneous generation by the same weapons I had
            employed, and not against the microzymas which I had not yet
            named. It was only in 1876 that M. Pasteur began to deny and
            to dispute the facts of the microzymian theory which had
            been nearly all published in 1871, and since 1874 had been
            verified and confirmed in France and abroad. But although
            verified and confirmed they were also interpreted; for the
            sake of history and comparison it is desirable that these
            interpretations should be known.</p>
          <p style="background: white">Charles Robin was the first to
            speak of microzymas as being things which by evolution may
            become bacteria. But the way in which he understood the
            existence of the micro­zymas in the animal body needs to be
            mentioned. He admitted without difficulty the two meanings
            attributed by M. Pasteur to his experiment upon the blood:</p>
          <p style="background: white">First: That the blood does not
            change of itself.</p>
          <p style="background: white">Second: That the bodies of
            animals are closed to germs from without, and, consequently,
            that within the body there is nothing which could become
            bacteria.</p>
          <p style="background: white">Ch. Robin even asserted that
            Pasteur had proved positively and beyond question that the
            human economy is absolutely closed to penetration by
            bacteria. Nevertheless, the observations of Davaine and
            Rayer, of Coze and Feltz, etc., had demonstrated that in
            certain diseases bacteria appeared in the blood.</p>
          <p style="background: white">Unwilling to admit that the
            microzymas existed in it as anatomical elements, they said
            that one of two things must be confessed; either that
            bacteria are the results of a spontaneous generation into
            the state of the microzyma, passing into the state of
            bacteria, or that the microzymas reach the blood by
            penetration in the same manner as granules of dust, etc.1
            The alternative exposed the perplexity of this savant's</p>
          <p style="background: white"><i>1. Ch. Robin. "Lecons sur les
              humeurs."p. 255 (1874).</i></p>

        <i> </i>
        <div class="Section22"><i> </i>
          <p style="background: white">position. In fact, Ch. Robin was
            a protoplasmist, after a fashion; an anatomical element such
            as the microzyma passing, as he said, into the state of a
            bacterium, among the ordinary anatomical elements, which he
            knew so well, disarranged all his ideas. But with the
            loyalty of an impartial man of science, he did not hesitate
            to class the microzymas in the same category as the
            bacteria; thus in an article in the dictionary he asked
            whence come the microzymas into the living organism? It was
            doubtless the perplexity of which I have above spoken which
            caused him to compare the microzymas to the micrococcus of
            the botanist, Hallier, of Jena, or to identify them with the
            Bacterium punctum of Ehrenberg.1</p>
          <p style="background: white"><i>1. ibid,. loc. cit.. p. 230
              (1874).</i></p>
          <i> </i>
          <p style="background: white">Two years later an honest savant,
            of Switzerland, stated as follows:</p>
          <p style="background: white">"It is within my knowledge that
            it was A. Bechamp who first regarded certain molecular
            granulations, which he named microzymas, as being organized
            ferments, and formulated the three following propositions,
            based upon researches which he had pursued jointly with
            Estor:</p>
          <p style="background: white">First. In all the animal cellules
            which have been exam­ined there exist of necessity normal
            granulations, analogous to those named microzymas by
            Bechamp.</p>
          <p style="background: white">Second. In the physiological
            condition, the microzymas preserve the apparent form of a
            sphere.</p>
          <p style="background: white">Third. Outside of the economy,
            without the intervention of any foreign germ, the microzymas
            lose their normal form; they begin by becoming associated in
            chaplets, of which a separate genus has been made under the
            name of Torula, next they become lengthened so as to
            resemble bacteria isolated or associated; and he added: "It
            is evident that the subsequent researches of Billroth and of
            Tiegel are in their results only the confirmation of these
            three propositions."</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Section23">
          <p style="background: white">Then, experimenting on the
            pancreas of ruminants and of freshly killed dogs, he
            declared there were always to be found the same molecular
            granulations, having the brownian movement, and which became
            vibrioniens by evolution. These molecular granulations, he
            exclaimed,</p>
          <p style="background: white">"Are evidently the microzymas of
            Bechamp, the coccos of Billroth and, without hesitation, he
            affirmed that they were the Monas Crepusculum of
            Ehrenberg."1</p>
          <p style="background: white"><i>1. Dr. M. Nencki, Ueber die
              Zersetzung der gelatine and des Eiweisses bei der

              Buchhandlung (1876).</i></p>
          <i> </i>
          <p style="background: white">Again, later, M. Nencki, in
            collaboration with M. Giacosa, confirmed our observations
            generally, working upon the same tissues as we had done, but
            being unwilling to class the microzymas as anatomical
            elements to the extent that when the bacteria and vibrios
            were no longer to be regarded as animals they should be
            regarded as plants under the name of Schizomycetes, he came
            at last to hold that the microzymas are the spores of these
            infusorial plants.</p>
          <p style="background: white">Thus the facts were verified and
            confirmed in every sense; they exist in all the parts, down
            to the cellules of every living organism, ab ovo et semine
            of figured ferments and are capable of becoming bacteria;
            but instead of regarding them in such situations as
            autochthones (aborigines) they were regarded as being there,
            either the fruit of spontaneous generation according to one
            of the suppositions of Ch. Robin, or as foreigners under the
            names of Bacterium punctum, of Monas crepusculum, of Coccus,
            of Micrococcus, of pointed microbe, and finally of Spores of
            Schizomycetes. Nevertheless, if the microzymas are not what
            I contend they are, autonomous anatomical elements, the
            alternative stated by Ch. Robin remains; spontaneous
            generation or penetration! But then what becomes of the
            dogma of closure, and that of non-putrefiability? These will
            be abjured rather than admit the microzymas among essential
            anatomical elements! In fact, M. Cornil, before the
            admission of M. Pasteur, declared as follows, in 1886:</p>
          <p style="background: white">"M Pasteur has abundantly
            demonstrated that our tissues and interior media, like the
            blood, contain no microorganisms, no more than the urine,
            except such as have been introduced from without, and the
            experiments of our illustrious colleague have been confirmed
            in all countries."1</p>
          <p style="background: white">Then M. Cornil, continuing to
            deny the facts I had advanced, but admitting the views of
            those who believed in parasitic microzymas, exclaimed:</p>
          <p style="background: white">"Messrs. Nencki and Giacosa
            regard the word microzyma as the synonym for micrococcus; if
            this synonymity be admitted, if the microzyma is merely a
            genus of the Schizomycetes, the word microzyma ought to
            disappear and the whole doctrine of M. Bechamp will vanish.
            "2</p>
          <p style="background: white">But after M. Pasteur's admission
            of the presence of microorganisms in the altered blood of
            his experiments, it was more than ever necessary to get rid
            of the annoying word microzyma; therefore went M. Cornil to
            Germany to call M. Nencki to the rescue. He replied
            (according to M. Cornil):</p>
          <p style="background: white">"The microzymas of M. Bechamp are
            in my opinion either the micrococcus or spores of bacteria
            and you are right in saying that for me the microzymas of M.
            Bechamp are spores of Schizomycetes."3</p>
          <p style="background: white"><i>1.&nbsp; Bulletin de 1'Acad.

            </i><i> 3. M. Comil did not say spores, but genus of

              none the less.</i></p>
          <i> </i>
          <p style="background: white">And this reply of M. Nencki was
            communicated by M. Cornil to the Academy of Medicine.</p>
          <p style="background: white">If M. Cornil was satisfied, he
            was satisfied with very little, since his correspondent
            could not go back on his inter­pretation of ten years
            before. In fact, the matter in question was not one of
            synonymy and interpretation, but of a principle disputed and
            of {acts denied by himself, following M. Pasteur. This
            principle and these facts, did M. Nencki deny them? That is
            the question. The principle disputed is the following, just
            as 1 had enunciated it in a letter to J. B. Dumas in 1865:</p>
          <p style="background: white">"Chalk and milk contain living
            beings already developed, a fact which observed directly is
            also proved by this fact, that creosote employed in a
            non-coagulating dose docs not prevent the milk from clotting
            later; nor the chalk from transforming, without outside
            help, sugar and fecula, into alcohol, acetic acid, lactic
            acid and butyric acid."1</p>
          <p style="background: white"><i>1. Annales de chimie et de
              Physique, 4th Series, Vol. VI, p. 248.</i></p>
          <i> </i>
          <p style="background: white">The following year (1866) I gave
            the name of microzymas to the living beings already
            developed in the chalk and milk, so as to mark the fact that
            they were figured ferments. It will be seen that this
            bringing together the chalk and the milk was intentional on
            my part.</p>
          <p style="background: white">It was this principle derived
            from experiment: that creosote which hinders the proximate
            principles from altering on contact with a limited quantity
            of air does not prevent natural organic matters from being
            altered in fermenting, which was disputed; and it was the
            presence of the microzymas, agents of these spontaneous
            fermentations, and their capacity to become bacteria by
            evolution, which was denied. But M. Nencki admitted both the
            principle and the facts; he had even avowed that M.M.
            Billroth and Tiegel had only confirmed the facts.</p>
          <p style="background: white">After that, it is of little
            moment, that they have said in turn that the microzymas are
            the Bacterium punctum, the Monas crepusculum, spores of
            bacteria, called Schizomycetes after having been regarded as
            animal-cules. I remark only that these various appellations
            prove merely that they do not know what to believe; but we
            shall see at the end of this chapter that the name microzyma
            has been well chosen, and that they are what they have been
            said to be, anatomical elements and living beings of a
            category not before suspected and without analogy.</p>
          <p style="background: white">Meanwhile the principle of the
            demonstration that the blood is a tissue whose change by
            fermentation, outside of the vessels, is spontaneous, as is
            that of every other tissue outside of the economy, is
            certain, both by the acknowledgment of M. Pasteur and by the
            declaration of M. Nencki obtained by M. Cornil. But if the
            principle is recognized, can it be asserted that the fact
            that the blood is a tissue has not been sufficiently proved?
            It is necessary to insist further.</p>
          <p style="background: white">I have already remarked that it
            is not enough that figured elements exist in a humor to
            entitle the humor to be regarded as a tissue. In the order
            of the ideas of Bichat, concerning elementary tissues, it is
            necessary to prove that these figured elements (i.e. having
            a certain form), regarded as anatomical elements, are really
            living; this is what I began doing; but even this is not
            enough, it must further be shown dial, as in tissues
            generally, these elements, almost in contact, are separated
            and yet connected among themselves by an intercellular
            substance in such wise that the smallest mass of the complex
            tissue contains them.</p>
          <p style="background: white">If the blood were a homogeneous
            liquid holding the microzymas in the condition in which they
            are isolated from the fibrin, that is to say, naked, in
            suspension with the globules, they would be separated and
            deposited notwithstanding the movement of the blood, because
            they are of greater density than it, in the same manner that
            rivers charged with argilacious mud deposit it
            notwithstanding the motion of the water. But the blood does
            not hold the microzymas naked, but surrounded by an
            atmosphere of special albuminoid mailer; in short, the blood
            contains the microzymian molecular granulations; and the
            albuminoid atmosphere, mucous, hyaline and swollen, gives to
            these granulations a density very little differing from,
            perhaps the sa&nbsp; hat of the intergranular and
            interglobular substance which connects them; in such wise
            that the molecular granulations with the globules pervade at
            once the entire mass of the blood.</p>
          <p style="background: white">The structure of the
            haematic-microzymian-molecular-granulations is precisely
            that which was needed to constitute the blood, with its
            globules a tissue. It is because of their mucous atmosphere,
            which swells enormously, that these innumerable
            microzymian-molecular-granulations occupy in the blood the
            entire space not occupied by the globules and the thin bed
            of the intergranular and interglobular liquid substance; and
            it is due to this special viscosity that the swollen mucous
            atmosphere of the microzymian molecular granulations, as
            well as to the mechanical obstacle which these present, that
            the globules remain uniformly disseminated and are not
            precipitated during coagulation outside of the vessels
            before the production of the clot; as to the special case of
            the blood of the solipedes, it is due to the great
            differ­ence between the density of the globules of their
            blood, and to some peculiarity of the mucous atmosphere of
            their microzymian granulations, connected with the lower
            density of the intergranular liquid.</p>
          <p style="background: white">The demonstration that the blood
            is a tissue, and a flowing tissue, follows from the relation
            of the three anatom­ical elements and the intercellular
            liquid substance special to each species. There is not in it
            any sort of mere hypothesis.</p>
          <p style="background: white">But the blood, as a tissue,
            belongs to a special anatomical system of organs whereof it
            is the content; but if it be true that the various
            anatomical systems are differentiated by their microzymas as
            they are by their form and structure, must it not be the
            same with the circulatory system? and in fact that is the
            case.</p>

        <div class="Section28">
          <p style="background: white">The microzymas of the vascular
            system, container and content, are different from those of
            the other anatomical systems.</p>
          <p style="background: white">I have proved this proposition in
            the comparative study of the decomposition of oxygenated
            water by the microzymas of various animal tissues, and I
            then extended this study to that of the microzymas of
            various plant tissues.</p>
          <p style="background: white">The results will be found in the
            following tables and have been obtained as follows: Into a
            graduated tube, over mercury, are introduced several cubic
            centimetres of non-acidulated oxygenated water of known
            standard. The tube is then reversed and one c.c. of
            microzymas in cake, enveloped in silk paper, is introduced
            for from 3 to 5 vol. of water, oxygenated, to 10 to 12 vol.
            of oxygen, and the rapidity and the volume of the oxygen set
            free in 24 hours are noted. As mercury by itself can set
            free oxygen from oxygenated water, a lube having the same
            volume of this water serves as a control.</p>
          <p style="background: white">A similar tube receives the dust
            of the laboratory introduced under the same conditions as
            the microzymas.</p>

          <p style="background: white">A comparison of the results of
            these three tables is very instructive.</p>
          <p style="background: white">From a comparison of the first
            two, which relate to the tissues of animals, it is seen that
            the microzymas of the circulatory system, including therein
            those of the urine, are those which decompose oxygenated
            water with the greatest energy, setting free the most
            oxygen, and at the same time, that it is the hematic
            microzymas and those of the lung and of the liver which are
            most active; and these are the organs which are most
            directly concerned in the circuit. This I wish especially to
            make clear, to demonstrate that the circulatory system was
            differentiated from the other anatomical sys­tems by a
            special property of its microzymas; a property so special
            that one might almost think that the other tissues owe their
            like power only to the hematic microzymas which they retain.
            But this cannot be, for the microzymas of the thoroughly
            drained liver are as active as those of the blood, etc.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Section32">
          <p style="background: white">The results of the second table
            are still more significant, for one cannot suppose that any
            hematic microzymas can be present among the vitellin nor yet
            among those of the saliva and urine. And if, in short, there
            remained the least doubt the result of the third table must
            remove them, by a consideration of the action of the
            amygdalic microzymas and that of those of beer yeast, which
            further proves that differences of the same kind are
            presented by the microzymas of the different plant tissues.</p>
          <p style="background: white">The microzymas of the vascular
            system, the container and its content, differ then from the
            microzymas of the other anatomical systems with regard to
            their power of decomposing oxygenated water; this is also to
            be seen from the observations of Thenard above mentioned
            when correctly interpreted. And these differences are seen
            to be still greater when we study comparatively the
            physiological functional aptitudes of the various anatomical
            systems in man and other animals.</p>
          <p style="background: white">For instance, while the
            pancreatic and gastric glands of the dog and of ruminants
            are endowed with like functional properties in digestion, it
            is otherwise with the salivary and parotid glands of man and
            those of the dog or horse: the salivary and parotidian
            microzymas of man liquify and sac­charify powerfully the
            starch of fecula; the like microzymas of the dog or horse
            liquify but slowly and do not saccharify at all the same
            starch. Thus the zymas secreted by the micro­zymas of the
            same gland in man and in other animals is essentially
            different. Morphologically identical these microzymas are
            functionally different, and I am certain that the more these
            are studied the more reasons will be found for
            differentiating the microzymas of the microzymian molec­ular
            granulations of the blood of the various species of ani­mals
            and those of their globules, as I have differentiated the
            haematic-microzymian-molecular-granulations.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Section33">
          <p style="background: white">And the microzymian theory of the
            living organization explains why this should be; it is
            because the microzymas of each species are autonomous in it
            and are, ab ovo, what they should be and become in order
            that each species should propagate itself, develop itself,
            preserve itself, and after death, thanks to oxygen, that
            each individual should undergo that total destruction which
            reduces all substances except the microzymas to the mineral
            condition. If they were not anatomically autonomous why
            should they differ and be functionally various in species
            and in their anatomical systems? I have already answered
            this question,1 and am answered by bald denials only. It is
            then worth while to adduce new considerations to convince
            those whom the assertions of Cornil and of Nencki might yet
            lead astray.</p>

          <p style="background: white">To place beyond dispute the
            autonomy of the microzymas it is necessary to bring into
            prominence the facts and observations which prove that the
            existence of the microzymas as living beings has not been
            suspected by those naturalists who have studied the
            infusoria, nor yet by the anatomists who have studied the
            cellules and the tissues.</p>
          <p style="background: white">Demonstration that the
            microzymas, autonomous anatomical elements in living
            organisms, are living beings, morphologically determined,
            belonging to a category of their own, having no analogue.</p>
          <p style="background: white">Let us first get rid of the
            hypotheses that the microzymas are either the bacterium
            termo, or the Monas crepusculum, or the Micrococcus, or the
            spores of bacteria.</p>
          <p style="background: white">It is to be borne in mind that I
            gave the name of microzyma at first to the geological
            figured ferment of the chalk of Sens and of another
            calcareous earth; that I have discovered this ferment in
            other calcareous rocks, always of a spherical form, very
            brilliant, having the brownian movement and smaller than all
            the vibrioniens described by authors.' Ehrenberg described
            (in the chalk) the remains of fossil microscopic organisms
            called Polythalamies and Nautilites, but makes no mention
            either of Monas crepusculum nor of Bacterium punctum. In
            fact, none of the microzymas can be confounded with those
            described by Ehrenberg under those names. The microzymas are
            even smaller than the Bacterium termo, the smallest of the
            known infusoria, the first term of the animal kingdom,
            according to Felix Dujardin.</p>
          <p style="background: white">Nevertheless the microzymas had
            been seen in cloudy infusions of vegetable and animal
            matters, but they were taken for "the active molecules of
            Robert Brown"; that is to say, for molecules having the
            staggering or scintillating movement without change of
            place, called "brownian movement," and no further attention
            was paid to them.</p>
          <p style="background: white">In fact, the microzymas are
            neither the Bacterium punctum, nor the Monas crepusculum,
            nor even the Bacterium termo, which is much smaller than
            they. It will be sufficient to establish this fact by
            referring to the description of these monas, etc., given by
            F. Dujardin, in his "Historie Naturelle des Zoophytes,"
            Infusoria, pp. 215 and 279.</p>
          <p style="background: white">On the other hand, if these
            bacteria, these monads, these micrococci, belong to
            determined species, it is contrary to the data of natural
            history to regard them as capable of being transformed into
            other genera and species of vibrioniens, as we see the
            microzymas produce them by evolution; the suggestion that
            the microzymas are the spores of schizomycetes is also
            untenable for the following reasons: A spore is a seminulum,
            or an egg, if according to the old view, the bacteria are
            animals, and search has been made for the eggs of bacteria;
            a grain, if according to the new creed the bacteria are
            vegetable; egg or grain, a spore cannot multiply itself as
            the microzyma does, and cannot therefore be the same thing.</p>
          <p style="background: white">Take the microzymas of the ovule
            in the Graafian vesicle in the fowl, and the microzymas of
            the vitellus of the mature egg. In the ovule there are
            ovular microzymas, in the vitellus, vitelline microzymas. At
            a given moment there are, say, a milligramme of microzymas
            in the ovule, and there are two or three grammes dried at
            100° C. (I have isolated and weighed them) in the vitellus.1</p>
          <p style="background: white">They have then multiplied
            prodigiously during the development of the vitellus.2</p>
          <p style="background: white">So much then for the anatomical
            analysis for the egg of the fowl, and the chemical analysis
            shows that the elementary composition of the ovular
            microzymas is not the same as that of the vitellin, the
            former, as will be seen, being less carbonized; evidently
            their composition changed in the process of multiplication.3</p>
          <p style="background: white">Chemical analysis has further
            demonstrated that the vitellin microzymas of several species
            of birds differ from those of the fowl in their composition
            and especially in the properties of their respective
            zymases.4 This accords exactly with the microzymian theory,
            for it is evident that the microzymas are what they should
            be specifically, in order that, by incubation, the egg
            should produce the proper bird, its tissues, and all that
            pertains to its future being. And it has been demonstrated
            that during the development of the being, parallel with the
            anatomical development by the multiplication of the
            microzymas, there is a functional development of these, so
            that in each anatomical system they become that which they
            successively are in the embryo, in the foetus, in the adult,
            etc.</p>

          <p style="background: white">If the hypothesis that the
            microzymas are the spores of bacteria were true, it would be
            necessary that there should first have existed in the
            circumambient atmosphere as many species of these spores as
            there are species of animal and vegetable ovules; next it
            would be necessary for these spores to penetrate as far as,
            and into the ovule, and should there multiply to fill up the
            vitellus of the egg of the fowl. I need go no further, for
            there are still otherwise enormous difficulties, when we
            take into consideration the microzymas of the developed
            being, which are so different from the embryonal and foetal
            microzymas! But it now lies with the opponents of the
            microzymian theory to demonstrate the existence of these
            spores and of their penetration as far as, and into, the
            ovules and their multiplication.</p>
          <p style="background: white">We have thus discarded the
            hypothesis opposed to that of autonomy. It is also discarded
            by the following consideration, which deserves being
            underscored.</p>
          <p style="background: white">Shortly before M. Pasteur's
            admission in 1886 of the presence of the microzymas in the
            altered blood of his experiment, he had, for the purpose of
            denying them, asserted that the microzymas were the
            molecular granulations "which we all know." This was to his
            confreres of the Academy.</p>
          <p style="background: white">Yes, histologists and
            anatomo-pathologists knew them and represented them by a
            "stippling" in their figures of special tissues. But their
            name even betrayed the opinion that they were neither
            organized nor living; in effect, the qualification of
            molecular was intended to indicate that it meant only small
            collections of some sort of matter; thus they were described
            as white, gray, minerals, fats, albuminoids, etc. They were
            even described as possessing the brownian movement;
            nevertheless, before the discovery of the microzymas, no one
            thought of connecting them either with the bacterium punctum
            or the monas crepusculum. They were connected with
            anatomical organisms as being the remains of tissues, of
            destroyed cellules, or as amorphous matter; no one dreamed
            of making them come from outside. No consideration of the
            anatomical-molecular-granulations had anything to do with
            the discovery of the microzymas, but, as I have shown above,
            purely chemical considerations.</p>
          <p style="background: white">No, the molecular granulations
            are not the microzymas. And from the time of our first note,
            Estor and I have stated that the microzymas exist only among
            the anatomical objects which in histology are called
            molecular granulations. But we held the microzymas to be
            autonomous anatomical elements; a more careful anatomical
            analysis enabled me to demonstrate that there exist naked
            microzymas and microzymas in the condition which I have
            termed microzymian molecular granulations.</p>
          <p style="background: white">Thus is disproved another
            gratuitous and erroneous assertion!</p>
          <p style="background: white">I return to the microzymas. I had
            described them from the commencement as being chemically and
            physiologically figured ferments, producers of zymases,
            which are called soluble ferments, and were placed in the
            same category as me figured ferments which are insoluble.
            Biologically, I distinguished them as being such as by
            evolution could become vibrionien, a fact which we have seen
            to be verified in every sense. But in the experiments on
            spontaneous alterations, or fermentations, wherein
            microzymas become bacteria, we have seen that these were
            destroyed and that vibrioniens more and more minute appeared
            in their place, so that at last there remained only of these
            bacteria the forms nearest to the microzymas; in the same
            manner consequently, that by their destruction the cellules
            set their microzymas free, the bacteria in their complete
            destruction reproduce microzymas similar to those of the
            chalk, and we will now see how that is.</p>
          <p style="background: white">In the experiments on the
            spontaneous alterations of natural animal matters, the
            substances, which in a chemical sense are termed organic,
            which result from transformations by fermentation under the
            influence of the microzymas, before and after their
            vibrionian evolution, with or without the setting free of
            gas, are never entirely destroyed; that is to say, they are
            not reduced to a mineral condition, carbonic acid, water,
            nitrogen, etc.; for such destruction oxygen is necessary
            under conditions which reproduce those realized in
            geological epochs.</p>
          <p style="background: white">When I had discovered the
            microzymas in the chalk and in other calcareous rock, and
            became convinced that they were not dependent on atmospheric
            germs, I asked myself if they were not the living remains of
            organized being which had disappeared in geologic times.1
            This hypothesis was verified in the following manner:</p>
          <p style="background: white">A kitten was killed and buried
            between two beds of pure carbonate of lime, and left in a
            cylindrical glass vessel, covered with a small quantity of
            paper in such wise that the air had free access to it, but
            its dust was excluded. The experiment lasted seven years.
            Every part of the body, except some fragments of bone, had
            disappeared. The carbonate of lime was perfectly white, so
            complete had been the work of destruction. Under the
            microscope, nothing was to be seen in the upper layers of
            the carbonate except microscopic crystals of aragonite of
            this carbonate; but in the beds adjacent to the place, and
            underneath, where the kitten had been, and beneath, there
            were crowds of glittering motile microzymas, such as are to
            be seen in the chalk of Sens, etc.</p>
          <p style="background: white">And with this kind of artificial
            calcareous rock, containing the microzymas of an animal of
            the present day, I was able to repeat the experiments on
            fermentation which I had made with the chalk of Sens and
            with other calcareous rocks, both lacustrine and marine.2
            Such was the first experimental verification of the
            hypothesis that the microzymas of the chalk and of
            calcareous rocks are the organized remains, still living, of
            the beings which lived in the geological ages of the earths
            to which those rocks belonged. Read the note of the Comptes
            Rendus which I have just cited and you will be convinced
            that this verification has also been its vindication.</p>
          <p style="background: white"><i>1. C. R.. Vol. LXX p. 914
              (1870).</i><i><br>
            </i><i> 2. Conference at the Congress of the French
              Association for the Advancement of Science. Nantes (1875).</i></p>
          <p style="background: white">I have said that the microzymas
            of the artificial chalk were the microzymas of an animal of
            the present epoch, but this needs some modification in terms
            to be quite accurate. They were the microzymas of the
            bacteria which the normal microzymas of the animal had first
            become by evolution. By fresh experiments I have learned
            that the microzymas of an entire body, or of the liver, of
            the heart, of the lungs, of the kidneys, under the
            conditions of my experiment become bacteria in the first
            phases of the phenomenon, these then disappear, becoming
            again microzymas, while the rest of the mailer already
            transformed is, under (heir influence, and with access of
            air, reduced to the mineral state, carbonic acid, water,
            nitrogen, etc.1 And I have demonstrated that whereas in the
            climate of Montpellier seven years were required to
            accomplish this, a much longer time would be needed in a
            colder climate, so that in a climate such as that of the Obi
            valley centuries were required.</p>
          <p style="background: white">It was then a legitimate
            conclusion that the microzymas of the calcareous rocks, of
            the clays, of the marls; in short, of all the rocks which
            contain them, are the organized and living remains of beings
            which had been living, of animals and plants of the geologic
            epochs; that these beings were histologically constituted as
            are the beings of our epoch, that their microzymas, during
            their destruction, had become bacteia by evolution, and that
            the microzymas, geological ferments, of these rocks, are
            those of these bacteria destroyed in their turn and reduced
            to their microzymas.</p>

              914, "Les Microzymas," etc., p. 952.</i></p>
          <div class="Section1"> It is not surprising then that, having
            long pursued the anticipated consequences of the hypothesis
            now verified, I have demonstrated the presence of the
            microzymas in the earths of the garrigues of the departments
            of Herault and of Card, in cultivated lands generally, in
            moor lands, in the alluvials, in the waters, in the dust of
            the streets, where they are to be found in crowds; often
            still in the condition of bacteria, proving that, like those
            of the calcareous rocks, they are energetic ferments. And
            already, prior to 1867, I had made known their role in the
            soil in agriculture.
            <p>These researches led to a result of very great
              importance; it was the demonstration that what was and
              still is called germs of the air are essentially nothing
              other than the microzymas of beings which have lived, but
              have disappeared or are being destroyed before our eyes.
              In fact, by precise experiments, I have proved that the
              microzymas of the air are ferments of the same order as
              those of the chalk, of the rocks, and of those of my
              experiments with artificial chalk; only, varying with the
              places, the circumambient a r may, along with these
              microzymas, contain conides of lichens, spores of
              mushrooms, bacteria and everything that the wind can
              disperse in it.1</p>

                LXIII, p. 451; and "Les microzymas." etc., pp. 122, 135.
                940. 952.</i></p>
            <p>There is then no panspermy such as that which Charles
              Bonnet had invented, nor that which Spallanzani and M.
              Pasteur (after me) had admitted. In short, there are no
              pre-existing germs. At each period, as in our days, and in
              each place there exist in the surrounding air only the
              microzymas of former beings which had disappeared and are
              disappearing with the things which the wind scatters in
              it.</p>
            <p>But if we reflect that the species of microzymas are:
              first, as numerous as the species of eggs, of seeds, of
              spores of the various species of animals and plants; next,
              that there are in each animal and vegetable organism,
              already developed or in process of development, microzymas
              as specifically numerous as there are anatomical systems
              and organs, tissues and special cellules in these
              organisms, it is easy to conceive that the species of
              atmospheric microzymas are present in enormous numbers.
              One can also understand the very great number of changes
              which these microzymas may cause, when some one of these
              species fall into a fermentescible medium in which it can
              multiply, and either evolve in it/or build in it a
              cellule, or a mould.</p>
            <p>If then, as I have demonstrated experimentally, there are
              besides microzymas, and as well in animals as in plants,
              among the micro-organisms of the circumambient air,
              spores, conides of fungi, of lichens, even actual cellules
              of ferments,1 it is easy to understand that if these
              micro-organisms fall into fermentescible media they will
              develop in it, each according to its nature, and that
              various productions, moulds, divers cellules, and at the
              same time vibrioniens, may appear in it.2</p>
            <p>But in all the observations and in all the experiments
              relative to the spontaneous change of natural vegetable
              and animal matters, and in the fermentations of sugar or
              of fecula by aid of the tissues and humors of animals,
              when the influence of the micro-organisms of the air has
              been des­troyed or suppressed,3 only microzymas and
              vibrioniens, and vibrios or bacteria, fruits of their
              evolution, are seen; this proves that the microzymas are
              autonomous anatomical elements existing in it of
              themselves.</p>

              </i><i> 3. Here a complementary explanation is necessary
                to explain more clearly the mode of action of creosote
                in the experiments in which it has been employed to
                annihilate the influence of germs of the air. And first
                of all, in speaking of germs, it no longer relates to
                this vague something, which when called upon by Ch.
                Robin to define, M. Pasteur called "origin of life," but
                figured ferments, upon which creosote exercises an
                influence clearly determined. I must therefore recall
                that I have several times insisted on the fuel that
                creosote is efficient in annihilating the influence of
                the germs of a limited volume of the surrounding air,
                unless the air be renewed. And it is so, because a
                limited volume of air contains only limited number of
                micro-organismic ferments. But creosote, while it does
                not prevent the ferments from acting, hinders their
                multiplication. In reality the ferments of a limited
                volume of air, which are capable of acting upon a
                fermentescible medium, do act upon it, but only in
                proportion to their quantity, in such wise that the
                result is so inappreciable that it is as though it were
                nothing; it is thus that the quantity of sugar,
                inverted, in the presence of creosote, by the microzymas
                of a small limited volume of air can be determined
                neither by reagents, nor by the polariscope. But if a
                slow current of several hundred litres of the same air
                is caused to act upon a creosoted solution of sugar the
                microzymas and other micro-organisms retained by the
                liquor render this at last cloudy, and. thus
                accumulated, there are among them some which effect the
                inversion, without developing moulds, while the
                microzymas undergo a greater or less vibrionian
                evolution. Such is the exact idea to be formed of the
                influence of the creosote, and of the role of the
                atmospheric ferments. When, owing to their presence,
                productions such as moulds are produced, it is because
                die special conditions of existence of these moulds,
                etc., have been realized. But microzymas in their
                function of anatomical elements only become vibrioniens
                from the substance of tissues and humors, ever, in spite
                of the presence of creosote, provided the volume of air
                be limited or completely absent.</i></p>
            <p>These statements and considerations may be summed up in
              the following propositions:</p>
            <p>(1). The microzymas of the animal organism proceed from
              the vitellin microzymas, which are autonomous anatomical
              elements in the vitellus.</p>
            <p>(2). The number of anatomical species of microzymas is
              enormous.</p>
            <p>(3). The essential biological characters of the
              microzymas are to be creators of cellules by synthesis and
              of vibrioniens by evolution.</p>
            <p>(4). The physiological and chemical characters of
              microzymas are to produce the zymases and to be themselves
              ferments having a determined form.</p>
            <p>These propositions are also true for plants beginning
              with the ovule; but from the fact that a microzyma may
              become a vibrionien by evolution, it necessarily follows
              that the species of microzymas being innumerable the
              species of vibrioniens are likewise innumerable.</p>
            <p>It is further important to remember that an anatomical
              element microzyma is animal in an animal, vegetable in a
              vegetable. Hence arises this question: To what kingdom
              belongs the bacterium of such or such an animal microzyma?
              Of such or such a vegetable microzyma? We must remember
              that any microzyma, before it accomplishes the evolution
              which produces a bacterium, passes through the
              evolutionary phases of microzyma slightly changed in form,
              of microzyma successively associated in twos, in threes,
              in several grains, etc. But those forms have been
              described under the names of Monas, of Bacterium termo and
              punctum, of Coccus, of Diplococcus, of Torulo, of
              Streptococcus, of Micrococcus, of Mesococcus, of Microbe
              with a point, of Microbe with a double point, etc. Nor is
              that all; bacteria in spontaneously destroying themselves
              to become microzymas similar to those of the rock-chalk or
              of the artificial chalk of my experiments, have passed
              through new forms, of which the most constant is that
              which has also been described as the Bacterium termo.1</p>
            <p><i>1.&nbsp; See, on this subject, Felix Dujardin, "Les
                Zoophites Infusoire," p. 232.</i></p>
            <p>But what are such specifications worth, based only upon
              the shape, on the length and thickness, upon the color,
              the motility or immotility of the object specified?&nbsp;
              In the order of received ideas it would be too tedious to
              discuss them; it suffices for me to say that Felix
              Dujardin, who knew the germ theory and did not allude to
              it in his explanations, was of opinion that the phenomena
              observed in these changes were favorable to the doctrine
              of spontaneous generation; and consequently that outside
              of the microzymian theory it is all incomprehensible and
              arbitrary. A priori one cannot tell to what kingdom a
              bacterium belongs, for one can only distinguish a
              microzyma, and consequently a bacterium, by the origin and
              function of the microzyma. An example will make this
              clear: Take the parotid gland of a man, and that of a
              horse, the structure and functions of which seem to be the
              same and of which the microzymas of the cellules are
              morphologically identical; well, while the parotidian
              microzymas of man liquify and energetically saccharify the
              starch of fecula, those of the horse liquify that starch
              but do not sac­charify it And we have established by other
              differences of the like kind that the microzymas of the
              different anatomical systems of a same organism may differ
              one from the other; and by still greater reason those of
              different organisms may differ.</p>
            <p>Plants, like animals, being anatomically constituted
              living by their respective microzymas, the bacteria which
              these microzymas can become are evidently limited to the
              two kingdoms; and so perhaps the question whether a
              vibrionien is animal, as was thought, or plant, as is now
              asserted, is an idle one.</p>
            <p>But if one chooses in spite of all this to insist that
              the bacteria are plants and that the microzymas are their
              spores, a new question would arise, of which of the
              species of schizomycetes which the same microzyma may
              become before becoming a perfect bacterium (Bacterium
              termo, Monas crepusculum, torula, Diplococcus,
              Streptococcus, Micrococcus, etc.)—is it first the spore,
              in the organism before evolution, and then in the
              chalk-rock, or in the artificial chalk, after the total
              destruction of the organism?</p>
            <p>According to accepted notions the reply cannot be
              otherwise than uncertain! According to the microzymian
              theory here is the answer.</p>
            <p>An anatomical element, microzyma, in a plant or in an
              animal, whose conditions of existence have just changed,
              can become a bacterium by evolution, and the intermediate
              evolutionary phases, like those of the tadpole, which
              becomes a frog, leaves the special nature of the microzyma
              still existing; there are not new species. The perfect
              bacterium depends on the nature of the microzyma, as the
              perfect batrachian depends on the particular nature of its
              tadpole.</p>
            <p>Every bacterium resolves itself by spontaneous
              destruction into a microzyma, and the microzymas thus
              evolved are different from the anatomical microzyma which
              has become a bacterium, not morphologically, nor
              functionally so far as regards being a figured ferment,
              but by a collection of properties, which assure the
              perennity of the form and of the function in a condition
              of individual separateness.</p>
            <p>But the chief difference consists in this: The anatomical
              element microzyma in the vitellus is the organized
              commencement of all animal organization, and in the ovule
              of the plant it is the commencement of all plant
              organization. On the other hand, the microzyma resulting
              from the destruction of a bacterium is the organized end
              of all organization.</p>
            <p>AND HERE IS SOMETHING STUPENDOUS! The geological
              microzymas, as well as those of the artificial chalk in my
              experiment, are organized and living, not only because,
              without change of form, they are individually figured
              ferments, but also because under certain conditions, such
              as those of the fibrin in the experiment described in the
              first chapter, at the same time that they act as ferments
              they can again become bacteria by evolution. The
              microzymas not only possess the sort of perennity of which
              I spoke; they enjoy also the stupendous duration of the
              geological epochs from the time the microzymian rocks have
              been formed down to the present time. And this duration
              means for us, that the microzymas have been constituted
              physiologically imperishable. And this last statement must
              convince us that the microzymas are organized living
              beings, of a class apart, without analogue.</p>
            <p>And it is thus, precisely because the microzymas are,
              essentially and by destination, autonomous anatomical
              elements in each anatomical system, becoming what they
              ought to become in each, by substantial and functional
              development, parallel with the development of such system
              in the development of the entire organism, that they are
              organized living beings of a class apart as above stated.</p>
            <p>The following is the experimental proof that this new
              principle of anatomy and physiology is well founded.</p>
            <p>The vitellin microzymas of the egg of the fowl do not
              pre-exist in the ovule; they are the result of a
              substantial development, and of the proliferation of the
              ovular microzymas.</p>
            <p>To prove this, it will be sufficient to make the
              elementary analysis of the microzymas of the vitellus of
              the fowl's egg, and of those of the ovules remaining in
              the Graafian vesicle, while these ovules are only a few
              millimetres in diameter. The following are these analyses:</p>

            <p>The difference of two per cent, of carbon in the
              percentage composition answers to great differences in the
              nature of the proximate principles of these microzymas. I
              will add that the vitellin microzymas contain much more
              mineral matter than the ovular. It is thus evident that
              the microzymas of the ovule become vitellin microzymas by
              substantial development, while they multiply and the
              vitellus grows. In short, one may say that the ovular
              microzymas become vitellin microzymas by maturing.</p>
            <p>It would take too long to dwell as long as might be
              desirable on this result and upon the whole of the
              chemical, physiological and anatomical phenomena which
              this ripening necessitates in order that the vitellin
              microzymas should become fitted to play their part,
              chemical, physiological and histogenic, during the
              embryonic development, etc. I must refer the student to
              what I have said elsewhere.1 What is most important to
              bear in mind is, that no matter how high one goes [in the
              scale of living beings] the microzymas are found in the
              ovule, and that these microzymas are not those which are
              to be found in the vitellus, but will become them.</p>
            <p><i>1. See Les Microzymas," etc,&nbsp; pp. 487 and
                following.</i></p>
            <p>All the special facts which I have made known, including
              the last, authorize me in erecting into a general
              principle the precise experimental idea; that the
              microzyma, the final term of the anatomical analysis, is
              in truth the simple anatomical element which satisfies the
              conception of Bichat and completely destroys that of
              living matter not morphologically defined.</p>
            <p>The cellularists, it is but fair to recall, regarding the
              cellule as the simplest anatomical element, believed it
              proceeded necessarily from a former cellule, omnis cellula
              e cellula, holding it to be the vital unit, living per se,
              and regarded an entire organism as the sum of these units.
              But we now know that that was a deduction from incomplete
              and superficial observations, for the cellule, a
              transitory anatomical element, has the microzyma for its
              anatomical element. It is this which alone possesses all
              the characters of an anatomical element, living per se,
              and which must be regarded as the unit of life. It is what
              I have already stated in the following terms:</p>
            <p>"The microzyma is at the beginning and at the end of
              every living organization. It is the fundamental
              anatomical element whereby the cellules, the tissues, the
              organs, the whole, of an organism are constituted living."</p>
            <p>Let us devote a few words to develop this idea. Let us
              penetrate a little further into this notion of a
              fundamental anatomical element, which, as has been said,
              implies that the microzyma is the living atom of the
              organization as the physical atom is the element of the
              molecule of a simple body. This would be true if the
              microzyma were unchangeable in its simplicity. But in
              reality it is essentially mutable, as are all living
              bodies; and it is especially so, in order that it may
              fulfil its numerous functions. In fact, the microzymas,
              functionally different in the different anatomical systems
              of the same species, and different at all ages, beginning
              with the embryonal stage, have been primitively those of
              the vitellus, after having been those of the ovule. A
              microzyma then is not, properly speaking, an atom; but
              always anatomically simple, it becomes, by nutrition, that
              which it needs to become, so as to accommodate itself to
              each new condition of existence which the successive
              phases of the development of each anatomical system
              provide for it. It is thus that even in the embryo, in

                original and at the same time the conception of what the
                eminent author terms the individual coefficient.</i></p>
            <p>When by the attentive study of these facts one has become
              convinced that the microzymian theory is their pure and
              simple expression, it will be at once recognized that the
              cellule is already an organ in which, by nutrition, the
              conditions of the preservation of the microzymas with the
              constancy and regularity of their chemical and
              physiological functions are unceasingly realized. And it
              will thus be understood that the microzymian molecular
              granulations, whether of certain cellules, of the
              vitellus, or of the blood, also realize after their manner
              the conditions of this constancy and regularity. When
              these conditions are no longer realized they may undergo
              vibrionian evolution.</p>
            <p>The most prominent fact in the history of the microzymas,
              that which has been the most disputed, precisely because
              of their capacity to undergo vibrionian evolution, is the
              fact of their anatomical autonomy. Now this faculty, which
              is only manifested when the normal conditions of existence
              of the microzymas, functioning as anatomical elements, are
              no longer fulfilled, is the best proof which could be
              given of the change which has happened in their condition,
              causing their irregular and changed functioning.</p>
            <p>In fact, in their various anatomical situations, the
              microzymas remain morphologically similar to themselves.
              They function in each cellule, in each organ, in each
              anatomical system, naturally, chemically and
              physiologically for themselves while preserving their
              individuality; at the same time that by coordination,
              according to the happy and thoroughly scientific
              expression of Dr. Antoine Cros, they function for the
              benefit of the microzymian molecular granulations of the
              cellules, of the organs and of the various anatomical
              systems taken altogether, whose physiological condition of
              health is preserved by them.</p>
            <p>But if from some etiological cause certain changes happen
              in an organ, changes such as auscultation or percussion
              can precisely ascertain, as, for instance, an increase in
              the volume of the spleen, M. Cross tells us that there is
              a decoordination, a functional perturbation in the entire
              organism and disease. It is worth mentioning that from the
              time Dr. Cros became acquainted with the microzymian
              theory, he did not hesitate to recognize the microzymas as
              the anatomical agents of the decoordination; how does it
              happen?</p>
            <p>Among the causes which produce disease, a sudden chill in
              summer is the one most frequently indicated or invoked.
              The chill is at the same time an influence and a lowering
              of temperature. I do not insist on the fact that it is
              only something living which is painfully affected, so as
              to confine myself to the physical phenomenon. But the
              microzymas are very sensitive to variations of
              temperature; so much so that even the geological
              microzymas act regularly only at temperatures near 40° to
              42 °C. (= 104° to 107° F.); in fact, the microzymas of the
              chalk of Sens do not act so as to cause fecula to ferment
              in a temperature below 38° C. (= 100°.4 F.). Further a
              very slight lowering of the temperature is sufficient for
              the egg which should produce a bird not to produce one,
              and to putrefy or to produce the monsters of Dareste when
              the heat is not uniformly applied. In fact, the influences
              of the medium (as if it should become neutral or acid),
              which modify the activity of the microzymas acting alone,
              are various. That which happens to the isolated microzymas
              happens also to those of the egg and for those of the
              organism. Suppress the air and the egg does not become a
              fowl, but undergoes another kind of change.</p>
            <p>If from any cause whatever the air does not have access
              or has an insufficient access to the pulmonary alveolae,
              and their epithelium becomes the pulmonary tubercle, the
              cellules become reduced to their microzymas, which are
              then found in vibrionian evolution in the tubercle in the
              cretatious state. If the decoordination resulting from an
              irregular functioning of a part of an anatomical system is
              sufficient to bring on a malaise which is not removed,
              there will arise a diseased condition because of a sharp
              change of the conditions of existence of the microzymian
              anatomical elements, and the change in the medium
              sufficient to cause the decoordination will manifest
              itself by the vibrionian and bacterian evolution of the
              microzymas of such or such part of the system. It is thus
              that in the disease called "Sand de rate" (Anthrax), so
              thoroughly studied by Davaine, the diseased microzymas end
              by evolving into what that learned physician called
              bacteridiae, the blood globules undergoing the changes
              which are so characteristic. The bacteridiae were not the
              cause of the diseased condition, but were one of its
              effects; proceeding from the morbid microzymas they were
              capable of inducing this diseased condition in the animal
              whose microzymas were in a condition to receive it. Hence
              it is seen that the alteration of natural animal matters
              is spontaneous, and justifies the old aphorism so
              concisely expressed by Pidoux: "Diseases are born of us
              and in us."</p>
            <p>On the other hand, the disregard of this law of nature,
              the firm establishment whereof is completed by the present
              work, necessarily led M. Pasteur to deny the truth of the
              aphorism, and to imagine a pathogenic panspermy, as he had
              before conceived, a priori, that there was a panspermy of
              fermentations. That M. Pasteur after having been a
              sponteparist should reach such a conclusion was natural
              enough; he was neither physiologist nor physician, but
              only a chemist without any knowledge of comparative
              science.</p>
            <p>What is astonishing is, that he should have succeeded in
              procuring the triumph of a preconceived system among
              physicians and in academies, and to procure the rejection
              of the microzymian theory [without examination. Trans.].
              For instance, an enlightened physician thus summed up the
              fundamental proposition of M. Pasteur: "The microbes
              always come from without; they constitute species which
              remount from generation to generation up to the origin of
              the world."1</p>
            <p>An eminent surgeon, M. Verneuil, ended by admitting as a
              demonstrated theorem that there is no spontaneous tetanus,
              that there is no spontaneous small pox, syphilis,
              glanders, hydrophobia, tuberculosis, charbon or malignant
              pustule; declaring that the pathogenic problem consisted
              solely in discovering how and when the microbe, also
              called virus, come from without, penetrates into the
              organism; declaring that the question is thus stated
              between old medicine and the microbina medicine "with
              extreme simplicity and without the least ambiguity.2a</p>

                found in the statement of Surgeon Verneuil, though
                probably not meant by him, to which assent must be given
                when understood. It is TRUE that there is no such THING
                as tetanus, small pox. syphilis, etc., as is implied by
                the general use of nosological terms. Disease is not a
                thing, an entity: it is a condition, and the error of
                regarding the condition of disease as an entity has
                confirmed, where it has not originated, much of the
                prevailing erroneous treatment of the sick.</i><i><br>
              </i> <i><br>
              </i><i>Nosological terms have a use; it is that of
                bringing to the mind of the physician a group of
                pathological symptoms, which may or may not be present
                in the case of the patient under consideration; from
                them, when present, the diseased condition of the
                patient can be recognized and treated. Unfortunately,
                through not understanding this truth, attempts are
                frequently made to treat, not the patient, but the name,
                which has been given to a collection of morbid symptoms.</i><i><br>

              </i><i>A broken limb is a thing; the inflammation which

                into consideration with all the other symptoms in the
                treatment of the patient. The surgeon, Verneuil, had
                probably a glimmering perception of this truth, but he
                misapplied it, for his theory and practice, as a
                physician, and the theory and practice of nearly all
                modern medicine assume that the condition to be treated
                is a thing having a name and this name is treated
                instead of the patient. — Trans.]</i></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal">But these assertions (of Surgeon
              Verneuil) are reduced to nothing, when we call to mind
              that the pretended germs of the air are only the
              microzymas of organisms which have disappeared, which had
              become bacteria by evolution; that even at the Academy of
              Medicine I said—and no one ven­tured to contradict me—that
              no one had ever been able to reproduce a disease on the
              nosological roll by taking the pretended pathogenic
              microbe in normal air, but only in the diseased animal.
              And I add, that just as with time the fibrin-ous
              microzymas lose the property of decomposing oxygenated
              water so, as proved long ago by Davaine, after a short
              time the blood of an animal which had died of anthrax
              [sang de rate] no longer communicated that diseased
              condition; and the same is true in all cases.</p>
            <p class="MsoNormal">THUS NORMAL AIR NOT ONLY DOES NOT, BUT
              CANNOT, CONTAIN THE PRETENDED PATHOGENIC MICROBES, AND THE
              VERY PRINCIPLE OF MICROBIAN MEDICINE CONSTITUTES A
              FUNDAMENTAL ERROR.&nbsp; </p>
            <p class="MsoNormal">But no attention was paid to this.
              Abandoning the famous dogma of the closure of the body to
              germs from without, it was admitted "that the human
              organism carries constantly a large number of microbes of
              many different species" which only await the moment when
              "the organism being disturbed in its physiological
              functioning will be given over to the activity of its own
              microbes; whose presence it had theretofore borne without
              being affected." M. Jaccond wrote the above [nonsense]
              with reference to two cases of acute pneumonia following a
              chill.1</p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><i>1. "Journal des societes
                scientifiques," 4 May, 1887, p. 156. </i><br>
            </p>
            <p class="MsoNormal">In M. Pasteur's set, M. Jaccond's
              opinion was accepted; and although their master had
              declared that the cellules were not living, his disciples
              imagined that the leukocytes (under the name of
              phagocytes) were living like amoeba and&nbsp; able to
              perform movements called amaeboid. And it was imagined
              that these phagocytes formed themselves into troops to
              pursue and devour the microbes. There was thus a
              phagocytosis,a- which was trumpeted forth as providential.
              The precise knowledge of the blood reduces to its just
              value this latest form of the struggle against the
              microzymian theory. Of all the suppositions and fancies of
              M. Pasteur, there remains only, even for his disciples,
              that which consists in admitting a sole cause, the germs
              or microbes of the air, to explain the phenomena of
              fermentations and disease.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless all physicians did not think as did Verneuil
              or as did M. Jaccond. Before 1866, while the triumph of
              the microbian medicine was in full swing, Dr. A. Tripier
              did not admit that there was a microbe come from without
              to be considered. His attention had been drawn to the new
              opinions by considering how frequently in the classical
              books of medicine a sudden chill led to everything. Here
              is the masterly way in which he explained it:</p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"> <i>[These words must be erased from
                the language of science. Trans.]</i></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal">"It is not at the time when the
              consideration of the individual coefficient tends to take
              a larger and larger place in nosological speculations that
              we must return to a simple etiology which has been rightly
              questioned. I am far from pretending that the savants to
              whom we are indebted for such interesting researches in
              the direction of specific causes design to bring
              everything within it, but those who do not exhibit that
              much prudence must be reminded that to constitute a morbid
              state the concurrence of many conditions are
              indispensable, that however specific it may be, a single
              cause is no cause at all."</p>
            <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;It was thus that M. Tripier
              placed in parallel lines etiology according to the ancient
              medicine and the microbian medicine. I will state later
              the profound meaning of the expression, drawn from
              algebra,a or "individual coefficient". Let us say, at
              first, that it has been supposed that maladies resulting
              from specific causes are poisonings by living matters
              capable of reproducing themselves in the organism. The
              mechanism of these poisonings, says M. Tripier, "has been
              explained in many ways without being permitted to reject
              one on account of another." </p>
            <p class="MsoNormal">"According to M. Pasteur," said he,
              "the multiplication of microbes would be the consequence
              of the introduction of germs introduced from without. For
              M. Bechamp the microbe a1 might proceed from a special
              mode of evolution of living molecular granulations which
              he named microzymas, granulations which exist in all
              protoplasm, the vicious evolution whereof might be
              regarded as causes independent of the introduction of
              leaven of foreign origin."</p>
            <p class="MsoNormal">The radical difference between the
              principle of the microbian medicine and that of the
              microzymian theory of disease is thus clearly expressed.
              The microzymas are not then the cause of disease, but by
              their defective or morbid functional evolution under the
              various influences whereof I have spoken, their evolution
              may become vibrionian. It was only through the ambiguity
              that M. Pasteur succeeded in creating, that M. Tripier was
              able to say that I had admitted that the microbe proceeded
              from the microzyma, and that later M. Jaccond thought that
              the microzymas are the special microbes of the human
              organism.1&nbsp; </p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><i>[a. The term "individual
                coefficient" was first introduced to indicate the amount
                and direction of errors which each individual astronomer

            <i> </i>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><i>[a. The term microbe, introduced for
                the sole purpose of drowning the grand discoveries of

                solecism.—Trans.]</i></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><i>1. This is how the ambiguity was
                created. The surgeon, Sedillot, thoughtlessly invented
                the word microbe as a name for the vibrioniens, which
                eventually Davaine regarded as the living agents of
                disease. M, Pasteur, heedless of the inacurracy, even
                from an etymological point of view of this word applied
                to a microscopic being of immense longevity, adopted it
                to designate the micro-organized ferments; thus beer
                yeast was a microbe, as also the bacteridia of Davaine.
                He went further, and in a book published under his
                auspices he permitted the following definition to
                appear: "Under the name of microscopic beings or
                microbes are meant all living beings too small to be
                seen by the naked eye, all those which can only be seen
                with the aid of instruments which can enlarge them a
                great number of times, such as the small worm called
                trichina, which produces trichinosis, and an acarus,
                which produces the itch..."&nbsp; The work from which
                the above is quoted appeared in 1833 with a preface by
                M. Pasteur. Here we perceive how all diseases are
                regarded as parasitic on the same ground as the itch,
                and how the microzymas have become to be miscalled
                microbes!</i></p>
            <p>To appreciate the antinomy between the microbian system
              and the microzymian theory, and to give to this work its
              practical utility by showing that the theory explains what
              the system is powerless to make clear, it will be
              sufficient to recall the two fundamental facts upon which
              rest the fabric of the demonstration that the blood is a
              flowing tissue, and, like all tissues, is spontaneously
              alterable.</p>
            <p>The first is that a mixture of proximate principles,
              under the specified conditions, is naturally unalterable;
              but on contact with a limited or unlimited quantity of
              common air the same mixture always changes, owing to the
              various ferments which develop in it from the germs
              carried in this air. This mixture then does not alter
              spontaneously.</p>
            <p class="MsoNormal">The second, that a natural animal
              matter, tissue, or humor, withdrawn from a living animal
              in perfect health, and under the same conditions,
              inevitably alters, even when absolutely protected from the
              air and its germs. Natural animal matter then is
              spontaneously alterable.</p>
            <p>It is also desirable to recall: First, that the
              differences in the nature of the two orders of substances
              is such, that in the alteration of the former the
              micro-organisms consist of several categories of different
              species; while in the alteration of the latter only one
              category is to be found, viz., the microzymas, and
              afterwards, most frequently, the vibrioniens, products of
              their evolution; second, that, corroborating the facts,
              creosote in adequate quantity hinders the alteration of
              the former in contact with a limited volume of air,
              preventing the appearance of ferments; while the same
              quantity does not hinder the alteration of the latter,
              nor, in suitable cases, the vibrionian evolution of the
              microzymas.</p>
            <p>Of these two facts M. Pasteur has only regarded the first
              and has denied the second, and it is because he and
              savants who have trusted to his word have looked upon the
              animal body only as organs constituted of a mixture of
              immediate principles—protoplasm—where nothing exists
              capable of becoming a vibrionien, that they have thought
              that the microbe coming from without is the sole cause of
              the alteration of this mixture and of disease. Now if the
              organism were what they think, and the sole cause of
              disease were what they say, a mixture of immediate
              principles necessarily altering an exposure to the air,
              every one would, of equal necessity, become diseased; but
              even in times of epidemics the majority are not attacked!
              An explanation of this fact has been sought in the microbe
              itself and in other considerations of the like order; but
              they are all worthless, for if the air contains that which
              changes the mixture, it does not contain that which causes
              disease.</p>
            <p>The old medicine explained the immunity of the living by
              the receptivity, the predisposition, which those who are
              not attacked do not possess. M. Tripier, more precise,
              invokes the individual coefficient. But a mixture of
              proximate principles which, when exposed to the air, is
              always ready to be altered enjoys no immunity!</p>
            <p>In exact language one can only speak of receptivity of
              the individual coefficient, of that which is regarded as a
              living body. But what is a living body? What is life?</p>
            <p>Life, say some, is a special force, manifesting itself in
              ponderable matter. J. R. Mayer denies this. However it may
              be, they, the former, speak of a physical theory of life.
              We have seen that, according to Pasteur, life is that
              which elaborates the proximate principles, the natural
              substances of which the organism is composed.</p>
            <p>Bichat said: "Life is the totality of the functions which
              resist death." But what is life? What is death? And what
              is the individual coefficient in the microzymian theory?
              For there is no longer any question of protoplasm!</p>
            <p>Bichat said that life was a property of tissue because he
              regarded elementary tissues as the living elements of
              organized beings, which, in his view, possessed in
              themselves a permanent principle of reaction which enabled
              them to resist the causes of destruction which surround
              them.</p>
            <p>The microzymian theory verifies the conception of Bichat
              even on this point; in fact:</p>
            <p class="MsoNormal">The microzyma is the fundamental
              anatomical element, autonomically living, proliferating,
              while remaining morphologically similar to itself. It is
              in reality an apparatus whose functions manifest
              themselves, in a medium which realizes the conditions of
              its existence, by chemical reactions which cause it to
              produce the special zymases depending upon its special
              nature and the various proximate principles varying
              according to the place and the medium where it functions
              in the organism. Isolated from the organism and
              consequently in new conditions, as in the case of fibrin,
              there are some which act like lactic ferment with regard
              to fecula, etc.</p>
            <p class="MsoNormal">In short, the microzymas resist so well
              the ordinary causes of destruction that, in the calcareous
              and other rocks, geological microzymas are to be found,
              now living, which functioned as anatomical elements of the
              animals of the epoch of those rocks. Here then we have the
              organized being, living per se, physiologically
              imperishable, unsuspected until I described
              it.a&nbsp;&nbsp; It is in it alone, functioning as an
              anatomical element, wherein resides the permanent
              principle of reaction which enables the organisms, whereof
              it composes the cellules, the tissues, the organs, to
              preserve themselves by nutrition and resist the
              athmotelluric (Tripier) conditions which</p>
            <p><i>[a. Literally "of which I spoke," but the real meaning
                is as given above in my translation. — Trans.]</i></p>
            <p>unceasingly tend to destroy them. And as there is no
              anatomical element simpler than the microzyma, and none
              other like it, resistant to total destruction, if we call
              life the totality of the anatomical properties which
              render the microzymas constructors of cellules by
              synthesis, and capable of becoming bacteria or vibrios by
              evolution; and the aggregate of the physiological and
              chemical energies which enable them to produce the zymases
              and to nourish themselves by transforming for their own
              use the materials of the medium in the anatomical systems
              wherein they function, eliminating at the same time that
              which they disassimilate after having used it, it must
              surely be admitted that LIFE is, in them allied, it is
              true, to matter, but to the matter in the structured
              organization, morphologically defined, and not simply to
              ponderable matter. So much for the general statement.</p>
            <p>We now know that the microzymas are functionally
              different in the various anatomical systems of the same
              animal, and that they may be functionally different also
              in the same organs of the same structure in man and
              animals. It thence results that it is not always
              permissible in experimenting to draw conclusions from one
              animal to another and least of all to man. So that if we
              could admit with Bichat that life is a property of tissue,
              this property is not the same in all the tissues of the
              same structure and in their microzymas.</p>
            <p>I will endeavour to explain my opinion upon the cause
              which leads to one kind of zymas being produced by one
              microzyma and another kind by another microzyma.</p>
            <p>If there is the life of a microzyma, the life of a
              cellule and that of the organs of an anatomical system,
              there is also the life of the organized WHOLE. This
              necessarily results from the coordinated entirety of the
              particular lives of the organs and I hence of the
              individual lives of the microzymas which function in it.
              It is this view of the functions which Bichat called I he
              entirety of the functions which resist death.</p>
            <p>But if the microzyma is physiologically imperishable,
              what is the death of the living whole? It is the opposite
              of that which constitutes its life, viz.: the absolute
              decoordination of the functions of the microzymas.</p>
            <p>It is thus that in a part abstracted from a living
              animal, muscle or blood, etc., nothing is dead; but the
              microzymas, the only things antonomically living, being in
              decoordination, are no longer in their normal condition of
              existence; they now function only for themselves,
              determining the changes which attend the disorganizations
              of the tissues and the destruction of the cellules."</p>
            <p>Now what is the meaning of the happy expression,
              "individual coefficient," introduced into medical language
              by M. Tripier? As in algebra a quantity is said to be a
              function of another upon which it depends, so in the
              microzymian theory it may be said that an organism, a
              cellule, are quantities which are functions of the
              microzymas which compose it and upon which it depends.
              Thus the expression of coefficient applied to the number
              which multiplies these quantities can be readily
              understood.</p>
            <p>The individual coefficient is the factor which increases
              or diminishes in the microzymas the sum of the energy
              which enables them to resist the various causes which, by
              disturb­ing their functioning, determine morbidity in
              them, and thence disease and death.</p>
            <p>The factor, whatever it may be, being the same, the
              variable, that is to say, the microzyma, differing, the
              result will necessarily vary. Now it is a proven fact, the
              microzymas are functionally different in the species, in
              the races and even in the individual, according to sex and
              age, in the different anatomical systems; the individual
              coefficient then is relative to the functional differences
              of the microzymas of the individual.</p>
            <p>The state of perfect health results from the constancy
              and regularity of the coordinated functioning of all the
              organs the microzymas whereof are anatomically and
              physiologically healthy; for even, in the state of
              coordination, it is necessary to take into account
              heredity, diatheses, atavism, which may in some way have
              affected the particular microzymas of the individual.</p>
            <p>The individual coefficient then is a complex constant
              dependent upon the particular coefficients of such or such
              functional systems of the individual.</p>
            <p>To return to the blood, here is a typical example which
              justifies the above considerations.</p>
            <p>I said that in anthrax (sang de rate) the bacteridia,
              regarded as specific cause, were the result of the vicious
              evolution of the microzymas of the blood, become morbid as
              the consequence of a decoordination, M. Jaccond would say,
              of some disturbance in the physiological functioning of
              the organism. But it is evident that if the interior
              medium were inert or passive, this decoordination, in such
              a mixture of proximate principles, would be an effect
              without a cause, nothing leading it to become disturbed in
              its supposed functioning; for such a mixture has been
              shown to be unalterable of itself; while on the contrary
              it would immediately, infallibly, be placed in a condition
              of alteration determined by the agent, microbe, or
              specific ferment come from without. In short, on the
              hypothesis of a pure interior medium, a mixture of
              proximate principles, for a soil of culture, as it is
              called, for the microbe whose multiplication is poisonous,
              all the sheep would be equally susceptible, especially in
              times of epidemic, to contract anthrax (sang de rate)
              under identical circumstances, by contagion, and in all
              cases by inoculation.</p>
            <p>Well, this does not happen. The adult sheep of the race
              called the African sheep is refractory to anthrax; it does
              not contract the disease by contagion, and generally not
              even by inoculation. The individual coefficient is not the
              same under identical circumstances, for the French sheep
              and for that of Africa. And as proof that the coefficient
              differs according to age, it is enough to state that the
              African lamb is not refractory, while the adult sheep of
              the same race is. Let us then say that the microzymas in
              the blood of the African adult sheep are among those
              which, even when ill treated, do not under­go that vicious
              alteration which would make them become carbuncular; with
              the lambs of the same race it is otherwise.</p>
            <p>If the internal medium were the mixture imagined by
              microbian medicine, the foregoing facts would be incapable
              of explanation. For the medium would be inert and passive;
              since it has been proved that such a mixture is always
              disposed to allow the multiplication of the microzyma or
              of another like specific ferment able to alter it for its
              (the ferment's) own nourishment, and which medium without
              the ferment would be unalterable under other ordinary
              athmotelluric influences, cold, etc. It is the individual
              coefficient in relation to the functional differences of
              the microzymas of the subjects which alone explains the
              immunity of some, the susceptibility of others, since it
              has been demonstrated that in the interior medium there is
              nothing autonomically living, acting and physiologically
              impressionable except the microzymas.</p>
            <p>In the language of the old medicine, immunity,
              susceptibility, is the capacity of the living organism to
              resist an impression, not to undergo, or to undergo the
              influence of external or internal agents. The microzymian
              theory adopts this thoroughly physiological language since
              it is only the microzymas of the living organism which can
              receive im­pressions and suffer or not suffer their
              influence; that is to say, resist or not resist the
              perturbing causes of their func­tioning according as the
              individual coefficient is abnormal or normal.</p>
            <p>But what proof have we of this resistance, and of the
              mechanism of the harmlessness of the microzymas from
              without? The following is one I have given of it.</p>
            <p>The isolated microzyma of beer yeast performs the
              function of a lactic ferment, producing little alcohol; in
              its function of anatomic element in the globule of
              beeryeast it never produces lactic acid. The young yeast,
              vigorous, acting strongly on cane sugar, even in contact
              with the air and with the addition of the chalk whose
              microzymas always effect lactic fermentation, still does
              not produce lactic acid; it resists, and microzymas of the
              chalk when added also fail to produce it. But if the beer
              yeast be old, in some respect altered,a and even protected
              from the air, it will produce lactic acid, and the more,
              if calcareous rock or even pure carbonate of lime has been
              added. There we have the immunity of the beeryeast
              organism and its acquired susceptibility; the immunity
              which enabled it to resist the influence of the microzymas
              of the air and of the chalk, annihilating their influence;
              the susceptibility which enabled these microzymas to
              produce lactic acid without hindering those of the chalk
              in performing their work. Here we have the picture of the
              immunity and of the susceptibility of the microzymas of
              the cellules and of the tissues of the internal medium of
              an animal organism."a1</p>

            <p class="MsoNormal"><i> [a1. We are here presented with a
                forcible illustration of the reckless ignorance of those
                physicians who practice the inoculation of organic
                poisons, such as the products of diseased conditions
                known as vaccines, anti-toxines, etc., upon man and
                other animals, whether as preventives or as remedies.
                Even the changes mentioned in the text, as some of the
                results of the learnedly devised experiments of Prof.
                Behamp, are unknown to these gentlemen; and, absolutely
                ignorant of what effect such inoculations may have upon
                the life forces, i.e., the microzymas of their victims,
                they arrogantly insist that their ignorance is learning,
                and induce a degeneration among those races who,
                recognizing their ignorance, place their faith in men as
                ignorant as themselves! — Trans.]</i></p>
            <p>In microbian medicine the language of the old medicine is
              without meaning, since the former admits that one sole
              cause produces the disease and the alteration by
              fermentation of organic matter in general, making no
              distinction between the internal medium and a mixture of
              proximate principles.</p>
            <p>The insuperable contradiction which exists between the
              microbian doctrines and the microzymian theory of the
              living organization brings into strong relief the justice
              of the aphorism of M. Tripier.&nbsp; A single cause for
              the disease and for the alteration or fermentation of
              proximate principles, however specific it may be, is no
              cause at all (est une cause nulle).</p>
            <p>Yes, "the sole cause" is no cause, for I have
              demonstrated beyond dispute that there do not exist (I do
              not say germs, the word now is unsuitable) pre-existing
              microzymas, pathogenic or not; but there do exist
              microzymas, the living remains of bacteria derived by
              evolution from the anatomical microzymas of organisms
              which have disap­peared or are disappearing beneath our
              eyes.</p>
            <p>I limit here these considerations, referring the reader
              to my earlier publications for developments, which the
              present work completes and corroborates.1</p>
            <p> <i>1. For general pathology, see the three last
                conferences of "Les Microzymas,"etc. For special
                pathology, the communications, "Sur la septicaemic
                puerperale," "Sur la Pleuresie" and "Sur les
                albuminuries," in "Microzymas et Microbes." And for the
                physiological theory of fermentation, as well as for the
                true theory of nutrition, various chapters of the same
                works. (Chamalet, publisher, 60, Passage Choiseul,
                Paris.)</i></p>
            <p>And now I hope it will be confessed that the error,
              common to all contemporary experimenters who have sought
              to discover the cause of the phenomenon of the spontaneous
              coagulation of the blood, also that of other equally
              spontaneous alterations, or who, like M. Pasteur, maintain
              the natural inalterability alike of the blood, as of all
              natural organic matters, is that they have regarded
              protoplasm as a mixture of pure proximate principles, and
              have held as dogma that this mixture was living and
              organized, although not morphologically constituted. At
              last I hope that it will be recognized that the discovery
              of the microzymas verifies the time-honored conception of
              Bichat, according to which, that only is living in any
              organism whatever, which is structured, morphologically
              determinate.</p>
            <p>It is the agreement of the microzymian theory of the
              living organism with the brilliant conception of Bichat
              which gives to the theory of the blood as a flowing tissue
              and to the physiological and anatomical theory of its
              coagulation and other spontaneous alterations their
              highest degree of certainty.</p>
            <p>Under the form of conclusions is here given a succinct
              summary of the totality of the fundamental facts, the
              discovery whereof has led to that of the true anatomical
              and chemical constitution of the blood and to the
              explanation of its spontaneous alterations.</p>
            <p>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ordinary air, near the earth,
              contains living microscopical objects called germs, and
              these germs are essentially microzymas.</p>
            <p class="MsoNormal">(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Proximate
              principles, and any mixture of such principles are
              unalterable in the presence of water, of a limited volume
              of air at ordinary temperature when a little creosote has
              been first added; and such proximate principles under such
              conditions do not permit any organized being to appear.</p>
            <p class="MsoNormal">(3)&nbsp;&nbsp; Natural organic
              matters, vegetable or animal, tissues and humors, under
              like experimental conditions, always change of themselves,
              by a phenomenon of fermentation, and at the same time the
              microzymas, give birth to vibrioniens by evolution.</p>
            <p class="MsoNormal">(4)&nbsp;&nbsp; The fibrin of the blood
              is not a proximate principle; it is&nbsp; a false&nbsp;
              membrane containing microzymas, whereof the
              intermicrozymian gangue is a special­ized albuminoid
              substance.</p>
            <p class="MsoNormal">(5)&nbsp;&nbsp; It is owing to its
              microzymas that fibrin decomposes oxygenated water, that
              it liquifies starch of amidon and that it can be
              dissolved, undergoing chemical change, in very dilute
              hydrochloric acid.</p>
            <p class="MsoNormal">(6)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The microzymas of
              fibrin in liquified starch undergo vibrionian evolution
              notwithstanding the presence of creosote.</p>
            <p class="MsoNormal">(7)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fibrin liquifies
              spontaneously in carbolized water without the microzymas
              undergoing vibrionian evolution.</p>
            <p class="MsoNormal">(8)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fibrinous
              microzymas are special; they can produce lactic and
              butyric fermentation in liquified starch.</p>
            <p class="MsoNormal">(9)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Natural
              albuminoid matters are mixtures, reducible by direct
              analysis into exactly defined proximate principles.</p>
            <p class="MsoNormal">(10)&nbsp; The albuminoid matters
              reduced to proximate principles are very complex molecules
              composed of less complex ones, amides and their
              derivatives of the fatty and aromatic series. There exist
              of such less complex molecules, constituting an albuminoid
              molecule, quaternaries like urea, quinaries like taurine,
              which is sulphuretted; like hematosine, which is
              ferruginous; casein, in addition to the sulphuretted
              molecule, contains one which is phosphuretted; it has then
              six elements.</p>
            <p class="MsoNormal">(11)&nbsp; There are several fibrins
              constituted as are those of the blood.</p>
            <p class="MsoNormal">(12)&nbsp; There are a great number of
              different specific albumens which coagulation does not
              differentiate.</p>
            <p class="MsoNormal">(13)&nbsp; The zymas are special
              albuminoid matters, likewise definable as proximate
              principles; they are always a functional product of the
              microzymas.</p>
            <p class="MsoNormal">(14)&nbsp; The yellow liquid of the
              blood, besides its albumen, contains a haemozymas.</p>
            <p class="MsoNormal">(15)&nbsp; The haemoglobin of the red
              corpuscle, reduced to a definite proximate principle,
              decomposes oxygen­ated water by its noncomplex feruginous
              mol­ecule, haematosine, and becomes colorless. </p>
            <p class="MsoNormal">(16)&nbsp;&nbsp; The red corpuscle of
              the blood is a true cellule, having a cell-wall and its
              proper content. This content is constituted especially of
              haemoglobin and micro-zymian-molecular-granulations, the
              microzymas whereof decompose oxygenated water as do those
              of the fibrin.</p>
            <p class="MsoNormal">(17)&nbsp;&nbsp; The blood contains a
              third anatomical element, the
              haematic-microzymian-molecular-granularions. It is the
              albumenoid atmosphere of these granula­tions which form,
              by allotropic transformation, the intermicrozymian gangue
              of the false membrane called fibrin.</p>
            <p class="MsoNormal">(18)&nbsp;&nbsp; The flowing tissue is
              a content, whereof the vessels, arteries, veins and their
              appendages form the container.</p>
            <p class="MsoNormal">(19)&nbsp;&nbsp; The three orders of
              anatomical elements of the flowing tissue only find their
              conditions of existence complete in their containers
              during life.</p>
            <p class="MsoNormal">(20)&nbsp;&nbsp; After issuing from the
              vessels these conditions of existence being no longer
              fulfilled, the alteration of the flowing tissue commences.</p>
            <p class="MsoNormal">(21)&nbsp; The microzymas of the
              different parts of the circulatory system possess alike
              the property of decomposing oxygenated water without being
              absolutely characteristic of them, for the microzymas of
              almonds and of other parts of plants and of beer yeast
              also possess this property. But there are animal tissues
              whose microzymas do not disengagethe oxygen of oxygenated
              water.</p>
            <p class="MsoNormal">(22)&nbsp; The microzymas, anatomical
              elements, are living beings of a special order without
              analogue.</p>
            <p class="MsoNormal">(23)&nbsp; The spontaneous changes of
              natural animal matters, whether the microzymas have or
              have not undergone vibrionian evolution, thanks to free
              access of air, lead always under certain conditions to the
              complete destruction by oxydation of the product of those
              changes; that is to say, reduce them to the mineral
              condition, carbonic acid, water, nitrogen. But the
              microzymas under whose influence the oxydation is effected
              are not attacked; in such wise that all which is purely
              proximate principle in a tissue, in a cellule and in the
              bacterium, having undergone total destruction, the
              microzymas remain, and bear testimony to the existence of
              the vanished organization.</p>
            <p class="MsoNormal">(24)&nbsp; The geological microzymas of
              certain calcareous rocks and of chalk, those of the dust
              of the streets and of the air also bear testimony to the
              microzymas which functioned as anatomical elements in the
              tissues of organisms of geological epochs even as they
              function in those of the present time.</p>
            <p class="MsoNormal">(25)&nbsp; That which in the air have
              been called germs are essentially the microzymas of the
              entire destruction of a living organism.</p>
            <p class="MsoNormal">(26)&nbsp; Normal air contains neither
              pre-existing germs nor the things which have been
              improperly termed microbes, supposed to ascend from age to
              age to parents resembling them.</p>
            <p class="MsoNormal">(27) The air contains normally no
              pathogenic microzymas. The carbon bacteridium of Davaine
              in the product of the evolution of diseased microzymas,
              either of haematic-microzymian-molecular-granulations, or
              those of the blood globules.</p>
          </div>
          <p class="MsoNormal">(28) There is no living matter which is
            not morphologically defined; that which has been called
            protoplasm in the cellule always contains microzymas as
            anatomical elements.</p>

          <p>[The student is to understand that the above list comprises
            but a small fraction of the scientific work of the late
            Professor A. Bechamp; a fuller list, though still imperfect,
            occupies eight of the large folio pages of the Moniteur
            Scientifique (Paris) for December, 1908, and these labors
            were spread over fifty-three years, from 1853 to 1905
            inclusive. Genius, has been defined as, in one aspect at
            least, the "faculity for taking infinite pains," and this
            faculty was possessed by M. Bechamp in an almost infinite
            degree. The world has yet to learn how much it owes to this
            remarkable genius. The acknowledgment will be resisted by
            all those interests which fatten upon the ignorance and
            trusting confidence of the people. But thanks to his
            researches and discoveries it cannot be long before the
            medical profession will recognise the dangerous errors into

          <b> </b>
          <p>This postface consists of a note read by Professor Bechamp
            before the Academy of Medicine on the 3rd of May, 1870. It
            establishes an important date in the history of science
            during the last three decades of the last century. The
            microbian doctrines were not yet imagined; nor were they,
            till several years after, as a result of the plagiarizing of
            the microzymian theory. </p>
          <p align="center"><b>THE MICROZYMAS, PATHOLOGY AND
              THERAPEUTICS. </b><b><br>
            </b></p>
          <p><b> </b>Chauffard has recently published an important work
            on the treatment of smallpox by carbolic acid. His
            conclusions interest me greatly, and I desired to make the
            matter clear to the Academy. In a note which appeared in the
            Transactions of the Academy of Sciences (Vol LXVI, p.366), I
            said, in reference to a note of Chauveau on the molecular
            granulations of the vaccine virus: </p>
          <p>"From the study and meaning of the molecular granulations
            which are born or act in certain fermentations and which I
            have named microzymas, to the study and meaning of those
            which exist normally in all the tissues of organized beings,
            and also in the cellules of those tissues, was natural. My
            satisfaction, then, was extreme when I saw Chauveau enter
            upon this path, and, from another point of view, confirm the
            observations made in the laboratory of the chemist. I said
            from another point of view; I was wrong, because from the
            physiological point of view where I had placed myself and
            whence I studied what is called fermentation, the
            experiments of Chauveau, on the molecular granulations of
            the vaccine virus, are closely connected with mine. I place
            the molecular granulations in solutions of simple organic
            matters; Chauveau in the organic and organized matters of
            living beings." </p>
          <p>From a time long ago certain diseases have been compared to
            fermentations. We may go back to Stahl and Willis and
            probably still earlier for this, though that is not
            important, for, as was remarked by Babinet, "Antiquity has
            told everything; when it told truly, it was simply a
            wonderful accident, and it proved nothing." </p>
          <p>My researches upon fermentations and ferments, particularly
            upon molecular granulations, date back some fifteen years,
            and those which Professor Estor and I conducted for the
            purpose of generalizing my earlier observations have led to
            this result: that the animal is reducible to the microzyma.
            But the microzyma, whatever its origin, is a ferment; it is
            organized, it is living, capable of multiplying, of becoming
            diseased and of communicating disease. </p>
          <p>All microzymas are ferments of the same order - that is to
            say, they are organisms, able to produce alcohol, acetic
            acid, lactic acid and butyric acid. </p>
          <p>In a state of health the microzymas of the organism act
            harmoniously, and our life is, in every meaning of the word,
            a regular fermentation. In a state of disease, the
            microzymas do not act harmoniously, and the fermentation is
            disturbed; the microzymas have either changed their function
            or are placed in an abnormal situation by some modification
            of the medium. This was what I tried to make clear by a
            positive example of a kind which would leave no room for
            misunderstanding either the extent or the bearings of the
            conclusion. </p>
          <p>The harmonious function of a bird's egg is to produce a
            bird. During incubation the chemical acts which are
            accomplished within it result in the transformation of the
            materials of the yolk and the white into the various
            chemical compounds which will form the various organs of the
            complete animal. </p>
          <p>While these chemical acts are being accomplished, no gases
            other than the normal gases of respiration are set free.
            But, if that which will be the embryo is abstracted from the
            egg, it contains nothing organized but the microzymas. That
            which will be the embryo is itself, at first, only a
            collection of microzymas. From the chemical point of view,
            everything within the egg is the work of the microzymas. </p>
          <p>What will happen if in the egg we proceed to mix up those
            elements within the egg which were not destined to be mixed
            together? Donne said and demonstrated that the egg becomes
            putrid. I am of the same opinion, but this has to be
            explained. </p>
          <p>If, as was done by Donne, everything in the egg is mixed up
            by violent shaking, there is soon observed an escape of
            carbonic acid gas, hydrogen and a trace of sulphuretted
            hydrogen. When the escape of gas has ceased, the contents of
            the egg, from being alkaline as it was before the mixture,
            have become acid; the odor is disagreeable, but gamey only,
            distinct from the horrible odor of rotten eggs, which are
            alkaline. </p>
          <p>If we then examine what has happened to the materials of
            the egg, the albuminoid substances and fatty matters are
            found to be unchanged. The sugar and glucogenic matters have
            disappeared, and in their place we find alcohol, acetic acid
            and butyric acid. What has then taken place has not been a
            putrefaction, but a distinctly characterized fermentation.
            The violent agitation has not killed anything which was
            organized within the egg; only the order of its contents has
            been disturbed. </p>
          <p>The microzymas have been thrown into media which was not
            intended for them; those of the white into the yolk, and
            vice versa. Having been forced to take their nourishment
            from materials not intended for them, they have reacted in a
            new manner, but without any change in their nature or
            appearance. </p>
          <p>I could multiply such examples and show that the same
            microzyma, free or enclosed in a cellule, acts in the former
            condition as a lactic or butyric ferment, in the latter as
            an alcoholic ferment. I have reported the example of what
            happens in the egg because in this instance nothing foreign
            intervenes; fundamentally, the egg is an animal in posse. </p>
          <p>But the microzymas may be regarded from another point of
            view. Not only are they individually ferments, but they are
            also able to produce bacteria. This ability, alike for all,
            does not manifest itself equally for all under the same
            conditions. This amounts to saying that in each natural
            group of beings, and also within each centre of activity
            within each organism, the microzymas possess a certain
            specificity. What I mean is that the microzymas of dogs,
            sheep, birds, etc, and those of the liver, the pancreas, or
            the blood, for instance, although morphologically identical
            in appearance, and even identical in certain aspects
            chemically, are nevertheless different. What is remarkable
            is that the bacterium derived from the microzyma possesses
            the same function as that microzyma; it is a ferment of the
            same order. Not only is the microzyma a builder of the
            bacterium, but it is also a builder of the cellule; but in
            this new condition its functions may be entirely changed.
            The microzymas which are butyric ferment, and which produce
            bacteria which are also butyric ferments, may produce
            cellules which are alcoholic ferments. </p>
          <p>Finally, the microzyma may become diseased and may
            communicate the diseased condition. The first time that my
            attention was called to this subject was in relation to my
            studies of the diseases of the silk worm. On examining the
            eggs of a nursery in which there were many morts-flats, I
            was struck with the presence in these eggs of molecular
            granulations, motile like the others, but more abundant, of
            which a large number seemed united in 2, 3, and 4 grains,
            like the chaplets of microzymas. </p>
          <p>I asked myself if there might not be a relation of cause
            and effect. All the eggs which presented this characteristic
            yielded morts-flats, and those worms which did not die
            produced butterflies which in turn produced eggs possessing
            this same character. Finally, when the disease was at its
            worst, the animal and sometimes the eggs contained bacteria.
            There is then for the silk-worm a characteristic which
            enables one to say, ab ovo, that the caterpillar which will
            be born of this egg will be afflicted with a certain
            disease. I have not yet had an opportunity to study the
            different viruses from this point of view, but there can be
            little doubt that those of smallpox and syphilis contain
            specific microzymas, i.e. they transport the disease of the
            individual from which they originate. These two examples
            have led to the proposal of the specificity of certain
            diseases called infectious. I do not contradict this.
            Nevertheless, when we see that smallpox and syphilis are
            inoculable upon certain animals, and that anthrax is not
            communicable to dogs nor yet to birds, it is certainly right
            to ask wherefore!a </p>
          <p class="MsoNormal"><i>[a. The admirable caution of this true
              man of science is worthy of notice. When almost the whole
              scientific world had gone crazy over belief in the
              "specificity of disease," M. Bechamp says merely: "I do
              not contradict this."&nbsp; The translator is of opinion
              that disease is not an entity—a thing—but a condition, and
              that the opinion of its being an entity is answerable for
              many of the errors of modern medicine. The reasons for his
              opinion will be given on a fitting opportunity. A large
              sect, calling themselves "Christian scientists," deny the
              reality of sickness and say that it is "an error." There
              can be no question but that a large part of the illnesses,
              especially of many wealthy persons, is imaginary only, and
              these can be cured by Christian science, mental healing,
              hypnotic suggestion and the like. I have been unable to
              find any rational foundation for the rest of the claims of
              these sectarians. The desire of so many physicians to
              prevent such persons from attempting to heal those who are
              willing to be treated by them is of the like character to
              the persecutions initiated by Torquenmado and practiced in
              these days by the Russian Church. — Trans.]</i></p>
          <p>Notwithstanding many remarkable works, nothing is more
            obscure than the cause which presides over the development
            of diseases and their communicability. But what we can
            affirm is that when we are sick, it is we who suffer, and
            that the suffering is a cruel reality. This is because the
            cause of our diseased condition is always within ourselves.
            External causes contribute to the development of the
            affliction and hence of the disease only because they have
            brought about some material modification of the medium in
            which live the ultimate particles of the organized matter
            which constitutes us, namely, the microzymas. These external
            causes, by a succession of changes brought about, and
            depending on a crowd of variables, bring about correlatively
            a further change, which then bears precisely upon the
            physiological and chemical status of the microzymas. </p>
          <p>The tendency of the most recent researches is to show that
            miasms, like viruses, contain living microscopic organisms,
            something analogous to microzymas and bacteria, which
            proliferate in the blood or tissues of the animal and make
            it sick. I do not believe that things happen in that manner.
          </p>
          <p>Every phenomenon having a cause, I admit the existence of
            organized particles in miasms, but I do not believe in their
            proliferation in the organism, a proliferation which has
            nowhere been proven, up to the present time, and which many
            experiments positively contradict. Two authors, for
            instance, who agree in regarding the malignant pustule as a
            fermentation and who also agree that the blood of an animal
            attacked by a disease can communicate it to another animal
            of the same species, agree no longer when they endeavor to
            explain what they observe. For Davaine, the virulence of the
            carbuncular blood is due to the species of bacterium to
            which he gave the name of bacteridium. For Sanson, this
            virulence is due to a specific putrid change in the blood.
            According to him, the bacteria have nothing to do with it.
            Often they are not to be found in it; nothing organized can
            even be seen. He even doubts that the bacteria are animals,
            or plants, or even living beings. And the author remarks -
            and this time truly - that putrid albuminoid matter,
            although containing bacteria and even bacteridia, cannot
            communicate anthrax, even to an animal susceptible to it. </p>
          <p>What does all this mean?&nbsp; If neither bacteria nor the
            products of the putrefaction of albuminoid matters
            communicate anthrax? </p>
          <p>I will try to explain these contradictions. </p>
          <p>Davaine made an experiment which I regard as a very
            important one upon this question. He inoculated some very
            parenchymatous plants with some putrid matter of plants, in
            which bacterium termo or something similar to it was
            present. In an opuntia and in an aloe, he said, the bacteria
            propagated while preserving their primitive characters.
            Inoculated from these plants upon another aloe, they gave
            birth to long filaments divided into 2, 3, or 4 articles or
            segments. These long filaments, being innoculated upon a new
            species of aloe, produced corpuscles in a fine powder.
            Lastly the long bacteria, inoculated upon the species of
            opuntia and of aloe, which were the subjects of the first
            inoculations, reproduced the bacterium termo. These facts
            cannot be disputed. The authority of Davaine guarantees
            them, but their interpretation seems to me to be open to
            question. </p>
          <p>On the other hand, when I examined the frozen parts of
            several species of plants (belonging to various families),
            in which previous to the congellation there had been no
            lesion whatever, I always found bacteria of several kinds,
            not to say species, according to the specific nature of the
            frozen plant, and in the healthy parts, adjacent to the
            latter, there was not a trace of bacteria; nothing but
            normal microzymas. This proves that bacteria can develop in
            plants without inoculation, just as they can develop and
            even exist normally in man throughout the entire length of
            the digestive canal. </p>
          <i> </i>
          <p style="background: white"><i>[a "Individual aptitudes,"
              that is, in she altered medium, abnormal and therefore
              diseased, and productive of a diseased condition, but not
              necessarily that of the inoculated matter. — Trans.]</i></p>
          <p>I would then explain the experiment of Davaine by saying
            that by the wound and the introduction into this wound of
            certain bacteria and of the liquids which saturate them,
            this savant produced a lesion and a change of medium which
            permitted the normal microzymas of the inoculated plants to
            evolve according to their own individual aptitudes,a and
            there was no proliferation of the inoculated bacterium. </p>
          <p>It is the same with animals. It is not the inoculated
            organisms which multiply, but their presence and the liquid
            which saturates them causes a change in the surrounding
            medium which enables the normal microzymas of the organism
            to evolve in a diseased manner, either reaching or not
            reaching the state of a bacterium. The disease is not the
            consequence of the new mode of being of the normal
            microzymas; the fever which ensues is only the result of
            this new method of functioning and of the effort of the
            organism to rid itself of the products of an abnormal
            fermentation and disassimilation, while inducing a return of
            the diseased microzymas to the physiological condition. </p>
          <p>This theory, which is founded upon facts ascertained by
            indisputable experiments, explains, among other things, why
            the blood of carbuncular sheep containing bacteridia
            inoculated upon dogs or birds does not induce the appearance
            of bacteridia and the development of the carbuncular
            disease, as Davaine has shown. But is there any difference
            in the purely chemical materials of the blood of a dog, a
            bird and a sheep? They contain the same albuminoid and other
            matters, the same salts, the same fatty bodies, and under
            other conditions, the microzymas found there certainly
            evolve into bacteria. The only difference which exists, as
            is proved by the experiment itself, must be in the
            histological elements of the blood of these animals and in
            their unequal susceptability. If then the bacteridae
            inoculated upon birds and dogs do not multiply as they
            should have done, it is certainly not that the chemical
            medium is different; and if anthrax does not result from the
            inoculation, it is because the microzymas of these animals
            are unfit to evolve morbidly under the influence of the
            medium which promotes the introduction of morbid materials.
          </p>
          <p>To sum up, the microzymas are organized ferments, and they
            can under favorable circumstances produce bacteria. Under
            other circumstances they become builders of cellules. All
            organisms, ab ovo, are created by them. In short, the
            cellule, the bacterium itself, can rebecomea a microzyma,
            and thus the microzymas are seen to be the beginning and end
            of all organization. If that is true, we ought to encounter
            them wherever organized beings have lived; and the fact is
            that I have found them in all the calcareous rocks from the
            oolithic to the most recent; the dusts of our streets swarm
            with them, and there as everywhere they are ferments of the
            same order. Not all of them are morbid. If they were, we
            would be living under a constant menace; but there may be
            morbid ones among them. </p>
          <p style="background: white"><i>[a. Would it not be more
              agreeable to the facts discovered by Prof. Bechamp to
              regard the much smaller microzymas which result from the
              final evolution, as the actual offspring of the parent
              microzymas via the bacteria, like the butterfly from its
              parent butterfly via the chrysalis? - Trans.]</i></p>
          <p>What relation is there between the above and the work which
            I recalled at the commencement? </p>
          <p>The following: </p>
          <p>It is now a long time, from the beginning of my researches
            upon ferments at a time when nobody occupied themselves with
            the question of spontaneous generation, since I demonstrated
            (in opposition to generally received ideas) that creosote
            (and phenic acid, for at this time this acid was sold as
            creosote, especially in France), in a non-coagulating dose,
            did not impede a fermentation that had already commenced. I
            showed that in the same dose, these agents prevented the
            appearance of organized ferments in the most fermentiscible
            mixtures. And I gave as explanation for this the fact that
            they opposed the germination or hatching of the germs of
            microphytes or microzair ferments which the air might bring
            to the mixtures, thus confirming an old experiment of Humer,
            recalled by Chevreul, and precisely proved by that savant,
            i.e. that the vapors of the essence of turpentine, in a
            confined space, hindered the germination of seeds and caused
            the destruction of those which had begun to germinate. I
            also demonstrated that the same doses of these agents did
            not hinder fresh muscle from acting on fecula starch, to
            liquify and to cause it to ferment, nor finally the
            appearance of bacteria in the mixture. I concluded from this
            that the muscle must contain ferments already developed,
            living, and active of themselves, since creosote did not
            prevent the fermentation from beginning. This observation
            was the point of departure for the researches that Estor and
            I undertook upon the evolution of the microzymas of the
            higher organisms into bacteria. In ending my earliest
            observations, in 1866, I advised the use of creosote and
            phenic acid in the rearing of silk worms, for the purpose of
            preventing the birth of the vibrating corpuscle, which is
            the vegetable parasite of the pebrine. </p>
          <p>At the same period Dr. Masse, starting from the same point
            of view, employed the same agent to dry up the fecundity of
            the spores of the microsporon mentagrophytes of parasitic
            sycosis. </p>
          <p>In 1868 my friend, Dr. Pecholier, inspired by similar
            ideas, published his researches regarding the treatment of
            typhoid fever by creosote; he proposed to prevent the
            appearance and multiplication of the typhoid ferment. Later
            Gaube published a work in confirmation of that of Dr.
            Pecholier. The same year Calvert reported the experiments
            made at Mauritius by Drs. Barrault and Jessier on the
            application of phenic acid in the treatment of typhoid and
            intermittent fevers. </p>
          <p>The above is the connection of the ideas and origin of the
            employment of creosote and carbolic acid in therapeutics.
            The theory of this employment is as follows: </p>
          <p>Creosote dries up the fecundity of the germs which produce
            disease,a in conformity with the principles enunciated by me
            in 1857. The following experiment, while maintaining the
            principle, gives it a wider meaning and places it in
            connection with the first parts of this discourse. </p>
          <p><i>[a. Diseased conditions. -- Trans]</i></p>
          <p>Beer yeast is a complete organism, though reduced to the
            state of a simple cellule. As an alcoholic ferment, in a
            sugared medium it preserves indefinitely its cellular form.
            But under other conditions, things happen differently. Beer
            yeast, it has been said, does not cause starch to ferment;
            that is an error; it causes it to ferment, but in a
            different manner to sugar--- that is all. If it is
            introduced into starch of fecula, with some very pure
            calcic-carbonate (not from the calcareous rocks), the whole
            being creosoted to hinder the influence of germs of the air,
            the starch will be liquified, a fermentation will be set up
            and the yeast disappears by degrees and is finally replaced
            by an innumerable quantity of superb bacteria. The
            fermentation is acetic, lactic and butyric instead of being
            alcoholic. It may be said that it was the bacteria which
            were the ferments; granted, but observe that these bacteria
            are the issue of the beer yeast, of its microzymas. That
            settled, in other experiments, the same quantities of yeast,
            calcic carbonate and starch being employed, and double and
            triple the quantity of creosote, the starch was still
            liquified, and the fermentation proceeded, but the globules
            of yeast were not destroyed, and the bacteria did not
            appear. The yeast was not killed; the creosote when used in
            greater amounts has only prevented the evolution of the
            microzymas into bacteria. </p>
          <p>Creosote, which resists the blossoming of the germs of
            microphytes and microzoairs in fermentiscible media,
            preventing thus the commencement of fermentation, does not
            hinder a fermentation already commenced and where there
            exist already adult organisms. But in certain doses it is a
            moderating agent which, according to the experiments just
            mentioned, regulates the function of the cellule and its
            microzymas, which it prevents evolving into bacteria. </p>
          <p>The explanation of the role of carbolic acid and creosote
            in therapeutics is easy to understand, if account is taken
            of the researches which have permitted this hasty resume to
            be made. These agents do not hinder the physiological
            functioning of the histological elements of the organism,
            but they arrest the morbid evolution of the microzymas, the
            too rapid destruction of the cellules, and tend, doubtless
            by modifying the medium, to bring back into harmony the
            functioning of the deviated microzymas. </p>
          <p>This recalls unavoidably the agents used in the old
            therapeutic devices which our ancestors employed; camphor,
            essences, musk, etc. It is true that it was empirically that
            they fulfilled the indications which, after many deviations,
            we now supply like them, but instead we use new methods
            which rely on experimental and positive data.a </p>
          <p style="background: white"><i>[a. This expression, and some
              statements in the parts of this "postface" immediately
              preceding it, have been cited by microbiologists to
              support the assertion that M. Bechamp believed in the germ
              theory of disease. Such a statement illustrates a
              consciousness of the weakness of their position and their
              eagerness for calling in aid occasional expressions of
              their opponents. The truth is that the word "germ" is used
              in a fast and loose way by the microbists, and there is a
              meaning in it which it might be said that "germs" have
              produced this or that diseased condition. All which serves
              to show the importance of exactness in the use of
              language, a fact rarely borne in mind or carried into
              practice by these savants. It would be out of place to
              enter into a disquisition hereon here; besides the theory
              itself is destined to fall, "with a great bursting of
              bubbles." so soon as the writings of Prof. Bechamp become
              widely known. His "Microzymas et Microbes," and his
              designation of the microbian theory in "Les grands
              problemes medicaux." p. 11 ,as "La plus grande sottise
              scientifique de ce temps," sufficiently indicate his
              opinion. — Trans.]</i></p>
          <p>And, in conclusion, I beg the permission of the Academy to
            repeat here something which Professor Estor and I said in a
            recent work upon this subject: </p>
          <p>"After death (leaving here the domain of pathology to enter
            into that of the physiology of the species), it is essential
            that matter be restored to its primitive condition, for it
            has only been lent for a time to the living organized being.
            In recent years an extravagant role has been assigned to the
            airborn germs; the air may bring them, it is true, but it is
            not necessary that it should do so." </p>
          <p>The microzymas, whether in the state of bacteria or not,
            are sufficient to assure by putrefaction the circulation of
            matter. </p>
          <p>The living being, filled with microzymas, carries in itself
            the elements essential for life, disease, death and
            destruction. And that this variety in results may not too
            much surprise us, the processes are the same. Our cellules,
            it is a matter of constant observation, are being
            continually destroyed by means of a fermentation very
            analogous to that which follows death. Penetrating into the
            heart of these phenomena we might really say, were it not
            for the offensiveness of the expression, that we are
            constantly rotting!<br>
