      </center>
      <p>This invention relates to so-called gravitational isotopes and
        their beneficiation and to control devices utilizing the
        beneficiated isotopes. </p>
      <p>The invention and the practical results thereof subscribe to
        the postulate of the non-equivalence of gravitational mass and
        inertial mass. </p>
      <p>A gravitational isotope is that fraction or constituent of a
        sample of an element having the same inertial mass but a
        different gravitational mass than the balance of the sample.
        Such isotopes may be either lighter or heavier (gravitationally)
        than the normal composition but will have approximately the same
        inertial mass as the normal composition. The term "gravitational
        isotope" as used herein is not to be confused with the term
        "inertial isotopes" commonly referred to in physics merely as
        "isotopes". Every known method of separating particles of the
        same element, which differ only in inertial mass from other
        particles of the element, utilizes a difference in inertial
        response to separate these particles. One example of these known
        types of methods is the use of the mass spectrograph in which
        uniformly charged particles are projected into an electrical
        field and separate due to difference in inertial mass. </p>
      <p>These heavier or lighter atomic isotopes are heavier or lighter
        only in the gravitational sense, in that they react differently
        to the force of gravitation. Hence, their gravitational mass, as
        distinguished from their inertial mass, is different. In other
        words, and as usually expressed, the weight-to-mass ration is
        different; but it is to be understood that the mass so referred
        to is inertial mass. In making this distinction, it is also
        important to understand that it must be the inertial mass which
        is equated to energy, as E = mc2. </p>
      <p>In the various gravitational isotopes referred to, the
        weight-to-mass ratio is different from one isotope to another,
        as well as from the raw material from which the isotopes are
        extracted. It is believed that this ratio varies from one pure
        gravitational isotope to another in steps which are exact
        multiples of uniform whole numbers; hence, the use of the word
        "isotope", meaning "same place". In general, the total inertial
        mass of the gravitational isotopes is approximately the same as
        the inertial mass of the sample as a whole, though there may be
        some differences. In some cases there appears to be an inverse
        relationship, with a very slight increase in inertial mass
        accompanying a large decrease in gravitational mass. </p>
      <p>The weight-to-mass ratio of a wide variety of natural
        terrestrial materials, according to the investigations of Oetvos
        and others, appears to be unity for low values of gravity and
        centrifugal force, such values being those due to the surface
        gravity and rotation of the earth on its axis. These results,
        having been derived from experiments of great accuracy, were
        subsequently accepted as grounds for the Postulate of
        Equivalence, upon which the General Theory of Relativity was
        based. It is to be pointed out, in connection with a better
        understanding of the present invention, that the equivalence of
        mass and weight must be presumed to be valid only for
        comparatively weak fields, and that the law governing the
        relationship must be non-linear. Such non-linearity would result
        in observable non-equivalence as the divergence is increased due
        to the use of high or ultra-high centrifugal forces. </p>
      <p>Briefly, in accordance with aspects of this invention, raw
        materials such as silica (cristobalite, tridymite, quartz,
        silver sand or vitreous silica) containing gravitational
        isotopes of silicon are finely subdivided, such as by grinding,
        to the desired size; for example, of the order of 40 microns.
        The silica or other material is then introduced into a fluid
        having a density such that a portion of the material just floats
        and the remainder settles to the bottom; for example, a density
        of 2.65. </p>
      <p>Examples of such fluids are thallium formate or thallium
        malonate which may be diluted to the desired density by mixing
        with a fluid of lower density, such as water. Thallium formate
        alone has a density of approximately 4.0 as compared with water
        and by mixing with distilled water, any desired density between
        1.0 and 4.0 may be obtained. Another example of such a fluid is
        acetylene tetrabromide, which has a density of approximately 3.0
        as compared with water. Acetylene tetrabromide may be diluted
        with ether or alcohol until the desired density is obtained. </p>
      <p>The next step is to separate the portion of the material which
        floats in the fluid having a density of 2.65 from that which
        sinks in the fluid. This can be done by any convenient means,
        such as decantation. </p>
      <p>If it is desired to isolate the lighter gravitational isotopes
        of silicon from the heavier, then the silica from the decanted
        portion is introduced into a centrifuge containing a fluid of
        the same density (2.65 in the example given) as that employed in
        the immediately previous settling step. At this point, the
        pulverized silica "just floats". The centrifuge is now operated
        with a sufficient speed of rotation to cause a portion of the
        floating material to sink toward the outer end of the centrifuge
        tube in spite of the enormously increased buoyancy of the field
        due to hydrostatic pressure. It is that portion of the material
        containing the lighter gravitational isotopes which is thrown
        outward in the centrifuge. The reason for this is explained
        later. The tube is then frozen, the centrifuge stopped and the
        material from the outer end of the tube is cut away and removed.
        It must be understood that if the fluid in the tube is not
        frozen while the centrifuge is still running, so as to hold the
        material in place, the material which has sunk to the end of the
        tube will again rise to the surface as the inertial forces are
        weakened and the gravitational forces again predominate. Any
        means for removing the materials continuously, while the
        centrifuge is operating, will serve the same purpose. </p>
      <p>The sedimentation step is now repeated with the material from
        the outer end of the centrifuge tube in a fluid which has a
        slightly lower density than the fluid employed in the first and
        second steps. For example, if the fluid employed in the first
        and second steps has a density of 2.65, then the fluid employed
        in the third step may have a density in the order of 2.5 </p>
      <p>That portion of the material which floats plus that in the
        upper layer of the precipitate is retained and introduced into a
        centrifuge tube containing a fluid. In this instance, the fluid
        in the centrifuge tube is adjusted to a greater density than the
        fluid employed in the previous centrifuge step, say 3.0, which
        now causes allthe material to float. </p>
      <p>The centrifuge is again operated and after a period of time the
        fluid is frozen. The centrifuge is then stopped and the material
        is cut away and removed from the bottom of the centrifuge tube.
        Alternate settling and centrifuging steps are repeated until the
        required amount of gravitational isotopes is separated. Each
        successive step yields a smaller and smaller fraction of
        respectively lighter and lighter isotopes. </p>
      <p>The end-produce of the last step will be a material which is
        gravitationally very much lighter than an equal number of
        particles of the average initial material (or the material which
        settled at the bottom in the first sedimentation step). If
        gravitational isotopes heavier than the normal composition are
        desired, the opposite fractions are retained in each step of the
        process. The stages of beneficiation may be repeated until a
        suitable amount of gravitational isotopes of each fraction is
        obtained. Each fraction so isolated is characterized by a
        specific weight-to-mass ratio which progressively increases or
        decreases with each stage. </p>
      <p>It is to be noted that, in the first sedimentation step and in
        the first centrifuging step, the fluid employed had the same
        specific gravity. In each subsequent sedimentation step where it
        is desired to separate progressively lighter gravitational
        isotopes, fluid of a progressively lower specific gravity is
        employed, while in each subsequent centrifuging step, fluid of a
        progressively higher specific gravity is employed. For example,
        if the first stage fluid had a specific gravity of 2.65, the
        second stage sedimentation step might employ a fluid of specific
        gravity 2.5 and the second stage centrifuging step might employ
        a fluid of specific gravity 3.0. The third sedimentation step
        might employ a fluid of sp. Gr. 2.1, while the third
        centrifuging step might employ a fluid of sp. Gr. 3.5. </p>
      <p>Where it is desired to separate progressively heavier
        gravitational isotopes from the raw material, fluids of
        progressively higher specific gravity are employed in each
        subsequent sedimentation step and fluids&nbsp; of progressively
        lower specific gravity are employed in each subsequent
        centrifuging step. </p>
      <p>Briefly, in accordance with this novel method for separating
        gravitational isotopes, two buoyancy or hydrostatic balancing
        steps are utilized -- one employing gravitational forces
        (settling) and the other employing inertial forces
        (centrifuging). In each step, the forces acting directly upon
        the material are balanced, or at least largely offset, by the
        buoyancy due to hydrostatic forces causes by forces acting on
        the fluid. This is the well known principle of the hydrometer.
        Where the fluid responds equally to gravitational and inertial
        forces, as when its weight-to-mass ratio is unity, material
        balanced in the first step will remain equivalently balanced in
        the second step (at high centrifugal speeds) only if it also has
        a weight-to-mass ratio of unity. Any departure from unity will
        create an unbalance during the second step which will cause that
        fraction containing the anomalous material to float or sink (as
        the case may be) in the centrifuge tube. This process may be
        termed "differential centrifugal hydrometry". </p>
      <p>Hence, it will be readily seen that those materials possessing
        a weight-to-mass ration near unity, which presumably constitute
        the bulk of natural terrestrial materials, will not forcibly
        separate in the centrifuge step. If such material "just floats"
        in the gravitational situation, it will continue to "just float"
        in the inertial situation even at ultra-high centrifugal speeds.
        If it has sunk gravitationally, it will continue to stay at the
        bottom during centrifuging. Only those materials or fractions of
        materials having weight-to-mass ratios other than unity, that
        is, containing gravitational isotopes, will be hydrostatically
        unbalanced and will move to the opposite end of the tube during
        centrifuging. </p>
      <p>One important feature in the present invention is the
        centrifugal hydrometric balance as described above. It is
        somewhat dependent upon the use of a fluid possessing a
        weight-to-mass ratio of unity, although the effects of a
        departure from unity, if known precisely, can be compensated.
        The purpose of alternate settling steps is largely to provide
        rough selection and to rid the system of "tailings" as rapidly
        as possible. </p>
      <p>In the case of materials containing lighter gravitational
        isotopes there is, in most instances, a spontaneous evolution of
        energy in the form of light, heat, etc., not due to
        radioactivity or chemical or bacterial action. Usually, none of
        such materials is radioactive in the accepted sense or subject
        to spontaneous chemical or bacterial decomposition.
        Nevertheless, such materials are nearly always warmer than their
        environment. </p>
      <p>Conversely, in the case of materials containing heavier
        gravitational isotopes than the environment, there is continuous
        absorption of heat and usually a temperature lower than the
        ambient. </p>
      <p>The cause of these thermal effects is not known. One hypothesis
        holds that a high ration of inertial mass to gravitational mass
        is coexistent with a high energy level (excited state) in the
        material, and this results in a spontaneous release of energy to
        the environment. The activity of such materials decays with
        time, presumably as the energy level approaches that of the
        surroundings. This loss of energy results in a gradual lowering
        of the mass-to-weight ration of the material (eventually) to
        unity. </p>
      <p>A more recent extension of this hypothesis, possibly useful in
        understanding the present invention, suggests that matter may
        contain certain minute but significant quantities of anti-matter
        in metastable equilibrium. Anti-matter is conceived as having
        positive inertial mass but negative weight; hence, its presence
        in (ordinary) matter would alter the mass-to-weight ration.
        Immediate annihilation of one form of matter by the other would
        be prevented in the natural state by the isolation or
        compartmentation of the anti-matter in "cells" bound by electric
        (Helmholtz) double layers and gravitational repulsion barriers.
        The comparatively infrequent and random annihilations, possibly
        due to the loss of equilibrium or rupture of "cells" may
        therefore account for the radiated energy and the phenomenon of
        slow decay. </p>
      <p>Most of the raw materials investigated (containing lighter
        gravitational isotopes) are characterized by being measurably
        warmer (0.002-0.005° C) than their surroundings. These raw
        materials are further characterized by a small but definite
        retardation in gravitational acceleration, i.e., a lower value
        of g in free fall. Some of the known raw materials are aluminum
        silicate, cobalt-nickel silicate, barium aluminate, beryl
        crystal (comprising pure beryllium aluminum silicate), and beryl
        ore (containing crude barium aluminum silicate). The invention
        is not, however, limited to these compositions or the isotopes
        of aluminum or silicon but includes other elements or materials
        in general which contain gravitational isotopes. </p>
      <p>The fractions of lighter or heavier gravitational isotopes in
        natural materials are very small and beneficiation in the form
        of concentration or refinement is necessary for commercial
        utility. </p>
      <p>The different isotopes separated by the above method may be
        utilized to provide a gravity-sensitive element or an
        acceleration-sensitive element comprising two masses tending to
        counter-balance each other. In each case, at least one of the
        masses includes a gravitational isotope or a substance having
        the same inertial mass as the normal substance but having a
        different weight. In the gravity-sensitive device (which is
        insensitive to acceleration), the two opposing masses have the
        same inertial mass but different gravitational masses. In the
        acceleration or inertial-sensitive device&nbsp; (which is
        insensitive to gravity), the two masses have the same
        gravitational mass but different inertial masses. </p>
      <p>For convenience, both positive and negative acceleration forces
        and centrifugal force will be characterized as acceleration or
        inertial forces. </p>
      <p>The illustrative control devices are particularly useful when
        it is necessary to make the device insensitive either to gravity
        or inertial forces while being sensitive to the other. In aerial
        navigation, such as the control of guided missiles or the like,
        which may travel very far from the earth, certain controls
        depend upon the establishment of a "stable vertical" with
        reference to the earth and the vector of gravity, and which are
        independent of or insensitive to disturbances introduced by
        inertia. Other controls must be responsive to inertial forces
        without being influenced by the earth's gravitational field. One
        means for attaining the foregoing objects is to employ systems
        which are balanced wither with respect to gravitational forces
        or to inertial forces (so as to be insensitive thereto) without
        being balanced with respect to the other force. One type of such
        control device is illustrated in the drawing. </p>
      <p>Another novel form of force-sensing device utilizes a mass
        differential (either gravitational or inertial) between a solid
        member and the fluid in which the member is immersed. When the
        member and the fluid have the same inertial mass but different
        gravitational mass, the device is sensitive to gravity while
        being insensitive to inertial forces. Conversely, when the
        member and the fluid in which it is immersed have the same
        gravitational mass but different inertial mass, the device is
        sensitive to inertial forces while being insensitive to gravity.
        To achieve these differences in mass, gravitational isotopes may
        be included in the solid member or in the fluid depending on the
        unbalance desired and the particular gravitational isotope
        employed. </p>
      <p>The device in this form has the advantage of being quite simple
        mechanically, self-compensating and free from fulcrum or pivot
        adjustment. The strength of the mechanical suspension of the
        immersed movable member or members need only be sufficient to
        handle the differential forces which the device is designed to
        sense. The presence of the fluid also provides desirable
        damping. </p>
      <p>In the illustrative method of concentration or refinement, the
        first step is to obtain a selective gravitational separation or
        settling of the raw material containing gravitational isotopes.
        Generally, such materials will contain, in addition to the
        normal composition and its gravitational isotopes, foreign
        materials or impurities differing widely from the aforesaid
        composition in specific gravity. Preferably, the material is
        pulverized so that in some particles there will be a greater
        than average concentration of such isotopes. Generally, methods
        employed in ore dressing for selectively gravitationally
        separating powdered materials of different weight, may be
        employed; although, because of the generally small difference in
        specific gravity between normal compositions, even with various
        amounts of isotopes as they occur in nature, the most sensitive
        separating methods should preferably be employed at least in the
        initial separating steps. </p>
      <p>One illustrative method includes the step of floating and/or
        settling the material from a fluid, such as thallium formate or
        acetylene tetrabromide, as mentioned above. However, if the
        material be ground very fine or be of low gravity, a less dense
        fluid, such as a gas, may be used in order to induce a more
        rapid settling. Very fine grinding (e.g., minus 325 mesh, i.e.,
        43 microns) has the advantage of producing a greater difference
        in gravity between the particles of the same size, but the
        disadvantage of slower settling and the greater influence on
        results if the particles differ substantially in size. </p>
      <p>Upon completion of the gravitational separating process, there
        will be a greater concentration of heavy material in the lower
        portion of the layer of settled material than in the upper
        portion. At least in the initial separating steps there will be
        no sharp division between heavier and lighter materials, but
        merely a gravitational (density) gradient from the lower to the
        upper portions of the layer of settled materials. In the case
        of&nbsp; compositions containing lighter gravitational isotopes,
        the flotage and/or the upper portion of the layer is retained.
        How much of the layer is retained may depend on the degree of
        difference in weighs of material from top to bottom of the
        layer; but, if one retains simply half the layer each time, it
        is evident that in five settling steps (with intervening
        centrifuging explained below in greater detail) the final
        fraction will comprise 1/1024 (roughly 0.001) of the original
        material and will, theoretically, contain about 1000 times the
        concentration of gravitational isotopes occurring in the
        original material. </p>
      <p>The flotage and retained upper layer of material will comprise
        a mixture of lighter gravitational isotopes and normal matter
        having about the same specific gravity as the isotopes. A rough
        separation between the isotopes and the normal matter is then
        effected by inertial forces, as by centrifuging while
        hydrostatically balanced. Normal matter, having a mass-to-weight
        ratio equal to the supporting fluid, presumably unity, is not
        influenced and remains floating or largely in suspension. The
        lighter gravitational isotopes, on the other hand, having a
        mass-to-weight ratio greater than the supporting fluid are not
        proportionally balanced even by the tremendous increase in
        buoyancy accompanying the high centrifugal forces and thus are
        made to sink. During centrifuging, a greater number of lighter
        isotopes will thus be found in the outer layer (bottom) of the
        centrifuge. The normal matter, including the heavier
        gravitational isotopes, will continue to float or be more
        concentrated in the inner layer. In batch beneficiation, the
        centrifuge tubes or containers of fluid may be frozen while the
        centrifuge is in operation. This prevents remixing of the
        materials when the inertial forces causing the separation are
        withdrawn. In certain cases, impaction of the material
        containing the greater concentration of isotopes may be
        sufficient to prevent remixing when the centrifuge is stopped.
        In such cases, freezing may not be necessary. </p>
      <p>In continuous beneficiation, the material is removed
        continuously from the inner and outer layers of the centrifuge
        while it is operating. Where lighter isotopes are being
        separated, material in the inner layer may be discarded, and
        that in the outer layer retained. The latter will comprise some
        of the normal material mixed with a greater concentration of
        lighter gravitational isotopes (about twice where half the
        settled layer is retained each times) than in the original
        material. </p>
      <p>The aforesaid sequence of settling and centrifuging steps is
        then repeated as often as is necessary to secure the desired
        beneficiation or concentration. As the isotopes become more
        concentrated, different settling methods may be employed if
        there be a substantial difference in weight between the isotopes
        and the remaining material (referred to as gangue in ore
        dressing). </p>
      <p>Accordingly, it is a feature of this invention to separate the
        gravitational isotopes of an element by the steps of floating
        and/or settling the isotope containing material in a fluid and
        differentially hydrometrically centrifuging the material
        obtained from one layer of the material in the flotation or
        sedimentation stage. </p>
      <p>It is another feature of this invention to alternately employ
        the steps of floating and/or settling an isotope containing
        material in a fluid and differentially hydrometrically
        centrifuging selected materials from the flotation or settling
        stage to separate different isotopes of the selected materials.
      </p>
      <p>It is an equivalent feature of this invention to separate
        materials of anomalous mass-to-weight ratio from normal
        materials by utilizing differential centrifugal hydrometry as
        described. </p>
      <p>It is another feature of this invention to utilize members
        having different gravitational masses and equal inertial masses
        to provide a stable vertical device. </p>
      <p>It is another feature of the invention to utilize members
        having different gravitational masses and equal inertial masses
        to provide a gravity measuring device which would be free from
        the disturbing influences of acceleration, such as an airborne
        gravity meter. </p>
      <p>It is another feature of this invention to employ a plurality
        of members having equal gravitational masses and unequal
        inertial masses to provide an accelerometer which is independent
        of gravitational forces. </p>

      <p>The gravitational separating step is represented in <a
          href="#0fig1a">Figure 1A</a> by the chamber 10 containing a
        fluid 12, such as a mixture of water and thallium formate having
        a density of, for example, 2.65, in which the powdered materials
        selectively settle. Particles of higher gravitational mass
        comprising particles of the normal composition and high density
        impurities, represented by the heavy dots 14, settle more
        rapidly and there is, therefore, a greater concentration thereof
        in the lower layers of the settled materials. In the upper half
        of the layer and in the material which just floats, there is a
        greater concentration of the lighter isotopes of the composition
        (represented by small dots 16) and lower density impurities
        (represented by small dots 18). The upper layer 20 is
        illustrated on a larger scale in <a href="#0fig2">Figure 2</a>.
        Of course, the separation between upper and lower halves of the
        layer is not sharp, each containing some entrapped material
        which belongs in the other half. </p>
      <p>In <a href="#0fig1b">Figure 1B</a> is depicted the
        centrifuging step which may proceed or follow the gravitational
        step illustrated in <a href="#0fig1a">Figure 1A</a>. As
        depicted therein, four enclosed cups 24 are secured to arms 26
        and 28 and rotated about a point 30. The material from layer 20
        (in <a href="#0fig1a">Figure 1A</a>) is inserted into cups 24
        in fluid having the same density as that employed in the step of
        <a href="#0fig1a">Figure 1</a> and rotated to further the
        separation of the different masses. </p>
      <p>The diagram of <a href="#0fig3">Figure 3</a> represents the
        relation of particles in a centrifuge cup upon completion of the
        first centrifuging step. The lower inertial mass impurities
        (represented by the small circles 18 and lower inertial mass
        isotopes represented by dots 16) are more concentrated in the
        upper layer. The bottom layer comprises the higher inertial mass
        materials including the relatively small amount of
        gravitationally lighter isotopes (represented by the small dots
        16). The bottom layer may be subjected to a sequence of
        alternate sedimentation and centrifuging steps. </p>
      <p>To obtain lighter gravitational isotopes, as shown in <a
          href="#0fig4">Figure 4</a>, each subsequent sedimentation step
        is carried out in fluids of progressively lower specific
        gravity, while each subsequent centrifuging step is carried out
        in fluids of progressively higher specific gravity. Conversely,
        as shown in <a href="#0fig5">Figure 5</a>, to obtain
        progressively higher gravitational isotopes, each subsequent
        sedimentation step is carried out in fluids of progressively
        higher specific gravity, while each subsequent centrifuging step
        is carried out in fluids of progressively lower specific
        gravity. This process is continued to as many stages as may be
        necessary to secure the desired amounts of the various
        gravitational isotopes. </p>
      <p>In some instances, the so-called discarded fractions obtained
        in the settling steps may be recycled to obtain a higher
        recovery. Recycled materials ordinarily will require a larger
        number of settling and centrifuging steps than the original
        material to obtain a desired isotope concentration, because of
        the initial lower concentration of isotopes in the recycled
        material. </p>
      <p>It should be understood that commercial settling and
        centrifuging apparatus may be employed to obtain continuous
        instead of batch beneficiation. </p>
      <p>As stated above, in the case where the desired isotopes are
        gravitationally lighter than the normal material, the lighter
        fraction in the settling step and the more massive fraction in
        the centrifuging step is retained. In the case where the desired
        isotopes are gravitationally heavier than the normal material,
        the heavier fraction in the settling step and the less massive
        fraction in the centrifuging step is retained. Gravitational
        isotopes appear to be characterized by continuous emission or
        absorption of heat and a temperature higher or lower than the
        surrounding materials. </p>
      <p>Concentrated gravitational isotopes lighter than the normal
        material, such as those derived from Sandusky or other clays,
        other complex silicates, cobalt-nickel silicates, etc., have two
        useful properties: (1) spontaneous generation of heat, and (2)
        lower gravitational mass (or weight) than normal material. </p>
      <p>In <a href="#0fig6">Figure 6</a>, an inertially balanced
        system is represented by two identical inertial masses W1 and W2
        rigidly connected by connector 40 and balanced about a pivotal
        point 41 (to which the connector 40 is pivoted) and about which
        the system is adapted to rotate. The two inertial masses being
        equal, such a system is insensitive to inertial forces
        generally. However, weight W1 has less gravitational mass than
        W2 ad, therefore, the system responds to the earth's
        gravitational field and assumes an orientation (gravitational
        vertical) with respect to the earth. The difference in weight
        (with identical inertial masses) is effected by using one (or
        more) of the aforesaid isotopes. If it be lighter in weight than
        the normal substance, it is employed for weight W1, but if it be
        an isotope heavier than the normal substance, it is employed for
        the weight W2; or both light and heavy isotopes may be employed
        for weights W1 and W2 respectively. In concentrated form, there
        is enough difference in weight between identical inertial masses
        W1 and W2 to provide a moment (of force) sufficient to cause the
        system to respond to the earth's gravitational field and
        establish a stable vertical which remains stable despite
        inertial forces. </p>
      <p>As illustrated in <a href="#0fig6">Figure 6</a>, the system is
        advantageously provided with a pointer 42 moving with the
        system, and a stationary scale 43 (stationary relative to the
        aircraft or missile in which the device is installed) to
        indicate inclination of the latter with respect to the stable
        vertical. A telemetric device, here shown in the form of a
        Selsyn motor 44, may be employed to give a remote indication or
        exert remote control responsive to the position of the stable
        vertical on scale 43. The position of the system is translated
        to the Selsyn motor in this case by gear 45 fixed to connector
        40 concentrically with pivot 41 and meshed with gear 46 on the
        Selsyn motor shaft. Any other suitable telemetric device may be
        employed for the foregoing purposes. </p>
      <p>In the control device sensitive to inertial forces illustrated
        in <a href="#0fig7">Figure 7</a>, a similar system employing
        opposed weights is employed. In this instance, however, the
        weights M1 and M2 must have the same gravitational mass (so as
        to be balanced as regards the force of gravity) but of different
        inertial masses so as to be unbalanced and, therefore, sensitive
        to inertial forces. Weights M1 and M2 are carried in opposite
        relation on connector 50. The latter is pivoted to and
        oscillates about pivot point 51. A spring or springs 52 bias the
        system to return to a neutral position (representing absence of
        acceleration or centrifugal force). A suitable damping device 53
        may be used to reduce or prevent hunting or "overshooting". A
        pointer 54 carried by the system indicates on the stationary
        scale 55 the degree of deflection of the system in either
        direction (in response to inertial forces) from the zero or
        neutral position on the scale. If there be no acceleration or
        centrifugal force acting on the system, the spring 52 returns it
        to neutral or zero position. </p>
      <p>The weights M1 and M2 are given different inertial masses,
        though having identical gravitational masses by constituting one
        (or both) of the weights with gravitational isotopes. Equal
        weights of the normal substance and its gravitational isotopes
        or equal weights of light and heavy isotopes will have different
        inertial masses. It is immaterial whether the greater mass be M1
        or M2. In either case, the system will be unbalanced as regards
        the forces of inertia, but balanced as regards the forces of the
        earth's gravitational field. Under acceleration, deceleration or
        centrifugal force, the greater mass will control and overbalance
        the lesser mass against the restraining force of spring 52 and
        deflect the system in accordance with the degree of
        acceleration, deceleration or centrifugal force. </p>
      <p>A Selsyn motor 56 or other telemetric device may be coupled
        with the system by gears 57 and 58 as in the device of <a
          href="#0fig6">Figure 6</a> to give remote indication of the
        deflection of the device and/or to actuate remotely located
        instrumentalities controlled thereby. </p>
      <p>Referring now to <a href="#0fig8">Figure 8</a>, there is
        depicted a meter of the immersion type for indicating a stable
        vertical. In this meter, an enclosed container 60 contains a
        suitable fluid. Mounted within the container is a dial 62 and a
        pointer 63 pivotally mounted on the center of the dial 62.
        Pointer 62 has a concentrated mass 64 mounted intermediate its
        length, which mass may advantageously contain material bearing
        beneficiated isotopes of the type previously described. The top
        of container 60 comprises transparent material so that the scale
        may be readily seen. The fluid bears a relationship to the mass
        64 such that the fluid and mass have the same inertial mass but
        the concentrated mass 64 has a lower gravitational mass.
        Therefore, the system is inertially symmetrical and
        gravitationally asymmetrical. The pointer 63 will, therefore,
        respond preferably to a gravitational field, always aligning
        itself in the zenith-nadir direction. </p>
      <p>In <a href="#0fig9">Figure 9</a>, there is illustrated another
        embodiment of this invention for indicating the acceleration of
        gravity. As herein depicted a container 70 having a transparent
        wall has a suitable fluid contained therein. A scale 72
        calibrated in acceleration is secured to container 70 and
        indicating arm 74 is pivotally mounted in the container and its
        position is biased by means of spring 76 connected between the
        scale 72 and the indicating arm 74. Mounted on arm 74 is mass
        76. Advantageously, the mass 76 is inertially symmetrical with
        respect to the fluid surrounding the meter and filling the
        container 70. The mass 76 is gravitationally asymmetrical with
        respect to the fluid. Thus, the gravity meter will be
        insensitive to inertia, but will indicate the force of gravity
        even though the container 70 may be moving under an accelerating
        force. </p>
      <p>Referring now to <a href="#0fig10">Figure 10</a>, there is
        depicted an accelerometer in accordance with this invention. In
        this device a container 80, having one transparent wall,
        contains suitable fluid, an indicating scale 82, an indicator
        84, and a pair of springs 85 and 86 supporting the indicator 84
        at the mid-point of the scale 82. Indicator 84 has mounted
        thereon a mass 86. Mass 86 bears a relationship to the fluid
        such that they are gravitationally symmetrical while being
        inertially asymmetrical. By biasing the indicator 84 at the
        midpoint of the scale 82, the indicator 84 will indicate
        acceleration in either direction transversely of the meter, as
        shown in Figure 10. This meter will be insensitive to gravity
        since the mass 86 is gravitationally symmetrical with respect to
        the fluid. It is, of course, understood that this accelerometer
        may be operated in any position without showing a static effect.
      </p>
      <p>It is to be understood that the devices in Figures 8, 9, and 10
        exhibit one definite additional advantage in that they are all
        highly damped by the fluid in the containers. </p>
      <p>It is also to be understood that in the discussion of Figures
        8, 9, and 10 the isotopes are contained in the concentrated
        masses 64, 76 and 86. It is entirely possible, however, to
        achieve the same inertial and gravitational relationships by
        suspending, mixing or compounding the isotopes in the fluid
        rather than employing them as concentrated masses. If isotopes
        are added to the fluid then the concentrated masses will not
        contain gravitational isotopes or may contain isotopes of the
        opposite sense, i.e., lighter or heavier. </p>
      <p>Telemetric systems such as are commonly used in aircraft or
        missile guidance, similar to those shown in Figures 6 and 7, may
        be employed with any of the above total immersion devices for
        transmission of data. </p>
      <p>While I have shown and described various embodiments of my
        invention, it is understood that the principles thereof may be
        extended to many and varied types of machines and apparatus. The
        invention therefore is not to be limited to the details
        illustrated and described herein. </p>
      <p>The embodiments of the invention in which an exclusive property

        isotopes is obtained, each subsequent settling step being
        conducted in a fluid of progressively different specific
        gravity, each subsequent centrifuging step being conducted in a

        <p><a name="disclosure"></a><b><font size="+1">Method for
              Producing Gravitationally-Anomalous Materials</font></b> </p>
        <p>(April 1, 1973) </p>
        <p><b>Thomas Townsend Brown</b></p>
      </center>
      <p><br>
      </p>
      <p>The method relates to the process by which certain materials
        are made to lose weight and become anomalously light. Certain
        susceptible material, including complex silicates, aluminates
        and clays, and certain rare-earth (and other) elements, when
        processed, actually decrease in weight. The result is not only a
        real loss of weight; such materials suffer a retardation in
        gravitational acceleration (value of g) to an appreciable
        extent. This abnormal lightness, in many instances, is not
        permanent but tends, in time, to disappear, so that eventually
        the weight returns to normal. </p>
      <p>While being processed, as described herein, materials lose
        weight, rapidly at the start and then more slowly as processing
        continues, reaching a minimum (asymptotically) depending upon
        the energy available in processing. </p>
      <p>When this point is reached and processing is discontinued, the
        weight of the processed materials beings immediately to regain
        weight, rapidly at first and then more and more slowly as time
        goes on, again reaching normal weight asymptotically. </p>
      <p>Heat is given off spontaneously as this recovery takes place,
        the temperature differential (with the ambient) being greatest
        at the start of the recovery and then diminishes to zero as the
        weight of the material approaches normal. </p>
      <p>The present commercial use of materials having anomalous weight
        or lightness would appear to be, in the main, as materials of
        construction for spacecraft or the like. A further use,
        resulting from the lowered gravitational acceleration (<i>g</i>)
        is anticipated in astro-navigational instruments, as gravitic
        dipoles, in gravity vector sensors and inertial guidance systems
        for spacecraft. </p>
      <p>The exothermal characteristics make the processed materials (as
        described herein) useful in several additional practical
        applications and this will be the subject of a further patent
        application. </p>
      <p>The scientific reasons for the loss of weight are not clearly
        understood at the present time. The phenomenon appears to reside
        in the outer electronic shells of the excited atoms, not the
        nuclei. Hence, the inertial mass probably is not affected. If
        abnormal lightness is the result of an excited state, meaning
        the addition of energy, then the inertial mass will certainly be
        increased, but almost infinitesimally. Indeed, this would seem
        to be anticipated by the equation E = mc<sup>2</sup>, where E
        represents the total contained energy and m represents the
        inertial mass of the material. </p>
      <p>In any event, the long-accepted "postulate of equivalence"
        (inertial mass being equal to gravitational mass) must be
        abandoned in attempting to explain the phenomenon described
        here. Apparently this surprising action is a new form of atomic
        excitation, undiscovered and not even theoretically predicted.
        The situation is so baffling that no further discussion of
        theory can be attempted at the present time. </p>
      <p>The method of excitation specifically set forth in this
        disclosure utilizes mechanical friction only. It is termed
        "tribo-excitation". Other methods of gravitic excitation appear
        to be possible and, as they are developed, will be the subjects
        of additional patent applications. </p>
      <p>Tribo-excitation for the production of
        gravitationally-anomalous materials can be accomplished in
        several different but related ways, such as: </p>
      <p>(1) Vigorous shaking of granular materials -- inter-particle
        (Coulomb) friction. </p>
      <p>(2) Grinding or pulverizing -- cleavage and intra-particle
        friction. </p>
      <p>(3) Sand blasting -- scouring, abraiding, spalling or ablating.
      </p>
      <p>(4) Physical deformation -- compressing, tensing, bending --
        inter-molecular friction. </p>
      <p>All of the above methods are essentially frictional. The mere
        "rubbing together" off pieces of susceptible materials, either
        alike or different, causes "tribo-excitation". Materials which
        are energetically excited in this way become gravitationally
        lighter. As stated earlier, this excitation and its resultant
        lightness is not permanent but eventually disappears. As the
        excitation decays, the weight increases, returning to normal
        eventually. During this return, the material is warmer than its
        environment and the energy of excitation escapes as heat. </p>
      <p>Referring to the accompanying drawings, the apparatus to
        accomplish this frictional method of excitation may takes, but
        is not necessarily limited to, the following forms: </p>

      <p>Referring to these drawings in detail: </p>
      <p><a href="#00fig1">Figure 1</a> shows the simplest form of
        shaker. It may be a paint-shaker such as that used in a paint
        store. Container 1 preferably is made of glass or porcelain (for
        technical reasons not disclosed). The contents 2 may be aluminum
        silicate (clays), barium aluminate, ytterbium or other rare
        earth powders, tantalum powder, loess, monazite sand, bauxite or
        other ores. </p>
      <p>In prototype tests, container 1 is filled with material 2 to be
        excited. It is hermetically sealed to prevent leakage and is
        carefully weighed. It is then vibrated 30 to 50 minutes, removed
        from the shaker and weighed again, container and contents
        together. </p>
      <p><a href="#00fig2">Figure 2</a> illustrates a type of
        electromagnetic vibrator to accomplish the same result as in <a
          href="#00fig1">Figure 1</a>. </p>
      <p><a href="#00fig3">Figure 3</a> illustrates a vibrator powered
        by magnetostrictive or electrostrictive ultrasonic transducers.
        The high frequency of vibration, over and beyond that possible
        in the apparatus of Figures 1 and 2, provides greater energy of
        excitation, and thus causes a further loss of weight than that
        possible with the apparatus having lower frequency of vibration.
      </p>
      <p><a href="#00fig4">Figure 4</a> shows a slightly different form
        of excitation apparatus: a grinder. The grinder shown is a ball
        mill. The balls 4 may be steel, porcelain, or tantalum,
        depending upon the degree of excitation required. Jar 5 should
        preferably be made of porcelain. The mill is rotated by motor 6.
      </p>
      <p><a href="#00fig5">Figure 5</a> shows a still different form of
        apparatus: a sanding machine. The method here is to grind or
        abraid the surface of a susceptible solid 7, such as granite,
        sandstone, porcelain or the like so as to cause it to become
        excited. </p>
      <p>In <a href="#00fig6">Figure 6</a> the same idea is set forth
        as in <a href="#00fig5">Figure 5</a>, except that grinding or
        abrasion is accomplished by sand blasting. Sand is blown by
        compressed air at high velocity against target (susceptible)
        material 8, causing the material to become gravitically excited.
      </p>
      <p>In both Figures 5 and 6, the ablation fragments and impact
        ejecta may be gravitically excited after impact, and this
        material may also be collected&nbsp; and utilized. </p>
      <p>While in the foregoing, inter-particle friction has usually
        resulted in loss of weight, it is conceivable that in certain
        distances, depending upon the materials used (especially light
        components) a gain in weight may sometimes be observed and
        possibly utilized. Hence, in the appended claims, any alteration
        of weight lies within the intended scope of the invention. </p>
