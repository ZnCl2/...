      Young plants of giant wild lettuce are a good ingredient for
      heroic salads. This is the most cold hardy of all lettuces,
      germinates in the fall and grows very nicely through the winter in
      a zone 7, producing very reasonable salads midwinter, which is
      before the plant goes tough and bitter. Lactuca virosa is a
      preferred wild species from Europe–nutrient dense, good winter
      salad, bright purple-black seeds, much less spiny than the new
      world weedy types. Mature plants contain high concentrations of
      bitter, rubbery sap, which when milked from the plant and dried is
      known as lactucarium. So concentrated, the sap is mildly sedative,
      antitussive, and analgesic. Origination: Native to Central and
      Southern Europe. Recommended Uses: Mature plants contain high
      concentrations of bitter, rubbery sap, which when milked from the
      plant and dried is known as lactucarium. So concentrated, the sap
      is mildly sedative, antitussive, and analgesic. Height: Up to 6
      feet tall Flower Color: Green Uses: Salads Organically Grown
      Sowing Instructions Surface sow seeds into flats of moist soil,
      pressing lightly and keeping moist for germination in 7-14 days
      keeping seeds at 70 degrees Fahrenheit. Keep in partial sun until

      Lettuce opium is the holy grail of wild lettuce products! The
      medicinal name for lettuce opium is lactucarium, we're just
      calling it sticky extract for the time being. It came into pretty
      big production in the 19th century in Aubière, France. The method
      developed by the pharmacist H. Aubergier involved employing the
      women of the village to cut the plants and harvest the sap by
      hand. These days it's done by a tailored extraction using water
      and alcohol in a modern laboratory. THIS IS GENUINE LACTUCA VIROSA
      EXTRACT, NOT CHEAP AND FAKE CHINESE EXTRACT<br>

      Wild lettuce is a small, biennial herbaceous plant in the
      Asteraceae family found throughout Europe, Southeast England, the
      Punjab region of Pakistan, Australia, and the Southeastern United
      States along roadsides and in open fields. It has a central erect
      hollow stem that is a typically smooth and pale green, sometimes
      spotted with purple, from which a rosette of broad spiny leaves
      grow. The plant starts as a low-lying rosette, but in the summer
      when it goes to flower and seed bolts into a spindly upright
      plant. There are a few prickles on the lower parts of the plant
      and on the short horizontal branches above. The numerous, large,
      radical leaves are from 6 to 18 inches long, entire, and
      obovate-oblong. The rough, black fruit is oval, with a broad wing
      along the edge, and prolonged above into a long, white beak
      carrying silvery tufts of hair. The plant has a brown tap-root and
      summer blooming clusters of pale yellow composite flowers. Its
      harvested when in full bloom in the late summer and stored best
      juiced, dried, or prepared in a tincture. It’s easily cultivated
      in the garden in well drained, moist soils in full sun. The whole
      plant is rich in a bitter, milky juice that flows freely from any
      wound. When dry, it hardens, turns brown, and is known as
      lactucarium.<br>

      <b>Parts Used</b><br>
      <br>
      Fresh leaves, Latex sap<br>
      <br>
      <b>Medicinal Uses</b><br>
      <br>
      Wild Lettuce is a non-addictive sedative, antitussive, anodyne,
      mild psychotropic, and hypnotic herb, most commonly used to treat
      insomnia, restlessness, anxiety, over-active nervous systems, and
      excitable children. It’s anti-spasmodic properties can be useful
      in treating whooping cough as well as soothing other coughs. It
      also relieves muscular pains associated with rheumatic arthritis,
      as well as colic pain in the guts and uterus, making it a good
      choice when treating menstrual cramps. The plant is best used
      fresh, preferably juiced, which can be either taken immediately or
      dehydrated for storage. The dried leaf has value, but it loses
      most of its pain relieving qualities when dried. However, dried,
      it still acts as a mild sedative that can help with pain and
      sleep, especially when combined with other herbs.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Folk Uses</b><br>
      <br>
      Once commonly known as “Lettuce Opium”, Wild Lettuce was a common
      sedative. It was smoked to induce a dreamy, hypnotic state that
      was milder and less addictive than opium. Dioscorides, an 1st
      century physician, noted Wild Lettuce had similar effects to that
      of the opium poppy, and in a concentrated state, was a strong
      hallucinogen. It was mixed with mother’s milk to soothe burns, and
      cooked in any type of milk as a home remedy for arthritis. Boiled
      with rose, it made a useful compress for easing headaches. It was
      also considered an anaphrodesiac, commonly applied as a compress
      with camphor to the testicles to repress sexy dreams. A decoction
      of the leaves was also used as a face wash. In Assyrian herbal
      medicine, wild lettuce seeds were used with cumin as a poultice
      for soothing the eyes. It was brought to the United States from
      Europe supposedly as an adulterant for opium.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Flavor Profile and Energetics</b><br>
      <br>
      Bitter, cooling<br>
      <br>
      <b>Dosage</b><br>
      <br>
      As an infusion, 1-2 teaspoons of the dried leaves per cup of
      boiling water, steeped for 10-15 minutes. As a tincture, 2-4ml
      three times a day.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Combinations</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      For irritable coughs, combine with wild cherry bark or licorice.
      For insomnia and restlessness, combine with valerian and pasque
      flower, or other pleasant tasting nerviness such as chamomile,
      lavender, and mint.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Contraindications</b><br>
      <br>
      Pregnant women and individuals with glaucoma and prostate
      enlargement should avoid this herb. Ingesting very large
      quantities can result in stupor, difficulty breathing, coma, and
      in extreme cases, death. This herb should be avoided two weeks
      before undergoing any surgery due to possible complications with
      anesthesia. Allergic reactions in individuals that are sensitive
      to ragweed are possible.<br>

      addition of reducing agents or acids, e.g sulphurous acid, sodium

      destroying the oxydases by heating to 80 DEG C. Preservatives may
      be added for preventing the formation of mould. The liquid product
      may be evaporated to dryness.<br>
      <br>
      The desiccated latex of Lactuca virosa, known as Lactucarium, is
      an old popular remedy, which was formerly employed, on account of
      its mild narcotic action, for subduing coughs, spasmodic coughs,
      insomnia and asthma.<br>
      <br>
      Commercial lactucarium can be obtained by collecting, in a basin,
      the latex issuing after a cross cut has been made through a shoot
      After standing for about a day, the coagulated sap is removed from
      the basin and slowly dried in the air or by slightly warming The
      lactucarium is then obtained as a viscid mass, in the form of
      spherical segments, dark brown on the outside and grey to
      yellowish-white inside.<br>
      <br>
      The fresh, fluid latex has the following approximate composition:<br>
      <br>
      by weight Water 78 % Constituents soluble in water 10 % Do
      insoluble do 12 % In Pharmacy, lactucarium was usually employed by
      being triturated and brought into the condition of an emulsion
      This lactucarium and its preparations were recommended in numerous
      medical publications, so that, formerly, it was widely used On the
      other hand, the entire inefficacy of the product was set forth in
      other publications This uncertainty of action led to lactucarium
      being displaced progressively by the more reliable opium and its
      preparations; and it has now practically disappeared from the
      pharmacopeia.<br>
      <br>
      Exhaustive experiments have now shewn that the decline and
      irregularity in the action of lactucarium is due to the following
      causes:<br>
      <br>
      ( 1) The active substancees are destroyed by oxidation in the air.<br>
      <br>
      ( 2) The destruction is accelerated by oxydases which are present,
      in a high state of concentration, in the latex.<br>
      <br>
      ( 3) The destruction is also accelerated 55 by the existing method
      of preparation, the removal of the water being effected in the
      presence of the substances which are insoluble in water, whilst,
      at the same time, the water-soluble, but active 60 substances are
      carried towards the outside, by the water migrating to the surface
      In this manner, the concentration of active substances in the
      lactucarium diminishes from the interior 65 outwards, the
      composition, therefore, becoming irregular; and, moreover, the
      active substances, susceptible to oxidation, accumulate at the
      surface and are, therefore, particularly exposed to rapid 70
      destruction The destruction is further accelerated because, by
      reason of its high sugar content ( 4 %), tile lactucarium forms a
      good nutrient subtratum for mould fungi, and falls a prey to mould
      75 and rot These perceptions have led to the new process forming
      the subject of the present Application.<br>
      <br>
      It has been proposed to treat the expressed juice of lactuca
      virosa by heat 80 ing it to 95 ' so as to remove solid albuminous
      material and to evaporate the water soluble portion to obtain a
      soft extract.<br>
      <br>
      It has been ascertained, however, that 85 all the active
      constituents of the latex of lactlca virosa can be recovered, with
      certainty, in a stable, unitform and watersoluble state by
      separating tile freshly coagulated (or only a few days old) latex
      90 into a solution containing all the active substances, and a
      solid, inactive portion, followed by preventing the destruction of
      the active substances by an addition of reducing agents 95 For
      this purpose, and in accordance with the present invention, the
      fresh latex is preferably mixed with water and then separated, by
      filtration, centrifuging or the like, into an active solution and
      a 100 solid, inactive portion.<br>
      <br>
      If, instead of being immediately dried, as in the old method of
      preparation, the fresh latex be protected against loss of water
      through evaporation, by closing 105 the collecting vessel, a
      spontaneous 483,789 separation into an aqueous solution and a
      solid component occurs after coagulation In such event, the
      aqueous solution containing all the active substances can -5 be
      separated from the solid, inactive substances by aspiration,
      centrifuging, pressing and washing.<br>
      <br>
      The resulting product can be rendered permanently stable by an
      addition of reducing agents, or acids, such as sulphurous acid,
      sodium bisulphite, formaldehyde, tartaric acid, citric acid and
      the like.<br>
      <br>
      The product may also be stabilised by destroying the contained
      oxydases by warming the solution to 800 C, the time required
      varying in accordance with the oxydase content.<br>
      <br>
      For subduing mould fungi, a preservative, su ch as aminobenzaic
      acid, salicylic acid, and the like, may be added to the solutions.<br>
      <br>
      By the new process, the whole of the active constituents of the
      latex of Lactuca virosa are obtained in the form of a perfectly
      homogeneous stable, dry and water-soluble powder, which is free
      from all ballast substances retarding resorption The amount of the
      eliminated inactive substances is more than half the dry weight.<br>
      <br>
      This product also represents a great improvement for the
      pharmaceutical technique of the further working up into
      therapeutic preparations, because:<br>
      <br>
      ( 1) The active substances are present in water-soluble form, ( 2)
      The removal of the inactive substances could enable the
      therapeutic doses to be reduced by more than one half, a point of
      considerable importance in the manufacture of tablets.<br>
      <br>
      ( 3) Uniform dosing can be attained reliably; ( 4) The active
      substances are perfectly stable in storage.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 1.</b><br>
      <br>
      The latex, issuing after incising the plants, is stripped off into
      a vessel containing water, sulphbrous acid or a solution of sodium
      bisulphite, tartaric acid or citric acid The latex coagulates and
      is separated, by filtration, aspiration or pressing, into a
      solution containing all the active substances, and a solid,
      inactive portion The residual portions of solution contained in
      the solid portion are extracted by washing.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 2.</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The latex, issuing, after incising the 60 plants, is collected in
      a vessel adapted to be closed, such as a bottle or jar with a
      capacity of about 100-200 cc When full, the vessel is closed,
      thereby preventing evaporation of the water After 65 standing for
      about a day, spontaneous separation into a solid and a liquid
      portion occurs The spontaneously separated solution, which
      contains the active substances, is separated from the solid, 70
      inactive constituents by aspiration, pressing, filtration and
      washing.<br>
      <br>
      For the purpose of destroying the oxydases, the resulting solution
      is heated to about 80 C until no oxydases are any 75 longer
      detectable by the Whitby method (Kolloid Zeitschrift, vol 12 (
      1913), p 149), after which it is evaporated to dryness.<br>
