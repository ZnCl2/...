        </big></div>
      <br>
      Serious problems of irrigation and rural water supply may shortly
      be solved by an extraordinary apparatus recently perfected in
      England, which automatically raises 14 gallons of water from a
      stream to a height of 20 feet in a little less than 3 minutes,
      without the use of pumps or any source of power other than what
      nature furnishes. This device, seems at first glance something
      like perpetual motion applied to water, and called by its
      inventor, T.G. Allen, a "hydrautomat", or "water staircase", is
      hailed by engineers as marvelously ingenious. It is an
      extraordinary improvement on the hydraulic ram commonly used.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Two Energy Sources Used</b><br>
      <br>
      In all the centuries in which men have attempted to make nature
      serve them through two sources of energy -- the weight of water
      and atmospheric pressure -- no such radical invention has been
      recorded.<br>
      <br>
      Using these two forces, the experimental "water staircase" --
      erected near London -- is said to operate with extraordinary
      efficiency. It consists of an alternating series of open and
      closed tanks, one above the other, the action of which is to use
      the energy of a quantity of water at a given level to raise a
      smaller quantity of water to a higher level.<br>
      <br>
      The stream from which the power is derived, empties into an open
      intake tank located 7-1/2 feet above the lowest level of the
      device. Thus there is an available fall of 7-1/2 feet from the
      upper level of the stream, which may be termed the head race, to
      the lower level, or tail race. Half way between the upper and
      lower levels is an airtight operating chamber, supplied with an
      intake pipe from the head race, and a discharge pipe to the tail
      race. Above the upper water level is the alternating series of
      closed and open tanks. These tanks are interconnected by pipes. In
      addition, the closed tanks are coupled to the operating chamber by
      an air pipe.<br>
      <br>
      Operation of the "water stairway" is confined to two strokes -- a
      pressure stroke followed by a suction stroke. The pressure is
      created by the water column flowing from the open supply basin
      just below the surface of the head race into the airtight
      operating chamber.<br>
      <br>
      The effect of this water flow is to compress the air in the
      operating chamber and to force it upward through the air pipe into
      the two closed and water-filled tanks. Immediately the water in
      these tanks, lifted by the preceding stroke, is forced upward into
      the two open tanks above them.<br>
      <br>
      Thus at the end of the pressure stroke, the operating chamber and
      the two open tanks are full of water, while the two closed tanks
      are full of air.<br>
      <br>
      <b>How the Water "Climbs"</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Inthe suction stroke the contents of the operating chamber are
      discharged downward into the tail race, or discharge pipe, through
      a siphon, and at the same time the inlet from the head race into
      the operating chamber is automatically closed. This is
      accomplished by a valve actuated by the rush of water out of the
      discharge pipe. In the operating chamber is thus produced a vacuum
      that also extends to the two closed tanks, by virtue of the
      connecting pipe.<br>
      <br>
      the result of this vacuum is that it sucks up the water "one
      flight" from the corresponding tank below. Thus at the end of the
      suction stroke, the open tanks are empty of water and the closed
      tanks are full. The valve in the head race inlet then opens
      automatically, pressured water is admitted into the operating
      chamber, a new stroke starts, and the cycle is repeated.<br>

      <br>
      THE problem of raising a small quantity of water to a considerable
      height by utilising the energy of a larger mass of water has been
      solved in a number of ways. In the seventeenth century, the City
      of London was supplied with water pumped from the Thames by means
      of a reciprocating pump, driven by a crank which was made to
      rotate by a water-wheel turned by the flow of the river. The
      “hydraulic ram “is a device that has been successfully used, and
      recently there has been developed a device, the hydrautomat, which
      utilises the pressure of the atmosphere to lift water...<br>

      <div align="center"><b>WATER-RAISING : </b><b>THE HYDRAUTOMAT --
          AN IMPORTANT INVENTION</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      There is Installed in an office In Washington, U.S.A., a working
      model of what is described as one of the world's greatest
      engineering devices. It Is called the hydrautomat and is literally
      a water-self-worker, which makes it possible for flowing water to
      raise itself from one level to another. Many engineers assort that
      the invention "will solve the great problems of providing a
      continuous water supply for arid areas, and Sir Oliver Lodge says
      of the hydrautomat: "I can only express my admiration of the
      simplicity and beauty of the invention, and my wonder that
      humanity has had to wait so long for the construction of an
      arrangement which must prove of the greatest service."<br>
      <br>
      The inventor is Mr. Thomas Gaskell Allen, a well-known London
      hydraulic engineer. The invention attracted tho attention of the
      United States Government Department of Weights and Measures, and
      it was at the request of that department that Mr. Allon set up the
      working model in Washington. The model is only three feet in
      diameter and eight feet in height, but it is capable, on actual
      working experiment, of raising more than 70,000 gallons of water
      daily. Mr. Francis Arnold Collins describes the working of the
      model in the "St. Nicholas" magazine (an American publication) for
      June. He states that by means of the hydrautomat water is raised
      automatically to any desired level, silently and efficiently. A
      stream whose head or flow is so sluggish that it cannot be used in
      any other way can thus be utilised. The contrivance is
      self-contained, and, once set up beside a stream or within reach
      of running water, will operate without attention. It is really an
      engine in which the force of the running water and the pressure of
      the air work alternately to develop power without the assistance
      of human hands.<br>
      <br>
      The stream from which the power is derived empties into an open
      intake tank located 7.5 feet above the lowest level of the device.
      Thus there is an available fall of 7.5 feet from the upper level
      of the stream, which may be termed the head race, to the lower
      level, or tail race. Half-way between the upper and lower levels
      is an air-tight operating chamber, supplied with an intake pipe
      from the head race, and a discharge pipe to the tail race. Above
      the upper water level is the alternating series of closed and open
      tanks. These tanks are interconnected by pipes. In addition, the
      closed tanks are coupled to the operating chamber by an air pipe.<br>
      <br>
      Operation of the "water stairway" is confined to two strokes -- a
      pressure stroke followed by a suction stroke. The pressure is
      created by the water column flowing from tho open supply basin
      just below the level of the head race into the air-tight operating
      chamber.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      The effect of this water flow is to compress the air in the
      operating chamber and to force it upward through the air pipe into
      the two closed and water filled tanks. Immediately the water in
      these tanks, lifted there by the preceding stroke, is forced
      upward into the two open tanks above them.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, at the end of the pressure stroke, the operating chamber and
      the two open tanks are full of water, while the two closed tanks
      are full of air. In the suction stroke the contents of the
      operating chamber, are discharged downward into the tall race, or
      discharge pipe, through a syphon, and at the same time the inlet
      from the head race into the operating chamber is automatically
      closed. This is accomplished by a valve actuated by the rush of
      water out of the discharge pipe. In the operating chamber is thus
      produced a vacuum that also extends to the two closed tanks, by
      virtue of the connecting pipe.<br>
      <br>
      The result of this vacuum is that it sucks up the water "one
      flight" from the corresponding open tank below. Thus, at the end
      of the suction stroke, the open tanks are empty of water and tho
      closed tanks are full. The valve in the head race inlet then opens
      automatically, pressure water is admitted into the operating
      chamber, a new pressure stroke starts, and the cycle is repeated.<br>
      <br>
      During his recent visit to America Mr. Allen explained to Mr.
      Collins the great service the hydrautomat promises to perform the
      world over. "The hydrautomat," he said, "simply harnesses a great
      force of nature which we have allowed in the past to go to waste.
      Men have been watching the movements of water on the earth for
      untold centuries, and accepting this great waste as a matter of
      course. The water is raised by the power of the sun and deposited
      in the form of snow or rain over the earth, and gradually flows
      back to the sea. The power which thus goes to waste is enormous.<br>
      <br>
      "The ancients studied this problem and speculated upon it a great
      deal. Archimedes hit upon a highly ingenious device for raising
      water above its own level, and his method is still employed, but
      he did not solve the problem. It is obvious, of course, that this
      enormous store of energy has lain idle all these centuries. Take a
      familiar example it is estimated that in so small a stream as the
      River Thames some 700,000 gallons of water pass a given point
      every day, even in the dry season, all going to waste. A
      series&nbsp; of hydrautomats tapping this source could pump water
      to any part of London. Every city which lies beside a flowing
      river neglects a similar opportunity.<br>
      <br>
      "Throughout the world today there are millions of acres of land
      which only need water to become highly productive. Millions of
      people could find beautiful and prosperous homes on what is now
      waste land if only the water supply can be solved. In most
      instances these arid regions, even the great deserts, could be
      transformed if water in the general vicinity could be raised only
      a few feet.<br>
      <br>
      "The hydrautomat must not be confused with the turbine. It merely
      raises water to a higher level, while the turbine catches -falling
      water, so to speak, and transforms its energy into electricity.
      The hydrautomat, however, can first raise water which, when
      released, will pass through turbines and develop power and
      electricity, which can be carried for long distances. Many
      engineers are confident that the hydrautomat can be used to
      utilise the power of the tides, thus tapping practically a
      limitless source of energy.<br>

          Hi gsmsslsb.<br>
          I am a long way from completing my study of this pump, it
          seems patience is not a possibility here on the forums, so
          here is version 1. This is without optimization or pressure
          values, to be honest it still needs to be completed as this
          will only give you a basic geometry of its operation. regards
