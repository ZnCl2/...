        <b>by <br>

          Adam Williams</b><br>
      </div>
      <b><br>
      </b>British pilot Jeremy Rowsell is set to fly solo from Sydney to
      London in a Cessna 182 aircraft powered solely by diesel derived
      from "end-of-life" plastic (ELP) waste. If all goes to plan, the
      endeavor will set a new record time for the journey in a
      single-engine piston plane, and represent a compelling argument
      for the viability of ELP as a fuel source.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      The project, dubbed "On Wings of Waste," was conceived following
      longtime pilot Rowsell's growing concern about the role that the
      aviation industry plays in harming the environment, in addition to
      the larger problem of pollution in general. To bring attention to
      the practicability of recycled plastic as a fuel source, Rowsell
      teamed up with Cynar PLC, an Irish company that converts ELP into
      synthetic diesel.<br>
      <br>
      Gizmag spoke with Cynar CEO Michael Murray via telephone, who
      explained that the company converts ELP typically destined for
      landfills into useful diesel. The conversion involves pyrolysis,
      which is the process of thermal degradation of a material in the
      absence of oxygen - so heating, but no burning, takes place.<br>
      <br>
      ELP is broken down into gases by the pyrolysis process, then put
      through a specially-designed condenser system in order to produce
      a mixture equivalent to petroleum distillates. This is then
      further treated to produce liquid fuel, while leftover gases are
      diverted back into the furnaces which heat the plastics.
      Interestingly, the diesel produced by this method is actually
      claimed more efficient and lower in sulfur than generic diesel.<br>
      <br>
      The only waste material left over from the ELP-to-diesel
      conversion process is roughly five percent char, which can also be
      put to use in the building industry for concrete and tile
      manufacturing.<br>
      <br>
      Each Cynar plant can produce up to 19,000 liters (around 5,000 US
      gallons) of fuel from 20 tons of ELP per day. For the roughly
      4,000 liters (1,000 US gallons) of fuel that Rowsell's flight will
      consume, approximately five tons of waste plastic will be
      recycled.<br>
      <br>
      Cynar's tech is being incorporated into several worldwide waste
      recycling firms, enabling such companies to convert ELP into
      diesel themselves. In addition, Cynar has penned an agreement with
      the UK's Loughborough University to in a bid to further advance
      research on the subject.<br>
      <br>
      While the diesel produced by Cynar's recycling process has been
      used many times in vehicles, Rowsell's flight will be the first
      time it has been used to power an airborne journey.<br>
      <br>
      The pilot will follow in the footsteps of aviation pioneers such
      as Charles Kingsford-Smith and Bert Hinkler. He'll be flying for
      stretches of up to 13 hours at a time, usually at around 5,000
      feet (1,500 meters), while crossing massive swathes of land and
      sea, for a total of around 12,000 nautical miles (22,000 km).<br>
      <br>
      The ambitious voyage is scheduled to take place this coming July.<br>

      ...His flight will be powered by five tons of discarded packaging
      and waste collected from rubbish dumps and – using a pioneering
      technique – melted down into 1,000 gallons of aviation-grade
      diesel.<br>
      <br>
      The 41-year-old will leave Sydney in July, flying over Asia, the
      Middle East and then Europe, and hoping to arrive in London six
      days later, after flying a single-engine Cessna 172 about 1,500
      miles a day at a speed of about 115mph.<br>
      <br>
      To do this, he will have to fly for up to 15-hour stretches to
      reach his scheduled stops on time. He will travel at an altitude
      of 5,000ft – much lower than commercial airliners, which reach up
      to 40,000ft on long-haul flights.<br>
      <br>
      The fuel will come solely from so-called “end-of-life” plastic
      that cannot be recycled and would otherwise end up as landfill,
      including household waste such as packaging and wrapping.<br>
      <br>
      The plastic will be collected from the countries in which he is
      scheduled to stop along the way and shipped to Cynar, the Dublin
      firm that will help process the waste into aviation-grade diesel.

      The system uses liquefaction, pyrolysis and distillation of
      plastics. The system can handle almost all the End of Life Plastic
      that is currently being sent to landfills. A major advantage of
      the process is its high efficiency. Each plant can produce up to
      19k litres of fuel from 20 tonnes of End of Life Plastic.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Current Situation of Recycling of Plastics</b><br>
      <br>
      Various methodologies have been tried and tested to process waste
      or end of life plastics for many years, with recycling becoming
      the most common method reflecting the needs of today. Plastics
      that cannot be processed are handled by waste management companies
      mainly through land-filling or incineration.<br>
      <br>
      The building or expanding of incinerators has become difficult due
      to opposition from governments and community groups with
      environmental concerns, most notably the levels of emissions.<br>
      <br>
      Liquefaction of plastic is a superior method of reusing this
      resource. These distillate products are excellent fuels and make
      the Cynar Technology one of the best, economically feasible and
      environmentally sensitive recycling systems in the world today.<br>
      <br>
      The synthetic fuels produced, given their low sulphur and high
      cetane qualities, will most likely be utilised by the recycling
      organisations on-site for use in the vehicle fleet as SITA plan to
      do or heavy equipment and generators.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Pyrolysis</b><br>
      <br>
      Pyrolysis is a process of thermal degradation of a material in the
      absence of oxygen. Plastic is continuously treated in a
      cylindrical chamber and the pyrolytic gases condensed in a
      specially-designed condenser system to yield a hydrocarbon
      distillate comprising straight and branched chain aliphatics,
      cyclic aliphatics and aromatic hydrocarbons. The resulting mixture
      is essentially equivalent to petroleum distillate. The plastic is
      pyrolised at 370ºC-420ºC and the pyrolysis gases are condensed and
      liquid separated using fractional distillation to produce the
      liquid fuel products.<br>
      <br>
      The essential steps in the pyrolysis of plastics involves:<br>
      <br>
      evenly heating the plastic to a narrow temperature range without
      excessive temperature variations<br>
      purging oxygen from pyrolysis chamber,<br>
      <br>
      managing the carbonaceous char by-product before it acts as a
      thermal insulator and lowers the heat transfer to the plastic<br>
      careful condensation and fractionation of the pyrolysis vapours to
      produce distillate of good quality and consistency<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>Structure of the System</b><br>
      <br>
      The system consists of stock in-feed system, pyrolysis chambers,
      contactors, distillation, oil recovery line and syn-gas..<br>
      <br>
      End of Life Plastics are loaded via a hot-melt infeed system
      directly into main pyrolysis chamber.<br>
      <br>
      Agitation commences to even the temperature and homogenise the
      feedstocks. Pyrolysis then commences and the plastic becomes a
      vapour. Non-plastic materials fall to the bottom of the chamber.<br>
      <br>
      The vapour is converted into the various fractions in the
      distillation column, the distillates then pass into the recovery
      tanks.<br>
      <br>
      The System diverts the Syn Gas through a Scrubber and then back
      into the furnaces to heat the pyrolysis chambers.<br>
      <br>
      The cleaned distillates are then pumped to the storage tanks.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Operations</b><br>
      <br>
      The heart of the pyrolysis system is the prime chamber, which
      performs the essential functions of homogenisation and controlled
      decomposition in a single process. The process requires minimal
      maintenance and produces a consistent quality distillate from End
      of Life Plastic..<br>
      <br>
      The key to an efficient pyrolysis process is to ensure the plastic
      is heated uniformly and rapidly. If temperature gradients develop
      in the molten plastic mass then different degrees of cracking will
      occur and products with a wide distribution of chain lengths will
      be formed.<br>
      <br>
      Cynar has signed an Agreement with Loughborough University in the
      UK to Partner in the further advancement/optimisation of the Cynar
      Technolgy and is also looking at converting 'other' End of Life
      Plastic feedstocks. This strategic partnership will assist in
      ensuring that the Cynar Technology will remain the world leader in
      the Pyrolysis of End of Life Plastics to Liquid Fuel.<br>

      A process is described for treating waste plasties material to
      provide at least one on-specification fuel product. Plasties
      material is melted (4) and then pyrolysed in an oxygen-free
      atmosphere to provide pyrolysis gases. The pyrolysis gases are
      brought into contact with plates (13) in a contactor vessel (7) so
      that some long chain gas components condense and return to be
      further pyrolysed to achieve thermal degradation. Short chain gas
      components exit the contactor in gaseous form; and proceed to
      distillation to provide one or more on-specification fuel
      products. There is a pipe (12) directly linking the pyrolysis
      chamber (6) to the contactor (7), suitable for conveying
      upwardly-moving pyrolysis gases and downwardly-flowing long-chain
      liquid for thermal degradation. There is a vacuum distillation
      tower (26) for further processing of liquid feeds from the first
      (atmospheric) distillation column (20). It has been found that
      having thermal degradation in the contactor and pyrolysis chamber
      and by having a second, vacuum, distillaton column helps to
      provide a particularly good quality on-specification liquid fuel.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Field of the Invention</b><b><br>

      <br>
      The invention is directed towards providing a process which more

      with an improved yield.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Summary of the Invention</b><br>
      <br>
      According to the invention, there is provided a process for
      treating waste plastics material to provide at least one fuel
      product, the process comprising the steps of:<br>
      <br>
      melting the waste plastics material,<br>
      <br>
      pyrolysing the molten material in an oxygen-free atmosphere to
      provide pyrolysis gases; bringing the pyrolysis gases into a
      contactor having a bank of condenser elements so that some long
      chain gas components condense on said elements, returning said
      condensed long-chain material to be further pyrolysed to achieve
      thermal degradation, and allowing short chain gas components to
      exit from the contactor in gaseous form; and<br>
      <br>
      distilling said pyrolysis gases from the contactor in a
      distillation column to provide one or more fuel products.<br>
      <br>
      In one embodiment, the contactor elements comprise a plurality of
      plates forming an arduous path for the pyrolysis gases in the
      contactor. Preferably, the plates are sloped downwardly for
      run-off of the condensed long-chain hydrocarbon, and include
      apertures to allow upward progression of pyrolysis gases. In one
      embodiment, the contactor elements comprise arrays of plates on
      both sides of a gas path. In one embodiment, the contactor element
      plates are of stainless steel.<br>
      <br>
      In one embodiment, the contactor is actively cooled by a cooling
      means. In one embodiment, the cooling is by a heat exchanger for
      at least one contactor element.<br>
      <br>
      In one embodiment, there is a pipe directly linking the pyrolysis
      chamber to the contactor, the pipe being arranged for conveying
      upwardly-moving pyrolysis gases and downwardly-flowing long-chain
      liquid for thermal degradation.<br>
      <br>
      In one embodiment, the cooling means comprises a contactor jacket
      and cooling fluid is directed into the jacket.<br>
      <br>
      In one embodiment, the cooling means controls a valve linking the
      jacket with a flue, opening of the valve causing cooling by
      down-draught and closing of the valve causing heating.<br>
      <br>
      In one embodiment, the valve provides access to a flue for exhaust
      gases of a combustion unit of the pyrolysis chamber. In one
      embodiment, infeed to the pyrolysis chamber is controlled
      according to monitoring of level of molten plastics in the
      chamber, as detected by a gamma radiation detector arranged to
      emit gamma radiation through the chamber and detect the radiation
      on an opposed side, intensity of received radiation indicating the
      density of contents of the chamber. In one embodiment, the
      pyrolysis chamber is agitated by rotation of at least two helical
      blades arranged to rotate close to an internal surface of the
      pyrolysis chamber. Preferably, the pyrolysis chamber is further
      agitated by a central auger. In one embodiment, the auger is
      located so that reverse operation of it causes output of char via
      a char outlet.<br>
      <br>
      In one embodiment, the temperature of pyrolysis gases at an outlet
      of the contactor is maintained in the range of 240[deg.]C to
      280[deg.]C. Preferably, the contactor outlet temperature is
      maintained by a heat exchanger at a contactor outlet. In one
      embodiment, a bottom section of the distillation column is
      maintained at a temperature in the range of 200[deg.]C to
      240[deg.]C, preferably 210[deg.]C to 230[deg.]C. Preferably, the
      top of the distillation column is maintained at a temperature in
      the range of 90[deg.]C to 110[deg.]C, preferably approximately
      100[deg.]C. In one embodiment, diesel is drawn from the
      distillation column and is further distilled to provide
      on-specification fuels.<br>
      <br>
      In one embodiment, material is drawn from the top of the
      distillation column to a knock-out pot which separates water, oil,
      and non-condensable gases, in turn feeding a gas scrubber to
      prepare synthetic gases for use in furnaces.<br>
      <br>
      In one embodiment, there is further distillation of some material
      is in a vacuum distillation column. Preferably, heavy or waxy oil
      fractions are drawn from the bottom of the vacuum distillation
      column. In one embodiment, said heavy or waxy oil is recycled back
      to the pyrolysis chamber. In one embodiment, desired grade
      on-specification diesel is drawn from a middle section of the
      vacuum distillation column. In one embodiment, light fractions are
      drawn from a top section of the vacuum distillation column and are
      condensed.<br>
      <br>
      In one embodiment, the pyrolysis chamber and the contactor are
      purged in isolation from downstream components of the system. In
      one embodiment, a purging gas such as nitrogen is pumped through
      the pyrolysis chamber and the contactor and directly from the
      contactor to a thermal oxidizer where purging gas is burned.
      Preferably, any pyrolysis gases remaining at the end of a batch
      process are delivered from the contactor and are burned off
      together with the purging gas. In one embodiment, load on a
      pyrolysis chamber agitator is monitored to provide an indication
      of when char drying is taking place. In another aspect, the
      invention provides an apparatus for treating waste plastics
      material to provide at least one fuel product, the apparatus
      comprising:<br>
      <br>
      means for melting the waste plastics material,<br>
      <br>
      a pyrolysis chamber for pyrolysing the molten material in an
      oxygen-free atmosphere to provide pyrolysis gases;<br>
      <br>
      a conduit for bringing the pyrolysis gases into a contactor having
      a bank of condenser elements so that some long chain gas
      components condense on said elements,<br>
      <br>

      <br>
      <b>Process</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Waste plastics material is processed to granular or flake form. It
      is heated in the extruder 4 and molten plastics is fed into the
      pyrolysis chambers 6. This is done while ensuring that no oxygen
      enters the system and molten plastics is maintained as close as
      possible to a pyrolysis temperature, preferably 300[deg.]C to
      320[deg.]C.<br>
      <br>
      In each pyrolysis chamber 6 the plastics material is heated to
      390[deg.]C to 410[deg.]C in a nitrogen- purged system while
      agitating. Agitation is performed by a double helical agitator
      with a central screw, and the helical blades sweep at a separation
      of about 5 mm from the chamber internal surface. This maximizes
      heat transfer at walls of the vessel 6, which is very advantageous
      due to the poor heat transfer properties of the infeed plastics
      material. Pyrolysis gases rise through the direct pipe link 12 to
      the contactor 7. In the contactor 7 there is contact between the
      vapour and the metal plates 13 in a staggered baffle-like
      arrangement. This causes some condensation of the vapour long C
      chains. The proportion of gases which are condensed in this manner
      is approximately 15% to 20%. The level of condensation can be
      controlled by control of the temperature of the jacket 7(a), which
      is cooled by chilled water and also by control of flue
      down-draught.<br>
      <br>
      The condensed liquid runs back through the same pipe 12 to the
      pyrolysis chamber 10 to be thermally degraded. The bottom of the
      contactor 6, as shown in the expanded view of Fig. 1 , is
      funnel-shaped to accommodate this flow. This process is referred
      to in this specification as thermal degradation. It avoids need
      for catalytic cracking as is performed in the prior art. The
      thermal degradation of the invention is achieved in a very simple
      manner, by simply allowing the pyrolysis gases to rise through the
      pipe 12 into the contactor 7 and for the longer/heavier chains to
      condense on the baffle plates 13 and from there to run back for
      further pyrolysis. It is our understanding that this mechanism
      avoids need for catalytic cracking because the contactors 7 ensure
      that the heavy/long carbon chains do not pass through the system
      but are broken down further in the contactors or fall back into
      the pyrolysis vessel for further degradation. Without them, very
      heavy material (half way between plastic and liquid fuel) will
      pass through the system, giving a large proportion of syngas. The
      baffle plates 13 provide an arduous path with a long residence
      time, and their apertures allow passage of the upwardly-flowing
      pyrolysis gases.<br>
      <br>
      It is envisaged that the plates may incorporate active cooling by
      being part of a heat exchanger. Such cooling could be controlled
      to fine- tune the grade of end-product diesel obtained.
      Importantly, the thermal degradation avoids need for catalysts,
      which would be expensive, require replacement, and may be consumed
      in the process. The prior art catalyst waste material is often
      hazardous, resulting in expensive disposal Also, the prior
      processes involving catalysts are much more complicated and have
      tighter operating conditions.<br>
      <br>
      An advantageous aspect of the contactor operation is that the
      valves 1 1 are used to cool down the contactors by allowing
      down-draught from the flue into the surrounding jacket. This is in
      contrast to the prior catalytic cracking approach, in which
      efforts are made to heat the catalysts as much as possible. We
      have found that by providing the valves 1 1 with access to the
      flue we have a very simple and effective mechanism for cooling the
      contactor. The temperature control of the contactors 7 is achieved
      by opening and closing the flue valves 1 1 , opening a contactor
      tower flue valve 1 1 cools the contactor due to the chimney
      down-draught effect. Also, cooling of the contactors takes place
      by controlling water flow through water pipes running through the
      contactor jackets 7(a)..<br>
      <br>
      The vapour at 250[deg.]C to 300[deg.]C and most preferably at
      260[deg.]C to 280[deg.]C is fed into the first distillation column
      20. The sump at the bottom of the column 20 has re-circulation
      through the pump 21 and the cooler 22 and the temperature is
      maintained as close as possible to 220[deg.]C in this part of the
      column 20.<br>
      <br>
      By appropriate operation of valves, diesel is drawn from the sump
      of the column 20 into the tank 23 and from there to the vacuum
      distillation column 26. On-spec diesel is provided from the vacuum
      distillation column 26 to the product tank 37. The vacuum
      distillation column 26 allows operation at much lower temperatures
      and is smaller, while achieving equivalent results to an
      atmospheric distillation column.<br>
      <br>
      The top part of the first distillation column 20 is maintained as
      close as possible to 100[deg.]C. Light oil is drawn directly to
      the tank 41. This is a by-product, but may be used to power a low-
      compression engine to power the plant or to generate electrical
      power for the grid.<br>
      <br>
      There is also a feed of light oil to the tank 41 from the top of
      the vacuum distillation column 26 via the tank 45 and the pump 46.
      It has been found that the first distillation column 20 has about
      20% light oil output and the vacuum column 26 has about 10% light
      oil output. The gas scrubber 72 washes and prepares the synthetic
      gases for use in the furnaces for the pyrolysis chamber (process
      is parasitic), and waste water is delivered for treatment. Diesel
      is drawn from the bottom section of the first distillation column
      20 to the holding tank 23 from which it is fed via the heater 25
      to the vacuum tower 26. Heavy oil is drawn from the bottom section
      of the vacuum tower 26 and is used as a supply for the pyrolysis
      chambers, suitably heated by the wax heater 28. The main product,
      diesel, is drawn from the middle section of the vacuum column 26
      via the cooler 36 to the product tank 37.<br>
      <br>
      Regarding the components 70, 71 , and 72 linked with the top of
      the first distillation column 20, synthetic gases are taken off
      the top of the column 20. The cooler 70 draws from the top of the
      column 20 to the knock-out pot 71 , which separates water, oil,
      and non-condensable gases, in turn feeding a gas scrubber 72 to
      prepare synthetic gases for use in furnaces. There is feedback
      from the knock-out pot 71 to the top of the column 20. Levels are
      automatically controlled.<br>
      <br>
      As a batch ends, increased load on the pyrolysis chamber agitator
      indicates that char drying is taking place, and that the process
      is ending. Rather than purge the full system with N2, risking the
      N2 carrying char through the full system, N2 is purged via the
      conduits 10 through the contactors 7 and the pyrolysis chambers 6
      only. Resulting vapour is drawn off from above the contactors 7
      and is burned off in a thermal oxidizer. This allows the system to
      continue without being distorted and isolates mechanical removal
      of the char. The pyrolysis chambers 6 are purged with nitrogen
      which passes up through the contactor 6 and out the top directly
      to thermal oxidisers to flush any remaining hydrocarbons. This
      ensures a safe char removal sequence. During this phase the
      pyrolysis vessel 6 and contactor 7 have been isolated from the
      rest of the system. This reduces process time and prevents char
      from being carried through the system and fouling components such
      as the fuel lines and pumps. It has been found that this provides
      improved stability in the process by avoiding risk of
      contamination of downstream components with char particles. It
      also reduces the purging time.<br>
      <br>
      The double helical agitator blades are operated in reverse to
      remove char during purging. This char removal process can be
      performed continuously, if desired. The char leaves the pot by
      opening a large valve at the base of the pyrolysis vessel 6. Under
      the pyrolysis vessel is a negatively charged pot which initially
      draws the char into it. The agitator is designed at the base such
      that when it operates in the reverse direction to that during
      processing it sweeps the char into the centre of the vessel and
      the agitator screw pushes the char down into a char pot. Once
      cooled, the char is vacuumed into a char vessel for removal from
      site.<br>
      <br>
      The pyrolysis chamber jacket is heated to c. 590[deg.]C so that
      there is further drying of the char for about 4 hours.<br>
      <br>
      Although not illustrated, each pyrolysis chamber 6 has a detector
      for determining content of the chamber for control purposes. The
      detector comprises a gamma radiation source on one side and a
      receiver along the opposed side. The intensity of radiation
      detection on the receiving side provides an indication of level in
      the chamber 6. A major advantage is that the emitter and the
      receiver are mounted on the outside of the chamber 6, and so are
      totally non-invasive. The emitted gamma radiation is attenuated as
      it passes through the chamber 6, the intensity detected at the
      receiver being an indication of the density of contents of the
      chamber 6.<br>
      <br>
      Referring to Fig. 2 various parameters for the system are
      monitored for effective system control. It shows that as the
      agitator load increases (in this example at about 14.30 hours)
      when char drying is taking place. It also shows that the bottom of
      the first distillation column 20 stays approximately constant,
      even between batches, due to operation of a heater.<br>
      <br>
      It will also be appreciated that the contactor 7 outlet
      temperature can rise above optimum towards the end of the batch.<br>
      <br>
      It has been found that the process as described above provides a
      high quality diesel product in the tank 37, meeting the EN590
      European standards. The other major on-spec fuel is BS2869 for
      kerosene. The invention is not limited to the embodiments
      described but may be varied in construction and detail. For
      example, there may be a cooler at the contactor 7 outlet to
      maintain a vapour outlet temperature in the desired range. Also,
      there may be additional active cooling of the contactors 7, such
      as by chilled water circulation in a jacket around the contactor
      plates, or indeed by an arrangement in which the contactor has an
      active heat exchanger in direct contact with the pyrolysis gases.
      Such a heat exchanger may replace some or all of the baffle plates
      described above. This cooler may for example work with oil which
      is passed through the cooler at the target temperature. Chilled
      water may be used to control the oil temperature. The cooling
      system may also include a liquid knockout pot for return of
      heavier chains to the pyrolysis chambers 6 for further cracking.
      It has been found that maintenance of the vapour temperature at
      this level at the outlet of the contactor 7 is particularly
      advantageous for achieving the desired grade of fuel products.<br>
