    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Bill Bokon</span>, a master
      machinist and automotive expert, has invented a low-cost,
      lightweight, pollution-free motor that can drive cars, trucks ,
      boats and generators with amazing fuel efficiency.<br>
      <br>
      The San Bernardino CA inventor has designed, built and patented
      two "vapor-dyne" motors in the past four years, but so far the
      only thanks he's received from a nation needing new and better
      ideas is a one-way ticket to Indonesia.<br>
      <br>
      Bokon's engines are steam-powered and run beautifully on a mixture
      of alcohol and water; 70% alcohol and 30% water.<br>
      <br>
      "Laboratory tests indicate we can drive a large automobile at
      highway speeds and obtain better than 50 miles per gallon", Bokon
      said.<br>
      <br>
      Actually the inventor feels certain he can get up to 80 mpg of the
      less costly fuel, but "I'm being conservative with the estimates".<br>
      <br>
      The "vapor-dyne" consists of only 17 moving parts and a complete
      engine weighs only 45 pounds.<br>
      <br>
      "This engine will run trouble-free for better than 150,000 miles",
      Bokon stressed, "because it turns only about 750 rpm, and still
      gets the job done".<br>
      <br>
      Today's complex gasoline burners idle at about 1200 rppm and
      lubrication is a costly problem.<br>
      <br>
      "I've been around automobiles and engines all my life", Bokon
      explained, "and I know I have something valuable -- a better way
      to transport people and products".<br>
      <br>
      Bokon came up with the basic idea for his revolutionary engine
      when he was only a boy of 17 living in South Bend IN.<br>
      <br>
      "The germ of the idea popped into my head while I was busy
      overhauling a Model-T Ford for a neighbor", Bokon said.<br>
      <br>
      "A few years later, in 1946, I went to work at the Studebaker
      plant in South Bend where my older brother was the assistant chief
      engineer".<br>
      <br>
      Bokon points out that even as a youngster he wondered why
      automotive engineers insisted upon driving motors at higher and
      higher rpm to obtain more horsepower. The higher the rpm the
      harder it is on the machinery and the shorter the life of the
      motor.<br>
      <br>
      "I thought they should reduce the rpm and find another way to get
      the horsepower. They told me that if I was so damn smart, why
      don't I do it?".<br>
      <br>
      So he did!<br>
      <br>
      Slowly, over the years, Bokon worked it out. The finished product
      came in the form of his first "vapor-dyne" engine which he built
      by hand at a cost of more than $50,000 and years of time.<br>
      <br>
      "The vapor-dyne is a radial, externally powered, eight cylinder
      power plant that spins at 750 rpm", he explained.<br>
      <br>
      The major difference between Bokon's motor and other Otto-cycle
      engines is that his vapor-dyne does not have a crankshaft.<br>
      <br>
      In standard engines the crankshaft turns as the pistons are
      repelled by the gasoline exploding in the chambers, thus turning
      the up-and-down motion into circular drive. The system, though it
      is standard, is inefficient and costly.<br>
      <br>
      "Automotive engineers know that about 90% of the fuel used is
      burned to operate the machinery and less than 10% actually drives
      the car", Bokon said.<br>
      <br>
      Today's high-performance cars may get up to 17% actual drive from
      the fuel utilized.<br>
      <br>
      Instead of a crankshaft, the two vapor-dynes use a swashplate, a
      simple device that engineers have known for a long time.<br>
      <br>
      "In basic terms the swashplate is a revolving circular plate that
      is set obliquely on a shaft. It actually acts as a camshaft to
      give back and forth motion to a rod", Bokon said.<br>
      <br>
      To further illustrate this principle, Bokon recently designed a
      crankshaft for present-day engines that will give far greater
      efficiency.<br>
      <br>
      "I call it the magnecrank. It gives more torque with less rpm. It
      has the same stroke, but increased displacement, which means you
      can start from a dead start in high gear", Bokon said.<br>
      <br>
      Getting back to his vapor-dyne motors, he has one that operates
      from external pistons ( outside the block ) and one that operates
      from interior pistons.<br>
      <br>
      The principle is identical in both forms of the motor. Bokon
      explained: "The eight pistons are&nbsp; in a radial block, so at
      least six of them are delivering power at all times.<br>
      <br>
      "The standard engine must complete two revolutions for every power
      stroke but my engine delivers power on every stroke".<br>
      <br>
      Some experts have pointed out that Bokon's idea is similar to the
      Keller "roto-oscillating vane", an externally-powered steam engine
      invented by Leonard Keller and featured in <span
        style="font-style: italic;">Popular Science</span> magazine in
      1974.<br>
      <br>
      "I've studied Keller's engine and the principle is similar to
      mine, but I'm convinced that the vapor-dyne is more efficient",
      Bokon stressed.<br>
      <br>
      In Bokon's design the steam power is generated in a small, closed
      system which eliminates the need for a radiator and elaborate
      cooling system -- another big advantage over present auto engines.<br>
      <br>
      Because the vapor-dyne is so light and has so light and has so few
      moving parts it will be connected directly to the drive wheel, or
      wheels without the need for crankshaft, transmission,
      differential, drive shaft or traditional axles.<br>
      <br>
      A body design, called the BMC ( Bokon Motor Car ) was produced for
      the inventor by Lewis DeSoto, an engineering student from
      University of California, Riverside at the time.<br>
      <br>
      The vehicle is an eight passenger auto that is smaller on the
      outside, yet bigger on the inside than today's compact cars.<br>
      <br>
      "This is because our smaller engine can attach directly to the
      wheel. This also accounts for our remarkable claim of more than 50
      mpg", Bokon said.<br>
      <br>
      The mileage claim has not been proved scientifically, but Bokon's
      laboratory dynomomoter readouts lead him to believe that 50 mpg is
      conservative.<br>
      <br>
      However, by today's standards if his car can get only 30 mpg with
      eight passengers he's miles and miles in front.<br>
      <br>
      His 750 rpm maximum directly to the wheel gives the BMC a highway
      cruising speed of 65 mph.<br>
      <br>
      Thwarted by US industry and government agencies, Bokon finally
      sold the rights to manufacture and market his first vapor-dyne
      engine to Indnesia. This deal was closed in 1975, but so far there
      has been no production.<br>
      <br>
      "The Indonesians built four huge factories and are ready to go,
      but we are balking at how they want to operate. They are seeking
      ways to employ thousnads of people and want to build everything by
      hand, and we think the quality of the machinery would be inferior
      with this method", Bokon said.<br>
      <br>
      Indonesia, the world's fourth largest nation in population and the
      most crowded nation on earth, also has financial problems that
      could hamper the ultimate production and export of the Bokon cars.<br>
      <br>
      "I then designed the second vapor-dyne and patented it so now I
      hope to d business in the US where my work belongs".<br>
      <br>
      It won't be easy, but Bokon is hopeful because some midwestern
      manufacturers have expressed a strong interest. His determinatin
      may pay off -- and we'llall be better off.<br>

        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">1. Field of the Invention</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      This invention relates to energy translating devices and has
      particular reference to combustion engines for driving vehicles,
      such as automobiles, boats, aircraft, etc., as well as stationary
      machinery, such as power generating plants and the like.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">2. Description of the Prior Art</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Heretofore, internal combustion engines embodying pistons, a
      crankshaft and connecting rods pivotally connected between the
      pistons and the crankshaft, have been most commonly used to drive
      both vehicles and stationary machinery. Although such engines are
      generally satisfactory they present certain inherent drawbacks.
      Primarily, they must be operated at a relatively high speed to
      develop necessary power to operate a vehicle and therefore they
      require a relatively complicated and expensive variable speed
      transmission and clutch mechanism to accelerate the vehicle to a
      desired driving speed and to drive the vehicle at different
      speeds. Since internal combustion engines are driven by means of
      timed explosions within the cylinders and because such engines
      incorporate a crankshaft whereby power is transferred to the shaft
      at an uneven rate depending on the harmonic motion resulting from
      pressure of the piston connecting rods against the offset cranks,
      uneven power impulses are applied to the drive shaft, resulting in
      inefficient transfer of energy. Additionally, much of the energy
      is absorbed by virtue of friction within the variable speed
      transmission and associated mechanism.<br>
      <br>
      Further, in a four stroke cycle internal combustion engine, only
      one power stroke occurs during each four strokes or two
      revolutions of the crankshaft, requiring a relatively large number
      of cylinders to obtain a substantially smooth application of
      power. This results in relatively heavy and expensive engines.
      Also, when the fuel-air mixture of an internal combustion engine
      is compressed and ignited in contact with the hot metallic
      elements of the cylinders and other components, such metallic
      surfaces act catalytically to generate nitrous oxides and other
      undesirable air pollutants, commonly known as smog.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      A principal object of the present invention is to provide an
      engine having a relatively high efficiency.<br>
      <br>
      Another object is to provide an engine having a relatively high
      torque at all speeds whereby to eliminate the need for a variable
      speed output transmission when used to propel a vehicle or the
      like.<br>
      <br>
      Another object is to provide a lightweight, compact and yet
      smoothly operating engine.<br>
      <br>
      Another object is to provide a combustion type engine which
      greatly reduces the generation of nitrous oxides and other air
      pollutants.<br>
      <br>
      A further object is to provide a combustion type engine in which
      any type of combustible fuel may be used to convert heat into
      mechanical energy.<br>
      <br>
      A further object is to provide an engine which can alternatively
      be used as a fluid pump.<br>
      <br>
      A further object is to provide a combustion type engine for a
      vehicle in which the engine can be selectively utilized to effect
      regenerative braking.<br>
      <br>
      According to the present invention, a radial external combustion
      engine is provided which utilizes a transfer or drive fluid,
      preferably incorporated in a closed loop system, for driving
      pistons operating in a plurality of radially extending cylinders
      spaced around the engine drive shaft. Such pistons operate drive
      rollers which are guided radially toward the drive shaft and which
      operate in a cam way formed in an output drive member fixed to the
      drive shaft. The drive fluid, preferably in the form of a gas, is
      applied under substantially constant pressure at different times
      to opposite sides of the various pistons in such a manner that
      power is continuously and concurrently applied to all but one
      cylinder at all times, thereby resulting in a constant application
      of relatively high torque at all speeds. This enables the engine
      to be attached directly to a vehicle drive wheel and thus
      eliminates the need for the usual variable speed transmission,
      differential and associated mechanisms. During operation, fuel is
      burned continuously at substantially atmospheric pressure and at a
      relatively low constant temperature which can be controlled to
      reduce the generation of air pollutants. Also, since no octane
      requirements are present, tetraethyl lead and similar additives
      are not required and a wide range of different fuels can be used.<br>
      <br>
      In its preferred form, the engine, when used to propel a vehicle,
      is provided with a manually operable control pedal which actuates
      both a first valve in the fuel system to regulate the flow of fuel
      to a gas generator and a second valve which enables the engine to
      operate as a pump when braking the vehicle so as to pump the drive
      fluid, in gaseous form, into an accumulator where it is stored
      under pressure. Subsequently, upon manipulation of the control
      member, the pressurized drive fluid is released to drive the
      engine.<br>
      <br>
      Although various volatile transfer drive fluids may be used, it is
      preferred to utilize perhalogenated benzene which has a low
      flamability characteristic, minimum corrosive properties and a low
      freezing point. Lubricating oil is preferably incorporated in the
      drive fluid and since such fluid is not subjected to extremely
      high temperature the oil need not be changed or replenished over
      long periods of time.<br>
      <br>

        EMBODIMENT</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Referring to the drawings, the engine of the present invention
      comprises a hexagonally shaped engine block 11 having a centrally
      located set of coaxially aligned bearings 12 for rotatably
      supporting a drive shaft 13. A combined fly wheel and cam disc 15
      is keyed on the shaft 13 and is located closely adjacent the left
      side of the engine block 11 as viewed in FIG. 2. three
      equiangularly spaced cylinders 16, 17 and 18 are attached by bolts
      20 to the block 11 with their axes extending radially outward from
      the shaft 13. Cylinder caps 21 are also attached to the cylinders
      by bolts 20 to hermetically seal the outer ends of the cylinders.
      Pistons 22 having piston rings 23 therearound are slideably fitted
      within the cylinders 16, 17 and 18 and are integrally attached to
      relatively small diameter connecting rods 24. The latter are
      threadably attached at 25 to slides 26 slideably mounted in
      radially extending guide ways 27 formed in the engine block 11. A
      roller 28 (see also FIG. 5) is rotatably supported by each slide
      26 and fits within a cam groove 30 formed in the flywheel 15. The
      groove 30 is cylindrical in shape but formed eccentrically of the
      shaft 13.<br>
      <br>
      Alternatively, the cam groove 30 could be formed oval shaped and
      arranged symmetrically about the shaft 13.<br>
      <br>
      The inner end of each of the cylinders 16 and 18 is closed by a
      plate 31 which is secured in a counterbored section formed in the
      base of the cylinder and has a bearing opening surrounding the
      respective connecting rod 24. A sliding seal 32 hermetically seals
      the inner end of the cylinder around the connecting rod 24.<br>

      Valve means are provided to control the intake of pressurized gas
      into either end of each cylinder and to exhaust the opposite end
      of such cylinders in proper timed relation. for this purpose, a
      valve mechanism generally indicated at 34, FIGS. 2, 3 and 4, is
      provided for each of the cylinders. Such mechanisam is embodied in
      a casing 35 suitably secured to a flattened face 36 formed on the
      respective cylinder, the casing being partitioned into two
      separate spaced intake chambers 37 and 38 by walls 137 and 138 and
      each chamber being further divided by a wall 39 forming a right
      hand intake chamber section and a left hand exhaust chamber
      section (FIG. 3). The right hand section of chamber 37 and the
      right hand section of chamber 38 communicate with the outer and
      inner ends of the respective cylinder through slotted intake ports
      indicated by the dot-dash lines 40 and 41, respectively, in FIG.
      3, and also with respective intake conduits 42 and 43. Likewise,
      the left hand exhaust sections of chambers 37 and 38 communicate
      with the inner and outer ends of the cylinder through slotted
      exhaust ports 46 and 47 and with exhaust conduits 48 and 50,
      respectively. Slide valves 51 and 52 are slidably mounted within
      the casing 35 and are yieldably held against the face 36 of the
      cylinder for controlling the flow of gas to and from the
      cylinders. The valve 51 carries valve heads 53 and 54 at opposite
      ends thereof which are located within the right hand intake
      sections of chambers 37 and 38 and are yieldably held in sealing
      engagement with the face 36 of the cylinder by spring fingers 55
      which slideably engage the outer wall 56 of the casing 35. The
      valve 51 is slideable endwise to concurrently cover one of the
      ports 40 and 41 and uncover the other. Valve 51 has a rack gear 57
      formed thereon and meshing with a drive gear 58 fixed on a rocking
      shaft 60 which is journalled in a bearing 61 formed in the wall 56
      of the valve casing 35.<br>
      <br>
      The valve 52 likewise carries a pair of valve heads 62 and 63 at
      opposite ends thereof which operate within the left hand exhaust
      sections of chambers 37 and 38 to open and close the exhaust ports
      46 and 47. Valve 52 is provided with a rack gear 64 whcih meshes
      with gear 58 on the side thereof opposite the rach gear 57. Thus,
      rocking of the gear 58 shifts the valves 51 and 52 endwise in
      opposite directions to open certain of the ports and close others.<br>
      <br>
      In the position of the parts shown in FIGS. 3, the valve 51
      uncovers intake port 40 and covers intake port 41 while the valve
      52 covers exhaust port 46 and uncovers exhaust port 47. However,
      when the gear 58 is rocked counterclockwise, the valve 51 will
      uncover port 41 and cover port 40 while valve 52 will cover port
      47 and uncover port 46.<br>
      <br>
      Means are provided for operating the various valve mechanisms,
      i.e. 34, for the various cylinders in timed relation to rotation
      of the drive shaft 13 and movement of the pistons 22 in their
      respective cylinders. For this purpose, a hollow rod 65 (FIGS. 2
      and 6) is fastened at its upper end to the gear shaft 60 for the
      valve mechanism 34 associated with cylinder 16 and is slideably
      telescoped over a rod 66 having a bearing at its lower end
      journalled over a crank pin 67 extending from the flywheel 15,
      eccentrically of the shaft 13. Likewise, other telescoping pairs
      68 and 70 of rods are connected between the crank pin 67 and the
      gear shafts for the valve mechanisms associated with the cylinders
      17 and 18. Thus, as the flywheel 15 is rotated, the crank pin 67
      imparts rocking motion to the various drive gears, i.e. 58, to
      shift the valves, i.e. 51 and 52, for the different cylinders
      between their alternate valve port covering and uncovering
      positions.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 8 illustrates schematically the conditions which exist at
      each 60.degree. increment of rotation of the drive shaft 13 and
      flywheel 15. It will be seen that a powr stroke "PS" is applied
      concurrently to the pistons of at least two of the three cylinders
      16, 17 and 18 at all times during each revolution. For example, at
      A, representing the top dead center condition of the piston in
      cylinder 16, pressurized gas is applied to the outer end of the
      cylinder 18 and to the inner end of the cylinder 17, thus
      concurrently driving the pistons of both cylinders to create a
      torque to drive the flywheel 15 in a clockwise direction.
      Concurrently, gas is being exhausted from the inner end of the
      cylinder 18 and from the outer end of the cylinder 17. At B,
      representing the bottom dead center condition of the piston in the
      cylinder 18, which condition is also shown in FIG. 1, pressurized
      gas is concurrently applied to the outer end of cylinder 16 and to
      the inner end of cylinder 17 while the inner end of the cylinder
      16 and the outer end of cylinder 17 are being exhausted.<br>
      <br>
      It will be noted that, unlike a conventional engine having a
      crankshaft and pivoted connecting rods intermediate the pistons
      and the cranks of the crankshaft and wherein a harmonic drive is
      applied in which torque is gradually increased from zero at the
      dead center of the piston to a maximum at midstroke, a constant
      torque is applied through the eccentric cam way 30 to the drive
      shaft 13, resulting in a continuous and uniform transfer of torque
      throughout each revolution of the drive shaft, even at slow
      speeds. Further, the torque is substantially the same regardless
      of the speed at which the engine is driven, this being
      particularly true at extremely slow speeds.<br>
      <br>
      Obviously, there is no dead center position of the engine and it
      may be started under load in any position, thus obviating the need
      of a clutch mechanism between the engine and the load.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 7 illustrates schematically a preferred closed drive system
      for powering the engine. The various intake conduits, i.e. 42, 43,
      for the different valve mechanisma 34 are connected together and
      to a common conduit 70. Likewise, the various exhaust conduits,
      i.e. 48 and 50, are connected together to a common conduit 72.<br>
      <br>
      Perhalogenated benzene is preferably used to generate a
      pressurized vapor for actuating the engine. It is substantially
      liquid form, the fluid is passed through a gas generator 71 where
      it is heated and converted to a gas under pressure. The gas is
      transferred through the conduit line 70 to the various intake
      sections of the valve chambers, i.e. 37 and 38, for the different
      cylinders 16 to 18. On the other hand, the gas exhausted from the
      various cylinders is passed through exhaust conduit 72 and a check
      valve 73. Part of the exhaust gas is transferred to an accumulator
      75 and the remainder is passed through a valve 76 into a condenser
      77 where it is cooled to return it to substantially liquid state
      and it is then passed through an expansion valve 78, and into the
      gas generator to complete the above cycle.<br>
      <br>
      A heat source 80, preferably in the form of a burner, receives a
      combustible fuel from a suitable source (not shown) through an
      intake valve 81 for vaporizing the fluid within the generator 71.<br>
      <br>
      Considering the system as incorporated in a motor vehicle, foot
      control pedal 82 is provided in conjunction with a conventional
      brake system and brake pedal (not shown). Pedal 82 is pivotally
      supported at 33 midway between its ends and is normally held in
      its neutral illustrated position by a spring 84. Pedal 82 is
      connected through linkage 85 to the valve 76 and through a second
      linkge 86 to the fuel control valve 81. Normally, when the pedal
      is in its illustrated neutral position, the valve 76 is open and
      valve 81 is closed. However, when the pedal is depressed clockwise
      to initiate operation of the engine, the valve 76 remains open and
      valve 81 is opened by an amount proportional to the amount of
      depression of the pedal to cause heating of the generator 71 to
      vaporize the fluid therein. When it is desired to brake the
      vehicle, the pedal 82 is depressed in a counterclockwise
      direction, causing actuating linkages 85 and 86 to close the
      valves 76 and 81, respectively, thus enabling the momentum of the
      vehicle to drive the engine. The engine now acts as a pump forcing
      the exhausted gases to pressurize the accumulator 75. The increase
      in pressure in the exhaust line 72 by virtue of the now closed
      valve 76 reacts against the pistons in the cylinders to bring
      about a braking action of the vehicle. Subsequently, in order to
      gain propel the vehicle, the pedal 82 is again rocked clockwise,
      releasing the pressurized gas in the accumulator to pass through
      the condensor 77 and generator 71 to accelerate the vehicle either
      independently of the expansive action of the fluid in generator 71
      or conjointly therewith.<br>

      Although the engine is disclosed as embodying three cylinders, it
      will be obvious that a greater or a lesser number of cylinders
      could be incorporated.<br>
      <br>
      It will be obvious to those skilled in the art that variations may
      be made in the exact construction shown without departing from the
      spirit and scope of the invention. For example, the engine may be
      operated as a pump by applying motive power to the drive shaft.
      Also, although the engine is disclosed as most advantageously
      forming an external combustion engine, it could be modified to
      operate as an internal combustion engine, in which case an
      ignition system, spark plugs and appropriately times intake and
      exhaust valves, all well known in the art, could be incorporated
      with the cylinders, i.e. 16, 17 and 18, to cause exploding gases
      to drive the engine. Accordingly, the term "fluid under pressure"
      in the appended claims is intended to define both fluids which are
      pressurized exteriorly of the cylinders and fluids which are
      pressurized as the result of explosions within the cylinders.<br>
      <br>
      As will be evident to those skilled in the art from the foregoing
      disclosure and accompanying drawings, my illustrated engine is
      versatile as to the direction of rotation of shaft 13. More
      specifically, it is capable of turning the shaft in either
      direction of rotation so as, for example, to cause forward or
      reverse movement of a vehicle on which it is to be mounted for
      use.<br>
