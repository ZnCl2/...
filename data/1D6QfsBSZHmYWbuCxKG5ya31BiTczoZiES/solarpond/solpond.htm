        <big><b>Solar Ponds</b></big><br>
        <br>
      </div>
      A solar pond is a pool of saltwater which acts as a large-scale
      solar thermal energy collector with integral heat storage for
      supplying thermal energy. A solar pond can be used for various
      applications, such as process heating, desalination,
      refrigeration, drying and solar power generation.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Description</b><br>
      <br>
      A solar pond is simply a pool of saltwater which collects and
      stores solar thermal energy. The saltwater naturally forms a
      vertical salinity gradient also known as a "halocline", in which
      low-salinity water floats on top of high-salinity water. The
      layers of salt solutions increase in concentration (and therefore
      density) with depth. Below a certain depth, the solution has a
      uniformly high salt concentration.<br>
      <br>
      There are 3 distinct layers of water in the pond:<br>
      <br>
      The top layer, which has a low salt content.<br>
      <br>
      An intermediate insulating layer with a salt gradient, which
      establishes a density gradient that prevents heat exchange by
      natural convection.<br>
      <br>
      The bottom layer, which has a high salt content.<br>
      <br>
      If the water is relatively translucent, and the pond's bottom has
      high optical absorption, then nearly all of the incident solar
      radiation (sunlight) will go into heating the bottom layer.<br>
      <br>
      When solar energy is absorbed in the water, its temperature
      increases, causing thermal expansion and reduced density. If the
      water were fresh, the low-density warm water would float to the
      surface, causing a convection current. The temperature gradient
      alone causes a density gradient that decreases with depth. However
      the salinity gradient forms a density gradient that increases with
      depth, and this counteracts the temperature gradient, thus
      preventing heat in the lower layers from moving upwards by
      convection and leaving the pond. This means that the temperature
      at the bottom of the pond will rise to over 90 °C while the
      temperature at the top of the pond is usually around 30 °C. A
      natural example of these effects in a saline water body is Solar
      Lake in the Sinai Peninsula of Egypt.<br>
      <br>
      The heat trapped in the salty bottom layer can be used for many
      different purposes, such as the heating of buildings or industrial
      hot water or to drive an organic Rankine cycle turbine or Stirling
      engine for generating electricity.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Advantages and disadvantages</b><br>
      <br>
      The approach is particularly attractive for rural areas in
      developing countries. Very large area collectors can be set up for
      just the cost of the clay or plastic pond liner.<br>
      The evaporated surface water needs to be constantly replenished.<br>
      The accumulating salt crystals have to be removed and can be both
      a valuable by-product and a maintenance expense.<br>
      No need of a separate collector for this thermal storage system.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Efficiency</b><br>
      <br>
      The energy obtained is in the form of low-grade heat of 70 to 80
      °C compared to an assumed 20 °C ambient temperature. According to
      the second law of thermodynamics (see Carnot-cycle), the maximum
      theoretical efficiency of a cycle that uses heat from a high
      temperature reservoir at 80 °C and has a lower temperature of 20°C
      is 1-(273+20)/(273+80)=17%. By comparison, a power plant's heat
      engine delivering high-grade heat at 800 °C would have a maximum
      theoretical limit of 73% for converting heat into useful work (and
      thus would be forced to divest as little as 27% in waste heat to
      the cold temperature reservoir at 20 °C). The low efficiency of
      solar ponds is usually justified with the argument that the
      'collector', being just a plastic-lined pond, might potentially
      result in a large-scale system that is of lower overall levelised
      energy cost than a solar concentrating system.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Development</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Further research is aimed at addressing the problems, such as the
      development of membrane ponds. These use a thin permeable membrane
      to separate the layers without allowing salt to pass through.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Examples</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The largest operating solar pond for electricity generation was
      the Beit HaArava pond built in Israel and operated up until 1988.
      It had an area of 210,000 m² and gave an electrical output of 5
      MW.[1]<br>
      <br>
      The first solar pond in India (6000 sq. metres) was built at Bhuj.
      The project was sanctioned under the National Solar Pond Programme
      by the Ministry of Non-conventional Energy Sources in 1987 and
      completed in 1993 after a sustained collaborative effort by TERI,
      the Gujarat Energy Development Agency, and the GDDC (Gujarat Dairy
      Development Corporation Ltd). The solar pond successfully
      demonstrated the expediency of the technology by supplying 80,000
      litres of hot water daily to the plant. The Energy and Resources
      Institute provided all technical inputs and took up the complete
      execution of research, development, and demonstration. TERI
      operated and maintained this facility until 1996 before handing it
      over to the GDDC. The solar pond functioned effortlessly till the
      year 2000 when severe financial losses crippled GDDC.
      Subsequently, the Bhuj earthquake left the Kutch Dairy
      non-functional.[2]<br>
      <br>
      The 0.8-acre (3,200 m2) solar pond powering 20% of Bruce Foods
      Corporation's operations in El Paso, Texas is the second largest
      in the U.S. It is also the first ever salt-gradient solar pond in
      the U.S.[3]<br>

      <br>
      Here is a pond that contains heat in layers of varied
      temperature—the deeper you delve into it, the hotter it gets,
      seemingly defying a simple heat theory that makes hot-air balloons
      fly. But this is no wonder pond, nor does it fall outside any
      scientific premise. The pond is a large saline water body in which
      solar energy is trapped in the salt. The salt solution gets denser
      with depth, making it possible to maintain a concentrated layer of
      hot brine at the bottom. T ERI researchers built a salt-gradient
      solar pond near Bhuj in Gujarat and put it to a unique use— supply
      process heat to an enduser, for the first time in India.<br>
      <br>
      <b>The heat factory</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Coming back to the heat theory, air or water, when heated, rise as
      they lose weight in the process. In an ordinary water body, when
      sunlight heats up the water, it rises to the surface and loses its
      heat to the atmosphere, keeping the water at nearly atmospheric
      temperature. The solar pond technology inhibits this phenomenon.
      With depth, the salt concentration increases, thereby creating a
      salinity or density gradient at the middle layer—the all-important
      NCZ (non-convective zone). This stable ‘gradient zone’ does not
      allow the less concentrated salt water from the upper convective
      zone at the top to move down and the densely concentrated salt
      water from the lower convective zone at the bottom to move up. The
      NCZ acts as a transparent insulator that lets sunlight reach the
      bottom where it remains entrapped, creating a storehouse of
      thermal energy in the form of hot brine.<br>

      In wake of the looming threat from global warming and also the
      rising scarcity of fossil fuels, there has been an accentuated
      global call for maximizing the use of renewable energy. TERI
      researchers foresaw promising results in the indigenously
      developed salt-gradient solar ponds. The result was the
      construction of the Bhuj solar pond—an idea mooted by a group of
      scientists in 1983.<br>
      <br>
      The project was sanctioned under the National Solar Pond Programme
      by the Ministry of Non-conventional Energy Sources in 1987 and
      completed in 1993 after a sustained collaborative effort by TERI,
      the Gujarat Energy Development Agency, and the GDDC (Gujarat Dairy
      Development Corporation Ltd). TERI provided all technical inputs
      and took up the complete execution of research, development, and
      demonstration. TERI operated and maintained this facility until
      1996 before handing it over to the GDDC. The solar pond functioned
      effortlessly till the year 2000 when severe financial losses
      crippled GDDC. Subsequently, the Bhuj earthquake left the Kutch
      Dairy non-functional.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Scaling new heights</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The Bhuj solar pond covered an area of 6000 aquare metres. The
      Bhuj solar pond project stood out in many regards. The first-ever
      solar pond in India to have connected itself to an end-user –
      supplying industrial process heat to the Kutch Dairy – this pond,
      covering an area of 6000 square metres, was, at that time, the
      largest operating solar pond in the world. Avoiding use of
      imported membrane lining, the project developed a cost-effective,
      indigenous lining scheme, using locally mined clay and plastics.
      While the pond attained a record 99.8 °C under stagnation,
      stability of the salinity gradient was maintained even at such
      elevated temperatures. With only one injection diffuser on one
      side of the pond, the desired salinity profile was achieved even
      at the farthest end. More important, laboratory scale testing and
      the success in catering to actual user-demand have paved way for
      the commercial exploitation of the technology in India.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Carving a niche</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The hot brine – extracted from the bottom of the pond – is pumped
      through a shell-and-tube heat exchanger where it heats water up to
      a temperature of 70 °C. Further, this hot water was delivered to
      the Kutch Dairy plant to be used as pre-heated boiler feed water
      as well as for cleaning and washing. The entire exercise at the
      Bhuj solar pond successfully demonstrated the expediency of the
      technology by supplying 80 000 litres of hot water daily to the
      plant.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Applications/benefits</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The Bhuj experiment significantly placed the solar pond option as
      a comparable alternative to technologies that are in use —
      fossil-fuel-fired process heating and solar flat plate collectors
      for water heating (Box 1).<br>
      <br>
      <b>Opening more windows</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Other than process heating, thermal energy collected in a solar
      pond can be used in many more applications:<br>
      <br>
      Process heat can produce hot air for industrial and space heating
      applications.<br>
      Solar pond-based desalination system offers cost-effective
      solution for production of potable water from brackish/sea water.<br>
      Using the vapour absorption refrigeration system, the heat
      contained in a solar pond can be used for cold storage of food
      products and also for air-conditioning.<br>
      <br>
      The hot brine can also generate electricity, using an organic
      Rankine cycle engine.<br>
      <br>
      The capital and operating costs of the technology are very much
      site- and application-specific. However, these are expected to be
      lower than the competing technologies. For example, the cost of
      heat energy from a solar pond is about 60% of the cost of energy
      from a flat plate solar water-heating system. Process innovation
      like clay– plastic–clay lining reduces the construction cost. With
      suitable government incentives, the technology may soon become one
      of the most viable solar energy options.<br>

      <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Heat has generally been successfully extracted from the lower
      convective zone (LCZ) of solar ponds by two main methods. In the
      first, hot brine from the LCZ is circulated through an external
      heat exchanger, as tested and demonstrated in El Paso and
      elsewhere. In the second method, a heat transfer fluid circulates
      in a closed cycle through an in-pond heat exchanger, as used in
      the Pyramid Hill solar pond, in Victoria, Australia. Based on the
      experiences at the El Paso and Pyramid Hill solar ponds, the
      technical specifications, material selection, stability control,
      clarity maintenance, salt management and operating strategies are
      presented. A novel method of extracting heat from a solar pond is
      to draw the heat from the gradient layer. This method is analysed
      theoretically and results of an experimental investigation at
      Bundoora East, RMIT, are presented. An in-pond heat exchanger made
      of polyethylene pipe has been used to extract heat for over 2
      months. Results indicate that heat extraction from the gradient
      layer increases the overall energy efficiency of the solar pond by
      up to 55%, compared with conventional method of heat extraction
      solely from the LCZ. The experimental results are compared with
      the theoretical analysis. A close agreement has been found. From
      this small-scale experimental study, convection currents were
      found to be localised only and the density profiles were
      unaffected. An experimental study using an external heat exchanger
      for brine extraction and re-injection at different levels within
      the gradient layer still needs to be conducted to determine the
      effect of the heat extraction from the non-convective zone (NCZ)
      on the stability of the salinity gradient (both vertically and
      horizontally) and an economic analysis needs to be conducted to
      determine the economic gains from increased thermal efficiency.<br>

      An aerial photograph of the El Paso solar pond.The El Paso Solar
      Pond project is a research, development, and demonstration project
      initiated by the University of Texas at El Paso in 1983. It has
      operated since May 1986 and has successfully shown that process
      heat, electricity, and fresh water can be produced in the
      southwestern United States using solar pond technology. An organic
      Rankine-cycle engine generator was installed on site in 1986,
      making it the first in the U.S. to generate grid connected power,
      producing up to 70kW. Most of this power has been delivered to
      Bruce Foods Corporation for peak power shaving. This demonstrates
      one of the primary benefits of solar ponds: power on demand --
      even at night or after long periods of cloudy weather.<br>

      </div>
      <br>
      <div align="center"><b>By the MOTHER EARTH NEWS editors</b><b><br>
        </b></div>
      <br>
      In 1980, one of MOTHER EARTH NEWS' technical editors and her tour
      director returned from a wonderfully informative ten-day solar
      tour of Israel jointly sponsored by Jordan College, Solar Age
      magazine, and THE MOTHER EARTH NEWS. The trip was intended to both
      entertain and educate ... and judging from the enthusiastic
      response of the tour group, it fully succeeded on both counts!<br>
      <br>
      One of the most impressive sights of the entire excursion was a
      small power-generating station located at the southern end of the
      Dead Sea... where a considerable amount of electricity is being
      produced using solar energy. You might well assume that the plant
      operates on photovoltaics, but — if that's what you're thinking —
      you'll have to guess again. The new power-generating facility is a
      solar pond ... inexpensive, often naturally occurring phenomena
      that may just hold the secret to a safe and reliable
      middle-technology form of energy production!<br>
      <br>
      Needless to say, MOTHER EARTH NEWS is very interested in any power
      system that delivers a lot for a little. So — in addition to
      reporting on what we saw in Israel — we fully intend to research,
      first hand, the possibility of scaling down both the size and
      technology of the operation ... in order to put it on the "little
      guy's" level, and maybe open up a whole new world of energy
      independence for us all!<br>
      <br>
      As anyone who's worked with solar energy knows, one of the major
      stumbling blocks to a successful "sun" system is the difficulty of
      obtaining effective heat storage, regardless of whether the
      collection medium is air or liquid. (With a fluid system, the
      problem is further compounded by the fact that leakage may be
      disastrous, and equipment costs can be prohibitive.) What's more,
      solar setups of any kind require collectors ... which can often
      mean additional expense and headaches.<br>
      <br>
      So it makes sense that any solar energy system which does away
      with collectors and storage tanks has an obvious advantage over
      the more common techniques. The question is, how can a solar power
      operation get by without what are usually thought of as the two
      most important components? And the answer is ... by using a saline
      pond. Yes, believe it or not, technicians from Ormat Turbines,
      Ltd. — an Israel-based manufacturer of Rankine-cycle drive
      turbines — have developed a system which uses heat that's gathered
      and stored in a pool of salt water to generate up to 150 kilowatts
      of electrical power!<br>
      <br>
      Ormat's entire system is actually quite straightforward. The
      firm's pilot project — located at En Boqeq on the Dead Sea —
      utilizes a man-made pond measuring 75,347 square feet and
      extending to a depth of just over eight feet. This pool is lined
      with a reinforced rubber "skin" that prevents seepage of the briny
      liquid into the ground and into the fresh water table below. (The
      En Boqeq installation uses no insulative layer between the earth
      and the water ... however, under certain conditions, such thermal
      protection may be desirable — in order to maintain optimum water
      temperature — in addition to the brine barrier.)<br>
      <br>
      The pond itself is filled with a dense salt solution, which
      naturally separates into gradient levels: In other words, a weaker
      salt mix exists near the water's surface, and the higher — and
      thus denser — saline concentrations settle to the bottom. The
      topmost layer is, of course, relatively fresh water. As the sun
      beats down on the brine reservoir, its thermal energy passes
      through the "lighter" surface levels and heats the heavy saline
      mass below. Because of the intense density of the solution at the
      bottom of the pond, the mixture resists the convection process
      which would cause mixing, and thus uniform warming, in a body of
      fresh water . . . and the result is that the dense salt solution —
      held at the bottom of the pool and thermally protected by the
      surface layer — can reach temperatures as high as 194°F
      (year-round working temperatures generally fluctuate between 158
      and 176°F). The water at the surface of the pond, of course, stays
      at a warmth that's "normal" for the desert region: between 68 and
      90°F, depending on the season.<br>
      <br>
      In order to take advantage of the heat stored in the salt gradient
      pool, Ormat engineers utilize a three-cycle (evaporation, drive,
      and condensation) system. Here's how it works: The hot salt water
      is pumped through a heat exchanger, which is surrounded by a
      vessel filled with a substance similar to freon. This, in turn, is
      connected to a turbine that's specially designed to be driven by a
      much lower-temperature propellant than that used in a conventional
      steam turbine. Since the medium changes from liquid to gas at a
      relatively low heat, the sun warmed water instantly flashes the
      fluid into a pressurized vapor ... which drives the turbine and
      its 150-kilowatt AC generator.<br>
      <br>
      After the vapor has done its work, it passes on to yet another
      chamber where it's condensed to the liquid stage again by cooler
      water — taken from the surface of the pond — that's pumped into a
      second set of heat exchange tubes within the vessel. The drive
      fluid is then ready to be recycled. In this manner, the
      "refrigerant" fluid — and both the cool and hot water reserves —
      are used repeatedly, within a closed system, to eliminate waste.
      The only liquid that has to be replenished now and then is —
      because of evaporation losses — the upper layer of fresh water.<br>
      <br>
      The beauty of the En Boqeq installation — and of any solar pond —
      is that it will function day and night, winter and summer,
      regardless of whether or not the sun is shining steadily ... since
      the pool provides such a massive heat sink. The Ormat pilot
      project has been so successful, in fact, that the Israeli
      government is working with the firm to build a 5,000kw power
      station that should be completed within two years, and the nation
      eventually hopes to use a 154-square mile portion of the Dead Sea
      to generate enough electricity to supply all of Israel's power
      requirements for the future! (Of course, in a body of water this
      size—and even in a pool as relatively small as the En Boqeq test
      site — winds can cause undesirable disturbances. The problem is
      minimized by the use of plastic nets strung across the surface of
      the pond.)<br>
      <br>
      It's not difficult to imagine that solar ponds might just be the
      "new wave" of alternative energy ... especially since costs
      (calculated by Ormat to be in the $2,000-per-kilowatt range) are
      even now competitive with conventional utility-supplied power. But
      if the technology can be reduced to a "backyard tinkerer's"
      level—and the environmental danger of brine leakage into the water
      table can be eliminated — there's no reason why anyone with even a
      few acres of land can't be totally energy self-sufficient ... or,
      at the very least, enjoy the benefit of reliable solar heat at a
      minimum of cost.<br>

      Apparatus is presented for cultivating aquaculture and mariculture
      crops predominantly in the warm storage zone (SZ) of a durable,
      salt gradient, solar pond. This SZ would be maintained near the
      optimum salinity and temperature for the particular crop and
      especially guarded against overheating. The nonconvective zone
      (NCZ) of this pond would insulate the SZ and buffer diurnal
      temperature oscillations in this SZ. Variations of the basic
      invention include using a partition to separate the SZ and NCZ,
      not using a pond liner, and adding heat from an external source to
      the SZ, such as geothermal or power plant waste heat. Because
      temperature elevations will usually be only 10 DEG to 25 DEG C.,
      it will commonly be possible to insure stable stratification with
      modest salinity changes and to supply sufficient heat from
      directly absorbed solar energy alone. These solar ponds could
      economically provide optimum growing conditions fall through
      spring in temperate latitudes. Three variations are worth
      particularly noting. In solar ponds in dry climates the SZ could
      have a salinity near 12% while the UCZ was near 2%. High salinity
      crops would be cultivated in the SZ such as Artemia, the brine
      shrimp, or Dunaliella, an algae. An attractive variation for
      locations near the shore would use a fresh water UCZ, and
      cultivate marine crops in a seawater SZ. Fresh water crops could
      be cultivated in a fresh water SZ separated by a partition form a
      stable, saline NCZ. All of these ponds could be very inexpensive,
      located outdoors at a wide variety of sites, many of which are now
      not useful, and provide optimum growing conditions and high
      productivity yearround. Moreover cultivating crops in a solar pond
      will require less sophisticated engineering and management of the
      pond than extracting energy from it.<br>

      and water return port 2 is placed near the bottom part of a solar
      pond 10 with each of the position adjusting devices 6a and 6b

      immersed with water, the pump 7 is operated and the water is
      circulated among the heat exchanger 11, tank 8a and solar pond 10
      while salt being supplied to the tank 8a.; When the desired
      concentration is reached, the operation is repeated while the
      water inlet port 1 and the water return port 2 being pulled up by
      the position adjusting devices 6a and 6b and then the
      concentration is gradually decreased. During this operation, the
      pump 7 continues to operate and the amount of feeding of salt, a
      pulling-up speed of the water inlet port 1 and the water return
      port 2 are merely adjusted. Therefore, it is possible to make a

      PURPOSE: To lower the running cost of a solar pond, by employing
      such an arrangement that a required temperature gradient is formed
      spontaneously in the solar pond. CONSTITUTION:&nbsp; A solar pond
      of this invention is constructed by blackening the bottom surface
      5 of a water tank by use of asphalt or the like, extending a
      longitudinal finned tube 6 horizontally above the bottom surface
      5, accumulating crystals 7 of salts blackened by way of a special
      treatment over the surface of the bottom surface 5, filling a
      saturated salt solution 8 above the crystals 7 of salts, forming a
      layer of fresh water 9 above the solution 8. With such an
      arrangement, drastic change of concentration is formed at the
      interface between the solution 8 and the layer 9 of fresh water,
      and the layer 9 of fresh water functions to insulate heat and also
      to cause the above concentration change continuously.; The solar
      heat is absorbed at the bottom surface 5 and raise the temperature
      of ambient salt solution 8, which causes further eluation of
      crystals 7, so that a certain concentration gradient is formed
      spontaneously in the vicinity of the bottom surface 5. Thus,
      low-temperature water A is heated by the tube 6 and

      The present invention resides in a method and apparatus for
      maintaining a substantially constant salt density gradient in a
      non-convecting salt gradient pond. The apparatus for carrying out
      the method of the present invention enables one to maintain a
      substantially constant salt density gradient automatically in a
      highly efficient, simple and economic manner.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      The present invention resides in a falling pond method for
      maintaining a salt density gradient in a non-convecting salt
      gradient pond, i.e., falling solar pond, and means for carrying
      out said method.<br>
      <br>
      A non-convecting solar pond is an efficient and relatively
      inexpensive energy collection and storage system. The design of a
      solar pond is such that it takes advantage of several important
      properties of water, namely, high heat capacity, transparency to
      visible and ultraviolet light, opacity to infrared radiation and
      poor heat conductivity.<br>
      <br>
      The general principles involved in designing a solar pond are
      relatively simple. A body of water collects large amounts of heat
      from the sun. Ordinarily the water temperature remains close to
      the ambient air temperature because the heating of the water
      produces a convection circulation which brings the absorbed heat
      to the surface where it is dissipated into the air, largely by
      evaporation. It has been found that by establishing a salt density
      gradient which increases with depth, convection circulation can be
      inhibited thereby greatly reducing loss of heat at the surface of
      the pond.<br>
      <br>
      For most ordinary uses, such as space heating or industrial
      process heating, a solar pond should be between two and three
      meters deep and at least a few hundred square meters in size. The
      top layer of the pond has little or no salt dissolved therein and
      the concentration of salt increases with depth until a density
      gradient layer is established which is between one and one and a
      half meters deep. Below this gradient region is the heat storage
      region which is generally of constant density equal to the density
      of the lowermost region of the salt gradient region. The storage
      region may be in direct contact with the gradient region or
      separated therefrom by means of transparent membrane such as
      plastic or the like in which case the storage region could be salt
      free. The choice between a direct contact or a separate storage
      region depends on the relative cost of the salt and plastic. In
      either case, convection is permitted and in fact is desirable in
      the heat storage region.<br>
      <br>
      While salt gradient solar ponds are the most cost effective solar
      thermal system and can provide useful heat at a cost that is less
      than most conventional methods, the concept has remained largely
      undeveloped. The principal reason for this lack of development
      resides in the problems encountered in attempting to maintain the
      salt density gradient which, if left alone, tends to diffuse away
      leaving a pond of uniform salinity thereby resulting in convection
      circulation and a corresponding loss of heat.<br>
      <br>
      Heretofore, one method used to maintain the salt gradient has been
      simply to add salt to the bottom layers of the pond while flushing
      the top layers of brine away with fresh water. This method, while
      simple, suffers from a number of disadvantages the most important
      of which are added cost for the additional salt and lack of
      automatic means for determining when salt must be added. While the
      movement of salt upward from the bottom layers is rather slow, on
      the order of 0.3 mm per day, a large amount of salt, about 18,000
      kg per year, is still needed in order to maintain the proper
      density gradient in a quarter acre pond. The added expense for the
      salt coupled with the need for a continual personal surveillance
      in order to predict when salt must be added has prohibited this
      method for becoming commercially feasible.<br>
      <br>
      A second method previously employed to maintain the salt gradient
      in a solar pond comprises removing the top layer of water from the
      pond which has become salty due to diffusion and transporting it
      to a holding evaporation pond where the water is allowed to
      evaporate after which the more concentrated salt solution is
      returned to the bottom layer of the pond. While this method
      overcomes the disadvantage of requiring extra salt to maintain the
      gradient, it requires a large amount of space for the evaporation
      pond and still requires constant surveillance on the part of
      personnel in order to determine when the salt water must be
      removed and returned.<br>
      <br>
      A third method which has been suggested by Dr. Harry Tabor uses a
      flash evaporator to perform the same function as the evaporation
      pond discussed above. This particular method has been untried to
      date due to the considerable expense of the flash evaporator and
      the complicated system required to employ same. Again, as with the
      previously discussed methods constant surveillance is required to
      determine when salt should be added. In addition to the foregoing
      drawbacks, all of the above-noted methods correct the salt
      gradient only after a significant amount of salt has reached the
      surface, i.e. when the salinity gradient has already decayed
      substantially thereby increasing the likelihood of convection.<br>
      <br>
      Naturally, it would be highly desirable to provide a method for
      maintaining a substantially constant salt gradient in a solar pond
      which eliminates the extra cost of adding additional salt and at
      the same time automatically controls the salt gradient thereby
      eliminating any convective heat loss.<br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, it is the principal object of the present invention
      to provide a method for maintaining a substantially constant salt
      density gradient in a non-convecting solar pond.<br>
      <br>
      It is a further object of the present invention to provide a
      method as outlined above which is fully automatic.<br>
      <br>
      It is a still further object of the present invention to provide a
      method as outlined above which is of simple and inexpensive
      construction.<br>

      Further objects and advantages of the present invention will

      carrying out the method of the present invention enables one to
      maintain a substantially constant salt density gradient
      automatically in a highly efficient, simple and economic manner.<br>
      <br>
      In accordance with the present invention, a solar pond is provided
      with a spillway which acts as an evaporator. Pumps are
      automatically actuated in response to various predetermined
      conditions for feeding salty water to the spillway where the water
      trickles down the spillway toward a catch basin where it is
      collected. The exposure of the salt water to the sun and air
      results in evaporation of the water as it progresses toward the
      catch basin. The concentrated brine received in the catch basin is
      then pumped back into the pond preferably at the base of the salt
      density gradient region, that is, at the interface of gradient
      region and the heat storage region of the solar pond. Automatic
      means are provided for adding fresh water to the top of the pond
      to replace that water lost as a result of the evaporation process.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, is can be seen that the method and apparatus of the present
      invention provides a simple, inexpensive and automatic arrangement
      for maintaining a substantially constant salt density gradient in
      a non-convecting salt gradient pond. By employing the method and
      apparatus of the present invention disadvantages associated with
      prior art solar ponds are overcome thereby increasing the
      commercial feasibility of solar ponds as an energy source.<br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b><br>
      <br>
      Referring to FIG. 1, a solar pond 10 is illustrated which is
      constructed by excavating a pit and employing the removed dirt to
      form raised banks around the pond proper. The pit is lined with
      plastic and is filled with water, and a salt density gradient is
      thereafter established. The top region 12 of the pond is
      substantially salt free. The salt density gradient 14 is
      established beneath the fresh water region 12. As noted previously
      the density in region 14 increases with the depth of the pond. The
      heat storage region 16 is located beneath the gradient region 14
      and may be, as noted earlier, either in direct contact with or
      separated from the gradient region by a transparent membrane. For
      purposes of illustration and for describing the method of the
      present invention the salt gradient region is shown in direct
      contact with the heat storage region. If the heat storage region
      is in direct contact with the gradient region, the concentration
      of the heat storage region should be approximately equal to the
      density of salt at the bottom of the salt gradient region. If on
      the other hand the regions are separated by a membrane, the
      storage region may be salt free water. On at least one of the
      raised banks, preferably the bank having southern exposure, the
      trickle evaporator 18 of the present invention is constructed.<br>
      <br>
      In accordance with the present invention, as can best be seen in
      FIGS. 1 and 2, the trickle evaporator 18 comprises a sloped graded
      spillway 20 which is sloped at an angle equal to the geographic
      latitude plus or minus up to 15 DEG. The slope is covered with any
      material which will withstand exposure to heat, brine and oxygen
      and at the same time allow for substantially evan flow of the salt
      water down the spillway. A preferred material for covering
      spillway 20 would be plastic sheeting, preferably plastic sheeting
      which is dark in color so as to maximize the effort of the sun in
      promoting evaporation. Other suitable covering materials include
      masonry and metal products.<br>
      <br>
      At the top of the spillway 20 is a trough 22 which receives the
      brine from a water distributing perforated pipe 24 which is in
      fluid communication with the heat storage region 16 in the case of
      direct contact or with the bottom of salt gradient region 14 in
      the case of separated regions by means of fluid line 26. A fluid
      pump 28 is provided in fluid line 26 for removing the brine from
      the heat storage region 16 or bottom of salt gradient region 14
      and delivering same to the distributing perforated pipe 24 where
      the water is distributed over the length of the spillway 20. The
      fluid pump 28 is responsive to and actuated by a pump drive motor
      which senses environmental conditions and actuates the fluid pump
      upon sensing certain predetermined values of the monitored
      environmental conditions. In accordance with a preferred
      embodiment of the present invention, pump 28 is responsive to
      either ambient temperature or the degree of sunlight or both. The
      values of the light intensity, I, and ambient temperature, T,
      which activate fluid pump 28 are selected so that the pump 28 is
      activated at a time when evaporation would be efficiently carried
      out. Thus, if the ambient temperature (T) is too low and/or the
      amount of sunshine (I) too little, the pump system will not be
      activated. The system will be activated in two cases, i.e., where
      I&gt;Io and T&gt;Tmin or when I&gt;Imin and T&gt;To where Io
      &gt;Imin. The particular sensing means employed may be selected
      from any of a number of commercial sensing means which are readily
      available such as thermostats, light sensitive eyes, etc., and the
      detailed structure of said sensing means forms no part of the
      instant invention. Alternatively, one could sense the relative
      humidity rather than temperature and light intensity to activate
      the control sequences. This could be done by employing dry and wet
      bulb sensing devices in conjunction with a microprocessor to
      compute relative humidity.<br>
      <br>
      As noted above, the brine delivered to pipe 24 by pump 28 is
      distributed over the entire length of the spillway 20 and trickles
      down the spillway where a substantial amount of evaporation of
      water takes place. A receiving trough 30 is provided at the bottom
      of the spillway to collect the concentrated brine. The trough has
      sloping side walls which feed the collected brine to a catch basin
      32 where the brine, under appropriate conditions, is fed by pump
      34 to one or more locations in the pond below the gradient region
      14, preferably just below the interface between regions 14 and 16
      in a direct contact pond or at the bottom of region 14 in a
      separated region pond, via feed line 36. It is preferred that pump
      34 be activated automatically upon actuation of fluid pump 28. In
      addition, pump 34 is preferably provided with an automatic
      override control which prohibits pump operation upon sensing that
      the catch basin 32 is empty so as to prohibit damage to the pump
      34. It is a critical feature of the present invention that the
      catch basin 32 be small in size so that it does not collect a
      substantial amount of fresh rain water which would tend to dilute
      the brine. Preferably, the catch basin is sized so that excess
      rain water will overflow and run away from the pond. It should be
      appreciated that, depending on the size of the pond, a plurality
      of feed lines and pumps may be employed for removing brine and
      returning concentrated brine to the regions of the solar pond so
      as to maintain a homogeneous concentration.<br>
      <br>
      As water is lost through the evaporation process, the height of
      the solar pond falls. In accordance with the falling pond method,
      fresh water is automatically added to the top region 12 of pond 10
      by means of pump 38 which is responsive to the level of water in
      the pond 10. Pump 38 may be controlled by float means, electrodes,
      or any other suitable means. As the water level in the pond
      decreases pump 38 is activated to reestablish the water level. It
      can be seen that the continual addition of fresh water to the top
      of region 12 of solar pond 10 in combination with the lowering of
      the gradient region 14 due to the extraction of heated brine from
      the region 16 results in the maintenance of a tri-layered pond
      whereby the salt gradient density is controlled and maintained by
      recirculating the collected brine to the interface between the
      heat region 16 and the bottom of the gradient region 14 in the
      case of direct contact regions or to the bottom of gradient region
      14 in the case of separated gradient regions. The pond is provided
      with an overflow lip 40 for removing excess water from the pond
      which may occur due to excessive rainfall.<br>
      <br>
      In accordance with the present invention a hydrometer is employed
      to monitor the density gradient of the solar pond to assure that
      the evaporation system of the present invention is operating
      properly. It is highly desirable that the hydrometer be observed
      without the necessity of removing it from the pond or of removing
      water samples from the pond as the act of extracting is likely to
      stir the water and thereby affect the density gradient. In a
      preferred embodiment as illustrated in FIGS. 3A-C the hydrometer
      50 consists of a transparent cylinder 52 made of glass, plastic or
      the like which is provided with a plurality of perforations 54
      over the entire surface thereof which allows the water in the
      gradient region to readily pass into the interior of the cylinder
      52. A graduated scale 56 is ruled on cylinder 52. It should be
      appreciated that the length of the hydrometer 50 should be
      sufficient to monitor the entire depth of the gradient region. The
      interior of cylinder 52 is filled with a plurality of differently
      colored floating objects 58 such as spheres. Each of the objects
      has a different specific gravity chosen so that the order and
      vertical separation form an easily recognizable pattern which may
      be seen from the surface of the pond and compared to a key to
      determine if the gradient is correct. The color coding allows the
      observer to determine whether the objects 58 are floating in the
      correct order and thus determine if there are any reversed density
      levels. The separation between the objects 58 indicates the
      density gradient. Thus, the hydrometer 50 of the present invention
      differs from known hydrometers in that it shows not only the
      specific gravity at any location but also the relative density
      gradient. The specific size of the floating objects 58 is
      critical. Naturally, the objects must be large enough so as to be
      readily observed from the surface of the pond. Likewise, it is
      critical that the objects be small enough to be affected by small
      scale density variations. Furthermore, the size of the objects
      should be such that they can readily pass over each other in the
      cylinder 52 in the event of any reversed density levels. In the
      case of spheres, it has been found that a diameter of from 0.25 cm
      to 2.00 cm is useful.<br>
      <br>
      Alternatively, the hydrometer may be replaced by an immersed array
      of electrodes which would measure the electrical conductivity of
      the salt solution and thereby the gradient concentration.<br>
      <br>
      It should be appreciated that the system of the present invention
      may be used in conjunction with a concentrating solar collector
      such as parabolic mirrors or evaporators having external heat
      sources in the event of extended cold or cloudy periods. This
      supplemental system would fit into the pump system in parallel
      with the trickle evaporator and generally would be used sparingly
      if at all.<br>
      <br>
      It is difficult to predict the exact water evaporation rate for a
      certain location and time because the rate depends on a
      combination of factors, including water temperature, air
      temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and insolation energy.
      The following calculations will show, however, that the designed
      system of the present invention will concentrate the brine
      sufficiently for reasonable evaporator areas and flow rates. In
      the system of the present invention the pump controls are set to
      provide the correct flow rate for the particular characteristics
      of the solar pond.<br>
      <br>
      The exact upward salt transport rate depends on various factors
      such as the overall temperature gradient and concentration
      gradient in the pond. Measurements taken in existing solar ponds
      show an average transport rate of about 0.06 kg/m@2 /day for a
      typical pond (see for example, Carl E. Nielsen "Control of
      Gradient Zone Boundaries" in International Solar Energy Society
      Annual Meeting Proceedings, Atlanta, May, 1979). To maintain a 20%
      salt solution in the storage region, it is necessary to remove 5
      times that much fresh water from the convecting storage region. In
      other words, the pond must fall 0.30 mm/day. Thus, one must
      evaporate about 100 kg/m@2 /year (0.08 gal/day). For example, in
      an 850 m@2 pond in the middle Atlantic states, if one were to
      correct for the upward motion of the salt by adding new salt to
      the bottom and flushing the top with fresh water, as is the case
      with known prior art, one would need to add approximately 20.0
      tons of salt. If on the other hand, one were to use the system of
      the present invention, it would be necessary to evaporate about 68
      gallons of water per day by means of the trickel evaporator. For
      standing water with a free surface (such as a lake) the rate of
      evaporation is given by the empirical formula (found in a number
      of sources; for example, J. T. Czarnecki, Swimming Pool
      Heating--TR19, Highett, Victoria, Australia 1978).<br>
      Mevap =(7.2.times.10@-3) (3.1+4.1V) (Pw -Pa)<br>
      M=evaporated water in (grams/M@2)/second<br>
      V=wind velocity in meters/second<br>
      Pw =vapor pressure of water at temperature Tw in kilopascals (kPa)<br>
      Pa =partial water vapor pressure of air at Ta and relative
      humidity RH<br>
      Pa =Psaturated .times.RH.div.100 (kilopascals)<br>
      <br>
      For solar pond trickle evaporation assume<br>
      Tw =52 DEG C.<br>
      Pw =100 mm Hg=13.60 kPa<br>
      Ta =16 DEG C.; RH=60%<br>
      Pa =8.0 mm Hg=1.10 kPa<br>
      V=2 m/second<br>
      Mevap =1 gram/meter@2 /second=0.95 gal/hr./m@2<br>
      <br>
      To evaporate 68 gallons one needs 70.0 (m@2) (hours) of exposure,
      or in other words 30 m@2 of surface of water at that temperature
      exposed for 2.3 hours or an equivalent combination of surface area
      and exposure time, such that Area.times.Time=70 m@2 hr. This
      estimate of evaporation rate is based only on stagnant air
      contact. However, because the water is flowing down the spillway
      in the present invention evaporation is enhanced somewhat. Solar
      insolation (which is generally greater than 300 cal/cm@2 /day on
      an annual average in central latitudes) will increase this
      evaporation rate by about 30%. Furthermore, higher water
      temperature, higher wind velocity, or lower relative humidity, all
      of which are not unlikely for a typical pond, will give faster
      evaporation rates. The flow rate necessary to accomplish the
      evaporation of 68 gallons per day would be at least 300 gallons
      per day and usually about 600 gallons per day, flowing across the
      trickle evaporator, i.e. a few gallons per minute.<br>
      <br>
      The principle disadvantage with the system of the present
      invention is that the evaporation process drains heat from the
      pond, but the amount of heat removed is tolerable. Furthermore,
      the heat loss is somewhat mitigated by the fact the pond is more
      stable as well as more efficient when kept at a lower temperature.
      In spite of the heat loss this system is economically preferable
      to known alternatives.<br>
      <br>
      It is to be understood that the invention is not limited to the
      illustrations described and shown herein, which are deemed to be
      merely illustrative of the best modes of carrying out the
      invention, and which are susceptible of modification of form,
      size, arrangement of parts and details of operation. The invention
      rather is intended to encompass all such modifications which are
      within its spirit and scope as defined by the claims.<br>

      <br>
      The concentration of the solute in solution in a saturated
      non-convecting solar pond is greatest at a lower hotter level
      decreases continuously toward a higher cooler level and is
      saturated at all levels, thus preventing solute diffusion. In the
      customary operation of such saturated non-convecting solar ponds,
      the heat generated by incident radiation is absorbed in a bottom
      or lower layer. Because of the continuously decreasing density of
      solute which is near saturation from the lower to the upper
      layers, there is little salt convection and the pool tends to be
      further stabilized. Further, by heating due to absorption of the
      radiation largely at the lower level, a temperature gradient is
      maintained in which the upper layers remain cool, evaporation and
      consequent loss of heat is inhibited and the efficiency of the
      solar pond is improved. It has been discovered that a brine
      consisting essentially of an appropriate mixture of sodium
      carbonate (Na2CO3) and sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) as a solute in
      water is an especially desirable solution for use in a saturated
      non-convecting solar pond. A cover material may be used as a
      barrier material over the solution to impede carbon dioxide
      transfer across the solution surface.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      One means for collecting solar energy is a solar pond. A solar
      pond may be defined as "a shallow artificial black bottom pond or
      lake in which the incident solar insolation is converted into a
      local temperature rise in the water near the bottom." (Mehta, G.
      D., "Non-Convecting Solar Ponds", Technical Report ETG-4,
      Hydronautics, Inc., Oct., 1975). A successful solar pond should
      develop simultaneously a high temperature at the bottom of the
      pond as a result of the radiation and a low temperature at the
      top. The low temperature is desirable to minimize excessive energy
      losses through evaporation, conduction and radiation.<br>
      <br>
      The objective of high temperature at the bottom and low
      temperature at the top cannot be readily achieved, if at all, by
      using a pond containing water alone. With water alone, the higher
      temperature at the bottom of the pond decreases the density of the
      liquid relative to that at the surface, thus causing convection
      currents which quickly equalize the water temperatures. These
      density convection currents can be eliminated by introducing a
      density gradient maintained by a suitable salt concentration
      gradient. Such ponds are referred to as non-convecting solar
      ponds. They have been tested and studied rather extensively.<br>
      <br>
      One of the advantages of the non-convecting solar pond is that it
      has a substantial storage capacity. It has been estimated that the
      solar pond could have a storage capacity of as much as 31 days,
      i.e. deliver substantial thermal energy for this period without
      incident sunlight.<br>
      <br>
      The advantage of the storage capacity plus other advantages, such
      as low cost, make the non-convecting solar pond a promising
      candidate for the collection of unfocussed solar energy. On the
      other hand, there are certain disadvantages at present, the major
      one of which is maintaining the salt concentration gradient
      necessary for pond stability. The very existence of a salt
      concentration gradient causes salt diffusion which tends to
      destroy the gradient. The salt diffusion occurs because the brine
      is unsaturated at all levels with the salts usually used, such as
      NaCl or MgCl2, for which solubility is relatively insensitive to
      temperature. With such salts the saturation concentration is
      relatively constant over the substantial temperature range which
      usually prevails from the top to the bottom of the pond.
      Therefore, the brine is at a lower concentration relative to
      saturation at the upper, cooler level than at the lower, warmer
      levels, and diffusion of salt can proceed unimpeded. It has been
      suggested (Styris, D. L., et al, "The Non-Convecting Solar
      Pond--an Overview of Technological Status and Possible
      Applications", Battelle Pacific Northwest Laboratories, Report
      BNWL-1891-UC-13, Jan., 1975), that the problem of diffusion could
      be largely solved if the pond were substantially saturated with a
      salt having a solubility which is a direct function of
      temperature. In such a saturated non-convecting solar pond
      (saturated pond for short), one way of viewing the resultant
      action is that the salt could no longer diffuse successfully to a
      less concentrated (cooler) region because it would move to an
      already-saturated region, causing it to precipitate and sink to
      the hotter, now unsaturated region where it would redissolve. The
      saturated pond should be self-generating (assuming some
      temperature gradient always exists from the extra solar radiation
      absorbed near the bottom), self-maintaining, and self-repairing,
      all qualities which unsaturated ponds do not possess. Thus the
      saturated pond should be simpler in construction and operation
      than the unsaturated pond. Unfortunately, no saturated solar pond
      has been built because of the apparent lack of a
      temperature-sensitive solute that is cheap, stable, nontoxic,
      transparent, available in large quantities and the average
      solubility of which, over the pond temperature range of 20 DEG to
      100 DEG C. is not too high. For example, ammonium nitrate (NH4
      NO3) and potassium nitrate (KNO3), have been considered for a
      saturated solar pond. The curves of FIG. 1 for these compounds are
      derived from data from Perry Chemical Engineer's Handbook, 4th
      Edition. With KNO3, for example, the high cost and high average
      solubility over the desired temperature range are such that the
      KNO3 for a saturated solar pond would cost in the order of 100
      dollars per square meter of pond surface for a typical pond depth
      of one meter. Such a cost is prohibitively expensive, when it is
      realized that capital cost in one of the chief contributions to
      the cost of operating a solar pond. In comparison, with an
      unsaturated solar pond using Mg Cl2 or NaCl, the salt would cost
      in the order of 10 dollars per square meter of pond surface.<br>

      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      According to the invention, a saturated non-convecting solar pond
      uses a saturated brine consisting preferably of a mixture of
      sodium carbonate (Na2 CO3) and sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) in
      water together with a transparent cover on the pond surface to
      impede transfer of carbon dioxide. The utility of mixtures of Na2
      CO3 and NaHCO3 is an unexpected and unforeseen result in view of
      the fact that neither Na2 CO3 by itself nor NaHCO3 by itself would
      be satisfactory, as discussed in the following detailed
      description.<br>

      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DISCLOSED EMBODIMENT</b><br>
      <br>
      Sodium bicarbonate by itself has a fairly desirable solubility
      curve extending from about 10 wt. % at 30 DEG C. to about 14% at
      60 DEG C. (FIG. 2). Unfortunately, sodium bicarbonate tends to
      dissociate in water solution into sodium carbonate, water and
      carbon dioxide. Therefore, sodium bicarbonate is not a suitable
      material to form the desired brine. On the other hand, sodium
      carbonate in solution absorbs carbon dioxide, and its solubility
      is rather insensitive to temperature in the desired range, of say
      approximately 30 DEG to 100 DEG C., as shown in FIG. 2.<br>
      <br>
      We have found that the density of a brine formed by an appropriate
      mixture of sodium bicarbonate and sodium carbonate increases with
      increase in temperature, the solubility at saturation of the
      mixture increases with temperature, and the average solubility is
      not too great. Furthermore, in such an appropriate mixture, the
      dissolution of sodium bicarbonate by CO2 loss is suppressed by the
      presence of the sodium carbonate and can be virtually eliminated
      by use of a transparent pond cover. The cover can be made of a
      material which acts as a barrier to CO2 transmission and may
      consist of a plastic film or alternatively a monomolecular liquid
      film. Some of the desirable qualities of the mixture are shown in
      FIG. 2 and FIG. 3, as exemplified by a 1.9/1 by weight (3:2 ratio
      in mols) mixture of sodium carbonate and sodium bicarbonate.
      However, it is not intended to imply that this is the only
      appropriate ratio, a 2/1 mixture and other ratios being adequate.
      Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the limits of the
      value of this ratio are imposed by saturated pond requirements and
      the characteristics of Na2 CO3 /NaHCO3 mixtures in solution.<br>
      <br>
      We prefer a mixture of about 1.9 to 1 by weight of Na2 CO3 to
      NaHCO3 or about a three to two (3:2) molar ratio as exemplary for
      the purposes expressed herein. FIG. 2 shows the weight percent of
      an anhydrous solute in a saturated solution plotted against the
      temperature of the saturated solution in degrees centigrade for
      sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3), a 1.9/1(3:2 mols) mixture of sodium
      carbonate (Na2 CO3) and sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3), and sodium
      carbonate (Na2 CO3). The curve for sodium bicarbonate terminates
      at about 60 DEG C. at which point the sodium bicarbonate
      dissociates freely, liberating carbon dioxide. The curve for
      sodium carbonate shows that its solubility somewhat decreases and
      then becomes practically constant with temperature above about 30
      DEG C. or a little over. This characteristic makes the use of
      sodium carbonate by itself in a saturated non-convecting solar
      pond impractical.<br>
      <br>
      On the other hand, the 1.9/1 mixture is substantially stable at
      high temperatures, particularly if a transparent pond cover
      relatively impermeable to CO2 is used, and shows a regular
      increase in saturation concentration (and solution density) as the
      temperature increases. Conversely as the saturated 1.9/1 solution
      decreases in temperature, salt would tend to be precipitated. If
      the vertical decreases of temperature in a pond were from a lower
      level to a higher level in a saturated 1.9/1 solution, this
      characteristic would tend to prevent diffusional mixing and the
      layers would tend to remain intact, each at its own weight percent
      of the solute in saturation at the temperature of the particular
      layer under consideration. The curve for Trona (1:1 molar ratio)
      is shown for comparison. Trona, Na2 CO3.NaHCO3.2H2 O, is also
      known as sodium sesquicarbonate.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 3 shows the curve for the density of the saturated 1.9/1 (3:2
      molar ratio) solution described above at saturation temperature in
      grams per cubic centimeter plotted against the temperature of the
      saturated solution in degrees centigrade. The density increases
      progressively from about 30 DEG C. to near 90 DEG C. The curve for
      Trona (1:1 molar ratio) is shown for comparison. The foregoing
      shows that an appropriate mixture of sodium carbonate with sodium
      bicarbonate is an outstanding solute for use in a saturated
      non-convecting solar pond system. The density of the saturated
      solution increases adequately with an increase in temperature. The
      average solubility is sufficiently low so that an inordinately
      large quantity of the salt is not required to achieve the
      saturated solution. Moreover, the solution is substantially
      transparent and nontoxic. Transparency in solution is essential in
      order that the pond may be insolated with some efficiency. The
      sodium bicarbonate in the solution is relatively stable against
      carbon dioxide liberation because of the presence of adequate
      sodium carbonate and is made more stable by a transparent pond
      cover relatively impermeable to CO2. Moreover, the dual salt
      mixture is inexpensive and is available in large quantities. It
      can be made from sodium carbonate and Trona, which is cheap and
      plentiful and available from several sources. One well known
      source is at Green River, Wyoming. The Trona from that source is
      about 95% pure by weight as mined and large quantities are secured
      with a relatively simple mining and crushing operation. Quite pure
      Trona is obtained from this Trona ore by a cheap, mass-production
      operation, as a prelude to sodium carbonate production. It is
      estimated that an appropriate 1.9/1 by weight mixture of Na2 CO3
      and NaHCO3 in a saturated pond one meter deep would cost in the
      order of 10 dollars per square meter, a cost similar to that of
      salts (such as NaCl, MgCl2) presently used in unsaturated ponds.<br>
      <br>
      Referring to FIG. 4, a solar pond 1 receives solar radiation 12.
      The bottom layer 14 is preferably black to absorb a large fraction
      of the solar radiation and convert it to heat. The top of the pond
      is preferably covered with a transparent plastic cover 10 such as
      "nitrile barrier" film (p. 32, Modern Plastics Encyclopedia, Vol.
      52, No. 10A) which will impede the loss of generated CO2 and
      collect it at the brine surface at a gaseous pressure less than
      atmospheric pressure, but sufficient to achieve equilibrium with
      the partial pressure of CO2 in the liquid solution. The heat from
      the bottom layer may be converted to energy by any suitable heat
      exchange mechanism such as one or more coils 15 arranged in heat
      exchange relationship with the lowermost layer 18 of the solution
      in the pond. Alternatively the lowermost layer of the pond may be
      pumped outside of the pond to supply heat for heating purposes or
      to operate an engine producing mechanical or electrical energy
      (See for example, the Styris, et al Battelle Report 1891 cited
      above).<br>
      <br>
      The concentration and density gradients are self-generating. It is
      merely necessary to place in the pond sufficient quantities of the
      appropriate Na2 CO3 /NaHCO3 mixture, such as the 1.9/1 by weight
      mixture, so that there will be a slight excess when final
      equilibrium is established. The incident solar energy on water
      added through supply pipe 20 will create an initial temperature
      difference. The 1.9/1 mixture will dissolve accordingly, setting
      up a slight concentration and hence density gradient. This density
      gradient will inhibit convection, thus encouraging a greater
      temperature difference, more dissolution, a greater concentration
      and density gradient, etc., until the pond is completely
      saturated. Alternatively, a cool, near saturation weak solution
      may be fed into the bottom zone, through inlet pipe 16, then
      slowly a warmer, more concentrated solution which will lift the
      weaker solution and so forth until a step-like density gradient
      has been produced.<br>
      <br>
      Alternatively, a solution of different density may be added in the
      reverse order from the top either through a supply pipe 26 or by
      using the flexible hose 20. It may be desirable to add some water
      on the surface of the pond 10 through the supply pipe 26 in order
      to prevent or reduce loss of liquid by evaporation.<br>
      <br>
      After a period of insolation the pond will have a temperature
      gradient substantially as desired with a substantial rise in
      temperature at the bottom and almost no rise in temperature at the
      surface which will approach the ambient temperature. There being
      no convection in the liquid, the transfer of heat from the bottom
      to the top will be solely by conduction, which is relatively
      small. The desired concentration, density, and temperature
      gradients should then be maintained. These limits on density and
      temperature can be determined from the probable temperature limits
      at the top of 25 DEG C. to 100 DEG C. at the bottom. The heat
      absorbed by such a pool may be used as described in this patent or
      any other suitable way suggested in the prior art, as in the
      Styris, et al report cited above.<br>
      <br>
      In the on-going operation of the pond, there may be CO2 losses at
      a low rate. To make up for such losses NaHCO3 can be added at the
      same time that high alkalinity solution is removed.<br>
      <br>
      It will be clear from the foregoing that there has been described
      a highly desirable non-convecting solar pond which uses a
      saturated brine solution of an appropriate mixture of sodium
      carbonate and sodium bicarbonate. Such a system has substantial
      advantages over unsaturated non-convecting solar ponds and over
      saturated non-convecting solar ponds utilizing presently
      contemplated solutes.<br>
      <br>
      Although the present invention has been described with reference
      to a particular embodiment thereof, it should be understood that
      those skilled in the art may make many other modifications and
      embodiments thereof which will fall within the spirit and scope of
      the principles of this invention.<br>
