      <p><b><i><br>
            Popular Science</i> ( January 1929 )</b> </p>
      <p>Seeing at night or in the dark is aided by the device invented
        by David Gordon of Bridgeport, Conn. Looking into the instrument
        with one eye, the observer sees a spot of light that is
        controlled as to size and intensity. This gives the appearance
        to the other eye that the light is projected or flashed on the
        scene observed. As shown in the drawing, the sky becomes lighter
        while the objects, which are originally darker in color, remain
        black. The instrument is regulated by a rheostat controlled by
        batteries, and contains a bulb that gives off light to a ground
        glass and a hole in a film. </p>

        <p><b><font size="+1">US Patent # 2,374,991</font></b> </p>
        <p><b><font size="+1">Device for Aiding Night Vision</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>The present invention relates to a device for aiding night
        vision, and particularly an optical device for observing night
        or darkened scenes without the aid of a flashlight or other
        artificial source of illumination projected on such scenes. It
        is proposed to provide a device of this character adapted to be
        placed in front of one eye of the observer, to produce within
        its line of vision a spot of light controlled as to size and
        intensity, for the purpose to thereby increasing the perceptive
        ability of the other eye which views the scene directly. </p>
      <p>A further object is to provide such a device which may be
        conveniently used either with the naked eye, or in conjunction
        with an auxiliary seeing aid, the latter being for instance, a
        telescope, a periscope, a gun sight, dark glasses, and the like,
        depending upon the particular circumstances and type of scene
        being viewed. The device will find use in marine, air,
        underwater, and land observation, as well as in darkened
        interiors. In addition to its night use it may find use in
        giving an increased brightness to the appearance of scenes in
        the day time, and also for aiding the vision of people having
        impaired eyesight. </p>
      <p>With the above and other objects in view, embodiments of the
        invention are shown above in the accompanying drawing, and these
        embodiments will be hereinafter more fully described with
        reference thereto, and the invention will be finally pointed out
        in the claim. </p>

        vision. </p>

      <p>Similar reference characters indicate corresponding parts
        throughout the several figures of the drawing. </p>
      <p>Referring to the drawing, and in particular to Fig 1 which
        illustrated the general principle of the invention, the left eye
        1 of the observer is shown as directly viewing the night scene
        3, while the right eye 2 of the observer has the device of the
        invention interposed in its line of vision. This device consists
        of a lens 6 which brings into focus an iris diaphragm 4, the
        opening 9 of which is increased or diminished by operation of a
        handle 25. The diaphragm 4 is suitably placed intermediately the
        ends of a casing 19, the lens 6 being provided at one end of a
        casing while the other end constitutes an opaque closure, within
        which a light bulb 5 is interposed in the line of vision through
        the opening 9. A ground glass 8 is provided between the aperture
        9 and the light bulb 5 so that when the light bulb is lighted a
        diffused spot of light is seen through the opening 9, the size
        of this spot of light being controlled by varying the size of
        the opening. A screen 22 may be interposed between the aperture
        and the ground glass, and as shown in Fig 11, may have measuring
        calibration 23 provided thereon for the purpose of calculating
        distance in a manner similar to a range finder. </p>
      <p>The light bulb 5 is energized by suitable batteries provided in
        a battery case 11, and may be controlled as to its intensity by
        a rheostat 12. It has been found that a suitable light bulb 5 is
        a 2.7 type bulb energized by two 3-volt batteries and controlled
        by a rheostat of 30 ohms resistance. As shown in Fig 7, the
        rheostat may be provided with a knob 13, which may be turned to
        give the desired dimming and brightening of the spot of light as
        exposed through the aperture 9. By turning quickly back and
        forth the spot of light may be driven the effect of a series of
        light impulses. The circuit of the light bulb is opened and
        closed by means of a switch 14. The form of the device, as shown
        in Fig 7, s provided with a handle 18 for conveniently holding
        it, as shown for instance Fig. 13. </p>
      <p>In Fig 2 there is shown a slide member 17 having a series of
        apertures 9 of gradually increasing size, this member adapted to
        be used as an alternative for the iris diaphragm 4, for varying
        the size of the light spot. </p>
      <p>In Fig 3, there is shown a segment member 15 having a series of
        apertures 9 of gradually increasing size, and adapted to be
        rotated or swung by a handle 18, this member also adapted to be
        used as an alternative for varying the size of the light spot. </p>
      <p>As shown in Fig 4 and Fig 7, an opaque shutter 7 may be
        incorporated in the device in a position to be moved into
        relation with the aperture 9 to open and close it, this movement
        being accomplished through a handle 18. This shutter 7 has a
        circular periphery 28, and in operation may be rotated or swung
        over the aperture 9 for the purpose of giving a series of flash
        effects, as well as for the purpose of cutting down the light of
        the aperture. </p>
      <p>In Fig 8 the device of the invention is shown in conjunction
        with a periscope 26, the device being interposed in the line of
        vision of the right eye 2, while the periscope is interposed in
        the line of vision with the left eye 1. </p>
      <p>In Fig 9 the device s shown as connected by a support 24 to a
        telescope 20, the device being in the line of vision of the
        right eye 2, while the telescope is interposed in the line of
        vision of the left eye 1. </p>
      <p>In Fig 10, the device is shown as used in connection with a gun
        21 having the usual un sights, the device being shown in the
        line of vision of the right eye 2, while the gun sights vision
        of the right eye 2, while the gun sights are shown in the line
        of vision of the left eye 1. </p>
      <p>Fig 12 shows the device in connection with a pair of dark
        glasses 27, its use in this manner being especially for
        observing objects against the glare of the sun, as for instance,
        airplanes n the sky during the day time. These glasses may, if
        desired, be of various colors for giving novel effects to
        particular scenes. </p>
      <p>While I have described my invention it will be understand that
        the various parts of the invention may be changed without
        departing from the spirit thereof, and hence I do not limit
        myself to the present construction set forth, but consider
        myself at liberty to make changes within the scope of the
        invention. </p>
