      <br>
      Scottish scientists have made cancer tumours vanish within 10 days
      by sending DNA to seek and destroy the cells.<br>
      <br>
      The system, developed at Strathclyde and Glasgow universities, is
      being hailed as a breakthrough because it appears to eradicate
      tumours without causing harmful side-effects. A leading medical
      journal has described the results so far as remarkable, while
      Cancer Research UK said they were encouraging.<br>
      <br>
      Dr Christine Dufes, a lecturer at the Strathclyde Institute of
      Pharmacy and Biomedical Sciences and leader of the research, said:
      “The tumours were completely gone within 10 days. It is fantastic.
      When you talk about 10 days that is the time frame for curing a
      cold. Imagine if within 10 days you could completely make a tumour
      disappear.”<br>
      <br>
      Researchers around the world are trying to find ways to use genes
      as a cancer treatment, but one problem is ensuring they attack the
      tumour without destroying healthy tissue.<br>
      <br>
      In laboratory experiments the Strathclyde research team used a
      plasma protein called<span style="font-weight: bold;"> transferrin</span>,
      which carries iron through the blood, to deliver the therapeutic
      DNA to the right spot. Once in situ the DNA produced a protein
      that attacked the tumour cells.<br>
      <br>
      The findings have been published in the <span style="font-weight:
        bold; font-style: italic;">Journal of Controlled Release</span>,
      with an accompanying comment from editor Professor Kinam Park, of
      Purdue University, Indiana, saying other attempts to target genes
      at cancer cells have “seldom shown complete disappearance of
      tumours”.<br>
      <br>
      The research was initially supported with a grant from charity
      Tenovus Scotland, which supports the work of young scientists to
      help their ideas get off the ground.<br>

        polyamine polymers and dendrimeric polymers</span>, are shown to
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">possess anti-proliferative

      disorders characterised by undesirable cellular proliferation such
      as neoplasms and tumours, inflammatory disorders (including

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0002] Despite the number of deaths from cancer in 2000 being
      lower than estimated in 1985 cancer remains a leading cause of
      death in Europe [1]. In addition to the suffering and distress for
      patients and their families, the treatment of cancer clearly poses
      an enormous public health problem with wide ranging socioeconomic
      implications.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] Currently therapeutic options are limited and only 4% of
      patients requiring systemic treatment can be cured. The idea of a
      drug as the magic bullet, originally suggested at the end of the
      19th century by Nobel Laureate Paul Ehrlich, has since provided
      the paradigm for drug targeting. Pharmacologists have striven to
      develop so-called 'clean' drugs that avoid the sometimes dramatic
      and even life-threatening side effects of anticancer therapy often
      synonymous with 'chemotherapy' in the public's mind. A good
      example of this is alopecia induced by chemotherapy. This is an
      obvious side-effect with significant associated psychosocial
      morbidity; directing the drug away from the hair follicle would
      thus represent a significant therapeutic improvement. Over the
      years, improved administration modalities and novel cytotoxic
      drugs have led to significant improvements in the management of
      cancer [1, 2]. However, the need for safe and efficacious drugs to
      treat various forms of cancer remains high.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Cationic polyamine polymers (CPPs) have previously been
      used in various ways in biomedical research and pharmaceutical
      products, mainly as excipients in pharmaceutical formulations, but
      also to assist in delivery of drug molecules, gene delivery
      vectors, or other biomedical materials.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Naturally occurring polyamines (putrescine, spermidine, and
      spermine) play multifunctional roles in cell growth and
      differentiation but recently have also been implicated in
      promoting apoptosis [3]. Analogues of these natural polyamines
      have been developed as potential anti-cancer agents. These
      analogues include N1,N11-diethylnorspermine [4]. Various
      conformationally restricted and/or unsaturated synthetic
      polyamines, including analogues of 1N,12N-bisethylspermine,
      &lt;1&gt; N,&lt;14&gt; N-Bisethylhomospermine (BE-4-4-4), and
      3,8,13,18,23-pentaazapentacosane (BE-4-4-4-4), have also been
      investigated for anti-cancer activity [5, 6, 7, 8, 9].<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Frydman and colleagues report activity of the polyamine
      analogue SL-11093
      (3,8,13,18-tetraaza-10,11-[(E)-1,2-cyclopropyl]eicosane
      tetrahydrochloride) against xenografts in mouse models [10]. A
      series of cyclopropane containing analogues have been shown to be
      active in xenograft models [11,12].<br>
      <br>
      [0007] Liu and colleagues [13] review the effect of heparin-like
      glycosaminoglycans in tumour biology and report that these
      molecules can promote or inhibit tumour growth. Berry et al. [14]
      report that in cell culture the heparan sulfate-like
      glycosaminoglycans, and in particular heparin, were able to induce
      apoptosis of cancer cells when internalised. They also report that
      some members of a library of poly(beta-amino ester)s internalize
      heparin and thus inhibit tumour cell growth by up to 73% [14] but
      they do not show that these compounds behave any differently
      towards tumour cells and healthy cells, or demonstrate therapeutic
      applicability. Furthermore Ishida and colleagues report the
      effects of heparin sulphate glycosaminoglycans mimetic compounds
      may exert an anti-cancer effect, but suggest that this is due to
      increased adherence of the cells, rather than by uptake of the
      polymers [15].<br>
      <br>
      [0008] Dendrimer compounds have variously been used for delivery
      of a bioactive agent. Many of the biomedical and pharmaceutical
      application of dendrimers focus on PAMAM dendrimers [16-19], gene
      delivery [20-27] and phosphorous containing [28] compounds with a
      mixture of amine/amide or N-P(O2)S as the conjugating units
      respectively. Polypropylenimine dendrimers have also been studied
      as pH-sensitive controlled release systems for drug delivery [29,
      30] and for their encapsulation of guest molecules when chemically
      modified by peripheral amino acid groups [31]. Previous patent
      applications describing dendrimers (e.g. for as delivery agents)
      include U.S. Pat. No. 5,714,166, U.S. Pat. No. 5,990,089, U.S.
      Pat. No. 5,795,581 and WO03/001218.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] Kabanov and others report that polypropylenimine dendrimers
      interact with DNA via the surface primary amines only with no
      involvement of the internal amine groups [33] while Gebhart and
      Kabanov report very low gene transfer activity with the 5th
      generation polypropylenimine dendrimers DAB 64 in the
      easy-to-transfect COS cell line [34] and conclude that DAB 64 is
      far too toxic above a dendrimer-DNA weight ratio of 0.62:1
      (nitrogen to phosphate ratio of 4:1). Additionally Malik and
      others concluded that the cationic dendrimers as opposed to the
      anionic dendrimers are too toxic for parenteral use without
      further derivatisation with biocompatible groups such as
      polyethylene glycol units [35].<br>
      <br>
      [0010] The present inventors have recently demonstrated that the
      lower generation PPI dendrimers strike a favourable balance
      between their ability to transfect and their cytotoxicity [36, 37]
      and can also be used to deliver oligonucleotides into cells [38];
      see also WO03/033027.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] Duncan and colleagues describe the use of anionic PAMAM
      dendrimers coupled to a cytotoxic agent, such as a platinum
      containing compound (U.S. Pat. No. 6,585,956). Shaunak et al.
      describe an anionic (generation 3.5) PAMAM dendrimer conjugated to
      glucosamine and (separately) to glucosamine-6-sulfate, the
      glucosamine compounds having previously been reported to improve
      wound healing. The glucosamine and glucosamine-6-sulfate
      conjugates are reported to prevent scar tissue formation, but the
      non-conjugated dendrimer was found to have no biological activity
      of its own. The anionic, carboxyl-terminated, dendrimer was chosen
      because of its purported lack of toxicity compared to cationic
      amine-terminated PAMAM dendrimers [59]. Gong et al. report
      antiviral activities exhibited by a polyanionic lysine dendrimer,
      SPL-2999, in which the surface (terminal) groups are sodium salts
      of naphthyl 3,6-disulfonic acid [60].<br>
      <br>
      [0012] Polyethylenimine (PEI) polymers have been extensively used
      as gene delivery agents in vitro and in vivo [40]. Most of the PEI
      formulations studied to date have been prepared using branched PEI
      of varying molecular weight (0.6 kD-800 kD), but a linear PEI of
      22 kD has also been examined. Polyplexes from higher MW branched
      PEIs (70-800 kD) were found to be more efficient in vitro [40-43]
      but on intravenous administration the smaller and linear PEIs [44,
      45] seem in general to be more efficient than branched PEI of 25
      kD PEI [46, 47] or 50-750 kD PEI [48, 49]. More recently,
      cholesteryl PEI derivatives have also been shown to transfect
      cells [50, 51]. Targeted PEI based DNA complexes have been used to
      delivery genes to tumour xenografts [52], but the authors did not
      identify any specific antitumour activity provided by the polymer
      itself.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] Brownlie et al. describe a number of modifications of
      branched PEI but do not report any activity from the polymer
      itself [53].<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0014] The present inventors have found that certain cationic
      polymers have highly selective antiproliferative properties in
      vivo, which makes them particularly suitable for use as
      therapeutic agents for the treatment of diseases characterised by
      undesirable cellular proliferation. A number of these cationic
      polymers have previously been used to deliver agents such as
      nucleic acid into target cells, but their potential as therapeutic
      agents in their own right has, until now, been unrecognised.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] A first aspect of the present invention is the use of a
      compound of formula I or a salt thereof as an active agent in the
      preparation of a medicament for the treatment of a condition
      characterised by undesirable cellular proliferation:<br>

      [0027] A second aspect of the invention is the use of a dendrimer
      compound of the general formula III or a salt thereof as an active
      agent in the preparation of a medicament for the treatment of a

      T1 and T2 represent end groups bonded to the nth generation of the
      dendrimer, wherein T1 and T2 are independently selected from the

      [0034] While certain dendrimer compounds falling within Formula
      III have previously been used for delivery of therapeutic agents
      such as nucleic acids, they have not previouly been suggested for
      use as therapeutic agents in their own right. The compound of
      formula III, or salt thereof, may therefore be used in a
      composition (such as a pharmaceutical composition) as the sole
      active agent present. Thus, in some embodiments, the composition
      does not contain nucleic acid or other therapeutic agent which is
      active for the treatment of a condition characterized by
      undesirable cellular proliferation (e.g. a cytotoxic agent) in a
      therapeutically effective amount; for example, the composition may
      not contain nucleic acid or other therapeutic agent at all.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] In alternative embodiments, other active agents may be
      present, but need not be complexed with the dendrimer compound of
      formula III. Thus the compound of formula III or salt thereof is
      preferably not complexed to a nucleic acid molecule or other
      therapeutic agent which is active for the treatment of a condition
      characterized by undesirable cellular proliferation (e.g. a
      cytotoxic agent).<br>
      <br>
      [0036] Certain polymers having previously unrecognised
      antiproliferative properties may be used as delivery agents for
      other therapeutic agents such as cytotoxic drugs. A third aspect
      of the present invention is therefore a composition for delivering
      a bioactive molecule other than a nucleic acid to a target
      location in vivo, the composition comprising a compound of formula
      I or a salt thereof admixed with said bioactive molecule, wherein
      the composition does not contain nucleic acid:<br>

      [0048] Such compositions typically contain small complexes formed
      between the cationic polymer and the bioactive molecule. The
      complexes may take the form of small "nanoparticles". For optimal
      complex formation, the bioactive molecule is preferably anionic,
      and preferably carries more than one negative charge per molecule,
      in order that the cationic groups of the polymer are able to form
      non-covalent electrostatic interactions with the bioactive
      molecule.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] The compositions of this aspect of the invention may be
      particularly therapeutically effective because both the bioactive
      molecule and the polymer have therapeutic (e.g. antitumour)
      activity in their own right. Thus the compositions may provide an
      additive or even synergistic antiproliferative effect, in excess
      of the effect which would be obtained using the bioactive molecule
      alone.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] A further aspect of the present invention provides the use
      of a composition as described in relation to the third aspect of
      the invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative
      thereof, in the preparation of a medicament for the treatment of a
      condition characterised by undesirable cellular proliferation.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] Another aspect of the present invention provides a method
      of treating a condition characterised by undesirable cellular
      proliferation, which method comprises administering to a patient
      in need of treatment an effective amount of a compound of formula
      I or III, or a composition according to the third aspect of the
      invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative or salt
      thereof.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] Another aspect of the present invention provides novel
      compounds or salts, solvates and chemically protected forms
      thereof, and methods of synthesis thereof as described herein.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] Conditions which may be treated by the compounds and
      compositions described herein include conditions characterised by
      undesirable cellular proliferation, that is to say, conditions
      characterised by an unwanted or undesirable proliferation of
      normal or abnormal cells. Such conditions may involve neoplastic
      or hyperplastic growth of any type of cell, or inflammatory or
      autoimmune disorders in which proliferation of cells of the immune
      system gives rise to tissue damage or other symptoms of disease,
      which may be caused by direct cellular activity or by mediators
      released by the cells of the immune system.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] Examples of conditions characterised by undesirable
      cellular proliferation include, but are not limited to, benign,
      pre-malignant, and malignant cellular proliferation, including but
      not limited to, neoplasms and tumours (e.g., histocytoma, glioma,
      astrocytoma, osteoma), cancers (e.g., lung cancer, small cell lung
      cancer, gastrointestinal cancer, bowel cancer, colon cancer,
      breast carinoma, ovarian carcinoma, prostate cancer, testicular
      cancer, liver cancer, kidney cancer, bladder cancer, pancreas
      cancer, brain cancer, sarcoma, osteosarcoma, Kaposi's sarcoma,
      melanoma), leukemias, psoriasis, bone diseases, fibroproliferative
      disorders (e.g., of connective tissues), atherosclerosis and
      inflammatory disorders.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] Thus the compounds and compositions described herein may be
      useful in the treatment of chronic autoimmune conditions and/or
      inflammation (including, for example, rheumatoid arthritis); in
      the therapeutic and/or preventative treatment of localised
      lesions; for inhibiting angiogenesis (e.g. in the treatment of
      solid tumours); and in the treatment of wound healing (e.g. to
      reduce unwanted scar tissue formation, for example in relation to
      operations or burn injuries). Thus, the compounds and compositions
      described herein may be useful for preventing or reducing scar
      tissue formation during angioplasties (and may therefore be
      suitable for drug-coating stents for use in such procedures). The
      compounds and compositions described herein may also be useful for
      preventing the formation of unwanted tissue and vascularisation in
      the eye, e.g. in the cornea.<br>

      <br>
      [0183] The polymeric compounds of formulae I, III and IV described
      herein generally contain nitrogen atoms at various positions
      therein, including within terminal amino groups, e.g. R-NH2; and
      within internal groups such as groups interrupting an alkyl or
      alkylene group within the polymer structure, e.g. R-N(H)-R'; and
      at the intersection of a polymer branch, e.g. R-N(-R')-R'',
      wherein R, R' and R'' may be alkylene groups as defined herein,
      for example.<br>
      <br>
      [0184] In each case, reference to such a nitrogen atom, or to an
      amine or amino group containing such a nitrogen atom, includes the
      cationic derivative thereof. This includes derivatisation by
      protonation, e.g. by conversion of -NH2, -NH-, or -N&lt; to
      -N&lt;+&gt; H3, -N&lt;+&gt; H2- or -N&lt;+&gt; H&lt; respectively;

      -N&lt;+&gt; RH2, -N&lt;+&gt; RH-, &gt;N&lt;+&gt; R- respectively,
      wherein R is an alkyl group as defined herein: preferably R is a
      methyl group. Thus, reference to such a nitrogen atom or amino or
      amine group includes the quaternary cationic derivative thereof.
      Thus, the compounds defined herein for use in the present
      invention include quaternary cationic derivatives thereof, which
      may include groups such as the terminal group -N&lt;+&gt;

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Isomers, Salts, Solvates and
        Protected Forms</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0185] Certain compounds may exist in one or more particular
      geometric, optical, enantiomeric, diasteriomeric, epimeric,
      stereoisomeric, tautomeric, conformational, or anomeric forms,
      including but not limited to, cis- and trans-forms; E- and
      Z-forms; c-, t-, and r-forms; endo- and exo-forms; R-, S-, and
      meso-forms; D- and L-forms; d- and l-forms; (+) and (-) forms;
      keto-, enol-, and enolate-forms; syn- and anti-forms; synclinal-
      and anticlinal-forms; [alpha]- and [beta]-forms; axial and
      equatorial forms; boat-, chair-, twist-, envelope-, and
      halfchair-forms; and combinations thereof, hereinafter
      collectively referred to as "isomers" (or "isomeric forms").<br>
      <br>
      [0186] Note that, except as discussed below for tautomeric forms,
      specifically excluded from the term "isomers," as used herein, are
      structural (or constitutional) isomers (i.e., isomers which differ
      in the connections between atoms rather than merely by the
      position of atoms in space). For example, a reference to a methoxy
      group, -OCH3, is not to be construed as a reference to its
      structural isomer, a hydroxymethyl group, -CH2OH. Similarly, a
      reference to ortho-chlorophenyl is not to be construed as a
      reference to its structural isomer, meta-chlorophenyl. However, a
      reference to a class of structures may well include structurally
      isomeric forms falling within that class (e.g., C1-7 alkyl
      includes n-propyl and iso-propyl; butyl includes n-, iso-, sec-,
      and tert-butyl; methoxyphenyl includes ortho-, meta-, and
      para-methoxyphenyl).<br>
      <br>
      [0187] The above exclusion does not pertain to tautomeric forms,
      for example, keto-, enol-, and enolate-forms, as in, for example,
      the following tautomeric pairs: keto/enol (illustrated below),
      imine/enamine, amide/imino alcohol, amidine/amidine,
      nitroso/oxime, thioketone/enethiol, N-nitroso/hyroxyazo, and
      nitro/aci-nitro.<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      EMI8.0<br>
      <br>
      [0188] Note that specifically included in the term "isomer" are
      compounds with one or more isotopic substitutions. For example, H
      may be in any isotopic form, including &lt;1&gt; H, &lt;2&gt; H
      (D), and &lt;3&gt; H (T); C may be in any isotopic form, including
      &lt;12&gt; C, &lt;13&gt; C, and &lt;14&gt; C; O may be in any
      isotopic form, including &lt;16&gt; O and &lt;18&gt; O; and the
      like.<br>
      <br>
      [0189] Unless otherwise specified, a reference to a particular
      compound includes all such isomeric forms, including (wholly or
      partially) racemic and other mixtures thereof. Methods for the
      preparation (e.g., asymmetric synthesis) and separation (e.g.,
      fractional crystallisation and chromatographic means) of such
      isomeric forms are either known in the art or are readily obtained
      by adapting the methods taught herein, or known methods, in a
      known manner.<br>
      <br>
      [0190] Unless otherwise specified, a reference to a particular
      compound also includes ionic, salt, solvate, and protected forms
      of thereof, for example, as discussed below.<br>
      <br>
      [0191] It may be convenient or desirable to prepare, purify,
      and/or handle a corresponding salt of the active compound, for
      example, a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt. Examples of
      pharmaceutically acceptable salts are discussed in Berge et al.,
      1977, "Pharmaceutically Acceptable Salts," J. Pharm. Sci., Vol.
      66, pp. 1-19.<br>
      <br>
      [0192] For example, if the compound is anionic, or has a
      functional group which may be anionic (e.g., -COOH may be
      -COO&lt;-&gt; ), then a salt may be formed with a suitable cation.
      Examples of suitable inorganic cations include, but are not
      limited to, alkali metal ions such as Na&lt;+&gt; and K&lt;+&gt; ,
      alkaline earth cations such as Ca&lt;2+&gt; and Mg&lt;2+&gt; , and
      other cations such as Al&lt;+3&gt; . Examples of suitable organic
      cations include, but are not limited to, ammonium ion (i.e.,
      NH4&lt;+&gt; ) and substituted ammonium ions (e.g., NH3R&lt;+&gt;
      , NH2R2&lt;+&gt; , NHR3&lt;+&gt; , NR4&lt;+&gt; ). Examples of
      some suitable substituted ammonium ions are those derived from:
      ethylamine, diethylamine, dicyclohexylamine, triethylamine,
      butylamine, ethylenediamine, ethanolamine, diethanolamine,
      piperazine, benzylamine, phenylbenzylamine, choline, meglumine,
      and tromethamine, as well as amino acids, such as lysine and
      arginine. An example of a common quaternary ammonium ion is
      N(CH3)4&lt;+&gt; .<br>
      <br>
      [0193] If the compound is cationic, or has a functional group
      which may be cationic (e.g., -NH2 may be -NH3&lt;+&gt; ), then a
      salt may be formed with a suitable anion. Examples of suitable
      inorganic anions include, but are not limited to, those derived
      from the following inorganic acids: hydrochloric, hydrobromic,
      hydroiodic, sulfuric, sulfurous, nitric, nitrous, phosphoric, and
      phosphorous.<br>
      <br>
      [0194] Examples of suitable organic anions include, but are not
      limited to, those derived from the following organic acids:
      2-acetyoxybenzoic, acetic, ascorbic, aspartic, benzoic,
      camphorsulfonic, cinnamic, citric, edetic, ethanedisulfonic,
      ethanesulfonic, fumaric, glucoheptonic, gluconic, glutamic,
      glycolic, hydroxymaleic, hydroxynaphthalene carboxylic,
      isethionic, lactic, lactobionic, lauric, maleic, malic,
      methanesulfonic, mucic, oleic, oxalic, palmitic, pamoic,
      pantothenic, phenylacetic, phenylsulfonic, propionic, pyruvic,
      salicylic, stearic, succinic, sulfanilic, tartaric,
      toluenesulfonic, and valeric. Examples of suitable polymeric
      organic anions include, but are not limited to, those derived from
      the following polymeric acids: tannic acid, carboxymethyl
      cellulose.<br>
      <br>
      [0195] It may be convenient or desirable to prepare, purify,
      and/or handle a corresponding solvate of the active compound. The
      term "solvate" is used herein in the conventional sense to refer
      to a complex of solute (e.g., active compound, salt of active
      compound) and solvent. If the solvent is water, the solvate may be
      conveniently referred to as a hydrate, for example, a
      mono-hydrate, a di-hydrate, a tri-hydrate, etc.<br>
      <br>
      [0196] It may be convenient or desirable to prepare, purify,
      and/or handle the active compound in a chemically protected form.
      The term "chemically protected form" is used herein in the
      conventional chemical sense and pertains to a compound in which
      one or more reactive functional groups are protected from
      undesirable chemical reactions under specified conditions (e.g.,
      pH, temperature, radiation, solvent, and the like). In practice,
      well known chemical methods are employed to reversibly render
      unreactive a functional group, which otherwise would be reactive,
      under specified conditions. In a chemically protected form, one or
      more reactive functional groups are in the form of a protected or
      protecting group (also known as a masked or masking group or a
      blocked or blocking group). By protecting a reactive functional
      group, reactions involving other unprotected reactive functional
      groups can be performed, without affecting the protected group;
      the protecting group may be removed, usually in a subsequent step,
      without substantially affecting the remainder of the molecule.
      See, for example, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis (T. Green
      and P. Wuts; 3rd Edition; John Wiley and Sons, 1999).<br>
      <br>
      [0197] A wide variety of such "protecting", "blocking", or
      "masking" methods are widely used and well known in organic
      synthesis. For example, a compound which has two nonequivalent
      reactive functional groups, both of which would be reactive under
      specified conditions, may be derivatized to render one of the
      functional groups "protected," and therefore unreactive, under the
      specified conditions; so protected, the compound may be used as a
      reactant which has effectively only one reactive functional group.
      After the desired reaction (involving the other functional group)
      is complete, the protected group may be "deprotected" to return it
      to its original functionality.<br>
      <br>
      [0198] For example, a hydroxy group may be protected as an ether
      (-OR) or an ester (-OC(-O)R), for example, as: a t-butyl ether; a
      benzyl, benzhydryl (diphenylmethyl), or trityl
      (triphenylmethyl)ether; a trimethylsilyl or t-butyldimethylsilyl
      ether; or an acetyl ester (-OC(-O)CH3, -OAc).<br>
      <br>
      [0199] For example, an aldehyde or ketone group may be protected
      as an acetal (R-CH(OR)2) or ketal (R2C(OR)2), respectively, in
      which the carbonyl group (&gt;C-O) is converted to a diether
      (&gt;C(OR)2), by reaction with, for example, a primary alcohol.
      The aldehyde or ketone group is readily regenerated by hydrolysis
      using a large excess of water in the presence of acid.<br>
      <br>
      [0200] For example, an amine group may be protected, for example,
      as an amide (-NRCO-R) or a urethane (-NRCO-OR), for example, as: a
      methyl amide (-NHCO-CH3); a benzyloxy amide (-NHCO-OCH2C6H5,
      -NH-Cbz); as a t-butoxy amide (-NHCO-OC(CH3)3, -NH-Boc); a
      2-biphenyl-2-propoxy amide (-NHCO-OC(CH3)2C6H4C6H5, -NH-Bpoc), as
      a 9-fluorenylmethoxy amide (-NH-Fmoc), as a 6-nitroveratryloxy
      amide (-NH-Nvoc), as a 2-trimethylsilylethyloxy amide (-NH-Teoc),
      as a 2,2,2-trichloroethyloxy amide (-NH-Troc), as an allyloxy
      amide (-NH-Alloc), as a 2(-phenylsulfonyl)ethyloxy amide
      (-NH-Psec); or, in suitable cases (e.g., cyclic amines), as a
      nitroxide radical (&gt;N-O.).<br>
      <br>
      [0201] For example, a carboxylic acid group may be protected as an
      ester for example, as: an C1-7 alkyl ester (e.g., a methyl ester;
      a t-butyl ester); a C1-7 haloalkyl ester (e.g., a C1-7trihaloalkyl
      ester); a triC1-7 alkylsilyl-C1-7 alkyl ester; or a C5-7 aryl-C1-7
      alkyl ester (e.g., a benzyl ester; a nitrobenzyl ester); or as an
      amide, for example, as a methyl amide.<br>
      <br>
      [0202] For example, a thiol group may be protected as a thioether
      (-SR), for example, as: a benzyl thioether; an acetamidomethyl
      ether (-S-CH2NHC(-O)CH3).<br>
      <br>
      [0203] The term "treatment," as used herein in the context of
      treating a condition, pertains generally to treatment and therapy,
      whether of a human or an animal (e.g., in veterinary
      applications), in which some desired therapeutic effect is
      achieved, for example, the inhibition of the progress of the
      condition, and includes a reduction in the rate of progress, a
      halt in the rate of progress, amelioration of the condition, and
      cure of the condition. Treatment as a prophylactic measure (i.e.,
      prophylaxis) is also included.<br>
      <br>
      [0204] The term "therapeutically-effective amount," as used
      herein, pertains to that amount of an active compound, or a
      material, composition or dosage from comprising an active
      compound, which is effective for producing some desired
      therapeutic effect, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk
      ratio, when administered in accordance with a desired treatment
      regimen. Suitable dose ranges will typically be in the range of
      from 0.01 to 20 mg/kg/day, preferably from 0.1 to 10 mg/kg/day.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">[0000] Compositions and their
        Administration</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0205] Compositions (e.g. pharmaceutical compositions) may be
      formulated for any suitable route and means of administration.
      Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or diluents include those
      used in formulations suitable for oral, rectal, nasal, topical
      (including buccal and sublingual), vaginal or parenteral
      (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous, transdermal,
      intradermal, intrathecal and epidural) administration. The
      formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and
      may be prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of
      pharmacy. Such methods include the step of bringing into
      association the active ingredient with the carrier which
      constitutes one or more accessory ingredients. In general the
      formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing
      into association the active ingredient with liquid carriers or
      finely divided solid carriers or both, and then, if necessary,
      shaping the product.<br>
      <br>
      [0206] For solid compositions, conventional non-toxic solid
      carriers include, for example, pharmaceutical grades of mannitol,
      lactose, cellulose, cellulose derivatives, starch, magnesium
      stearate, sodium saccharin, talcum, glucose, sucrose, magnesium
      carbonate, and the like may be used. The active compound as
      defined above may be formulated as suppositories using, for
      example, polyalkylene glycols, acetylated triglycerides and the
      like, as the carrier. Liquid pharmaceutically administrable
      compositions can, for example, be prepared by dissolving,
      dispersing, etc, an active compound as defined above and optional
      pharmaceutical adjuvants in a carrier, such as, for example,
      water, saline aqueous dextrose, glycerol, ethanol, and the like,
      to thereby form a solution or suspension. If desired, the
      pharmaceutical composition to be administered may also contain
      minor amounts of non-toxic auxiliary substances such as wetting or
      emulsifying agents, pH buffering agents and the like, for example,
      sodium acetate, sorbitan monolaurate, triethanolamine sodium
      acetate, sorbitan monolaurate, triethanolamine oleate, etc. Actual
      methods of preparing such dosage forms are known, or will be
      apparent, to those skilled in this art; for example, see
      Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Company,
      Easton, Pa., 15th Edition, 1975. The composition or formulation to
      be administered will, in any event, contain a quantity of the
      active compound(s) in an amount effective to alleviate the
      symptoms of the subject being treated.<br>
      <br>
      [0207] Dosage forms or compositions containing active ingredient
      in the range of 0.25 to 95% with the balance made up from
      non-toxic carrier may be prepared.<br>
      <br>
      [0208] For oral administration, a pharmaceutically acceptable
      non-toxic composition is formed by the incorporation of any of the
      normally employed excipients, such as, for example, pharmaceutical
      grades of mannitol, lactose, cellulose, cellulose derivatives,
      sodium crosscarmellose, starch, magnesium stearate, sodium
      saccharin, talcum, glucose, sucrose, magnesium, carbonate, and the
      like. Such compositions take the form of solutions, suspensions,
      tablets, pills, capsules, powders, sustained release formulations
      and the like. Such compositions may contain 1%-95% active
      ingredient, more preferably 2-50%, most preferably 5-8%.<br>
      <br>
      [0209] Parenteral administration is generally characterized by
      injection, either subcutaneously, intramuscularly or
      intravenously. Injectables can be prepared in conventional forms,
      either as liquid solutions or suspensions, solid forms suitable
      for solution or suspension in liquid prior to injection, or as
      emulsions. Suitable excipients are, for example, water, saline,
      dextrose, glycerol, ethanol or the like. In addition, if desired,
      the pharmaceutical compositions to be administered may also
      contain minor amounts of non-toxic auxiliary substances such as
      wetting or emulsifying agents, pH buffering agents and the like,
      such as for example, sodium acetate, sorbitan monolaurate,
      triethanolamine oleate, triethanolamine sodium acetate, etc.<br>
      <br>
      [0210] The percentage of active compound contained in such
      parental compositions is highly dependent on the specific nature
      thereof, as well as the activity of the compound and the needs of
      the subject. However, percentages of active ingredient of 0.1% to
      10% in solution are employable, and will be higher if the
      composition is a solid which will be subsequently diluted to the
      above percentages. Preferably, the composition will comprise
      0.2-2% of the active agent in solution.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Polyethylenimine (PEI)</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0213] The compound of formula I of the first and third aspects of
      the invention may be a polyethylenimine compound.<br>
      <br>
      [0214] Polyethylenimine (PEI) is an aliphatic polyamine
      characterized by the repeating chemical unit denoted as
      -(CH2-CH2-NH)-.<br>
      <br>
      [0215] PEI may be branched or linear. Preferably, the PEI used in
      the present invention is linear PEI. However, the use of branched
      PEI is also envisaged.<br>
      <br>
      [0216] The amine groups of PEI exist in primary, secondary and
      tertiary form. In its branched form, primary, secondary and
      tertiary amine groups exist in the approximate ratio of 1:2:1 with
      a branching site every 3-3.5 nitrogen atoms along any given chain
      segment. The primary amine groups are chain-terminating units, and
      are the most basic and chemically reactive. Branched PEI is
      commercially available. For example, branched PEI having a
      molecular weight of 25 kDa is available from Aldrich, and is
      described in Cancer Gene Therapy (2002) 9, 673-680.<br>
      <br>
      [0217] However, PEI with fewer branching sites is also known, and
      linear PEI is described in J. Controlled Release 91 (2003)
      201-208, and in Cancer Gene Therapy (2002) 9, 673-680. Linear PEI
      having a molecular weight of 22 kD is commercially available from
      Helena Biosciences, UK, and St. Leon-Rot, Germany.<br>
      <br>
      [0218] PEI has a wide molecular weight range, for example, PEI
      molecular weights ranging from 300 daltons to 800 kD are known.<br>
      <br>
      [0219] Additionally, PEI is a cationic polymer, characterized by a
      high charge density at neutral pH (pH 7). For example, the
      cationic charge density of PEI may be in excess of 20 meq/g. Thus,
      PEI is positively charged at physiological pH (generally
      considered to be 7.4).<br>
      <br>
      [0220] As the molecular weight of PEI increases, the polymer
      structure is believed to assume a characteristic spherical
      configuration. This implies that there are charged nitrogen groups
      both on the surface and in the sterically protected interior of
      the molecule. PEIs are produced commercially as viscous liquids,
      both in the anhydrous and aqueous solution form. The viscosity of
      PEI is directly proportional to its concentration and molecular
      weight. PEIs are infinitely soluble in most polar materials
      including water, alcohols, glycols and certain organic solvents.
      Anhydrous PEIs will generate considerable heat upon aqueous
      dissolution due to an exothermic heat of dilution.<br>
      <br>
      [0221] The most prominent feature of PEI is its extremely high
      cationic charge density. The repeating monomer unit contains one
      protonatable nitrogen atom for every unit weight of 42. By theory,
      supported in practice by titrimetric analytical measurements, PEI
      has the highest cationic charge density (20-25 milliequivalents
      per gram) of any known organic polymer. Since PEI does not
      normally contain an appreciable amount of quaternary groups, it
      achieves its cationicity through protonation of the amine groups
      from the surrounding medium. This leads to a correlation between
      pH and cationic charge density. However, adhesive strength is not
      often affected in non-protonated environments because hydrogen
      bonding and Van der Waal's forces also participate in the bonding
      mechanism.<br>
      <br>
      [0222] PEI may be derivatised to contain cationic quaternary
      ammonium groups. For example, the terminal amino groups of PEI may
      be converted to a quaternary form in which three alkyl groups as
      defined herein are covalently bound to the nitrogen atom of the
      terminal amino group. Preferably, substantially only the terminal
      (primary) amino groups are converted to the quaternary form.
      However, in other embodiments, conversion of amino groups other
      than the terminal amino groups, i.e. internal (secondary and
      tertiary) amino groups, to the corresponding quaternary forms is
      also envisaged.<br>

      <br>
      [0223] The compounds of formula III of the second aspect of the
      invention are dendrimer compounds.<br>
      <br>
      [0224] Dendrimer synthesis is a field of polymer chemistry defined
      by regular, highly branched monomers leading to a monodisperse,
      tree-like or generational structure.<br>
      <br>
      [0225] Synthesizing monodisperse polymers demands a high level of
      synthetic control which is achieved through stepwise reactions,
      building the dendrimer up one monomer layer, or "generation," at a
      time. Thus, each dendrimer used in the present invention, consists
      of a multifunctional core molecule with a dendritic wedge attached
      to each functional site of the core. The functional sites of the
      core may be amino groups, for example. Preferably, each of the
      dendritic wedges is covalently bonded to a core functional atom of
      the functional site of the core. If the core functional sites are
      amino groups, then the core functional atoms are the nitrogen
      atoms of the amino groups, and each dendritic wedge is bonded to a
      nitrogen atom of the core. Similarly, if the core functional sites
      are phosphine groups, phosphate groups or other
      phosphorus-containing functional groups (e.g. derived from one of
      the phosphorus-containing substituents defined above), then the
      core functional atoms could be the phosphorus atoms of the
      phosphorus-containing groups, and each dendritic wedge would be
      bonded to a phosphorus atom of the core. Of course, cores
      containing other types of functional atoms may also be used in the
      dendrimers employed in the present invention, such as cores with
      C, S or O functional atoms, or wherein the functional atoms are
      other heteroatoms. The core molecule is referred to as "generation
      0." Each successive repeat unit along all branches forms the next
      generation, "generation 1," "generation 2," and so on until the
      nth terminating generation.<br>
      <br>
      [0226] There are two defined methods of dendrimer synthesis,
      divergent and convergent. In the divergent method the molecule is
      assembled from the core to the periphery; while in the convergent
      method, the dendrimer is synthesized beginning from the outside
      and terminating at the core. Generally, in either method the
      synthesis requires a stepwise process, attaching one generation to
      the last, purifying, and attaching the next generation.<br>

        Polypropylenimine (PPI) Dendrimers</span><br style="font-weight:
        bold;">
      <br>
      [0227] The compounds of formula III of the second aspect of the
      invention may be polypropylenimine (PPI) dendrimer compounds based
      on the polypropylenimine repeat unit -(CH2-CH2-CH2-N)&lt;, wherein
      the N atoms of the repeat units of a given generation are
      covalently bonded to two repeat units of the next generation, as
      follows:<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      EMI9.0<br>
      <br>
      [0228] Many commercially available PPI dendrimers are based on a
      1,4-diaminobutane core, and are thus referred to as "DAB"
      dendrimers. Such PPI DAB dendrimers are described in the published
      PCT application WO 03/033027, and in Pharmaceutical Research
      (2004) Vol. 21, No. 3, 458-466. Such dendrimers are commercially
      available from Aldrich (Poole, UK): see <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/img/assets/12141/Dendrimers_macro32-14.pdf</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0229] Such DAB dendrimers are referred to as DAB prefixed to the
      number of surface amine groups. Thus, DAB 4, is a generation 1
      dendrimer with four -CH2-CH2-CH2-NH2 units covalently bonded to
      the two nitrogen atoms of the 1,4-diaminobutane core, as follows:<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      EMI10.0<br>
      <br>
      [0230] Similarly, DAB 8 is a generation 2 dendrimer with eight
      -CH2-CH2-CH2-NH2 units covalently bonded to the four terminal
      nitrogen atoms of DAB 4, as follows:<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      EMI11.0<br>
      <br>
      [0231] Similarly, DAB 16 is a generation 3 dendrimer with sixteen
      -CH2-CH2-CH2-NH2 units covalently bonded to the eight terminal
      nitrogen atoms of DAB 8, as follows:<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      EMI12.0<br>
      <br>
      [0232] Similarly, DAB 32 is a generation 4 dendrimer with
      32-CH2-CH2-CH2-NH2 units covalently bonded to the sixteen terminal
      nitrogen atoms of DAB 16, and DAB 64 is a generation 5 dendrimer
      with 64-CH2-CH2-CH2-NH2 units covalently bonded to the 32 terminal
      nitrogen atoms of DAB 32.<br>
      <br>
      [0233] Polypropylenimine (PPI) dendrimers contain protonatable
      nitrogens in the form of amine groups (both surface primary amino
      groups and internal amine groups). Thus, the PPI dendrimers used
      in the present invention, such as the "DAB" dendrimers described
      above, are cationic, and have an overall cationic (positive)
      charge at neutral pH (pH 7). Thus, the PPI dendrimers used in the
      present invention are positively charged at physiological pHs of
      around 7 (e.g. 7.4). These dendrimers do not normally contain an
      appreciable amount of quaternary groups. Thus, they achieve their
      cationicity through protonation of the amine groups from the
      surrounding medium. This leads to a correlation between pH and
      cationic charge density.<br>
      <br>
      [0234] However, PPI dendrimers such as the commercially available
      DAB dendrimers DAB4, DAB8, DAB16, DAB32 and DAB64 may be
      quaternised (as described below, under "synthesis of quaternised
      DABs"). Thus, PPI dendrimers may be derivatised to contain
      cationic quaternary ammonium groups.<br>
      <br>
      [0235] It is preferable that the terminal amino groups (e.g.
      -NRR', where R and R' are independently H or alkyl as defined
      herein) of the PPI dendrimers are converted to a quaternary form
      in which three alkyl groups as defined herein are covalently bound
      to the nitrogen atom of the terminal amino group. Preferably,
      these alkyl groups are methyl groups. Preferably, substantially
      only the terminal amino groups are converted to the quaternary
      form. However, in other embodiments, conversion of non-terminal
      (internal) amino groups to the corresponding quaternary form is
      envisaged.<br>
      <br>
      [0236] DAB dendrimers, such as DAB4, DAB8, DAB16, DAB32 and DAB64
      may be quaternarised such that the terminal amino groups are
      converted to the quaternary form. An example is QDAB16, which is
      described in WO 03/033027 and has the following structure:<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      EMI13.0<br>
      <br>
      [0237] QDAB4, QDAB8, QDAB16, QDAB32 and QDAB64 have analogous
      structures. It is particularly preferred that DAB8 is used in the
      present invention in the quaternary form, thus QDAB8 is more
      preferable than DAB8. This is because quaternised DAB8 has a lower
      in vivo toxicity than non-quaternised DAB8.<br>
      <br>
      [0238] The synthesis and structure of DAB PPI dendrimers is
      further described in WO 03/033027.<br>

      [0239] The compounds of formula III of the second aspect of the
      invention may be PAMAM dendrimer compounds based on the amidoamine

      EMI15.0<br>
      <br>
      [0242] An example of a generation 1 PAMAM dendrimer is when eight
      -(CH2-CH2-C(-O)-N(H)-CH2-CH2-N)&lt; units are covalently bonded to
      the four terminal nitrogen atoms of the generation 0 dendrimer
      shown above. Similarly, a generation 2 PAMAM dendrimer with a core
      structure based on ethylenediamine is shown below, in which
      sixteen amidoamine units are bonded to the eight terminal nitrogen
      atoms of the generation 1 dendrimer described above:<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      EMI16.0<br>
      <br>
      [0243] PAMAM dendrimers having generation numbers in the range 0
      to 10 are commercially available from Sigma-Aldrich.<br>
      <br>
      [0244] PAMAM dendrimers may be based on a variety of different
      core molecules. These include diaminoalkane molecules such as
      ethylenediamine and 1,4-diaminobutane which both yield dendrimers
      with 4-fold core geometry. However, core molecules can also be (or
      be derived from) ammonia or tris(2-aminoethyl)amine (TAEA), which
      yield dendrimers with a 3-fold core geometry. The synthesis of
      PAMAM dendrimers based on a variety of different core geometries
      is described in Bioconjugate Chem. (1996) 7, 703-714.<br>
      <br>
      [0245] The PAMAM dendrimers used in the present invention are
      cationic, and have an overall cationic (positive) charge at
      neutral pH (pH 7). Thus, the PAMAM dendrimers used in the present
      invention are positively charged at physiological pH (e.g. 7.4).
      These dendrimers do not normally contain an appreciable amount of
      quaternary groups. Thus, they achieve their cationicity through
      protonation of the amine groups from the surrounding medium. This
      leads to a correlation between pH and cationic charge density.<br>
      <br>
      [0246] However, the terminal amino groups of the PAMAM dendrimers
      may be converted to a quaternary form in which three alkyl groups
      as defined herein are covalently bound to the nitrogen atom of
      each terminal amino group. Preferably, these alkyl groups are
      methyl groups. Preferably, substantially only the terminal amino
      groups are convered to the quaternary form. However, in other
      embodiments, conversion of non-terminal (internal) amino groups to
      the corresponding quaternary forms is envisaged.<br>
      <br>
      [0247] PAMAM dendrimers may be derivatised with surface groups
      such as optionally substituted C1-16 alkyl groups as defined
      herein, which are optionally interrupted with one or more
      heteroatoms or heterogroups, including other forms such as salts
      or derivatives thereof. Examples of such groups include
      amidoethylethanolamine, hexylamide, succinamic acid,
      Tris(hydroxymethyl)amidomethane, amidoethanol, amino and
      carboxylate (e.g. sodium carboxylate) groups. PAMAM dendrimers
      with these exemplified surface groups are available from
      Sigma-Aldrich.<br>
      <br>
      [0248] A further example of a PAMAM dendrimer compound for use in
      the present invention is SuperFect, which is an activated,
      spherical PAMAM dendrimer that possesses radiating branches with
      charged terminal amino groups, and is commercially available from
      Quiagen. See:

      [0251] Dendrimers for use in the present invention can be modified
      by covalently binding derivatising groups, such as hydrophobic or
      hydrophilic groups, or a combination of hydrophobic and
      hydrophilic substitutions to make the dendrimers amphiphilic. Such
      groups may be attached to the surface of a dendrimer.
      Additionally, two dendrimer molecules may be attached to either
      end of a hydrocarbon chain with a carbon length of 8, 12, 14, 16
      or 18 carbon atoms to give bolamphiphilic dendrimers. The number
      of derivatising groups may vary from one derivatising group per
      dendrimer molecule up to and including derivatising all available
      surface or terminal groups on the dendrimer molecule, for example,
      derivatising all 8 surface groups of the DAB8 molecule or all 16
      surface groups of the DAB16 molecule. An example of a preferred
      derivatising group is hyaluronic acid. Derivatising dendrimer
      molecules is described in WO 03/033027.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">General Synthesis Methods</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0252] Methods for the chemical synthesis of compounds for use in
      the present invention are described herein. These methods may be
      modified and/or adapted in known ways in order to facilitate the
      synthesis of additional compounds within the scope of the present
      invention. Descriptions of general laboratory methods and
      procedures, useful for the preparation of the compounds of the
      present invention, are described in Vogel's Textbook of Practical
      Organic Chemistry (5th edition, Ed. Furniss, B. S., Hannaford, A.
      J., Smith, P. W. G., Tatchell, A. R., Longmann, UK).<br>
      <br>
      [0253] In the methods described below, other substituent groups to
      those introduced may be present as precursors of those groups, or
      as protected versions of those groups.<br>
      <br>
      [0254] Dendrimer compounds of formula III can be prepared in a
      stepwise fashion from simple monomer units, the nature and
      functionality of which can be easily controlled and varied.
      Dendrimers are synthesised by the repeated addition of building
      blocks to a multifunctional core (divergent approach to synthesis)
      or towards a multifunctional core (convergent approach to
      synthesis), and each addition of a 3-dimensional shell of building
      blocks leads to the formation of a higher generation of the
      dendrimers. See Bosman, A. W. et al. (1999) "About dendrimers:
      structure, physical properties, and applications" Chem. Rev. 99,
      1665-1688.<br>
      <br>
      [0255] Polypropylenimine dendrimers may start from a diaminoalkane
      core (e.g. 1,4-diaminobutane) to which is added twice the number
      of amino groups by a Michael addition of acrylonitrile to the
      primary amines followed by the hydrogenation of the nitriles. This
      results in a doubling of the amino groups. See De Brabander-van
      den Berg, E. M. M. et al. (1993) "Poly(propylene imine)
      dendrimers: large scale synthesis by heterogeneously catalysed
      hydrogenations" Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 32, 1308-1311.<br>
      <br>
      [0256] The synthesis of PAMAM dendrimers involves the stepwise,
      exhaustive addition of two monomers, methacrylate and
      ethylenediamine. Two methacrylate monomers add to each
      bifunctional ethylenediamine, leading to increasingly branched
      structures with each cycle or generation. Scheme 1 below shows the
      stepwise addition of methacrylate and ethylenediamine to ammonia,
      tris-(2-aminoethyl)amine and ethylenediamine cores (each of which
      are examples of core molecules) to synthesis PAMAM dendrimers
      having three- and four-fold core geometries. The synthesis of
      dendrimers according to this principle is described in
      Bioconjugate Chem. (1996) 7, 703-714 and by Tomalia, D. A. et al.

      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Preferences</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0261] The following preferences may be combined with one another,
      and may be different for each aspect of the present invention.<br>
      [0262] Preferably, in formula III of the second aspect of the
      invention, the C1-16 alkyl and C1-16 alkylene groups are
      optionally substituted by one or more groups selected from oxo,
      amino, hydroxy, carboxy, alkoxy, ester and halo.<br>
      <br>
      [0263] Preferably, neither X nor X2 nor X3 of a given generation
      of the dendrimer is N(R&lt;2&gt; ) when Y of that generation is N.
      N(R&lt;2&gt; ) is as defined above in the second aspect of the
      invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0264] Preferably, when Y of a given generation of the dendrimer
      is C(R&lt;1&gt; ), X of that generation is selected from
      N(R&lt;2&gt; ) and optionally substituted C1-16 alkylene
      interrupted by one or more N(R&lt;2&gt; ) groups. Additionally or
      alternatively, when Y of a given generation of the dendrimer is
      C(R&lt;1&gt; ), both X2 and X3 of that generation are
      independently selected from N(R&lt;2&gt; ) and optionally
      substituted C1-16 alkylene interrupted by one or more N(R&lt;2&gt;
      ) groups.<br>
      <br>
      [0265] Preferably the generation number, n, of the dendrimer is in
      the range 1 to 10. More preferably, the generation number, n, is
      in the range 1 to 6.<br>
      <br>
      [0266] It is preferred that Y is N in one or more of the
      generations of the dendrimer. For example, if n is 4, is preferred
      that Y is N in at least one of the generations of the dendrimer.
      It is more preferred that Y is N in at least 2 of the generations
      of the dendrimer. It is even more preferred that Y is N in at
      least three of the generations of the dendrimer. It is most
      preferred that Y is N in all four of the generations of the
      dendrimer. This preference applies to other values of n: it is
      least preferred that Y is N in none of the generations, it is more
      preferred that Y is N in at least one of the generations, and
      so-on, until it is most preferred that Y is N in all of the
      generations.<br>
      <br>
      [0267] Thus, preferably, Y is N in at least 50% of the generations
      of the dendrimer: it is preferred that in most of the generations,
      the dendrimer branches at nitrogen atoms rather than carbon atoms.<br>
      <br>
      [0268] Additionally or alternatively, it may be that in at least
      50% of the generations of the dendrimer, X is selected
      independently for each of said generations of the dendrimer from
      N(R&lt;2&gt; ) and optionally substituted C1-16 alkylene
      interrupted by one or more N(R&lt;2&gt; ) groups. Thus, in this
      arrangement, most of the generations contain a nitrogen atom, even
      though Y may not be N in any, some or all of the generations.
      Additionally or alternatively, it may be that in at least 50% of
      the generations of the dendrimer, X2 and X3 are independently
      selected, independently for each of said generations of the
      dendrimer, from N(R&lt;2&gt; ) and optionally substituted C1-16
      alkylene interrupted by one or more N(R&lt;2&gt; ) groups. Again,
      in this arrangement, most of the generations contain a nitrogen
      atom, even though Y may not be N in any/some/all of the
      generations.<br>
      <br>
      [0269] Preferably, in at least 50% of the generations of the
      dendrimer, Y is N, X2 and X3are single bonds, and X is selected
      from optionally substituted C1-16 alkylene groups independently
      for each of said at least 50% of the generations of the dendrimer,
      wherein said C1-16 alkylene groups are independently optionally
      interrupted by one or more N(R&lt;2&gt; ) or O heterogroups.<br>
      <br>
      [0270] Preferably, T1 and T2 are independently selected from H,
      hydroxy, carboxy, halo and optionally substituted amino, amido,
      alkoxy, acyl, ester, C1-16 alkyl, C3-7 heterocyclyl, C5-10 aryl,
      C5-10 heteroaryl, C1-16 alkylene-NR&lt;3&gt; R&lt;4&gt; , C5-10
      arylene-NR&lt;3&gt; R&lt;4&gt; , C1-16 alkylene-C5-10
      arylene-NR&lt;3&gt; R&lt;4&gt; , and C5-10 arylene-C1-16
      alkylene-NR&lt;3&gt; R&lt;4&gt; , wherein R&lt;3 &gt; and R&lt;4
      &gt; are independently selected from H and optionally substituted
      C1-16 alkyl and C5-10 aryl, wherein said C1-16 alkyl and C1-16
      alkylene groups are optionally interrupted by one or more
      N(R&lt;2&gt; ) or O heterogroups. More preferably, T1 and T2 are
      independently selected from H, C1-16 alkyl and C1-16
      alkylene-NR&lt;3&gt; R&lt;4&gt; , wherein R&lt;3 &gt; and R&lt;4
      &gt; are independently selected from H and optionally substituted
      C1-16 alkyl, wherein said C1-16 alkyl and C1-16 alkylene groups
      are optionally interrupted by one or more N(R&lt;2&gt; ) or O
      heterogroups.<br>
      <br>
      [0271] Preferably Y of the nth generation is N, and X2 and X3 of
      the nth generation are single bonds, so that the dendrimer has
      terminal groups NT1T2. Here, the "nth generation" means the final
      generation of the dendrimer, to which the end groups T1 and T2 are
      bonded.<br>
      <br>
      [0272] Preferably, the dendrimer has an overall cationic charge
      (i.e. it is positively charged overall) at physiological pH (e.g.
      pH 7.4).<br>
      <br>
      [0273] Preferably this overall cationic charge arises as a result
      of the dendrimer containing nitrogen atoms at various positions
      therein, including within terminal amino groups, e.g. L-NH2 or
      L-NR'2 and/or within internal groups (denoted "internal
      nitrogen-containing groups") such as groups interrupting an alkyl
      or alkylene group within a linear part of the polymer structure,
      e.g. L-N(H)-L' or L-N(R')-L'; or at the intersection of a polymer
      branch, e.g. L-N(-L')-L'', wherein L, L' and L'' may be alkylene
      groups as defined herein, and R&lt;1 &gt; may be an alkyl group as
      defined herein, for example.<br>
      <br>
      [0274] The terminal amino groups and/or internal
      nitrogen-containing groups preferably have pKa's which cause them
      to be protonated, and therefore cationic, at physiological pH.
      Preferably, terminal amino groups and/or internal
      nitrogen-containing groups of the dendrimer have pKa's above 7,
      more preferably above 7.5, and most preferably in the range 8 to
      12.<br>
      <br>
      [0275] However, it may be that only terminal amino groups of the
      dendrimer (and not internal nitrogen-containing groups) have such
      preferable pKa values. Indeed, the pKa values of terminal amino
      groups would generally be expected to be within this preferred pKa
      range, and hence protonated and cationic at physiological pH. This
      is exemplified by the following pKa values (all in the range
      9-11), which correspond to the pKa's of the [alpha]-NH3&lt;+&gt;
      groups of the following amino acids (see Stryer, L.;
      "Biochemistry"; Third Edition; W.H. Freeman and Company, New York;
      page 42; ISBN 0-7167-1920-7): Alanine, 9.9; Glycine, 9.8;
      Phenylalanine, 9.1; Serine, 9.1; Valine, 9.6; Aspartic acid, 10.0;
      Glutamic acid, 9.7; Histidine, 9.2; Cysteine, 10.8; Tyrosine, 9.1;
      Lysine, 9.2; and Arginine, 9.0.<br>
      [0276] Thus, it is preferred that the terminal groups or "surface
      groups" of the dendrimer (that is, groups that are bonded to or
      part of the final, nth generation of the dendrimer, or that are
      bonded to or part of the T1 and T2 groups) are predominantly
      cationic at physiological pH. Preferably these groups have pKa's
      above 7, more preferably above 7.5, and most preferably in the
      range 8 to 12. Preferably, these terminal groups include amino
      groups, which are cationic at physiological pH.<br>
      <br>
      [0277] Preferably, the terminal groups of the dendrimer are not
      carboxyl groups, or do not comprise carboxyl groups, because
      carboxyl groups are generally anionic at physiological pH.
      Similarly, it is preferred that the terminal groups of the
      dendrimer do not comprise sulphonic acid groups, or naphthyl
      3,6-disulphonic acid groups, or salts thereof.<br>
      <br>
      [0278] Although dendrimer compounds having carboxyl, sulphonic
      acid, or naphthyl 3,6-disulphonic acid substituents are envisaged,
      it is preferable that the dendrimer retains a predominantly
      cationic charge (an overall positive charge) at physiological pH.
      Thus, it is preferred that the dendrimer compounds described
      herein are not predominantly anionic (that is, they should not be
      negatively charged overall) at physiological pH. They carry more
      positive charges than negative charges at physiological pH.<br>
      <br>
      [0279] Preferably, X2 and X3 are single bonds and Y is N so that
      the dendrimer compound is of the general formula IV:<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      EMI20.0<br>

      <br>
      m is an integer from 2 to 8;<br>
      X is selected from C1-16alkylene groups independently for each
      generation of the dendrimer;<br>
      wherein each of said C1-16 alkylene groups is optionally
      interrupted by one or more N(R&lt;2&gt; ) or O heterogroups and
      optionally substituted by one or more groups selected from oxo,
      amino, hydroxy, carboxy, alkoxy, ester and halo.<br>
      <br>
      [0283] Preferably, said functional atoms of the core are selected
      from nitrogen, phosphorus, oxygen, carbon or sulphur. More
      preferably each of said functional atoms of the core (to which the
      X groups of the first generation are bonded) is nitrogen.<br>
      <br>
      [0284] Preferably, D is a hydrocarbon, such as a saturated or
      unsaturated aliphatic or alicyclic hydrocarbon or an aromatic
      hydrocarbon, (or a combination of said different types of
      hydrocarbons bonded to each other) wherein the hydrocarbon is
      optionally substituted, and optionally interrupted by one or more
      heteroatoms. Preferably said hydrocarbon has from 1 to 16 carbon
      atoms. Preferably said hydrocarbon comprises one or more
      substituent groups, selected or derived from the substituent
      groups defined herein. Preferably, each substituent group
      comprises a core functional atom that is bonded to one or more X
      groups of the first generation of the dendrimer. Preferably each
      core functional atom is bonded to one or two X groups of the first
      generation of the dendrimer. Preferably, the number of substituent
      groups is 2, 3 or 4, each comprising a core functional atom bonded
      to one or more (preferably one or two) X groups of the first
      generation of the dendrimer. Additionally or alternatively, the
      hydrocarbon itself may comprise core functional atoms, e.g. carbon
      core functional atoms that are part of the hydrocarbon structure
      and additionally bonded to one or more (preferably one or two) X
      groups of the first generation of the dendrimer, or heteroatoms by
      which the hydrocarbon structure is interrupted and which are
      additionally bonded to one or more (preferably one or two) X
      groups of the first generation of the dendrimer.<br>
      <br>
      [0285] While it is preferable that D is an organic core molecule,
      as described above, inorganic core molecules are also envisaged.
      An example of an inorganic core is an alternating
      nitrogen-phosphorus heterocyclic ring structure, having phosphorus
      and/or nitrogen core functional atoms bonded to X groups of the
      first generation of the dendrimer.<br>
      <br>
      [0286] Preferably, D is selected from the following core
      structures, in which the core functional atom is nitrogen:<br>

      <br>
      [0000] wherein m is 4 and L is selected from C5-10 arylene, C1-15
      alkylene-C5-10 arylene, C1-15 alkylene-C5-10 arylene-C1-15
      alkylene-, or C5-10 arylene-C1-15 alkylene-C5-10 arylene.<br>
      <br>
      [0295] Alternatively, D is a substituted C5-10 aryl group, wherein
      the substituents comprise the core functional atoms (e.g. nitrogen
      atoms). For example, D may be<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      EMI30.0<br>
      <br>
      [0000] a trisubstituted phenyl ring, wherein m is 6 and the
      three-substituents are either bonded respectively to the 1, 2, and
      3 positions; the 1, 2 and 4 positions; or the 1, 3 and 5 positions
      of the phenyl ring. The phenyl ring may be optionally substituted
      at the other positions, with a substituent as defined herein.<br>
      <br>
      [0296] In the above D groups, each nitrogen atom is bonded to two
      X groups of the first generation: accordingly, m is twice the
      number of core functional nitrogen atoms in each case. However,
      other core structures are envisaged, similar to those listed
      above, but wherein one or more of the core functional nitrogen
      atoms are (each) only bonded to one X group of the first
      generation of the dendrimer, rather than two X groups.
      Accordingly, in these alternative D groups m is less than twice
      the number number of core functional nitrogen atoms. In these
      alternative D groups, the nitrogen atoms not bonded to two X
      groups may be bonded instead to one X group and one substituent as
      defined herein (e.g. H or alkyl).<br>
      <br>
      [0297] While nitrogen core functional atoms are preferred, cores
      having other functional atoms bonded to the X groups of the first
      generation of the dendrimer are also envisaged. These core
      functional atoms may be heteroatoms such as phosphorus, sulphur,
      and oxygen; or carbon, for example. A combination of different
      types of core functional atoms may be employed in a single core
      structure, although it is preferable that the core functional
      atoms within a given core structure are the same type (e.g. all
      nitrogen, or all phosphorus).<br>
      <br>
      [0298] A phosphorus core functional atom may be part of a
      phosphine, phosphine oxide or phosphate group (or another group
      derived from one of the phosphorus-containing functional groups
      defined herein) which is bonded to or part of the core structure.
      For example, core structures similar to those listed above are
      envisaged, in which the terminal nitrogen atoms (the core
      functional atoms) are replaced with trivalent phosphorus atoms
      (-P&lt;), or pentavalent phosphine oxide groups (-P(-O)&lt;).
      Phosphorus-containing core structures are known in the art, and
      may be employed in the present invention. See <br>
      <br>
      http://www.dendrichem.com/uk/17.htm for examples of
      phosphorus-containing core structures.<br>
      <br>
      [0299] Similarly, a carbon core functional atom may be part of a
      carbonyl group, for example (or part of another group derived from
      one of the carbon-containing functional groups defined herein,
      including alkyl and aryl groups) which group is bonded to or part
      of the core structure. For example, core structures D having one
      or more terminal carbonyl groups are envisaged, wherein the
      carbonyl carbon is covalently attached to (a) the core structure,
      and (b) an X group of the first generation of the dendrimer, as
      follows:<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      core-C(-O)-X<br>
      <br>
      [0300] Similarly, oxygen core functional atoms may be part of
      carboxylic acid, ether or ester groups of the core structure, or
      part of other groups derived from the oxygen-containing functional
      groups defined herein, which groups are bonded to or part of the
      core structure, wherein the oxygen core functional atom is
      covalently attached to an X group of the first generation of the
      dendrimer.<br>
      <br>
      [0301] Sulphur core functional atoms may be part of sulphur
      dioxide, -S(-O)2-, groups for example, or other groups derived
      from one of the sulphur-containing functional groups defined
      herein. The group is bonded to or part of the core structure, and
      core structures similar to those listed above, except having
      terminal sulfur-containing groups, are envisaged, the sulphur
      atoms being bonded to an X group of the first generation of the
      dendrimer.<br>
      <br>
      [0302] Preferably, X is either selected from unsubstituted,
      uninterrupted C1-16 alkylene groups (an example being a
      polyalkylenimine dendrimer such as a PPI dendrimer, or a DAB PPI
      dendrimer); or selected from C1-16 alkylene groups interrupted
      with an N(R&lt;2&gt; ) group and containing an oxo substituent (an
      example being a PAMAM dendrimer).<br>
      <br>
      [0303] X may be selected from groups having the general structure
      Cp alkylene-C(O)N(R&lt;2&gt; )-Cq alkylene wherein p and q are
      integers and p+q is in the range 2 to 16. In this case, X is
      preferably selected from groups having the general structure C1-6
      alkylene-C(O)NH-C1-6 alkylene.<br>
      <br>
      [0304] Alternatively, X may be selected from linear unsubstituted
      C1-16 alkylene groups. In this case, X is preferably selected from
      ethylene, propylene, butylene, pentylene and hexylene.<br>
      <br>
      [0305] Preferably, X is the same group in each and every
      generation of the dendrimer. However, alternative embodiments are
      envisaged wherein X differs between different generations of the
      dendrimer, so that X in a particular generation is different from
      X in a subsequent generation. However, X is generally the same
      throughout any one particular generation.<br>
      <br>
      [0306] Most preferably, X is either -(CH2)2-C(-O)N(H)-(CH2)2-
      (e.g. in a PAMAM dendrimer) or propylene (in a PPI dendrimer).<br>
      <br>
      [0307] Preferably T is H or C1-4 alkyl, so that the terminal
      groups of the dendrimer are NH2 or N(R&lt;4&gt; )2 wherein R&lt;4
      &gt; is C1-4 alkyl. Even more preferably, T is H or methyl, so
      that the terminal groups of the dendrimer are NH2 or NMe2.<br>
      <br>
      [0308] The nitrogen-containing groups of the compound of formula
      III may be in a cationic, quaternary form. Preferably
      substantially only terminal amino groups of the dendrimer are in a
      quaternary form. Preferably, the terminal amino groups in the
      quarternary form comprise three C1-4 alkyl groups covalently bound
      to the nitrogen atom of the terminal amino group. More preferably
      said C1-4 alkyl groups are methyl groups, so that the terminal
      groups are -N&lt;+&gt; Me3.<br>
      <br>
      [0309] The compound of formula III may be a polyamidoamine (PAMAM)
      dendrimer wherein n is in the range 1 to 6.<br>
      <br>
      [0310] T may be selected from amidoethylethanolamine, hexylamide,
      succinamic acid, Tris(hydroxymethyl)amidomethane, amidoethanol,
      amino and carboxylate groups.<br>
      <br>
      [0311] A preferred compound of formula III is SuperFect, which is
      available commercially from Qiagen.<br>
      <br>
      [0312] Alternatively, the compound of formula III may be a
      poly(propylenimine) dendrimer having a 1,4-diaminobutane core.<br>
      <br>
      [0313] Compounds for use in the second aspect of the invention
      include activated or fractured (e.g. heat fractured) derivatives
      of the dendrimer compounds of formula III or formula IV. These
      derivatives include <br>
      activated SuperFect or fractured SuperFect, which is commercially
      available from Quiagen.<br>
      <br>
      [0314] Preferably, T is either H or methyl.<br>
      <br>
      [0315] Preferably, when the compound of formula III is a
      poly(propylenimine) dendrimer wherein n is 2 (e.g. DAB8) T is
      methyl and the terminal amino groups are in the cationic
      quaternary form comprising three methyl groups covalently bound to
      the nitrogen atoms of said amino groups. It is particularly
      preferred that DAB8 is used in the present invention in the
      quaternary form, thus QDAB8 is more preferable than DAB8. This is
      because quaternised DAB8 has a lower general in vivo toxicity than
      non-quaternised DAB8.<br>
      <br>
      [0316] Preferably the compound of formula III or salt thereof is
      not complexed to a nucleic acid molecule.<br>

      associated with one or more glucosamine or glucosamine-6-sulphate
      molecules. Preferably, the compound of formula III or salt thereof
      is not conjugated, completed, coupled, bonded or non-covalently
      associated with one or more naphthyl 3,6-disulfonic acid groups.<br>
      <br>
      [0320] Preferably, in formula I of the first and third aspects of
      the invention, said C1-16 alkyl and C1-16 alkylene groups are
      optionally substituted by one or more groups selected from oxo,
      amino, hydroxy, carboxy, alkoxy, ester and halo.<br>
      <br>
      [0321] Preferably, A and A' are selected from unsubstituted C1-6
      alkylene groups. More preferably, A and A' are ethylene.<br>
      <br>
      [0322] Preferably, the B groups of the backbone monomer units are
      independently selected from H and a branching group of formula II.
      Similarly, the B' groups of the monomer units of the branching
      group are preferably independently selected from H and a branching
      group of formula II.<br>
      <br>
      [0323] R' and R'' may be selected from unsubstituted C1-6 alkyl
      groups. Preferably, R' and R'' are selected from H, methyl and
      ethyl.<br>
      <br>
      [0324] Preferably, R is selected from H and NR&lt;2&gt; R&lt;3
      &gt; wherein R&lt;2 &gt; and R&lt;3 &gt; are H or unsubstituted
      C1-6 alkyl groups. More preferably, R is selected from H, NH2,
      NMe2 and NEt2.<br>
      <br>
      [0325] Preferably, the compound of formula I has an overall
      cationic charge (i.e. it is positively charged overall) at
      physiological pH.<br>
      <br>
      [0326] This overall cationic charge arises as a result of the
      polymer containing nitrogen atoms at various positions therein,
      including within terminal amino groups, e.g. L-NH2 or L-NR'2
      and/or within internal groups (denoted "internal
      nitrogen-containing groups") such as groups interrupting an alkyl
      or alkylene group within a linear part of the polymer structure,
      e.g. L-N(H)-L' or L-N(R')-L'; or at the intersection of a polymer
      branch, e.g. L-N(-L')-L'', wherein L, L' and L'' may be alkylene
      groups as defined herein, and R' may be an alkyl group as defined
      herein, for example.<br>
      <br>
      [0327] The terminal amino groups and/or internal
      nitrogen-containing groups preferably have pKa's which cause them
      to be protonated, and therefore cationic, at physiological pH.
      Preferably, the terminal amino groups and/or internal
      nitrogen-containing groups of the compound of formula I have pKa's
      above 7, more preferably above 7.5, and most preferably in the
      range 8 to 12.<br>
      <br>
      [0328] However, it may be that only terminal amino groups of the
      polymer (and not internal nitrogen-containing groups) have such
      preferable pKa values. Indeed, the pKa values of terminal amino
      groups would generally be expected to be within the preferred pKa
      range, and hence protonated and cationic at physiological pH. This
      is exemplified by the pKa values listed above (all in the range
      9-11) of [alpha]-NH3&lt;+&gt; groups of amino acids.<br>
      <br>
      [0329] Thus, it is preferred that the terminal groups of the
      compound of formula I (i.e. groups that are situated at the ends
      of the polymer including at the ends of polymer branches, and
      substituents of such groups) are predominantly cationic at
      physiological pH. Preferably these groups have pKa's above 7, more
      preferably above 7.5, and most preferably in the range 8 to 12.
      Preferably, these terminal groups include amino groups.<br>

      [0330] The nitrogen-containing groups of the compound of formula I
      (including internal nitrogen-containing groups and terminal amino
      groups) may be in a cationic, quaternary form. However, it may be
      that substantially only the terminal amino groups of the compound
      of formula I are in a quaternary form.<br>
      <br>
      [0331] The terminal amino groups in the quarternary form may
      comprise three C1-6 alkyl groups covalently bound to the nitrogen
      atom of the terminal amino group. Preferably, said C1-6 alkyl
      groups are methyl groups.<br>
      <br>
      [0332] The compound of formula I may be a polyethylenimine
      compound.<br>
      <br>
      [0333] The compound of formula I may have a molecular weight in
      the range 0.6 kD to 800 kD, e.g. in the range 5 to 45 kD, or in
      the range 21 to 24 kD. In certain embodiments, for example when
      the compounds is linear polyethyleneimine, it may have a molecular
      weight of 22 kD.<br>
      <br>
      [0334] In the first aspect of the invention it is preferred that
      n, which denotes the number of backbone monomer units -[A-N(B)]-
      in the compound of formula I, is greater than or equal to 20. It
      is more preferred that n is greater than or equal to 25. It is
      even more preferred that n is greater than or equal to 30, 50, 75,
      100, 150 or 200, in order of increasing preference.<br>
      <br>
      [0335] In the first aspect of the invention, it is preferred that
      n, which denotes the number of backbone monomer units -[A-N(B)]-
      in in the compound of formula I, is less than or equal to 20000.
      It is more preferred that n is less than or equal to 10000. It is
      even more preferred that n is less than or equal to 5000, 1000,
      800 or 700, in order of increasing preference.<br>
      <br>
      [0336] Thus, in the first aspect of the invention there are
      preferred ranges for n, determined by any combination of the
      preferred maximum and minimum values for n outlined above.<br>
      <br>
      [0337] Preferably, in the first aspect of the invention, the

      <br>
      [0339] Preferably, in the first aspect of the invention, the
      compound of formula I or salt thereof is not complexed to an agent
      that is active for the treatment of a condition characterized by
      undesirable cellular proliferation.<br>
      <br>
      [0340] When used in the compositions of the third aspect of the
      invention, n, which denotes the number of backbone monomer units
      -[A-N(B)]- in the compound of formula I, is preferably less than
      or equal to 20000. It is more preferred that n is less than or

      50 or 30 in order of increasing preference.<br>
      <br>
      [0341] Thus, preferred ranges for n in the compound of formula I
      when used in the compositions of the third aspect of the invention
      are 3-20000; 3-10000; 3-5000; 3-1000; 3-700; 3-500; 3-300; 3-250;

      [0342] In the compounds of formula I it is preferred that the
      average value for m, which denotes the number of monomer units
      -[A'-N(B')]- in a branching group of formula II, is less than 0.5
      n, where n denotes the number of backbone monomer units -[A-N(B)]-
      in the compound of formula I. It is more preferred that the
      average value for m is less than 0.25 n. It is even more preferred
      that the average value for m is less that 0.1 n. It is most
      preferred that the average value for m is less than 0.01 n. This
      is because it is preferable that the compound of formula I is
      substantially linear. The "average value for m" means the mean
      number of repeat units m in a branching group, taking into account
      all the branching groups (of formula II) within the compound of
      formula I. It is preferred that m is only a small fraction of n,
      because the compound of formula I is preferably substantially
      linear.<br>
      <br>
      [0343] Preferably, the compound of formula I is substantially
      linear, wherein the branching groups of formula II are located on
      average, at every qth nitrogen atom along any given polymer chain
      segment, wherein q is greater than 3 or greater than 3.5. More
      preferably, q is greater than 10.<br>
      <br>
      [0344] In this case, substantially all (e.g. above 80%, preferably
      above 90%, more preferably above 95%, and most preferably above
      98%) of the B groups of the backbone monomer units may be H, and
      substantially all (e.g. above 80%, preferably above 90%, more
      preferably above 95%, and most preferably above 98%) of the B'
      groups of the branching group of formula II may be H.<br>
      <br>
      [0345] Preferably, the compound of formula I is not a dendrimer.<br>

      <br>
      [0346] The polymers and dendrimers for use in the present
      invention, including those of formulae I, III and IV described
      herein, may be associated with one or more molecules or ligands.
      This may be in order to improve the biodistribution,
      bioavailability, biocompatibility and/or physiochemistry of the
      polymer, for example. The term "associated with", as used herein,
      includes covalent conjugation, either directly or via a linker or
      tether molecule, as well as non-covalent association or
      complexation (e.g. by electrostatic or other non-covalent
      interaction).<br>
      <br>
      [0347] In particular, the polymers described herein may be
      associated with molecules or ligands that facilitate in vivo
      targeting of the polymer ("targeting moieties"). Thus, the
      polymers of the invention may be targeted to tumours by
      association (e.g. by covalent linkage, or electrostatic
      association) with a ligand capable of binding to a receptor (e.g.
      a protein) on the surface of a given tumour.<br>
      <br>
      [0348] Various strategies for targeting tumours in this way are
      known to those skilled in the art, as described by Cassidy, J. and
      A. G. Schatzlein (2004) "Tumour targeted drug and gene delivery:
      principles and concepts." Expert Reviews in Molecular Medicine in
      press, and by Schätzlein, A. G. (2003) "Targeting of synthetic
      gene delivery systems." Journal of Biomedicine and Biotechnology

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Hyaluronic Acid Conjugates</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0349] A preferred moiety for facilitating in vivo targeting of
      the polymeric compounds of the invention is hyaluronic acid (HA).
      The polymers of formulae I, III and IV described herein may be
      associated with hyaluronic acid (HA). HA is an anionic
      polysaccharide composed of repeating units of
      beta-1-4-glucuronate-beta-1-3-N-acetylglucosamine, as shown below:<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      EMI31.0<br>
      <br>
      [0350] Hyaluronic acid is the natural ligand of the CD44 receptor
      which is overexpressed in a number of tumours but has also been
      implicated as a marker for cancer stem cells [56]. Thus, HA is
      capable of selective binding to such tumours in which CD44 is
      overexpressed, and may be used to target the polymers in the
      present invention to the tumours.<br>
      <br>
      [0351] Preferably, the polymer compound of formulae I, III or IV
      is linked to HA through covalent conjugation of the polymer to the
      HA backbone. Preferably the polymer compound of formulae I, III or
      IV is linked to low molecular weight HA. Low molecular weight HA
      may be produced by acid hydrolysis or enzymatic cleavage (see
      below). Preferably, the covalent linkage between HA and the
      polymer is via an amide bond C(-O)-N(H). Preferably, the amide
      bond is formed through reaction of a terminal amino group of the
      polymer with a carboxyl group of HA. Preferably,
      1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDAC) is used as a
      coupling reagent to activate the carboxyl group of HA for coupling
      with a terminal primary amino group of the polymer, forming an
      amido linkage between HA and polymer.<br>
      <br>
      [0352] While an amido linkage between HA and the polymer is
      exemplified, other types of covalent linkages between HA and the
      polymers of the invention are envisaged. Various covalent linkages
      between polymer and HA may be created using standard coupling
      chemistry, as would be appreciated by the skilled person. For
      example, a carboxyl group of HA may be reacted with a different,
      suitable substituent group on the polymer (e.g. a substituent
      group selected from those defined hereinbefore, such as a hydroxyl
      group) to covalently link the two molecules. Alternatively, the
      carboxyl groups of HA may first be derivatised to form other
      reactive functional groups (e.g. acid amide or acid chloride
      groups) that may then be reacted with a suitable substituent (e.g.
      selected from those defined above) on the polymer.<br>
      <br>
      [0353] Although direct covalent coupling of HA to the polymers is
      an option, a tether or linker molecule may be used. The tether or
      linker may itself be a biocompatible polymer or oligomer such as
      poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), or a polyethylenimine polymer or
      oligomer, or another linker molecule such as an optionally
      substituted, optionally interrupted alkylene chain. The skilled
      person would be aware of suitable linker molecules. Again,
      standard coupling chemistry could be used to couple each end of
      the linker molecule to HA and a polymer of the invention
      respectively. Preferably the linker molecule is PEG.<br>
      <br>
      [0354] The polymers of the present invention may be derivatised by
      covalent attachment of PEG chains thereto, as exemplified in
      Brownlie, A., I. F. Uchegbu and A. G. Schatzlein (2004) "PEI-based
      vesicle-polymer hybrid gene delivery system with improved
      biocompatibility." Int J Pharm 274(1-2): 41-52, which describes
      the covalent coupling of PEG chains to branched polyethylenimine
      to form comb-type co-polymers. See also Luo et al., Macromolecules
      2002, 35, 3456-3462, which describes the synthesis of
      PEG-conjugated PAMAM dendrimer. Thus, one or more of these PEG
      chains may be used as a linker molecule for coupling the polymer
      to a targeting ligand such as HA. Indeed, the "free end" of a PEG
      chain in such a comb-type copolymer could be coupled (using
      standard coupling chemistry) to HA. Of course, reaction of the PEG
      terminus of a comb-type polymer with an HA molecule would be
      facilitated by the use of (hetero-) bifunctional PEG in forming
      the comb-type polymer, so that the PEG terminus was suitably
      functionalised (e.g. with a terminal amino group) for reaction
      with HA. Alternatively, the comb-type polymer itself could be
      further derivatised so that the PEG terminus comprised a
      functional group (such as an amino group) suitable for reaction
      with HA (e.g. in the presence of the coupling agent EDAC). Linkers
      have been used previously to target polyamino-polymers (see Brown,
      M. D., A. I. Gray, L. Tetley, A. Santovena, J. Rene, A. G.
      Schatzlein and I. F. Uchegbu (2003). "In vitro and in vivo gene
      transfer with poly(amino acid) vesicles." J Control Release 93(2):
      193-211).<br>
      <br>
      [0355] While covalent linkage of the polymers of formulae I, III
      and IV to HA is preferred, complexation through non-covalent (e.g.
      electrostatic) interactions is also envisaged.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Other Ligands</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0356] Association of the polymers described herein with ligands
      other than HA is also envisaged. For example, protein or
      carbohydrate ligand or another type of polymeric ligand may be
      associated with these polymers. As described above for HA, the
      linkage may be covalent, e.g. via a linker or tether molecule, or
      non-covalent, e.g. electrostatic. Thus, a protein ligand for, or
      antibody against, any receptor or other molecule expressed on the
      surface of a tumour cell (e.g. a tumour-specific antigen), may be
      associated with a polymer described herein, to facilitate
      targeting of that polymer to the tumour cells. A number of
      different types of ligands could be coupled to the polymer in this
      way (possibly in combination with each other, or in combination
      with HA-see below).<br>
      <br>
      [0357] The targeting moieties may be endogenous or exogenous,
      synthetic or naturally occurring. Naturally-occurring ligands
      which may be coupled to the polymers described herein include
      small molecules, such as biotin-avidin, and folate
      receptor/folate. Other peptides or proteins may be coupled to the
      polymers described herein, including phage-derived peptides,
      antibodies, antibody fragments, and endogenous peptides or
      proteins such as growth factors, hormones or any other molecule
      capable of binding specifically to a molecule expressed on the
      surface of the desired target cell type. Examples include EGF,
      transferrin, carbohydrates, lectins, polymeric molecules such as
      hyaluronic acid (HA), and antibodies and fragments thereof.
      Antibody fragments ideally retain antigen binding capability (e.g.
      Fab fragments) but may consist of or comprise constant regions of
      the molecule such as Fc domains, e.g. if the target cell carries
      Fc receptors.<br>
      <br>
      [0358] Coupling strategies and chemistries suitable for
      associating the above ligands with the polymers described herein
      (either covalently or non-covalently) are apparent to the skilled
      person: some of these are described above in relation to HA.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Combinations of Ligands</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0359] The polymers described herein may be associated with a
      plurality of different targeting moieties. Thus a polymer may be
      linked to a combination of the ligands or ligand types described
      above. This is useful for cross-sectional targeting of the
      polymers described herein. For example, if a first ligand binds a
      receptor on target tumour cells as well as a receptor on a first
      population of non-target cells, and if a second ligand binds a
      receptor on the same target cells as well as a receptor on another
      (second) population of non-target cells, then association of a
      polymer of the invention with both the first and second ligands
      can result in higher specificity of the polymer for the target
      tumour cells than for the each population of non-target cells.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Reversible Coupling of Ligands</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0360] The association (whether by covalent coupling or
      electrostatic attraction) of the ligands described above (e.g. HA)
      with the polymers described herein may be reversible, or
      cleavable. For example, a cleavable covalent linker (or
      alternatively a "% reversible" electrostatic attraction) may be
      employed, which reacts to environmental changes (e.g. pH, or
      hypoxia) to trigger release of the ligand from the polymer.<br>
      <br>
      [0361] This is especially important if the polymer of the
      invention is inactive when bound to a targeting moiety, such that
      rescue of the activity of the polymer is required once the polymer
      has been successfully delivered to the target location.<br>
      <br>
      [0362] Preferably, in this case, a cleavable covalent linker is
      used to link the targeting ligand to the polymer. Preferably, the
      polymer and targeting ligand become separated upon delivery of the
      polymer to the target. Preferably, the cleavable covalent linker
      reacts to an environmental change that occurs upon delivery of the
      polymer to the target location, causing separation of the polymer
      from the ligand. This environmental change may be a change of pH
      or hypoxia at the target location. Alternatively, cellular (e.g.
      endosomal) enzymes and/or extracellular enzymes (e.g.
      metalloproteinases) may trigger release of the polymer from the
      ligand. Thus, enzymes generated within target tumour cells could
      effect release of the polymer from the ligand, e.g. by cleavage of
      the ligand, allowing the polymer to become active and attack the
      tumour. A protease enzyme, for example, might cleave a peptide
      (amido) bond linking the polymer to the ligand. Such strategies
      are described in Damen, E. W., T. J. Nevalainen, T. J. van den
      Bergh, F. M. de Groot and H. W. Scheeren (2002). "Synthesis of
      novel paclitaxel prodrugs designed for bioreductive activation in
      hypoxic tumour tissue." Bioorg Med Chem 10(1): 71-7.; Cassidy, J.,
      R. Duncan, G. J. Morrison, J. Strohalm, D. Plocova, J. Kopecek and
      S. B. Kaye (1989). "Activity of N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide
      copolymers containing daunomycin against a rat tumour model."
      Biochem Pharmacol 38(6): 875-9; and de Groot, F. M., E. W. Damen
      and H. W. Scheeren (2001). "Anticancer prodrugs for application in
      monotherapy: targeting hypoxia, tumor-associated enzymes, and
      receptors." Curr Med Chem 8(9): 1093-122.<br>
      <br>
      [0363] Alternatively, the cleavable covalent linker may be
      photocleavable. This is especially useful if the polymer of the
      invention is inactive when conjugated to the targeting ligand, and
      active when released from the ligand. Thus, upon delivery of the
      polymer to the desired location (e.g. a particular tumour), the
      tumour can be irradiated in order to cleave the ligand from the
      polymer and render the polymer active at the site of the tumour.<br>
      <br>
      [0364] The use of self-eliminating spacers, linking the polymer to
      the targeting ligand, may also be useful to reconstitue full
      activity of the polymer, as described in de Groot, F. M., C.
      Albrecht, R. Koekkoek, P. H. Beusker and H. W. Scheeren (2003).

        Complexes</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0365] The targeting moieties described above may be associated
      (normally covalently but in principle also non-covalently) with a
      carrier, the carrier also being associated with a polymer used in
      the methods of the invention, so that the targeting moieties are
      presented near the surface of the carrier. This may facilitate
      interaction between the ligand and a 'receptor' that is
      complementary to the targeting ligand. Sometimes spacers or
      tethers are used (see above) to link the ligand to the particulate
      carrier in order to create a steric situation that allows easy
      access. The carrier may be a biocompatible polymer or other
      biomolecule, for example.<br>
      <br>
      [0366] Thus the polymers (including dendrimers) used in the
      present invention, including those of formulae I, III and IV
      described herein, may be associated (e.g. covalently or
      electrostatically) with a carrier. Complexes between such polymers
      and carriers tend to form nanoparticles, which may be a convenient
      form for administration.<br>
      <br>
      [0367] The carrier may be a biomolecule, e.g. a nucleic acid
      (typically DNA), or HA, as described above. The biodistribution,
      bioavailability, biocompatibility and/or physiochemistry of the
      polymer may be improved in such nanoparticle form.<br>
      <br>
      [0368] A nucleic acid carrier as used in this aspect of the
      invention may be incapable of being expressed (i.e. transcribed
      and/or translated); thus when introduced into a target cell, it
      does not give rise to an RNA or protein expression product. For
      example, even if the nucleic acid contains an open reading frame,
      it may contain no promoter (e.g. a promoterless plasmid).<br>
      <br>
      [0369] Alternatively, a polymer may be complexed into nanoparticle
      form by complexation with an active biomolecule, in which case the
      polymer and biomolecule complexed thereto may show synergistic
      effects. For example, a polymer may be complexed with a nucleic
      acid which is capable of being expressed (transcribed and/or
      translated), giving rise to a therapeutically active expression
      product such as a protein or RNA. For example, the carrier may be
      an expression vector encoding a therapeutically useful protein
      such as TNF.<br>
      <br>
      [0370] The effects of complexing DAB16 to a promoterless plasmid
      and an expression plasmid carrying a strong promoter are described
      below and shown in FIG. 7.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Bioactive Molecules</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0371] The bioactive molecule of the composition of the third
      aspect of the invention is preferably anionic at physiological pH,
      preferably carrying more than one negative charge per molecule, in
      order that the cationic groups of the polymer of formula I are
      able to form non-covalent electrostatic interactions with the
      bioactive molecule.<br>
      <br>
      [0372] The bioactive molecule may itself be a polymer, such as
      heparin (a polyanion at physiological pH) or a related polymer,
      e.g. another polymer with a high level of anionic sulphate and/or
      carboxyl substituents. Alternatively, the bioactive molecule may
      be an extracellular matrix polymer such as dextran.<br>
      <br>
      [0373] The bioactive molecule may be a peptide or protein.
      Peptides or proteins having pKa's such that they are negatively
      charged around physiological pH (such as anionic drug molecules)
      are particularly preferable.<br>
      <br>
      [0374] For example, the bioactive molecule may be a polyanion
      which is a potent inhibitor of HIV, e.g. a negatively charged
      albumin, or dextran sulphate. Anionic albumins with potent
      anti-HIV activity are described at <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">(http://www.niwi.knaw.nl/en/oi/nod/onderzoek/OND1270824/toon).</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0375] The bioactive molecule may be a conventional organic drug
      molecule, e.g. with one or more carboxylic acid groups that are
      negatively charged at physiological pH. Examples are diclofenace,
      phenobarbital and barbituric acid.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Gene Delivery</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0376] Without wishing to be limited by any particular theory, it
      is believed that the polymers described herein may exert
      cytostatic effects on tumour cells in vivo. Thus cells treated
      with these polymers may not divide. Non-dividing cells are less
      sensitive to certain cytotoxic drugs than dividing cells of a
      similar type. Thus particular benefits may be achieved by using
      polymers as described above in relation to any aspect of the
      invention for specific types of gene therapy for diseases
      characterised by undesirable cellular proliferation, especially
      neoplastic disease such as cancers as described above.<br>
      <br>
      [0377] Thus the polymers may be used for delivery of a nucleic
      acid (e.g an expression vector) encoding an enzyme capable of
      converting a prodrug to a more active, cytotoxic form, wherein the
      cytotoxic form is more toxic against dividing cells than against
      non-dividing cells.<br>
      <br>
      [0378] Cells which receive the enzyme therefore become capable of
      converting prodrug to drug, but are prevented from proliferating
      by the cytostatic effects of the polymer delivery agent. Thus
      these cells become a source of active drug molecule while at the
      same time becoming more resistant to the effects of the drug than
      surrounding untreated cells. The life of the enzyme-carrying cells
      as a source of active drug molecule is therefore prolonged,
      potentially increasing the efficiency of the treatment. If and
      when the cytostatic effect wears off, the cells will be killed by
      the drug molecule, and thus should not be able to escape to allow
      tumour regrowth.<br>
      <br>
      [0379] Examples of suitable drugs which are more active against
      dividing than non-dividing cells include nucleoside analogues such
      as 5-fluorouracil. Prodrugs include ganciclovir. Enzymes which may
      be used in conjunction with such prodrugs include thymidine kinase
      from Herpes Simplex Virus.<br>
      <br>
      [0380] Thus the invention includes the use of a polymer as
      described above for the preparation of a composition for the
      delivery of a nucleic acid to a cancer cell, the nucleic acid
      encoding an enzyme capable of converting a prodrug to a more
      active, cytotoxic form, wherein the cytotoxic form is more toxic
      against a dividing cell than against a non-dividing cell.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Hydrophobicity</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0381] The polymers used in the present invention can be modified
      by covalently binding derivatising pendant groups, such as
      hydrophobic or hydrophilic groups, to the surface of the
      dendrimer. A combination of hydrophobic and hydrophilic
      substituents may be attached to make hydrophilic polymers
      amphiphilic. Amphiphilicity allows for broad manipulation of
      phsyciochemistry, e.g. for self assembly (formation of polymeric
      vesicles, micelles, etc. and even hydrogels), which is useful for
      modification or optimisation of the in vivo properties of the
      polymer. The number of derivatising groups may vary from one
      derivatising group per polymer molecule up to and including
      derivatising all available surface or terminal groups, for
      example, derivatising all 8 surface groups of a DAB8 molecule or
      all 16 surface groups of a DAB16 molecule. Derivatising dendrimer
      molecules is described in WO 03/033027.<br>

      method below, in which each of the nitrogen atoms of the terminal

      [0397] 500 mg hyaluronic acid (500 mg) was added to acid buffer
      solution [tri-hydroxy methyl-amino methane (0.1M), potassium
      chloride (0.1M), monobasic potassium phosphate (0.1M), anhydrous
      citric acid (0.1M), sodium tetraborate (0.1M), pH=3, 100 ml] and
      subsequently degraded either 24 h or 48 h at 70 C.[deg.]. Degraded
      polymer samples were isolated by exhaustive dialysis against
      distilled water (5 L) with 6 changes over a 24 h period by using
      dialysis tubing with a molecular cut off of 12-14 KD. The dry
      solid was obtained by freeze-drying the dialysate.<br>
      <br>
      [0000] Enzymatic degradation (HAenz)<br>
      <br>
      [0398] Hyaluronic acid (HA, 1 g) (Scheme 1) was dissolved in
      phosphate buffer saline (PBS, ph=7.4, 300 ml) by stirring
      overnight at room temperature. A solution of bovine testis
      hyaluronidase was prepared by dissolving this enzyme (100 mg) in
      PBS (10 ml). Hyaluronic acid solution was heated for 30 min at 37
      C.[deg.] in water bath and then the enzyme solution was added to
      the warm solution and the enzyme hyaluronic acid solution was
      heated for 48 h at 37 C.[deg.]. At the end of this time period the
      solution was boiled for 15 minutes to denature the hyaluronidase.
      The solution was allowed cool and then centrifuged (6000 rpm, 30
      min). The precipitated enzyme was filtered out and then polymer
      solution was isolated by exhaustive dialysis against distilled
      water (5 L) with 6 changes over a 24 h period by using dialysis
      tubing with a molecular cut off of 12,000-14,000 Daltons. The dry

        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0400] DAB8 was conjugated with HA24, HA48 and HAenz. Synthesis of
      these HA-DAB8 conjugates was carried out as depicted in Scheme 2,
      by reaction of DAB8 with low molecular weight hyaluronic acid
      (either HA24, HA48 or HAenz) in the presence of
      1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDAC) at a pH of
      4.75.<br>
      <br>
      [0401] EDAC is a well known carboxyl activating agent for amide
      bonding with primary amines, and may be used to link a biological
      substance containing a carboxylate group (such as HA) with a
      biological substance containing a primary amine (such as a DAB
      polypropylenimine dendrimer).<br>
      <br>
      [0402] Either HA24, HA48 or HAenz (378 mg, 1.0 mmoles carboxylic
      acid groups) were dissolved in water (100 ml). Solid poly
      propylenimine octa amine dendrimer (DAB8, generation 2, 7.73 g, 10
      mmoles, 7.73 ml) was added to the HA solutions. The pHs of the
      solutions were adjusted to pH 4.75 by addition of 0.1M HCl. Solid
      1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDAC) (1.92 g,
      10.0 mmoles) was added to the acid reaction mixtures. The
      reactions were allowed to proceed for 2 h with stirring, the pHs
      adjusted upwards with NaOH (0.1M) to pH=7 and the products
      isolated by exhaustive dialysis against distilled water (5 L) with
      6 changes over a 24 hour period by using dialysis tubing with a
      molecular cut off of 12-14 kD. The dry solids were obtained by
      freeze-drying the dialysates.<br>

        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0404] Synthesis was carried out as depicted in Scheme 3. For the
      quaternarisation of DAB polymers, DAB8 (generation 2), DAB16
      (generation 3), DAB32 (generation 4) or DAB64 (generation 5) (500
      mg, Sigma-Aldrich, UK) was dispersed in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (50
      mL, Sigma-Aldrich, UK) for 16 h at room temperature by stirring.
      To the DAB dispersion was added sodium hydroxide (120 mg, Merck
      Eurolab, UK), methyl iodide (3 g, Sigma-Aldrich, UK) and sodium
      iodide (150 mg, Sigma-Aldrich, UK). The reaction mixture was
      stirred under a stream of nitrogen gas for 3 h at 36[deg.] C. The
      quaternary ammonium product (QDAB8, QDAB16, QDAB32 or QDAB64,
      obtained from DAB8, DAB16, DAB32 or DAB64 respectively) was then
      recovered by precipitation with diethyl ether (500 mL, Merck
      Eurolab, UK) followed by filtration.<br>
      <br>
      [0405] The resulting solid was first quickly washed with absolute
      ethanol (1 L, Merck Eurolab, UK) over a vacuum pump, followed by
      diethyl ether (500 mL). The washed solid (quaternary ammonium
      product) was subsequently dissolved in water (150 mL) and passed
      over an Amberlite anion exchange column. The eluate obtained was
      freeze dried and obtained as a yellow solid, and the structure was
      confirmed by both &lt;1&gt; H and &lt;13&gt; C NMR.<br>
      <br>
      [0406] The Amberlite anion exchange column was prepared by placing
      Amberlite IRA-93 Cl (Merck Eurolab, UK) in a 100 mL separatory
      funnel and washing the resin first with HCL (1 M, 90 mL) followed
      by distilled water (500 mL) until the eluate gave a neutral pH.<br>

      [0410] Animals were injected intravenously (0.2 ml per injection)
      with the different formulations either once or alternatively on a
      schedule every other day (0.5 q.d.) over 10 days (every second
      day, 5 injection). Mice which did not received any treatment
      served as controls. Each group consisted of 5 animals (n=5). As a
      control DAB 16-DNA complexes were prepared as previously described
      [36] by mixing dendrimer and DNA (50 [mu]g) at a 5:1 weight ratio
      in a 5% dextrose solution (200 [mu]l/animal). Free plasmid DNA (50
      [mu]g) was given in 200 [mu]L 5% dextrose. Animals were monitored
      at regular intervals, the tumour size was determined using
      callipers, and body weight measured and recorded. Expression of
      genes containined on nucleic acids complexed with the various
      polymers was measured as described previously [54].<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Results</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0411] Examples of active polymers include large fractured PANAM
      dendrimers (Superfect-L MW 35 kD), linear polymers (Exgen, 22 kD),
      and small dendrimers such as lower generation polypropylenimine
      dendrimers (DAB4-DAB64). These exhibit cytostatic effects towards
      tumour cell lines in vitro.<br>
      <br>
      [0412] A431 epidermoid carcinoma cells were treated with various
      cationic polymers. PEI, Superfect and various DAB polymers were
      added to the culture medium at concentrations of 0.45 [mu]L/mL, 5
      [mu]L/mL and 12.5 [mu]g/mL respectively for the duration of the
      experiment. Untreated cells show typical growth behaviour; triton
      X treated cells show decrease in cell number consistent with cell
      lysis. The cytostatic effects on the tumour cell lines are
      illustrated in FIG. 1.<br>
      <br>
      [0413] Polymers were then administered in vivo. Administration was
      at levels which we would expect to complex similar amounts of DNA,
      not at levels calculated to provide similar cytostatic effects.
      The effect is essentially the same for all materials so it is
      conceivable that the ability of these materials to bind DNA plays
      a role in the effects observed, e.g. through condensation of
      nuclear DNA. All polymers used were well tolerated with no
      apparent signs of gross, systemic toxicity in vivo (FIG. 3).<br>
      <br>
      [0414] DAB8 (PPI G2) kills animals within 5-10 seconds after i.v.
      injection; however no such effect has been observed with any of
      the closely related DABs. By contrast the modified (quaternised)
      QDAB8 is well-tolerated and active (FIGS. 2 and 3). Therefore this
      effect is thought to be unique to underivatised DAB8.<br>
      <br>
      [0415] When administered systemically to treat established A431
      xenograft tumours all the polymers completely inhibit tumour
      growth and in some cases lead to a small reduction in tumour
      volume within the first two weeks (DAB32, PEI; cf. FIG. 2) while
      the untreated tumour grows unchecked.<br>
      <br>
      [0416] Importantly there is no apparent systemic toxicity in vivo
      associated with this highly efficacious treatment. The animals are
      young and continue to grow during treatment. This is reflected in
      the increased body weight for all the formulations (FIG. 3) with
      the possible exception of PEI-treated animals for which the
      decrease is 5-10% less than for the other groups.<br>
      <br>
      [0417] The effect is not unique for a specific tumour but was also
      observed in a number of xenograft models. Here the effect of the
      G3-PPI solution was compared with PP1-G3 DNA complexes carrying an
      expression plasmid for the murine TNFalpha gene (50 [mu]g DNA
      complexed at 5:1 (w/w)) and the free TNFalpha plasmid (50
      [mu]g/animal) in established LS174T colorectal tumours (FIG. 4),
      C33a cervix carcinomas (FIG. 5), and the A431 epidermoid carcinoma
      model (FIG. 6). In each of the tumour models the treatment of
      animals with DAB16 inhibited tumour growth significantly.<br>
      <br>
      [0418] In a long term experiment the repeated administration of
      DAB16 (0.5 q.d. X5) resulted in a decrease of the tumour size from
      day 23 for 2 mice, from day 33 for all the mice. The tumours even
      completely disappeared from day 43 and 51 for 2 mice (n=5) and
      resulted in long term survival of the treated mice (cf. FIG. 7).<br>
      <br>
      [0419] The effect of the cationic polymers does not only depend on
      the injection of the free compound but is also seen when the
      compound is given in the form of nanoparticles (FIG. 7). Both free
      polymers and those complexed into nanoparticles through
      complexation with a promoterless plasmid ("Cplx -p") were
      beneficial. Nanoparticles formed from the expression plasmid
      carrying a strong promoter and the dendrimer were highly active
      and showed synergistic effects ("Cplx 5*"). In contrast no
      beneficial effect was observed when the PPI-G3 and the plasmid
      were administered separately ("DAB+TNF").<br>
      <br>
      [0420] Overall tumour response to treatment was stratified
      according to change in tumour volume, into progressive disease
      (increase greater than 1.2 fold), stable disease (0.7-1.2),
      partial response (0-0.7), and complete response (0), over the
      duration of the experiment (12 weeks) analogous to the RECIST
      criteria (Therasse, P., S. G. Arbuck, et al. (2000). "New
      guidelines to evaluate the response to treatment in solid tumors.
      European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer,
      National Cancer Institute of the United States, National Cancer
      Institute of Canada." J Natl Cancer Inst 92(3): 205-16.) The
      results of this analysis are shown in FIG. 8.<br>
      <br>
      [0421] The magnitude of the effect of the cationic polymers alone
      is similar to that seen with the cytotoxic drug doxorubicin in the
      same tumour model (FIG. 9).<br>
      <br>
      [0422] The polymers may also be targeted to tumours by association
      with a ligand capable of binding to a receptor (e.g. a protein) on
      the surface of a given tumour. Active targeting of DAB16 and DAB8
      was achieved through conjugation of the appropriate dendrimer to a
      hyaluronic acid (HA) backbone. Low molecular weight HA was
      produced by acid hydrolysis or enzymatic cleavage and coupled to
      the dendrimers as described earlier. Hyaluronic acid is the
      natural ligand of the CD44 receptor which is overexpressed in a
      number of tumours but has also been implicated as a marker for
      cancer stem cells [56].<br>
      <br>
      [0423] DNA complexes formed with the targeted polymers show
      preferential uptake in receptor positive cancer cells (B16F10
      murine melanoma) but not in the control cells (NIH 3T3; FIG. 10).
      The targeted complexes also show a higher expression in the
      receptor positive tumours in the syngeneic B16F10 mouse model
      compared to the untargeted complexes (FIG. 11).<br>
      <br>
      [0424] It is established that polymers such as those used in drug
      and gene delivery have an inherent general toxicity which can lead
      to cell death. This has been regarded as a potential problem and
      disadvantage which could impede the use of these molecules as
      delivery agents. A commonly made observation is that cells in
      tissue culture assays will display signs of apoptosis such as
      rounding off and reduction and loss of attachment to the tissue
      culture plate.<br>
      <br>
      [0425] While many compounds exhibit toxicity in cytotoxicity
      assays this does not identify them as potential therapeutics. The
      key properties which distinguish a generally toxic substance from
      a therapeutic agent are the specificity of its action and the
      specificity and selectivity of its toxic effect. Our data (e.g.
      FIGS. 1, 2) demonstrate that the cationic polymers can exert a
      cytostatic effect on tumour cell lines in vitro and therapeutic
      effects on tumours in vivo without systemic toxicity.<br>
      <br>
      [0426] In vitro tissue culture testing of compounds frequently
      involves tumour derived cell lines or transformed cell lines
      because of their favourable growth characteristics which allow
      facile manipulation. As a consequence it is not normally obvious
      to what extent a compound has specificity for diseased cells in
      contrast to healthy cells. An indication of potential specificity
      can be inferred from the differential effects specific compounds
      exhibit against a panel of cell lines, but the key data which
      demonstrates therapeutic potential is activity in animal models of
      cancer, such as murine tumour xenografts, as shown here.<br>
      <br>
      [0427] We have previously recognised that the lower generation
      polypropylenimine dendrimers are synthetic transfection agents
      that mediate efficient transgene expression in vitro [36] and
      after systemic injection do not demonstrate any gross toxicity
      [54]. When such systems are administered in vivo in tumour bearing
      animals, however, the therapeutic effect seen in various tumour
      models is at least as good as that of doxorubicin without the
      systemic toxicity seen by such cytotoxic drugs.<br>
