      <p>The <b>Farnsworth-Hirsch Fusor</b>, or simply <b>fusor</b>,
        is an apparatus designed by Philo T. Farnsworth to create
        nuclear fusion. Unlike most controlled fusion systems, which
        slowly heat a magnetically confined plasma, the fusor injects
        "high temperature" ions directly into a reaction chamber,
        thereby avoiding a considerable amount of complexity. When it
        was first introduced to the fusion research world in the late
        1960s it was the first device that could clearly demonstrate it
        was producing any fusion reactions at all, and hopes were high
        that it could be quickly developed into a practical power
        source. However, as with other fusion experiments, development
        into generator has proven difficult. Nevertheless the fusor has
        since become a practical neutron source, and is produced
        commercially for this role.</p>

    <blockquote><b>History ~</b>
      <p>The fusor was originally conceived by Philo Farnsworth, the man
        who is largely responsible for television. In the early 1930s he
        investigated a number of vacuum tube designs for use in
        television, and found one that led to an interesting effect. In
        this design, which he called the <i>multipactor</i>, electrons
        moving from one electrode to another were stopped in mid-flight
        with the proper application of a high-frequency magnetic field.
        The charge would then accumulate in the center of the tube,
        leading to high amplication. Unfortunately it also led to huge
        amounts of erosion on the electrodes when the electrons
        eventually hit them, and today the multipactor effect is
        generally considered a problem to be avoided at all costs. </p>
      <p>What particularly interested Farnsworth about the device was
        its ability to focus electrons at a particular point. In the
        early days of controlled fusion experiments in the 1950s one of
        the biggest problems was to keep the heated fuel from hitting
        the walls of the container, if this were allowed to happen the
        fuel would rapidly cool off, leading to a huge loss of power.
        Farnsworth reasoned that he could build an electrostatic
        confinement system in which the "walls" of the reactor were
        electrons or ions being held in place by the multipactor. Fuel
        could then be "injected" through the wall, and once inside they
        would be unable to escape. He called this concept a <i>virtual
          electrode</i>, and the system as a whole the fusor. </p>
      <p>His original fusor designs were based on cylindrical
        arrangments of electrodes, like the original multipactors. Fuel
        was ionized and then fired from small accelerators through holes
        in the outer (physical) electrodes. Once through the hole they
        were accelerated towards the inner reaction area at high
        velocity. Electrostatic pressure from the positively charge
        electrodes would keep the fuel as a whole off of the walls of
        the chamber, and impacts from new ions would keep the hottest
        plasma in the center. He referred to as <i>inertial
          electrostatic confinement</i>, a term that continues to be
        used to this day. </p>
      <p>Various models of the fusor were constructed in the early
        1960s. Unlike the original conception, these models used a
        spherical reaction area but were otherwise similar. Farnsworth
        ran a fairly "open" lab, and several of the lab techs also built
        their own fusor designs. Although generally successful the fusor
        had a problem being scaled up, since the fuel was delivered via
        accelerators, the amount of fuel that could be used in the
        reaction was quite low. </p>
      <p>Things changed dramatically with the arrival of Robert Hirsch
        at the lab. He proposed an entirely new way of building a fusor
        without the ion guns or multipactor electrodes. Instead the
        system was constructed as two similar spherical electrodes, one
        inside the other, all inside a larger container filled with a
        dilute fuel gas. In this system the guns were no longer needed,
        and corona discharge around the outer electrodes was enough to
        provide a source of ions. Once ionized the gas would be drawn
        towards the inner (negativily charged) electrode, which they
        would pass by and into the central reaction area. </p>
      <p>The overall system ended up being similar to Farnsworth's
        original fusor design in concept, but used a real electrode in
        the center. Ions would collect near this electrode, forming a
        shell of positive charge that new ions from outside the shell
        would penetrate due to their high speed. Once inside the shell
        they would experience an additional force keeping them inside,
        with the cooler ones collecting into the shell itself. It is
        this later design, properly called the <b>Hirsch-Meeks Fusor</b>,
        that continues to be experimented with today. </p>
      <p>New fusors based on Hirsch's design were first constructed in
        the later 1960s. Even the first test models demonstrated that
        the design was a "winner", and soon they were producing
        production rates of up to a billion per second, and has been
        reported to have observed rates of up to a trillion per second.
      </p>
      <p>All of this work had taken place at the Farnsworth Television
        labs, which had been purchased in 1949 by ITT with plans of
        becoming the next RCA. In 1961 ITT placed Harold Geneen in
        charge as CEO. Geneen decided that ITT was not going to be a
        telephone/electronics company any more, and instituted a policy
        of rapidly buying up companies of any sort. Soon ITT's main
        lines of business were insurance, Sheraton Hotels, Wonderbread
        and Avis Rent-a-Car. In one particularly busy month they
        purchased 20 different companies, all of them unrelated. It
        didn't matter what the companies did, as long as they turned a
        profit. </p>
      <p>A fusion research project didn't. In 1965 the board of
        directors started asking Geneen to sell off the Farnsworth
        division, but he had his 1966 budget approved with funding until
        the middle of 1967. Further funding was refused, and that ended
        ITT's experiments with fusion. The team then turned to the AEC,
        then in charge of fusion research funding, and provided them
        with a demonstration device mounted on a serving cart that
        produced more fusion than any existing "classical" device. The
        observers were startled, but even by this point all available
        funding had been locked up by large research projects who
        resisted any funds being allocated to "new" systems, no matter
        how promising. </p>
      <p>Farnsworth then moved to Brigham Young University and tried to
        hire on most of his original lab from ITT into a new company.
        The company started operations in 1968, but after failing to
        secure several million dollars in seed capital, by 1970 they had
        burned through all of Farnsworth's savings. The IRS seized their
        assets in February 1971, and in March Farnsworth suffered a bout
        of pneumonia and died. The fusor effectively died along with
        him. </p>
      <p>In the early 1980s the round of "big machines" had demonstrated
        themselves to be no more practical than the earlier generations,
        and a number of physicists started looking at alternative
        designs. George Miley at the University of Illinois picked up on
        the fusor, and re-introduced it into the field. The fusor has
        remained a popular device since then, and has even become a
        successful commercial neutron source. <br>
        Basic fusion ~ <br>
        Controlled fusion attempts to cause ions to fuse by forcing them
        together at high energies. The lowest energy reaction occurs in
        a mix of deuterium and tritium, when the ions have to have a
        combined energy of about 4 keV (kilo-electron volts).
        Temperature is the average kinetic energy per unit volume, so
        any energy measure can be converted into a temperature with the
        conversion ratio of 1 eV = 11604.45 K. In this case the D-T
        fusion threshold temperature is about 45 million degrees
        Celsius. </p>
      <p>In order to make such a reaction practical, some significant
        fraction of the expensive fuel used must undergo fusion and
        generate power. This rate varies with temperature, and the total
        number of fusion events with the amount of time that the fuel is
        held at a particular temperature. This relation is known as the
        Lawson Criterion, and contains a Catch-22 &amp;ndash; as the
        temperature of the fuel is increased it becomes increasingly
        difficult to "contain" it for the needed amount of time. </p>
      <p>In traditional designs, this is achieved by slowly heating a
        plasma fuel that is being contained by magnets. This approach
        has proven to be very difficult to achieve in practice, as the
        fuel tends to "leak out" of the reaction area too fast to heat
        it to the required temperatures. Increasingly complex systems
        have been introduced to quickly heat the plasma, but these
        detract from the usefulness of the design for a practical
        generator. <br>
        Fusor fusion ~ <br>
        The fusor attempts to avoid heating problems by adding the
        required energy directly to the ions. Whereas 45 million degrees
        sounds impressive (and is), it is important to remember that it
        corresponds to about 4 keV, the energy that an electron would
        gain by being accelerated between two electrodes charged to 4
        kV. In the grand scheme of things 4 keV is a very minor amount
        of energy &amp;ndash; it is commonly found in such devices as
        neon lights and televisions. </p>
      <p>In the original fusor design, several small particle
        accelerators, essentially TV tubes with the ends cut off,
        provided a small amount of this energy. Once the ions entered
        the reaction chamber they found themselves being pushed towards
        the center by the charge on the electrodes, which was charged to
        about 80 kV. </p>
      <p>In the Hirsch version the basic mechanism consists of two
        concentric spherical grid electrodes in a vacuum chamber
        containing a very dilute fuel gas. Depending on the design, the
        inner electrode is negative and thus accelerates ions toward the
        center of the chamber, or alternately the inner electrode is
        positive and accelerates electrons towards the center. Most
        research has focused on ion acceleration: the ions, being
        heavier, are much easier to focus and give a consistent energy.
      </p>
      <p>In theory the fusor is perhaps the most promising form of
        fusion reactor studied. Energy is added to the fuel directly
        through acceleration, as opposed to the various indirect means
        required in a Tokamak or similar magnetically confined systems.
        Better yet, since the fusor is accelerating the ions (or
        electrons) directly, the range of velocities (or temperatures)
        is quite narrow. This means that most of the ions have enough
        energy to undergo fusion, whereas in a magnetically confined
        system it is typically only the "hottest" ions that can.
        Finally, failed collisions scatter inside the reaction area,
        heating other ions around them, thereby returning some of the
        energy to the reaction. </p>
      <p>Another advantage to the fusor is that any ion can be
        accelerated easily, not just the "low temperature" mixes like
        D-T. This makes the fusor particularly useful when running on
        other potential fusion fuels with much higher threshold
        temperatures. One of the most attractive such combinations is
        the proton - boron-11 reaction, which uses cheap natural
        isotopes, produces only helium, and produces neither neutrons
        nor gamma rays. This is a very clean reaction that would
        dramatically reduce waste when decommissioning a plant, and
        there is considerable interest in such <i>aneutronic</i> fuels.
      </p>
      <p>Nothing in fusion is ever easy however. In the fusor a number
        of problems conspire to rob energy from the ions as they move
        towards the reaction area. One problem is the presence of
        "cooler" unionized particles of gas in the system, which can
        collide with the ions and cool them. Another problem is the
        presence of the inner electrodes, since ions often hit them and
        spray the reaction area with high-mass ions which soak up
        considerable energy from the surrounding fuel through collisions
        and then radiate the heat away as X-rays. This problem plagues
        traditional fusion designs as well, where it is known as <i>sputtering</i>.
      </p>
      <p>A more serious concern was first outlined in 1994. In his
        doctoral thesis for MIT, Todd Rider did a theoretical study of
        all <i>non-equilibrium</i> fusion systems, of which the fusor
        is one of many. He demonstrated that all such systems will leak
        energy at a rapid rate due to Bremsstrahlung, radiation produced
        when electrons in the plasma hit other electrons or ions at a
        cooler temperature and suddenly decelerate. The problem is not
        as pronounced in a hot plasma because the range of temperatures,
        and thus the magnitude of the deceleration, is much less. </p>
      <p>In most of the systems that he studied, the energy radiated
        away from the system was greater than the energy of the fusion
        itself. Unless a significant amount of energy from this
        radiation, namely X-rays, was captured, the system would never
        "break even". The problem is dependent on the mass of the fuel
        ions, so D-T and D-D fuels still provide net energy, but many of
        the more interesting aneutronic fuels appear to be impossible to
        use as an energy source. </p>
      <p><b>Fusor as a Neutron Source ~</b> </p>
      <p>Regardless of its eventual use as an energy source, the fusor
        has already been proven extremely useful as a neutron source.
        Fluxes well in excess of most radiological sources can be made
        from a machine that easily sits on a benchtop, and can be turned
        off at the flick of a switch. Commercial fusors are now produced
        by a number of companies, including such industrial giants as
        DaimlerChrysler. </p>
      <p>Industrial might is not required to build a fusor however, and
        small demonstration fusors that achieve fusion (but not
        break-even!) can and have been constructed by amateurs,
        including high-school students for science projects. Each
        electrode is spot-welded from hoops of stainless-steel wire
        (often welding rod) at right angles. The fusor's electrode
        dimensions are not very critical. The outer electrode can range
        from beach-ball to baseball size, and the inner from baseball to
        ping-pong ball size. Usually such projects use the high-voltage
        transformer from a neon sign, and high voltage rectifier from a
        hobby shop. Spark plug wires carry the power, with spark plugs
        to pass it into the vacuum chamber. Deuterium is available in
        lecturer bottles and is not a controlled nuclear material.
        Neutrons can be sensed by measuring induced radioactivity in
        aluminium foil after moderating the neutrons with wax or
        plastic, or a plastic neutron luminescent material can be used
        with a photodetector. The major expense is the vacuum pump. Note
        that the voltages are dangerous (though less dangerous than a
        TV), and neutron emissions do present some hazard. The X-ray
        emissions are less than those of a color TV since the voltages
        are less. </p>

      <p>Inertial electrostatic confinement (often abbreviated as IEC)
        of a plasma can be achieved with electrostatic fields which
        accelerate charged particles (either ions or electrons)
        directly, in a confined space. Ions can be confined with IEC in
        order to achieve nuclear fusion. </p>
      <p>The Farnsworth-Hirsch Fusor is a specific implementation of an
        IEC device which is popular, since costs for building a simple
        one can run between $500 to $4000 (in 2003 U.S. dollars). Other
        IEC devices include ion guns. </p>
      <p>Due to the simple and relatively inexpensive nature of these
        devices many backyard, science fair, and university researchers
        are working on IEC class devices. They are able to observe
        reproducible, convincing evidence of fusion reactions, however,
        these devices are orders of magnitude from breakeven (the energy
        input far exceeds the energy output). </p>
      <p>These devices produce harmful radiation (neutrons, gamma rays,
        x-rays), and require high voltages and could therefore be
        dangerous if proper care is not taken. </p>
      <p>Experts argue whether an IEC fusion device is capable of
        breakeven. Some researchers in the field hope that the
        inefficiencies of the design could be overcome through optimized
        or hybird designs and the IEC could be a low-cost path to
        fusion. </p>

      </center>
      <p>A really distressing trend has been developing for some time
        among science fiction fans I've met. A lot of you are growing
        quite pessimistic about the prospects for practical fusion power
        in general, and fusion powered space travel in particular. The
        roots of this disillusionment are not hard to find. </p>
      <p>Fusion, for those of you who slept through high-school physics,
        is the process of squashing two atomic nuclei together to
        produce a new element. Many lightweight nuclei give off copious
        energy when this happens. In the Sun, hydrogen nuclei fuse
        (through a complex cycle involving carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen)
        to form helium. The process occurs deep in the Sun's core, at
        mind-boggling temperatures that cause the nuclei to move
        rapidly, where similarly mind-boggling pressure keeps the nuclei
        in close proximity, and sheer bulk prevents rapid heat escape.
        The physics community often calls these "thermonuclear
        reactions" because of the high temperatures driving them in the
        Sun, or triggering them in "hydrogen" bombs, </p>
      <p>When I was studying Health Physics in the mid-seventies, the
        nation was well into a program to develop "practical, clean
        thermonuclear fusion power." This was universally acknowledged
        to be a considerable technical challenge, but we were told to
        expect results in, say, twenty-five to thirty years. Well,
        twenty-plus years have come and gone, along with twelve billion
        fusion research dollars (over the past 45 years), and those
        researchers have announced that they have made a great deal of
        progress. They say if we will only fork over the money (another
        ten to twelve billion) for the next stage of R&amp;D, they think
        they might be able to build a net power demonstration reactor in
        another twenty years. This should lead to a workable fusion
        powerplant in about forty or fifty years, for another $25
        billion. Present indications are that the resulting powerplant
        would not be able to run competitively with any current
        powerplant technology. </p>
      <p>The focus of most of the present Department of Energy (DOE)
        research is large tokamaks. How large? The next generation of
        research machine planned, with the supporting equipment and
        structure, will be about the volume and mass of an aircraft
        carrier. It is expected to use gigantic toroidal superconducting
        magnets, storing magnetic energy equivalent to 1/40 of a
        Hiroshima bomb, which would be released suddenly if the liquid
        helium cooling system were ever breached and any one of the
        magnets warmed above the critical superconducting temperature.
        Surrounding the machine is a blanket of molten lithium one to
        two meters thick. The core of the machine is a torus (donut)
        sixteen meters high and twenty-two meters across with a
        cross-section diameter of five meters, filled with a
        stupefyingly potent confined plasma, whose structural material
        will become radioactive as the machine runs. This beast might
        actually hit breakeven occasionally (i.e., produce as much power
        as it consumes), with a little luck. Presuming working power
        plants would be even larger and heavier, the system does not
        look promising for strapping on the back of a rocket! </p>
      <p>Additional work continues on laser and particle beam-fired
        fusion. The reaction vessels proposed for this program are
        considerably smaller, however the lasers or beam guns and power
        systems to run them are even larger and more massive than those
        of the tokamaks, making them prohibitive for space propulsion
        use. </p>
      <p>Both systems struggle to overcome the three competing factors
        which have so far made thermonuclear fusion such a formidable
        challenge. The goal is to slam fuel nuclei together hard enough
        to make them stick and form new elements. Nuclei carry a
        positive charge, and like charges repel, and they do so more
        vigorously the closer they approach. This Coulomb barrier" is
        the force which must be overcome to cause fusion. To make a
        useful power reactor, you must have particle velocity, density,
        and confinement time sufficient to produce enough reactions to
        generate more power than is required to drive the reaction. </p>
      <p>Tokamaks use magnetic confinement, and inject energy into the
        confined plasma (typically by huge current discharges or bursts
        of microwave energy) to heat the plasma to temperatures which
        raise the velocity of the nuclei to overcome the Coulomb
        barrier. The powerful magnets surrounding the reactor force the
        plasma ions (ions are atoms missing some or all of their
        electrons) to follow tight circular paths within the machine,
        isolating the plasma from the walls and giving high confinement
        time, thus opportunity to react. However, there are practical
        limits to magnetic field strength, and those limits are felt
        most severely under the conditions where trapping is most
        needed. Fast-moving ions needed to cause fusion make larger
        orbits than slower, cooler ions, and thus temperature and
        density are in constant conflict. There is also an inherent
        stability problem in these machines: when ions collide without
        causing fusion (which is most collisions in a thermal system),
        they tend to "jump to new field lines." Just a few collisions
        will likely make them jump to the wall of the machine. The net
        result is that while large tokamaks using superconducting
        magnets placed outside the torus and lithium blanket can confine
        hot ions for long times at low density, or cold ions for long
        times at higher density, you must build very large machines in
        order to achieve sufficiently high temperature (high ion
        velocity) and high density at the same time. </p>
      <p>Laser- and particle beam-fired approaches (called Inertial
        Confinement Fusion, or ICF) use small pellets or capsules of
        fusion fuel flash-heated by extremely powerful lasers or
        particle beam pulses. The fuel is usually liquid or even solid,
        so initial density is fairly high, although this system requires
        the fuel to be compressed to a far higher density in order to
        react. The capsule is not just a fuel container; it serves to
        absorb the laser or beam energy, compress the fuel as the
        capsule explodes, and provide mass (and inertia) to confine the
        heated fuel long enough to react. The challenges in ICF stem
        from the fact that high temperature causes rapid expansion of
        the capsule and fuel: temperature and confinement time are in
        conflict. ICF machines also have their own instability problem:
        once you compress the fuel pellet to a small fraction of its
        normal size, it will find any little gap in what you are
        compressing it with, and try to squirt out. So far these
        problems have frustrated attempts to produce useful ICF fusion.
      </p>
      <p>Both of these methods have achieved some limited success; that
        is, they have produced fusion, far below breakeven. However,
        both use heat as the means of raising the velocity of the ions,
        what physicists call "Maxwellian" (randomly oriented and
        distributed) velocity. Stephen L. Gillett would use the term
        "Promethean", for Prometheus, the bringer of fire. Both
        approaches rely on the principle that a heated plasma contains a
        wide distribution of particle velocities. "Temperature," in the
        sense of gas and plasma physics, is the average kinetic energy
        of the particles involved, and kinetic energy is proportional to
        particle mass and the square of the velocity. </p>
      <p>The trouble is, neither approach brings the average ion kinetic
        energy up high enough to cause fusion. Only the fastest few
        percent of ions reach the energy needed to overcome the mutual
        repulsion of the Coulomb barrier. Furthermore, the heated ions
        move randomly in all directions, thus collisions are at random
        angles which usually do not produce fusion. What they need is
        particles hitting head-on at fusion energies; but what goes on
        in thermal systems, at the particle level, is virtually
        uncontrolled chaos: fast and slow particles colliding like
        bumper cars at all angles. </p>
      <p>Finally, while these heat-based methods do produce some fusion,
        they do so only with the easiest of fuels: deuterium ("heavy
        hydrogen," with a nucleus of one proton and one neutron),
        tritium (one proton with two neutrons), and helium-3 (two
        protons and one neutron). Thermonuclear fusion has been pushed
        on the public as "clean," i.e. not producing nuclear waste. This
        turns out not to be quite the case. Reactions between two
        deuterium nuclei (DD), or deuterium and tritium (DT) produce
        neutrons. Most of the useable energy in the favored DT systems
        comes from the neutrons, and the only way to exploit it is to
        slow them down in a blanket of absorbing fluid (usually liquid
        lithium) which is then used to make steam to run a turbine (more
        Promethean technology). In fact, the DT systems depend on
        neutrons reacting with the lithium to produce more tritium fuel,
        for tritium is a fast-decaying radioactive isotope not found in
        nature. The neutron-lithium reaction also breeds helium-3. </p>
      <p>From time to time you may hear about this miraculous nuclear
        fuel, helium-3, which supposedly can be mined from the lunar
        surface (actually, the Jovian atmosphere is probably afar better
        source). The claim often heard is that the reaction between
        deuterium and helium-3 produces no neutrons. While this is true,
        any such reactor will also produce deuterium-deuterium
        reactions, which will produce neutrons. While it is a
        substantial improvement over tritium, it is far from aneutronic.
        If a DT reactor could kill you in one second, a DHe` reactor
        would require about thirty seconds to kill you. Besides, as
        mentioned above, that lithium blanket has a purpose: it reacts
        with the neutrons to produce tritium and helium-3! The
        aneutronic reaction can't breed its own fuel, but the
        neutron-producers can. </p>
      <p>While the neutrons produced by these reactions can be harnessed
        to make heat and more fuel, they have very undesirable side
        effects. They render many engineering materials radioactive,
        transmute their elements, and produce metallurgical damage.
        Thus, after a few years of operation, the inside of the reactor
        becomes weakened and possibly even deformed. Repairs and
        disposal of the damaged material are greatly complicated because
        it is radioactive. </p>
      <p><b>Fusion the Easy Way --- Using Vacuum Tube Technology ~</b> </p>
      <p>There are a variety of other potential fusion fuels for which
        the necessary temperatures for fusion are simply too high to be
        achieved by the thermonuclear technologies DOE is currently
        pursuing. How do we know about these reactions? We have been
        doing them since 1928, using extremely simple devices called
        linear accelerators . Charged particles can be made to
        accelerate to enormous velocities and energies by means of
        simple electric fields. By charging a grid to a few hundred
        thousand volts, you can accelerate protons or other light nuclei
        fast enough to fuse with almost any element in the periodic
        table. True, it takes far more energy to run such a device than
        it produces, but the equipment is extremely simple, and the
        "temperatures' achieved are easily sufficient to produce most
        transmutation reactions between nuclei. </p>
      <p>Let's bury this "temperature" nonsense right here and now.
        While you may have heard a figure of something like fifty or a
        hundred million degrees being required to produce fusion, in
        fact few researchers use those numbers except to impress the
        public. The units of temperature they use are "electron volts,"
        which are easily understood in terms of linear accelerator
        operation. For every electron's worth of charge on a particle,
        multiply by the volts on the accelerating grid to get
        electron-volts of energy. For purposes of impressing your
        friends, for each electron volt, multiply by 11,604 to get
        degrees Kelvin. You may be amused to know the electrons hitting
        the screen of the typical television set are around 200 million
        degrees according to this scheme, and 50 million degrees is a
        paltry 4300 electron volts. </p>
      <p>At about the same time linear accelerators were first being
        developed, development of vacuum tubes, or electron valves, was
        being refined. Vacuum tubes use the principle that a very hot
        metal surface will emit a cloud of electrons, which can be
        caused to cross a gap in a vacuum to a positively charged
        "anode." In simple diode vacuum tubes, a hot tungsten filament
        or heated thin cylindrical surface (the "cathode") is surrounded
        by a cylindrical anode (also called the "plate") and electrons
        will flow from cathode to the anode, but not from the anode to
        the cathode. </p>
      <p>One of the best-known researchers in the field was Irving
        Langmuir, who had developed theories and confirmed by
        experiments the principles of "space charge limitation" between
        tube elements composed of concentric cylinders. In 1924,
        Langmuir and Katharine Blodgett investigated the case of
        concentric spheres as a vacuum tube configuration. While the
        device worked well, the normal configuration was concentric
        cylinders, which were much easier to manufacture and also worked
        well, so there was no widespread use made of this development at
        the time. Limited use of the spherical configuration includes
        some "multipactor" tubes and certain specialized light sources.
      </p>
      <p>In the mid-1950's, P. T. Farnsworth (one of the inventors of
        television) pondered the bright visible convergent focus glow
        that forms in the center of spherical multipactor tubes, and
        came up with the idea of using a spherical diode with the inner
        electrode in the form of a highly transparent wire grid (i.e. a
        very open mesh screen) as a fusion machine. Called the 'Fusor,"
        the device, later patented, would cause ions of fusion fuel to
        speed to the center of the machine. As they converged on the
        central focus region, their density would increase rapidly,
        making collisions more likely. Ions which did not collide would
        decelerate out the other side, stop, and accelerate back to the
        center for another try, conserving energy. The class of machines
        based on this principle are "spherical convergent focus
        electrostatic ion accelerators," with the abbreviation IXL to
        remind us that they use the grids to accelerate ions (see figure
        1). Because they use simple electrostatic forces to accelerate
        and confine ions, and rely on the inertia of the ions to store
        energy for collisions, the term Inertial Electrostatic
        Confinement (IEC) is used for machines of this type. Be careful
        not to confuse it with ICF, or laser/particle beam fusion. </p>
      <p>By 1959, Elmore, Tuck, and Watson explored the idea of using
        Farnsworth's gizmo backwards to accelerate electrons from the
        outer sphere (a cathode) to the inner sphere (an anode). The
        inner sphere of such a machine is a grid, which forms a geodesic
        "potential surface" which the electrons aim for as if it were
        solid. However, when they get there, most pass right through and
        coast in a straight line, converging from all sides to the
        center, then they pass out the other side. What results is a
        region at the center of the inner sphere with a very high
        density of negative charge, called a "virtual cathode." This
        region will attract positively-charged ions, which will tend to
        oscillate back and forth through the central region. Provided
        more electrons are force-fed into the system than ions, a
        "potential well" is formed in which the ions are trapped by
        excess negative charge. Interestingly, an ion oscillating
        entirely inside the inner grid will be trapped almost
        indefinitely, thus theory predicted this device might be a
        surprisingly efficient ion trap. However, the electrons had to
        pass through the grid, which meant eventually most of them would
        hit the grid. Depending on the grid's "transparency," an
        electron might make 10 to 50 passes before being lost, requiring
        another electron and the power to fire it into the system.
        Because the electrons had to outnumber the ions by a significant
        margin, the researchers expected this device could be harnessed
        to produce only tiny amounts of fusion, and decided it could
        never make a workable power reactor. The Elmore, Tuck, Watson
        concept is an electron accelerator, or EXL machine. </p>
      <p>In 1967, Robert L. Hirsch published a paper describing a
        concentric sphere device which produced "copious neutron
        emission". Hirsch (working at the ITT/Farnsworth Lab under
        Farnsworth's enthusiastic encouragement) used the IXL
        configuration, with the cathode (negative grid) in the center
        and the anode (positive) to the outside. His machine was a
        spherical version of a linear accelerator: positive ions formed
        at the anode accelerated toward the central cathode grid (the
        opposite of the behavior of electrons, which are negatively
        charged). Again, the accelerated particles usually miss the
        inner grid, continuing on to the center of the device. There
        they stood a fair chance of collision, and very importantly, all
        of the particles were at the same energy, which was sufficiently
        high for fusion to occur. If they missed or collided without
        producing fusion, they could travel out the other side,
        conserving their energy for another pass through the middle.
        Although not all collisions were headon, particles which did not
        fuse rebounded with most of their original energy. It did not
        matter to which direction they rebounded, as all directions were
        uphill" against the potential gradient, so they slowed down, and
        came rushing back "downhill" for another try. Like the Elmore,
        Tuck, Watson design, the losses due to grid collisions prevented
        breakeven, but a lot of fusion was possible, nonetheless. </p>
      <p>Dr. Hirsch operated his machine at up to -150,000 volts on the
        inner grid, at currents up to 60 milliamps. Using DD and DT, the
        machine produced abundant fusion, but far below breakeven. The
        neutron emissions he achieved (published results on the order of
        a billion neutrons per second, and unpublished results of around
        a trillion per second!) would be considered dangerous today.
        Hirsch also built an ElmoreTuck-Watson EXL machine, and verified
        it would produce a deep potential well. </p>
      <p>What Hirsch's machine demonstrated was that, contrary to
        popular belief, fusion is actually quite easy to produce, once
        the thermo mindset is shed. The problem is to come up with a
        configuration that does not waste the drive energy. </p>
      <p><b>The Nuclear Reactor High-School Science Project ~</b> </p>
      <p>I notice a few of you have gone glassy eyed on me. Trust me,
        this is easy. A Farnsworth-Hirsch machine is so simple it could
        be built as a high-school science project (though I caution that
        a knowledgeable advisor should be sought, and good safety
        practices must be followed). You will need to borrow, buy, or
        build some vacuum equipment, obtain a small supply of deuterium,
        and figure out some instruments so you can tell if it is
        working, but the actual reactor components are trivially simple
        to build, and will cost only a few cents! </p>
      <p><b>WARNING! </b>The apparatus described in this article uses
        high voltages at potentially lethal currents. High vacuum
        apparatus and compressed gasses may also be dangerous if
        improperly used. This device may produce ultraviolet radiation
        and soft x-rays. Do not attempt to build or operate such a
        device unless you have been trained in high voltage safety, and
        safe use of compressed gas cylinders and vacuum equipment, and
        can verify that no unsafe radiation exposure occurs. </p>
      <p>Regarding the presumed danger of building a nuclear reactor,
        the simple fact is that the proposed machine would run at the
        very bottom end of the voltage required for fusion, and it will
        take some skill and effort to even detect the neutron output.
        The real danger is in the potentially lethal high voltages used,
        and some lesser concerns for safe handling of compressed
        flammable gas and operation of vacuum equipment. A metal vacuum
        vessel will stop virtually all of the weak x-rays which may be
        produced (a little tamer than those produced by a television),
        and a thick glass window will stop most ultraviolet radiation
        produced. The voltages involved are somewhat lower than those
        present in an ordinary television set, which also has a large,
        fragile, glass vacuum vessel, and I would characterize the
        project as about as dangerous as television repair. They still
        teach television repair in high school technical education
        programs, don't they? But make no mistake, the insides of a
        television set can kill you in a heartbeat. </p>
      <p>While you will wish to rig a method for detecting and
        quantifying neutron production (that being your proof you are
        making fusion), the levels produced by the machine described
        below should be so low you would have to stand a meter away from
        the machine for twelve days of continuous operation before you
        got a 100 mrem dose of neutrons (and that is a trivial dose).
        Most likely, the device will be run only for a few minutes at a
        time at actual fusion conditions. Still, if for no other reasons
        than the educational benefits and common sense, I would advise
        the experiment be done with due consideration to nuclear safety.
        For those wusses who don't wish to "go nuclear," or who cannot
        find qualified advisors, you can still demonstrate the visible
        glow by using a non-nuclear gas (the residual air in the vacuum
        chamber will do) running at below fusion voltages. In fact, even
        without producing fusion, you can do a lot of interesting and
        useful science with these devices. </p>
      <p>The expensive component is the vacuum system, which may have to
        be borrowed or scrounged. The pressure required can be achieved
        by a simple mechanical rotary-vane roughing pump (a two-stage
        "micron" pump used for refrigeration repair will do) if the
        system is compact and tight, although it would be preferable to
        have a higher-performance system. Such a pump, used, can cost
        around $750 (a lucky scrounger I know has stumbled onto several
        for $150 or less), so a borrowed pump will be a real advantage
        if you are as broke as I chronically was in high school. A
        vacuum chamber and some high-voltage and conventional electrical
        feedthroughs will be needed. A metal vacuum chamber with a thick
        glass viewport is far preferable, and I managed to find
        materials for one at a scrapyard for $30. I have built a small
        demonstrator device in a $90 plastic desiccator chamber, but it
        did not achieve good enough conditions for fusion, finally
        failed due to a stray electron beam heating the walls, and
        provided little protection against x-rays or ultraviolet light.
        Glass vacuum containers such as bell jars are fragile and
        consequently dangerous, and must be used with guards, face
        protection, and with great care. Spark plugs will do as high
        voltage feedthroughs, and spark plug wire for high voltage
        cable, for researchers who are "cash-chalk lenged." Homemade
        vacuum instruments can be made from light bulbs or old vacuum
        tubes. </p>
      <p>I have achieved the blue glow of convergent ion focus using a
        furnace ignition transformer and a pair of high-voltage diodes.
        This will produce close to five thousand volts, and ignition
        transformers are usually current-limited to a level that
        probably won't stop a healthy teenage heart. Such a transformer
        will not produce significant fusion, but makes a pretty glow
        which will demonstrate the convergence effect. </p>
      <p>Higher voltage and power can be obtained using a 15,000 volt
        (7,500 volt RMS centertapped) neon sign transformer with two
        high voltage diodes, which can produce over 10,000 peak volts
        DC, and considerably more current than the ignition
        transformers. I have successfully pushed such a transformer to
        13,000 volts. This power source can produce measurable fusion.
        Before buying one, check with an electrical contractor who
        remodels commercial property, as they frequently dispose of such
        transformers from old neon signs. You would prefer the
        higher-current 60mA variety if you can get it, and need at least
        a 30mA unit. This transformer can kill, particularly if you use
        a capacitor on it to filter the AC ripple. </p>
      <p>Deuterium gas is not radioactive, and can be purchased without
        special license through many gas suppliers, sometimes even
        through welding suppliers. A lecture bottle should cost around a
        hundred dollars, and you will also need a suitable regulator,
        which you may be able to borrow, or at least re-sell after you
        are done with it. </p>
      <p>The reactor grids themselves will cost a few cents and take
        about an hour to build, if you have access to a small
        spotwelder. What, no spotwelder?!! Build one yourself with
        common parts from an electronics store . Each grid can be formed
        from six rings of stainless steel welding wire. I have used
        0.025 inch diameter wire, which is cheap and easy to work. Buy
        it from any welding supply dealer. Figure 2 shows how to fit the
        rings into geodesic spheres. The dimensions can be adjusted to
        fit your apparatus. Typically the outer grid is somewhere
        between the size of a beach ball down to the size of a
        volleyball, and the inner grid is from the size of a softball
        down to the size of a ping-pong ball. You may gather from this
        that precision in diameter is not an issue. It also is
        surprisingly unimportant that the grids be perfectly spherical
        or mathematically precise. </p>
      <p>While a specially-built neutron counter is the most convenient
        way to detect neutrons, there are at least two cheaper methods.
        Neutrons react with many elements to produce new elements, which
        are frequently radioactive. Plain old aluminum is one such
        element, and another is indium foil. Gamma rays from the
        products can be measured by a Geiger counter (I have seen plans
        for home-made models in reference 7), or can be detected by
        sensitive photographic film. Neutrons from fusion must be slowed
        down to make these reactions work, a process called
        "moderating." Two good moderating compounds are water and
        paraffin wax. There are also special plastics available which
        produce tiny flashes of light when hit by neutrons, which can be
        electronically or photographically detected. </p>
      <p>A professional lab could probably manage to sink $50,000 in
        equipment for such a project. Purchasing used equipment, you
        could probably build a simple unit for well under $2,000. I
        suspect a particularly talented scrounge/beggar could get by for
        around $500 out of pocket, which I estimate could be raised in
        under a month of flipping burgers, or a couple of days of
        computer consulting. </p>
      <p>At higher pressures (about one onehundred-thousandth of
        atmospheric pressure), the system will work in "glow discharge
        mode," the way a neon sign works. This is the easy way to go, as
        it requires no fancy electron guns or extra power supplies.
        Those of you with access to higher performance vacuum systems
        may wish to venture to lower pressures, where the recirculation
        becomes far more efficient. This requires a source of electrons
        to generate ions. There are a number of ways to do this, but
        they are too involved for this article. These methods are
        described in the referenced papers, and can also be accomplished
        with cheap and available odds and ends. </p>
      <p>If you jack the inner grid voltage on this simple little
        machine up to l0,000 volts or more, and feed deuterium to the
        system at a pressure a little under 10 microns, it should
        produce fusion, evidenced by net neutrons I have seen a
        17-year-old build a grid that produced 300,000 neutrons a second
        at 13,000 volts. </p>
      <p>So you see, you can build a fusion reactor with parts from an
        electronics store, auto parts store, welding shop, refrigeration
        supplier, hardware store, and craft store, perhaps with a bit of
        dumpster-diving on the side, and creative use of big, sad,
        pleading eyes. It really doesn't take tens of billions of
        dollars! </p>
      <p>These hints should be enough to get you started. I don't want
        to describe the apparatus too completely, because hitting the
        books and figuring this out is how you earn that science fair
        prize dancing before your eyes right now. </p>
      <p><b>Can The Problems Be Overcome?</b> </p>
      <p>While machines based on Farnsworth's Fusor are indeed easy to
        build, and worked better than any thermonuclear fusion machines
        until quite recently, it was immediately apparent to the
        researchers that they could never reach breakeven. The reason,
        quite simply, was that either configuration required grids, and
        grids simply could not be built more than about 98% transparent
        and be expected to support their own weight, especially as they
        typically run red hot when fusion conditions are achieved. The
        machines seemed doomed to operate at no more than 0.01% of
        breakeven. A few researchers struggle on, tantalized by the fact
        that the machines seem to have modes of operation which are
        better than theory predicted. Dr. George Miley of the University
        of Illinois has shown that a "star mode" develops in which
        recirculation passes primarily through the grid openings,
        reducing grid losses. There also appears to be considerable
        fusion occurring immediately outside the convergent focus
        region, where head-on collisions dominate, which was neglected
        in early analysis. Still, these improvements fall far short of
        what is needed for a power reactor. </p>
      <p>Basically, the grids had to disappear! </p>
      <p>A way may be forthcoming. The actual inventor of the scheme
        below asked me to drop my original glowing testimonial. He is
        entirely too modest, if you ask me, but I understand his
        motives. Still, he isn't getting off without his name being
        mentioned here, and at least a few of his extensive
        accomplishments. You may have heard of him as the inventor of
        the interstellar ramjet concept featured in Tau Zero and many
        other science fiction stories: Dr. Robert W. Bussard. In the
        1950's, he proposed and designed a workable nuclear fission
        rocket engine, which led to KIWI-A, the first predecessor of
        NERVA. KIWI-A was ready to test before Sputnik was launched. </p>
      <p>Dr. Bussard also worked with Dr. Hirsch in the thermonuclear
        fusion program at the old Atomic Energy Commission, predecessor
        of the DOE. Both of them recognized the finer points of the IEC
        machines, and wondered if a way could be found to get around the
        grid problem. </p>
      <p>When life hands you a lemon, it has been said, you should make
        lemonade. Dr. Bussard was struggling with another of his
        inventions, a small tokamak called the Riggatron, which looked
        marginally workable, but had turned out to be far too expensive
        to build with the available money. The enormous energy required
        to bring the magnets up to a field strength that would trap the
        plasma would require a monster flywheel-generator that was
        simply way over budget. The problem with tokamaks, he realized,
        was that ions are so damnably hard to trap with magnetic fields,
        particularly under fusion conditions. Yes, using
        superconductors, or by putting copper coils very close to the
        plasma and pushing them to their limits, it was possible to trap
        light ions like deuterium and tritium, but as soon as they
        collided they would tend to jump field lines, unless the fields
        were especially powerful. Achieving that field strength was
        turning out to be a killer problem. </p>
      <p>It was a pity, Bussard thought, that ions are not as simple to
        trap with magnetic fields as are electrons. Because electrons
        are thousands of times lighter than fusion fuel ions, they are
        deflected easily by much weaker magnetic fields. If the little
        tokamak contained only electrons, they could be held at high
        energy and density quite efficiently. And then an epiphany
        struck. </p>
      <p>It might just be possible to build an EXL machine with
        magnetically insulated grids. The magnetized grids would
        accelerate electrons just as well as wire grids, but it would be
        next to impossible for the electrons to actually bit the grid.
        Ions formed just inside the grid would be drawn into the
        potential well and oscillate until they collided, totally
        unimpeded by grids, and trapped by the one thing that holds them
        vigorously-an electrostatic potential. From time to time, theory
        seemed to pose a fatal obstacle, but each time a closer analysis
        of the obstacle revealed a solution that made the theory work
        even better. </p>
      <p>Funding was found to build a largescale (1-meter radius)
        machine, which demonstrated that the system could produce a deep
        potential well. Further small-scale work showed successful
        magnetic trapping of dense electron clouds. Theory and computer
        simulation seem to support the models and experiments, with no
        roadblock problems found, yet. </p>
      <p>The theory and preliminary lab studies look good. A few million
        dollars would fund a working prototype, and if that doesn't
        work, indications are that scaling up a factor of ten in volume
        almost certainly would. While not cheap for most of us, compared
        to the DOE budget for the last 20 years it is practically petty
        cash. Will it succeed? At this point, only time will tell. </p>
      <p><b>The Possibilities ~</b> </p>
      <p>If successful, the impact of this type of reactor would be
        enormous. I need not describe the overall economic consequences
        in too great a detail to this audience: science fiction is
        chock-full of stories in which we developed cheap, clean fusion
        to replace petrochemical fuels and to power our spacecraft.
        However, Bussard's magnetic-grid EXL version of the Fusor shows
        promise as a power source that sounds like science fiction. One
        reason is that it doesn't have to run on nasty neutron-producing
        fuels like deuterium and tritium. </p>
      <p>As mentioned earlier there are many nuclei which can produce
        net fusion energy besides deuterium, tritium, and helium-3. Most
        of them are not commonly discussed, because they require far
        higher collision energies than DT reactions. Since DT reaction
        conditions themselves are a formidable challenge for
        thermonuclear approaches, the other fuels are simply out of the
        question for tokamaks or ICF systems. These limitations become
        almost trivial in spherical convergent focus accelerators,
        however. By simply jacking the voltage up to a couple of hundred
        kilovolts, the electrons can be made to produce a deeper
        potential well, and the ions race to the focus region faster.
        This requires scaling up the hardware, but does not appear to
        require any great leaps of technology. </p>
      <p>Among the fusion fuels is a favorite of Dr. Bussard: the
        reaction between ordinary hydrogen nuclei (protons) and
        boron-11. Boron can be mined as borax or other minerals, and is
        readily extracted from seawater. About 80% of natural boron is
        the boron-11 isotope. The fuel is plentiful. </p>
      <p>The p-B11 reaction is ideal: When the two nuclei fuse. they
        form excited carbon-12, which is unstable and almost immediately
        begins to fly apart. In two rapid stages, it casts off an
        energetic alpha particle (a helium nucleus), then the remaining
        nucleus splits into a pair of alpha particles. The first
        particle, carries 43% of the reaction energy, and comes off at
        precisely 3.76 million electron volts, which turns out to be
        very handy. The other two alphas come off at an average of 2.46
        million electron volts each, over a spread of energies. Finally,
        the reaction produces no neutrons or high-energy gamma rays.
        There is a little bremsstrahlung ("braking radiation" basically
        x-rays) from collisions associated with the reaction, easily
        shielded. Alpha particles are dangerous if produced in your
        body, but can be stopped by the thinnest of shields, and are
        essentially harmless in a reactor vessel. Once they pick up two
        electrons, alpha particles become helium, a harmless inert gas.
        There is no radioactive waste produced in this reaction! </p>
      <p>Lithium can also undergo similar reactions, producing charged
        particles, and is an alternative fuel for such a reactor. Most
        nuclear power generation systems produce heat by one mechanism
        or another, which is in turn used to heat a "working fluid" to
        run turbines or otherwise do mechanical work. The process of
        converting heat to mechanical energy by such means is inherently
        inefficient. Rarely does more than about a third of the energy
        end up in usable electrical or mechanical form, and the
        theoretical limit is around 40% for most practical fluids,
        engine materials, and operating temperatures. This fact has
        depressed thermodynamics students for the last century or so,
        but there appears to be no getting around it using primitive
        "Promethean" technology. </p>
      <p>While you could simply, allow the alpha particles from the
        p-B11 reaction to slam into the reactor walls producing heat,
        there turns out to be a much better way to extract their energy.
        Alpha particles, which are helium atoms stripped of their two
        electrons, have a charge of +2. Each of the particles produced
        by this reaction has a kinetic energy of around 3 million
        electron volts. An electron volt is the energy a particle of
        charge 1 will pick up when accelerated through a field of 1
        volt. The reverse is true, too. To slow down a 3MeV particle
        with a charge of +2, simply decelerate it with a
        +1.5-million-volt electric field. The particle will just kiss
        into the charged surface, and draw two electrons from it,
        producing current at high voltage. This method has been used to
        extract small amounts of power from alpha-emitting radioactive
        substances, and should also work for a large reactor of the
        correct configuration. The correct configuration is a spherical
        vacuum chamber (which this reactor just happens to be) with
        several charged grids to pick off the lower energy alphas, and
        the outer walls charged to catch the high energy alpha. It
        should be possible to approach 95% conversion of fusion energy
        to electricity with such a system (the rest being lost to
        bremsstrahlung and a few other minor mechanisms). This is quite
        remarkable-a nuclear reaction which allows almost all of the
        energy produced to be directly converted to high-grade
        electrical power! You might think that if nuclear energy is so
        cheap, efficiency would not be a problem. For power plants,
        particularly large ones, waste heat release can cause local
        environmental changes, either by heating a body of cooling
        water, or causing local weather changes when watermist cooling
        towers are used. The cooling apparatus is generally massive, and
        can easily cost more than the actual power-generating equipment!
      </p>
      <p>Waste heat in spacecraft is even more serious. Any
        nuclear-electric powerplant using gas turbines or similar
        equipment must get rid of the excess heat in order to operate.
        Since there is no air or water in space to conduct away the
        heat, it must be radiated. For a thermal-cycle reactor of
        sufficient power to operate even a modest manned spacecraft, the
        radiators will be on the order of the size of football fields.
        They end up being a huge portion of the dry mass of the
        spacecraft, and simply ruin the performance. Thus, a reactor
        that can produce electrical power directly, at 95% efficiency,
        has a tremendous performance advantage over its
        thermal/mechanical/electric counterpart. </p>
      <p>(By the way, you have seen heat radiators on spacecraft in
        Analog artwork many times. Vincent Di Fate tells me that's what
        those "fins" are on the back of his sleek designs.) </p>
      <p>Dr. Bussard has done some preliminary design studies on
        spacecraft that could realistically be built around p-B11
        reactors. Most use a large and very powerful reactor of close to
        10 billion watts capacity. While fairly bulky, with a diameter
        of around 5 meters, the reactor is mostly empty vacuum, with
        only the magnetic-grid and a few electron and ion guns in it. It
        is thus exceptionally light for the power produced. Supporting
        cryogenic and power conversion equipment should also be
        practical space hardware, and not especially massive. </p>
      <p>Because the reactor produces no radioactive waste and only a
        trace of radiation, it will be safe to operate in the
        atmosphere. Using high-voltage electron beams to superheat gas,
        one could build either an air-breathing jet or a rocket (relying
        on on-board reaction mass). In space, the rocket configuration
        will be used. Because the reactor can work only if there are far
        more electrons in it than fuel ions, it is also "intrinsically
        safe": if you feed it too much fuel, it just chokes off. </p>
      <p>There are many ways of exploiting the EXL reactor output to
        produce rocket thrust, but the fact that the lrB I powerplant
        produces high-voltage electricity makes it particularly suited
        for arc-jet propulsion's meaner big brother. In a
        million-volt-plus electron beam the electrons are pushing
        lightspeed, so the term relativistic electron beam (REB) is
        used. With some heavy-duty R&amp;D, it is expected that
        REB-heating can be made quite efficient, and should be able to
        impart high velocity to the reaction mass. Water would be a
        perfectly suitable reaction mass, as would almost any other
        handy and abundant material. REBs are not picky about what they
        blast to plasma. Dr Bussard calls the REB-heated systems "QED"
        (Quiet Electric Discharge) engines. </p>
      <p>For longer-range missions, where quick acceleration is less
        important, a more efficient rocket which uses the fusion exhaust
        directly could be built. This would be the system of choice for
        trips to the outer planets, or even out to the Oort cloud. Dr.
        Bussard calls these more efficient systems "DFP (Direct Fusion
        Product) engines. </p>
      <p>It would be possible to build a "singlestage-to-anywhere"
        (SSTA) rocket, useable in the atmosphere or in space, with this
        technology, but, for bulk transport, this would probably be less
        practical than having separate atmospheric shuttles (with
        wings), space transports (equipped for long voyages but stripped
        of wings and landing gear), and landers engineered for the
        various destinations. From a science fiction standpoint, though,
        the SSTA possibilities are really attractive. </p>
      <p>What kind of performance could realistically be achieved? Try
        these figures from some of Dr. Bussard's papers9,10,11! </p>
      <p>Low Earth Orbit (LEO) to Mars; 33 days, more or less, for high
        performance designs, or 6 weeks for economical freight-hauling
        variations. The craft are single-stage, with a 15-20% payload
        fraction. </p>
      <p>LEO to Saturn's Moons:as low as two months, with a short
        coasting period. Again, the craft is single-stage, and has a 14%
        payload fraction </p>
      <p>How would such a rocket affect the economics of space
        exploitation? Most estimates you have heard in the past were for
        multistaged chemically-propelled rockets, which can barely
        achieve Earth orbit, the upper stage of which must limp to the
        planets along painfully slow Hohmann ellipse orbits. Chemical
        rockets are almost all fuel and barely any payload. While rocket
        fuel is fairly cheap, rockets are not, and each flight has a
        high operating cost in labor and hardware. Dividing the cost of
        a large rocket by a payload mass somewhere just above zero gives
        a really depressing cost per kilogram. Efficient EXL fusion
        rockets, reusable for many flights, fast enough to make many
        flights before becoming obsolete, and with a high payload for
        each mission, can improve economics by several powers of ten.
        Consider the following colonization figures extracted from a
        more recent paper by Dr. Bussard,12 and I recommend you read
        these sitting down: </p>
      <p>Cost to LEO: $27/kg (a price that compares favorably to the
        cost of riding the Concorde across the Atlantic). </p>
      <p>4000 people on Earth's moon, each person with 25 metric tons of
        equipment, and each person receiving an annual visit back to
        Earth: $12 billion over ID years. </p>
      <p>1200 people on Mars, each with 50 tons of equipment, and an
        annual visit back to Earth: $16 billion over 10 years. </p>
      <p>400 people on Titan, each with 60 tons of equipment, and an
        annual visit back to Earth. $16 billion over 10 years. </p>
      <p>I leave you to ponder these figures, particularly in light of
        the projected costs of sending a few people to explore Mars with
        chemical rockets, typically estimated on the order of a hundred
        billion dollars per trip. In particular, consider what these
        numbers would mean to your personal chances of living and
        working in space. </p>

      <p>The biography of Philo Taylor Farnsworth II, the Utah farmboy
        who conceived the basic operating principles of electronic
        television at the age of 13 years. Despite his humble
        beginnings, this daring young dreamer persevered until his dream
        became reality, and his work touched the lives of every man,
        woman, and child alive today. Beginning with the first moment of
        inspiration -- while plowing a potato field in Rigby, Idaho --
        this book traces the unlikely chain of events that enabled
        Farnsworth to produce the first all electronic television
        picture in San Francisco on September 7, 1927. As television
        began to capture the worlds imagination in the 1950s,
        Farnsworth went on to pursue even more daring work. In the
        1960s he designed and built a device capable of producing
        nuclear fusion electronically -- a process that would have
        changed our world far more than television ever could! With this
        lovingly crafted volume, the late inventors wife provides an
        intimate, first-hand account of their lives together on the
        leading edge of discovery. </p>

      <p>Rediscover the legendary names of a suppressed scientific
        revolution -- remarkable lives, astounding discoveries, and
        incredible inventions which would have produced a world of
        wonder. How did the aura research of Baron Karl von Reichenbach
        prove the vitalistic theory and frighten the greatest minds of
        Germany? How did the physiophone and wireless of Antonio Meucci
        predate both Bell and Marconi by decades? How does the earth
        battery technology of Nathan Stubblefield portend an unsuspected
        energy revolution? How did the geotheric engines of Nikola
        Tesla threaten the establishment of a fuel-dependent America?
        The microscopes and virus-destroying ray machines of Dr. Royal
        Rife provided the solution for every world-threatening disease.
        Why did the FDA and AMA together condemn this great man to
        Federal Prison? The static crashes heard on telephone lines
        enabled Dr. Moray to discover the reality of radiant space
        energy. Was the mysterious "Swedish stone", the powerful mineral
        which T. Henry Moray discovered, the very first historical
        instance in which stellar power was recognized and secured on
        earth? Why did the Air Force initially fund the gravitational
        warp research and warp-cloaking devices of T. T. Brown, and then
        reject it? <b>When the controlled fusion devices of Philo
          Farnsworth achieved the "break-even" point in 1967, the FUSOR
          project was abruptly cancelled by ITT.</b> What were the
        twisted intrigues which surrounded these deliberate convolutions
        of history? Each chapter is a biographic treasure. Ours is a
        world living hundreds of years behind its intended stage of
        development. Only a complete knowledge of this loss is the key
        to recapturing this wonder technology. <br>
