        <div align="left"> For ages, people have been trying to find
          ways to suppress or hide their wrinkles, which is a natural
          phenomenon in humans due to old age. An anti-aging chocolate
          may soon come to the rescue of many who want to look 30 years
          younger.<br>
          <br>
          Spas and retail stores in the UK are expected to get the first
          wrinkle removing chocolate in March. A Cambridge-based firm
          Lycotec has developed the anti-aging chocolate called
          Esthechoc, also known as Cambridge Beauty Chocolate.<br>
          <br>
          The creators of the chocolate reveal that Esthechoc contains
          about 70 percent cocoa dark chocolate and is rich in
          antioxidants: astaxanthin and cocoa flavanols. The chocolate
          maker suggests that a small portion of the chocolate weighing
          just 7.5 grams can deliver the equivalent amount of flavanols
          to 100 grams of dark chocolate and of astaxanthin to 300 grams
          of wild Alaskan salmon.<br>
          <br>
          Lycotec also reveals that the potency of the chocolate has
          also been demonstrated in large clinical trials.<br>
          <br>
          "After three to four weeks of daily intake by 50 to
          60-year-old volunteers, the Beauty Chocolate was able to not
          only suppress markers of sub-clinical inflammatory damage in
          their blood, but also reverse their age-related depression of
          microcirculation and blood supply to such peripheral tissues
          as subcutaneous fat and skin," stated Lycotec.<br>
          <br>
          Dr. Ivan Petyaev, director of Lycotec and the inventor of the
          technology behind Esthechoc, revealed that clinical trials
          were conducted on over 3,000 participants between 50 and 60
          years old. The findings of the research revealed that the
          biomarkers of the participant's skin were bought back to those
          of a 20 or 30-year-old person.<br>
          <br>
          Dr. Petyaev said that it took several years to research the
          anti-aging product and it will soon be and it will soon be
          available on the market. In 2014, Lycotec entered a licensing
          agreement with a company aiming to commercialize the product.<br>
          <br>
          The company also claims that consuming one bar of Esthechoc
          each day is safe even for diabetic and calorie-conscious
          people. Esthechoc is said to come in packs of 21 bars, which a
          person should eat over three weeks. The retail price of the
          chocolate remains unknown.<br>
          <br>
          Some market observers, however, believe that the company
          should conduct further studies before making strong claims
          about Esthechoc.<br>

        </div>
        <div align="left"><br>
          The invention is concerned with food products comprising one
          or more cocoa bean products and a carotenoid compound,
          particularly with food products which are, or comprise,
          chocolate. The products of the invention may be used in
          reducing elevated total cholesterol, triglycerides and
          inflammatory damage, as well as improving tissue
          microcirculation and tissue oxygenation.<br>
          <br>
          <b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
          <br>
          [0001] This invention relates to cocoa-based food products,
          such as chocolate, which have beneficial effects on parameters
          of metabolism in individuals including levels of
          triglycerides, cholesterol and other lipids, molecular oxygen
          transport and its metabolism, oxygen tissue saturation and
          microcirculation, control of hypoxia/ischaemia, as well as
          markers of inflammation and inflammatory oxidative damage.<br>
          <br>
          <b>BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION</b><br>
          <br>
          [0002] Food products based on cocoa beans, such as chocolate
          and other products containing cocoa solids, cocoa butter,
          cocoa liquor, and/or their derivatives, are widespread in the
          Western society. Although these cocoa-based products often
          contain flavonols and flavonoids, which have been associated
          with certain health benefits, they also contain high levels of
          cocoa butter or other high-fat ingredients. This high fat
          content means that cocoa-based food products are one of the
          dietary factors responsible for the growth of Metabolic
          Syndrome, Diabetes II and Obesity in the modern society.<br>
          <br>
          [0003] Cocoa-based food products, such as chocolate, have been
          associated with health benefits, such as improvements in
          endothelial vascular function, including positive effects on
          blood pressure, and with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory
          properties [Keen et al Am J Clin. Nutr. 2005, 81(suppl):
          298S-303S].<br>
          <br>
          [0004] However, the effects of chocolate on blood lipid
          concentrations are either inconclusive or negative.
          Consumption of 105 g of dark chocolate has been reported to
          result in a mild reduction of total blood lipid concentrations
          of 11% [Cesar et al Clinical &amp; Developmental Immunology,
          2005; 12(1) 11-17], but this trial was done on an exceptional
          group of young elite sportsmen and positive blood lipid
          changes may be attributed to the overall improvement of their
          physical performance.<br>
          <br>
          [0005] Meta-analysis of eight clinical trials on dark
          chocolate or cocoa powder showed an observed reduction in the
          cholesterol levels of up to 5.82 mg/dL, which was
          statistically insignificant [Lei et al Am J Nutr 2010; 92;
          218-25]. Furthermore, the amount of the daily administered
          doses of cocoa phenols in these trials was equivalent of
          consumption of 100 g or more of the dark chocolate [Cheng et
          al Molecules 2009, 14: 200-209]. In other studies, when dark
          chocolate was consumed from 30 to 100 g daily, no changes were
          observed in the blood lipids [Taubert et al JAMA. 2007; 4,
          298(1):49-60, Grassi et al Hypertension. 2005; 46(2):398-405].<br>
          <br>
          [0006] The level of triglycerides in all the above studies
          above either had insignificant trends or did not change at
          all.<br>
          <br>
          [0007] There are no reports of any health benefit, including
          on blood lipids, arising from consumption of the most common
          forms of chocolate, including milk chocolate and white
          chocolate.<br>
          <br>
          [0008] Lycopene is known to be as a potent antioxidant. Its
          mild cholesterol-lowering effect has been reported from 13
          clinical studies and was 7.55+6.15 mg/dL [Ried et: al
          Maturitas. 2011, 68(4):299-310]. However this effect was only
          observed for daily doses 25 mg of lycopene or above. There
          were no reports on the effect of lycopene on elevated
          triglycerides in human.<br>
          <br>
          [0009] Although 25 mg of lycopene and above is considered to
          be safe for certain periods of administration, it is far above
          the daily level which could be consumed with a diet rich with
          tomato or tomato processed products (about 6-10 mg). Daily
          consumption of 6-10 mg lycopene has been reported to have no
          effect on cholesterol or other blood lipids [Bose et al
          Singapore Med J 2007; 48 (5); 415-420; Upritchard et al
          Diabetes Care, 2000, 236: 733-735]<br>
          <br>
          <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          [0010] The present invention is based on the unexpected
          finding that the combination of a carotenoid and a cocoa bean
          product can be used to reduced elevated cholesterol, reduce
          elevated triglyceride levels, reduce inflammatory oxidative
          damage and improve tissue microcirculation and oxygen
          transport. Given the high fat and sugar content of chocolate,
          such a finding was highly unexpected and indeed
          counterintuitive.<br>
          <br>
          [0011] Accordingly, the invention provides a food product
          comprising one or more cocoa bean products and a carotenoid
          compound.<br>

          <br>
          <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION THE INVENTION</b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          [0029] This invention relates to the unexpected finding that
          incorporating carotenoid compounds into food products which
          contain cocoa-bean based products, such as cocoa solids, cocoa
          butter, cocoa liquor, and/or their derivatives, causes these
          food products to exert a positive effect on levels of
          triglycerides, cholesterol, LDL, and other metabolic
          parameters in individuals, despite being rich in saturated and
          unsaturated fats. Given the high fat content of food products
          such as chocolate, the finding that the combination of a
          carotenoid and chocolate is able to reduce those parameters
          was unexpected and counter-intuitive.<br>
          <br>
          [0030] An aspect of the invention provides a food product
          which comprises one or more cocoa-bean products and a
          carotenoid compound. Typically, the carotenoid compound is an
          isolated carotenoid compound.<br>
          <br>
          [0031] The food product may comprise a homogenous matrix which
          contains the cocoa-bean products and the carotenoid compound.
          For example, the cocoa-bean products and carotenoid compound
          may be blended together in a chocolate or cocoa-butter matrix.<br>
          <br>
          [0032] A cocoa bean product is an extract, fraction or isolate
          from cocoa beans (i.e. beans of the cacao tree (Theobroma
          cacao)). Suitable cocoa bean products are well-known in the
          art and include cocoa solid, cocoa liquor and/or cocoa butter.
          For example, a food product may comprise one or more of cocoa
          solid, cocoa liquor and/or cocoa butter.<br>
          <br>
          [0033] In some instances cocoa nibs or fragments thereof,
          chocolate liquor, partially and fully-defatted cocoa solids
          (e.g. cocoa powder), cocoa extract or a fraction thereof may
          be employed.<br>
          <br>
          [0034] Cocoa solid (also known as cocoa powder) is a low-fat
          extract of cocoa beans, which contains flavanols, flavanoids,
          caffeine and theobromine. Cocoa solid may be produced by
          removing the fat component (cocoa butter) from the cocoa bean
          and grinding the remaining material, excluding the shell, to a
          powder using techniques which are well-known in the art, such
          as Broma processing. In some embodiments, cocoa powder may be
          treated with an alkaline substance such as potassium carbonate
          to reduce acidity and darken the colour (Dutch processing).<br>
          <br>
          [0035] Cocoa butter is a high-fat extract of cocoa beans which
          is high in stearic acid, palmitic acid and other saturated
          fats. Cocoa butter may be produced from whole or ground cocoa
          beans using techniques which are well-known in the art.<br>
          <br>
          [0036] Cocoa liquor is a cocoa bean extract which contains
          both cocoa solid and cocoa butter. Cocoa liquor may be
          produced by grinding and melting the cocoa bean nib (centre)
          to a smooth liquid state in accordance with techniques which
          are well-known in the art. Chocolate liquor does not contain
          non-cocoa vegetable fat and may also be referred to as
          “chocolate”, “unsweetened chocolate”, “baking chocolate”, or
          “bitter chocolate”.<br>
          <br>
          [0037] In other embodiments, cocoa bean products may include
          derivatives or fermentation products of cocoa bean extracts,
          isolates or fractions.<br>
          <br>
          [0038] Preferably, the food product comprises cocoa butter;
          cocoa solid; or both cocoa butter and cocoa solid.<br>
          <br>
          [0039] For example the food product may contain at least 1% by
          weight, at least 10% by weight, at least 15% by weight, at
          least 20% by weight, at least 25% by weight or at least 30%,
          or at least 40% by weight cocoa butter. The food product may
          contain an amount of cocoa butter in a range comprising any of
          the above two values as endpoints.<br>
          <br>
          [0040] In some embodiments, a food product may further
          comprise non-cocoa fats, such as vegetable or animal fats in
          addition to cocoa butter.<br>
          <br>
          [0041] In some embodiments, a food product may be devoid of
          cocoa butter. For example, a food product may contain animal
          or non-cocoa vegetable fat instead of cocoa butter. Non-cocoa
          vegetable fats may include vegetable oils. Suitable vegetable
          oils, such as palm oil, soybean oil rapeseed oil and olive
          oil, are well known in the art.<br>
          <br>
          [0042] The total fat content of a food product described
          herein may be at least 10% by dry weight, at least 15% by dry
          weight, at least 20% by dry weight, at least 25% by dry
          weight, at least 30% by dry weight or at least 35% by dry
          weight or at least 40% by dry weight. The fat content may be,
          for instance, in a range comprising any two such values as
          endpoints.<br>
          <br>
          [0043] Additionally or alternatively, the food product may
          contain at least 5% by weight, at least 15% by weight, at
          least 20% by weight, at least 25% by weight, at least 30% by
          dry weight or at least 35% by weight, or at least 40% by
          weight dry cocoa solid. In some instances, the amount of cocoa
          solid may be at least 50% by weight, at least 60% by weight,
          at least 75% by weight, at least 80% by weight, at least 85%
          by weight, at least 90% by weight or even at least 95% by
          weight dry cocoa solid, particularly when the food stuff is a
          dark chocolate. The amount of weight of dry cocoa solid may
          be, for instance, in the range comprising any two of those
          values as endpoints.<br>
          <br>
          [0044] In some embodiments, a food product may be devoid of
          cocoa solid.<br>
          <br>
          [0045] For the avoidance of doubt, aspects of the invention
          provide food products which comprise all combinations of the
          above parameters of cocoa solid, cocoa butter and total fat.<br>
          <br>
          [0046] In some embodiments, the cocoa bean products may form a
          chocolate matrix. The carotenoid compound may be incorporated
          into the chocolate matrix by blending or admixing.<br>
          <br>
          [0047] Any cocoa-based food product may be supplemented with a
          carotenoid compound as described herein. For example, the food
          product may be a foodstuff, a beverage or a dietary supplement
          or nutraceutical product.<br>
          <br>
          [0048] Foodstuff products include bread, flour, cereal,
          biscuit, pastry, dairy products, such as cheese spread,
          cheese, cream and yoghurt, fillings, pastes, sauces and
          mousses. Other suitable foodstuffs are well known in the art.<br>
          <br>
          [0049] In some preferred embodiments, foodstuff products may
          include confectionery products, such as chocolate. Especially
          preferred embodiments of the invention provide chocolate
          comprising a carotenoid compound, as described herein.<br>
          <br>
          [0050] Chocolate may include dark chocolate, milk chocolate,
          or white chocolate.<br>
          <br>
          [0051] In one preferred instance, the foodstuff of the
          invention may be a chocolate bar, for instance a dark, plain
          or milk chocolate bar comprising a carotenoid, such as any of
          those discussed herein. The amount of carotenoid in the bar
          may be, for instance, any of the amounts of carotenoid
          specified herein.<br>
          <br>
          [0052] Dark chocolate, milk chocolate and white chocolate are
          subject to defined identity standards (for example, by the
          Food and Drug Administration (USA), EU and Food Standards
          Agency (UK); see for example EU directive 2000/36/EC; FDA 21
          CFR Part 163 Federal Register: 2002 67 193 62171-62178). In
          one instance, a composition of the invention may be a standard
          of identity (SOI) chocolate, in others it is a non-SOI
          chocolate.<br>
          <br>
          [0053] The ingredients of dark chocolate, milk chocolate,
          white chocolate or other forms of chocolate are well-known in
          the art. For example, dark chocolate typically comprises
          sugar, cocoa butter (e.g. at least 12% by weight), cocoa
          solids (e.g. at least 35% by weight), and optionally vanilla.
          Fat content may vary but averages between 30%-35%. Dark
          chocolate is sometimes referred to as sweet or semisweet
          chocolate. Milk chocolate may comprise sugar, cocoa butter,
          cocoa solids, vanilla or other flavourings, and milk, milk
          powder or cream. Milk chocolate typically contains at least
          20% cocoa solid and at least 12% milk solids by weight. White
          chocolate may comprise sugar, cocoa butter, milk or milk
          powder, and vanilla and lacks cocoa solids. White chocolate
          typically contains at least 20% cocoa butter, 14% total milk
          solids, and less than 55% sugar.<br>
          <br>
          [0054] In one instance, the food product of the invention may
          be about 100 g, 150 g, 200 g, 250 g, 300 g, 400 g or 500 g in
          weight or may have a weight in a range with any two of those
          values as endpoints. In a preferred instance, the foodstuff
          may be a chocolate bar of such weight.<br>
          <br>
          [0055] The foodstuff may be a candy bar, for instance a
          chocolate coated candy bar. The foodstuff may take the form of
          individual chocolates, bagged chocolates or a box of
          chocolates. The chocolate may be in a formed shape. In one
          instance the foodstuff is an Easter egg. The invention may be
          provided in the form of chocolate icing or a cake comprising a
          carotenoid and chocolate. The invention also provides fruit or
          nuts coated with a chocolate of the invention. The invention
          also provides sweets or candy coated with a chocolate of the
          invention.<br>
          <br>
          [0056] The invention also provides a chocolate of the
          invention provided in the form of a single serving dose, for
          instance in 10 to 30 g amounts, as well as a packet of such
          single serving doses. The invention also provides a chocolate
          bar of the invention segmented, for instance segmented so that
          it can be broken into single serving dosages.<br>
          <br>
          [0057] The foodstuff of the invention may be, in other
          instances, a cake, cheesecake, baked snack, brownie, cookie or
          biscuit, a meal replacement bar, a rice cake, ice cream or
          other pudding or dessert. In some instances, the invention
          provides such products coated in, or comprising, a chocolate
          of the invention. The products may for instance comprise the
          chocolate in the form of chips or in a central region.<br>
          <br>
          [0058] Beverages may include any drink which comprises
          cocoa-bean products and may include cocoa, drinking chocolate,
          milk shakes, and other dairy and non-dairy drinks. Beverages
          may be non-alcoholic or alcoholic. The formulation of suitable
          beverages is well-known in the art. In one preferred instance,
          the beverage is a chocolate milkshake. In another instance, a
          powder, gel or cube for making up as a beverage is also
          provided. The invention also provides a hot chocolate,
          chocolate or cocoa drink, as well as a chocolate/cocoa shot
          drink comprising a product of the invention.<br>
          <br>
          [0059] Dietary supplements or nutraceutical products may be in
          any form suitable for oral administration (e.g., by ingestion)
          and may be presented as discrete units such as capsules,
          cachets or tablets; as a powder or granules; as a solution or
          suspension in an aqueous or non-aqueous liquid; or as an
          oil-in-water liquid emulsion or a water-in-oil liquid
          emulsion; as a bolus; as an electuary; or as a paste.<br>
          <br>
          [0060] The invention also provides a food-stuff intended for
          dieters which is, or comprises, a foodstuff of the invention.
          The invention provides for the use of the products described
          herein for slimming, dieting or weight reduction. The
          invention also provides for products for diabetics comprising,
          or consisting of, a foodstuff of the invention. In one
          instance, the invention provides a diabetic chocolate, where
          the chocolate is a chocolate of the invention.<br>
          <br>
          [0061] In one preferred instance, a foodstuff of the invention
          may be provided with packaging and/or wrapping. Such
          packaging/wrapping may indicate the benefits of the invention
          and/or suggest consumption at, or near, mealtimes for maximal
          benefit. The packaging/wrapping may indicate the benefits of
          the product in slimming, decreasing cholesterol, and/or
          triglyceride levels. In another instance, the packaging may
          refer to the ability of the product to improve oxygen
          transport. The packaging may refer to treating or ameliorating
          any of the conditions mentioned herein. The packaging may be a
          sachet, for instance where the product is to be made up as a
          beverage.<br>
          <br>
          [0062] The invention also provides food products targeted at
          sports people. For instance, the products may be used to
          reduce weight in such subjects or bring about any of the other
          benefits highlighted herein for the products of the invention.
          The products may be packaged or wrapped and include an
          indication of their ability to increase oxygen transport. The
          products of the invention may be used to reduce recovery time.
          The products may be used by climbers, particularly those
          climbing at altitude.<br>
          <br>
          [0063] In addition to cocoa-bean products, food products
          described herein comprise a carotenoid compound.<br>
          <br>
          [0064] The carotenoid compound may be isolated in the products
          of the invention. An isolated carotenoid compound is outside
          the physical milieu or environment in which it occurs in
          nature. For example, an isolated carotenoid compound may be
          free or substantially free from its natural environment e.g.
          it is not contained in the natural plant material with which
          it is naturally associated. Isolated carotenoid compounds
          include compounds which have been isolated, concentrated,
          purified or partially purified from natural sources, such as
          plants, and compounds which have been produced synthetically.<br>
          <br>
          [0065] The food product will typically provide an effective
          amount of carotenoid, such as lycopene. The food product may
          comprise 0.0001% to 1%; 0.001% to 1%; or 0.01% to 0.1% by
          weight of carotenoid compound. For example, the food product
          may comprise 0.001 to 10 mg of carotenoid compound per one
          gram of food product, for example, 0.01 to 10 mg per gram or
          0.1 to 1 mg per one gram of food product. The product of the
          invention will typically provide an effective amount of the
          carotenoid, for instance an amount effective to alter one of
          the parameters referred to herein.<br>
          <br>
          [0066] The food product may be in a unit dose form which
          allows a controlled daily dose of carotenoid, preferably
          lycopene, to be consumed. For example, the food product may be
          formulated to provide a daily dose of 0.1 mg to 100 mg of
          lycopene, preferably 0.5 to 50 mg of lycopene. In some
          instances, a product of the invention may provide about 0.1
          mg, 0.2 mg, 0.5 mg, 1 mg, 1.5 mg, 2 mg, 2.5 mg or more of
          carotenoid, such as about 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 mg of
          carotenoid. In some instances, the amount of carotenoid may be
          about 10, 15, 20 or 25 mg, or up to those levels. Preferably
          the carotenoid is lycopene. The product may comprise an amount
          of carotenoid which is in a range with any two of the values
          mentioned herein as endpoints.<br>
          <br>
          [0067] In one instance, the foodstuff or product provides from
          0.1 to 1.0 mg of carotenoid per gram of food product for
          example at least 0.2, 0.3, 0.4 or 0.5 mg carotenoid per gram
          of food product, with in some instances, up to 0.3, 0.4, 0.5,
          0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9 or 1.0 mg of carotenoid per gram of
          product. In one preferred instance, those values are employed
          where the product is chocolate and/or carotenoid is lycopene,
          preferably both. In another instance, the level of foodstuff
          administered is enough to reduce any of the makers discussed
          herein, preferably to near, or at, or below baseline levels
          for a healthy control or below baseline prior to
          administration of the product.<br>
          <br>
          [0068] In some instances, the ratio of carotenoid to
          triglyceride or other fat molecules in the products of the
          invention may be from 1:1000 to 1:100,000, for instance from
          1:2000 to 1:50,000, or from 1:5000 to 1:25,000.<br>
          <br>
          [0069] The carotenoid and cocoa bean product may be present in
          a synergistic amount. For instance, they may be present where
          the combination produces a greater effect on any of the
          parameters mentioned herein than either individually when
          provided in the same amount. The invention therefore also
          provides a synergistic combination of a carotenoid and cocoa
          bean product. The invention also provides for the use of a
          carotenoid, such as any of those referred to herein, to treat
          any of the conditions mentioned herein, where the subject is
          also being administered chocolate and also the use of
          chocolate to treat any of the conditions mentioned herein
          where the subject is also being administered a carotenoid.
          Typically the carotenoid and chocolate will be administered
          together, for instance eaten together, or within 5, 10, 15,
          30, 45 or 60 minutes of each other. The two may be given
          simultaneously.<br>
          <br>
          [0070] Carotenoid compounds are tetraterpenoids which contain
          long polyene chains. Carotenoid compounds include xanthophylls
          such as lutein, capsanthin and zeaxanthin, and carotenes, such
          as beta-carotene, alpha-carotene, zeto-carotene, and lycopene
          compounds.<br>
          <br>
          [0071] Lycopene compounds may include lycopene,
          1-HO-3',4'-didehydrolycopene, 3,1'-(HO)2-gamma-carotene,
          1,1'-(HO)2-3,4,3',4'-tetradehydrolycopene, 1,1'-(HO)2-3,
          4-didehydrolycopene.<br>
          <br>
          [0072] In preferred embodiments, the carotenoid compound is
          lycopene.<br>
          <br>
          [0073] Lycopene is an open-chain unsaturated C40 carotenoid of
          structure I (Chemical Abstracts Service Registry Number
          502-65-8),<br>
          <br>
          [0000]<br>
          &lt;img class="EMIRef" id="225182734-EMI-C00001" /&gt;<br>
          <br>
          [0074] Lycopene occurs naturally in plants such as tomatoes,
          guava, rosehip, watermelon and pink grapefruit and any such
          sources of lycopene may be, for instance, employed.<br>
          <br>
          [0075] Lycopene for use as described herein may comprise one
          or more different isomers. For example, lycopene may include
          cis-lycopene isomers, trans-lycopene isomers and mixtures of
          the cis- and trans-isomers. Lycopene may comprise at least
          10%, at least 20%, at least 30%, at least 40%, at least 50%,
          at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80%, at least 90%, or at
          least 95% (Z)-isomers, (all-E)-isomers, or cis-isomers, such
          as 5-cis- or 9-cis- or 13-cis-isomers, which have improved
          bioavailability relative to trans isomers. Trans isomers may
          isomerise into cis forms in vivo, or during storage and
          processing.<br>
          <br>
          [0076] Carotenoid compounds, such as lycopene, for use as
          described herein may be natural i.e. obtained from a natural
          source, for example, extracted from a plant, such as a tomato
          or melon. In one instance, oleoresin, particularly tomato
          oleoresin, may be employed in the invention. A range of
          methods for extracting, concentrating and/or purifying
          carotenoids from plants are known in the art. For example,
          solvent extraction using ethanol, DMSO, ethyl acetate, hexane,
          acetone, soya or other vegetable oil, or non-vegetable oils
          may be employed.<br>
          <br>
          [0077] Carotenoid compounds, such as lycopene, for use as
          described herein may be synthetic i.e. produced by artificial
          means, for example, by chemical synthesis. A range of methods
          for chemical synthesis of lycopene and other carotenoids are
          known in the art.<br>
          <br>
          [0078] For example, a three-stage chemical synthesis based on
          the standard Wittig olefination reaction scheme for carotenoid
          synthesis may be employed, in which an organic solution of C15
          phosphonium methanesulfonate in dichloromethane (DCM) and an
          organic solution of C10 dialdehyde in toluene are produced,
          and the two organic solutions are gradually combined with
          sodium methoxide solution and undergo a condensation reaction
          to form crude lycopene. The crude lycopene may then be
          purified using routine techniques, for example by adding
          glacial acetic acid and deionized water to the mixture,
          stirring vigorously, allowing the aqueous and organic phases
          to separate, and extracting the organic phase containing DCM
          and crude lycopene with water. Methanol is added to the
          organic phase and the DCM removed via distillation under
          reduced pressure. The crude methanolic lycopene solution is
          then be heated and cooled to crystalline slurry that is
          filtered and washed with methanol. The lycopene crystals may
          then be recrystallized and dried under heated nitrogen.
          Synthetic carotenoids, such as lycopene, are also available
          from commercial suppliers (e.g. BASF Corp, NJ USA).<br>
          <br>
          [0079] Synthetic carotenoid compounds, such as lycopene, may
          comprise an increased proportion of cis isomers relative to
          natural carotenoid compounds. For example, synthetic lycopene
          may be up to 25% 5-cis, 1% 9-cis, 1% 13-cis, and 3% other cis
          isomers, whilst lycopene produced by tomatoes may be 3-5%
          5-cis, 0-1% 9-cis, 1% 13-cis, and &lt;1% other cis isomers.
          Since cis-lycopene has increased bioavailability relative to
          trans-lycopene, synthetic lycopene is preferred in some
          embodiments.<br>
          <br>
          [0080] Derivatives of carotenoids as described above may be
          produced by chemical synthesis analogous to the synthesis
          described above or by chemical modification of natural
          carotenoids extracted from plant material.<br>
          <br>
          [0081] A food product as described herein may contain a single
          carotenoid compound. (e.g. lycopene) or more than one
          carotenoid compound (e.g. lycopene and beta-carotene).
          Typically, each carotenoid compound will be present in a range
          of different isomeric forms.<br>
          <br>
          [0082] The food product may be produced by admixing or
          blending the cocoa-bean products, such as cocoa butter and
          cocoa solids, and optionally one or more other ingredients,
          and the carotenoid compound under conditions which allow the
          carotenoid compound to incorporate into the matrix of the food
          product.<br>
          <br>
          [0083] Other ingredients may include sugar, vanilla, milk,
          milk powder, emulsifying agents, such as soy lecithin or
          polyglycerol polyricinoleate (PGPR; E476), whey or potato
          peptides and/or proteins, soy products, such as soy proteins,
          soy extracts and/or soy isoflavones, vegetable oils or animal
          fats, nut-based products, such as nut powders and nut extract,
          starch and polysaccharides.<br>
          <br>
          [0084] The cocoa-bean products may be in a dry, liquid,
          aerosol, frozen or melted form for admixing or blending with
          the carotenoid compound. For example, chocolate for blending
          may be in liquid form (i.e. melted chocolate).<br>
          <br>
          [0085] In some preferred embodiments, the cocoa-bean products
          and the carotenoid compound in mixable forms and have the same
          or similar viscosities.<br>
          <br>
          [0086] Suitable methods of mixing and blending, including
          mechanical blending, are well-known in the art.<br>
          <br>
          [0087] In one instance, a carotenoid is added whilst the
          chocolate is being made or chocolate is melted and the
          carotenoid added. The chocolate may be added to a mould to
          give products of a particular shape and/or size.<br>
          <br>
          [0088] The invention also provides for a method of producing a
          food product, such as a food product of the invention, which
          comprises adding a carotenoid during production of the food
          product. For instance, the carotenoid may be added during the
          preparation of chocolate.<br>
          <br>
          [0089] Products of the invention may also contain other
          ingredients such as flavourings, emulsifiers, colourings
          and/or preservatives. In some cases the products may comprise
          nuts, particularly where the product is a chocolate, such as
          walnuts, hazelnuts, almonds or brazil nuts.<br>
          <br>
          [0090] Food products as described herein are shown to have an
          unexpected effect on levels of blood cholesterol, low density
          lipoprotein, triglycerides and/or other lipids or lipid
          particles, such as LDL particles, in an individual. Given
          chocolate is perceived as a high fat food, that was
          unexpected.<br>
          <br>
          [0091] Aspects of the invention provide a food product as
          described above for use in reducing blood levels of
          cholesterol, low density lipoprotein, triglycerides and/or
          other lipids or lipid particles, such as LDL particles, in an
          individual and a method of reducing blood levels of
          cholesterol, low density lipoprotein, triglycerides and/or
          other lipids or lipid particles, such as LDL particles, in an
          individual comprising administering a food product described
          above to the individual.<br>
          <br>
          [0092] Another aspect of the invention provides the use of a
          carotenoid compound and one or more cocoa bean products, as
          described above, in the manufacture of a food product for use
          in reducing blood levels of cholesterol, low density
          lipoprotein, triglycerides and/or other lipids or lipid
          particles, such as LDL particles, in an individual.<br>
          <br>
          [0093] This may be useful in the treatment or prevention of
          cardio- and cerebro-vascular disorders, or Metabolic Syndrome,
          high blood pressure, pre-diabetes and type II diabetes, being
          overweight (e.g. BMI&gt;25), obesity (e.g. BMI&gt;30) and
          hypercholesterolaemia. The invention may be employed, for
          instance, with any of those subjects. The products of the
          invention may be used in dieting.<br>
          <br>
          [0094] The invention also provides a method of dieting
          comprising consuming a product of the invention as part of the
          diet.<br>
          <br>
          [0095] An individual is preferably a human, though use in
          animals is also possible. The individual may have normal blood
          levels of cholesterol, LDL and/or triglycerides or elevated
          blood levels of cholesterol, LDL and/or triglycerides. In some
          instances, the subject may have a total serum cholesterol of
          more than 200 mg/dL, for instance more than 210 mg/dL. In some
          cases a subject may additionally, or alternatively have,
          triglyceride levels above 150 mg/dL. In some cases, the
          subject may be apparently healthy, but be identified as having
          such elevated levels of cholesterol and/or triglycerides, in
          other instances the subject may have a history of heart
          disease and/or atherosclerosis. The subject may be overweight
          and may be obese. The subject may be one taking statins,
          aspirin and/or blood pressure reducing medication. The subject
          may be one on a diet.<br>
          <br>
          [0096] Methods of measuring levels of cholesterol, LDL,
          triglycerides and other lipids in an individual are well-known
          in the art.<br>
          <br>
          [0097] In some embodiments, the individual may be at suffering
          from, or at risk of suffering from, a cardio- or
          cerebro-vascular disorders, such as coronary heart disease,
          metabolic syndrome, high blood pressure, pre-diabetes and type
          II diabetes, being overweight (e.g. BMI&gt;25) or obesity
          (e.g. BMI&gt;30). The subject may have had a heart attack. The
          subject may have had a stoke.<br>
          <br>
          [0098] Food products as described herein are also shown to
          reduce levels of markers of inflammatory oxidative damage in
          an individual. In some cases the subject may have elevated
          levels of inflammatory oxidative damage. For instance, they
          may have ?20-39 µM MDA and/or at least 0.25 to 0.30 u/ml of
          Px-IgG Such levels may be in addition to, or alternative to,
          the above specified levels of total cholesterol and/or
          triglycerides.<br>
          <br>
          [0099] The food products may therefore also be useful in
          reducing inflammation; reducing anti-inflammatory oxidative
          damage; increasing antioxidant activity and/or reducing or
          delaying symptoms of aging in an individual. The invention may
          be used to reduce the visible signs of aging.<br>
          <br>
          [0100] Examples of possible daily doses of 0.1 mg to 100 mg of
          carotenoid compound, such as lycopene, preferably 0.5 to 50
          mg, may be administered to the individual. Any of the amounts
          referred to herein may be administered.<br>
          <br>
          [0101] In some embodiments, a suitable individual may be a
          mature or elderly individual, for example at least 50, 60, 65,
          70, 75 or more years old or be of an age in the range defined
          by any of those two values.<br>
          <br>
          [0102] Food products as described herein may also be useful in
          providing nutrition to an individual.<br>
          <br>
          [0103] For example, food products may be useful as sports
          nutrition products or in providing nutrition to mature or
          elderly individuals (e.g. &gt;50 years old) or individuals
          undergoing body mass control or reduction, i.e. for “slimming”
          purposes.<br>
          <br>
          [0104] In other examples, food products may be useful in
          providing nutrition to individual having or recovering from a
          clinical condition. For example, food products described
          herein may be useful in the nutrition of an individual
          recovering from injury, operation, or trauma; an individual
          having or recovering from chemo- or radio-therapy; or an
          individual having or at risk of Metabolic Syndrome, obesity,
          diabetes II, atherosclerosis and their clinical complications.<br>
          <br>
          [0105] The invention may be used to help treat ischemia or
          hypoxia. The invention may be, in some instances, administered
          after blood flow has been cut off to a particular tissue or
          organ. In one instance, the invention may be administered to
          subjects who have had a stroke.<br>
          <br>
          [0106] Food products as described herein may also be useful in
          the treatment or prevention of cardio- and cerebro-vascular
          disorders, hypertension, metabolic syndrome, high blood
          pressure, pre-diabetes and type II diabetes, being overweight
          (e.g. BMI&gt;25), obesity (e.g. BMI&gt;30) or other medical
          conditions such as anaemia, rheumatism, rheumatoid arthritis,
          non-rheumatoid arthritis, prostate or testes malfunctions,
          erectile dysfunctions, loss of libido, cellulite, sarcopenia
          and cachexia.<br>
          <br>
          [0107] In some instances, the subject the invention is applied
          to may have an auto-immune disease; an allergic condition;
          hypertension; atherosclerosis; cardio pathologies, such as
          Coronary Heart Disease; vascular pathologies, such as
          endocarditis, myocarditis, heart failure, heart valve disease,
          arrhythmias, atherosclerosis, hypertension, vasculitis,
          endarteritis, varicose veins, endophlebitis, endothelial
          damage; cerebral pathologies; obesity; diabetes type 2;
          cancer, sarcopenia; metabolic dysfunction; Metabolic Syndrome;
          cellulite and aging tissue degradation; gastritis; stomach or
          duodenum ulcers; or arthritis; or dermatitis, psoriasis, acne,
          chronic skin ulcerations, or other age-related or not skin
          conditions, including skin and other tissues burns and wounds;
          sport, trauma, operation and other injuries; cachexia,
          side-effects of chemotherapies and radiation treatment, or
          radiation exposure; the subject may be at risk of such a
          condition.<br>
          <br>
          [0108] Due to the ability of the invention to increase oxygen
          transport, the invention may also be used to treat conditions
          where such increased oxygen transport may be beneficial. For
          instance, a subject with a respiratory disorder such as
          emphysema, COPD, cystic fibrosis, asthma, or ARDS. The subject
          may have reduced lung function, for instance due to lung
          damage or lung cancer. In one instance, the subject may be a
          smoker.<br>
          <br>
          [0109] The invention may also be used to treat impairment of
          tissue oxygenation, for instance due to reduction of blood
          supply due to circulatory dysfunction or circulatory disease.
          The subject may have had an injury, disease or disorder
          causing reduced blood flow, for instance one that results from
          blood flow to an organ and/or tissue being reduced or cut-off.<br>
          <br>
          [0110] The invention may be used to increase tissue
          oxygenation and treat circulatory disease. In one instance the
          circulatory disorder may be due to traumatic, compressive,
          occlusive, tumors/malformations and/or vasospastic reduction
          in oxygenation. The subject may have atherosclerosis resulting
          in reduced tissue oxygenation or DVT. The subject may be one
          with angina, such as angina pectoris, acute coronary syndrome,
          or had a myocardial infraction. The invention may also be used
          to treat individuals with reduced tissue inflammation due to
          ongoing inflammatory conditions or processes in the tissue,
          such as any of those referred to herein.<br>
          <br>
          [0111] Given the ability of the invention to reduce
          inflammatory markers, the invention may also be employed to
          help treat inflammatory or autoimmune disorders, for instance
          arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease and atherosclerosis.<br>
          <br>
          [0112] Another aspect of the invention provides a
          nutracosmetic formulation comprising one or more cocoa bean
          products and a carotenoid compound.<br>
          <br>
          [0113] Suitable cocoa bean products and carotenoid compounds
          are described in more detail above.<br>
          <br>

          cocoa bean products and a carotenoid compound as defined
          above, may further comprise one or more cosmetically or
          nutritionally acceptable carriers, adjuvants, excipients,
          sweeteners, diluents, fillers, buffers, stabilisers,
          preservatives, colourings, lubricants, or other materials well
          known to those skilled in the art.<br>
          <br>
          [0115] The term “nutraceutically acceptable” as used herein
          pertains to compounds, materials, compositions, and/or dosage
          forms which are in common or widespread usage in food and
          dietary products and are generally considered non-toxic, for
          example, compounds may have the US FDA designation “GRAS”
          (Generally Recognised as Safe), or equivalent food additive
          status in other jurisdictions.<br>
          <br>
          [0116] Nutracosmetic formulations are generally intended for
          oral administration and may be formulated accordingly.<br>
          <br>
          [0117] Nutracosmetic formulations may be useful in improving
          the appearance of an individual or in reducing, delaying or
          masking Visual signs of aging in an individual.<br>
          <br>
          [0118] The invention may be administered to treat, ameliorate,
          prevent, or reduce the severity of symptoms in any of the
          conditions referred to herein. In one instance, the invention
          is administered prophylatically to help prevent the onset of
          any of the conditions mentioned herein. The invention may
          result in reduction of any of the parameters discussed herein,
          it may, for instance, reduce cholesterol, triglyceride,
          inflammatory damage, weight or body fat.<br>
          <br>
          [0119] Various further aspects and embodiments of the present
          invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art in view
          of the present disclosure.<br>
          <br>
          [0120] All documents mentioned in this specification are
          incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.<br>
          <br>
          [0121] The term “and/or” where used herein is to be taken as
          specific disclosure of each of the two specified features or
          components with or without the other. For example “A and/or B”

          EXAMPLES<br>
          <br>
          Experiments<br>
          <br>
          Lipid-Lowering Chocolate (L-Chocolate)<br>
          <br>
          [0130] Commercially available dark chocolate (Green &amp;
          Black's Dark Chocolate; 85% cocoa) was melted at 70° C. The
          melted chocolate was mixed with tomato oleoresin, containing
          15% of lycopene (Lyc-O-Mato), in the ratio of 1.57 mg of
          oleoresin to 1 g of the chocolate. The mixture was blended for
          10 minutes and then divided into daily 10 g or 30 g portions
          and cooled down to the room temperature.<br>
          <br>
          [0131] Each 10 g or 30 g chocolate portion contained 47.1 mg
          of tomato oleoresin or about 7 mg of lycopene.<br>
          <br>
          Control Samples of Chocolate<br>
          <br>
          [0132] The melting and mixing procedures were performed as
          described above using the same commercially available dark
          chocolate, but instead of tomato oleoresin, sunflower oil
          (Floral™) was used.<br>
          <br>
          Lycopene<br>
          <br>
          [0133] 47.1 mg of tomato oleoresin was pre-dissolved in
          ethanol and mixed with Whey Protein as described in Richelle
          et al (2002) J Nutr 132 404-408, WO01/091588 and
          US2002/01072992. Then the mixture was placed into gelatine
          capsules.<br>
          <br>
          [0134] All products were kept in cool dry, protected from
          light conditions.<br>
          <br>
          Validation in Clinical Trials<br>
          <br>
          CHD Patients<br>
          <br>
          [0135] 18 male CHD patients, age 47-69, were recruited for
          this study.<br>
          <br>
          [0136] Main inclusion criteria were:<br>
          elevated total serum cholesterol above 200 mg/dL and/or
          triglycerides above 150 mg/dL,<br>
          all patients were naive for any lipid-lowering medications,<br>
          stable clinical conditions and regimen of medications was t
          the last 3 months.<br>
          <br>
          [0140] Secondary inclusion criteria were:<br>
          positive blood markers on inflammatory oxidative damage, IOD,
          &gt;20-30 µM MDA<br>
          positive blood on an antibody inflammatory marker,
          Px-IgG&gt;0.250-0.300 U/ml<br>
          <br>
          [0143] All patients were randomised and divided into three
          equal groups of 6 patients each. Two groups receiving
          chocolate were blinded; the group receiving lycopene
          preparation along was open labelled. The period of the trial
          was 4 weeks.<br>
          <br>
          Results<br>
          <br>
          [0144] The results of the ongoing trial are presented in the
          tables 1 to 3 below.<br>
          <br>
          [0145] It was observed that after two weeks of administration
          of 7 mg of lycopene, there were no changes in any patients on
          their levels of elevated cholesterol, triglycerides and
          markers of oxidative damage or inflammation (table 1).<br>
          <br>
          [0146] Similar results were observed in the group where
          patients were taking 30 g of the control bar of dark chocolate
          (table 2).<br>
          <br>
          [0147] However, in the group of patients taking 30 g of
          L-chocolate, a reduction in concentration of both total
          cholesterol and its LDL fraction was observed in every patient
          in the group even after the first seven days of the trial
          (table 3). The positive trend in triglyceride levels was also
          detected in 5 out of 6 patients.<br>
          <br>
          [0148] Furthermore, the elevated level of transferases in two
          patients in this group also started to decline, indicating a
          positive effect of L-chocolate on their liver damage status.
          In addition, for the majority of the patients administration
          of the L-chocolate was accompanied by reduction of
          inflammatory oxidative damage markers, indicating that this
          product has not only lipid-lowering properties but
          anti-inflammatory as well.<br>

          <b>Dose Effect</b><br>
          <br>
          [0149] 52 clinically healthy volunteers 26 males and 26
          females, age 35-61 years old, were recruited for this study.<br>
          <br>
          [0150] Main inclusion criteria were:<br>
          <br>
          [0000] elevated total serum cholesterol above 200 mg/dL and/or
          triglycerides above 150 mg/dL,<br>
          all patients were naive, for at least 3 months prior to the
          study, for any lipid-lowering medications, dietary supplements
          or special lipid or weight management diets,<br>
          willing participate in the study.<br>
          <br>
          [0151] All volunteers were randomised and divided into six
          groups. 10 participants were included in the control group and
          group which received chocolate containing 0.36 mg of lycopene
          per 1 gram of the product. Other four groups were formed from
          8 volunteers each. Every participant received the one week
          supply of the same size of 10 g of the chocolate bar with
          different concentration of lycopene, or without it at all.<br>
          <br>
          [0152] All chocolate samples were blinded so participants did
          not know what exactly composition of chocolate they were
          ingesting. All collected blood samples were also blinded so
          the analytical laboratory was not aware from which volunteers
          and from which group the samples were analysed. Every week
          participants were invited to the clinic when compliance of the
          ingesting chocolate was verified, blood from these persons was
          collected, and new batch of one week supply of chocolate was
          given.<br>
          <br>
          [0153] The duration of the trial was 4 weeks. Effects of the
          following concentrations of lycopene, “L-tug”, in the
          chocolate was studied: 0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.35, 0.7 mg of
          lycopene per 1 g of chocolate.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Results</b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          Cholesterol<br>
          <br>
          [0154] The effects of chocolate with different concentration
          of lycopene on the elevated level of the total cholesterol,
          and other biochemical parameters of the participants are
          presented in table 4a and table 5.<br>
          <br>
          [0155] These results showed that the chocolate with 0.1 mg of
          lycopene per 1 g of the product was already able to reduce
          elevated total cholesterol although the changes were not
          statistically significant. However, chocolate with 0.2 mg of
          lycopene and above, per 1 g of the product, were consistently
          producing cholesterol lowering effect in the serum of the
          participants. The significant effect was already registered
          from the second week of the trial and reached it maximum by
          the fourth week.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Biochemistry</b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          [0156] The effect of this lycopene/L-tug chocolate on other
          biochemical parameters was insignificant for the doses studied
          (table 5). Presumably this was because in most groups these
          parameters were within their physiological norms and there
          were no much room for their normalisation/“improvement”.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Inflammation and Oxidation</b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          [0157] However, the majority of the participants were positive
          on markers of Inflammatory Oxidative Damage, IOD, or in some
          cases on presence of such inflammatory markers as LDL-Px and
          Chl.-IgG. This was probably due that the majority of the
          participants were between 50 and 60 years old, and these
          markers can frequently be detected on a subclinical level even
          in apparently healthy people of this age and above.<br>
          <br>
          [0158] It all groups taking L-tug chocolate the reduction of
          the IOD was significant. However, reduction of two other
          inflammatory markers was observed only in some groups and was
          not apparently dose dependent. This inconsistency could be a
          result of a small number of participants in the tested groups.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Plasma Oxygen Transport</b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          [0159] The other interest observation was that ingestion of
          the L-tug chocolate resulted in the dose-dependent increase of
          the plasma oxygen transport. This useful property could be
          used to increase and/or restore supply of the molecular O2
          depression or reduction of which may occur not only in many
          clinical conditions but also during strenuous exercises, or
          with ageing.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Timing of the Ingestion of Chocolate in Relation to Food
            Intake.</b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          [0160] To evaluate a possible hypothesis that incorporation of
          lycopene into chylomicrons and lipoproteins, during their
          re-assembly at the time of digesting food fat, we undertake
          the following study. We recruited a group of clinically
          healthy volunteers of similar age and similar level of
          hypercholesterolaemia.<br>
          <br>
          [0161] The design of the study was the same as the study above
          but instead of taking L-tug chocolate with main food we asked
          participants to ingest the chocolate between meals—at least
          two hours after their breakfast, or lunch, and at least two
          hours before their next meal—lunch or dinner.<br>
          <br>
          [0162] The product used was the same format of 10 g containing
          0.7 mg of lycopene per 1 g of chocolate.<br>

          <b>Results</b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          [0163] The results of this study are presented in the table
          4b.<br>
          <br>
          [0164] It was observed that this regiment was also able to
          reduce elevated total cholesterol but the significant
          reduction was only observed on the week 3 of the trial. The
          maximum of the reduction was on the last 4th week.<br>
          <br>
          [0165] It was interesting to note, that although the
          cholesterol-lowering effect was prominent it was still
          significantly lower that then when the same chocolate was
          taken during the main meal. If the week 4 is taken as a
          reference point, the 0.7 mg dose of the L-tug chocolate
          ingested on the “empty stomach” was more effective that the
          dose 0.1 but lees effective than dose 0.2 mg when they were
          taken with food.<br>

          <b>Postprandial Study</b><br>
          <br>
          [0166] 8 clinically healthy volunteers 4 males and 4 females,
          age 35-60 years old, were recruited for this study.<br>
          <br>
          [0167] Main inclusion criteria were:<br>
          all patients were naive, for at least 3 months prior to the
          study, for any lipid-lowering medications, dietary supplements
          or special lipid or weight management diets,<br>
          willing participate in the study.<br>
          <br>
          [0170] All volunteers received standardise fat rich meal
          comprising of 50 g of butter as a part of a sandwich with 2
          slices of white bread. Then without any break volunteers were
          asked to ingestion 10 g chocolate bar without lycopene. During
          intake of this test meal volunteers was given 200 ml of warm
          decaffeinated tea with skimmed milk containing no more than 1%
          of dairy fat.<br>
          <br>
          [0171] The blood was collected just before the intake of the
          meal and every hour for 4 hours after that.<br>
          <br>
          [0172] After one week of break the same volunteers were ask to
          take exactly the same meal of 50 g of the same butter with two
          slices of the same white bread. Then each of them was asked to
          take 10 g of the chocolate bar with 7 mg of lycopene blended
          in at the protocol described above. The same type and the
          volume of tea was allowed, and the blood was collected at the
          same protocol as in the previous week.<br>
          <br>
          [0173] The results of this cross-over study are presented in
          the table 6. They show that ingestion of lycopene-contained
          chocolate was able to reduce elevation of postprandial
          triglycerides about two fold and cholesterol between 2 and 3
          times. I was also interesting to note that the postprandial
          glycaemia was also reduced by this L-tug chocolate.<br>
          <br>
          [0174] The most remarkable changes were observed when this
          chocolate with the embedded lycopene was not only able to
          prevent increase of the inflammatory oxidative markers in the
          postprandial blood but even cause their reduction below the
          baseline level (table 6).<br>

          New Opportunities to Control Lipid Metabolism Inflammation and
          Tissue Oxygenation<br>
          <br>
          [0175] The results presented here open a possible new
          mechanisms and new ways not only to control already developed
          changes in the lipid metabolism but also to prevent these
          changes.<br>
          <br>
          [0176] These results also provide for the development of new
          ways to control subclinical and other forms of inflammation
          and/or boosting transport of the plasma molecular oxygen,
          which could be useful to restore tissue oxygen saturation
          which could be important in many clinical conditions and to
          delay ageing.<br>
          <br>
          [0177] The results described herein are unexpected because the
          benefit of adding any ingredient with additional health value
          to a chocolate product would be expected to be outweighed by
          the potential harmful consequences of consuming increased
          amounts of this high-fat food product.<br>
          <br>
          [0178] Reducing fat content in food products is the standard
          way to minimise their fat load to the body. However this
          approach is not generally useful for cocoa-based products,
          such as chocolate, because fat reduction negatively affects
          the melting, feeling and taste properties.<br>
          <br>
          [0179] The results described herein show the unusual and
          unexpected outcome of the blending of carotenoids such as
          lycopene with cocoa-based products. Not only is cocoa butter
          prevented from contributing to the rise of blood lipids, but
          the blend actively reduces lipids which are already at an
          elevated level.<br>
          <br>
          [0180] In other words, the invention described herein not only
          makes cocoa products, such as chocolate, “safer” from the
          health impact point of view, but may also make it useful as a
          proactive interventional product for slimming, lipid-lowering
          purposes and anti-aging purposes, and for prevention and help
          in management of metabolic, pre-diabetes, cardio-vascular and
          other conditions.<br>

        <div align="left"><br>
          This invention relates to the incorporation of bioactive cargo
          molecules into particles with carotenoids, such as lycopene.
          The incorporation of a cargo molecule into a carotenoid
          particle may for example increase the bioavailability of the
          cargo molecule in the bloodstream compared to other delivery
          systems. Carotenoid particles as described herein may be
          useful in the formulation of therapeutic and nutritional
          compounds for oral administration to individuals.<br>
          <br>
          [0001] This invention relates to vehicles for the delivery of
          molecules into the bloodstream of individuals.<br>
          <br>
          [0002] Substances which are administered orally, such as
          pharmaceuticals and dietary supplements, are often modified or
          damaged, for example by enzymatic degradation, oxidation or
          stomach acidity, in the gastrointestinal tract. This
          modification or damage reduces the absorption and subsequent
          bioavailability of the substance in the blood stream.<br>
          <br>
          [0003] Formulation with a carrier may increase the amount of a
          labile substance which is absorbed in an unmodified or
          undamaged form, thereby increasing its bioavailability in the
          bloodstream.<br>
          <br>
          [0004] Whey protein has previously been used as a carrier to
          increase the activity of lycopene (Richelle et al J. Nutr.
          132:404-408, 2002; PCT/EP01/06145). Lycopene formulated with a
          whey protein carrier has been reported to inhibit atherogenic
          serum abzymes and be useful in the treatment of
          atherosclerotic conditions (WO2007/010216).<br>
          <br>
          [0005] This invention relates to the finding that carotenoids,
          such as lycopene, may be useful in delivering cargo molecules
          into the bloodstream. The incorporation of a cargo molecule
          into a carotenoid particle may lead to increased
          bioavailability of the cargo molecule in the bloodstream
          compared to other delivery systems, allowing the dose required
          to achieve efficacy to be reduced or increasing the efficacy
          of the same dose. Carotenoid particles may be useful in the
          formulation of therapeutic and nutritional compounds for oral
          administration to individuals.<br>
          <br>
          [0006] An aspect of the invention provides a population of
          particles, each particle comprising a carotenoid compound and
          one or more cargo molecules.<br>
          <br>
          [0007] Carotenoids are resistant to enzymatic degradation in
          the gastrointestinal tract. The incorporation of cargo
          molecules into carotenoid particles as described herein
          provides protection from damage and/or modification in the
          gastrointestinal tract.<br>
          <br>
          [0008] In some embodiments, in one or more of the carotenoid
          particles in the population, the carotenoid compound may form
          layer, for example an outer layer or interim layer which
          encapsulates an inner core comprising the one or more cargo
          molecules (i.e. micelles or reverse micelles). For example, 1%
          or more, 10% or more, 20% or more, 30% or more or 40% or more
          of the particles in the population may possess this micelle
          structure. Up to 100%, up to 95%, up to 90%, up to 80%, up to
          70% or up to 60% of the particles in the population may
          possess this micelle structure. Carotenoid micelles may be
          soluble, and may for example exist in aqueous solution.<br>
          <br>
          [0009] In some embodiments, in one or more of the carotenoid
          particles in the population, the carotenoid compound may form
          a matrix into which cargo molecules or their hydrophobic
          moieties are anchored or embedded (i.e. a non-micelle or
          composite particle). For example, 1% or more, 10% or more, 20%
          or more, 30% or more or 40% or more of the particles in the
          population may possess this composite structure. Up to 100%,
          up to 95%, up to 90%, up to 80%, up to 70% or up to 60% of the
          particles in the population may possess this composite
          structure. Non-micelle particles may exist in a dried form or
          as suspensions or colloids.<br>
          <br>
          [0010] The proportion of particles in a population with
          micelle or non-micelle structure may be determined using
          routine techniques.<br>
          <br>
          [0011] The carotenoid particles in a population may have
          uniform or substantially uniform structures (i.e. a homogenous
          population) or non-uniform or substantially non-uniform
          structures (i.e. a heterogeneous population).<br>
          <br>
          [0012] The carotenoid particles may exist in aggregates or
          clusters within a population.<br>
          <br>
          [0013] The structures adopted by carotenoid particles in a
          population depend on a number of factors, including the
          production method, the size, shape and hydrophobicity of the
          cargo molecule(s), the ratio of carotenoids to cargo
          molecules, the presence of surfactants, the ratio between the
          hydrophobic and hydrophilic parts of the cargo molecule(s) and
          the homogeneity and purity of the cargo molecule(s),
          especially if the particles contain more than one type of
          cargo molecule.<br>
          <br>
          [0014] Carotenoid compounds are a class of tetraterpenoids
          which contain long polyene chains. Carotenoids include
          xanthophylls such as lutein and zeaxanthin, and carotenes,
          such as beta-carotene, alpha-carotene, zeto-carotene, and
          lycopene and related molecules, including
          1-HO-3',4'-didehydrolycopene, 3,1'-(HO)2-gamma-carotene,
          1,1'-(HO)2-3,4,3',4'-tetradehydrolycopene,
          1,1'-(HO)2-3,4-didehydrolycopene.<br>
          <br>
          [0015] Other suitable carotenoid compounds which may be used
          as described herein include hydrocarbons, such as lycopersene
          (7,8,11,12,15,7',8',11',12',15'-decahydro-?,?-carotene),

          [0016] A carotenoid particle as described herein may contain a
          single carotenoid compound (e.g. lycopene) or more than one
          carotenoid compound (e.g. lycopene and beta-carotene).
          Typically, each carotenoid compound will be present in a range
          of different isomeric forms.<br>
          <br>
          [0017] In some preferred embodiments, the carotenoid compound
          is lycopene. Lycopene is an open-chain unsaturated C40
          carotenoid of structure I (Chemical Abstracts Service Registry
          Number 502-65-8).<br>
          <br>
          [0000]<br>
          &lt;img class="EMIRef" id="179474341-emi-c00001" /&gt;<br>
          <br>
          [0018] Lycopene occurs naturally in plants such as tomatoes,
          guava, rosehip, watermelon and pink grapefruit.<br>
          <br>
          [0019] Lycopene for use as described herein may comprise one
          or more different isomers. For example, lycopene may comprise
          at least 10%, at least 20%, at least 30%, at least 40%, at
          least 50%, at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80%, at least
          90%, or at least 95% (Z)-isomers, (all-E)-isomers, or
          cis-isomers, such as 5-cis- or 9-cis- or 13-cis-isomers, which
          have improved bioavailability relative to trans isomers. Trans
          isomers may isomerise into cis forms in vivo, or during
          storage and processing. Carotenoid particles comprising
          lycopene may be referred to herein as Lycosomes™.<br>
          <br>
          [0020] Carotenoid compounds for use as described herein may be
          natural i.e. obtained from a natural source, for example,
          extracted from a plant, such as a tomato or melon. A range of
          methods for extracting, concentrating and/or purifying
          carotenoids from plants are known in the art. For example,
          solvent extraction using ethanol, DMSO, ethyl acetate, hexane,
          acetone, soya or other vegetable oil, or non-vegetable oils
          may be employed. A carotenoid compound may be isolated i.e.
          free or substantially free of other molecules found in its
          natural source or environment.<br>
          <br>
          [0021] Carotenoid compounds for use as described herein may be
          synthetic i.e. produced by artificial means, for example, by
          chemical synthesis or fermentation. A range of methods for
          chemical synthesis of lycopene and other carotenoids are known
          in the art. For example, a three-stage chemical synthesis
          based on the standard Wittig olefination reaction scheme for
          carotenoid synthesis may be employed, in which an organic
          solution of C15 phosphonium methanesulfonate in
          dichloromethane (DCM) and an organic solution of C10
          dialdehyde in toluene are produced, and the two organic
          solutions are gradually combined with sodium methoxide
          solution and undergo a condensation reaction to form crude
          lycopene. The crude lycopene may then be purified using
          routine techniques, for example by adding glacial acetic acid
          and deionized water to the mixture, stirring vigorously,
          allowing the aqueous and organic phases to separate, and
          extracting the organic phase containing DCM and crude lycopene
          with water. Methanol is added to the organic phase and the DCM
          removed via distillation under reduced pressure. The crude
          methanolic lycopene solution is then be heated and cooled to
          crystalline slurry that is filtered and washed with methanol.
          The lycopene crystals may then be recrystallized and dried
          under heated nitrogen. Synthetic carotenoids, such as
          lycopene, are also available from commercial suppliers (e.g.
          BASF Corp, NJ USA, DSM Nutritional Products, Basel, CH).<br>
          <br>
          [0022] Synthetic carotenoids may comprise an increased
          proportion of cis isomers relative to natural carotenoids. For
          example, synthetic forms of carotenoids such as lycopene may
          be up to 25% 5-cis, 1% 9-cis, 1% 13-cis, and 3% other cis
          isomers, whilst natural forms of carotenoids, for example
          lycopene produced by tomatoes, may be 3-5% 5-cis, 0-1% 9-cis,
          1% 13-cis, and &lt;1% other cis isomers. Since
          cis-carotenoids, such as cis-lycopene, have increased
          bioavailability relative to trans-carotenoids, such as
          trans-lycopene, synthetic carotenoids may be preferred in some
          embodiments.<br>
          <br>
          [0023] Derivatives of carotenoids as described above may be
          produced by chemical synthesis analogous to the synthesis
          described above; by chemical modification of natural
          carotenoids extracted from plant material or by microbial,
          yeast, algal, or fungal fermentation. For example, lycopene
          may be produced by fermentation of the fungus Blakeslea
          trispora (e.g. Lyconat™, Vitatene SA).<br>
          <br>
          [0024] The population of carotenoid particles may comprise
          0.05 to 90% by weight of the carotenoid compound, preferably
          0.1% to 10% by weight. For example, the population may be
          0.01% or more, 0.05% or more, 0.1% or more, 0.2% or more, 0.5%
          or more, 1% or more, 10% or more, or 20% or more by weight of
          carotenoid compound. The population may be up to 90%, up to
          80%, up to 70%, up to 60% up to 50%, up to 40%, up to 30%, up
          to 20% or up to 10% by weight of carotenoid compound.<br>
          <br>
          [0025] The carotenoid particles in the population may contain
          the same or similar amounts of carotenoid compound or the
          amount of carotenoid compound may vary between particles in
          the population. Each carotenoid particle in the population may
          comprise 0.05 to 90% by weight of carotenoid compound. For
          example, each carotenoid particle in the population may be
          0.05% or more, 0.1% or more, 1% or more, 10% or more, or 20%
          or more by weight of carotenoid molecules. Each carotenoid
          particle may be up to 90%, up to 80%, up to 70%, up to 60% up
          to 50%, up to 40% or up to 30%, up to 90% or more by weight of
          carotenoid compound.<br>
          <br>
          [0026] The extent of particle variability within a population
          may vary depending on the production method. Preferably, at
          least 80%, at least 90%, at least 95%, at least 98% or at
          least 99%, for example 85% to 95%, of the carotenoid particles
          in the population contain the same or similar amounts of
          carotenoid compound.<br>
          <br>
          [0027] Typically, a population of carotenoid particles may be
          comprised in a unit dosage formulation which contains 1 to 10
          mg of carotenoid compound, such as lycopene, for example about
          3.5 mg lycopene.<br>
          <br>
          [0028] The cargo molecule which is incorporated into the
          carotenoid particle may be any compound, agent, drug or other
          product or combination thereof, which needs to be delivered to
          the blood stream. Typically, the cargo molecule will be a
          therapeutic or nutritional compound, such as a pharmaceutical,
          nutraceutical or a dietary or nutritional supplement.<br>
          <br>
          [0029] Cargo molecules which are labile in the
          gastro-intestinal tract or poorly absorbed by the
          gastro-intestinal tract are especially suitable for
          incorporation into carotenoid particles.<br>
          <br>
          [0030] Suitable cargo molecules include products of the
          fermentation, oxidation, processing or degradation of foods
          such as meat, fish, dairy, grain, bean, honey, tea or other
          foodstuffs or beverages. Products may include whey protein or
          peptides, carbohydrates, such as poly- or oligosaccharides,
          lipids, flavones, and other food derived bioactive molecules.
          Bioactive molecules may, for example, include antimicrobial
          peptides, defensins, cathelidins, whey acid proteins,
          bioactive fragments of food proteins; and peptides which
          display one or more of protease inhibiting, bactericidic,
          metabolic, anti-inflammatory, immune-stimulating, coagulation,
          angiogenesis and proliferation control activities, or exert a
          beneficial effect on neurotransmitters, angiotensin, hormones
          and/or other signalling pathways.<br>

          or more than one type of cargo molecule, for example two,
          three, four or more different types of cargo molecule.<br>
          <br>
          [0034] The carotenoid particle may comprise 0.05 to 90% by
          weight of cargo molecules. For example, the carotenoid
          particle may be 0.1% or more, 1% or more, 10% or more, or 20%
          or more by weight of cargo molecules. The carotenoid particle

          <br>
          [0038] In other embodiments, a carotenoid particle may
          comprise lycopene and a statin, such as simvastatin, in a
          ratio (w/w) of from 0.1 to 0.5, preferably 0.3 to 0.4, for
          example 0.35. For example, a population of carotenoid
          particles in a unit dosage format may contain 2 to 10 mg, for
          example 7 mg, of lycopene and 20 mg of statin.<br>
          <br>
          [0039] The bioavailability of the cargo molecule in
          circulation following oral administration of carotenoid
          particles incorporating the cargo molecule may be increased
          relative to bioavailability following oral administration of
          the cargo molecule alone.<br>
          <br>
          [0040] Increased bioavailability may allow the dosage of the
          cargo molecule to be reduced when it is incorporated into
          carotenoid particles as described herein compared to
          administration without the particles, whilst achieving the
          same efficacy. This may be useful in reducing side-effects
          associated with the cargo molecule. For example, the dosage of
          the cargo molecule incorporated into a carotenoid particle may
          be 1% or less, 5% or less, 10% or less, 20% or less, 30% or
          less, 40% or less or 50% or less of the dosage of the cargo
          molecule on its own which is required for the same efficacy.<br>
          <br>
          [0041] The bioavailability of the cargo molecule may be
          increased by two fold or more, three fold or more or four fold
          or more by incorporation into carotenoid particles as
          described herein. For example, the data herein shows that the
          bioavailability of resveratrol is increased by two fold and
          the bioavailability of simvastatin is increased by four fold
          by incorporation into a carotenoid particle. In some
          embodiments, the cargo molecule may display no bioavailability
          or substantially no bioavailability when it is administered
          without incorporation into a carotenoid particle. For example,
          whey protein is shown to display little or no bioavailability
          when administered orally without incorporation into a
          carotenoid particle.<br>
          <br>
          [0042] At the same dosage, the efficacy of the cargo molecule
          may be increased when it is incorporated into carotenoid
          particles as described herein compared to its efficacy without
          such incorporation. For example, the efficacy of the cargo
          molecule incorporated into a carotenoid particle may be
          increased by 2 fold or more, 3 fold or more, 5 fold or more,
          10 fold or more or 100 fold or more compared to the efficacy
          of the same dosage of cargo molecule on its own.<br>
          <br>
          [0043] Carotenoid particles as described herein may be useful
          in targeting cargo molecules to tissues which express
          carotenoid receptors.<br>
          <br>
          [0044] A method of improving the delivery of a cargo molecule
          to a target tissue which expresses carotenoid receptors may
          comprise:<br>
          <br>
          incorporating the cargo molecule into a carotenoid particle as
          described herein and,<br>
          administering the carotenoid particle to an individual.<br>
          <br>
          [0047] Tissues which express carotenoid receptors include
          hepatocytes, liver, adrenal glands, lymphocytes, lymph nodes,
          prostate tissues and testis. In some preferred embodiments,
          the target tissue which expresses carotenoid receptors is
          liver.<br>
          <br>
          [0048] Suitable cargo molecules may include compounds which
          are beneficially targeted to tissues which express carotenoid
          receptors, such as the liver.<br>
          <br>
          [0049] Suitable cargo molecules for delivery to the liver
          include prodrugs which are activated in the liver, for example
          by the action of liver enzymes. Prodrugs which are activated
          by liver enzymes include aldehyde oxidase activated prodrugs,
          such as 5-ethynalyl-2(1H)-pyrimidinone,
          5-iodo-2-pyrimidinone-2'-deoxyribose (IPdR), and
          5-fluoro-2-pyrimidinone (5-FP); cytochrome P450 reductase
          activated prodrugs, such as menadione, mitomycin C,
          tirapazamine and E09
          (3-hydroxymethyl-5-aziridinyl-1-methyl-2[1H-indole-4,7-dione]prop-2-en-1-ol);









          cytochrome p450 activated prodrugs, such as 4-ipomeanol,
          ftorafir, dacarbazine, trofosamide, ifosamide,
          cyclophosphamide, and
          1,4-bis-{[2-(dimethylamino-N-oxide)ethyl]amino}-5,8-dihydroxyanthracene-9,10-dione









          (AQ4N); thymidine phosphorylase activated prodrugs such as
          5'-deoxy-5-fluorouridine, and glutathione transferase
          activated prodrugs, such as
          ?-Glutamyl-a-amino-ß(2-ethyl-N,N,N',N'-tetrakis(2-chloroethyl)phosphoro-diamidate)sulfonyl-propionyl)-(R)-(-)phenylglycine









          (Ter286), S—CPHC-ethylsulfoxide
          (S—(N-p-chlorophenyl-N-hydroxycarbamoyl)ethylsulfoxide) and
          cis-3-(9H-Purin-6-ylthio) acrylic acid (PTA).<br>
          <br>
          [0050] Other suitable prodrugs are well-known in the art and
          include lisdexamphetamine, codeine and tramadol.<br>
          <br>
          [0051] Administration of carotenoid particles incorporating
          the cargo molecule may increase the concentration of the cargo
          molecule in the target tissue following relative to the
          concentration after administration of the same dose of cargo
          molecule on its own.<br>
          <br>
          [0052] Administration of the carotenoid particle incorporating
          the cargo molecule may provide a decreased concentration of
          the cargo molecule in non-target tissue following relative to
          the concentration after administration of the same dose of
          cargo molecule on its own.<br>
          <br>
          [0053] Methods as described herein are generally useful in
          increasing the availability of cargo molecules. A method of
          increasing the bioavailability of a cargo molecule may
          comprise:<br>
          <br>
          incorporating the cargo molecule into a carotenoid particle as
          described herein.<br>
          <br>
          [0055] Following incorporation of the cargo molecule into the
          carotenoid particles, and optional formulation into a
          composition, such as a pharmaceutical composition, food
          additive or dietary supplement, the carotenoid particles may
          be administered to an individual.<br>
          <br>
          [0056] In some embodiments, the cargo molecule may be whey
          protein. Whey protein is shown herein to possess
          anti-Chlamydia and cholesterol lowering activity. Whey protein
          is a collection of globular proteins which are naturally found
          in milk. It is isolated from whey, which is a by-product of
          cheese manufacture. It is a mixture of beta-lactoglobulin (
          ~65%), alpha-lactalbumin ( ~25%), and serum albumin ( ~8%),
          which are soluble in their native forms, independent of pH.
          Whey protein is commercially available from a number of
          suppliers (e.g. Eurosérum, France).<br>
          <br>
          [0057] In some embodiments, the cargo molecule is not a
          lactoprotein, such as casein, beta-lactoglobulin,
          alpha-lactalbumin, and serum albumin. In such embodiments,
          carotenoid particles as described herein may be devoid of
          lactoproteins.<br>
          <br>
          [0058] In some embodiments, the cargo molecules are not whey
          proteins and/or whey peptides. In such embodiments, carotenoid
          particles as described herein may be devoid of whey proteins
          and/or whey peptides.<br>
          <br>
          [0059] In some preferred embodiments, the carotenoid particle
          may further comprise lecithin. Lecithin (E222) is commonly
          used as an emulsifier in food products and may be isolated
          from egg yolk or animal or soy or other plant tissue. Lecithin
          comprises a number of fatty acids, phospholipids,
          triglycerides, and glycolipids, as well as glycerol, choline
          and phosphoric acid. Lecithin is widely available
          commercially. Lecithin may include soy-lecithin.<br>
          <br>
          [0060] A carotenoid particle as described herein may comprise
          from 1.5% to 98.5% (w/w) lecithin. For example, a particle may
          comprise at least 1.5%, at least 5%, or at least 10% (w/w)
          lecithin. A particle may comprise up to 98.5%, up to 90%, or
          up to 80% (w/w) lecithin.<br>
          <br>
          [0061] The ratio of lecithin to carotenoid molecule in the
          carotenoid particle by weight may be 0.1 or more, 1 or more,
          10 or more, or 20 or more. The ratio of lecithin to carotenoid
          molecule in the carotenoid particle by weight may be up to
          1000, up to 500, up to 200, or up to 100.<br>
          <br>
          [0062] The ratio of lecithin to cargo molecule in the
          carotenoid particle by weight may be 0.01 or more, 0.1 or
          more, 1 or more, or 2 or more. The ratio of lecithin to cargo
          molecule in the carotenoid particle by weight may be up to
          100, up to 50, up to 20, or up to 10.<br>
          <br>
          [0063] In some embodiments, a carotenoid particle may comprise
          lycopene, whey protein and lecithin in the ratio (w/w) of
          about 1:10:50. For example, a population of carotenoid
          particles in a unit dosage format may contain 3.5 mg of
          lycopene, 35 mg of whey protein and 175 mg lecithin.<br>
          <br>
          [0064] Carotenoid particles as described herein may be
          packaged into chylomicrons upon absorption from the
          gastrointestinal tract for transport through the blood stream.
          The size of the particles is preferably suitable for
          chylomicron packaging. Carotenoid particles may be fine (100
          nm to 2.5 µm), or ultrafine (1 to 100 nm). For example, the
          carotenoid particles may be from 0.1 nm to 1 µm in size,
          preferably 1 to 900 nm, more preferably 10 to 800 nm.<br>
          <br>
          [0065] A suitable particle may be from 0.1 nm to 1 µm in its
          longest dimension (e.g. length, width, height and/or
          diameter). Preferably, all of the dimensions of the particle
          are from 0.1 nm to 1 µm.<br>
          <br>
          [0066] Particle size may be determined by any convenient
          technique. For example, sieve analysis, laser diffraction, or
          photoanalysis.<br>
          <br>
          [0067] A population of carotenoid particles may be uniform
          size (i.e. have a low size distribution) or non-uniform (i.e.
          have a high size distribution).<br>
          <br>
          [0068] Preferably, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 95% or
          at least 99% of the particles in the population display
          uniform size or substantially uniform size (e.g. within 5% or
          within 10% of the mean particle size).<br>
          <br>
          [0069] A population of carotenoid particles may contain
          particles having a range of different shapes and sizes.<br>
          <br>
          [0070] In some embodiments, a population of carotenoid
          particles may comprise inverse micelles in which carotenoids
          molecules are encapsulated by an outer later of cargo
          molecules, the hydrophobic structures of the cargo molecules
          facing the interior.<br>
          <br>
          [0071] In some embodiments, a population of carotenoid
          particles may comprise aggregates comprising a carotenoid
          matrix which is embedded with hydrophobic parts of the cargo
          molecules. A range of different amphiphilic particles may be
          produced, depending on the nature and amount of the embedded
          and exposed regions of the cargo molecules.<br>
          <br>
          [0072] When parts of the cargo molecule remain on the exterior
          of the carotenoid particle, the particles in the population
          may form clusters or aggregates. The size and shape of these
          clusters depends on the architecture of the cargo molecules
          and may also be influenced by the presence of other molecules,
          which may interact or complex with the cargo molecules.<br>
          <br>
          [0073] Carotenoid particles as described herein may be
          produced by any convenient method.<br>
          <br>
          [0074] In some embodiments, a population of carotenoid
          particles may be produced by a method comprising:<br>
          <br>
          dissolving a carotenoid compound in a first solvent to produce
          a first solution and a cargo molecule in a second solvent to
          produce a second solution, and<br>
          admixing the first and second solutions under conditions which
          allow the cargo molecule to incorporate into the matrix of the
          carotenoid compound.<br>
          <br>
          [0077] The carotenoid compound may be dissolved in any
          suitable pharmaceutically compatible solvent, for example oil,
          acetone, ethanol or isopropanol, most preferably ethanol or
          vegetable oil.<br>
          <br>
          [0078] The cargo molecule may be dissolved in any suitable
          pharmaceutically compatible solvent. Suitable solvents include
          water, oil, acetone, ethanol or isopropanol. The choice of
          solvent will depend on the cargo molecule. For example, whey
          protein may be dissolved in water and resvertrol and statins,
          such as simvastatin, may be dissolved in ethanol. The skilled
          person is readily able to identify a suitable solvent for any
          given cargo molecule using readily available information or
          standard analytical techniques.<br>
          <br>
          [0079] The first solvent and the second solvent may be the
          same or different depending on the carotenoid and cargo
          molecule used.<br>
          <br>
          [0080] The carotenoid and the cargo molecule may be completely
          soluble in the first and second solvents or sufficiently
          soluble to facilitate incorporation of the cargo molecule, or
          its hydrophobic moieties, into the carotenoid matrix.<br>
          <br>
          [0081] The first and second solutions may be mixed under
          conditions which allow the formation of matrix of carotenoid
          compound which incorporates the cargo molecule. For example,
          when an aqueous solution of cargo molecules is mixed with a
          solution of carotenoid compound in ethanol, a solvent/water
          ratio by volume of the order of 60/40 may be chosen.<br>
          <br>
          [0082] Without being bound by any theory, carotenoid particles
          are driven to form spontaneously in solution through
          thermodynamics and the balance between entropy and enthalpy.<br>
          <br>
          [0083] In aqueous solution, the hydrophobicity of the
          carotenoid compound drives the formation of particles, even
          though assembling molecules together into particles leads to a
          reduction in entropy. At very low concentrations of
          carotenoid, only monomers are present in true solution. As the
          concentration of the carotenoid increases, a point is reached
          at which unfavourable entropy considerations derived from the
          hydrophobic hydrocarbon chain of the carotenoid become
          dominant.<br>
          <br>
          [0084] At this point, the hydrophobic end of the carotenoid is
          sequestered away from the water and carotenoid particles start
          to form. Above the critical carotenoid concentration, the
          entropic penalty of assembling the carotenoid monomers into
          particles is less than the entropic penalty of caging the
          carotenoid monomers with water molecules.<br>
          <br>
          [0085] After mixing, the mixture of the first and second
          solvents may be left to stand for 30 to 60 min at a
          temperature slightly higher than ambient temperature. The
          solvents may then be evaporated or the mixture spray dried to
          produce a composition in emulsion or dispersion form.
          Evaporation may be conveniently achieved using reduced
          pressure (e.g. 200 to 300 mbar). The composition may then be
          further treated, for example by drying to produce a powder or
          by heat-treating to produce a gel.<br>
          <br>
          [0086] In other embodiments, carotenoid particles as described
          herein may be produced by a method comprising:<br>
          <br>
          dissolving a carotenoid compound in a first solvent to produce
          a first solution,<br>
          admixing the first solution with dried particles of the cargo
          molecule under conditions which allow the dried particles to
          be incorporated in liquid carotenoid droplets.<br>
          <br>
          [0089] For example, lycopene dissolved in ethanol or acetone
          solution may be sprayed over a powder of dry particles of
          cargo molecule. When liquid droplets of lycopene crystallise
          on the surface of the powder, some of the dry particles are
          mechanically captured by the lycopene crystals.<br>
          <br>
          [0090] The first solvent may then be dried out or evaporated
          to produce carotenoid particles in concentrated and/or dried
          form which incorporate the cargo molecule. Alternatively, the
          mixture of the pre-solubilised lycopene and the initially
          dried product may remain in a form of a suspension or emulsion
          in the first solvent.<br>
          <br>
          [0091] In some embodiments, carotenoid particles may be
          produced by sonication of the mixture of first and second
          solutions. Sonication may be especially useful in admixing
          carotenoid compounds and cargo molecules which are dissolved
          in immiscible solvents. Ultrasound energy allows molecules to
          transiently cross the thermodynamic barrier imposed by the
          solvent environments, allowing blending and the formation of
          carotenoid particles, such as lycosome micelles.<br>
          <br>
          [0092] In some embodiments, carotenoid particles may be
          produced by spray-drying the mixture of first and second
          solutions.<br>
          <br>
          [0093] In some embodiments, lecithin may be incorporated into
          the carotenoid particles. In some embodiments, lecithin may be
          admixed with the first and second solutions. Alternatively,
          lecithin dissolved in oil may be admixed with the concentrated
          or dried admixture comprising the carotenoid particles after
          evaporation and/or spray drying.<br>
          <br>
          [0094] While it is possible for carotenoid particles to be
          administered alone, it is preferable to present them as a
          composition (e.g., formulation), such as a food product, food
          additive, fortified food, dietary supplement, nutraceutical or
          pharmaceutical composition which comprises carotenoid
          particles, as defined above, together with one or more
          pharmaceutically or nutritionally acceptable carriers,
          adjuvants, excipients, diluents, fillers, buffers,
          stabilisers, flavourings, preservatives, sweeteners,
          colourings, lubricants, or other materials well known to those
          skilled in the art and optionally other food products, dietary
          supplements or nutraceutical, therapeutic or prophylactic
          agents.<br>
          <br>
          [0095] Compositions or formulations comprising carotenoid
          particles as defined above, for example carotenoid particles
          admixed together with one or more pharmaceutically or
          nutraceutically acceptable carriers, excipients, buffers,
          adjuvants, stabilisers, or other materials, as described
          herein, may be used in the methods described herein.<br>
          <br>
          [0096] The term “pharmaceutically acceptable” as used herein
          pertains to compounds, materials, compositions, and/or dosage
          forms which are, within the scope of sound medical judgement,
          suitable for use in contact with the tissues of a subject
          (e.g., human) without excessive toxicity, irritation, allergic
          response, or other problem or complication, commensurate with
          a reasonable benefit/risk ratio. Each carrier, excipient, etc.
          must also be “acceptable” in the sense of being compatible
          with the other ingredients of the formulation.<br>
          <br>
          [0097] Suitable carriers, excipients, etc. can be found in
          standard pharmaceutical texts, for example, Remington's
          Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th edition, Mack Publishing
          Company, Easton, Pa., 1990.<br>
          <br>
          [0098] The term “nutraceutically acceptable” as used herein
          pertains to compounds, materials, compositions, and/or dosage
          forms which are in common or widespread usage in food and
          dietary products and are generally considered non-toxic, for
          example, compounds may have the US FDA designation “GRAS”
          (Generally Recognised as Safe), or equivalent food additive
          status in other jurisdictions.<br>
          <br>
          [0099] The formulations may conveniently be presented in unit
          dosage form and may be prepared by any methods well known in
          the art of pharmacy, food science or nutrition. Such methods
          include the step of bringing the carotenoid particles into
          association with a carrier which may constitute one or more
          accessory ingredients. In general, the formulations are
          prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association
          the carotenoid particles with liquid carriers or finely
          divided solid carriers or both, and then if necessary shaping
          the product.<br>
          <br>
          [0100] Formulations may be in the form of food products,
          beverages, liquids, solutions, suspensions, emulsions,
          elixirs, syrups, tablets, lozenges, granules, powders,
          capsules, cachets, pills, ampoules, ointments, gels, pastes,
          creams, sprays, mists, foams, lotions, oils, boluses,
          electuaries, or aerosols.<br>
          <br>
          [0101] The carotenoid particles or compositions comprising the
          carotenoid particles are preferably in a form which is
          suitable for administration orally for delivery via the
          gastro-intestinal tract. Formulations suitable for oral
          administration (e.g., by ingestion) may be presented as
          discrete units such as capsules, cachets or tablets, each
          containing a predetermined amount of the active compound; as a
          powder or granules; as a solution or suspension in an aqueous
          or non-aqueous liquid; or as an oil-in-water liquid emulsion
          or a water-in-oil liquid emulsion; as a bolus; as an
          electuary; or as a paste.<br>
          <br>
          [0102] A tablet may be made by conventional means, e.g.,
          compression or molding, optionally with one or more accessory
          ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing
          in a suitable machine the active compound in a free-flowing
          form such as a powder or granules, optionally mixed with one
          or more binders (e.g., povidone, gelatin, acacia, sorbitol,
          tragacanth, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose); fillers or
          diluents (e.g., lactose, microcrystalline cellulose, calcium
          hydrogen phosphate); lubricants (e.g., magnesium stearate,
          talc, silica); disintegrants (e.g., sodium starch glycolate,
          cross-linked povidone, cross-linked sodium carboxymethyl
          cellulose); surface-active or dispersing or wetting agents
          (e.g., sodium lauryl sulfate); and preservatives (e.g., methyl
          p-hydroxybenzoate, propyl p-hydroxybenzoate, sorbic acid).
          Molded tablets may be made by molding in a suitable machine a
          mixture of the powdered compound moistened with an inert
          liquid diluent. The tablets may optionally be coated or scored
          and may be formulated so as to provide slow or controlled
          release of the active compound therein using, for example,
          hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose in varying proportions to
          provide the desired release profile.<br>
          <br>
          [0103] Compositions for oral administration may further
          comprise sweeteners, texture modifiers, colourings and
          flavourings.<br>
          <br>
          [0104] Aspects of the invention provide a method of producing
          a formulation, such as a nutraceutical or pharmaceutical
          composition, which has increased bioavailability of a cargo
          molecule comprising incorporating the cargo molecule into a
          carotenoid particle.<br>
          <br>
          [0105] The cargo molecule may display increased
          bioavailability following oral administration when
          incorporated into a carotenoid particle relative to cargo
          molecule alone.<br>
          <br>
          [0106] Methods of incorporating a cargo molecule into a
          carotenoid particle are described elsewhere herein.<br>
          <br>
          [0107] Cargo molecules incorporated into carotenoid particles
          may be delivered via the blood stream to a tissue which
          expresses carotenoid receptors. Tissues which express
          carotenoid receptors may include hepatocytes, liver, adrenal
          glands, lymphocytes, lymph nodes, prostate tissues and testis.
          This may be useful in providing targeted delivery of an cargo
          molecule to a specific tissue.<br>
          <br>
          [0108] An aspect of the invention provides the use of a
          carotenoid particle as described herein to deliver the cargo
          molecule to the blood stream via the gastrointestinal tract
          e.g. via oral administration.<br>
          <br>
          [0109] Carotenoid particles as described herein may be used in
          methods of treatment of the human or animal body, including
          prophylactic treatment (e.g. treatment before the onset of a
          condition in an individual to reduce the risk of the condition
          occurring in the individual; delay its onset; or reduce its
          severity after onset). The method of treatment may comprise
          administering the carotenoid particles to an individual in
          need thereof.<br>
          <br>
          [0110] Administration is normally in a “therapeutically
          effective amount” or “nutritionally effective amount”, this
          being sufficient to show benefit to the individual. Such
          benefit may be at least amelioration of at least one symptom
          or physiological parameter.<br>
          <br>
          [0111] Determining the optimal dosage for an individual will
          generally involve the balancing of the level of dietary or
          therapeutic benefit or efficacy associated with a particular
          dosage of cargo molecule against any risk or deleterious side
          effects associated with the dosage.<br>
          <br>
          [0112] The selected dosage level will depend on a variety of
          factors including, but not limited to, the nature and activity
          of the cargo molecule, the purpose of the treatment, the time
          of administration, the rate of excretion of the cargo
          molecule, the duration of the treatment, other drugs,
          compounds, and/or materials used in combination, and the age,
          sex, weight, condition, general health, and prior medical
          history of the individual. The amount of carotenoid particles
          will ultimately be at the discretion of the physician,
          dietician or other healthcare or wellness professional.<br>
          <br>
          [0113] Administration in vivo can be effected in one dose,
          continuously or intermittently (e.g., in divided doses at
          appropriate intervals) throughout the course of treatment.
          Single or multiple administrations can be carried out with the
          dose level and pattern being selected by the supervising
          professional.<br>
          <br>
          [0114] In general, a suitable dose of the cargo molecule is in
          the range of about 0.01 mg to about 1000 mg per kilogram body
          weight of the subject per day.<br>
          <br>
          [0115] For example, when cargo molecule is whey protein, the
          composition may be for administration at a dose of 0.1
          mg/Kg/day to 1000 mg/Kg/day of whey protein. When cargo
          molecule is resveratrol, the composition may be for
          administration at a dose of 0.1 mg/Kg/day to 100 mg/Kg/day of
          resveratrol. When cargo molecule is a statin, the composition
          may be for administration at a dose of 0.01 mg/Kg/day to 2
          mg/Kg/day of statin. When cargo molecule is isoflavone, the
          composition may be for administration at a dose of 0.1
          mg/Kg/day to 10 mg/Kg/day of isoflavone.<br>
          <br>
          [0116] Where the cargo molecule is a salt, an ester, prodrug,
          or the like, the amount administered is calculated on the
          basis of the parent compound and so the actual weight to be
          used is increased proportionately.<br>
          <br>
          [0117] Individuals suitable for treatment as described herein
          include individuals with a condition which is completely or
          partially (e.g. at least one symptom of the condition)
          ameliorated or alleviated by the cargo molecule, individuals
          at an increased risk of suffering from such a condition or
          patients who are predisposed to or at increased risk of
          suffering from such a condition, relative to the general
          population.<br>
          <br>
          [0118] The condition which is ameliorated or alleviated by the
          cargo molecule will depend on the nature of the cargo
          molecule.<br>
          <br>
          [0119] For example, a carotenoid particle comprising whey
          protein as described herein may be useful in treating
          Chlamydia infection, liver infections and/or in lowering
          cholesterol, for example in individual with elevated
          cholesterol levels or hypercholesterolemia.<br>
          <br>
          [0120] A carotenoid particle comprising a statin, may be
          useful in the treatment and/or prevention of cardiovascular
          disease, dementia, hypertension, cancer, including lung
          cancer, cataracts, and elevated cholesterol or
          hypercholesterolemia. Carotenoid particles comprising statins
          may also be useful in the treatment and/or prevention of other
          diseases and conditions which may be ameliorated by the
          pleotropic effects of statins, but for which statin treatment
          has not previously been use because of possible side effects,
          such as diabetes, in particular type II diabetes, and
          Alzheimer's disease.<br>
          <br>
          [0121] Carotenoid particles comprising resveratrol may be
          useful in the treatment and/or prevention of metabolic
          syndrome or one or more symptoms thereof, such as elevated
          cholesterol and/or triglycerides, diabetes, cardio- and
          cerebro-vascular disease, cancer, acute and chronic bacterial,
          fungal and viral infections, Alzheimer's and other
          neurodegenerative diseases, gastointestinal tract diseases,
          connective tissue disease, arthritis, and inflammatory
          conditions, as well as in anti-aging and beauty products and
          increasing wellness and longevity.<br>
          <br>
          [0122] Carotenoid particles comprising isoflavones may be
          useful in the treatment and prevention of metabolic syndrome
          or one or more symptoms thereof, such as elevated cholesterol
          and/or triglycerides, diabetes, cardio- and cerebro-vascular
          disease, cancer, Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative
          diseases, connective tissue diseases, and inflammatory
          conditions, as well as in anti-aging and beauty products and
          increasing wellness and longevity.<br>

          <b> </b><b>1. Effect of Whey Protein on Chlamydia</b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          [0144] The link between persistent Chlamydia infection and
          development of atherosclerosis has been has been established
          more than 25 years ago [1, 2]. Until recently a potential
          causative role of this infection has been occasionally
          questioned but remains unanswered. However, in the last year a
          number of publications started to shed some light on processes
          which may lay behind changes in lipid/cholesterol metabolism
          triggered by Chlamydia infection [3-5].<br>
          <br>
          [0145] In this study, we investigated whether whey protein has
          anti-bacterial and in particular anti-Chlamydia properties.<br>
          <br>
          <b>1.1 Methods</b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          <b> </b><b>Whey Protein</b><br>
          <br>
          [0146] 10 mg of 100% whey protein (Multipower) were dissolved
          in 1 ml of PBS. Two fold dilutions were prepared in RPMI and
          used for cell culture.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Cell Culture and Organisms</b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          [0147] McCoy cells were cultured in 5% CO2 in RPMI
          supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) and 2 mM
          glutamine. Cells were grown in 24 well plates with round glass
          coverslips. Strain L2/Bu434 of C. trachomatis was kindly
          provided by Dr. P. Saikku (University of Oulu, Finland).
          Chlamydial strain was initially propagated in McCoy cells and
          purified by Renografin gradient centrifugation as described
          [6]. Chlamydial titers were determined by infecting McCoy
          cells with 10-fold dilutions of thawed stock suspension.
          Purified elementary bodies (EB) with known titer were
          suspended in sucrose-phosphate-glutamic acid buffer and used
          as inoculums for McCoy cells.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Cells Infection</b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          [0148] McCoy plates were infected with C. trachomatis at
          multiplicity rate 2:1 in RPMI with 5% FBS and without
          cycloheximide and centrifuged for 1 hour at 1500 g at 25° C.
          Whey protein at concentration of 0.007-0.5 mg/ml was added to
          infected cells and plates were inoculated for 48 hours at 5%
          CO2 at 37° C.<br>

          were stained by direct immunofluoresence using FITC-conjugated
          monoclonal antibody against chlamydial lipopolysaccharide
          (NearMedic Plus, RF). Inclusion-containing cells were
          visualized using Nikon Eclipse 50i microscope fluorescence
          microscope at ×1350 magnification.<br>
          <br>
          <b>1.2 Results</b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          [0150] Whey protein was observed to have a dose dependent
          effect on Chlamydia inclusions in McCoy cells (FIG. 1).<br>

          <b>2. Production of Lycopene Particles</b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          [0151] The main principle for the production of lycopene
          particles (Lycosomes™) is to facilitate the incorporation of
          the selected cargo molecules into the lycopene matrix.<br>
          <br>
          [0152] This may be achieved by pre-solubilisation of lycopene
          and the cargo molecules in the same solvent, for example
          ethanol. Alternatively, the cargo molecules and lycopene may
          be dissolved in different solvents, for example, two different
          organic solvents, or an organic solvent and an oil.
          Preferably, the cargo molecules and lycopene are soluble
          either in full or in part in both solvents.<br>
          <br>
          [0153] On the second step lycopene solution should be
          blended/mixed with the solution(s) of the product(s), under
          conditions which allow for incorporation the molecules of the
          products, or their parts, into the lycopene matrix.<br>
          <br>
          [0154] Then the solvent(s) can be fully or partially
          evaporated which provides a residual substance in a dried, or
          a concentrated liquid form.<br>
          <br>
          [0155] Production of lycopene particles may also be achieved
          by completely or partially dissolving lycopene in a solvent
          and spraying it over, or mixing it with cargo molecules in a
          dry, powdered form. The dried particles of the cargo molecules
          are then captured by the lycopene droplets. The lycopene
          solvent may then be dried out or evaporated to produce solid
          particles.<br>
          <br>
          [0156] Alternatively, the mixture of solubilised lycopene and
          dried cargo molecules can stay in a form of suspension.<br>
          <br>
          [0157] Techniques applied for preparation of the lycosome
          products in the examples described in this application are
          described below. For example, WP-Lycosomes were prepared using
          organic solvent(s) on the initial stage then vegetable oil;
          Resveratrol-Lycosomes and LycoStatin were prepared by
          separately dissolving lycopene and Simvastatin in ethanol,
          mixing them in the chosen ration and subsequently evaporating
          the solvent from the mixture, or spray-drying the mixture;
          IS-Lycosomes were prepared by mixing an ethanol (full or
          partial) solution of lycopene with granulated soy-isoflavones.<br>
          <br>
          <b>3. Preparation of Whey Protein Lycosomes</b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          [0158] Lycopene particles incorporating whey proteins
          (WP-lycosomes) were produced as described in US20020107292.
          Briefly, 13.3 kg of whey protein isolate were dissolved in 330
          l of demineralized water and the mixture stirred for 6 hours
          at 25-30° C. Separately, 550 g of Lycored™ oleoresin (LycoRed
          Corp NJ USA) comprising 6% of lycopene, was mixed in 438 l of
          acetone and the mixture was stirred.<br>
          <br>
          [0159] The two solutions were subsequently mixed for 60 min at
          30° C. The final mixture was moderately heated and the acetone
          was driven off at a moderate pressure. Finally, water was
          partially driven off at a pressure of 40-50 mbar. An aqueous
          solution of 200 kg of whey protein isolate and of oleoresin
          was obtained, which was subsequently spray dried.<br>
          <br>
          [0160] Following spray drying, 186 g of soy lecithin in
          vegetable oil was added and mixed at 30° C. with the mass of
          the product.<br>
          <br>
          [0161] Lycopene particles incorporating reveratrol were
          prepared using a spray dry method. The formulation components
          were prepared in absolute ethanol.<br>
          <br>
          [0162] The material was prepared as follows:<br>
          <br>
          [0000] 5 g 99% trans-resveratrol<br>
          3.333 g Lyc-O-Mato 15% OS (i.e. 500 mg lycopene)<br>
          0.110 g lecithin<br>
          Ratio: 100 mg resveratrol:10 mg lycopene:2.2 mg lecithin<br>
          <br>
          [0163] 5 g resveratrol was dissolved in 100 ml absolute
          ethanol. 3.333 g Lyc-O-Mato 15% and 110 mg lecithin were
          dissolved in a separate volume of 100 ml absolute ethanol. The
          two solutions were mixed together and spray dried at 56° C.
          under nitrogen. The resulting powder was encapsulated as 203
          mg per size 0 capsule to give a dose of 120 mg resveratrol/12
          mg lycopene.<br>
          <br>
          [0164] In other experiments, 20 g of 99% trans-Resveratrol was
          dissolved in 100 ml of 95% of ethanol, and 35 mg of tomato
          oleoresin (10% lycopene) was dissolved separately in 95%
          ethanol. Then the both solvents were mixed for 60 mins at 30°
          C. at then spray-dried.<br>
          <br>
          [0165] Lycopene particles incorporating simvastatin were
          prepared using an evaporation method.<br>
          <br>
          [0166] 180 size 0 capsules were prepared, each contained 10 mg
          lycopene and 20 mg simvastatin along with 106 mg lecithin.<br>
          <br>
          [0167] An evaporation method was used and the resulting solid
          material was collected and ground in a mortar. The powder
          obtained was used for encapsulation. This method is comparable
          to rotogranulation of larger quantities of material in a
          commercial environment.<br>
          <br>
          [0168] The production method for this 180 dose batch was as
          follows:<br>
          <br>
          [0000] 19 g lecithin<br>
          48.5 g cornflour<br>
          3.6 g simvastatin<br>
          18 g Lyconattm 10% CWD (Vitatene Ltd) (i.e. 1.8 g lycopene)
          Total solids: 89.1 g<br>
          <br>
          [0169] The 18 g Lyconat 10% CWD was dispersed in 180 ml RO H2O
          and made up to 1,800 ml with absolute ethanol to give a
          dispersion in 90% ethanol. 3.6 g simvastatin was dissolved in
          90 ml ethanol, added to the lycopene dispersion in 90% ethanol
          and allowed to blend. 19 g lecithin was then added to the
          mixture and allowed to blend with the lycopene/simvastatin.
          The solvents were then evaporated.<br>
          <br>
          [0170] The resulting solid was collected, ground to a powder
          and encapsulated. 1 dose contained 495 mg in a size 0 capsule.
          Each dose was composed of 10 mg lycopene, 106 mg lecithin, 20
          mg simvastatin 269 mg cornflour, 90 mg starch from Lyconat 10%
          CWD<br>
          <br>
          [0171] In other experiments, 20 g of Simvastatin was dissolved
          in 100 ml of 95% of ethanol, and 7 g of lycopene from Vitatene
          was dissolved separately in 95% ethanol. Both solvents are
          mixed for 60 mins at 30° C. and then spray-dried.<br>
          <br>
          [0172] Lycopene particles incorporating soy isoflavones were
          prepared using an evaporation method.<br>
          <br>
          [0173] 550 g of Lycored™ oleoresin (LycoRed Corp NJ USA)
          comprising 6% of lycopene, was mixed in 438 l of acetone (95%
          ethanol might be used as an alternative) and the solution was
          stirred. The lycopene solution was then mixed with soy
          isoflavones in a powdered form and the mixture spray dried.<br>
          <br>
          [0174] In other experiments, lycopene particles incorporating
          soy isoflavones were produced by dissolving 550 g of Lycored™
          oleoresin (LycoRed Corp NJ USA) comprising 6% of lycopene, was
          mixed in 438 l of ethanal and separately dissolving soy
          isoflavones in water.<br>
          <br>
          [0175] The two solutions were subsequently mixed in the ratio
          of 50 g SI to 7 g or 14 g lycopene for 60 min at 30° C. The
          final mixture was moderately heated and the ethanol was driven
          off at a moderate pressure. Finally, water was partially
          driven off at a pressure of 40-50 mbar and the resultant
          solution spray dried.<br>
          <br>
          <b>4. Effects of Whey Protein Incorporated into Lycopene
            Particles</b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          [0176] To verify the potential effect of WP-Lycosomes™, a
          clinical trial was undertaken.<br>
          <br>
          [0177] 20 Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) patients who were
          positive for anti-Chlamydia IgG and hypercholesterolaemia were
          identified. These patients were randomised in 4 groups of 5
          patients, and each of them received daily either in:<br>
          <br>
          1&lt;st &gt;group—7 mg of lycopene supplement (in 70 mg of
          tomato oleoresin), or<br>
          2&lt;nd &gt;group—700 mg of WP, or<br>
          3&lt;rd &gt;group—mechanical mixture of 7 mg of lycopene (in
          70 mg of tomato oleoresin), and 70 mg of WP, or<br>
          4thgroup—WP-Lycosome comprising of 7 mg of lycopene (in 70 mg
          of tomato oleoresin) and 70 mg of WP.<br>
          <br>
          [0182] Serum anti-Chlamydia IgG and total serum cholesterol
          were measured after 4 weeks.<br>
          <br>
          [0183] The results show that WP itself has no ability to
          affect the level of Chlamydia infection in these patients, in
          terms of the specific IgG, or cholesterol concentration
          (Tables 1 and 2).<br>
          <br>
          [0184] Lycopene on its own has some ability to reduce
          Chlamydia infection, but its effect is only observed from the
          2&lt;nd &gt;week of its administration onwards and the total
          sero-negativity for all patients was only achieved in the last
          week of the trial.<br>
          <br>
          [0185] Mechanical mixing of lycopene with whey protein
          substantially diminished the ability of lycopene to reduce
          Chlamydia infection and 4 out of 5 patients (80%) remained
          sero-positive by the end of the trial (4 weeks).<br>
          <br>
          [0186] Lycopene on its own was observed to have a measurable
          effect on serum cholesterol. After 4 weeks it reduced
          cholesterol by 0.7 mmol/L. Mechanical mixing of lycopene with
          whey protein also substantially diminished this
          cholesterol-lowering effect.<br>
          <br>
          [0187] However, whey protein incorporated into lycopene
          particles, as described herein (WP-Lycosome™) displayed a
          profound and very rapid effect on both Chlamydia infection and
          cholesterol levels. Anti-Chlamydia IgG were cleared from all
          patients serum by the end of the 1&lt;st &gt;week of the
          trial. Cholesterol levels in patients treated with
          WP-Lycosomes displayed a significantly deeper reduction than
          that produced by lycopene on its own (by 2 mmol/L).<br>
          <br>
          [0188] These results show that, on top of “mild”
          anti-infective and cholesterol lowering properties of lycopene
          itself, there is a significant synergetic effect of the whey
          protein when it is incorporated into lycosomes.<br>
          <br>
          [0189] By contrast, mechanical mixing of whey protein and
          lycopene was found to inactivate the latter without increasing
          the activity of the former.<br>
          <br>
          [0190] These results show that incorporating whey protein into
          lycopene particles allows the anti-bacterial potential of the
          whey protein to be delivered to the liver.<br>
          <br>
          [0191] These cell culture tests show that whey protein has a
          direct anti-Chlamydia effect. This effect has not been shown
          for lycopene. The effects of the whey protein are
          concentration dependent. There is no increase in lycopene
          concentration in carotenoid particles relative to lycopene
          itself. This indicates that the effect is due to Whey protein.<br>
          <br>
          [0192] Although lycopene has been shown to reduce the symptoms
          of infection in vivo, this effect may be linked to its
          anti-oxidative and/or anti-inflammatory properties, and is
          generally evident after about 4 weeks. By contrast, whey
          protein acts much faster, and symptoms of Chlamydia infection,
          such as specific IgGs, disappear from the blood within days.<br>
          <br>
          <b>5. Effects of Resveratrol Incorporated into Lycopene
            Particles</b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          [0193] To verify the potential effect of lycosome technology
          on Resveratrol bioavailability a pharmacokinetic study on
          volunteers was undertaken.<br>
          <br>
          [0194] Resveratrol was incorporated into lycopene particles as
          described herein.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Clinical Protocol</b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          [0195] The group of 5 volunteers comprised of 2 female and 3
          male clinically healthy Caucasian persons, age between 23 and
          35 years. They were asked, before commencing this experiment,
          to go for 3-4 days “wash-out”, when consumption of any grape,
          wine, peanut, chocolate and other products which might contain
          them.<br>
          <br>
          [0196] In the morning of the experiment, one hour after light
          breakfast, volunteers were given 1 gelatine capsule containing
          100 mg of a trans-Resveratrol product, tRSV. Blood samples
          were taken from their median cubital or cephalic veins at the
          baseline point. Then, after administration of tRSV, their
          blood was taken again at the following time points: 30
          minutes, 1 hour, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 8 hours. After the 4 hours
          time point, volunteers had a light lunch which did not involve
          consumption of any grape, wine, peanut, chocolate and other
          products which might contain them.<br>
          <br>
          [0197] After taking blood its serum was separated, aliquoted
          and stored at -80° C. for further testing. The study was
          blinded, cross-over, and each participant was involved in
          testing of all three resveratrol products.<br>
          <br>
          [0000] tRSV Products<br>
          <br>
          [0198] Two separately manufactured batches of tRSV-Lycosome,
          and one batch of tRSV itself. Resveratrol for all these
          products was from the same batch of the same manufacturer.<br>
          <br>
          [0000] 5a. Study on Bioavailability of the Total Resveratrol<br>
          <br>
          [0199] The results of this study are presented in the table 3
          and table 4. These results demonstrate that, when resveratrol
          was administered in a form of lycosome, the level of two its
          major metabolites of, 3-sulfate and 4'-o-ß-D-glucuronide, was
          about 2-3 fold higher than when Resveratrol was administered
          on its own.<br>
          <br>
          [0200] A comparison of the pharmacokinetics of all main
          resveratrol metabolites is presented in the FIG. 2. These data
          show that administration of resveratrol within a lycopene
          particle (i.e. a lycosome) increases bioavailability relative
          to the same 100 mg dose of resveratrol on its own.<br>

          [0000] 5b. Study on Bioavailability of Unmodified
          Trans-Resveratrol<br>
          <br>
          [0201] A comparative pharmacokinetics of two trans-Resveratrol
          products, free form and embedded into lycopene clusters, is
          presented in the FIG. 3. A comparison of area under the curve,
          AUC, for two these products is presented in the Table 5. These
          results showed that incorporation of tRSV into lycopene was
          able to deliver this molecule in unmodified form, into the
          human blood, about 10 times more than when it was administered
          in free crystals.<br>

          <b>6. Effects of Statin Incorporated into Lycopene Particles</b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          [0202] 18 CHD patients with hypercholesterolaemia were
          randomised in 5 equal groups:<br>
          <br>
          in 1&lt;st &gt;group—patients received daily 1 capsule of 7 mg
          of lycopene supplement,<br>
          in 2&lt;nd &gt;group—patients received daily 1 capsule 20 mg
          of Simvastatin,<br>
          in 3&lt;rd &gt;group—patients received daily 1 capsule 40 mg
          of Simvastatin,<br>
          in 4thgroup—patients received daily 1 capsule 80 mg of
          Simvastatin,<br>
          in 5thgroup—patients received daily 1 capsule of
          Lycosome-Simvastatin (Lycostatin™), which was comprised of 7
          mg of lycopene and 20 mg of Simvastatin.<br>
          <br>
          [0208] Capsules were of the same colour and size and all
          ingredients for Lycostatin™ were from the same batches of the
          same manufacturers as for the separated products.<br>
          <br>
          [0209] The results of this trial are presented in FIGS. 4A to
          4C.<br>
          <br>
          [0210] Since in the lycopene control group there were
          significant changes in serum concentrations of tested lipid
          these results were not presented in the FIGS. 4A to 4C.<br>
          <br>
          [0211] At the same time all Simvastatin-contained products
          demonstrated significant ability to reduce total and
          LDL-cholesterol. There was clear dose-dependency in three
          groups which received free Simvastatin.<br>
          <br>
          [0212] However, in the group which received 20 mg, the
          smallest dose of the drug, but embedded into the lycopene
          clusters, there were most powerful reduction in concentrations
          of total and LDL-cholesterol. Both the rate and the level of
          this reduction were more profound even than in the group which
          received 80 mg of free Simvastatin.<br>
          <br>
          [0213] This provides indication that lycosome technology
          focuses drug delivery to the liver, which may potentially
          result in the reduction of the dose of the statin used, and
          consequently minimise its side effects.<br>
          <br>
          <b>7. Effects of Incorporation into Lycopene Particles of Soy
            Isoflavone</b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          [0214] Soy, particularly soy isoflavones, are one of the key
          components of the Oriental Diet responsible for the prevention
          of the development of Metabolic Syndrome and Diabetes.<br>
          <br>
          [0215] However, bioavailability and efficacy problems have
          been encountered in the extraction of isoflavones from their
          natural matrix and the development of dietary isoflavone
          supplements. Isolated isoflavones do not match the beneficial
          metabolic effects of the isoflavones within in a food matrix,
          even at the same dosages as the usual soy contained in the
          Oriental Diet.<br>
          <br>
          [0216] One option to address low bioavailability is to
          increase the dose of isolated isoflavone which is
          administered. Increased dosages may lead to significantly
          increased concentrations of isoflavones in the blood and
          subsequently in the tissues, which may in turn, activate
          estrogenic hormone receptors. Although estrogenic hormone
          receptor activation is already used as a part of
          hormone-replacement therapy in post-menopausal women,
          activation of these receptors would not be desirable in women
          of other age groups or in men.<br>
          <br>
          [0217] Another option is to focus the delivery of the
          isoflavones to the main metabolic organ (the liver) without
          increasing overall levels in the blood stream. Lycopene or
          other carotenoid compounds may be used as carriers to target
          the liver, which is rich with carotenoid receptors.<br>
          <br>
          [0218] Soy Isoflavones were incorporated into lycopene
          particles (SI-Lycosomes™) and their metabolic activity and
          pharmacokinetics were compared with those of two other
          products: SI on its own and SI mechanically mixed with
          lycopene.<br>
          <br>
          [0219] 42 patients with Metabolic Syndrome, elevated total
          cholesterol and/or triglycerides, were randomised in 3 equal
          groups:<br>
          <br>
          in 1&lt;st &gt;group—patients received daily 50 mg of SI,<br>
          in 2&lt;nd &gt;group—patients received daily of the mechanical
          mixture of 50 mg of SI and 7 mg of Lycopene, [SI+Lycopene],<br>
          in 3&lt;rd &gt;group—patients received SI-Lycosome™, 50 mg:7
          mg of SI and Lycopene respectively as a daily dose.<br>
          <br>
          [0223] 3 patients in the second group and 4 in the third left
          the trial for low compliance reasons. Therefore only 34
          patients managed to complete the trial.<br>
          <br>
          [0224] Capsules used in all three groups were of the same
          colour and size and all ingredients for SI-Lycosomes™ were
          from the same batches of the same manufacturers as for the
          separated products.<br>
          <br>
          [0225] Lipid parameters were measured and the results shown in
          Table 6. These results show that neither SI alone or
          mechanically mixed with lycopene had any significant effect on
          any analysed parameters of lipid metabolism in patient serum
          after 1 month of administration.<br>
          <br>
          [0226] Mechanical mixing of SI with lycopene resulted in the
          significnat reduction of the absorption of the isoflavones,
          which was registered both in this (FIG. 5), and in additional
          24 h pharmacokinetic trials (FIG. 6, 7).<br>
          <br>
          [0227] However, the same dose of SI delivered in a lycopene
          particle has a significant lowering effect on elevated
          triglycerides, total cholesterol, LDL and Apo-proteins.<br>
          <br>
          [0228] The observed metabolic effect of SI-Lycosome™ is
          unlikely to be due to the lycopene component itself because
          the increase in the lycopene concentration in serum of
          patients after 1 month of the administration of SI-Lycosome™
          was about 3 times lower than in the group of patients who
          received the same dose of lycopene but in the mechanical
          mixture with SI. The increment in the former group was 150
          ng/ml and in the latter 50 ng/ml (FIG. 8).<br>
          <br>
          [0229] FIGS. 9 and 10 show that incorporation of SI into
          lycopene particles does not create a new serum profile of
          isoflavones, compared with the free SI.<br>
          <br>
          [0230] Therefore, results herein show that the metabolic
          efficacy of SI is significantly boosted by incorporation into
          lycopene particles without increase of SI level sin blood.
          This liver response is possible due to the targetting of the
          liver by isoflavones incorporated into the carotenoid
          particle.<br>
          <br>
          [0231] Since carotenoids get absorbed to a significant degree
          via mechanical pathways, as independent physical particles
          and/or as a part of chylomicron, without their chemical
          modification, they can serve not only as a protective parcel
          but also as a protective currier or vehicle for the
          incorporated molecules or substances which could deliver them
          into the circulation in unmodified form.<br>
          <br>
          [0232] Therefore, if some molecules or compounds are captured,
          in full or in part, by lycopene molecules this can provide
          some protection, from such GIT factors as enzymatic
          degradation, oxidation, stomach acidity, gut flora, etc. The
          outcome of this could be an increase in absorption of these
          vulnerable substances and their delivery to the liver in their
          unmodified forms, i.e. increase in their bioavailability.<br>
