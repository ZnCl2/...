      <div align="center"><b> </b><big><b>Can Natural Remedies Help
            Treat COPD?</b><br>
        </big></div>
      <br>
      There is no shortage of natural remedies on the market today to
      treat, heal and cure our many ailments—chronic obstructive
      pulmonary disease (COPD) included. However, people living with
      COPD and other lung-related illnesses should be cautious when
      using these supplements to treat or manage their condition. That
      is according to a recent article published by Everyday Health.<br>
      <br>
      Unlike prescription drugs, natural remedies are not regulated by
      the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and have not undergone the
      extensive research and scrutiny that prescription drugs receive
      before entering the marketplace. Therefore, many doctors and
      researchers are still uncertain about the effectiveness of these
      supplements, as well as their side effects.<br>
      <br>
      Following are several natural supplements that have been said to
      remedy symptoms associated with COPD, as well as comments from
      experts on their effectiveness—or lack thereof.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Bromelain:</b> A supplement created from the enzymes found in a
      pineapple’s stem and juice, bromelain is said to reduce
      inflammation associated with COPD. However, according to the
      National Institutes of Health, scientific evidence to support this
      claim is lacking.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>Coenzyme Q10</b>: An antioxidant that is naturally produced
      by the body, coenzyme Q10 has been said to increase cell activity
      and ease inflammation in people with COPD. Researchers have found
      that people living with COPD have especially low levels of
      coenzyme Q10; however, studies have not proven that taking the
      supplement improves conditions.<br>
      <br>
      <b>L-Carnitine:</b> Typically produced by the body, L-carnitineis
      used to burn fat and boost energy. In COPD patients, this
      supplement appears to help strengthen muscles and improve
      endurance when exercising. Further, research has proven that those
      people who take L-carnitine supplements do significantly better
      during walking exercise programs.<br>
      <br>
      <b>N-acetylcysteine:</b> An antioxidant available as an
      over-the-counter dietary supplement, N-acetylcysteine has been
      researched for its role in breaking down the mucus that can clog
      the lungs of people living with COPD. To date, research has showed
      mixed results on the supplement’s effectiveness.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Antioxidant vitamins:</b> With properties of antioxidants,
      vitamins A, C and E have been said toimprove the lung function in
      people with COPD. Studies have shown that people living with COPD
      have low levels of these antioxidant-rich vitamins, and this
      deficiency can result in decreased pulmonary function. Further,
      studies have proven that COPD patients whose diets are rich in
      fruits and vegetables—a good source of vitamins A, C and E—saw
      improved lung function.<br>
      <br>
      Note that natural remedies cannot serve as the sole source of COPD
      treatment. Consult with your physician before adding these
      supplements to your diet to ensure they do not interfere with
      current treatment methods.<br>

      <div align="center"><big><b>Vitamin 'cure' for emphysema</b></big><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      A vitamin found in eggs and milk could hold the key to curing the
      potentially fatal lung disease emphysema, new research has
      revealed.<br>
      <br>
      British scientists have found that retinoic acid, a derivative of
      vitamin A, can reverse damage caused to the lungs by the
      previously incurable disease.<br>
      <br>
      Tests on mice have found that damaged lungs have been repaired to
      normal by the compound, which is already used to treat chronic
      acne.<br>
      <br>
      Trials are now being carried out to see if it could have similar
      success if used on humans.<br>
      <br>
      Emphysema is one of the most common respiratory diseases in
      Britain and causes progressive damage to the lungs, which can
      eventually kill. There is currently no cure.<br>
      <br>
      Early symptoms include breathlessness but sufferers can be left
      gasping for breath and reliant on oxygen.<br>
      <br>
      It usually affects older people and is generally the result of
      long-term damage to the lungs caused by smoking or exposure to
      other harmful substances.<br>
      <br>
      Professor Malcolm Maden, of the Medical Research Centre for
      Developmental Neurobiology at King's College, London, said his
      team's research held out "great hope" for the development of a
      treatment for emphysema in humans.<br>
      <br>
      He said the retinoic acid compound worked on tissue cells in the
      lungs, causing them to regenerate.<br>
      <br>
      Emphysema begins with the destruction of tiny air sacs (alveoli),
      which creates permanent "holes" in the walls of the lungs.<br>
      <br>
      As the air sacs are destroyed the lungs are able to transfer less
      and less oxygen to the bloodstream.<br>
      <br>
      Prof Maden said that during the tests on mice his compound made
      the alveoli grow back again until they returned to normal levels.<br>
      <br>
      He said: "We saw quite dramatic results. It is potentially hopeful
      for emphysema sufferers, and for premature babies who often suffer
      from loss of alveoli because of treatments given to stimulate lung
      growth."<br>
      <br>
      Clinical trials have begun in America to see if the treatment
      could be used on humans.<br>
      <br>
      A spokeswoman from the British Lung Foundation gave the research a
      cautious welcome.<br>
      <br>
      She said: "The BLF welcomes any interesting developments in
      research which may offer new options to patients with COPD (an
      umbrella term for chronic bronchitis and emphysema), a severely
      debilitating condition.<br>
      <br>
      "However, the BLF would like to examine this research to
      understand fully whether this might be a viable option in the
      future.<br>
      <br>
      "Currently, COPD is the fifth biggest killer worldwide and is the
      only major cause of death increasing in the UK."<br>
      <br>
      The research was based on a chemical compound of retinoic acid
      taken from Vitamin A, and not from a dietary intake of the
      substance.<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      Degenerative lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary
      disease (COPD) are common with huge worldwide morbidity.
      Anti-inflammatory drug development strategies have proved
      disappointing and current treatment is aimed at symptomatic
      relief. Only lung transplantation with all its attendant
      difficulties offers hope of cure and the outlook for affected
      patients is bleak. Lung regeneration therapies aim to reverse the
      structural and functional deficits in COPD either by delivery of
      exogenous lung cells to replace lost tissue, delivery of exogenous
      stem cells to induce a local paracrine effect probably through an
      anti-inflammatory action or by the administration of small
      molecules to stimulate the endogenous regenerative ability of lung
      cells. In animal models of emphysema and disrupted alveolar
      development each of these strategies has shown some success but
      there are potential tumour-inducing dangers with a cellular
      approach. Small molecules such as all-trans retinoic acid have
      been successful in animal models although the mechanism is not
      completely understood. There are currently two Pharma-sponsored
      trials in progress concerning patients with COPD, one of a
      specific retinoic acid receptor gamma agonist and another using
      mesenchymal stem cells.<br>

      <b><br>
      </b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Background</b><br>
      <br>
      Retinoids promote alveolar septation in the developing lung and
      stimulate alveolar repair in some animal models of emphysema.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Methods</b><br>
      <br>
      One hundred forty-eight subjects with moderate-to-severe COPD and
      a primary component of emphysema, defined by diffusing capacity of
      the lung for carbon monoxide (Dlco) [37.1±12.0% of predicted] and
      CT density mask (38.5±12.8% of voxels &lt;−910 Hounsfield units)
      [mean±SD] were enrolled into a randomized, double-blind,
      feasibility study at five university hospitals. Participants
      received all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) at either a low dose (LD)
      [1 mg/kg/d] or high dose (HD) [2 mg/kg/d], 13-cis retinoic acid
      (13-cRA) [1 mg/kg/d], or placebo for 6 months followed by a
      3-month crossover period.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Results</b><br>
      <br>
      No treatment was associated with an overall improvement in
      pulmonary function, CT density mask score, or health-related
      quality of life (QOL) at the end of 6 months. However,
      time-dependent changes in Dlco (initial decrease with delayed
      recovery) and St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (delayed
      improvement) were observed in the HD-ATRA cohort and correlated
      with plasma drug levels. In addition, 5 of 25 participants in the
      HD-ATRA group had delayed improvements in their CT scores that
      also related to ATRA levels. Retinoid-related side effects were
      common but generally mild.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Conclusions</b><br>
      <br>
      No definitive clinical benefits related to the administration of
      retinoids were observed in this feasibility study. However, time-
      and dose-dependent changes in Dlco, CT density mask score, and
      health-related QOL were observed in subjects treated with ATRA,
      suggesting the possibility of exposure-related biological activity
      that warrants further investigation.<br>

      <br>
      In emphysema, the lung cannot spontaneously regenerate lost
      alveolar tissue. Treatment with retinoic acid (RA) in rodent
      models of emphysema induces alveolar regeneration. However, some
      animal studies have failed to show regeneration when using
      different species and strains. We have previously shown that
      dexamethasone (Dex) treatment of newborn TO outbred strain mice
      permanently disrupts alveolar development. Later RA treatment
      restores alveolar architecture to normal. To determine whether
      this model of alveolar regeneration is strain specific, our
      protocol was repeated with two new outbred mouse strains. ICR and
      NIHS mice received Dex from Postnatal Days 4 to P15 (P4– P15).
      From P46 to P57, mice received RA (2 mg/kg) or vehicle. An
      additional ICR group received 5× RA (10 mg/kg) from P46 to P57.
      Control groups received vehicle at both treatment points. All mice
      were killed at P90 and lung morphology analyzed. Dex-treated ICR
      and NIHS mice showed increased mean alveolar chord length (Lm) and
      reduced alveolar surface area (SA) and SA/lung volume (SA/LV)
      compared with controls. RA-treated NIHS mice showed return of Lm,
      SA, and SA/LV toward control values, indicating alveolar
      regeneration. ICR RA group mice did not regenerate, but 5× RA mice
      showed Lm, SA, and SA/LV values consistent with alveolar
      regeneration. In conclusion, the Dex-treated mouse model of
      emphysema is robust and repeatable in different strains.
      RA-induced alveolar regeneration is not a strain-specific
      phenomenon. RA dose threshold for inducing alveolar regeneration
      is higher in ICR mice, suggesting a difference in retinoid
      pharmacokinetics between strains. These results provide a possible
      explanation for previous failed studies of RA-induced alveolar
      regeneration.<br>

      Endogenous retinoids have been implicated in alveologenesis in
      both the rat and the mouse, and exogenous retinoic acid (RA) can
      reverse or partially reverse experimental emphysema in adult rat
      and mouse models by an unknown mechanism. In this study, we
      examine the cellular and molecular biology of retinoid signaling
      during alveologenesis in the mouse. We describe the temporal and
      spatial expression of the retinoid binding proteins CRBP-I,
      CRBP-II, and CRABP-I using RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. We
      identify the retinoic acid receptor isoforms RAR-a1, RAR-ß2,
      RAR-ß4, and RAR-?2 and describe their temporal and spatial
      expression using RT-PCR and in situ hybridization. We demonstrate
      that both retinoid binding proteins and RAR isoforms are
      temporally regulated and found within the alveolar septal regions
      during alveologenesis. These data support a role of dynamic
      endogenous RA signaling during alveolar formation. <br>
