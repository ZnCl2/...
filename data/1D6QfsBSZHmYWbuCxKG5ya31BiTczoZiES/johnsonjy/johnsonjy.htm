      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract</span> -- Changes in the
      energy content of dipolar substances are produced by exposure to a
      concentrated electromagnetic field having one or more frequencies
      corresponding to wavelengths between 3 mm. and 6 metres
      approximately and equal to characteristic periods of the
      substances treated. The process applies to naturally dipolar
      substances and to those in which dipoles can be induced by a
      field. The characteristic periods of the substances are of three
      kinds depending respectively on (1) the relaxation time of the
      dipoles when orientated by the field, (2) the natural
      oscillation-period of the dipoles, (3) the term-difference
      frequencies of the atoms. They are associated with anomalous
      variations in the optical and dielectric properties and can be
      found by examining those properties in a field of varying
      frequency. They can be varied within limits by changing the
      temperature, pressure, concentration, &amp;c., and may thus be
      adjusted to correspond exactly with a field of approximately
      correct frequency. The fields may be standing ones produced
      between conductors such as concentric tubes or the plate
      resonators described in Specification 417,564, or radiated fields
      concentrated by reflectors. They may comprise several different
      frequencies and constant electrostatic fields may be superimposed
      on them. The exposure may be continuous or intermittent and
      different frequencies may be applied in succession. The invention
      is not concerned with the production of merely transitory effects
      and temperature changes, but with more permanent physical and
      chemical effects of which the following are examples:-- Colloidal
      dispersions and emulsions are stabilised or further dispersed by
      short exposure but prolonged treatment produces coagulation. An
      agar-agar gel exposed to a field of 116 cm. wavelength increases
      in mobility after 10 minutes and becomes more viscous after
      several hours. Crystallization is stimulated by the use of a
      varying field. Preservation of organic materials is effected
      preferably by intermittent exposure, e.g. veal after 3 minutes
      treatment with a field comprising four selected frequencies
      remains fresh for 2 weeks, or longer if further exposure to a
      weaker field is given for 5 minutes in each hour. Milk and apple
      juice may be similarly treated. Medical diagnosis and treatment.
      Cell-division may be stimulated and other beneficial effects
      produced in living bodies. The method of determining the
      characteristic frequencies of the constituents of a living body
      provides a means of diagnosis. Fermentation processes and other
      processes involving bacteria may be modified by influencing the
      bacteria or their nutrient medium. Germination of seeds may be
      accelerated. Bean seeds previously swollen and exposed for 30 sec.
      to suitable fields germinate twice as fast as untreated seeds.
      Electrets may be produced by subjecting a fluid dielectric to a
      field and then solidifying it by freezing, evaporation, or
      coagulation. Medicines for internal and external use may have
      electrets incorporated in them, the electrical energy being
      released upon their application. A plaster comprising euphorbium
      powder, fine resin, yellow wax, and turpentine may be exposed at
      85 DEG C. to a field of 235 cm. wavelength and then cooled to 15
      DEG C. Disinfecting pastilles comprising beeswax and gums and the
      usual drugs may be similarly treated. Photographic plates may be
      rendered more sensitive especially in the red and infra-red by
      exposure to the fields. Chemical reactions may be promoted and
      facilitated. Examples are: (1) the conversion of acetylene, steam,
      and ozone into acetic acid and acetaldehyde without a catalyst;
      (2) the drying of lacquers and varnishes; (3) the consolidation of
      styrol; (4) the hardening of Bakelite; (5) the polymerization of
      isoprene; (6) the vulcanization of rubber. Artificial silk may be
      stabilized by treatment as it leaves the spinning
      nozzle.ALSO:Chemical reactions are promoted or accelerated by
      exposure of dipolar substances to a concentrated electromagnetic
      field having one or more frequencies corresponding to wave lengths
      between 3 mm. and 6 metres approximately and equal to
      characteristic periods of the substances treated. The process
      applies to naturally dipolar substances and to those in which
      dipoles can be induced by a field. The characteristic periods of
      the substances are of three kinds depending respectively on (1)
      the relaxation time of the dipoles when orientated by the field;
      (2) the natural oscillation-period of the dipoles; (3) the
      term-difference frequencies of the atoms. They are associated with
      anomalous variations in the optical and dielectric properties and
      can be found by examining these properties in a field of varying
      frequency. The fields may be standing ones produced between
      conductors such as concentric tubes or the plate resonators
      described in Specification 417,564, [Group XL], or radiated fields
      concentrated by reflectors. Several different frequencies may be
      applied simultaneously or in succession and either constantly or
      intermittently, and constant electrostatic fields may be
      superimposed on them. The following examples of reactions are
      mentioned, viz.:-- Synthetic rubber is produced by polymerization
      of isoprene. Phenol-aldehyde condensation products, styrol,
      &amp;c. are hardened. The drying of lacquers, varnishes &amp;c. is
      accelerated. Acetaldehyde and acetic acid are obtained by the
      reaction of acetylene, steam, and ozone without a catalyst.
      Artificial silk is hardened by treatment of the material as it
      leaves the spinning nozzles. The product shows increased
      resistance to wear. ALSO: The germination of seeds is accelarated
      by exposure to a concentrated electromagnetic field having one or
      more frequencies corresponding to wave lengths between 3 mm. and 6
      meters approximately and equal to characteristic periods of the
      substances treated. The characteristic periods of the substances
      are associated with anomalous variations in the optical and
      dielectric properties and can be found by examining these
      properties in a field of varying frequency. The fields may be
      standing one produced between conductors such as concentric tubes
      or the plate resonators described in Specification 417,564, [Group
      XL], or radiated fields concentrated by reflectors. Several
      different frequencies may be applied simultaneously or in
      succession and either constantly or intermittently and constant
      electrostatic fields may be superimposed on them. According to an
      example, bean seeds previously swollen are treated for 30 seconds
      at 35 DEG C. with a field comprising wave lengths of 28 cm. and 87
      cm. In four weeks they grow twice as much as untreated seeds.
      ALSO: Changes in the energy content of dipolar substances are
      produced by exposure to a concentrated electromagnetic field
      having one or more frequencies corresponding to wavelengths
      between 3 mm. and 6 metres approximately and equal to
      characteristic periods of the substances treated. The process
      applies to naturally dipolar substances and to those in which
      dipoles can be induced by a field. The characteristic periods of
      the substances are of three kinds depending respectively on (1)
      the relaxation time of the dipoles when orientated by the field;
      (2) the natural oscillation-period of the dipoles; (3) the

      I, James Yate Johnson... do hereby declare the nature of this
      invention ( which was communicated to me from abroad by Ternion
      Aktiengesellschaft, of Glarus, Switzerland ), to be as follows :--<br>
      <br>
      Among the properties of substances there are several which are
      dependent on the frequency of the electromagnetic oscillations
      used for observation. Among such properties may be mentioned for
      example speed of transmission, absorption, rotation of plane of
      polarization and dielectric constant. The term used in these cases
      is dispersion of the properties concerned. In order to explain
      this phenomenon, Sellmeier (1871) and later Helmholtz, Ketteler
      and others developed the theory that with respect to the period of
      oscillation employed the substances can no longer be regarded as
      cpontinual, but rather they must be regarded as more or less
      rigidly coupled aggregates of oscillators. As oscillators
      according to modern conception of the construction of materials
      may be mentioned the combined electrons, the combined atoms and
      the dipolar molecules. Since these particles are carriers of
      electric charges, they are set in oscillation under the influence
      of external electrical alternating fields, as for example the
      electromagnetic radiation field. They absorb energy from the
      applied alternating field. The excitation is especially strong and
      the absorption of energy therefore especially great in the case of
      resonance. Simultaneously with this there takes place a sudden
      change in all those properties which are connected with the
      energetic alternating action between oscillator and external
      oscillation, for example the above-mentioned properties. A typical
      resonance curve is shown in Figure 1. The oscillation frequencies
      are given as abscissae and the ordinates are the corresponding
      strengths of the absorption of energy (dotted) and the values of
      any one of the dispersion properties, as for example the
      dielectric constant (full line). The region of the sudden change
      is termed the anomalous dispersion region, in constrast to the
      regions of normal dispersion on the branches of the curve lying
      further to the outside.<br>
      <br>
      In many cases, for exampe when it is desired especially to
      emphasize the electrical nature of the alternating action the term
      polarization of the substance is also used, in order to express
      the polar structure of the oscillators.<br>
      <br>
      In order to be able to state into which forms the absorbed energy
      is converted, it is necessary to bring the conception of
      polarization into a somewhat more precise form. It is preferably
      subdivided into:<br>
      <br>
      1. an electron polarization, i.e., an influencing of the electron
      shells which build up and hold together the atoms;<br>
      <br>
      2. an atomic polarization, i.e., a displacement of the position of
      the atoms which build up the molecule, and<br>
      <br>
      3. an orientation polarization, i.e., a change in the relative
      positions of the molecules themselves.<br>
      <br>
      The energies to be employed for the different polarizations are of
      quite different orders of size. The greatest energy for
      polarization is required by the electrons, the least by the
      molecules. Now according to the quantum theory the following
      equation holds good:<br>
      <br>
      energy = <span style="font-style: italic;">h.v</span><br>
      <br>
      in which <span style="font-style: italic;">h</span> represents
      the Planck elementary quantum and <span style="font-style:
        italic;">v</span> represents the frequecny of oscillation of the
      electromagnetic rays. Thus the greater the energy to be introduced
      into the particles of matter, the greater must be the frequency of
      oscillation of the rays, and the shorter therfore must be their
      wavelength. Accordingly the resonance positions of electron
      polarization lie in the region of the Roentgen, ultraviolet and
      light rays, the resonance positions of atomic polarization lie in
      the region of the infrared spectrum and the resonance positions of
      orientation polarization lie still further beyond in the region of
      the radio short and ultra-short waves. Those which have been best
      investigated are the absorption spectra in the region of visible
      light. It is known therefrom that the absorbed light causes no
      appreciable physical or chemical changes in the irradiated
      substance. it is to the greater part radiated again as such. A
      part is converted into heat, another part may serve, with a change
      in its wavelength, to excite atomic oscilaltions (Raman effect)
      and in comparatively rare cases the rays of light passing into the
      substance give rise to chemical changes (photochemical reaction).
      The rareness of photochemical reactions is especially prominent.
      The behavior in the IR region and in the UV region is very
      similar.<br>
      <br>
      Only a little is known of the behavior of substances with respect
      to waves having a wavelength of from the IR to several meters. The
      anomalous dispersion bands, especially, have still scarcely been
      exactly investigated. The region of waves which has hitherto been
      well investigated lies above about 2 meters, which is, generally
      speaking, outside the anomalous dispersion bands. The dielectric
      polarization is only slightly noticeable therein. Energy is
      absorbed only slightly and since it is moreover almost completely
      converted into heat, is generally unsatisfactory, so that
      dielectric losses are spoken of. Only in a few special cases can
      this polarization be usefully employed&nbsp; (diathermy, Kerr
      celss).<br>
      <br>
      My foreign correspondents have now found that dipolar substances
      and substances containing the same behave in a thoroughly new and
      unforeseen manner when they are subjected to the action of an EM
      radiation field which oscillates mainly or wholly in one or more
      frequencies of the said substances in the region of waves of from
      the infred to several meters in wavelength. The term "natural
      frequency" is intended to mean the range of frequency of the
      anomalous dispersion. Especially profiound influences take place
      by the action of alternating fields which correspong to the
      natural frequencies of the substance which lie below 2 meters. By
      this action, an alteration in the energy content of the dipolar
      substance takes place which becomes strikingly noticeable in an
      increased reactivity and an orientation of the molecules. The
      orientation of the molecules renders the substances double
      refractive. This double refraction also effects a rotation of the
      plane of a ray of polarized light passed therethrough.<br>
      <br>
      Before entering into details of this phenomeon, some observations
      may be made on the determination of the natural frequencies. From
      the previously described connection between resonance frequency
      and anomalous dispersion position it results that the latter is a
      suitable indicator for the resonance frequency. It is only
      necessary to follow the frequency dependence of a constant of a
      substance suitable for the range of waves concerned up to the
      anomalous position. The dielectric constants are especially
      suitable for this purpose. My foreign correspondents have found
      that there are two sharply separated kinds of anomalous dispersion
      which may be differentiated as friction dispersion and resonance
      dispersion. Friction dispersion appears in all non-conducting
      dielectrics. With <span style="font-weight: bold;">water</span>
      for example it is shown in Figure 2, wherein the curves shows the
      course of the dielectric constant when using varying wavelengths
      for observation, and exhibiting a <span style="font-weight:
        bold;">band of anomalous dispersion at a wavelength of about 1.5
        centimeters</span>.<br>
      <br>
      The course of such functions has already been theoretically
      explained by Debye and brought into mathematical form. In the
      description, the <span style="font-weight: bold;">time lag</span>
      appears as a substantial constituent of the conception, <span
        style="font-style: italic;">i.e., the time which the molecules
        require in order to come into equilibrium with an external field</span>.
      The time lag is, inter alia, dependent on the internal friction
      constant and the <span style="font-weight: bold;">temperature</span>.
      In order to tune the irradiation alternating field&nbsp; and the
      natural fequency of the substance to be treated to each other, the
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">external frequency</span> may be
      altered while keeping the time lag constant until resonance is
      attained, or the <span style="font-weight: bold;">time lag may be
        altered</span> while keeping the external frequency constant.
      The latter may be conveniently attained by altering the internal
      friction, i.e., <span style="font-weight: bold;">by alteration of
        the concentration and/or temperature</span>.<br>
      <br>
      Resonance dispersion appears in all conducting dielectrics, i.e.,
      in electrolytes. it is of special importance for the processes in
      living organisms. its curve differs very clearly from that of the
      friction dispersion, as may be seen from Figure 3 of the
      accompanying drawing. The band of anonmalous dispersion is very
      small and sharply pronounced, frequently scarcely wider than <br>
      <br>
      delta lambda = 2 / 100 lambda.<br>
      <br>
      It can consequently be very readily overlooked. <span
        style="font-style: italic;">This hitherto unknown dispersion
        anomaly is connected with the alternating action of the ions</span>.<br>
      <br>
      In order to determine the natural frequency of dipolar substances
      and to alter the energy content of these substances, thereby
      allowing the technical effects hereinafter described to be
      obtained, electromagnetic fields in part of relatively small field
      strength but also in part of great field strength are necessary...<br>
      <br>
      In order to strengthen the action of the electromagnetic fields
      thus produced they may be directed and concentrated by known
      means. This is especially of importance in cases when it is
      desired to carry out the action only in certain zones. A direction
      of the field may be effected by reflectors and a concentration may
      be effected between Hertz parabolic mirrors. Extremely
      concentrated fields may be produced by a new apparatus which is
      the object of the copending application No. 11,628/34 ( Serial no.
      417,564 ). This describes a plate oscillator which resembles a
      condenser in its external form, but not in its electric behavior.
      In one of the modes of execution which are adequate for use in
      practice, it consists of two plates oppositely arranged. By reason
      of the distributed self-induction and distributed capacity the
      plate oscillator has electric resonances which appear at very high
      frequencies.<br>
      <br>
      In order to bring into action the electromagnetic alternating
      fields corresponding to one or more natural frequencies of the
      dipolar substance, the dipolar substance is brought, according to
      the desired intensity of the action, into the EM alternating field
      of corresponding frequency which may be undirected, or dirrected (
      e.g. by reflectors ), or concentrated ( e.g. by Hertz mirrors),
      or, if a specially intense action is necessary, the dipolar
      substance is exposed to the stationary alternating field in thin
      layers between the electrodes of the plate oscillator.<br>
      <br>
      In cases when a substance has several natural frequencies in teh
      range concerned, such as is the case mainly in electrolyte
      mixtures, a tuning may also beeffected with the aid of means known
      in high frequency technique...<br>
      <br>
      The energy supplied by resonance excitation varies wither the
      intermolecular or intramolecular equilibrium of the substance
      depending on the radiated natural frequency or on the intensity
      thereof. In the case of <span style="font-weight: bold;">colloids</span>
      for example the influencing of the intermolecular fields of force
      results in a change in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">size
        of particles ( conversion from the sol into the gel conditions
        or vice versa, floculation, change in the ciscosity or
        consuctivity and the like )</span> or in a change in the degree
      of hydration ( influencing of the ageing phenomena of colloids, as
      for example silica gel, albumens, pectins and similar colloids).<br>
      <br>
      In order to illustrate the effects taking place in colloidal
      solutions by irradiation with electromagnetic alternating fields
      having a frequency which corresponds with a natural frequency of
      the orradiated solution, an experiment carried out with a <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">colloidal solution of gold is given
        below. The solution showed a maximum resonance with a wavelength
        of 18.6 cm and at about 20* C.</span> The solution was
      interposed in a layer 1 millimeter in thickness between the
      circular plates of a <span style="font-weight: bold;">plate
        oscillator with a plate diameter of about 6.2 cm was at a
        wavelength of 18.6 cm</span>... After acting on the solution for
      an hour, the original red color of the solution changed to orange,
      a change in color which as is well known indicated a <span
        style="font-style: italic;">diminution in the size of the
        colloid particles. By intensive irradiation for longer periods
        an opposite effect is observed, a floculation takign place</span>.<br>
      <br>
      For further illustration an experiment carried out with <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">agar-agar solution</span> the
      resonance position of which lay at a <span style="font-weight:
        bold;">wavelength of 116 cm</span> may be referred to. These
      longer waves require plates of considerably larger diameter for
      the purpose of tuning the plate oscillator. Wth the plates 1 cm
      apart, plates having a diameter of nearly 30 cm are necessary, as
      determined by calculation and confirmed by experiment in order
      that the fundamental wave of the oscillator has a wavelength of
      116 cm. In order to avoid these somewhat troublesome dimensions,
      the experiment was carried out in a plate-oscillator in which the
      distance between the plates was reduced from 1 cm to about 0.5 cm,
      whereby it was possible to employ circular plates havin a diameter
      of 20 cm. The fine tuning of the oscillator system to the dipolar
      layer ( having a thickness of 1 mm and a natural frequency of 116
      cm ) interposed between the plates was effected by regulating the
      distance between the plates... After a short time the solution
      became more mobile,nad after irradiation for several hours the
      opposite effect occurred and the solution became more viscous.<br>
      <br>
      The effects in the case of colloids of living organisms are
      especially striking, where they are equivalent to a preservation.
      For example by suitable dosing of the intensity of radiation&nbsp;
      the natural decomposition processes, which always commense with a
      decrease in the energy content and a change in the colloidal
      state, may be suspended. For example if <span style="font-weight:
        bold;">fruit</span> of all kinds be irradiated with the natural
      frequency of their expressed&nbsp; <span style="font-weight:
        bold;">juices ( on an average 40 cm with slight deviations )</span>
      or <span style="font-weight: bold;">animal products with the
        natural frequency of their serums ( on the average from 85 to 95
        cm )</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold;">a preservation
        for weeks at ordinary temperature is obtained</span>, whereas
      the same products without irradiation are spoilt within a few days
      under otherwise identical conditions. It is remarkable that the
      natural aroma is completely retained in the case of
      radiation-preservation. If the intensity of radiation exceeds the
      degree necessary for preservation, profound chemical changes take
      place.<br>
      <br>
      By the action of EM alternating fields of frequencies which
      correspond to one or more of the natural frequencies of the blood
      serum, profound effects may be produced in men and animals.<br>
      <br>
      Serums are thoroughly complex liquids in which is present a large
      number of dipolar substances in more or less great dilution. The
      solvent is water. The position and strength of the anomalous
      dispersion bands varies according to the nature and concentration
      of the dipolar substances. Experiments have shown that differences
      in the position of the resonance positions occur not only in
      different serums but also in serums taken from different
      individuals. In fact even with one and the same individual, the
      strength and number of the absorption bands differ according to
      the prevailing condition of change-of-matter. Since the absorption
      bands, espcially in the case of dipolar substances which are only
      present in small concnetration, are in part extremely sharp (half
      value widths of less than 5 %) they readily escape observation
      when normal pure electrical methods are employed. The position of
      the resonance points herein described has been found for example
      by observing the alteration of the intensity of a beam of
      polarized light penetrating the influenced substances.<br>
      <br>
      In the said manner the serum of a a test person was investigated.
      At a temperature of <span style="font-weight: bold;">37* C</span>
      an especially strong pronounced resonance position was established
      at a wavelength of about <span style="font-weight: bold;">90 cm</span>.
      Between this wavelength and the shortest dipolar resonance bands
      occurring in the serum, that of chemically pure water which lies
      at a wavelength of about 1.28 cm there are a large number of
      characteristic resonance positions the accurate knowledge of which
      might give a comprehensive conception of the state of health of
      the person concerned. Resonance positions above a wavelength of
      about 1 meter are according to observation made up to the present
      rather wide. The supply of oscillatory energy from these long
      ranges of waves leads chiefly to increases in temperature, but not
      to the quite specific einfluences which are characteristic for
      most of the resonance positions below a wavelength of 1 meter. By
      irradiation with frequencies corresponding to the sharply
      prodounced resonance positions, it is possible, as experiments
      have proved, to cause quite definitive reproduceable effects. <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">The alterations of energy in the body
        lead to advantageous effects or also to marked injury</span>.<br>
      <br>
      If it is intended specifically to act on foreign bodies in the
      serum, as for example bacteria, there are two possibilities;
      either the irradiation is effected in the frequency which
      corresponds to a strongly pronounced absorption position owing to
      the presence of foreign bodies in the serum and thus the nutrient
      medium and therefore, for example, the living conditions of the
      bacteria are altered, or the irradiation is effected in
      frequencies which correspond to the natural frequencies of the
      dipolar substance from which the bacteria are built up.<br>
      <br>
      Purely chemical reactions can also be enforced which otherwise
      only proceed under the influence of heat or of catalysts. For
      example isoprene is converted into a rubberlike polymerization
      product, rubber solutions are vulcanized in the presence of
      sulfur, Bakelite A adn B are converted into Bakelite C, varnishes
      and laquers dry more quickly, acetylene combines with water to
      form acetaldehyde which in the presence of oxidizing agents, as
      for example ozone, is immediately converted into acetic acid, and
      so forth.<br>
      <br>
      A further effect to be observed by the action of resonant
      eledctromagnetic alternating fields is that the dipolar molecules
      are orientated. Such orientation of dipolar molecules&nbsp; which
      ingeneral are in the disordered thermal equilibrium, could
      hitherto only be produced by the action of an external
      electrostatic field which due to the smallness of the dimensions
      of the molecules must be very strong, in order to exert an
      appreciable torque on the molecules and thereby orientate them.
      For the orientation of dipolar molecules by means of electrostatic
      fields voltages are necessary which nearly reach the disruptive
      strength of the dielectrics and thus are of the order of about
      between 100,000 and 200,000 volts. Consequently an oritentation of
      conductive dielectrics by means of electrostatic fields is not
      possible since in such dielectrics the fields break down.<br>
      <br>
      In contradistinction thereto, conductive as well as non-conductive
      dipolar substances can easily be orientated by means of resonant
      electromagnetic alternating fields. At first glance this appears
      to be improbable since it is to be assumed that the molecules will
      change periodically their direction in phase with the alternating
      field or rotate in the same phase and not arrange in the preferred
      position. This assumption would be correct, if the molecules did
      not exert directed forces on each other. Such directed forces,
      however, are existent as results from the fact that without any
      external influences the single molecules orietnate themselves to
      some extent on their neighboring molecules while passing through
      the sphere of influence of the latter as can be observed in x-ray
      spectrograms. The same forces are also the cause of the formation
      of associates of molecules as can be observed in many cases, for
      example of pairs of molecules, as in the case of acetic acid,
      shoals of molecules as with azoxyanisole, or the accumulation of
      dipolar molecules around an ion as is the case with hydrated ions.
      Such associates are liable to form groups by interlocking.<br>
      <br>
      The formation of such associates essentially depends on the
      frequency of collisions of two molecules, the greatness of the
      intermolecular forces and the probability of the collision of two
      molecules in a positin favorable for the formation of associates.
      By setting the molecules in uniform oscillation by means of a
      resonant eM alternatig field the probability of the molecules
      colliding with each other in a position favorable for the
      formation of associates and the permation os such associates and
      groups of interlocked associates is essentially increased. Such
      associates and groups are no longer capable of following the phase
      of the applied alternating field, but can only exert tilting
      oscillations about a position determined by the applied alternting
      field. This, howver, is equal to an orientation of the molecules
      throughout the whole mass. An electrostatic ( ES ) field acting
      simultaneously with the alternating field and in parallel
      therewith has no great influence on the orientation process for
      the reason already stated. It may, however, help to increase the
      percentage of orientated molecules and to keep a body of molecules
      which have once been oriented, in the ordered condition, even when
      the alternating field is withdrawn, since it is no longer
      necessary to orientate a body of disordered molecules requiring a
      high voltage, but prevent a body of orientated molecules
      substantially supporting itself to fall back into the disordered
      condition. For this purpose an ES field is sufficient, the voltage
      of which is from 10 to 20 times smaller than is necessary to
      produce such orientation by means of an ES field alone.<br>
      <br>
      After withdrawing the applied resonant alternating field by which
      the orientation is produced, the disordered thermal equilibrium is
      produced again. The orientation may be maintained, however, if the
      dipolar substnace, while being orientated, be converted into a
      solid state the orientation being thus "frozen in", so to speak.
      This may be attained by solidifying an orientated gelatinizable
      dipolar substance or a gelatinizable liquid in which an orientated
      dipolar substance is dissolved, or by cooling an orientated
      dipolar substance below its melting point, or by evaporating the
      solvent in which an orientated solid dipolar substance has been
      dissolved. Such "freezing in" of an orientated substance in the
      said manner can only effected while maintaining the resonant EM
      alternating field alone, if the solidification takes place without
      change of temperature or concnetration, that is to say if during
      the solidification the alternating field and molecules do not come
      out of phase by change of the time lag. This is the case if the
      solidification be effected by gelatinization at constant
      temperature. When producing solidfication by cooling or
      evaporating of a solvent the orientation must be maintained by
      means of an electrostatic field since during the solidifying
      process the time lag of the molecules is changed. In the latter
      case the EM alternating field by which the orientation is produced
      may be withdrawn. The maintenance of an orientation proceeds
      especially well when particularly long-chained molecules (grerat
      time lag) are embedded in an amorphously solidifying melt.
      Mixtures of paraffin and wax or glycerine with wax or colophony
      were investigated in this way. The value of the mean surface
      density of the permanent orientation charge amounted for exmaple
      to 0.5 to 2.0 x 10^9 coulombs per square cm positive.<br>
      <br>
      A substance have a frozen-in orientation of its molecules is more
      rich in energy than the same substance in natural thermal
      equilibrium. When "thawed" it gives up again this excess of
      energy, and, indeed, in the form of radiations of the same
      wavelength as those with which it was origianlly orientated. This
      behavior may be used in order to supply to animal bodies dosed
      amounts of energy of a natural frequency which is active in the
      organism, as for example by allowing an aqueous gelatin the
      natural frequency of the serum to solidify while orientated and
      then to incorporate it into the body in this form...<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Complete Specification</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      This invention relates to a process for altering permanently as
      well as temporarily the energy content of dipolar substances by
      exposing them to rapidly oscillating EM fields.<br>
      <br>
      By dipolar substances are meant, not only those that contain
      dipoles in the absence of an electric field, but also those in
      which dipoles are induced when the substance is exposed to a
      suitable electric field. Dipole is used in the sense familiar in
      connection with the well known work of Debye, as expounded (for
      example) in his book entitled "Polar Molecules" (1929).<br>
      <br>
      It is known that the dielectric constant and certain associated
      properties of a dipolar substnace are changed when it is placed in
      an electric field. But such changes hitherto produced by electric
      fields have been transitory and have vanished with the field. This
      invention is not concerned with them except insofar as they are
      necessarily associated with permanent alterations; by a permanent
      alteration is meant one that endures for an appreciable period
      after the substance has ceased to be exposed to the
      electromagnetic field. <br>
      <br>
      By an alteration in the energy content of a substance is meant one
      that does not consist solely in a change in the temperature of the
      substance or in a change enevitably consequent on change of
      temperature. On the other hand in the process known as diathermy
      the temperature of a substance which may be dipolar, is raised
      permanently (in the above sense) by exposure to a rapidly
      oscillating EM field. The object of the present invention,
      however, is not to produce a rise of temperature, although it may
      happen in certain isntances that the characteristic period or
      frequency of a dipolar substance may be such that a rise of
      temperature will inevitably occur in the course of the application
      of the process of the invention.<br>
      <br>
      The process with which this invention is concerned depends on the
      fact that a dipoalr substance is characterized by one or more
      definite periods and frequencies, which will be termed its
      characteristic periods and frequencies. The chief of these
      characteristic periods and frequencies, as explained more fully
      below, are,<br>
      <br>
      1. -- the relaxation time of the orientation of the dipoles when
      exposed to a varying electric field;<br>
      <br>
      2. -- the period of natural oscilation relative to each other of
      the charges cosntituting a dipole;<br>
      <br>
      3. differences of the terms ( in the spectroscopic sense )
      characteristic of the atomic and molecular structure.<br>
      <br>
      It has been found that permanent alteration of the energy content
      of a dipolar substance can be produced by exposing it to an EM
      field of sufficient intensity varying with a period or frequency
      substantially equal to one of these characteristic periods or
      frequencies.<br>
      <br>
      The cahracteristic periods or frequencies&nbsp; most important for
      the invention lie in the region of the spectrum corresponding ( in
      the conventional sense ) to wavelengths between 3 mm and 6 meters,
      but the use of periods of frequencies lying slightly outside these
      limits is not outside the invention. The region of the spectrum
      within which these periods or frequencies lie will be hereinafter
      termed quasi-optical. Special methods are necessary to obtain EM
      fields of sufficient intensity oscillating with these frequencies.
      They cannot be obtained by setting into osciilation combination of
      discrete condensers and self-inductances; for the dimensions of
      the condenser or coil required are so small, and consequently the
      volume in which a strong field is established is so small, that no
      sufficient amount of the substance can be instroduced into it. On
      the&nbsp; other hand two methods have been found of obtaining the
      necessary fields over the necessary volume.<br>
      <br>
      In one method conductors bounding&nbsp; the space in which the
      substance is contained are set into natural oscillations in virtue
      of their distributed capacity and inductance, so that standing
      waves are set up within the race. Suitable conductors for the
      purpose are a pair of concentric tubes or a plate-resonator, as
      descried in the copending application consisting of opposed plated
      excited into their modes of natural vibration. A field produced in
      this method will be termed hereafter a "standing field".<br>
      <br>
      In another method radiation of the appropriate frequency is
      concentrated into the space containing the substance by means of
      reflectors. A field produced by this method will be termed
      hereafter a "radiating field". <br>
      <br>
      The term "concentrated field" will mean a field produced by either
      of these methods or by any other method which can produce fields
      of the same frequency and intensity.<br>
      <br>
      According to the invention a process for altering permanently the
      energy content of dipolar substances comprises the step of
      exposing the substnace to a concentrated EM field oscillating with
      a quasi-optical period or frequency, such period or frequency
      being substantially equal to one of the characteristic periods of
      frequencies of the substance. It is to be understood that the
      oscillation of the field need not be sinusoidal, so that it has
      only a single period or frequency; it may be of any wave form so
      long as it contains at least one main component whose period or
      frequency is susbtantially equal to one of the said characteristic
      periods or frequencies.<br>
      <br>
      The nature of the invention and the means for carrying it into
      effect will now be described in greater detail.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">The Characteristic Peridods and
        Frequencies</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The first step towards a better understanding of the nature and
      scope of the invention is a discussion of the characteristic
      periods and frequencies. Those denoted above by (1), (2), and (3)
      will be discussed in order.<br>
      <br>
      (1) The orientation of dipoles expodes to a varying electric field
      is discussed at length in Chapters V and VI of Debye's book on
      "Polar Molecules" above-mentioned. The following statement is in
      principle a brief summary of his exposition.<br>
      <br>
      The orientation of dipoles along the lines of force of an
      electrostatic field is opposed by irregular motion arising from
      random thermal agitation. If the field is steady, the perfection
      of the orientation finally attained, and therefore the value of
      the dielectric constant of the material, depends only on the
      temperature, the nature of the dipoles, and the intensity of the
      field. But if the field is varying rapidly, the dipoles will not
      follow its variations accurately, their motions being hindered by
      the mutual actions which give rise to the viscosity of the
      substance. The dielectric constant depends therefore on the
      relaxation time <span style="font-style: italic;">t</span>, which
      measures roughly the time that completely orientated dipoles take
      to return to the completely unoriented state, under their thermal
      agitation, when the field is removed. The relaxation constant is
      given by<br>
      <br>
      (1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">t</span>
      = 4 pi <span style="font-style: italic;">a</span>^3 <span

    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
      where <span style="font-style: italic;">a</span> is the effective
      radius of the dipoles, <span style="font-style: italic;">n</span>
      the viscosity. <span style="font-style: italic;">T</span> the
      absolute temperature and <span style="font-style: italic;">K</span>
      Boltzmann's constant.<br>
      <br>
      The dependency of the relaxation time on the temperature <span
        style="font-style: italic;">T</span> may already be pointed out
      now as, among others, it offers the possibility of transferring
      the place of anomalous dispersion into other ranges of wavelength.<br>
      <br>
      The forces on which viscosity depends are dissipative and
      accordingly orientation under a rapidly varying field is
      accompanied by absorption of energy; the dielectric constant
      epsilon ( <span style="font-style: italic;">e</span> ) for
      a&nbsp; field of frequency <span style="font-style: italic;">v</span>
      is therefore given by the formula:<br>

      = <span style="font-style: italic;">n</span>^2 ( <span

      The shape of the curves in Figure A depend, of course, on the
      properties of the dipolar substance. In particular the scale along
      the axis of <span style="font-style: italic;">v</span> depends on
      the relaxation time <span style="font-style: italic;">t</span>.
      For, as Debye shows, both n<sup>2</sup><span style="font-style:
        italic;">k</span>, insofar as they vary with the frequency owing
      to the cause considered here, are functions of <span
        style="font-style: italic;">vt</span>. Accordingly the value of
      <span style="font-style: italic;">v</span> at which the maximum of
      <span style="font-style: italic;">k</span> occurs is inversely
      proportional or reciprocal to <span style="font-style: italic;">t</span><span
        style="font-style: italic;">t</span> is therefore a
      characeristic period, of the substance giving rise to a maximum of
      absorption for oscillations having a corresponding period.<br>
      <br>
      (2) The periods of natural oscillation of the charges of a dipole
      give rise to a second kind of anomalous dispersion which is
      completely analogous to that familiar in optics. It arises of
      course from resonance. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Figure B</span>
      shows the course of <span style="font-style: italic;">n</span><sup>2</sup>
      and <span style="font-style: italic;">k</span> which arises from
      a natural oscillation of frequency <span style="font-style:
        italic;">v</span><sub>o</sub> ( <span style="font-style:
        italic;">k</span> is here represented by <span
        style="font-style: italic;">kw</span> ). <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">Figure C</span> shows the course when
      there are several natural frequencies <span style="font-style:
        italic;">v<sub>1</sub>, v</span><sub>2</sub><span
        style="font-style: italic;">, v</span><sub>3</sub>. <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">Figure D</span> shows the course when
      a single natural frequency <span style="font-style: italic;">v</span><sub>0</sub>
      falls in the range of anomalous dispersion of the kind shown in
      Figure A between the limits <span style="font-style: italic;">v<sub>1</sub>,
        v</span><sub>2.</sub><br>
      <br>
      The natural oscillations concerned here are of two main origins.
      (a) Oscillations in electronic polarization, that is to say, the
      displacement of electrons within the atom; (b) oscillations in
      atomic polarization, that is to say, the displacement of whole
      atoms within molecules or other permanent groups of atoms. As
      well-known, the frequencies of oscillation (a) are almost all in
      the optical region; they are important for the refractive index
      for visible and ultraviolet light, but have hardly any effect in
      determining the variation of the dielectric constant at the
      quasi-optical frequencies with which this invention is concerned.
      The charcteristic frequencies of the kind in the quasi-optical
      range are those of the atomic oscillation (b). These frequencies
      also determine maxima of absorption important for the present
      invention.<br>
      <br>
      It will be observed that the region of anomalous dispersion is
      much narrower when a characteristic period of type (2) is involved
      than when a characteristic frequency of type (2) is involved. This
      may be one reason why type (2) has so far received less attention.<br>
      <br>
      (3) The third kind of characteristic frequency cannot, like the
      two considered so far, be explained in terms of classical
      conception; it demands quantum conceptions. it is well known that
      the discrete energy states in which alone any system can exist are
      each associated with a "term"; that the transition from a state of
      higher energy to one of lower energy is accompanied by the
      emission of radiation whose frequency is the difference between
      these terms; and that, conversely, the system can be raised from a
      state of lower energy to one of higher energy by radiation having
      that frequency, the radiation being absorbed in the process.
      Accordingly a difference between terms is a frequency determining
      absorption and, if it lies in the quasi-optical region, is a
      characeristic frequency for the purpose of the invention.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Detection and Adjustment of
        Characeristic Periods or Frequencies</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The process according to the invention consists in exposing a
      substance to a field of its characeristic period; and the
      efficiency of the process depends greatly on the exact adjustment
      of the period of the field to the characeristic period.<br>
      <br>
      One useful means consists in examining the substance with
      polarized light (or other known means) and so determining the
      extent of its double-refraction when exposed to the field. Outside
      the range of anomalous dispersion associated with characteristic
      periods or frequencies of types (1) and 92), the double-refraction
      depends on the intensity of the field, but is almost independent
      of its frequency; but inside that range it varies with the
      frequency. Accordingly by varying the frequency of the field and
      observing where a variation of the double refraction occurs, the
      position of a characteristic period or frequency of the types (1)
      and 92) can be determined with great accuracy. The variations of
      the dielectric constant with the frequency can, of course, be used
      for the same purpose as indicated in Figures A and B.<br>
      <br>
      When the characteristic periods or frequencies have been
      determined, the frequency of the field may be adjusted to them. In
      place of making an exact adjustment, the field may be roughly
      adjusted and then modulated with a lower frequency, so that the
      frequency of the field oscillates to and fro across the
      characteristic frequency.<br>
      <br>
      Instead of adjusting the period or frequency of the field to the
      characteristic period or frequency of the substance, the latter
      may be adjusted to the former. Thus, according to (1) the
      relaxation time depends on the temperature; this characteristic
      period can therefore be adjusted to that of the field by varying
      the temperature. Changes in characeristic periods and frequencies
      can also be produced by altering the relative concentration of two
      components of a solution, or (particularly in the case of gases)
      by altering their pressure.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Subsidiary Processes</span><br>
      <br>
      Many of the effects produced by a process according to the
      invention are probably due to the polarization of the dipoles,
      originally existing or induced, whereby they arrange themselves
      with their axis parallel to the field. Such polarization can also
      be produced by constant fields. But the constant fields required
      to produce those effects are often too large to be practicable. On
      the other hand, it has been found that there is often an advantage
      in superimposing a constant field on the field varying with the
      characteristic period or frequency. <span style="font-weight:
        bold;">The presence of the varying field greatly reduces ( e.g.
        by a factor of 10 to 20 ) the constant field required to produce
        a given effect; and the constant field, if maintained after the
        varying field has been removed, will maintain the state of
        polarization set up by the combined field.</span><br>
      <br>
      The state of polarization can be prserved in another way. If,
      after it has been set up, the viscosity of the medium is increased
      greatly, the dipoles will be unable to return to the disordered
      state by thermal agitation. Thus a liquid which has been polarized
      may be frozen, or a solvent containing the polarized substance may
      be gelatinized or removed by evaporation. This method of
      preserving a state of polarization will be termed generally
      "freezing". When a freezing operation is reversed, the state of
      polarization is destroyed and the energy characteristic of it
      liberated.<br>
      <br>
      It must be understood that the process according to the invention
      includes exposing a substance to two or more fields each varying
      with a different characteristic period or frequency; the exposure
      to these fields may be simultaneous or successive. If it is
      successive, the time of exposure to the different fields may be
      controlled by time relays.<br>
      <br>
      Again exposure to the varying field may be a continuous process,
      in whihc the substance is caused to flow, or otherwise to pass,
      through the field; in this way it may be exposed to fields of
      different strength at different points in its passage.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Application of the Process</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">A. Colloids</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      One of the most important applications of the process according to
      the invention is to the dispersion and coagulation of colloidal
      solutions. The effect of the polarization due to the field in
      promoting these changes is in most case connected with hydration
      of the dispersed particles and/or with changes of the hydrogen-ion
      concentration. The first effect of exposure to te field is usually
      an increase in dispersion; but a prolonged exposure may reverse
      this effect and produce coagulation.<br>
      <br>
      Thus a certain <span style="font-weight: bold;">colloidal
        solution of gold</span> was found by the method described to
      have a characeristic period corresponding to a wavelength of <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">18.5 cm</span>. A layer of 1 mm thick
      was exposed at a temperature of 20* C to a standing field fed by
      valves giving an output of 0.1 watt. After one hour the original
      red colour had changed to orange, indicating an increased
      dispersion; after 2 hours the effect had been reversed and further
      exposure produced coagulation.<br>
      <br>
      Again an agar-agar gel with a characteristic period corresponding
      to a wavelength of 116 cm was exposed to a field supplied by a
      generator yielding 10 watts. After 10 minutes the mobility of the
      gel had increased; but after several hours the effect was reversed
      and the gel had become more viscous.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">B. Preservation of Organic
        Materials</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The first stage in the ageing of an organic material is usually a
      coagulation of a colloid. Accordingly by the process according to
      the invention ageing may be prevented or even reversed, so that
      the product is reversed. For the reason just explained, it is
      necessary to adjust the time of exposure suitably; it has been
      found that a discontinuous process, in which the substance is
      alternately exposed and not exposed, is generally more effective
      than continuous exposure to a field of lesser intensity.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, 2 liters of cow's <span style="font-weight: bold;">milk</span>,
      3 hours old, was exposed for 2 minutes to fields of each of five
      frequencies. The wave lengths lambda and the power N of these
      fields were: -- <span style="font-weight: bold;">lambda1 = 455
        cm, N1 = 230 watts ; lambda2 = 283, N2 = 160 ; lambda3 = 355, N3
        = 160 ; lambda4 = 163, N4 = 23 ; V5 = 27.5 ; N = 0.6. The
        temperature was originally 20* C and rose to 23 * C. The milk so
        treated kept fresh for 28 days and could be preserved still
        longer by exposing it for 5 minutes in each hour to a field of
        the above wavelength with a total energy of 3.2 watts.</span><br>
      <br>
      Again <span style="font-weight: bold;">2.5 kg of veal, 36 hours
        old, was treated for 3 minutes with a field given ( as above by:
        -- lambda1 = 468 cm, N1 = 250 watts, lambda2 = 362, N2 = 150,
        lambda3 = 184, N3 = 10, lambda4 = 92.5, N4 = 3. The temperature
        rose from 20* C to 24.5* C. The meat remained fresh for 2 weeks
        and could be kept still longer by exposing it for 5 minutes in
        each hour to these wavelengths with a total power of 3 watts.</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Again, 2 liters of apple juice
        was exposed for 1-1/2 minutes to a fiield given by: -- lambda1 =
        475 cm, N1 = 200 watts, lambda2 = 354, N2 = 150; lambda3 = 145,
        N3 = 15; lambda = 45, N4 = 1.2. The temperature rose from 22* C
        to 24.5* C. The juice showed no sign of fermentation ater beign
        kept 4 months in a covered jar.</span><br style="font-weight:
        bold;">
      <br>
    </div>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">C.
        Action on Living Organisms</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The process according to the invention can also be applied to
      organic materials while they still form part of the living
      organism. Thus <span style="font-weight: bold;">animal sera</span>
      possess characteristic periods and frequencies, which vary with
      the nature and source of the sera. One of these corresponds
      approximately to a <span style="font-weight: bold;">wavelength of
        90 cm</span>; between this frequency and the highest (which is
      characteristic of <span style="font-weight: bold;">water</span>
      and <span style="font-weight: bold;">corresponds to 1.28 cm</span>
      ) are a large number of characteristic frequencies which vary even
      in the same serum with the state of the animals. The determination
      of these characteristic freqencies may therefore have a high value
      in diagnosis or other examination of the state of the animal. In
      determining them too great an exposure to the field must be
      avoided, for grave injury may thereby be inflicted.<br>
      <br>
      But if the exposure is suitably regulated, beneficial effects may
      result from the field, especially in the direction of increased
      vitality, such as stimulation of cell-division. Thus growth may be
      promoted. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Bean seeds, previously
        swollen, were exposed for 30 seconds at a temperature of 35* C
        to fields with frequencies corresponding to 28 cm and 87 cm, the
        total output of the generator being 1.5 watts. After four weeks
        such seeds have grown twice as much as similar untreated seeds.</span><br>
      <br>
      Fermentation and other process due to bacteria can also be
      promoted. The frequencies of the field used may be those
      characeristic either of the bacteria themselves or of substances
      in the medium containing the bacteria which effect their activity.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">The growth of crystals</span>, as
      well as of organisms, <span style="font-weight: bold;">can be
        stimulated</span> by the process according to the invention, <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">if the mother liquor is exposed to a
        varying field of suitable frequency during crystalization</span>.
      Of course it is not implied that the cause which promotes
      inorganic growth is preceisely the same as that which promotes the
      organic growth.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">D. Storage of Energy</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Electrets, that is to say, permanently polarized dielectrics ( the
      electrical analogues of permanent magnets ) can be made by
      subjecting a melted dielectric to the process according to the
      invention and then allowing it to solidify. Electrets produced by
      other process are, of course, already known. Thus a mixture of 100
      gr glycerine, 50 gr beeswax, 550 gr montan wax and 400 gr pine
      resin was melted at 110* C and a layer 8 mm thick exposed for 10
      minutes to a varying field fed by a generator giving 22.5 watts at
      a frequency correpsonding to a wavelength of from 145 to 185 cm on
      which was superimposed a constant field arising from a potential
      difference of 12,000 volts between plates 10-20 mm distant. The
      temperature was lowered to 20* C within 3 minutes. Permanent
      surface charges of the resulting plate up to 2 x 10^-9
      coulomb/cm^2 were obtained.<br>
      <br>
      Substances thus endowed with energy from polarization can be used
      to supply animals with energy in an effective form. For when the
      substances are melted or otherwise "unfrozen" in or on the body of
      the animal, the energy stored is liberated. Medicaments already
      known may thus be rendered more effective.<br>
      <br>
      Thus a medical plaster was made by adding 6 gr of euphorbium
      powder to a melt containing 64 gr of turpentine, and spreading the
      mixture on a silk cloth. While the mixture was melted at 85* C it
      was exposed for 5 minutes to a field of frequency corresponding to
      a wavelength of 235 cm on which was superimposed a constant field
      arising from a potential difference of 8500 volts. it was then
      cooled within 2 minutes to 15* C. The resulting surface charge was
      0.7 x 10^-9 coulomb/cm^2.<br>
      <br>
      Medicaments for internal use can be prepared in the same way. Thus
      disinfecting pastileles consisting of beeswax and gums together
      with the usual drugs were exposed for 10 minnutes in layers 5 mm
      thick at a temperature of 55* C to a field given (as above) by
      lambda1 = 312 cm, N1 = 150 watts; lambda2 = 145, N2 = 25 watts, on
      which was superimposed a constant field arising from a potential
      difference of 12,000 volts. After cooling to 15* C within two
      minutes the resulting surface charge was about 10^-9 coulomb/cm^2.<br>
      <br>
      Again photographic plates, endowed with permanent polarization by
      subjecting them to a process according to the invention during
      preparation, may have an increased sensitivity, especially in the
      red and infrared.<br>
      <br>
      Dielectrics with permanent polarization charge have a greater
      dielectric strength in consequence of their anisotropic inner
      structure if stressed in the direction of the dipole axes
      subjected to orientation.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">E. Chemical Reactions</span><br>
      <br>
      The changes consdiered so far might be classed as physical rather
      than chemcial; but if sufficiently strong fields are employed, the
      process according to the invention can induce definite chemical
      reactions.<br>
      <br>
      Thus the process can produce changes in the mutual relations of
      the atoms in a molecule of the kind known as tautomeric. It can
      promote reactions which are of the nature of polymerization. Thus
      the process will accelerate the drying of lacquers and varnishes,
      the consolidation of styrol, the change of Bakelite A and B into
      C, and of isoprene into rubber. Rubber can be vulcanized with no
      more than a trace of sulfur. In the manufacture of artificial silk
      the increase of viscosity that occurs as the material leaves the
      spinning nozzle can be stabilized so as to make the finished
      product highly resistant to wear.<br>
      <br>
      The process can produce other reactions that usually require a
      catalyst; for instance acetylene and steam in the presence of
      ozone react to form acetic acid, with acetaldehyde as an
      intermediate product. For such reactions the most effective
      frequencies usually lie in the range corresponding to wavelengths
      of 2.5 - 3.5, 8.6 - 9.5, 26.5 - 30.5 cm. These characteristic
      frequencies are probably of type (3), being term differences.<br>
      <br>
      If, while a reaction of the kind last mentioned is proceeding
      under the influence of a varying field having a characteristic
      frequency, a strong constant field is superimposed on the varying
      field, the energy set free in the reaction may appear in the form
      of radiation having a characeristic frequency of type (3). A
      chemical reaction can thereby be used to generate quasi-optical
      radiation, which can be detected and used in any suitbale manner.
      Reactions between substnaces having great natural affinity, e.g.,
      hydrogen, chlorine, phosphorus, arsenic, are favorable to this
      phenomenon. The radiation emitted may be that associated with the
      term differences of <span style="font-weight: bold;">hydrogen,
        which correpsond to wavelengths of 2.74, 9.25 and 27.75</span>.
      If there are two or more adjacent term-differences characteristic
      of the substances, a band spectrum may be emitted. Also, in
      accordance with known principles, radiation of lower frequency
      that that corresponding to the term difference may appear.<br>
      <br>
      In the examples given above the particular figures stated in
      respect of the various quantities such as wavelength are believed
      to be optimum values for the individual cases. Clearly the
      beneficial results obtained must at least to a certain extent vary
      with the initial conditions of the substances, particularly
      biological substances, which are treated.<br>
      <br>
      Having now particularly described and ascertained the nature of my
      said invention and in what manner the same is to be performed, I
      declare that what I claim is: -- [ Claims not included here ]<br>

        Abstract</span> -- Electromagnetic fields of quasi-optical
      frequencies are generated in the space between two
      oppositely-placed electrodes which are excited at one or more of
      their natural frequencies by an external high-frequency source.
      The electrodes are the seat of electromagnetic waves, after the
      manner of Lecher wires, but in two dimensions instead of one. The
      apparatus is applied for various purposes, including the chemical,
      physical, and biological processes referred to in Specification
      417,501. The distribution of electric stress in the dielectric may
      be made visible by a polarized-light projection system. Fig. 1
      shows a resonator comprising parallel circular plates 1, 2 excited
      by high-frequency voltages applied by the conductors 3, 4. The
      plates may be of square or rectangular form, and may be inclined
      to each other. One or both may be concave or convex on its inner
      surface. Current and voltage waves are propagated along the plates
      in the same manner as along Lecher wires. With circular plates
      excited at their centres and with their rims free, the fundamental
      oscillation gives a voltage peak and a current node at the rim. If
      the rims are short-circuited by added capacity, as for instance by
      inserting the resonator in a metal cylinder 9, Fig. 24, the
      voltage peak and current node are at the centre. The plates also
      resonate at higher frequencies, with nodal diameters and nodal
      concentric circles. With rectangular plates, nodal lines parallel
      or oblique to the edges are created. The positions of the nodal
      lines may be predetermined by metal blocks 10, Fig. 24, fixed to
      the external cylinder 9, or to one of the plates 1, 2. The plates
      may be of good conducting metal, or of poorly-conductive metal
      with or without a coating of good conductivity;&nbsp; or the
      plates may be in the form of containers filled with an
      electrolyte. The plates may be light-permeable, consisting of
      glass with a very thin coating of precious metal on their inner or
      outer faces. One or both plates may also be in the form of wire
      grids stretched across rings of insulating material and
      electro-plated with copper or silver to provide good conductivity
      where the wires cross. The resonator plates are excited by
      separate generators of damped or undamped waves. Fig. 25 shows a
      valve generator 54 with Lecher-wire output circuit 45, 46 tuned by
      a condenser bridge 53, and with the resonator 51, 52 loosely
      coupled thereto by two air gaps between small spheres 47--50. The
      coupling condensers may take the form of a ball and ring, or of
      small parallel plates at adjustable distance. The couplings may be
      slidable along the wires 45, 46, and along the resonator plates.
      The Lecher wires may be in the form of a wire and concentric tube,
      and they may be provided with knot extremities for coupling to the
      edge of the resonator plates. By inserting the Lecher wires
      between the resonator plates, an inductive coupling may be
      provided. In Fig. 32, the concentric-tube Lecher system 99 is
      adjusted in length by a trombone slide 108 and is tuned by
      reflection bridges 102, 103 placed in the divided branches 100,
      100. The coupling conductors 104, 105 of the resonator 106, 107
      project into the interior of the conduits. When liquid to be
      treated is contained in a glass envelope 128, Fig. 40, placed
      between the plates 120, 121 of the resonator, the dielectric is
      composed of layers of air glass and liquid. The Specification
      discusses the effect of the composite dielectric on the natural
      frequencies and the damping of the resonator. The distribution of
      electric stress in the liquid may be rendered visible by the
      apparatus of Fig. 40. The resonator plates are coupled by rods
      122, 123 to Lecher wires 124, 125 fed by a valve generator 126.
      Temperature may be regulated by heating-coils 129 within the
      casing 130. Light from a source 137 which may be a mercury vapour
      lamp is projected through lens 131 , polarizing-prism 133, mica
      plates 135 and lens 132 , and after passage through the treated
      liquid 128 emerges through similar devices to the screen 138,
      giving thereon a picture of the field distribution within the
      resonator. If the exciting oscillation is modulated, a complex
      varying pattern is produced. Glass or liquid lenses 142, 143, Fig.
      41, may be arranged between the container 144 for the liquid under
      treatment and the resonator plates 140, 141. If convex as shown
      the lenses tend to equalize the field over the whole area whilst
      concave lenses concentrate the field in the centre. The lenses may
      be attached to the container 144 or the plates 140, 141. The
      resonator may be housed in a double-walled cylindrical casing with
      external knobs and dials for screw adjustment of the plate gap.
      Heating coils and coils for spraying cooling liquids into the
      casing are provided. Lecher wires of the concentric type are led
      through the container walls to excite the resonator, and high
      tension may be applied through chokes. The resonator plates may
      take the form of shelves 231--233, Fig. 49, separated by
      insulating posts 234, the material to be treated, for example
      foodstuffs, being placed upon the shelves. Energy may be led to
      the shelves by Lecher wire systems terminating in knobs adjacent
      to the edges of the shelves.<br>
