      This invention was conceived under Contract No. W-31-109-ENG-38
      between the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and the University of
      Chicago representing Argonne National Laboratories. The United

      <b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      This invention pertains generally to lubricant and fuel
      composition containing boron ions and molecules for improved
      lubricity and methods relating to the same.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      Sulfur is found naturally in crude oil and carries through into
      diesel and gasoline fuels unless specifically removed through
      distillation. As a result, diesel and gasoline fuels used in
      engines may contain sulfur in concentrations up to 3000 parts per
      million (ppm). At such high concentrations, sulfur provides high
      lubricity in fuel pumps and injector systems that deliver the fuel
      to the combustion chamber in an engine. However, fuel sulfur also
      causes polluting emissions, particularly SO2 and soot particles,
      and poisons the advanced emission-control and after treatment
      devices that are being developed to enable diesel engines to meet
      progressively more stringent emissions standards. Sulfur dioxide
      emissions are associated with environmental problems such as acid
      rain. However, when the current sulfur level is reduced in fuels,
      high friction and wear occur on sliding surfaces of fuel delivery
      systems and cause catastrophic failure.<br>
      <br>
      Fuels with lower sulfur content have lower lubricity compared to
      those with higher sulfur content. Thus, low-sulfur diesel fuels do
      not provide sufficient lubricity for use in diesel engines, and
      the use of low-sulfur diesel fuels results in high friction and
      catastrophic wear of fuel pumps and injectors. When lubricity is
      compromised, wear increases in fuel injection systems, most of
      which were originally designed with the natural lubricating
      properties of traditional diesel fuel in mind. The lower lubricity
      of low-sulfur fuels poses significant problems for producers as
      well as for end-users of diesel fuels. Reduction in lubricity also
      contributes to a loss in useable power due to the increased
      friction the engine has to overcome. Because fuels with lower
      sulfur contents exhibit increased friction characteristics
      compared to fuels with higher sulfur contents, a perfectly tuned
      engine experiences a noticeable drop in efficiency when the fuel
      is changed from a high-sulfur fuel to a low-sulfur fuel. The
      typical diesel fuel currently used by trucks is a high-sulfur
      diesel fuel having a sulfur content of about 500 ppm. Low-sulfur
      diesel fuels have a sulfur content of approximately 140 ppm. Ultra
      low-sulfur diesel fuels have a sulfur content of 3 ppm. Fischer
      Tropsch fuels, the cleanest of all fuels, have a sulfur content of
      approximately zero. Because of its zero sulfur content, Fischer
      Tropsch fuel is an attractive diesel fuel, creating the least
      amount of pollution. Unfortunately, because it contains zero
      sulfur, it has no lubricity at all. Thus, Fischer Tropsch fuel
      causes the highest wear damage on sliding test samples. If it were
      used in today's engines, it would cause the instant failure of
      fuel pumps and injectors. Thus, it is not sufficient to simply
      reduce the sulfur content of fuels, because doing so would rob
      diesel fuels of their value as effective lubricants.<br>
      <br>
      New mandates by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) call for
      the reduction of sulfur in diesel fuels to levels as low as 40 ppm
      in 2004 and to 15 ppm beginning Jun. 1, 2006. Such a move would
      quickly lead to the catastrophic failure of diesel fuel system
      components. The same requirements are also in place in Europe and
      Japan. The United States has been closely monitoring the use of
      low-sulfur fuels around the world. In Sweden and Canada,
      low-sulfur diesel fuels have been used for several years. Problems
      with increased wear have been encountered in both countries. The
      wholesale introduction of low-sulfur fuel in Sweden has had a
      disastrous effect on diesel engine operation. Swedish refiners are
      now using additives to prevent excessive wear in fuel injection
      systems, and their problems are apparently under control. Certain
      major Canadian refining companies are also adding lubricants
      before delivering low-sulfur fuels to customers.<br>
      <br>
      The American Society of Tool and Manufacturing Engineers (ASTME),
      the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE), and the International
      Organization for Standardization (ISO), have not yet set fuel
      lubricity specifications for supplying or testing low-sulfur
      fuels. Because of added costs, refiners are unlikely to consider
      supplying a pre-additized fuel before a specification has been
      set. Until the lubricity specification is written and followed,
      responsibility rests with diesel equipment end users to use fuel
      additives to maintain the reliability of their diesel engines.<br>
      <br>
      A common approach to the problem of low-sulfur fuels has been to
      add lubricant compositions to fuels that reduce friction in
      internal combustion engines. Various patents disclose additives
      formulated as lubricating oils and blended into fuels. Alcohols
      are well known for their lubricity properties when included in
      lubricating oil formulations. Alcohols are also known for their
      water-scavenging characteristics when blended into fuels. The use
      of vicinal hydroxyl-containing alkyl carboxylates, such as the
      ester glycerol monooleate, have also found widespread use as
      lubricity additives or as components in lubricating oil
      compositions.<br>
      <br>
      Borated lubrication compounds are well known lubrication additives
      for fuel compositions. Borated lubrication compounds are known to
      have high viscosity indices and favorable low temperature
      characteristics. Such boron-containing compounds are known to be
      non-corrosive to copper, to possess antioxidant and potential
      antifatigue characteristics, and to exhibit antiwear and high
      temperature dropping point properties for greases. Borated esters
      and hydrocarbyl vicinal diols have long been proposed as fuel or
      lubricant additives, especially as mixtures of long chain alcohols
      or hydroxyl-containing aliphatic, preferably alkyl, carboxylates.
      Borated lubrication compounds are generally obtained by synthetic
      methods known in the art. Typically, these borated lubrication
      compounds are prepared by reacting boric acid or boric oxide with
      appropriate aliphatic or alkoxylated compounds.<br>
      <br>
      Borated derivatives of phosphorus are also known additives for
      liquid fuel or lubricant compositions. Such borated phosphorus
      derivatives include borated dihydrocarbyl hydrocarbylphosphonates.
      Borated phosphite additives may be synthesized by reacting
      dihydrocarbyl phosphites with such boron-containing compounds as
      boric oxide, metaborates, alkylborates or boric acid in the
      presence of a hydrocarbyl vicinal diol.<br>
      <br>
      Organometallic boron-containing compounds are yet another class of
      fuel additives. In low-sulfur fuels, such organometallic compounds
      effect a lowering of the ignition temperature of exhaust particles
      in diesel engines equipped with an exhaust system particulate
      trap. Organometallic compounds contain a metal capable of forming
      a complex with an organic compound. Useful metals for use in such
      compounds include Na, K, Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba, Ti, Zr, V, Cr, Ni, Mn,
      Fe, Co, Cu, Zn, B, Pb, and Sb. Borated versions of such
      organometallic complexes are derived or synthesized from both
      aliphatic and heterocyclic organic compounds.<br>
      <br>
      Although various patents describe boron-containing additives that
      provide lubricity to fuel compositions, all the conventional
      additives are based on compositions that require prior synthesis
      before addition to the fuel. Some, such as phosphates and amines,
      require complex formulations and lengthy preparation, and
      therefore are not cost effective as fuel ingredients. These
      synthetics have not readily been taken up to replace sulfur in
      fuel compositions.<br>
      <br>
      In terms of cost and effectiveness, the synthetics are impractical
      for several reasons. First, large amounts of additives are needed
      in order to achieve the same level of lubricity that a sulfur
      concentration of 500 ppm can provide in fuels. In addition, some
      of the current additives are “one shot” or “point-of-use”
      additives. These have to be added to the fuel tank at refills
      because they cannot easily be incorporated into the distillation
      processes in refiners. Other additives may fail when fuel
      injectors begin to operate at high pressures, such as 30,000 psi,
      because higher pressures mean smaller clearances between an
      injector's plunger and barrel, which results in more opportunity
      for engine wear. These higher pressures will soon be required by
      the EPA as part of the more advanced emission control
      technologies. Finally, the current additives may harm metallic or
      plastic fuel system components by causing corrosion and producing
      deposits in the long run.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, a need remains for a readily available ingredient that can
      be easily and simply combined with low-sulfur fuel compositions to
      provide an additive that is inexpensive, non-toxic, and confers
      enhanced lubricity to low-sulfur fuels.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      The present invention relates to methods for providing lubricity
      in fuels and lubricants, to fuel and lubricant compositions that
      include boron, and to a method of powering engines to minimize
      wear.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention provides for boron additives that, when
      mixed with either low-sulfur or sulfur free diesel and gasoline
      fuels, solve the friction, galling, and severe wear problems
      encountered with sulfur free fuels. The increase in lubricity that
      occurs upon addition of the boron compounds or boric acid of the
      invention to low-sulfur fuels results in lower wear in fuel pumps
      and injector systems. The replacement of sulfur in fuels with
      boron compounds provides for a cleaner environment, at a low cost
      relative to other additive technologies currently in use. The
      inventive approach should stimulate increased use of sulfur-free
      diesel and gasoline fuels. Easy adaptation by industry is
      possible, since the additives are easily and cheaply obtained and
      can be mixed directly with fuels without the necessity for any
      intervening chemical synthesis, or the use of other ingredients of
      questionable toxicity. Alcohol containing gasoline fuels can also
      be formulated with these inventive boron additives.<br>
      <br>
      Demonstration of the application and use of these additives in
      diesel fuels should generate immediate and widespread industrial
      interest. Primary beneficiaries should be the companies that
      manufacture diesel engines and those that produce diesel fuels.
      The production and use of small size diesel engines in passenger
      cars providing very good fuel economy and very low emissions will
      also be feasible. Use of the boron compounds and additives should
      lead to a cleaner environment and longer engine life. Thus, people
      who drive and live or work in areas where diesel powered
      transportation systems are used will also benefit from this
      technology.<br>
      <br>
      The invention provides a method for providing lubricity in a fuel
      or lubricant such as an oil product. The method includes adding a
      boron compound (primarily based on boron, oxygen and hydrogen) or
      boric acid to a fuel and/or oil to provide a boron-containing fuel
      or lubricant. The additives of the present invention can be any
      simple boron compound that dissolves in a common solvent to form a
      solution, preferably fully miscible with a diesel or gasoline fuel
      or a lubricant, to produce a concentration of boric acid molecules
      and/or BO3 ions or monomers in the fuel or lubricant composition.
      Suitable boron compounds for use in providing increased lubricity
      in a fuel or lubricant include, but are not limited to, boric
      acid, borax, boron oxide, nanometer-sized boric acid powders,
      trimethylborate, trimethoxyboroxin or combinations of these. The
      fuels to be used with the invention may contain a boron compound
      at a level of from about 30 ppm to about 3,000 ppm, and a
      concentration of sulfur of less than about 500 ppm. Lubricants to
      be used with the invention may contain a boron compound such as a
      borate, boroxin or combination thereof at a concentration of about
      100 to about 80,000 ppm.<br>
      <br>
      Suitable fuels for use with the present methods for providing
      lubricity in a fuel include, but are not limited to, diesel, gas,
      kerosene, dimethyl ether, liquid propane gas, liquid propane
      fuels, liquefied natural gas, or combinations of these.<br>
      <br>
      Suitable lubricants for use with the present methods for providing
      lubricity in a lubricant include, but are not limited to, oil
      products such as base or formulated vegetable oils, mineral oils,
      synthetic oils, greases and combinations thereof. Glycols such as
      polyethylene glycol and combinations thereof can also be used as a
      lubricant with inventive methods.<br>
      <br>
      In certain embodiments of the invention the boron compound or
      boric acid is added to a solvent prior to adding the boron
      compound to the fuel. In such embodiments the solvent may be an
      alcohol, such as methanol or ethanol. In one embodiment of the
      invention, a concentrated methanolic solution of boric acid is
      mixed with a low-sulfur or sulfur free diesel fuel, providing a
      boric acid concentration of from about 200 to about 2000 ppm in
      the fuel.<br>
      <br>
      A method of powering an engine to minimize wear is also provided.
      The method includes burning a fuel which may have a sulfur content
      of less than about 150 ppm, wherein the fuel contains a boron
      compound or boric acid at a concentration of from about 30 ppm to
      about 3,000 ppm. An average wear scar diameter of less than about
      0.40 mm occurs under standard conditions when such a method is
      used.<br>

      </b><b> DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      Generally, the present invention provides a method for providing
      enhanced lubricity in a fuel. The same concept can be used to
      achieve lubricity in oil products, such as, mineral, vegetable,
      and synthetic base and formulated oils and greases, as well as
      other lubricants such as polyethylene glycols. The inventive
      approach exploits a family of simple, inexpensive, and
      environmentally-benign boron compounds which, when added to a fuel
      or lubricant, improve the lubricating properties of those fuels
      and lubricants. The addition of the boron compounds to a fuel
      improves the lubricity of the fuel by compensating for the lower
      lubricity that occurs when fuels with lower levels of sulfur are
      used.<br>
      <br>
      The additives of the present invention can be any simple boron
      compound that dissolves in a common solvent to form a solution,
      which may be fully miscible with a diesel or gasoline fuel or a
      lubricant, to produce a concentration of boric acid molecules
      and/or BO3 ions or monomers in the fuel or lubricant composition.
      Without intending to be bound to any particular theory, it is
      believed that solutionized boric acid molecules and negatively
      charged BO3 monomers in the fuel or lubricant solutions bind
      strongly to the metallic surfaces of fuel pump and injector
      systems and protect these surfaces against wear and high-friction
      losses. Once bonded to these surfaces, the boric acid molecules
      and BO3 ions are thought to rearrange themselves in a plate-like
      boric acid structure, providing an unusual capacity to enhance the
      anti-friction and anti-wear properties of sliding metallic
      surfaces. Tests show that boric acid films formed by dipping
      steel, aluminum, titanium, and magnesium surfaces in water or
      methanolic solutions of boric acid are strongly bonded to these
      surfaces, making them very slippery and resistant to wear. Such
      films provide excellent lubrication to these metals when subjected
      to metal forming operations (such as stamping, rolling,
      deep-drawing, and forging).<br>
      <br>
      Since the most effective components for improving lubricity are
      boric acid molecules and BO3 monomers or ions, any simple boron
      compound that generates boric acid molecules or BO3 may be used to
      increase lubricity in low-sulfur fuels. Boron compounds that are
      known to release boric acid and/or BO3 in water or alcohol
      solutions are: borax, kernite, ulexite, and colemanite. Other
      suitable boron compounds include boric acid, borax, boric oxide
      and other anhydrous or hydrated forms of boron. These compounds
      easily and readily form concentrated solutions in solvents such as
      methanol or ethanol. In addition, borates, boroxins, and
      combinations thereof can be mixed with solvents and fuels. For
      example, trimethylborate and trimethoxyboroxin are also ideal
      additives since they exist in liquid forms and are completely
      miscible with fuels.<br>
      <br>
      Suitable fuels for use with the present methods for providing
      lubricity in a fuel include, but are not limited to diesel, gas,
      kerosene, dimethyl ether, liquid propane gas, liquid propane
      fuels, liquefied natural gas, or combinations of these. The fuels
      may also include a lubricant other than the boron compound such as
      those described herein.<br>
      <br>
      Suitable lubricants for use with the present compositions and
      methods for providing lubricity in a lubricant include, but are
      not limited to, oil products such as base and formulated vegetable
      oils, mineral oils, synthetic oils, greases, and combinations
      thereof; polyethylene glycols and combinations thereof.<br>
      <br>
      One embodiment of the method includes adding the boron compound or
      boric acid to a fuel to provide a boron-containing fuel that
      comprises boron compounds or boric acid at a level of from about
      30 ppm to about 3,000 ppm. In various embodiments, the method
      provides a boron-containing fuel having a boron compound at a
      level of from about 200 to about 2000 ppm in the fuel,
      alternatively from about 50 ppm to about 1,000 ppm, or from about
      100 ppm to about 500 ppm.<br>
      <br>
      In some embodiments of the invention, a boron compound is added to
      a lubricant to provide a lubricant comprising a boron compound at
      a concentration of from about 100 ppm to about 80,00 ppm. In other
      embodiments, the amount of boron compound may vary from about 100
      ppm to about 60,000 ppm, from about 100 ppm to about 50,000 ppm,
      and from about 500 or 1000 ppm to about 50,000 ppm.<br>
      <br>
      Generally, the boron compounds or boric acid can be added to any
      fuel regardless of the sulfur content. In certain embodiments, the
      fuel has a sulfur concentration of less than about 500 ppm,
      possibly less than about 150 ppm, or even less than about 5 ppm,
      less than about 3 ppm, or even about 0 ppm. A fuel composition
      according to the invention, for example, includes a fuel having a
      sulfur content of less than about 500 ppm mixed with boric acid.
      The boric acid is typically present at a concentration of from
      about 100 ppm to about 3,000 ppm.<br>
      <br>
      The invention also provides a method of powering an engine to
      minimize wear. The method includes burning a fuel which may have a
      sulfur content of less than about 500 ppm or less than about 150
      ppm. The fuel includes a boron compound or boric acid at a
      concentration of from about 30 ppm and 3,000 ppm to the fuel. The
      boron compounds may be in the form of ionic compounds.<br>
      <br>
      The lubricity of a given fuel can be determined through wear scar
      diameter measurements taken on a ball-on-three-disks (BOTD)
      instrument, as described in greater detail in the Examples section
      below. FIGS. 1 and 4-7 show the effects of the boron additives of
      this invention on the lubricity performance of diesel fuels, as
      measured by wear scar diameters. As shown in these figures, the
      average wear scar diameter for fuels treated with the boron
      compounds of this invention is approximately 3 to 4 mm when the
      fuel is tested according to the standard procedures described
      below. This is similar to the wear scar diameter produced with
      high-sulfur (500 ppm) diesel fuel and is considerably smaller than
      the wear scar diameters produced by untreated low-sulfur (150
      ppm), ultra low-sulfur (3 ppm), and no sulfur (0 ppm) diesel
      fuels.<br>
      <br>
      The lubricity of a given lubricant, such as an oil or grease, can
      be determined through friction coefficient measurements taken on a
      pin-on-disk instrument, as described in greater detail in the
      Examples section below. FIGS. 8-10 and table 5 show the effects of
      the boron additives of this invention on the lubricity performance
      of various oil products, as measured by friction coefficients. As
      shown in the figures and table, the friction coefficients for
      lubricants treated with boron additives are lower than those for
      untreated lubricants. This is consistent with improved lubricity
      performance for the treated lubricants.<br>
      <br>
      In certain embodiments, the inventive additives are prepared in
      the form of concentrated solutions of simple, readily available
      boron compounds such as boric acid, borax, boron oxide, boron
      anhydrides, hydrates and other such materials. Such solutions are
      easily mixed with sulfur-free or low-sulfur diesel and gasoline
      fuels. Among others, ethanol and methanol are particularly
      effective solvents, and are among the most suitable candidates for
      introducing boron into gasoline fuels. Other suitable solvents
      include, but are not limited to, isobutyl alcohol, isoamyl
      alcohol, n-propanol alcohol, 2-methylbutanol alcohol, glycerol,
      glycol, ethylene glycol, glycerin, pyridine, lactate esters (such
      as ethyl lactate) or combinations of these solvents.<br>
      <br>
      In one embodiment, the inventive method exploits the fact that
      boric acid dissolves in an ethanol or methanol solution in great
      quantities such that the solvents can be used as a carrier of
      boron as a lubricity additive. Boric acid is most soluble in
      methanol, approximately 175 grams of boric acid dissolve readily
      in one liter of solvent. Lower solubilities are found in ethanol,
      pyridine, isobutyl alcohol, acetone, and water. The solubility of
      boric acid in these solvents is shown in FIG. 3. Boric acid is an
      attractive additive because it is a very mild, non-toxic acid that
      is environmentally benign—water solutions of boric acid are often
      used to wash eyes. Concentrated water solutions of boric acid have
      a pH value of 4.5 at room temperature. Boric acid is not expected
      to cause any corrosion in the fuel delivery systems. Indeed, in
      certain corrosion experiments, boric acid has been used as a
      buffer solution to control and adjust pH.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 1 shows the effect of a highly concentrated (18%) methanolic
      solution of boric acid when mixed with low-sulfur diesel fuel (140
      ppm). FIG. 4 shows the effect of a highly concentrated methanolic
      solution of boric acid when mixed with ultra low-sulfur diesel
      fuel (3 ppm). As shown in the figures, low and ultra low-sulfur
      diesel fuels containing between 100 and 2000 ppm boric acid have a
      lubricity performance comparable to high-sulfur diesel fuel, which
      is substantially better than the lubricity performance of
      untreated, low and ultra low-sulfur diesel fuels. Methanol and
      ethanol-based solvents are produced from cornstalks in the Midwest
      by Archer Daniels Midland. These solvents are already used with
      current gasoline in diesel fuels up to a level of 10%, but the
      United States government is urging their use in much greater
      quantities since methanol and ethanol are renewable non-polluting
      fuels. If necessary, the solubility of the boron compounds in
      these alcohols can be increased by heating them, but the
      concentrations achieved at room temperature are more than
      sufficient to restore the lubricity of low-sulfur diesel fuels.<br>
      <br>
      Another effective way to achieve lubricity in low-sulfur diesel
      fuels and in lubricants is to add to the fuel or lubricant a
      borate, boroxin or combination thereof. Suitable borates include
      trialkylborates such as trimethylborate, and suitable boroxins
      include trimethylboroxin, trimethoxyboroxin, and tributoxyboroxin.
      These commercial products come in liquid forms. They are clear and
      transparent and mix and blend quite well with gasoline or diesel
      fuels. They burn clean and have some calorific value. They are
      perfectly soluble in diesel and gasoline fuels and, once added to
      diesel fuel, dramatically improve the lubricity of low-sulfur
      diesel fuels. Thus, trimethylborate and trimethoxyboroxin may be
      added directly to the fuel. For example, as shown in FIG. 5,
      trimethylborate provides the best improvement of the lubricity
      behavior of low-sulfur diesel fuels of all the boron additives
      tested. Notably, FIG. 5 shows that low-sulfur fuels to which
      trimethylborate has been added exhibit an average wear scar
      diameter even lower than that of the highest sulfur content diesel
      fuel. As shown in FIGS. 6(a) and (b), addition of
      trimethoxyboroxin into no sulfur (0 ppm) and low-sulfur (140 ppm)
      diesel fuels also makes a huge positive difference in fuel's
      lubricity. Other trialkylborates may also be used to improve
      lubricity in fuels. Examples of such trialkylborates include, but
      are not limited to, triethylborate, tri(n-propyl)borate,
      tri(n-butyl)borate, and mixed alkyl borates such as
      diethylmethylborate.<br>
      <br>
      In other embodiments of the invention, nanometer size powders of
      solid boron compounds, such as boric acid, may be solutionized or
      dispersed in fuels and oil products to achieve improved lubricity.
      Nanometer-sized particles of boron compounds may also be mixed and
      fully dispersed in or miscible with fuels and oil products to
      achieve lubricity.<br>
      <br>
      Nanometer-sized powders of boric acid (3-100 nm) can be produced
      by methods well known in the art. These methods include mechanical
      attrition, chemical precipitation, low pressure gas condensation
      and low temperature evaporation of ethyl borates or methanol or
      ethanol solutions of boric acid into or through the fuels or oils,
      etc. Because of a very high surface atom to bulk atom ratio, these
      nanometer-sized boron or boric acid particles can directly be
      incorporated into fuel and oil products such as base and
      formulated vegetable, mineral, and synthetic oils, greases and
      combinations thereof. Most of the atoms in these nanometer-sized
      particles reside on the surface of the particles and they are
      chemically very active. With very high surface energy, they are
      both physically and chemically attracted to the hydrocarbon
      molecules in fuels and oils. At such very low concentrations as 50
      to 1000 ppm, they remain uniformly dispersed in fuels and act as
      self-lubricating entities. Such nanometer-sized particles may also
      be mixed or blended with lubricants such as oils, greases or
      combinations thereof; or polyethylene glycols, and combinations
      thereof, to achieve improved lubrication and superior
      anti-friction and wear properties in these products. FIG. 7 shows
      the lubricity performance of diesel fuels containing
      nanometer-sized boric acid powders in dispersion. It can be seen
      from the figure that treating ultra low-sulfur (3 ppm) diesel
      fuels with between about 500 and 1000 ppm nanometer-sized boric
      acid powders increases the lubricity performance of the fuel
      compared to untreated low and ultra low diesel fuels. In fact, as
      shown in the figure, the treated ultra low-sulfur fuels have a
      lubricity performance comparable to that of untreated high-sulfur
      diesel fuels. FIGS. 8, 9, and 10 show the lubricity performance,
      as measured by friction coefficients, of nanometer-sized boric
      acid powders mixed with various oils on steel and magnesium
      alloys. In these figures, lubricity performance is determined
      through friction coefficient measurements taken with a pin-on-disk
      instrument, as described in more detail in the Examples section
      below. Briefly, FIGS. 8-10 show that adding nanometer-sized boric
      acid powders to synthetic and paraffinic oils leads to a decrease
      in the friction coefficient, which corresponds to an increase in
      the lubricity performance of the oils.<br>
      <br>
      The invention is further described in the following non-limiting
      examples.<br>
      <br>

      </b><b> Preparation of Test Fuels and Oils Containing Boron
        Additives</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      Various fuels and oils were tested for lubricity by measurement of
      wear scar diameters and friction coefficients. These fuels were
      obtained by adding concentrated solutions of boron compounds to
      the fuel in quantities sufficient to provide a concentration of
      boron, boric acid and/or BO3 monomers of between 100 ppm and 2000
      ppm in the fuel composition. Similarly, oils were obtained by
      adding concentrated solutions of boron compounds to the oils in
      quantities sufficient to provide a concentration of boron, boric
      acid, and/or BO3 monomers of up to 8 percent by volume. In certain
      embodiments the boron compounds were present in an amount of
      between 0.1 and 8 percent by volume.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Fuel Wear Testing Protocol:</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      Lubricity additives were evaluated using wear scar diameter
      measurements. Friction and wear measurements were carried out
      using a ball-on-three-disk (BOTD) Fuel Lubricity Test Machine
      according to the standard conditions described below, and as shown
      in FIG. 2a. The data obtained with this testing apparatus under
      standard testing conditions show the improvement in diesel fuel
      lubricity that occurs when boron compounds such as boric acid are
      added to the fuel.<br>
      <br>
      Diesel fuel lubricity tests were conducted in a BOTD lubricity
      test machine whose detailed description can be found in C. D.
      Gray, G. D. Webster, R. M. Voitik, P. S T Pierre, and K. Michell,
      “Falex Ball-on-Three Disk (BOTD-M2) Used to Determine the Low
      Temperature Lubricity and Associated Characteristics of Lubricity
      Additives for Diesel Fuels,” Proc. 2&lt;nd &gt;Int. Colloquium on
      Fuels, W. J. Bartz, ed., Technische Akademie Esslingen, Ostfildem,
      Germany, pp. 211-217 (1999), which is herein incorporated by
      reference. In brief, the test configuration for the BOTD machine
      consists of a highly polished 12.7-mm-diameter alumina ball
      (Al2O3) pressed against three stationary 52100 grade steel flats
      under a load of 24.5 N, creating a peak Hertz pressure of about 1
      GPa. The steel disks were 6.35 mm in diameter and had a surface
      finish between 0.1 and 0.2 μm, root mean square. The Rockwell C
      hardness value of the steel disks was 57 to 63. The lubricant cup
      of the BOTD machine was filled with the diesel fuels, and the
      rubbing surfaces of the steel specimens were immersed in fuel
      throughout the tests. Rotational velocity of the ceramic ball was
      60 rpm and the test duration was 45 min. At the conclusion of each
      test, the dimensions of the wear scars on the flat steel specimens
      were measured by an optical microscope equipped with a digital
      micrometer display unit. The average wear scar diameters are
      expressed in mm. In terms of fuel lubricity and wear analyses,
      this is presently the most widely used procedure to assess the
      lubricity of diesel fuels.<br>
      <br>
      The BOTD Lubricity Test Machine shown in FIG. 2a was developed to
      evaluate the anti-wear performance of diesel fuels. The amount of
      wear achieved was measured during point to point contact of the
      test ball specimen under high load and rotational speed with each
      test diesel fuel as the lubricant. Average wear scar diameter on
      the flat 52100 test steel was measured in control fuels
      (respectively, high-sulfur diesel fuel containing 500 ppm sulfur,
      and low-sulfur diesel fuel containing 140 ppm) that did not
      contain any boron additive. The effect on average wear scar
      diameter of various boron additives according to the present
      invention was then measured in low-sulfur diesel fuel (0-140 ppm
      sulfur content), the test fuel having boron and/or boron compound
      concentrations of between 100 and 2000 ppm.<br>
      <br>
      When standard lubricity tests are performed on a diesel fuel
      having a sulfur content of from about 400 to about 800 ppm, the
      typical wear scar diameter forming on a flat 52100 steel is around
      0.35 mm. The data for untreated fuels appears in tables 1-4. The
      data show that Fischer Tropsch fuel (sulfur content of
      approximately zero) has the highest wear index of 0.75 mm scar
      diameter. Ultra low-sulfur fuel (3 ppm sulfur content) has a wear
      index of 0.57 mm. Low-sulfur diesel fuel (140 ppm sulfur content)
      has a wear scar index of 0.49 mm. Finally, high-sulfur diesel
      fuel, (500 ppm sulfur content) has the lowest wear index of 0.35
      mm.<br>
      <br>
      The change in lubricity and increase in wear was measured for
      fuels treated with various boron compounds. The data for these
      treated fuels appears in tables 1-4. The results demonstrate that
      diesel fuels of very low-sulfur content (140 ppm or lower sulfur
      content) with boric acid additive exhibited smaller wear scar
      diameters (in one case less than 0.28 mm) than did untreated fuels
      having the highest sulfur content (0.35 mm or greater wear scar
      diameter). It was concluded that low-sulfur fuels containing the
      boron additives of the present invention have increased lubricity
      compared to untreated high-sulfur fuels (500 ppm sulfur content).<br>
      <br>
      The effect of boric acid on low-sulfur diesel is dramatic. Table 1
      lists the changes in the wear scar diameter for different boric
      acid concentrations in low-sulfur diesel fuel. The effect upon
      average wear scar diameter of low-sulfur diesel fuel (having a
      sulfur content of 140 ppm) when an 18% concentrated methanol
      solution of boric acid is added to low-sulfur diesel fuel is shown
      in the table. The addition of the boron compound to the low-sulfur
      diesel fuel results in a dramatic increase in lubricity as
      indicated by the lower wear scar diameter.<br>

      FIG. 1 illustrates these values graphically, showing the effect on
      lubricity performance of a variation in boron concentration in the
      fuel between 100 ppm (3&lt;rd &gt;bar) and 2000 ppm (7thbar).
      Average wear scar diameters for two control fuels, high-sulfur
      diesel fuel (500 ppm) and low-sulfur diesel fuel (140 ppm), are
      shown by bars 1 and 2. It is evident from the graph that more
      lubricity is provided to low-sulfur diesel fuel (140 ppm) by
      adding methanol solutions of boric acid, than is conferred to
      diesel fuel by 500 ppm sulfur content.<br>

      shows that 500 ppm boric acid provides approximately the same

      high-sulfur diesel fuel (500 ppm), low-sulfur diesel fuel (140

      the amounts respectively of 250, 500, and 1000 ppm. The first two
      bars in FIG. 6a represent the average wear scar diameter for
      control diesel fuels having a sulfur content of 500 ppm and 0 ppm,
      respectively. Similarly, the first two bars in FIG. 6b represent
      the average wear scar diameter for control diesel fuels having a
      sulfur content of 500 ppm and 140 ppm, respectively. FIGS. 6a and
      6b both show that the addition of trimethoxyboroxin at a

      FIG. 7 graphically represents the effect of nanometer-sized boric
      acid powders on the lubricity performance of 3 ppm sulfur

      (3-100 nm) were produced by low pressure gas condensation and low
      temperature evaporation of ethyl borates or methanol or ethanol
      solutions of boric acid into or through the fuels or oils. The
      first three bars in FIG. 7 represent the average wear scar
      diameter for control diesel fuels having a sulfur content of 500
      ppm, 140 ppm, and 3 ppm, respectively. The remaining two bars show
      that the addition of nanometer-sized boric acid powders at
      concentrations between about 250 and about 1000 ppm results in a
      lowering of the average wear scar diameter.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Lubricant Friction Coefficient Testing Protocol:</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      In addition to evaluating diesel fuels using wear scar diameter
      measurements, lubricants were evaluated using friction coefficient
      measurements. Friction coefficient measurements were carried out
      using a pin-on-disk Test Machine according to the standard
      conditions described below. The testing apparatus and standard
      testing conditions show the improvement in lubricant lubricity
      that occurs when boron compounds such as boric acid are added to
      lubricants, such as oils and greases.<br>
      <br>
      Diesel fuel lubricity tests were conducted in a pin-on-disk test
      machine whose detailed description can be found in the 1990 Annual
      Book of ASTM Standards, Volume 3.02, pages 391-395, which is
      herein incorporated by reference. In brief, the machine consists
      of a stationary top-mounted pin that rubs against a unidirectional
      rotating disk or flat. The pins can be either flat pins,
      hemispherically tipped pins (typically, the pins that have a 5″
      radius ground onto one of the faces). Alternatively, 3⁄8″ or 1⁄2″
      diameter balls can be used. Disks up to approximately 3″ in
      diameter (approximately 1⁄4″ thick) can be tested on the machine.
      The chuck that holds the discs can also hold flats up to 2″×2″.
      The lubricants are applied to the disk surface, and the pins are
      rubbed against the disk. A load is applied to the pin by using
      dead weights. For the specific tests performed, 20 to 50 N loads
      were used and the sliding velocity of the rotating disk was
      adjusted to give linear velocities of 0.01 and 0.1 m/s. Tests were
      run at room temperature and in open air whose relative humidity
      varied between 30 and 60%. A schematic of this test system can be
      found in FIG. 2b.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 8 is a graph showing the effect upon the lubricity
      performance of nanometer-sized boric acid powders, which were
      sprayed on the surface of a steel disk, to pure synthetic oil
      (PAO).<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 9 is a graph showing the effect of nanometer-sized boric acid
      powders, which were sprayed on the surface of a steel disk, upon
      the lubricity performance of a paraffinic oil on a magnesium alloy
      sample.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 10 is a graph showing the effect of a nano-structured boric
      acid coating mixed with PAO upon the lubricity performance of a
      steel pin and boron-carbide coated steel disk test pair under
      lubricated sliding conditions. These coatings are prepared by
      either spraying of methanolic solutions of boric acid to the
      surface or chemically extracting them from the boron carbide
      coatings by a high temperature chemical conversion method as
      described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,840,132, which is herein incorporated
      by reference.<br>
      <br>
      As shown in FIGS. 8-10, the presence of nanometer-sized boric acid
      powders on a sliding surface significantly reduces the friction
      coefficient of the oil.<br>
      <br>
      Table 5 shows the changes in lubricity performance, as measured by
      both wear scar diameters and friction coefficients, for various
      test pairs when trimethoxyboroxin is added to a base mineral oil.
      The data in table 5 demonstrate that the addition of
      trimethoxyboroxin (5 percent by volume) to pure mineral oil
      dramatically decreases the friction coefficient and the wear scar
      diameter, which corresponds to an improvement in the lubricity
      performance of the oil.<br>

      consistent with improved lubricity performance of the oil.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 12 shows the effect of trimethoxyboroxin on lubrication

      FIG. 13 shows the effect of the addition of trimethoxyboroxin on
      the lubrication performance of a 50/50 mixture of sunflower oil
      and pure mineral oil. Finally, FIG. 14 shows the effect of the

      each case, the addition of trimethoxyboroxin dramatically
      decreased the friction coefficient and wear scar diameter.<br>

      Thus, in the data shown, both fuels and oils containing the boron

      This invention relates to carbon-based materials as anti-friction
      and anti-wear additives for advanced lubrication purposes. The

      hydrocarbon carrier. Optionally, the compositions further comprise
      a surfactant (e.g., to aid in dispersion of the carbon particles).

      <br>
      <b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      This invention relates to novel lubricant compositions comprising
      a particulate carbon material suspended in a liquid carrier, which
      provide beneficial anti-friction and anti-wear properties. The
      particulate materials have various shapes, sizes, and structures
      and are synthesized by autogenic reactions under extreme
      conditions of high temperature and pressure. Specifically, the
      lubricant compositions have the ability to significantly lower
      friction and wear, which translates into the advantages of
      improving the durability and fuel economies of motorized and
      mechanical devices.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The transportation share of U.S. energy consumption is around 28%
      (or 28.4 quadrillion Btu) with petroleum accounting for 96% of
      this amount (every day, the U.S. consumes about 13 million barrels
      of petroleum for transportation). Engine and drive-train friction
      accounts for 10-15% of the fuel's total energy used in current
      vehicles, which translates to about 1.3 to 2 million barrels of
      petroleum/day lost to friction alone. Furthermore, a significant
      amount of energy is spent to remanufacture and/or replace worn
      parts in these systems. In short, the energy efficiency,
      durability, and environmental compatibility of all motorized and
      mechanical devices are closely related to the effectiveness of the
      lubricants on rolling, rotating, and sliding contact surfaces.
      Poor or inefficient lubrication results in higher friction and
      severe wear losses, which in turn adversely impacts performance
      and durability [1]. In addition, lubricants can include additives
      such as viscosity index improvers, anti-oxidant agents,
      anti-corrosion agents, wear-protection agents, acid neutralizers,
      dispersants and the like to provide beneficial properties.<br>
      <br>
      The energy efficiency, durability, and environmental compatibility
      of all kinds of moving mechanical systems (including engines) are
      closely related to the effectiveness of the lubricants being used
      on their rolling, rotating, and sliding surfaces. Therefore,
      lubricants play a vital role in machine life, efficiency, and
      overall performance. Poor or inefficient lubrication always result
      in higher friction and severe wear losses, which can in turn
      adversely impact the performance and durability of mechanical
      systems. In particular, progressive wear due to inadequate
      lubrication is one of the most serious causes of component
      failure. Inadequate lubrication can also cause significant energy
      losses in the above-mentioned industrial systems mainly because of
      high friction.<br>
      <br>
      Currently, there are numerous solid lubricants available at sizes
      ranging from 1 nm to more than 500 nm in powder forms. The finer
      solids (i.e. 1 to 30 nm range) are mostly made of nanostructured
      carbons, like C60, nano-tubes, nano-fibers, and nano-onions while
      intermediate range lubricants (30 to 100 nm) are made of inorganic
      solids, such as MoS2, WS2, h-BN and pure metals (like gold,
      silver, tin, bismuth, etc.). WS2 is synthesized typically in the
      form of fullerene-like particles and hence it is often referred to
      as inorganic fullerene or, IF. Most of these materials are
      manufactured using a bottom-up approach involving multi-step
      chemical synthesis routes (e.g. gas phase chemical processing,
      combustion synthesis, sonochemistry, etc.) and the uses of
      environmentally unsafe chemicals. Many current processes also
      generate large amounts of toxic by-products to deal with after the
      manufacturing.<br>
      <br>
      There is an ongoing need for new lubricant compositions that are
      environmentally friendly or benign, and which provide reduced
      friction and wear. The present invention addresses this need.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The present invention relates to the development of various
      carbon-based additive materials for improving the anti-friction
      and anti-wear properties of lubricants, for example, in engine
      oils, diesel fuels and greases. Conventional lubricants do not yet
      meet the expectations of providing the performance requirements of
      motorized and mechanical devices. Carbon is an extremely versatile
      material that exists in numerous forms with diverse physical,
      chemical, electrical and electrochemical properties. Certain
      carbonaceous particles, such as carbon nano-onions, carbon
      nano-fibers, carbon nano-tubes and sub-micron graphite particles
      have all been considered for lubrication purposes in the past but
      they tend to be expensive, ineffective, and difficult to scale-up.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention relates to the design and development of
      novel carbon-based materials as anti-friction and anti-wear
      additives for advanced lubrication purposes. The carbon-based
      materials have various shapes, sizes, and structures and are
      synthesized by autogenic reactions under extreme conditions of
      high temperature and pressure. The materials of the invention are
      created typically by the dissociation of organic, organo-metallic
      or polymeric compounds, such as plastic waste in absence or
      presence of a catalyst in a closed, ventable reactor in which the
      pressure in the reactor is provided solely by vaporization of
      carbon-based precursors (i.e., autogenic pressure generation). The
      resulting carbon products are typically in the form of carbon
      nanotubes, fibers, spheres or clusters that can optionally contain
      elements such as B, Fe, Co, Ni, Mo, W, Ag, Au, Sn, Bi or their
      oxides, carbides, borides, nitrides and sulfides. Under severe
      tribological conditions, these carbon-based additives can improve
      lubrication properties without having a negative environmental
      impact. Specifically, the novel lubricants have the ability to
      significantly lower friction and wear, which can translate, for
      example, into improved fuel economies and longer durability of
      engines and mechanical devices.<br>
      <br>
      In one embodiment, the present invention provides a lubricant
      composition comprising carbon particles suspended in a liquid
      hydrocarbon carrier. The carbon particles are prepared by heating
      a neat, high or low density polyethylene-containing precursor
      composition in a sealed reactor at a temperature in the range of
      at least about 700° C. and under an autogenic, self generated
      pressure in the range of about 800 to about 2000 pounds-per-square
      inch (psi), subsequently cooling the reactor to less that 100° C.,
      and isolating the resulting particulate carbon material from the
      reactor. Preferably, the carbon particles are present in the
      composition at a concentration in the range of about 0.1 to about
      2 percent by weight (wt %), more preferably about 0.5 to about 1
      wt %.<br>
      <br>
      In some preferred embodiments, the composition further comprises a
      surfactant (e.g., to aid in suspension of the carbon particles.
      Non-limiting examples of suitable surfactants include non-ionic
      surfactants such as sorbitan trioleate. Other suitable surfactants
      include sorbitan sesquioleate (SSO) and Surfonic LF-17 (an
      ethoxylated and propoxylated linear C12-C12 alcohol). Preferably,
      the surfactant is present in the composition at a concentration in
      the range of about 1000 to about 20000 parts-per-million (ppm),
      more preferably about 5000 to about 10000 ppm.<br>
      <br>
      The liquid hydrocarbon carrier preferably comprises a poly(alpha
      olefin). Examples of suitable hydrocarbon carriers include
      poly(alpha olefin) materials. Preferred poly(alpha olefin)
      materials have a kinematic viscosity in the range of about 4 to
      about 10 centistokes (cSt) at about 100° C., e.g., about 4 cSt.<br>
      <br>
      In some preferred embodiments, the precursor composition of the
      carbon particles is high or low density polyethylene, and the
      particles are generally spherical in shape, not hollow, and have
      an average diameter in the range of about 1 to about 5
      micrometers. Optionally, the spherical particles can be
      heat-treated under an inert atmosphere at a temperature in the
      range of about 1000 to about 3000° C. prior to suspending in the
      liquid hydrocarbon carrier, and the carbon particles have a
      density of about 2 grams-per-cubic centimeter (g/cc) to about 2.3
      g/cc (e.g., about 2.1 g/cc).<br>
      <br>
      In other preferred embodiments, the precursor composition of the
      carbon particles the precursor composition comprises a combination
      of low or high density polyethylene and about 5 to about 20 wt %
      of a metal-containing compound. For example, the metal-containing
      compound can be a metal carboxylate salt, metal phosphate salt, a
      metal oxide, a metal sulfide, a metal carbine, a metal boride, a
      metal nitride, or an organometallic compound. Examples of suitable
      metals for the metal-containing compound include B, Fe, Co, Ni,
      Mo, W, Ag, Au, Sn, and Bi.<br>
      <br>
      In one preferred embodiment, the metal-containing compound
      comprises cobalt acetate, and the carbon particles comprise
      metallic cobalt nanoparticles with face-centered cubic crystal
      symmetry encapsulated within carbon nanotubes having an average
      tubular diameter of less than about 100 nm. When the
      metal-containing compound comprises ferrocene, the carbon
      particles comprise metallic iron nanoparticles with face-centered
      cubic crystal symmetry encapsulated at the tip of carbon nanotubes
      having an average tubular diameter of less than about 100 nm.<br>
      <br>
      Tribological studies of lubricant compositions of the present
      invention demonstrate a 30 to 40% reduction in wear relative to
      pure hydrocarbon-based lubricant is feasible even under severe
      sliding conditions. Reduction in friction was also substantial.
      Further improvements in lubrication properties can be expected by
      tailoring the reaction conditions and morphological properties of
      the carbon materials, for example, by graphitization of the carbon
      spheres or nanotubes, controlling particle size and surface
      properties to ensure that individual particles remain in
      suspension, preferably as a colloid through steric stabilization
      or electrostatic stabilization, to prevent aggregation of the
      particles. Overall, the lubricant compositions of the present
      invention have high potential to further enhance the lubricity of
      current lubricants formulations and hence improve the engine
      efficiency and performance of motorized and mechanical devices.
      Moreover, the autogenic processes described in this invention to
      prepare the carbon-based particle component of the lubricants is
      very versatile and can be used to synthesize a wide variety of
      nano-lubricant additive materials, such as boron oxides, metal
      sulfides, and the like.<br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The following examples are provided to illustrate certain
      preferred embodiments of the present invention, and are not to be
      considered a limiting the scope of the appended claims. The
      examples demonstrate, in particular, the versatility of autogenic
      reactions in synthesizing carbon-based materials with a diverse
      range of particle morphologies, conducive to their use as
      additives for lubrication technology.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Description of Test Equipment and Facilities</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Autogenic Reactor.</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The typical custom made reactor used in the making of the
      carbon-based additives can operate up to a maximum working
      pressure of about 2000 pounds per square inch and a maximum
      temperature of about 800° C. To fabricate the wide range of
      carbon-based materials in our invention, various autogenic
      reaction parameters such as heating rate, temperature, duration,
      reactant concentration, stoichiometry, pressure, and atmosphere
      (either oxidizing, reducing or inert) have to be carefully
      controlled. The additives can be synthesized either in amorphous
      or crystalline form. Moreover, the autogenic method can produce,
      in situ, distinct ‘core-shell’ materials, for example, those with
      a metal, metal alloy, or metal oxide core and an outer shell
      containing carbon moieties. Preferably, the reactor operates under
      conditions ranging from a minimum working pressure of about 100
      pounds per square inch and a minimum temperature of about 100° C.,
      to a maximum working pressure in the range of about 800 to about
      2000 pounds per square inch and a maximum temperature in the range
      of about 300 to about 800° C. The novel carbon additives produced
      by the specific reactor of this invention can be used in a wide
      range of lubrication applications, including, for example,
      internal combustion engines, wind turbines, compressors, space
      mechanisms, and hydraulics.<br>

      <b>Example 1</b><b><br>
      </b><b>Preparation of Carbon Spheres</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The controlled thermal decomposition of high density or low
      density polyethylene at about 700° C. for about 1 min to 3 hours
      in a closed reactor under autogenic (self-generating) pressure
      yielded solid carbon microspheres, approximately 1-5 μm in
      diameter, as illustrated in the scanning electron microscope
      images in FIG. 1, panels (a) and (b). The particles are almost
      perfectly spherical in shape and have smooth surfaces. The
      cross-section transmission electron micrograph confirmed that the
      carbon spheres are solid and not hollow (FIG. 1, panel c).
      Elemental C, H, N, S analyses showed that the carbon spheres are
      comprised of more than 98 wt. % carbon and less than 0.4 wt. %
      hydrogen; no significant amounts of N or S were detected. EDX
      elemental analyses confirmed that the spheres were essentially
      carbon; no impurities are detected by this method. The
      turbostratically disordered structure of the as-prepared spheres
      is reflected by the broad X-ray diffraction peaks centered at
      approximately 25, 42.3 and 44.3° 2θ that correspond to the
      layering (002), (100), and (101) reflections, respectively. The
      broad (002) peak, in particular, encompasses diffuse sets of
      interlayer distances that, on average, are larger than those in
      crystalline graphite (typically 0.344-0.355 nm). The high
      resolution transmission electron micrograph of a cross section of
      carbon spheres is depicted in FIG. 1d. The short order graphitic
      planes and some disorder are observed. The interlayer spacing
      results are analogous to XRD measurements.<br>
      <br>
      Raman spectra were obtained at room temperature using an In Via
      Raman spectrometer using 633 nm red laser with 10% intensity to
      determine the extent of graphitic disorder within the carbon
      spheres. The Raman spectrum of the as-prepared carbon spheres
      (FIG. 2a) is typical for a hard carbon, with a broad band at 1315
      cm&lt;−1 &gt;representing a highly disordered (D) graphite
      arrangement within the carbon spheres and a band at 1585
      cm&lt;−1&gt;, characteristic of a more ordered graphitic (G)
      structure. The D band has been attributed to the vibration of
      carbon atoms with dangling bonds for the in-plane terminated
      disordered graphite component. The G-band, corresponding to the
      E2g mode, is closely related to the vibration of sp&lt;2
      &gt;bonded carbon atoms in a 2-dimensional hexagonal lattice, as
      in graphene. Methodically measuring the peak heights of D and G
      bands, the ID/IG ratio was calculated for the carbonaceous
      materials. The intensity ratio of the D- and G-bands (ID/IG) of
      1.1 further quantifies the relative levels of disordered glassy
      carbons, indicating that the processing temperature at which the
      spheres were synthesized (700° C.) was not sufficiently high to
      allow for the alignment and growth of graphitic sheets within the
      carbon macrostructure. The graphitic content within the carbon
      spheres can be increased and controlled by subsequent heating in
      an inert atmosphere or under vacuum, for example, about 1000 to
      about 3000° C., preferably about 2000 to about 3000° C. to
      increase the inherent strength and toughness of the spheres. The
      transmission electron micrograph of the as-prepared carbon spheres
      showed a very smooth surface with several micrometer diameters
      (FIG. 2b). The BET (Brunauer, Emmett, Teller) surface area
      measurements were carried out using a Quantachrome Instrument
      after outgassing the carbon spheres at 150° C. for 12.0 hrs. The
      BET surface area of carbon sphere was measured to be 4.6
      m&lt;2&gt;/g, with a total pore volume of 0.0078 cc/g. The density
      measurements of carbon spheres were determined using an automatic
      density analyzer (Quantum Instruments, Ultrapyc 1200e at 22° C.)
      with purging He gas. The measured average density of carbon
      spheres was 2.3 g/cc, which is close to the theoretical value for
      graphitic carbon. The diffuse X-ray diffraction image due to an
      amorphous carbon product (FIG. 2c) is consistent with the Raman
      data.<br>
      <br>
      Furthermore, the above-mentioned carbon spheres prepared at 700°
      C. were heated at 2400° C. for 1 hour under inert conditions to
      enhance the graphitic character of the spheres. It is apparent
      from FIGS. 3a-b that the heat treatment process had a negligible
      effect on the spherical shape and overall morphology of the
      particles, confirming the remarkable stability of the spheres when
      heated to an extremely high temperature. EDX elemental analyses
      confirmed that the spheres were essentially carbon; no impurities
      could be detected by this method in both as-prepared and heated
      carbon spheres samples (FIG. 3c). The measured average density of
      heat treated carbon spheres is approximately 2.1 g/cc. The BET
      surface area of heated carbon spheres is reduced to 1.05
      m&lt;2&gt;/g after high temperature heat treatments (2400° C.) for
      1 hour in an inert atmosphere. The decrease in the surface area in
      the heated carbon spheres is attributed to the removal of pores
      during the high temperature treatment and sintering of the spheres
      that is believed to increase their strength and toughness. The XRD
      patterns of the heat-treated carbon sphere products are shown in
      FIG. 3d (top, (700° C.) and bottom (2400° C.), respectively). The
      increase in graphitic order on heating the carbon spheres to 2400°
      C. is observed. The increased strength and toughness of the heated
      carbon spheres is believed to account for the improved friction
      and wear behavior, as described more fully in the following
      sections. In particular, it is believed that the carbon spheres
      may act as ball bearings that employ a “rolling” mechanism to
      reduce the friction between sliding surfaces, and the wear
      thereof.<br>
      <br>
      <b> Example 2</b><b><br>
      </b><b> Synthesis of Cobalt Encapsulated Carbon Nanotubes</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      Using two different catalysts, carbon nanotubes were prepared
      under autogenic conditions. In the first case, the thermal
      decomposition of 2 g of low density polyethylene (LDPE) and 20 wt
      % cobalt acetate, Co(C2H3O2)2 catalyst was carried out by a
      similar procedure to that described above. Up to 680° C., the
      pressure within the reactor reached about 50 psi (3.4 atm) before
      increasing rapidly to 1000 psi (68 atm) at 700° C. At 700° C., the
      reactor was heated for 2 hours before being cooled to room
      temperature. The yield of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) was 40 wt. %.
      SEM images of the carbon nanotubes prepared by the thermolysis of
      low density polyethylene in the presence of a cobalt acetate
      catalyst, are shown in FIGS. 4a and 4b; the CNTs are several
      micrometers in length and have an average diameter of less than
      100 nm. The CNTs encapsulate nanosized metallic Co particles, less
      than 100 nm in size, as confirmed by transmission electron
      microscopy. X-ray diffraction data indicated that the carbon was
      largely graphitic in character and that the entrapped cobalt had
      face-centered-cubic symmetry (FIG. 4c). Similarly, the high
      density polyetheylene was used as a source of hydrocarbons for the
      production of carbon nanotubes under autogenic conditions.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 3</b><b><br>
      </b><b> Synthesis of Iron Encapsulated Carbon Nanotubes</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      Because cobalt is relatively expensive element, iron based
      catalysts were evaluated. For example, the thermal decomposition
      of 2 g of low density polyethylene (LDPE) and 20 wt % ferrocene,
      C10H10Fe catalyst at about 700° C. for about 3 hours in a closed
      reactor under autogenic (self generating) pressure yielded
      Fe-containing carbon nanotubes (CNTs). SEM images of these carbon
      nanotubes are shown in FIGS. 5a and 5b. The CNTs are several
      micrometers in length and have an average diameter of less than
      100 nm. The transmission electron micrograph of an individual CNT
      shows a cylindrical form (FIG. 5c) that encapsulates the iron
      nanoparticle catalyst at the tip of the tube. CNTs with an
      approximate 30 nm inner diameter and a shell thickness of 20 nm
      are depicted in the TEM image. X-ray diffraction data (inset in
      FIG. 5d) indicated that the carbon nanotubes were largely
      graphitic in character and that the entrapped iron had
      face-centered-cubic symmetry. Additionally, small reflection peaks
      belongs to Fe3C (marked with asterisks) were observed indicating
      that the carbide phase can be formed at relatively low temperature
      under autogenic conditions.<br>
      <br>
      These novel particles are derived from disposable plastics by the
      autogenic reaction process in the forms of spheres, tubes, tubes
      with metal encapsulation, and fibers. When mixed with appropriate
      lubricants, these particles have the capacity to significantly
      lower the friction and enhance wear resistance of sliding steel
      surfaces.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 4</b><b><br>
      </b><b> Tribological Testing of Conventional Base-Lubricants</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      Tribological testing was conducted using the Ball-on-Disc
      Tribo-tester as described herein. A base-lubricant of poly(alpha
      olefin) having a viscosity of about 4 centiStokes (cSt) was tested
      under these extreme conditions. As shown in the FIG. 6(a), there
      was high friction under all sliding speeds. Moreover, the friction
      was very high (0.16) under lowest speed test conditions.<br>
      <br>
      The wear of the sliding surfaces after testing in base lubricant
      is shown in FIG. 6(b). There was a large wear scar formed on the
      ball surface after the tribological test. The diameter of this
      wear scar was about 330 μm. The high wear was most likely the
      result of poor performance of the base-lubricant. Moreover, the
      wear scar was not covered with a protective boundary film; hence,
      it was shiny and metallic looking The roughness results are
      presented in FIG. 6(c). The wear scar had a roughness value of
      about 122 nm.<br>
      <br>
      The data indicate that the base-lubricant was unable to react with
      the sliding contact surfaces of ball and plate to form any type of
      protective boundary layer, and hence, resulted in high friction
      and high wear. The high friction affects efficiency and high wear
      affects durability of mechanical system. Thus, the base-lubricant
      was unable to provide any significant tribological advantages.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 5</b><b><br>
      </b><b> Tribological Testing of Carbon Sphere Based Lubricants</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      Tribological testing was conducted using the Ball-on-Disc
      Tribo-tester as described herein. The carbon spheres produced
      under the autogenic conditions of this invention as in Example 1
      were dispersed in the base-lubricant described in Example 4 at a
      concentration of about 1 wt % and then were tested under the
      extreme test conditions mentioned above. As shown in the FIG.
      7(a), there was substantial reduction in friction at all sliding
      speeds compared to the base-lubricant discussed in Example 4.
      Moreover, the friction was relatively moderate (0.12) under the
      lowest speed test conditions where more frequent metal-to-metal
      contacts occur.<br>
      <br>
      The wear result from the carbon sphere-based lubricant is shown in
      FIG. 7(b). There was a partially dark wear scar on the ball
      surface after tribological testing and the wear scar was much
      smaller (i.e., 230 μm) than the scar observed in the test in
      base-lubricant (FIG. 6(b)). The wear scar was covered (about 50%)
      with a protective film. The roughness results are presented in
      FIG. 7(c). The wear scar had lower roughness (about 83 nm) than
      what was measured on a wear scar created in pure base-lubricant.<br>
      <br>
      The data indicate that the carbon sphere-based lubricant was able
      to react with the contact surfaces of ball and plate to form a
      protective boundary layer. The wear scar was partially covered by
      a dark (black) layer of the carbon material, which resulted in
      reduction of friction and wear compared to the base-lubricant
      performance. The reduced friction can improve the efficiency while
      low wear enhances the durability of mechanical systems. Thus, the
      carbon sphere-based lubricant additive was able to provide
      superior friction and wear properties.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 6</b><b><br>
      </b><b> Tribological Testing of Carbon Fiber-Based Lubricants</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      Tribological testing was conducted using the Ball-on-Disc
      Tribo-tester as described herein. Carbon fiber materials (about 1
      wt %) produced under autogenic conditions were dispersed in the
      base-lubricant described in Example 4 and then tested under the
      extreme conditions of the Ball-on-Disc test. As shown in the FIG.
      8(a), there was a marked reduction in the friction coefficient
      under all steps of sliding speed compared to what was observed
      from the base-lubricant alone. Moreover, the friction was still
      reasonable (i.e., 0.12) under the lowest speed test conditions.<br>
      <br>
      Wear results for the carbon fiber-based lubricant is presented in
      FIG. 8(b). There was a significantly smaller and darker wear scar
      formed on the sliding ball surface after tribological tests. The
      actual size of the wear scar was about 190 μm in size compared to
      330 um diameter wear scar formed during tests with the
      base-lubricant alone (FIG. 6(b)). The wear scar was mostly covered
      (about 70%) with a protective darker-looking carbon film. The
      roughness results are presented in FIG. 8(c). The wear scar had a
      roughness value of about 115 nm.<br>
      <br>
      It is believed that the carbon fiber-based lubricant was able to
      react with the sliding contact surfaces of ball and plate to form
      a highly protective carbon-rich boundary layer. Formation of such
      a boundary film resulted in the reduction of friction and wear
      compared to the base-lubricant performance. The reduction in
      friction improves the efficiency and low wear enhances the
      durability of the mechanical system. Thus, the new carbon
      fiber-based lubricant provided excellent tribological results.<br>

      It was demonstrated in Example 5 that carbon spheres (heat-treated
      at 700° C.) provided good tribological performance when used as an
      additive to a base-lubricant. However, there were two factors that
      may have limited optimum performance, i.e., (1) dispersibility of
      the carbon particles in the carrier oil over an extended period of
      time, and (2) relatively higher friction values under extreme
      boundary conditions.<br>
      <br>
      In order to keep the carbon particles suspended in the carrier
      oil, a surfactant was added (sorbitan trioleate (STO) about 10000
      ppm), which provided very good performance and very consistent and
      long-duration shelf life without particle agglomeration,
      separation or settlement. It is believed that the particles were
      covered by the hydrophilic chains of STO, and therefore, increased
      the homogeneous dispersion/suspension of the carbon sphere
      particles in the base-lubricant.<br>
      <br>
      Tribological tests were conducted under severe line contact
      conditions and at high temperatures using the High Frequency
      reciprocating rig (HFRR Tribo-tester) as described herein. As
      shown in FIG. 9, there was a 30% reduction in the friction when
      the carbon sphere additive and STO based lubricant composition was
      used, when compared to the carbon sphere-based lubricant alone.
      Addition of surfactant (STO) to the carbon sphere-based lubricant
      additive of this invention significantly improved the
      dispersibility of the carbon spheres and it was also able to
      further improve the friction performance of the carbon
      sphere-based lubricant composition.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 8</b><b><br>
      </b><b> Improved Performance of Carbon Fiber-Based Lubricants</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      Tribological tests under extreme severe line contact conditions
      were conducted using the High Frequency reciprocating rig (HFRR
      Tribo-tester) as in Example 7. Carbon-fiber particles produced by
      the autogenic reactions of this invention were dispersed in the
      base-lubricant with and without the STO surfactant (10000 ppm) and
      then tested under these extreme conditions. As shown in the FIG.
      10, there was a 30% reduction in friction when the carbon sphere
      and STO based lubricant compared to the carbon fiber-based
      lubricant without surfactant. Addition of the STO surfactant to
      the carbon fiber-based lubricant additive of this invention
      significantly improved the dispersion/suspension of the carbon
      spheres and the friction performance of the carbon fiber based
      lubricant.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 9</b><b><br>
      </b><b> Improved Performance of High-Temperature Treated Carbon
        Sphere-Based Lubricants</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      Tribological tests were conducted under severe line contact
      conditions and at high temperatures using the High Frequency
      reciprocating rig (HFRR Tribo-tester) as in Example 7 and 8. Heat
      treated carbon spheres produced under autogenic conditions as in
      Example 1 were dispersed in the base-lubricant (at a concentration
      of about 1 wt %) with and without the STO surfactant (10000 ppm)
      and then tested under the severe test conditions mentioned above.
      As shown in FIG. 11, there was a 30% reduction in the friction of
      this carbon sphere- and STO-based lubricant composition compared
      to the carbon sphere-based lubricant alone. Moreover, there was
      excellent wear resistance offered by these carbon spheres
      (heat-treated at 2400° C.) with, and without, surfactant. Carbon
      spheres heat-treated at 2400° C. provided excellent
      wear-resistance compared to carbon spheres heat-treated at 700° C.
      thereby indicating the benefit of heating the carbon spheres to
      significantly high temperatures (2000-3000° C.) prior to use.
      Addition of the STO surfactant to the carbon sphere-based
      lubricant significantly improved the dispersibility of the carbon
      spheres; it also further improved the friction properties of the
      carbon sphere-based lubricant composition.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 10</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      Although the carbon materials produced by autogenic reactions
      offered excellent tribological performance, there are several ways
      to optimize their properties even further. Treatment of particles
      with surfactants did influence the surface chemistry of these
      particles and hence their interactions with sliding surfaces. In
      particular, the addition of polar surfactants into the carrier
      oils improved the interaction of the particles. Sorbitan trioleate
      (STO), provided a very desirable performance (FIG. 9, FIG. 10 and
      FIG. 11). When STO was added to the carbon particle-containing
      blends, the friction was reduced by 30%. The reason for this good
      performance may be attributed to the hydrophilic sorbitan portion
      of the STO surfactant enhancing the interaction of the carbon
      particles with the steel surfaces, and keeping the particles
      uniformly dispersed in the base oils. The hydrophobic oleate
      portion of the molecule likely participates in the tribochemical
      reaction along with carbon particles and forms durable boundary
      films on the sliding surfaces.<br>
      <br>
      A high resolution transmission electron microscopy image in
      cross-section, using the Focused Ion Beam (FIB) technique, of the
      reaction or boundary film resulting from the reaction of the
      carbon spheres with the STO-MO surfactant is shown in FIG. 12. The
      reaction or boundary film looks rather thick, featureless and
      discreet on the steel surface. The reaction film was distinctly
      darker in color, suggesting that the film was carbon-rich due to
      carbon sphere interaction. Moreover, the reaction film was more
      than 200 nm thick, suggesting very robust processes that lead to
      the formation of such reaction films. Thus, it appears that the
      addition of the STO surfactant to the carbon sphere-based
      lubricant provides excellent tribological performance due to the
      enhanced interaction of the lubricant with the sliding surface to
      form a highly durable and protective boundary film.<br>

      This invention relates to carbon-based materials as anti-friction
      and anti-wear additives for advanced lubrication purposes. The
      materials have various shapes, sizes, and structures and are
      synthesized by autogenic reactions under extreme conditions of
      high temperature and pressure. The lubricant compositions comprise
      carbon-based particles suspended in a liquid hydrocarbon carrier.
      Optionally, the compositions further comprise a surfactant (e.g.,
      to aid in dispersion of the carbon particles). Specifically, the
      novel lubricants have the ability to significantly lower friction
      and wear, which translates into improved fuel economies and longer
      durability of mechanical devices and engines.<br>
