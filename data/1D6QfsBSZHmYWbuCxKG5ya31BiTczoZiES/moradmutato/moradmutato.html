      “We believe we will offer in a year’s time a complete cure for
      cancer,” said Dan Aridor, of a new treatment being developed by
      his company, Accelerated Evolution Biotechnologies Ltd. (AEBi),
      which was founded in 2000 in the ITEK incubator. AEBi developed
      the SoAP platform, which provides functional leads to very
      difficult targets.<br>
      <br>
      “Our cancer cure will be effective from day one, will last a
      duration of a few weeks and will have no or minimal side-effects
      at a much lower cost than most other treatments on the market,”
      Aridor said. “Our solution will be both generic and personal.”<br>
      <br>
      It sounds fantastical, especially considering that an estimated
      18.1 million new cancer cases are diagnosed worldwide each year,
      according to reports by the International Agency for Research on
      Cancer. Further, every sixth death in the world is due to cancer,
      making it the second leading cause of death (second only to
      cardiovascular disease).<br>
      <br>
      Aridor, chairman of the board of AEBi and CEO Dr. Ilan Morad, say
      their treatment, which they call MuTaTo (multi-target toxin) is
      essentially on the scale of a cancer antibiotic – a disruption
      technology of the highest order.<br>
      <br>
      The potentially game-changing anti-cancer drug is based on SoAP
      technology, which belongs to the phage display group of
      technologies. It involves the introduction of DNA coding for a
      protein, such as an antibody, into a bacteriophage – a virus that
      infects bacteria. That protein is then displayed on the surface of
      the phage. Researchers can use these protein-displaying phages to
      screen for interactions with other proteins, DNA sequences and
      small molecules.<br>
      <br>
      In 2018, a team of scientists won the Nobel Prize for their work
      on phage display in the directed evolution of new proteins – in
      particular, for the production of antibody therapeutics.<br>
      <br>
      AEBi is doing something similar but with peptides, compounds of
      two or more amino acids linked in a chain. According to Morad,
      peptides have several advantages over antibodies, including that
      they are smaller, cheaper, and easier to produce and regulate.<br>
      <br>
      When the company first started, Morad said, “We were doing what
      everyone else was doing, trying to discover individual novel
      peptides for specific cancers.” But shortly thereafter, Morad and
      his colleague, Dr. Hanan Itzhaki, decided they wanted to do
      something bigger.<br>
      <br>
      To get started, Morad said they had to identify why other
      cancer-killing drugs and treatments don’t work or eventually fail.
      Then, they found a way to counter that effect.<br>
      <br>
      For starters, most anti-cancer drugs attack a specific target on
      or in the cancer cell, he explained. Inhibiting the target usually
      affects a physiological pathway that promotes cancer. Mutations in
      the targets – or downstream in their physiological pathways –
      could make the targets not relevant to the cancer nature of the
      cell, and hence the drug attacking it is rendered ineffective.<br>
      <br>
      In contrast, MuTaTo is using a combination of several
      cancer-targeting peptides for each cancer cell at the same time,
      combined with a strong peptide toxin that would kill cancer cells
      specifically. By using at least three targeting peptides on the
      same structure with a strong toxin, Morad said, “we made sure that
      the treatment will not be affected by mutations; cancer cells can
      mutate in such a way that targeted receptors are dropped by the
      cancer.”<br>
      <br>
      “The probability of having multiple mutations that would modify
      all targeted receptors simultaneously decreases dramatically with
      the number of targets used,” Morad continued. “Instead of
      attacking receptors one at a time, we attack receptors three at a
      time – not even cancer can mutate three receptors at the same
      time.”<br>
      s. The cells pump out the drugs or modify them to be
      non-functional. But Morad said detoxification takes time. When the
      toxin is strong, it has a high probability of killing the cancer
      cell before detoxification occurs, which is what he is banking on.<br>
      <br>
      Many cytotoxic anticancer treatments aim at fast-growing cells.
      But cancer stem cells are not fast growing, and they can escape
      these treatments. Then, when the treatment is over, they can
      generate cancer again.<br>

      The present invention provides constructs comprising a plurality
      of peptides capable of targeting at least two different
      extracellular tumor antigens and a toxin, optionally connected to
      an organic scaffold. Use of such constructs in treating cancer are
      provided as well. The invention also provides particular peptides
      binding certain extracellular tumor antigens as well as toxins
      having antitumor activity.<br>
      <br>
      <b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0001] The invention relates to constructs comprising a plurality
      of peptides capable of targeting at least two different
      extracellular tumor antigens and at least one toxin, optionally
      connected to an organic scaffold and use of such constructs in
      treating cancer are provided as well. The invention also relates
      to particular peptides binding certain extracellular tumor
      antigens as well as toxins having antitumor activity, and
      conjugates of these peptides and toxins.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0002] Targeted cancer therapies are drugs or other substances
      designed to interfere with specific molecules involved in cancer
      cell growth and survival. In contrast to traditional chemotherapy
      drugs, which usually act against all actively dividing cells, a
      primary goal of targeted therapies is to fight cancer cells with
      more precision and potentially fewer side effects. Targeted cancer
      therapies that have been approved for use against specific cancers
      include agents that prevent cell growth signaling, interfere with
      tumor blood vessel development, promote the death of cancer cells,
      stimulate the immune system to destroy cancer cells, and deliver
      toxic drugs to cancer cells. The latter mainly includes monoclonal
      antibodies that deliver toxic molecules. Once the antibody has
      bound to its target cell, the toxic molecule that is linked to the
      antibody, such as a radioactive substance, a toxic polypeptide or
      a poisonous chemical, is taken up by the cell, ultimately killing
      that cell. The toxin will not affect cells that lack the target
      for the antibody.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] Efficient tumor targeting is challenging for a number of
      reasons. First, it requires identifying a target that is
      sufficiently specific to the tumor cells to avoid as much as
      possible non-specific killing of cells. In addition, cancer cells
      tend to be variable, both between cancer types and within the same
      type of cancer: the expression pattern of surface targets may vary
      between cells of a particular tumor. Cancer cells may also alter
      expression of their cell surface receptors during tumor
      development or become resistant to the therapy. Resistance may
      occur in two ways: the target itself changes through mutation so
      that the targeted therapy no longer interacts well with it, and/or
      the tumor finds a new pathway to achieve tumor growth that does
      not depend on the target. Most anti-cancer drugs attack a specific
      target on, or in, the cancer cell. Inhibiting the target usually
      aims to block a physiological pathway that promotes cancer.
      Mutations in the targets, or in their downstream physiological
      pathways, make the targets not relevant to the cancerous nature of
      the cell.<br>

      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0063] The present invention relates to therapeutic constructs
      comprising a plurality of multi-target peptides and at least one
      toxin moiety. In particular, a construct according to the present
      invention comprises a plurality of peptides each directed against
      a different cell-target. Peptides contained in a construct
      according to the invention are capable of binding, blocking,
      inhibiting, or activating at least two different antigens
      expressed on the membrane of cancer cells. The present invention
      provides, according to one aspect, a construct comprising at least
      two different peptides binding to at least two different
      extracellular tumor antigens, and at least one toxin, wherein the
      peptides and the toxin are covalently bound directly or through a
      carrier.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] The term "peptide" refers to a short chain of amino acid
      residues linked by peptide bonds, i.e., a covalent bond formed
      between the carboxyl group of one amino acid and an amino group of
      an adjacent amino acid. The term "peptide" refers to short
      sequences having up to 50 amino acids. A chain of amino acids
      monomers longer than 50 amino acid is referred as a "polypeptide".
      Such polypeptides, when having more than 50 amino acid residues,
      can also be classified as proteins, more particularly, proteins of
      low or medium molecular weight. [0065] The term "peptide"
      encompasses also the term "peptide analog". The term "peptide
      analog" and "analog" are used herein interchangeably and refer to
      an analog of a peptide having at least 70% identity with the
      original peptide, wherein the analog retains the activity of the
      original peptide. Thus, the terms "analog" and "active analog" may
      be used interchangeably. The term " "analog" refer to a peptide
      which contains substitutions, rearrangements, deletions, additions
      and/or chemical modifications in the amino acid sequence of the
      parent peptide. The term "analog" refers also to analogs of
      peptide toxins, i.e. toxins being peptides. According to some
      embodiments, the peptide analog has at least 80%, at least 90% or
      at least 95% sequence identity to the original peptide. According
      to one embodiment, the analog has about 70% to about 95%, about
      80% to about 90% or about 85% to about 95% sequence identity to
      the original peptide. According to some embodiments, the analog of
      the present invention comprises the sequence of the original
      peptide in which 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 substitutions were made.<br>
      <br>
      [0066] The substitutions of the amino acids may be conservative or
      non-conservative substitution. The non-conservative substitution
      encompasses substitution of one amino acid by any other amino
      acid. In one particular embodiment, the amino acid is substituted
      by a non-natural amino acid.<br>
      <br>
      [0067] The term "amino acid" as used herein refers to an organic
      compound comprising both amine and carboxylic acid functional
      groups, which may be either a natural or non- natural amino acid.
      The twenty two natural amino acids are aspartic acid (Asp),
      tyrosine (Tyr), leucine (Leu), tryptophan (Trp), arginine (Arg),
      valine (Val), glutamic acid (Glu), methionine (Met), phenylalanine
      (Phe), serine (Ser), alanine (Ala), glutamine (Gin), glycine
      (Gly), proline (Pro), threonine (Thr), asparagine (Asn), lysine
      (Lys), histidine (His), isoleucine (He), cysteine (Cys),
      selenocysteine (Sec), and pyrrolysine (Pyl). Non- limiting
      examples of non-natural amino acids include diaminopropionic acid
      (Dap), diaminobutyric acid (Dab), ornithine (Orn), aminoadipic
      acid, β-alanine, 1- naphthylalanine, 3-(l-naphthyl)alanine,
      3-(2-naphthyl)alanine, γ-aminobutiric acid (GABA), 3-(aminomethyl)
      benzoic acid, p-ethynyl-phenylalanine, p-propargly-oxy-
      phenylalanine, m-ethynyl-phenylalanine, p-bromophenylalanine,
      p-iodophenylalanine, p-azidophenylalanine, p-acetylphenylalanine,
      azidonorleucine, 6 -ethynyl- tryptophan, 5- ethynyl-tryptophan,
      3-(6-chloroindolyl)alanine, 3-(6-bromoindolyl)alanine, 3-(5-
      bromoindolyl)alanine, azidohomo alanine, p-chlorophenylalanine,
      a-aminocaprylic acid, O-methyl-L-tyrosine,
      N-acetylgalactosamine-a-threonine, and N-acetylgalactosamine-
      α-serine. According to one embodiment, the substitution is
      substitution with a non- natural amino acid.<br>
      <br>
      [0068] According to some embodiments, the term "analog"
      encompasses also the term "conservative analog".<br>
      <br>
      [0069] Conservative substitutions of amino acids as known to those
      skilled in the art are within the scope of the present invention.
      Conservative amino acid substitutions include replacement of one
      amino acid with another having the same type of functional group
      or side chain, e.g., aliphatic, aromatic, positively charged,
      negatively charged. One of skill will recognize that individual
      substitutions, is a "conservatively modified analog" where the
      alteration results in the substitution of an amino acid with a
      chemically similar amino acid. Conservative substitution tables
      providing functionally similar amino acids are well known in the
      art. One typical example of conservative substitution is provided
      below.<br>
      <br>
      [0070] The following six groups each contain amino acids that are
      conservative substitutions for one another: (1) Alanine (A),
      Serine (S), Threonine (T); (2) Aspartic acid (D), Glutamic acid
      (E); (3) Asparagine (N), Glutamine (Q); (4) Arginine (R), Lysine
      (K); (5) Isoleucine (I), Leucine (L), Methionine (M), Valine (V);
      and (6) Phenylalanine (F), Tyrosine (Y), Tryptophan (W). In other
      embodiments, the conservative substitution encompass substitution
      with a chemically similar non-natural amino acid.<br>
      <br>
      [0071] Thus, in some embodiments, the analog is a conservative
      analog of the peptide. According to some embodiments, the
      conservative analog of the present invention comprises the
      sequence of the original peptide in which 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5
      conservative substitutions were made. According to another
      embodiment, the analog consists of the amino acid sequence of the
      original peptide in which 1 , 2 or 3 conservative substitution
      were made. Thus, the analog consists of the amino acid sequence of
      the original peptide with 1, 2 or 3 conservative substitutions.<br>
      <br>
      [0072] The term "peptide" encompasses also the term "peptide
      fragment". The term "fragment" refers to a fragment of the
      original peptide or of an analog thereof wherein said fragment
      retains the activity of the original peptide or analog. Thus, the
      terms "fragment" and "active fragment" may be used
      interchangeably. According to some embodiments, the fragment
      consists of at least 6, at least 8, at least 9, or at least 10
      consecutive amino acids of the original sequence or of an analog
      thereof. According to one embodiment, the fragment consists of 6
      to 11, 7 to 10 or 8 to 9 consecutive amino acids of the original
      sequence or analog thereof.<br>
      <br>
      [0073] The peptides, analogs and fragments of present invention
      may be produced by any method known in the art, including
      recombinant (for peptides consisting of genetically encoded amino
      acids) and synthetic methods. Synthetic methods include exclusive
      solid phase synthesis, partial solid phase synthesis, fragment
      condensation, or classical solution synthesis. Solid phase peptide
      synthesis procedures are well known to one skilled in the art.
      Synthetic methods to produce peptides include but are not limited
      to FMOC solid phase peptide synthesis described, for example in
      Fields G. B., Noble R., Int. J. Pept. Protein Res., 35 : 161-214,
      1990. Methods for synthesizing peptides on PEG are described for
      example in DeNardo et al. Ibid.<br>
      <br>
      [0074] In some embodiments, synthetic peptides are purified by
      preparative high performance liquid chromatography and the peptide
      sequence is confirmed via amino acid sequencing by methods known
      to one skilled in the art.<br>
      <br>
      [0075] In some embodiments, recombinant protein techniques, well
      known in the art, are used to generate peptides and peptide
      multimers (consisting of genetically encoded amino acids) of the
      present invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0076] As used herein, the term "toxin" refers to a peptide or
      polypeptide substance which is poisonous, harmful or toxic
      (cytotoxic) to mammalian cells, such as human cells. The toxin
      according to the present invention may be originated from living
      organism such as a microorganism, plant, or higher organism, or
      which may be synthetically prepared, produced, or designed using
      any known technique, for example as described in WO 2007/010525.
      The toxin typically interacts with cellular biological
      macromolecules such as enzymes and receptors to mediate its
      effect. The term encompasses biologically active subunits or
      fragments of a toxin. According to certain embodiments, the toxin
      is a peptide toxin, consisting of up to 50 amino acids. According
      to some embodiments, the toxin being a peptide may be a cyclic
      peptide. For the sake of clarity, the toxin being a cyclic peptide
      is referred as a "cyclotoxin" or "cyclic toxin". Within a
      construct of the present invention, a toxin moiety confers at
      least some of its properties to the construct, and the construct
      mediates poisonous or harmful effects on the target cells. None
      limiting examples of peptide toxin include cyanobacteria toxins
      such as Microcystins and Nodularins, ProTx-I and ProTx-II toxins,
      snake venom-derived disintegrins such as Viperistatin or fragments
      thereof, and Hm-1 and Hm-2 toxins. [0077] The terms "carrier"
      refers to any molecule that covalently binds or capable of binding
      to the at least two different peptides and/or a toxin. Several
      possible binding arrangements are encompassed. According to one
      embodiment, one peptide and one toxin are bound via a carrier and
      the second peptide is bound directly to the first peptide or to
      the toxin. According to another embodiment, two peptides are bound
      via a carrier, and the toxin is bound to one of the peptides.
      According to a further embodiment, all peptides and toxin(s) are
      covalently bound to a carrier.<br>
      <br>
      [0078] According to any one of the above embodiment, the peptides
      and/or the toxin(s) are bound via a linker. The terms "linker" and
      "spacer" are used herein interchangeably and refer to any molecule
      that covalently binds and therefore linking two molecules.
      Non-limiting examples of the linker are amino acids, peptides, or
      any other organic substance that can be used to allow distance
      between two linked molecules.<br>
      <br>
      [0079] As used herein, the terms "target" and "cell target" refer
      to molecules found on cancer cells that may be a marker of cancer
      cell and may be involved in cancer cell growth, proliferation,
      survival and metastasis development. Particular examples of
      targets include cell-surface proteins, which upon binding to their
      counterparts, such as ligands, initiate a cascade that promotes
      tumor growth and development. A target according to the present
      invention is optionally highly expressed on cancer cells and not
      found, or found in substantially lower levels, on normal
      non-cancerous cells. The term "target" encompass therefore the
      term "extracellular tumor antigen". The term "tumor antigen" or
      "extracellular tumor antigen" are used herein interchangeably and
      include both tumor associated antigens (TAAs) and tumor specific
      antigens (TSAs). A tumor- associated antigen means an antigen that
      is expressed on the surface of a tumor cell in higher amounts than
      is observed on normal cells or an antigen that is expressed on
      normal cells during fetal development. A tumor specific antigen is
      an antigen that is unique to tumor cells and is not expressed on
      normal cells. The term tumor antigen includes TAAs or TSAs that
      have been already identified and those that have yet to be
      identified and includes fragments, epitopes and any and all
      modifications to the tumor antigens.<br>
      <br>
      [0080] As used herein, the term "cell-targeting", when referring
      to a moiety, particularly a peptide, that is part of a construct
      of the present invention, indicates that the peptide provides
      cell-, tissue- or organ-specific targeting. In particular, a
      cell-targeting peptide specifically recognizes and binds a cell
      target on cancer cells. By virtue of its binding, the
      cell-targeting peptide directs the entire construct to the
      cancerous tissue, to facilitate specific killing/inhibition of
      cancerous cells. Killing/inhibition of cancerous cells is
      typically affected via the toxin present in the construct, but in
      some embodiments it may be affected directly by the binding of the
      cell-targeting peptide.<br>
      <br>
      [0081] In one embodiment, the present invention provides a
      construct comprising at least two different peptides binding to at
      least two different extracellular tumor antigens, and at least one

      directly or through a carrier. According to some embodiments, the
      construct comprises at least 3 different said peptides. According
      to other embodiments, the construct comprises at least 4 different
      said peptides. According to certain embodiments, the construct
      comprises two or more different peptides binding to two or more
      different extracellular tumor antigens. According to one
      embodiment, the construct comprises three or more different
      peptides binding to three or more different extracellular tumor
      antigens. According to another embodiment, the construct comprises
      4 or more different peptides binding to 4 or more different
      extracellular tumor antigens.<br>
      <br>
      [0082] Not limiting examples of the extracellular tumor antigens

      receptor, Cadherin, CXCR4, CTLA- 4, CD2, CD19, endothelin
      receptor, ERBB4, FGFR, folate receptor, HER4, HGFR, Mucin 1 ,
      OGFR, PD-1 , PD-L2, PDGFR, and VEGFR, thus according to one
      embodiment, at least one of the peptides binds specifically to one
      such extracellular tumor antigen.<br>
      <br>
      [0083] According to some embodiments, at least one of the peptides
      binds specifically to an extracellular tumor antigens selected
      from Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) or programmed
      death-ligand 1 (PD-L1). The terms "PD-L1" and "human PD- Ll" are
      used herein interchangeably. The terms "EGFR" and "human EGFR" are
      used herein interchangeably.<br>
      <br>
      [0084] According to other embodiments, the other one of the at

      <br>
      [0087] According to any one of the above embodiments, the peptide

      peptide" and "cyclopeptide" are used herein interchangeably and
      refer to a peptide having an intramolecular bond between two
      non-adjacent amino acids. The cyclization can be effected through
      a covalent or non-covalent bond. Intramolecular bonds include, but
      are not limited to, backbone to backbone, side-chain to backbone
      and side-chain to side-chain bonds. According to some embodiments,
      the cyclization occurs between the cysteines of the peptide,
      analogs of fragments. According to other embodiments, the
      cyclization occurs between the N- terminal and C-terminal amino
      acids.<br>

      <br>
      [0143] According to another aspect, the present invention provides
      a composition comprising a construct of the present invention.
      According to one embodiment, the composition is a pharmaceutical
      composition. Thus, in some embodiments, the present invention
      provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a construct of
      the present invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient.
      All definitions, terms and embodiments of previous aspects are
      explicitly encompassed by this aspect.<br>
      <br>
      [0144] The term "pharmaceutical composition" as used herein refers
      to a composition comprising the construct of the present invention
      as disclosed herein optionally formulated with one or more
      pharmaceutically acceptable excipients.<br>
      <br>
      [0145] Formulation of the pharmaceutical composition may be
      adjusted according to applications. In particular, the
      pharmaceutical composition may be formulated using a method known
      in the art so as to provide rapid, continuous or delayed release
      of the active ingredient after administration to mammals. For
      example, the formulation may be any one selected from among
      plasters, granules, lotions, liniments, lemonades, aromatic
      waters, powders, syrups, ophthalmic ointments, liquids and
      solutions, aerosols, extracts, elixirs, ointments, fluidextracts,
      emulsions, suspensions, decoctions, infusions, ophthalmic
      solutions, tablets, suppositories, injections, spirits, capsules,
      creams, troches, tinctures, pastes, pills, and soft or hard
      gelatin capsules.<br>
      <br>
      [0146] The term "pharmaceutically acceptable carrier" or
      "pharmaceutically acceptable excipient" as used herein refers to
      any and all solvents, dispersion media, preservatives,
      antioxidants, coatings, isotonic and absorption delaying agents,
      surfactants, fillers, disintegrants, binders, diluents,
      lubricants, glidants, pH adjusting agents, buffering agents,
      enhancers, wetting agents, solubilizing agents, surfactants,
      antioxidants the like, that are compatible with pharmaceutical
      administration. Non-limiting examples of suitable excipients are
      example, water, saline, phosphate buffered saline (PBS), dextrose,
      glycerol, ethanol, or the like and combinations thereof. Other
      suitable carriers are well known to those skilled in the art. The
      use of such media and agents for pharmaceutically active
      substances is well known in the art. The compositions may contain
      other active compounds providing supplemental, additional, or
      enhanced therapeutic functions.<br>
      <br>
      [0147] The constructs of the present invention could be, according
      to some embodiments, suspended in a sterile saline solution for
      therapeutic uses. Numerous suitable drug delivery systems are
      known and include, e.g., implantable drug release systems,
      hydrogels, hydroxymethylcellulose, microcapsules, liposomes,
      microemulsions, microspheres, and the like. Controlled release
      preparations can be prepared through the use of polymers to
      complex or adsorb the molecule according to the present invention.
      For example, biocompatible polymers include matrices of
      poly(ethylene-co-vinyl acetate) and matrices of a polyanhydride
      copolymer of a stearic acid dimer and sebaric acid. The rate of
      release of the molecule according to the present invention from
      such a matrix depends upon the molecular weight of the molecule,
      the amount of the molecule within the matrix, and the size of
      dispersed particles.<br>
      <br>
      [0148] The pharmaceutical composition of the present invention may
      be administered by any know method. The terms "administering" or
      "administration of a substance, a compound or an agent to a
      subject can be carried out using one of a variety of methods known
      to those skilled in the art. For example, a compound or an agent
      can be administered, intravenously, arterially, intradermally,
      intramuscularly, intraperitonealy, intravenously, subcutaneously,
      ocularly, sublingually, orally (by ingestion), intranasally (by
      inhalation), intraspinally, intracerebrally, and transdermally (by
      absorption, e.g., through a skin duct). A compound or agent can
      also appropriately be introduced by rechargeable or biodegradable
      polymeric devices or other devices, e.g., patches and pumps, or
      formulations, which provide for the extended, slow or controlled
      release of the compound or agent. Administering can also be
      performed, for example, once, a plurality of times, and/or over
      one or more extended periods. In some embodiments, the
      administration includes both direct administration, including
      self- administration, and indirect administration, including the
      act of prescribing a drug. For example, as used herein, a
      physician who instructs a patient to self- administer a drug, or
      to have the drug administered by another and/or who provides a
      patient with a prescription for a drug is administering the drug
      to the patient.<br>
      <br>
      [0149] According to some embodiments, the pharmaceutical
      composition is administered by an invasive mode of administration
      such as intramuscularly, intravenously, intra-arterially,
      intraarticulary or parenterally.<br>
      <br>
      [0150] It will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art
      that the therapeutically effective amount of the molecule
      according to the present invention will depend, inter alia upon
      the administration schedule, the unit dose of molecule
      administered, whether the molecule is administered in combination
      with other therapeutic agents, the immune status and health of the
      patient, the therapeutic activity of the molecule administered and
      the judgment of the treating physician. As used herein, a
      "therapeutically effective amount" refers to the amount of a
      molecule required to alleviate one or more symptoms associated
      with a disorder being treated over a period of time.<br>
      <br>
      [0151] Although an appropriate dosage of a molecule of the
      invention varies depending on the administration route, type of
      molecule (polypeptide, polynucleotide, organic molecule etc.) age,
      body weight, sex, or conditions of the patient, it will be
      determined by the physician in the end. Various considerations in
      arriving at an effective amount are described, e.g., in Goodman
      and Gilman's: The Pharmacological Bases of Therapeutics, 8th ed.,
      Pergamon Press, 1990; and Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences,
      17th ed., Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa., 1990.<br>

      10&lt;9&gt;pfu(plaque forming units) of M13 phages that express
      the following peptides: eEF2-binding : RB, LBR1, TB2 (Toxl), Y02,
      GW (Tox2), DRB, PY, BW were added. The plate was incubated lhr at
      25°C. The solution were discarded and the wells were washed 7
      times with 280μ1 washing solution (Tween 20 0.05%).<br>
      <br>
      [0257] Each well was supplemented with 50μ1 of HRP/Anti-M13
      Monoclonal Conjugate (GE Healthcare) diluted 1 :5000. The plate
      was incubated lhr at 25°C. The solutions were discarded and the
      wells were washed 7 times with 280μ1 washing solution (Tween 20
      0.05%). Each well was supplemented with 50μ1 of TMB (T0440 ;
      Sigma). [0258] The plate was photographed using a scanner after
      incubation time of 1.5min and 30min. It can be seen from Fig. 2
      that Toxl (denoted as TB2 in the figures) had the strongest
      effect. Example 4. Toxl and Tox2 activate eEF2<br>
      <br>
      [0259] The effect of Toxl and Tox2 was tested in the in vitro
      transcription/translation system using HeLa Lysate system 1-Step
      Human Coupled IVT Kit-DNA(ThermoFisher Scientific). The following
      peptides were tested: GW (Toxl), DRB RB,TB2 (Tox2), and BW. In
      addition, a non eEF2 -binding control peptide, GR, was also
      tested.<br>
      <br>
      [0260] The IVT Kit components were mixed, and one portion was
      taken out to serve as a negative control. The rest of the mix was
      supplemented with pCFE-GFP DNA. This DNA, when transcribed and
      translated gives a fluorescence protein, GFP. The extent of
      fluorescence gives a measure of the extent of protein synthesis.<br>
      <br>
      [0261] The mix was split into 9ml aliquots. Each aliquot was
      supplemented with 1ml of one concentration of a specific peptide.
      A positive control was supplemented with 1ml of PBS. The reaction
      mixtures were incubated 4hr at 30°C.<br>
      <br>
      [0262] 40ml of PBS were added to each reaction mixtures. The
      mixtures were transferred to a 96 well black ELISA plate, and the
      fluorescence was measured at ex/em 482/512nm.<br>
      <br>
      [0263] It can be seen from the results (see Fig. 3), most of the
      peptides gave higher fluorescence than the positive control (that
      contained no peptide ; orange dot), and more than the non eEF2
      -binding control peptide at concentration of 5μΜ. That means that
      they enhanced protein synthesis, when TB2 and GW provided the
      highest effect. Example 5. Preparation of multi-armed PEG complex
      loaded with 2 targeting peptides and 2 toxins<br>
      <br>
      [0264] A construct of a branched PEG molecule covalently coupled
      with two different cancer-targeting moieties and two different
      toxin moieties was designed and synthesized (the schematic
      representation of the scaffold is shown in Fig. 1). The targeting
      moieties included in this example construct were the cyclic
      peptides E13.3 (consisting of SEQ ID NO: l) and PD-L1-GR
      (consisting of SEQ ID NO:2), and the toxin moieties were the
      cyclic peptides Toxl (consisting of SEQ ID NO:3), and Tox2
      (consisting of SEQ ID NO:4). [0265] The preparation method
      comprised two steps. At the first step a branched PEG containing
      eight arms was produced in which seven arms were coupled with
      targeting/toxin moieties (protected peptides) and one with a
      Lysine residue protected with FMOC (Fmoc-Lys). At the second step
      eight of the peptide/toxin-PEG molecules produced in step 1 were
      coupled to another branched PEG molecule of eight arms to obtain a
      construct of multi-branched PEG coupled with 56 toxin/targeting
      moieties, of which 42 moieties are toxin peptides (21 Toxl and 21
      Tox2), and 14 are targeting peptides (7 copies of EGRF targeting
      peptide E13.3 and 7 copies of PD-L1 targeting peptide PD-L1-GR).<br>

      peptide were dissolved in DMSO.<br>
      <br>
      [0269] All peptides have only one primary amine, except for E13.3,
      which has 3, of which one is protected with dde, and the
      N-terminal is blocked with acetate residue.<br>
      <br>
      [0270] 5.9mg Fmoc-Lys-OH (Novabiochem (Merck) Cat. Num. 852023;
      MW=368.43) was dissolved in 150 μΐ of HC1 0.1 M, followed by
      addition of 650μ1 of DMSO to reach a concentration of 20 mM.<br>
      <br>
      [0271] 33.4mg of 8-arm star PEG-NHS (Mw lOKDa, Creative
      Biotechnologies) were dissolved in 167μ1 of dioxane to reach a
      concentration of 20 mM.<br>
      <br>
      [0272] Each of the targeting peptides solutions were mixed with
      17μ1 of Fmoc-Lys-OH solution and 17μ1 of PEG solution.<br>
      <br>
      [0273] Each of the toxin peptides solutions were mixed with 52μ1
      of Fmoc-Lys-OH solution and 52μ1 of PEG solution. Each mix was
      supplemented with TEA (trimethylamine) to 5%. Each solution was
      incubated for 15.5 hours at room temperature on a Rotamix at 30
      rpm to obtain a clear solution of 8 armed PEG coupled with 7
      molecules of a specific targeting/toxin moiety and one arm
      containing a primary amine(The Fmoc protection is removed in this
      process to give one free primary amine on each PEG molecule).<br>
      <br>
      [0274] The branched PEG-peptide molecules are denoted PEG-E13.3,
      PEG-PD-L1-GR, PEG-Tox 1 and PEG-Tox 2.<br>
      <br>
      [0275] Step 2 - construction of multi-branched PEG construct
      coupled to 56 targeting/toxin moieties. [0276] The branched
      PEG-peptide solutions: PEG-E13.3, PEG-PD-L1-GR, PEG-Toxl and
      PEG-Tox2 were mixed together with 20mM PEG-NHS solution in a
      stoichiometric molar ratio of
      PEG-NHS:PEG-E13.3:PEG-PD-Ll-GR:PEG-Toxl :PEG-Tox2 of 1 :1 :1 :3:3,
      and incubated for 2 hours at room temperature on a Rotamix at 30
      rpm, followed by slow addition of 80% hydrazine to a final
      concentration of 5%. Hydrazine was used to remove the dde
      protecting group from the El 3.3 moiety. The mixture was incubated
      for 2 hours at room temperature on a Rotamix at 30 rpm. The
      resultant construct is a multi-branched PEG coupled with 56
      targeting/toxin moieties: 7 copies of El 3.3 peptide, 7 copies of
      PD-L1-GR peptide, 21 copies of Toxl and 21 copies of Tox 2. At the
      end of the reaction, PBS was added with gentle mixing.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0277] Step 3 - Ultrafiltration</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0278] The samples were ultrafiltrated with two additions of 20ml
      PBS using Vivaspin 20 concentrator (30 K MWCO PES) to a
      concentration of -206 μΜ of loaded multi- armed PEG denoted as
      PEG-E13.3-(PD-Ll-GR)-Toxl-Tox2, and the buffer was substituted to
      PBS.<br>
      <br>
      [0279] In a similar way, additional multi-branched PEGs carrying
      alternative toxins or peptides (such as BIM) were produces.
      Examples of such multi-armed PEG is PEG- E13.3-PD-L1-GR-BIM, in
      which the toxins Tox 1 and Tox 2 were substituted by BIM. Example
      6. Toxicity of a construct comprising E13.3, Toxl and Tox2<br>
      <br>
      [0280] A construct comprising a multi-arm-PEG scaffold bound to
      E13.3 targeting peptide having the sequence SEQ ID NO: 1
      (CHPGDKQEDPNCLQADK) and a toxin selected from BIMBH3 (referred
      also as BIM and having the sequence SEQ ID NO: 5
      MRPEIWIAQELRRIGDEFNA) or a combination of Toxl and Tox2 was
      generated. The scaffolds were prepared as described in Example 5
      and is denoted as PEG-E13.3- Toxl-Tox2 and PEG-13.3-BIM,
      accordingly<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0281] Cells Culture and Seeding:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0282] A431 cells (human squamous carcinoma express about 100,000
      copies of EGFR on each cell) and MCF-7 cells ( breast cancer cell
      expressing about 3,000 copies of EGFR on each cell) were thawed
      and cultivated to achieve exponentially growing cultures. Cells
      were collected, counted and seeded at the density of 7,000
      cells/well and 5,000 cells/well, respectively, in a 96 well tissue
      culture plate.<br>
      <br>
      [0283] The plates were incubated until the next day at the
      following conditions: 37+1 °C, humidified, and 5+0.5% C02/air, to
      enable cells adherence to the wells. [0284] Treatment:<br>
      <br>
      [0285] The cell viability of A549 cell was tested using Alamar
      Blue viability assay. At the next day following the seeding,
      Growth Media was replaced with 200μ1 Assay Media that contained 2%
      FBS and Test Items at different concentrations of the construct
      (1, 3 and 8 μΜ), or Vehicle Control (PBS; concentration-0). Plates
      were incubated at 37+1 °C, humidified 5+0.5% CCVair. After 48
      hours of incubation, images of cells treatments were taken on
      microscope (see Figs. 4-7).<br>
      <br>
      [0286] Several concussions can be made from these experiments.
      First, it can be seen on the figures that the typical cells
      aggregates characterizing A431 and MCF-7 disappeared when a
      construct comprising PEG-E13.3 and any one of the toxin was added
      (Figs. 5-6). Moreover the phenomena was dose dependent. However,
      when the construct lacked El 3.3 peptide (Fig. 7), increasing the
      concentration of the toxin did not increase the ratio of dead
      cells significantly and actually was not different from the
      control. This result clearly indicate that E13.3 targeted the
      construct to the cell.<br>
      <br>
      [0287] Second, the proportion of dead cells increased with
      increasing the concentration of the toxins (for both, BIM and
      combination of Toxl and Tox2), indicating for dose dependent
      effect. Moreover, comparing the images obtained for BIM and a
      combination of Toxl and Tox2, it can be seen that the combination
      was more potent causing to more severe cell death. As expected
      MCF-7 cells, expressing less EGFR were less sensitive than A431
      cells.<br>
      <br>
      [0288] Concluding all said above it is clear that a construct
      comprising a toxin such as Toxl, Tox2 or a combination thereof and
      targeting peptides, wherein at least one of them is E13.3 are
      potent in targeting and treating cancer. Example 7. Cytotoxicity
      of the constructs as tested on A431 cells<br>
      <br>
      [0289] In condition similar to those of Examples 5 and 6,
      PEG-PD-L1-GR-BIM, PEG- E13.3-BIM and PEG-E13.3-PD-L1-GR-BIM
      constructs were prepared and tested for cytotoxicity using A431
      cells and Alamar Blue Blue viability assay varying the
      concentration of the construct from 10 nM to 1 μΜ. After 48 hours
      of incubation, images of cells treatments were taken on
      microscope.<br>
      <br>
      [0290] The results are presented in Fig. 8. It can be seen that
      the construct PEG- PD- Ll-GR-BIM and PEG-E13.3-BIM had limited
      ability of killing A431 cells at 1 μΜ concentration. The
      combination of E13.3 and PD-L1-GR targeting peptides on the other
      hand provided killing or more than 60% of the cells. Actually the
      cytotoxic effect of the construct comprising both targeting
      peptides was higher than the additive effect of the two constructs
      comprising one of two these peptides. This clearly indicates for
      the synergistic cytotoxic effect that the construct comprising two
      targeting peptides and a combination of Toxl and Tox2 has.<br>

      [0300] As can be clearly seen from Fig. 9
      PEG-E13.3-(PD-Ll-GR)-Toxl-Tox2 was effective in killing A549 cell
      both in concentration of 3 and 10 μΜ. Interestingly, PEG-
      E13.3-(PD-Ll-GR)-Toxl-Tox2 at the concentration of 3 μΜ it was
      much more efficient than 10 μΜ PEG-E13.3-(PD-L1-GR)-BIM construct

      results are presented in Figs. 13. The IC50 of all peptides was
      about 0.5-1 μΜ.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 15. Preparation of E13.3 bound to 8-arm PEG</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0317] 9.8 mg of E13.3(fmoc)Lys was dissolved in water to the
      final concentration of 20 mg/ml. 11.3 mg of 8 arm PEG Succinimidyl
      Carboxymethyl Ester, MW 73,000 (JENKEM TECHNOLOGY USA INC) with
      565 μΐ dioxane was heated at 37°C to a complete dissolution. El
      3.3 and PEG solution were mixed in the presence of 50 μΐ TEA and
      incubated overnight at room temperature. To the obtained solution,
      50 μΐ piperidine was added and incubated for 0.5 at room
      temperature. To the solution, 1 ml of ethyl acetate was added to
      obtain a suspension which was than centrifuged and the upper phase
      was removed. These steps of washing with ethyl acetate were
      repeated 4-5 times. Finally, the upper phase was removed
      completely and the remained pellet was dissolved in 200 μΐ PBS.
      The buffer was further exchanged to PBS using Vivaspin 20ml
      Concentrator to eliminate any traces of ethyl acetate.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 16. Stability of E13.3 in mice</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0318] The stability of the fluorescently marked peptide E13.3
      alone or bound to 8- armed PEG was evaluated in vivo by injecting
      the compounds to the tail vein of mice. The blood of the animals
      was analyzed for the presence of the peptide (fluorescence) at
      different time intervals. It can be clearly seen from the result
      presented in Fig. 14 that to.5 of the free peptide is much shorter
      (about several minutes) than that of the peptides bound to PEG
      (t0.5 of about 3.5 hours).<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 17. The effect of E13.3 on the viability of different
        cancer cell lines</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0319] The anti-cancer activity of E13.3 was assessed using
      several cancer cell lines (A549 - human lung carcinoma cell line
      and FaDu - human pharyngeal carcinoma cell line). The cell
      cultures were incubated in the presence or absence of El 3.3 (at
      different concentrations) and tested for viability using
      alamarBlue reagent. The results are presented on Fig. 15. It can
      be seen, that El 3.3 bound to PEG could successfully reduce the
      viability of the cancer cells in all tested concentrations.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 18. Accumulation of fluorescent PEG-E13.3 in cancer
        tumors</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0320] El 3.3 -PEG was labeled with Flourescein and injected IV to
      Xenograft mice bearing subcutaneous NCI-H1650 tumor (lung cancer).
      Following anesthesia, kidney, liver and tumor were collected at
      specific time points and the fluorescence was measured. The
      results are presented in Figs. 16 and 17.<br>
      <br>
      [0321] As it can be seen from Fig. 16, there was a fast increase
      in the fluorescence in kidney and liver with a typical elimination
      curve afterwards. Contrary to that, the fluorescence was
      accumulated in the cancer cells indicating that E13.3 effectively
      binds, enters and accumulated in the cancer cells. Results shown
      on Fig. 17 further support that most of the cancer cells interact
      with E13.3-PEG and internalize the fluorescent peptide. Example
      19: PD-Ll binding proteins<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0322] Screening</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0323] Using the technique described in WO 2007/010525, a series
      of new peptides (cyclopeptides) binding to binding to a human
      PD-Ll were generated and tested. After identification of several
      potential peptides, a few further cycles of optimization were
      performed. One of the peptides, denoted as PD-Ll-GR and having the
      sequence of CysGluGlyLeuProAlaAspTrpAlaAlaAlaCys (SEQ ID NO: 2)
      showed high affinity to the receptor at its binding site. Example
      20. Preparation of PD-Ll-GR peptide bound to multi-armed PEG
      construct<br>
      <br>
      [0324] Multi-armed PEG constructs comprising (i) PD-Ll-GR cyclic
      peptide and BIM- BH3 (denoted as PEG-(PD-Ll-GR)-BIM), (ii) E13.3
      targeting peptide (SEQ ID NO:l) and BIM-BH3 toxin (denoted as
      PEG-E13.3-BIM), and (iii) E13.3, PD-Ll-GR and BIM-BH3 toxin
      (denoted as PEG-E13.3-(PD-L1-GR)-BIM) were prepared as described
      in Example 5.<br>
      <br>
      [0325] The constructs were used as Test Items in cell
      proliferation assay in concentration of ΙμΜ. PBS was used as a
      control. For the assay, A549 cells (human lung carcinoma cell
      line) were thawed and cultivate to achieve exponentially growing.
      The cells were collected, counted and seeded at the density of
      7,000 cells/well in a 96 well tissue culture plate. The plate was
      incubated until the next day at 37+1 °C, humidified, 5+0.5%
      C02/air, to enable cells adherence to the wells. At the next day,
      Growth Media are replaced with Test Items Solutions prepared in
      Assay Medium (2%f FBS). Test Items Solutions are applied carefully
      in volume of 200μ1Λνε11 to achieve the final concentrations of the
      Test Items of ΙμΜ. After 48 hours of incubation, representative
      images of cells treatments were taken on microscope and are
      presented in Fig. 18.<br>
      <br>
      [0326] It can be seen from Fig. 18, the construct comprising
      PEG-E13.3-(PD-L1-GR)- BIM was the only construct to inhibit cell
      proliferation at a concentration of ΙμΜ. This indicates that the
      complex comprising a combination of E13.3 and PD-Ll-GR peptides
      has significantly higher cytotoxicity than the combined
      cytotoxicity of the constructs comprising only one of the
      peptides. [0327] Although the present invention has been described
      herein above by way of preferred embodiments thereof, it can be
      modified, without departing from the spirit and nature of the
      subject invention as defined in the appended claims.<br>

      <b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0002] This invention is directed to a method of identifying a
      polypeptide having an intermolecular interaction with a target of
      interest and functional features thereof.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0003] Phage display has become a powerful method for screening
      populations of peptide or polypeptides, mutated proteins, and
      cDNAs for members that have affinity to target molecules of
      interest. It is possible to generate many different recombinants
      from which one or more clones can be selected with affinity to
      antigens, antibodies, cell surface receptors, protein chaperones,
      DNA, metal ions, etc. Screening libraries are versatile because
      the displayed elements are expressed on the surface of the virus
      as capsid-fusion proteins. The most important consequence of this
      arrangement is that there is a physical linkage between phenotype
      and genotype. There are several other advantages as well: 1) virus
      particles which have been isolated from libraries by affinity
      selection can be regenerated by simple bacterial infection and 2)
      the primary structure of the displayed binding peptide or protein
      can be easily deduced by DNA sequencing of the cloned segment in
      the viral genome.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Synthetic oligonucleotides that are fixed in length, but
      with multiple unspecified codons can be cloned into genes III, VI,
      or VIII of bacteriophage M1 3 where they are expressed on the
      capsid fusion protein. The libraries, often referred to as random
      peptide libraries, can be screened for binding to target molecules
      of interest.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Most vital cellular processes are regulated by the
      transmission of signals wherein such signal transduction is likely
      mediated by protein-protein interactions involving modular domains
      within the signaling proteins.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Methods for isolating partner proteins involved in
      protein-protein interactions have generally focused on finding a
      ligand to a characterized protein. Such approaches have included
      using anti-idiotypic antibodies that mimic the known protein to
      screen cDNA expression libraries for a binding ligand (Jerne,
      1974, Ann. Immunol. (Inst. Pasteur) 125c:373-389; Sudol, 1994,
      Oncogene 9:2145-2152). Skolnick et al. (1991, Cell 65:83-90)
      isolated a binding partner for PI3-kinase by screening a cDNA
      expression library with the &lt;32&gt;P-labeled tyrosine
      phosphorylated carboxyl terminus of the epidermal growth factor
      receptor (EGFR). While current methods provide for the
      identification and isolation of a peptides having an
      intermolecular interaction with a target of interest, functional
      analysis of the screening steps is currently lacking.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>

      in cleavage of said protein or protein fragment, comprising
      segments which are involved in viral attachment to, infection of,
      or a combination thereof of cells, and prevention of entry of a

      <br>
      [0011] In another embodiment, this invention provides a kit for

      <br>
      [0012] In another embodiment, this invention provides a method for

      <b>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0014] FIG. 1 is an illustration of the conversion, in one
      embodiment, of an infective (A) to a non-infective (B) via
      cleavage of the N1 and N2 domains from the CT domain of the phage
      minor coat gene 3 (pIII) protein of the M13 bacteriophage, which
      is attached to the bacteriophage capsid.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] FIG. 2 is an illustration in one embodiment of a
      genetically engineered infective M13 bacteriophage termed SoIP.
      SoIP comprises the pIII domains of wild type bacteriophage, but
      with an insertion of a modified protease site and a peptide
      between the N2 and CT domains of each pIII protein. Cleavage of
      the N1 and N2 domains of pIII occurs in SoIP when a target protein
      (Target) which is fused to a protease (Protease) binds to the
      peptide expressed on the pIII protein (Peptide). The resultant
      proximity of Protease to the modified protease site results in
      proteolysis of N1, N2, the peptide, and the modified protease site
      from the CT domain of pIII and the capsid.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] FIG. 3 is an illustration of a preferred embodiment of a
      SoIP, specifying the identity of the modified protease site. SoIP
      comprises the pIII domains of wild type bacteriophage, but with an
      insertion of a modified ubiquitin sequence (mUb) and one half of a
      leucine zipper peptide (LeuZip2) between the N2 and CT domains of
      each pIII protein. Cleavage of the N1 and N2 domains of pIII
      occurs in SoIP when the second half of a leucine zipper peptide
      (LeuZip1), which is fused to a UBP protease, binds to LeuZip2
      expressed on the pIII protein. The resultant proximity of UBP to
      mUb results in proteolysis of N1, N2, LeuZip2, and mUb from the CT
      domain of pIII and the capsid.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] FIG. 4 is an illustration in one embodiment of the method
      of incubating infective and non-infective SoIP with bacteria. Only
      infective SoIP are able to enter the bacterial cell. After
      incubation, bacterial cells containing infecting SoIP are removed,
      and non-infective SoIP remain in the medium.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] FIGS. 5A-D are an illustration in one embodiment of the
      method of identifying proteins that interact with a protein of
      interest. A recombinant virus library, in which each recombinant
      virus expresses a peptide unique from those expressed by other
      recombinant viruses in the library, is incubated with a fusion
      protein comprising a known target peptide or polypeptide fused to
      a protease via a flexible linker. Library peptides with an
      affinity for the target will be cleaved. The library is then
      incubated with cells. Recombinant viruses with cleaved pIII
      proteins will be unable to infect cells.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] FIGS. 6A-6D are an illustration of an embodiment of the
      present invention in which the invention can distinguish between
      functional and non-functional peptides or polypeptides using the
      SoIP assay. Functional proteins may be further categorized as
      antagonist, agonist, and/or inhibitor. Recombinant viruses that
      comprise a peptide from the peptide library (referred to as
      “Peptide”) that demonstrates binding to a target protein of
      interest are incubated with the target (6A). Next, a fusion
      protein comprising a protease fused to a known target's ligand is
      added to the incubation mixture comprising the recombinant virus
      (6B). The ligand can be a downstream element, in case the target
      is a receptor, or an enzyme, that works on the target. The peptide
      can either facilitate the binding of the target and its ligand, or
      not. In case the peptide facilitates binding of the target and its
      ligand, the protease and the modified protease site are brought
      into close proximity. This will lead to the cleavage of the pIII
      protein, which will render the recombinant virus non-infective
      (6C). If the peptide inhibits the binding of the target and its
      ligand, the pIII protein will not be cleaved and the recombinant
      virus will remain infective (6D).<br>
      <br>
      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0020] This invention provides a recombinant virus and a
      recombinant virus library and its use in identifying interacting
      polypeptides, which may find application in diagnostics and/or
      therapeutics.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Recombinant Virus</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0021] In one embodiment, a recombinant virus of this invention
      comprises: a protein or protein fragment, comprising segments
      which are involved in viral attachment to, infection of or a
      combination thereof of a host cell; a peptide or polypeptide
      involved in an intermolecular interaction; and a modified cleavage
      site that is proximal to said peptide and to said segments of said
      protein, wherein the cleavage site is modified such that a
      compound mediating cleavage has a reduced binding affinity for
      said cleavage site, as compared to a non-modified cleavage site.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] In one embodiment, viruses of the present invention may
      infect mammalian, insect, plant, bacteria cells or a combination
      thereof. In one embodiment, a virus of the present invention may
      be a bacteriophage. In another embodiment, a virus of the present
      invention may be a filamentous bacteriophage. In another
      embodiment, a virus of the present invention may be M13. In
      another embodiment, it may be lambda phage, fd, f1, or T4. In
      another embodiment, a virus of the present invention may be
      Mycobacteria phage. In one embodiment, it might be Mycobacteria
      phage D29, Mycobacteriophage Bethlehem, Mycobacteriophage U2,
      Mycobacterium phage L5, or Mycobacterium phage TM4.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] Bacteriophage (phage) are viruses that have a specific
      affinity for and infect bacteria. Phages consist of a protein coat
      or capsid enclosing the genetic material (DNA or RNA) that is
      injected into a bacterium upon infection. Phages may be lytic or
      temperate. Lytic phages lyse, or break apart, the host cell, while
      temperate phages integrate their DNA into that of the host
      (lysogeny). In the case of lytic phages, all synthesis of host
      DNA, RNA and proteins ceases, and the phage genome is used to
      direct the synthesis of phage nucleic acids and proteins using the
      host's transcriptional and translational apparatus. These phage
      components then self assemble to form new phage particles. The
      synthesis of a phage lysozyme leads to rupture of the bacterial
      cell wall releasing typically 100-200 phage progeny. The temperate
      phages, such as lambda, may also show this lytic cycle when they
      infect a cell, but more frequently they induce lysogeny. Examples
      of bacteriophages that attack Escherichia coli are lambda phage
      and the T even phages, T2, T4 and T6.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] In another embodiment, viruses can include any desired
      virus, as will be recognized by those of skill in the art,
      including but not limited to Adenoviruses, Herpesviruses,
      Poxviruses, Parvoviruses, Reoviruses, Birnaviruses,
      Picornaviruses, Togaviruses, Orthomyxoviruses, Rhabdoviruses,
      Retroviruses, Hepadnaviruses, Enterovirus, Cardiovirus,
      Rhinovirus, Apthovirus, Hepatovirus, etc. In one embodiment,
      viruses are lysogenic, while in another embodiment, viruses are
      temperate.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] In one embodiment, the term “recombinant virus” refers to
      viruses that are engineered to express foreign or modified protein
      or proteins, which are not natively expressed in that virus. At
      least one protein or protein fragment is expressed by the
      recombinant virus.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] In another embodiment, the virus can be modified in any of
      various ways known in the art, such as to introduce temperature
      sensitivity, to introduce a reporter gene, to be rendered
      replication-deficient, or to eliminate other viral genes. Methods
      of such modifications are standard in the art. In one embodiment,
      the virus is modified to express the peptide on the surface of the
      virus, as by engineering the virus genome to encode a fusion
      protein for a coat protein and the peptide. In one embodiment, the
      present invention further provides a recombinant virus comprising
      a selectable marker or label such that the label can be directly
      detected. The selectable marker can be any selectable marker,
      which is known in the art, such as antibiotic resistance protein,
      for example, without being limited, ampicillin. The selectable
      marker can be also used for deletion mutants counter selection,
      when there is a need to select cells that are infected by virus
      that did not lose essential genes.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] In one embodiment, the term “protein or protein fragment”
      refers to a molecule comprised of amino acid residues joined by
      peptide (i.e., amide) bonds and includes peptides, polypeptides,
      and proteins. In another embodiment, “protein or protein fragment”
      refers to a protein or protein fragment comprising segments which
      are involved in viral attachment, infection, or a combination
      thereof. In one embodiment, the term “segment” refers to a
      sequence of amino acids of any length with functional or
      structural homology to proteins known to mediate viral attachment,
      infection, or a combination thereof. In one embodiment, a “tail”
      refers to a protein involved in viral attachment, infection, or a
      combination thereof.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] In one embodiment, a segment of said protein or protein
      fragment mediates attachment. In one embodiment, the term
      “attachment” refers to a physical connection between a virus and a
      host cell. In the process of viral infection, a virus attaches to
      a host cell in order to enter or penetrate it. Many viruses
      comprise a protein expressed on its surface, sometimes referred to
      as an “antireceptor” which binds to a constituent of the cell
      surface of a potential host cell, sometimes referred to as a
      “receptor.” In one embodiment, the proteins or protein segments
      involved in viral attachment comprise the pIII protein. In another
      embodiment, the protein or protein segments comprise the PVIII
      protein. In one embodiment, the proteins or protein segments
      involved in viral attachment comprise the N2 domain of the pIII
      protein (a.k.a. Coat Protein A) of filamentous bacteriophage (M13,
      fd, f1, I2-2, If1, Ike, Pf1), the A protein of Bacteriophage fr,
      GA, or MS2, the Gp38 protein (a.k.a. receptor recognizing protein)
      of Bacteriophage AR1, K3, M1, Ox2, or T2, the J protein of
      Bacteriophage lambda, φx174, α3, or G4, and others, known to one
      skilled in the art. In another embodiment, the proteins or protein
      segments involved in viral attachment comprise hemagglutinin of
      influenza virus, gp120 envelope glycoprotein of HIV or segments
      thereof, and others, known to one skilled in the art.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] In one embodiment, a segment of said protein or protein
      fragment mediates infection. In one embodiment, the term
      “infection”, “entry,” “fusion” and “penetration” refer to fusion
      of a virus with the membrane of a host cell to allow the passage
      of genetic material or a complete virus into the host cell. Some
      viruses comprise a protein or a protein segment that is involved
      in cell entry. In one embodiment, the proteins or protein segments
      involved in infection comprise the pIII protein. In another
      embodiment, the protein or protein segments comprise the PVIII
      protein. In one embodiment, a protein or a protein segment that is
      involved in infection is the N1 domain of the pIII protein of
      filamentous bacteriophage. In another embodiment, a protein or a
      protein segment that is involved in infection is the gp41 of
      HIV-1, while in another embodiment, it's the V3 domain or other
      segments of the gp120 of HIV-1.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] In one embodiment, the protein or protein fragment
      comprising segments involved in viral attachment, infection or a
      combination thereof are structural or functional homologs of those
      mentioned hereinabove. In another embodiment, the segment involved
      in viral attachment, infection or a combination thereof are
      synthetically constructed using methods well known in the art.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] In one embodiment, two protein fragments of a single
      protein mediate mediate attachment and infection. In another
      embodiment, a single protein or protein fragment mediates both
      attachment and infection. In another embodiment, two protein
      fragments of two distinct proteins mediate attachment and
      infection. In another embodiment, two protein fragments of two
      distinct proteins mediate attachment and infection. In another
      embodiment, two distinct proteins mediate attachment and
      infection.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Non-Endogenous Peptides</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0032] In one embodiment, each recombinant virus of the present
      invention comprises a peptide involved in at least one
      intermolecular interaction. In one embodiment, the term
      “polypeptide” or “peptide” refers to a molecule comprised of amino
      acid residues joined by peptide (i.e., amide) bonds and includes
      peptides, polypeptides, and proteins. Hence, in one embodiment,
      the polypeptides of this invention may have single or multiple
      chains of covalently linked amino acids and may further contain
      intrachain or interchain linkages comprised of disulfide bonds. In
      one embodiment, some polypeptides may also form a subunit of a
      multiunit macromolecular complex. In one embodiment, the
      polypeptides can be expected to possess conformational preferences
      and to exhibit a three-dimensional structure. Both the
      conformational preferences and the three-dimensional structure
      will usually be defined by the polypeptide's primary (i.e., amino
      acid) sequence and/or the presence (or absence) of disulfide bonds
      or other covalent or non-covalent intrachain or interchain
      interactions. In another embodiment, the polypeptides do not
      possess conformational preferences or exhibit a three-dimensional
      structure.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] In one embodiment, the terms “peptides”, “polypeptides”,
      “plurality of peptides” or “plurality of polypeptides” can be used
      interchangeably and refer to more than one peptide or polypeptide.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] The polypeptide of the present invention can be of any
      size. As can be expected, the polypeptides can exhibit a wide
      variety of molecular weights, some exceeding 150 to 200
      kilodaltons (kD). Typically, the polypeptides may have a molecular
      weight ranging from about 5,000 to about 100,000 daltons. Still
      others may fall in a narrower range, for example, about 10,000 to
      about 75,000 daltons, or about 20,000 to about 50,000 daltons. In
      an alternative embodiment, the polypeptides of the present
      invention may be 1-250 amino acid residues long. In another
      embodiment, the polypeptides of the present invention may be
      10-200 amino acid residues long. In an alternative embodiment, the
      polypeptides of the present invention may be 50-100 amino acid
      residues long. In an alternative embodiment, the polypeptides of
      the present invention may be 1-250 amino acid residues long. In an
      alternative embodiment, the polypeptides of the present invention
      may be 1-250 amino acid residues long.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] The peptides or polypeptides, or the DNA sequences encoding
      same, may be obtained from a variety of natural or unnatural
      sources, such as a prokaryotic or a eukaryotic cell. In one
      embodiment, the source cell may be wild type, recombinant, or
      mutant. In another embodiment, the plurality of peptides or
      polypeptides may be endogenous to microorganisms, such as
      bacteria, yeast, or fungi, to a virus, to an animal (including
      mammals, invertebrates, reptiles, birds, and insects) or to a
      plant cell.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] In another embodiment, the peptides or polypeptides may be
      obtained from more specific sources, such as the surface coat of a
      virion particle, a particular cell lysate, a tissue extract, or
      they may be restricted to those polypeptides that are expressed on
      the surface of a cell membrane.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] In another embodiment, the peptide or polypeptide is
      derived from a particular cell or tissue type, developmental stage
      or disease condition or stage. In one embodiment, the disease
      condition or stage is cancer, in another embodiment, it's an
      infection, in another embodiment, it's an HIV infection, in
      another embodiment, it's a developmental disorder, while in
      another embodiment, it's a metabolic disorder.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] In one embodiment, the peptide or polypeptide is obtained
      from a peptide or polypeptide library as is described hereinbelow.
      In another embodiment, it's created synthetically and inserted
      into a vector as is well known in the art. In one embodiment, the
      term “vector” is used to refer to a carrier nucleic acid molecule
      into which a nucleic acid sequence can be inserted for
      introduction into a cell where it can be replicated.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] In one embodiment, the peptide or polypeptide is expressed
      on the external surface of the virus. In another embodiment, the
      peptide or polypeptide is not the most terminal peptide on a
      protein or recombinant protein expressed on the external surface
      of the virus. In one embodiment, “terminal” refers to the absolute
      end of a protein or polypeptide. In one embodiment, the peptide or
      polypeptide is not at the 3′ end of a protein or recombinant
      protein expressed on the external surface of the virus, while in
      another embodiment, it is not at 5′ end of a protein or
      recombinant protein. In one embodiment, the peptide or polypeptide
      is not among the last 50 amino acids of a protein or recombinant
      protein. In another embodiment, the peptide or polypeptide is not
      among the last 100 amino acids of a protein or recombinant
      protein. In another embodiment, the peptide or polypeptide is not
      among the last 500 amino acids of a protein or recombinant
      protein.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] In another embodiment, the peptide or polypeptide is
      connected to the proximal segments of the protein or protein
      fragment involved in viral attachment, infection, or a combination
      thereof via a flexible linker. In one embodiment, the linker is G1
      or G2 of the protein pIII of M13. In another embodiment, the
      flexible linker is a (Gly-Gly-Gly-Ser-)n (SEQ ID No. 1) synthetic
      linker. In another embodiment, any other flexible linker could be
      used.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] In another embodiment, the peptides or polypeptides are
      agonists. In another embodiment, the peptides or polypeptides are
      antagonists. In another embodiment, the peptides or polypeptides
      are antigens. In another embodiment, the peptides or polypeptides
      are enzymes. In another embodiment, the peptides or polypeptides
      are activators of enzymes or other substrates. In another
      embodiment, the peptides or polypeptides are inhibitors of enzymes
      or other substrates. In another embodiment, the peptides or
      polypeptides are hormones. In another embodiment, the peptides or
      polypeptides are regulatory proteins. Regulatory proteins command
      the numerous interactions that govern the expression and
      replication of genes, the performance of enzymes, the interplay
      between cells and their environment, and many other
      manifestations. In another embodiment, the peptides or
      polypeptides are cytoskeletal proteins. Cytoskeletal proteins form
      a flexible framework for the cell, provide attachment points for
      organelles and formed bodies, and make communication between parts
      of the cell possible. In another embodiment, the peptides or
      polypeptides are toxins. In another embodiment, the peptides or
      polypeptides are functional fragments of agonists, antagonists,
      antigens, enzymes, enzyme activators, enzyme inhibitors, enzyme
      substrates, hormones, regulatory proteins, cytoskeletal proteins,
      or toxins. “Functional fragments” are meant to indicate a portion
      of the peptide or polypeptide which is capable of performing one
      or more of the functions of the peptide or polypeptide, even in
      the absence of the remainder of the peptide or polypeptide. In one
      embodiment, the functional fragment is sufficient to mediate an
      intermolecular interaction with a target of interest.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] In an alternative embodiment, the peptide binds DNA or RNA
      or a fragment thereof. In one embodiment, the DNA or RNA binding
      peptide may be any of the many known in the art including, but not
      limited to: Zinc finger proteins such as Beta-beta-alpha zinc
      finger proteins, Nuclear receptor proteins, Loop-sheet-helix type

      factor family, and ETS domain family bacteriophage; and the
      Leucine zipper proteins such as Basic zipper proteins and
      Zipper-type proteins (helix-loop-helix). In another embodiment,

      protein, DNA polymerase T7, Dnase I proteins, DNA polymerase beta
      proteins, Uraci-DNA glycosylase, Methyladenine-DNA glycosylase,
      Homing endonuclease, and Topoisomerase I or viral proteins such as
      HIV reverse transcriptase.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] In another embodiment, the peptide or polypeptide is a
      transcriptional or translational activator or a fragment thereof.
      In another embodiment, the peptide or polypeptide is a
      transcriptional or translational repressor or a fragment thereof.
      In another embodiment, the peptide or polypeptide is a receptor or
      a fragment thereof. In another embodiment, the peptide or
      polypeptide is an organic molecule, inorganic compound, or

      <br>
      [0044] In one embodiment, the peptide or polypeptide may represent
      a cognate peptide of any of the peptides or polypeptides described
      hereinabove. A “cognate” peptide is any peptide that interacts
      and/or binds to another molecule.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] The peptide or polypeptide identified by this invention can
      be in another embodiment, a potential drug candidate or a “lead”
      compound.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] Compounds that pass an initial in vitro screening test,
      such as the methods of the present invention, are known as “lead”
      compounds. These lead compounds are then put through further
      testing, including, eventually, in vivo testing in animals and
      humans, from which the promise shown by the lead compounds in the
      original in vitro tests is either, confirmed or refuted. See

      <b>Intermolecular Interaction</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0047] In one embodiment, the term “intermolecular interaction”
      refers to an expressed peptide or polypeptide of a virus of the
      present invention which has the capacity to bind to a target of
      interest. In one embodiment, the interaction is of high affinity,
      while in another embodiment, it is of low affinity. In one
      embodiment, the interaction is mediated by a covalent bond, an
      ionic bond, a hydrogen bond, Van der Waal's force (a.k.a. weak
      London dispersion forces), dipole-dipole forces, metallic bonding
      or any attractive force which provides a physical proximity of
      between, in one embodiment, 1-5, in another embodiment, 1-20
      angstroms.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] In another embodiment, the peptide may perform a particular
      function with a target of interest. In one embodiment, the
      intermolecular interaction may give rise to a biological,
      chemical, or physiological consequence. In one embodiment, the
      consequence may be reversible, while in another embodiment, it may
      be irreversible. In one embodiment, the intermolecular interaction
      induces a conformational change, a transformation into a different
      chemical state of the functional domain or of molecules acted upon
      by the functional domain, the transduction of an intracellular or
      intercellular signal, the regulation of gene or protein
      expression, the regulation of cell growth or death, the activation
      or inhibition of an immune response, or any combination thereof.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] In one embodiment, the term “intermolecular interaction”
      refers to an affinity between a peptide and a target of interest,
      i.e. the tendency of a peptide to attach to a specific protein
      target. The affinity binding is a measure of the intrinsic binding
      strength of the ligand binding reaction. The intrinsic
      attractiveness of the binder for the ligand is typically expressed
      as the equilibrium association constant (Ka) of the reaction. The
      equilibrium constant Ka=[Ligand-Binder]/[Ligand][Binder], where [
      ] represents the molar concentration of the material at
      equilibrium. The Ka describing the affinity between the peptide
      and the target of interest can be 10&lt;−4&gt;, 10&lt;−5&gt;,
      10&lt;−6&gt;, 10&lt;−7&gt;, 10&lt;−8&gt;, 10&lt;−9&gt;,
      10&lt;−10&gt;, 10&lt;−11&gt;, 10&lt;−12&gt;, 10&lt;−13&gt;,
      10&lt;−14&gt;, 10&lt;−15 &gt;M or lower.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] In one embodiment, the intermolecular interaction may be
      between a receptor and a ligand, a receptor and a downstream
      signal transduction molecule, a receptor and a hormone, a DNA
      binding protein and a DNA oligonucleotide, an RNA binding protein
      and an RNA oligonucleotide, an enzyme and a substrate, a toxin and
      a receptor, a protease and a cleavage site oligonucleotide, an
      antigen and an antibody, two cell adhesion molecules, or two
      cytoskeletal proteins. In another embodiment, the intermolecular
      interaction may refer to an association of any of the above
      proteins with a protein that enhances binding or activity of the
      protein or with a protein that inhibits bind binding or activity
      of the protein. In another embodiment, the intermolecular
      interaction may involve proteins involved in the regulation of
      cellular events such as signal transduction, the cell cycle,
      protein trafficking, targeted proteolysis, cytoskeletal
      organization and gene expression.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] In one embodiment, the environmental conditions such as
      salt concentration, pH, hydrophobicity, temperature and pressure
      may affect the nature of an intermolecular interaction, and those
      factors can be adjusted to the interaction of interest by a person
      skilled in the art.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Modified Cleavage Site</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0052] In one embodiment, the viruses of the present invention
      further comprise modified cleavage sites. In one embodiment, the
      term “modified cleavage site” refers to a cleavage site that has a
      reduced binding affinity to a compound mediating its cleavage. In
      one embodiment, a reduced binding affinity is a relative
      determination where binding affinity of the modified cleavage site
      is lower than that of the natural cleavage site. In one
      embodiment, the capacity of the modified cleavage site to be
      cleaved is similar to that of the natural cleavage site. Cleavage
      may be mediated by proteases or other compounds as will be
      described hereinbelow.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] In one embodiment, the term “reduced binding affinity,”
      “significantly reduced binding affinity” or “reduced affinity”,
      means that the binding affinity of the compound mediating cleavage
      to the cleavage site is as low as possible using the methods
      existing in the art, such as ELISA, Gel Shift, Plasmon Resonance
      (BioCore) etc. In one embodiment, the reduced binding affinity is
      reflected by changes in off-rate, on-rate, free energy,
      interatomic distances, binding entropy or binding enthalpy.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] In one embodiment, the modified cleavage site of the
      present invention is proximal to the peptide and protein segment
      portions of the invention. “Proximal” refers, in one embodiment,
      to a distance of between 1 and 1000 nucleotides between the
      modified cleavage site and a peptide or between the modified
      cleavage site and a protein involved in attachment or infection.
      In one embodiment, the modified cleavage site and a peptide are
      inserted in any order between the domain of a protein involved in
      attachment or infection that anchors the protein to the phage coat
      and the domain of said protein that mediates attachment. In
      another embodiment, the modified cleavage site and a peptide are
      inserted in any order between a domain of a protein that mediates
      attachment and a domain that mediates infection.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] In one embodiment, the present invention also provides an
      oligonucleotide vector of a recombinant virus of the present
      invention as described hereinabove. In another embodiment, the
      present invention provides the use of an oligonucleotide vector of
      the present invention to prepare a recombinant virus.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] In one embodiment, a recombinant virus is created by
      constructing a recombinant vector using standard recombinant
      techniques (see, for example, Maniatis, et al., Molecular Cloning,
      A laboratory Manual (Cold Spring Harbor, 1990) and Ausubel, et
      al., 1994, Current Protocols In Molecular Biology (John Wiley
      &amp; Sons, 1996), both incorporated herein by reference) as is
      well know by one of skill in the art. In one embodiment, cells may
      be transfected with the vector, allowed to multiply, and DNA
      isolated therefrom. In another embodiment, viruses may be
      transduced with the vector.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] In one embodiment, a recombinant virus of the present
      invention may be used in a method to identify a peptide or
      polypeptide that has an intermolecular interaction with a target
      of interest as described hereinbelow. In another embodiment, the
      recombinant virus may be used as part of a kit for identifying a
      peptide or polypeptide that has an intermolecular interaction with
      a target of interest, as described hereinbelow. In another
      embodiment, the recombinant virus may be used in a method to
      identify an agonistic feature, an antagonistic feature of a
      peptide or polypeptide that has an intermolecular interaction with
      a receptor of interest, as described hereinbelow. In another
      embodiment, the recombinant virus may be used in a method to
      identify a peptide or polypeptide that inhibits an enzyme of
      interest, as described hereinbelow. In another embodiment, the
      recombinant virus may be used in a method to identify a peptide or
      polypeptide that has a functional feature with a receptor of
      interest, as described hereinbelow.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Recombinant Virus Library</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0058] In one embodiment, a recombinant virus library of the
      present invention comprises a plurality of viruses as described
      hereinabove. In one embodiment, each virus of the virus library
      comprises a peptide that differs by at least one amino acid from a
      peptide expressed by another virus of the virus library. In one
      embodiment, the viruses of the present invention comprise peptides
      involved in an intermolecular interaction. The peptides can be in
      one embodiment, conveniently selected from any peptide library. In
      one embodiment, they are selected from random peptide libraries,
      in another embodiment, combinatorial peptide libraries, while in
      another embodiment, simulated molecular evolution peptide
      libraries.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] In one embodiment, a random peptide library may generate a
      collection of peptides in which the probability of finding a
      particular amino acid at a given position of the peptide is the
      same for all amino acids. In another embodiment, a bias is
      introduced into the library. For example, a bias that a lysine
      occurs every fifth amino acid or that positions 4, 8, and 9 of a
      decapeptide library be fixed to include only arginine may be
      specified. Clearly, many types of biases can be contemplated, and
      this invention is not restricted to any particular bias.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] In another embodiment, the peptide or polypeptide library
      is created as is well known in the art. For example, in one
      embodiment, a sample of genomic DNA is mechanically sheared or
      partly digested by restriction enzymes to form large fragments. In
      one embodiment, this population of overlapping DNA fragments may
      then be separated by gel electrophoresis to isolate a set of a
      particular length (15 kb for example). In one embodiment,
      synthetic linkers may be attached to the ends of these fragments,
      in one embodiment, cohesive ends may be formed, while in another
      embodiment, blunt ends may be formed.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] In one embodiment, the fragments are then inserted into a
      vector. In one embodiment, the recombinant vector represents the
      virus of this invention. In one embodiment, the vector is a
      plasmid, a bacmid, a phagemid, a cosmid, a phage, a virus or an
      artificial chromosome. In one embodiment, the vector is derived
      from a bacteriophage, which infects E. coli. In one embodiment,
      the vector is derived from a lambda phage, M13, fd, fl, or T4.
      Cells may be transfected with the vector, and DNA isolated
      therefrom. In one embodiment, cells are propagated so the library
      can be used repeatedly.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] As described above, the virus library may utilize, in one
      embodiment, a recombinant plasmids or cosmids. In one embodiment,
      the term “plasmid” is meant to refer to an autonomously
      replicating extrachromosomal DNA molecule or other genetic
      particle, often, but not always, comprised of circular
      double-stranded DNA. Plasmids may become incorporated into the
      genome of the host or may remain independent. In one embodiment,
      the term “cosmid” is meant to refer to a hybrid plasmid that
      contains cos sites at each end. Cos sites are recognized during
      head filling of lambda phages. Cosmids are useful for cloning
      large segments of foreign DNA (up to 50 kb).<br>
      <br>
      [0063] In another embodiment, the library comprises a plurality of
      polypeptides from a polypeptide expression library. The
      polypeptide expression library may be obtained, in one embodiment,
      from cDNA, fragmented genomic DNA, etc. In one embodiment, the
      library is a cDNA library comprising total poly A+RNA of a given
      organism. In one embodiment, the polypeptide is labeled using a
      label as described hereinbelow.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] In one embodiment, the recombinant virus library may be
      used in a method to identify a peptide or polypeptide that has an
      intermolecular interaction with a target of interest as described
      hereinbelow. In another embodiment, the library may be used as
      part of a kit for identifying a peptide or polypeptide that has an
      intermolecular interaction with a target of interest, as described
      hereinbelow. In another embodiment, the library may be used in a
      method to identify an agonistic feature, an antagonistic feature
      of a peptide or polypeptide that has an intermolecular interaction
      with a receptor of interest, as described hereinbelow. In another
      embodiment, the library may be used in a method to identify a
      peptide or polypeptide that inhibits an enzyme of interest, as
      described hereinbelow.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Host Cells</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0065] In one embodiment, the invention comprises a cell
      comprising a recombinant virus of the present invention as
      described hereinabove. In another embodiment, the invention
      comprises a plurality of cells comprising a recombinant virus
      library of the present invention as described hereinabove. “A
      plurality of cells” is meant to indicate more than one cell. Cell
      types may include but are not limited to mammalian, insect, plant,
      or bacterial cells.<br>
      <br>
      [0066] In one embodiment, the terms “cell,” “cell line,” and “cell
      culture” may be used interchangeably. In one embodiment, all of
      these terms also include their progeny, which is any and all
      subsequent generations. It is understood that all progeny may not
      be identical due to deliberate or inadvertent mutations. In one
      embodiment, host cells will have been engineered to express a
      screenable or selectable marker which is activated by the
      transcription factor that is part of a fusion protein.<br>
      <br>
      [0067] In the context of expressing a heterologous nucleic acid
      sequence, “host cell” refers to a prokaryotic or eukaryotic cell
      that is capable of replicating a vector and/or expressing a
      heterologous gene encoded by a vector. When host cells are
      “transfected”, “transformed”, or “transduced” with nucleic acid
      molecules, they are referred to as “engineered” or “recombinant”
      cells or host cells, e.g., a cell into which an non-endogenous
      nucleic acid sequence, such as, for example, a vector, has been
      introduced. Therefore, recombinant cells are distinguishable from
      naturally-occurring cells which do not contain a recombinantly
      introduced nucleic acid. In one embodiment, “non-endogenous” refer
      to a molecule that it is foreign to the cell into which it is
      being introduced. In one embodiment, the non-endogenous molecule
      is DNA. In another embodiment, non-endogenous refers to a nucleic
      acid sequence that is homologous to a sequence in the cell but is
      in a position within the host cell nucleic acid in which the
      sequence is ordinarily not found.<br>
      <br>
      [0068] Numerous cell lines and cultures are available for use as a
      host cell, and they can be obtained through the American Type
      Culture Collection (ATCC), which is an organization that serves as
      an archive for living cultures and genetic materials
      (www.atcc.org). An appropriate host can be determined by one of
      skill in the art based on the vector backbone and the desired
      result. A plasmid or cosmid, for example, can be introduced into a
      prokaryote host cell for replication of many vectors. Cell types
      available for vector replication and/or expression include, but
      are not limited to, bacteria, such as E. coli (e.g., E. coli
      strain RR1, E. coli LE392, E. coli B, E. coli X 1776 (ATCC No.
      31537) as well as E. coli W3110 (F-, lambda-, prototrophic, ATCC
      No. 273325), DHSα, JM109, and KC8, bacilli such as Bacillus
      subtilis, and other enterobacteriaceae such as Salmonella
      typhimurium, Serratia marcescens, various Pseudomonas species, as
      well as a number of commercially available bacterial hosts such as
      SURER Competent Cells and SOLOPACK™ Gold Cells (STRATAGENE, La
      Jolla). In certain embodiments, bacterial cells such as E. coli
      LE392 are particularly contemplated as host cells for phage
      viruses. In one embodiment, E. Coli may be used as a host cell.
      Useful strain of E. Coli may be determined using Genbank
      (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Genbank/index.html) by one skilled in
      the art.<br>
      <br>
      [0069] Examples of eukaryotic host cells for replication and/or
      expression of a vector include, but are not limited to, HeLa,
      NIH3T3, Jurkat, 293, COS, CHO, Saos, and PC 12. Many host cells
      from various cell types and organisms are available and would be
      known to one of skill in the art. Similarly, a viral vector may be
      used in conjunction with either a eukaryotic or prokaryotic host
      cell, particularly one that is permissive for replication or
      expression of the vector.<br>
      <br>
      [0070] In another embodiment, the present invention also provides
      a plurality of oligonucleotide vectors of the recombinant virus
      library of the present invention as described hereinabove. In
      another embodiment, the present invention provides the use of
      oligonucleotide vectors of the present invention to prepare a
      recombinant virus library.<br>
      <br>
      [0071] In one embodiment, a recombinant virus library of the
      present invention may be used in a method to identify a peptide or
      polypeptide that has an intermolecular interaction with a target
      of interest as described hereinbelow. In another embodiment, the
      recombinant virus library may be used as part of a kit for
      identifying a peptide or polypeptide that has an intermolecular
      interaction with a target of interest, as described hereinbelow.
      In another embodiment, the recombinant virus library may be used
      in a method to identify an agonistic feature, an antagonistic
      feature of a peptide or polypeptide that has an intermolecular
      interaction with a receptor of interest, as described hereinbelow.
      In another embodiment, the recombinant virus library may be used
      in a method to identify a peptide or polypeptide that inhibits an
      enzyme of interest, as described hereinbelow. In another
      embodiment, the recombinant virus library may be used in a method
      to identify a peptide or polypeptide that has a functional feature
      with a receptor of interest, as described hereinbelow.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Target of Interest Complex</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0072] In another embodiment, the invention provides a
      protein-protein or protein-non-protein complex (referred to herein
      as “Target of interest (TOI) complex”) comprising a protease or
      functional domain thereof, a target of interest involved in an
      intermolecular interaction, and a flexible linker that attaches
      the protease and target of interest.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Protease</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0073] In one embodiment, the cleavage site is modified such that
      a compound mediating cleavage has a reduced binding affinity for
      said site, as compared to a non-modified cleavage site. In one
      embodiment, a compound that cleaves DNA is a protease or other
      enzyme. “Protease” refers to the enzymes included under E.C.3.4.
      (Cf. Kirk-Othmer, Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, 3rd
      edition, volume 9, pages 173-223, J. Wiley 1980; E. Pfleiderer and
      R. Reiner in H. J. Rehm &amp; G. Reed, Biotechnology, volume 6b,
      pages 729-742, VCH 1988; K. Aunstrup in Industrial Aspects of
      Biochemistry, B. Spencer, editor, volume 30(I), pages 23-46, North
      Holland 1974). Proteases are well characterized enzymes that
      cleave other proteins at a particular site. One family, the
      Ser/Thr proteases, cleave at serine and threonine residues. Other
      proteases include cysteine or thiol proteases, aspartic proteases,
      metalloproteinases, aminopeptidases, di &amp; tripeptidases,
      carboxypeptidases, and peptidyl peptidases. The choice of these is
      left to the skilled artisan and certainly need not be limited to
      the molecules described herein. It is well known that enzymes have
      catalytic domains and these can be used in place of full length
      proteases. Such are encompassed by the invention as well. One
      preferred embodiment is the ubiquitin binding protein-1 protease,
      or an active portion thereof. Other specific cleavage sites for
      proteases may also be used, as will be clear to the skilled
      artisan.<br>
      <br>
      [0074] The proteases of the invention may be, for example,
      specific ubiquitin protease UBP1, aspartyl protease, herpes
      protease, herpes simplex 1 protease, retroviral protease, cysteine
      protease, matrix metalloproteinase, interstitial collagenase
      (MMP-1), gelatinase A (MMP-2) and gelatinase B (MMP-9); serine
      proteases such as plasminogen activator (PA) and the like.
      However, the methods of the present invention are not limited to
      these particular proteases. Endogenous proteolytic enzymes provide
      a variety of useful functions, including the degradation of
      invading organisms, antigen-antibody complexes, and certain tissue
      proteins that are no longer necessary. The serine proteases
      comprise a large family of enzymes that use an activated serine
      residue in the substrate-binding site to catalytically hydrolyze
      peptide bonds the aspartate-specific cysteine proteases (ASCPs).<br>
      <br>
      [0075] In one embodiment, any member of a particular family of
      proteases may be used in place of the protease specifically
      described. Further, any member of a particular family of proteases
      may be used on a particular modified cleavage site.<br>
      <br>
      [0076] In one embodiment, there is provided a recombinant virus
      library in which at least one virus comprises a peptide and a
      modified cleavage site located proximally to a protein or protein
      fragment, comprising segments which are involved in viral
      attachment, infection, or a combination thereof and a protein or
      protein fragment, comprising segments that serve as an anchor. In
      another embodiment, there is provided a recombinant virus library
      in which at least one virus comprises a peptide and a modified
      cleavage site located between a protein or protein fragment,
      comprising segments which are involved in viral attachment,
      infection, or a combination thereof and a protein or protein
      fragment, comprising segments that serve as an anchor. An
      “anchoring protein or fragment” refers to a protein or fragment
      that connects another protein or fragment to a larger body such as
      a cell wall or cell membrane.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Linkers</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0077] In one embodiment, all components of the TOI complex are
      separated by long flexible linkers or spacers to enable a good
      degree of freedom that would allow the components of the system to
      interact with each other. In one embodiment, the linkers allow
      structural folding, while in another embodiment, they allow
      hydrogen bonding.<br>
      <br>
      [0078] The linkers can be, without limitation, leucine zipper, SH2
      domains, PDZ domains, antibody domains, and the like. Any other
      flexible linker could be used as well. In one embodiment, the
      flexible linker is at least 3 amino acids in length. In another
      embodiment the flexible linker is at least 5 amino acids in
      length. In another embodiment the flexible linker is at least 7
      amino acids in length. In another embodiment the flexible linker
      is at least 9 amino acids in length. In another embodiment the
      flexible linker is at least 13 amino acids in length. In another
      embodiment the flexible linker is at least 15 amino acids in
      length. In another embodiment the flexible linker is at least 18
      amino acids in length. In another embodiment the flexible linker
      is between 1 and 20 amino acids in length. In another embodiment
      the flexible linker is between 3 and 15 amino acids in length. In
      another embodiment the flexible linker is between 3 and 10 amino
      acids in length. In another embodiment the flexible linker is
      between 5 and 10 amino acids in length. In another embodiment the
      flexible linker is between 10 and 15 amino acids in length. In
      another embodiment the flexible linker is between 15 and 20 amino
      acids in length. In another embodiment, the target of interest is
      bound directly to a protease without a linker.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Target of Interest</b><b><br>

      [0079] In one embodiment, the TOI complex of the present invention
      comprises a target of interest. The target of interest is in one
      embodiment, a receptor. In one embodiment, the term “receptor”
      refers to receptors that bind peptide messengers with high
      affinity and regulate intracellular signals which influence the
      behavior of cells. In another embodiment, the target of interest
      is an agonist. In another embodiment, the target of interest is an
      antagonist. In another embodiment, the target of interest is an

      polymer, small organic molecule, DNA, RNA, oligonucleotide,
      transcriptional activator or repressor, translational activator or

      <br>
      [0080] In another embodiment, the target of interest is a carrier.
      In another embodiment, the target of interest is an information
      protein. Information proteins are proteins involved in DNA
      replication, repair, recombination and transcription. In another

      Structural proteins are fibrous proteins, including keratins,
      actin, myosin, and collagens involved building components inside
      the cell and around it. In another embodiment, the target of
      interest is a regulatory protein. Regulatory proteins command the
      numerous interactions that govern the expression and replication
      of genes, the performance of enzymes, the interplay between cells
      and their environment, and many other manifestations. In another
      embodiment, the target of interest is a DNA or RNA binding
      peptide.<br>
      <br>
      [0081] In one embodiment, the target materials may be organic
      macromolecules, such as polypeptides, lipids, polynucleic acids,
      and polysaccharides, but are not so limited. Almost any molecule
      that is stable in aqueous solvent may be used as a target. The
      following list of possible targets is given as illustration and
      not as limitation. The categories are not strictly mutually
      exclusive. The omission of any category is not to be construed to
      imply that said category is unsuitable as a target. Merck Index

      catalyze a reaction. In another embodiment, said target of
      interest has one or more intermolecular interactions with an
      agonist, antagonist, antigen, enzyme activator, enzyme inhibitor,
      hormone, regulatory protein, toxin, or a functional fragment
      thereof.<br>
      <br>
      [0084] In one embodiment, the target of interest is a peptide,
      which has approximately 6 to 60 amino acid residues. In another
      embodiment, a peptide target of interest has approximately 20-100
      amino acids, or in another embodiment 20-50 amino acids. In the
      case of a bile acid receptor, for example, the target of interest
      may be a bile acid, such as cholic acid or cholesterol, and may
      have a molecular weight of about 300 to about 600 kDa. If the
      functional domain relates to transcriptional control, the target
      of interest may be a portion of a transcriptional factor, which
      may bind to a region of a gene of interest or to an RNA
      polymerase. The target of interest may even be a nucleoside
      analog, such as cordycepin or the triphosphate thereof, capable of
      inhibiting RNA biosynthesis. The target of interest may also be
      the carbohydrate portion of a glycoprotein, which may have a
      selective affinity for the asialoglycoprotein receptor, or the
      repeating glucan unit that exhibits a selective affinity for
      cellulose binding domain or the active site of heparinase.<br>
      <br>
      [0085] In one embodiment, the target of interest may refer to a
      functional domain of a target of interest. In another embodiment,
      the functional domain may include a ligand binding domain, an
      activation domain, or any other domain of a target of interest.<br>
      <br>
      [0086] In one embodiment, the target of interest is labeled. In
      another embodiment, the TOT complex additionally comprises a tag
      that allows affinity purification. In another embodiment, the tag
      is a His-Tag.<br>
      <br>
      [0087] As described hereinabove, vectors include plasmids,
      cosmids, viruses (bacteriophage, mammalian viruses, and plant
      viruses), and artificial chromosomes (e.g., YACs). One of skill in
      the art would be well equipped to construct a vector through
      standard recombinant techniques (see, for example, Maniatis, et
      al., Molecular Cloning, A laboratory Manual (Cold Spring Harbor,
      1990) and Ausubel, et al., 1994, Current Protocols In Molecular
      Biology (John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1996), both incorporated herein by
      reference).<br>
      <br>
      [0088] The term “expression vector” refers to any type of genetic
      construct comprising a nucleic acid coding for a RNA capable of
      being transcribed. In some cases, RNA molecules are then
      translated into a protein, polypeptide, or peptide. In other
      cases, these sequences are not translated, for example, in the
      production of antisense molecules or ribozymes. Expression vectors
      can contain a variety of “control sequences” which refer to
      nucleic acid sequences necessary for the transcription and
      possibly translation of an operably linked coding sequence in a
      particular host cell. In addition to control sequences that govern
      transcription and translation, vectors and expression vectors may
      contain nucleotide sequences that serve other functions as well
      and are described infra.<br>
      <br>
      [0089] In one embodiment, the TOI complex of the present invention
      is produced by methods known in the art. In one embodiment, the
      TOI complex is produced by in vitro translation. In certain
      embodiments, a plasmid vector is contemplated for use in cloning
      and gene transfer. In general, plasmid vectors containing replicon
      and control sequences which are derived from species compatible
      with the host cell are used in connection with these hosts. The
      vector ordinarily carries a replication site, as well as marking
      sequences which are capable of providing phenotypic selection in
      transformed cells. In a non-limiting example, E. coli is often
      transformed using derivatives of pBR322, a plasmid derived from an
      E. coli species. pBR322 contains genes for ampicillin and
      tetracycline resistance and thus provides an easy means for
      identifying transformed cells. The pBR plasmid, or other microbial
      plasmid or phage must also contain, or be modified to contain, for
      example, promoters which can be used by the microbial organism for
      expression of its own proteins.<br>
      <br>
      [0090] In addition, phage vectors containing replicon and control
      sequences that are compatible with the host microorganism can be
      used as transforming vectors in connection with these hosts. For
      example, the phage lambda GEM™-11 may be utilized in making a
      recombinant phage vector which can be used to transform host
      cells, such as, for example, E. coli LE392.<br>
      <br>
      [0091] Bacterial host cells, for example, E. coli, comprising the
      expression vector, are grown in any of a number of suitable media,
      for example, LB. The expression of the recombinant protein in
      certain vectors may be induced, as would be understood by those of
      skill in the art, by contacting a host cell with an agent specific
      for certain promoters, e.g., by adding IPTG to the media or by
      switching incubation to a higher temperature. After culturing the
      bacteria for a further period, generally between 2 and 24 h, the
      cells are collected by centrifugation and washed to remove
      residual media.<br>
      <br>
      [0092] In another embodiment, prokaryotic vectors can be used to
      transform eukaryotic host cells. However, it may be desirable to
      select vectors that have been modified for the specific purpose of
      expressing proteins in eukaryotic host cells. Expression systems
      hare been designed for regulated and/or high level expression in
      such cells. For example, the insect cell/baculovirus system can
      produce a high level of protein expression of a heterologous
      nucleic acid segment, such as described in U.S. Pat. Nos.
      5,871,986 and 4,879,236, both herein incorporated by reference,
      and which can be bought, for example, under the name MAXBAC® 2.0
      from INVITROGEN® and BACPACK™ BACULOVIRUS EXPRESSION SYSTEM from
      CLONTECH®.<br>
      <br>
      [0093] Other examples of expression systems include STRATAGENE®'S
      COMPLETE CONTROL™ Inducible Mammalian Expression System, which
      involves a synthetic ecdysone-inducible receptor, or its pET
      Expression System, an E. coli expression system. Another example
      of an inducible expression system is available from INVITROGEN®,
      which carries the T-REX™ (tetracycline-regulated expression)
      System, an inducible mammalian expression system that uses the
      full-length CMV promoter. INVITROGEN® also provides a yeast
      expression system called the Pichia methanolica Expression System,
      which is designed for high-level production of recombinant
      proteins in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia methanolica. One of
      skill in the art would know how to express a vector, such as an
      expression construct, to produce a nucleic acid sequence or its
      cognate polypeptide, protein, or peptide.<br>
      <br>
      [0094] The construct may contain additional 5′ and/or 3′ elements,
      such as promoters, enhancers, poly A sequences, and so forth. The
      elements may be derived from the host cell, i.e., homologous to
      the host, or they may be derived from distinct source, i.e.,
      heterologous. It is to be understood that various elements of the
      vector may be manipulated such as, for example, promoters,
      enhancers, high copy or low copy, etc as will be understood by one
      skilled in the art. Any manipulation of the vector is considered
      to be part of the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0095] Vectors can include a multiple cloning site (MCS), donor
      and/or acceptor splicing sites, termination signals,
      polyadenylation sites, etc., as are well known to those of skill
      in the art of recombinant technology.<br>
      <br>
      [0096] In order to propagate a vector in a host cell, it may
      contain one or more origins of replication (often termed “ori”)
      sites′, which are specific nucleotide sequences at which
      replication is initiated. Alternatively, an autonomously
      replicating sequence (ARS) can be employed if the host cell is
      yeast.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Transformation Methodology</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0097] Suitable methods for nucleic acid delivery for use with the
      current invention are believed to include virtually any method by
      which a nucleic acid molecule (e.g., DNA) can be introduced into a
      cell as described herein or as would be known to one of ordinary
      skill in the art. Such methods include, but are not limited to,
      direct delivery of DNA such as by ex vivo transfection, including
      microinjection; by electroporation; by calcium phosphate
      precipitation; by using DEAE-dextran followed by polyethylene
      glycol; by direct sonic loading; by liposome mediated transfection
      and receptor-mediated transfection; by PEG-mediated transformation
      of protoplasts; by desiccation/inhibition-mediated DNA uptake, and
      any combination of such methods, as are well known to those
      skilled in the art.<br>
      <br>
      [0098] In one embodiment, TOI complexes comprising non-protein
      components, once created by any method known in the art, are
      tested for binding specificity using any of the methods known in
      the art including but not limited to electrophoretic mobility
      shift assay (EMSA, Gel Shift Assay, or Band Shift Assay),
      footprinting, and methylation interference with a known ligand of
      the target of interest as a probe. In another embodiment, TOI
      complexes comprising protein components, once created by any
      method known in the art, are tested for binding specificity using
      any of the methods known in the art including but not limited to
      co-immunoprecipitation, yeast two-hybrid, density gradient
      centrifugation, GFP tagging (fluorescence resonance energy
      transfer (FRET)), protein affinity chromatography, protein arrays,
      surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and GST pulldown assay with a
      known ligand of the target of interest as a probe. These same
      methods will be used to confirm the interaction of the target of
      interest and a peptide expressed by a recombinant virus.<br>
      <br>
      [0099] In another embodiment, the present invention provides the
      use of any of the peptides, polypeptides, proteins, protein
      fragments, and TOI complexes of the present invention in executing
      the methods of this invention. In another embodiment, the TOI
      complexes are<br>
      <br>
      [0100] In one embodiment, a TOI complex of the present invention
      may be used in a method to identify a peptide or polypeptide that
      has an intermolecular interaction with a target of interest as
      described hereinbelow. In another embodiment, the TOI complex may
      be used as part of a kit for identifying a peptide or polypeptide
      that has an intermolecular interaction with a target of interest,
      as described hereinbelow. In another embodiment, the TOI complex
      may be used in a method to identify an agonistic feature, an
      antagonistic feature of a peptide or polypeptide that has an
      intermolecular interaction with a receptor of interest, as
      described hereinbelow. In another embodiment, the TOI complex may
      be used in a method to identify a peptide or polypeptide that
      inhibits an enzyme of interest, as described hereinbelow. In
      another embodiment, the TOI complex may be used in a method to
      identify a peptide or polypeptide that has a functional feature
      with a receptor of interest, as described hereinbelow.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Method of Identifying a Peptide with an Intermolecular
        Interaction</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0101] In another embodiment, this invention provides a method of
      identifying a peptide or polypeptide having an intermolecular
      interaction with a target of interest by employing a recombinant
      virus or recombinant virus library of the present invention with a
      TOI complex also of the present invention or any embodiment
      thereof. The method comprises the steps of: contacting a
      recombinant virus library as exemplified hereinabove with a TOI
      complex as exemplified hereinabove, contacting said library with a
      plurality of cells, isolating viruses that did not infect said
      cells, providing infectious clones of isolated viruses by
      amplifying and expressing the genomes of said isolated viruses,
      repeating the above steps, and identifying peptides expressed by
      said viruses whereby intermolecular interactions between said
      target of interest and a peptide expressed by said recombinant
      virus result in said protease being in close proximity to said
      cleavage site, resulting in cleavage of said protein or protein
      fragment, comprising segments which are involved in viral
      attachment to, infection of, or a combination thereof of cells,
      and prevention of entry of a virus comprising a peptide involved
      in intermolecular interactions into said cells.<br>
      <br>
      [0102] In one embodiment, the method is predicated on the fact
      that viruses are inhibited or prevented from entry into a host
      cell as a result of the cleavage of their pIII protein as depicted
      in FIGS. 1 and 4. In one embodiment, if a protease were to cleave
      the pIII proteins of a bacteriophage at a site between the N2 and
      CT domains of pIII, the M13 bacteriophage would not be infective.
      In another embodiment, if a protease were to cleave the pIII
      proteins of a bacteriophage at a site between the N1 and N2
      domains of pIII, the M13 bacteriophage would not be infective. In
      one embodiment, the pIII protein cleavage is mediated by a
      protease that was brought into proximity of its cleavage site by
      the interaction of a target of interest proximal to the protease
      with a peptide proximal to the modified cleavage site on the pIII
      protein of the virus as depicted in FIG. 2.<br>
      <br>
      [0103] The steps are repeated for any number of cycles deemed
      sufficient to enrich the fraction for recombinant viruses that
      harbor peptides that bind to a target of interest and until there
      is a negligible number of background clones. In one embodiment,
      background clones refers to clones which harbor peptides that do
      not bind to a target of interest. In one embodiment, the number of
      cycles ranges between 3 and 50.<br>
      <br>
      [0104] In one embodiment, the identified peptide that has an
      intermolecular interaction with the target of interest is
      isolated. In one embodiment, the isolated viruses which have been
      prevented from entering into cells are found in the medium. The
      step of the isolation can be performed using methods that are well
      known in the art. In one embodiment the separation is performed by
      filtration. In another embodiment the separation is performed by
      spinning down, for example in a centrifuge. In another embodiment,
      the separation can be conducted by selectively providing
      conditions for the maintenance of the infected cells or,
      alternatively, conditions for the maintenance of the non-infective
      viruses.<br>
      <br>
      [0105] In another embodiment, the isolated viruses which have not
      infected cells are attached to the surface of the cells, but have
      not entered said cells. In one embodiment, the present invention
      further provides a recombinant virus, including a bacteriophage,
      comprising a label such that the label can be directly detected.
      The recombinant virus can express on its surface a peptide that
      has an intermolecular interaction with a selected protein. By
      “directly detected” is meant that the recombinant virus be labeled
      in advance and still comprise a peptide that binds its target upon
      addition of the target. Furthermore, by “label” is meant a means
      for visualization, such as a recognition site for direct
      phosphorylation, biotinylation, chemical linkages, etc. engineered
      into the recombinant virus, or such as a directly visualized label
      requiring no chemical reaction to detect, e.g., the recombinant
      virus expresses a fluorescent protein or is labeled by a
      radioactive moiety. Recombinant virus can be modified to include a
      label in advance, allowed to interact with the fusion protein of
      the present invention, be exposed to cells, and the cells
      separated from free recombinant virus in solution. Recombinant
      virus can then be visualized to detect the presence and
      localization of the recombinant virus, whether in the solution or
      in the cell fraction. Visualization may or may not require a
      chemical reaction. An example of a fluorescent protein is the
      green fluorescent protein (GFP) originally isolated from the
      jellyfish Aequorea Victoria. Another example of a fluorescent
      protein is the green fluorescent protein originally isolated from
      Renilla reniforms, which demonstrates a single absorption peak at
      498 nm and an emission peak at 509 nm. (Cubitt, et el. (1995) TUBS
      20: 448-455).<br>
      <br>
      [0106] The amino acid sequence of the identified peptide can be
      determined directly by conventional means of amino acid
      sequencing, or the coding sequence of the DNA encoding the
      polypeptide can frequently be determined more conveniently by use
      of standard DNA sequencing methods. The primary amino acid
      sequence can then be deduced from the corresponding DNA sequence.<br>
      <br>
      [0107] If the amino acid sequence is to be determined from the
      polypeptide itself, one may use micro sequencing techniques. The
      sequencing technique may include mass spectroscopy.<br>
      <br>
      [0108] The nucleic acid and protein sequences of the present
      invention can further be used as a “query sequence” to perform a
      search against sequence databases to, for example, identify other
      family members or related sequences. Such searches can be
      performed using the NBLAST and) (BLAST programs (version 2.0) of
      Altschul, et al. (J. Mol. Biol. 215:403-10 (1990)). BLAST
      nucleotide searches can be performed with the NBLAST program,
      score=100, word length=12 to obtain nucleotide sequences
      homologous to the nucleic acid molecules of the invention. BLAST
      protein searches can be performed with the XBLAST program,
      score=50, word length=3 to obtain amino acid sequences homologous
      to the proteins of the invention. To obtain gapped alignments for
      comparison purposes, Gapped BLAST can be utilized as described in
      Altschul et al. (Nucleic Acids Res. 25(17): 3389-3402 (1997)).
      When utilizing BLAST and gapped BLAST programs, the default
      parameters of the respective programs (e.g., XBLAST and NBLAST)
      can be used.<br>
      <br>
      [0109] In the method of the present invention, the recombinant
      virus library is contacted with a plurality of cells. The step of
      “contacting” or “introducing” refers hereinafter to bringing a
      solution comprising at least one element, (e.g., the recombinant
      virus) in contact with another element (e.g., the cells or a
      composition which comprise the cells).<br>
      <br>
      [0110] In one embodiment, the recombinant virus library of the
      method of identifying a peptide or polypeptide with an
      intermolecular interaction with a target of interest is produced
      in a phage. In another embodiment, the recombinant library is
      produced in M13 bacteriophage.<br>
      <br>
      [0111] In another embodiment, the recombinant viruses comprise
      peptides with mutations that abrogate binding to target of
      interest.<br>
      <br>
      [0112] In one embodiment, the term “mutation” refers to an
      insertion, deletion, or substitution of one or more natural or
      wild type nucleic acids for alternate nucleic acids. In one
      embodiment, the term “abrogate” means to abolish, do away with, or
      annul.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Epitope Mapping</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0113] In another embodiment, the peptide identified by this
      invention can serve for epitope mapping of the target of interest.
      “Epitope mapping” refers to methods used for studying the
      interactions of antibodies with specific regions of protein
      antigens.<br>
      <br>
      [0114] In one embodiment, the polypeptide is labeled. In another
      embodiment, the target of interest is labeled. A wide range of
      labels can be used, including but not limited to conjugating the
      target to biotin by conventional means. Alternatively, the label
      may comprise a fluorogen, an enzyme, an epitope, a chromogen, or a
      radionuclide. The detection means employed to detect the label
      will depend on the nature of the label and are known in the art,
      e.g., film to detect a radionuclide; an enzyme substrate that
      gives rise to a detectable signal to detect the presence of an
      enzyme; antibody to detect the presence of an epitope, etc.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Solid Support</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0115] In one embodiment, the target is not bound to a solid
      support and is added to the medium by, for example, contacting the
      solution of the recombinant virus with a solution that comprises
      the target of interest. In another embodiment, the target of
      interest of this invention may be bound to a solid support.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Kit</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0116] In another embodiment, this invention provides a kit for
      identifying a peptide or polypeptide involved in an intermolecular
      interaction with a target of interest comprising a recombinant
      virus peptide library of the present invention as exemplified
      hereinabove, a TOI complex of the present invention as exemplified
      hereinabove, and cells that are susceptible to viral attachment,
      infection or a combination thereof. In one embodiment, the kit of
      the present invention comprises a virus of the present invention,
      a library of the present invention, a TOI complex of the present
      invention or any combination thereof.<br>
      <br>
      [0117] Any of the compositions described herein may be comprised
      in a kit. The kits will thus comprise, in suitable container means
      for the vectors or cells of the present invention, and any
      additional agents that can be used in accordance with the present
      invention. In one embodiment, any container of the kit will
      additionally comprise a preservative, which, in one embodiment,
      will increase the “shelf life” of the kit component or components
      to which it is added.<br>
      <br>
      [0118] The kits may comprise suitably aliquoted compositions of
      the present invention. The components of the kits may be packaged
      either in aqueous media or in lyophilized form. The container
      means of the kits will generally include at least one vial, test
      tube, flask, bottle, syringe or other container means, into which
      a component may be placed, and preferably, suitably aliquoted.
      Where there is more than one component in the kit, the kit also
      will generally contain a second, third or other additional
      container into which the additional components may be separately
      placed. However, various combinations of components may be
      comprised in a vial.<br>
      <br>
      [0119] The kits of the present invention also will typically
      include a means for containing reagent containers in close
      confinement for commercial sale. Such containers may include
      injection or blow-molded plastic containers into which the desired
      vials are retained.<br>
      <br>
      [0120] When the components of the kit are provided in one and/or
      more liquid solutions, the liquid solution is an aqueous solution,
      with a sterile aqueous solution being particularly preferred.
      However, the components of the kit may be provided as dried
      powder(s). When reagents and/or components are provided as a dry
      powder, the powder can be reconstituted by the addition of a
      suitable solvent. It is envisioned that the solvent may also be
      provided in another container means.<br>
      <br>
      [0121] The kit optionally further comprises a means for detecting
      the presence of an interaction between a polypeptide and a target
      of interest or the absence of an interaction thereof.<br>
      <br>
      [0122] In one embodiment, the recombinant virus library of the kit
      for identifying a peptide or polypeptide with an intermolecular
      interaction with a target of interest is produced in a phage. In
      another embodiment, the recombinant library is produced in M13
      bacteriophage. In another embodiment, the recombinant viruses of
      the kit comprise peptides with mutations that abrogate binding to
      target of interest. In another embodiment, the peptide identified
      by said kit can be used for epitope mapping of the target of
      interest. In another embodiment, the target of interest of the kit
      is not bound to a solid support.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Identifying an Agonist or Antagonist</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0123] It should be likewise be apparent that the function of
      polypeptides can be identified, i.e. this invention enables, in
      one embodiment, to determine whether the peptide is an agonist or
      an antagonist to a receptor or if it is an inhibitor of an enzyme.
      In one embodiment, this invention provides a method of identifying
      a peptide or polypeptide that has an agonistic or an antagonistic
      effect on the target of interest of the invention by employing a
      recombinant virus or recombinant virus library of the present
      invention with a TOI complex also of the present invention or any
      embodiment thereof.<br>
      <br>
      [0124] It should likewise be apparent that a wide range of
      peptides or polypeptides that have an agonistic or an antagonistic
      effect on the target of interest of the invention, can be
      identified by the process of the invention, which comprises: (a)
      contacting the recombinant virus library as described hereinabove
      with a plurality of complexes as described hereinabove wherein the
      target of interest is a receptor; (b) contacting said recombinant
      virus library of step (a) with cells; (c) isolating viruses in (b)
      which have not infected said cells; (d) providing infectious
      clones of first isolated viruses of (c) by amplifying and
      expressing the genomes of said first isolated viruses; (e)
      contacting infectious clones of viruses of step (c) with the
      receptor of interest, wherein said receptor is not attached to a
      protease; (f) contacting the viruses of step (e) with a protein
      attached to a protease via a flexible linker, wherein said protein
      is involved in the downstream signal transduction pathway of said
      receptor of interest; (g) contacting the viruses of step (f) with
      cells; (h) separating viruses in (g) that have not infected said
      cells from viruses which have infected cells; (i) providing
      infectious clones of second isolated viruses of step (h) by
      amplifying and expressing the genomes of said second isolated
      viruses; (j) repeating steps (a)-(i); and (k) identifying peptides
      expressed by the viruses in step (h), whereby viruses which have
      not infected said cells in (h) express a peptide which has
      agonistic activity for said receptor of interest, and viruses
      which have infected said cells in (h) express a peptide which has
      antagonistic activity for said receptor.<br>
      <br>
      [0125] Knowing that a polypeptide exhibits a selective affinity to
      a target of interest, one may attempt to identify a drug that can
      exert an effect on the polypeptide-target of interest interaction,
      e.g., either as an agonist or as an antagonist of the interaction.
      With this assay, one can screen a collection of candidate “drugs”
      for the one exhibiting the most desired characteristic, e.g., the
      most efficacious in reverting the required vital process or
      function and whether it is an agonist or an antagonist to the
      target of interest.<br>
      <br>
      [0126] In one embodiment, the term “agonist” refers to an
      endogenous substance or drug that can interact with a receptor and
      initiate a physiological or a pharmacological response
      characteristic of that receptor (contraction, relaxation,
      secretion, enzyme activation, etc.)<br>
      <br>
      [0127] In one embodiment, the term “antagonist” refers to an
      endogenous substance or drug that blocks or nullifies an action of
      another endogenous substance or drug, such as a drug that binds to
      a receptor without initiating a physiological or a pharmacological
      response characteristic of that receptor.<br>
      <br>
      [0128] In order to isolate a peptide which has an antagonistic
      feature, the medium further comprises a ligand, which naturally
      binds the receptor of interest, and other components, may be added
      if required for the activation of the receptor, for example
      without limitation calcium, sodium, and magnesium ions, ATP, EDTA,
      DTT, etc.<br>

      </b><br>
      [0132] In another embodiment, this invention provides a method for
      identifying a peptide or polypeptide that inhibits an enzyme of
      interest by employing a recombinant virus or recombinant virus

      <br>
      <b>Identifying a Peptide with a Functional Feature</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0133] In another embodiment, this invention provides a method of
      identifying a peptide or polypeptide which has a functional
      feature with a receptor of interest by employing a recombinant
      virus or recombinant virus library of the present invention with a
      TOI complex also of the present invention or any embodiment
      thereof. In another embodiment, this invention provides a method
      of identifying a peptide or polypeptide which has a functional
      feature with a receptor of interest comprising the steps of: (a)
      contacting the recombinant virus library as described hereinabove
      with a plurality of complexes as described hereinabove wherein the
      target of interest is a receptor; (b) contacting said recombinant
      virus library of step (a) with cells; (c) isolating viruses in (b)
      which have not infected said cells; (d) providing infectious

      and viruses which have infected said cells in (h) express a
      peptide which has a functional feature with regards to said
      receptor of interest.<br>
      <br>
      [0134] In one embodiment, the recombinant virus library of the
      method for identifying a peptide or polypeptide with an agonistic,
      antagonistic, enzyme inhibitory, or functional effect with respect
      to a target of interest is produced in a phage. In another
      embodiment, the recombinant library is produced in M13
      bacteriophage. In another embodiment, the recombinant viruses of
      the methods comprise peptides with mutations that abrogate binding
      to target of interest. In another embodiment, the receptor or
      enzyme of interest is not bound to a solid support. In another
      embodiment, the isolated viruses which have not infected cells,
      either after the step of introducing the receptor or enzyme of
      interest attached to a protease or after the step of introducing
      the protein (downstream signal transducer or enzyme substrate)
      attached to a protease or both, are attached to the surface of the
      cells, but have not entered said cells.<br>
      <br>
      [0135] This invention is also directed to a composition which can
      be useful in the screening of drug candidates. In one embodiment
      of the invention, this invention provides a composition
      comprising: a recombinant virus peptide library made in accordance
      with the embodiments of the present invention and a target of
      interest connected to a protease.<br>
      <br>
      [0136] With this assay, one can screen a collection of peptides
      for the one that exhibits the most desired characteristic. For
      example, the peptide that is most efficacious in activating the
      target of interest may be selected. Alternatively, the peptide
      that is most efficacious in blocking, inhibiting or competing with
      a ligand, which binds and activates the target of interest, may be
      selected.<br>
      <br>
      [0137] In one embodiment, an advantage to the present methodology
      may comprise functional selection, which is an inherent part of
      the assay, saving cumbersome and time-consuming screenings at
      later stages. In another embodiment, sporadic deletion mutants
      that occur in the selection process using conventional techniques
      are avoided in the technology of the present invention. In another
      embodiment, non-specific binding problems resulting from tagging
      targets to a solid matrix are avoided, because a solid support is
      not necessary for the technology. In another embodiment, transient
      interactions, such as enzymes with their substrates can be
      detected by this technology. Finally, in another embodiment, this
      invention allows superior detection of proteins with either low-
      or high-affinity binding to a target of interest.<br>
      <br>
      [0138] It should be likewise be apparent that the function of the
      polypeptides can be identified, i.e. this invention enables, in
      one embodiment, to determine whether the polypeptide can block the
      action of a toxin or whether it has an enhancing or an inhibiting
      effect on other processes such as cellular, biochemical, or
      physiological processes, such as cellular signal transduction,
      transcriptional regulation, translational regulation, cell
      adhesion, migration or transport, cytokine secretion and other
      aspects of the immune response, and the like.<br>
      <br>
      [0139] In one embodiment, the peptides identified by the present
      invention may be used for diagnosis of a disease or for treating a
      disorder characterized by an absence of, inappropriate, or
      unwanted expression of the protein. Accordingly, methods for
      treatment include the use of the identified protein or fragments
      thereof. In another embodiment, the peptides identified by the
      present invention may be used to identify a person who is
      vulnerable to or has a proliferative disorder, which in one
      embodiment, is a cancer. In another embodiment, may be used to
      identify a person who is vulnerable to or has an infection, in
      another embodiment, an HIV infection, in another embodiment, a
      developmental disorder, while in another embodiment, a metabolic
      disorder. In another embodiment, peptides identified by the
      present invention may be used to treat a person with cancer. In
      another embodiment, peptides identified by the present invention
      may be used to treat a person with a proliferative disorder, an
      infection, an HIV infection, a developmental disorder, or a
      metabolic disorder. In another embodiment, it may be used to
      suppress, inhibit, or prevent any of the disorders mentioned
      hereinabove.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SoAP Assay Containing a Sterically Inhibiting Group</b><br>
      <br>
      [0140] In another embodiment, this invention provides a second
      recombinant virus comprising: at least one protein or protein
      fragment, comprising segments which are involved in a vital
      process; a peptide or polypeptide which differs by at least one
      amino acid from another peptide or polypeptide in said library; a
      modified cleavage site proximal to said peptide and to said
      protein; and a sterically inhibiting group, wherein said
      sterically inhibiting group inhibits the function of said protein
      essential for a vital process.<br>
      <br>
      [0141] The invention also provides a second library comprising
      such recombinant viruses.<br>
      <br>
      [0142] In one embodiment, this invention provides a replicable
      genetic package peptide library, such as a second recombinant
      virus library, for identifying potential new drug candidates and
      lead compounds. In another embodiment, the invention provides
      methods for identifying the agonistic or antagonistic features of
      a peptide identified as having an intermolecular interaction with
      a target of interest. In another embodiment, this invention
      provides compositions, which can serve in an assay kit, for
      screening peptides for their ability to bind to a target of
      interest. In another embodiment, this invention provides
      compositions for screening peptides for their agonistic or
      antagonistic features.<br>
      <br>
      [0143] In one embodiment, the sterically inhibiting group
      comprises a selectable marker. The selectable marker can be any
      selectable marker, which is known in the art, such as antibiotic
      resistance protein, for example, without being limited,
      ampicillin. The selectable marker can be also used for deletion
      mutants counter selection, when there is a need to select cells
      that are infected by virus that did not lose essential genes. In
      another embodiment, the protein essential for vital cellular
      process is a protein required for survival, infectivity or
      propagation. In another embodiment, the modified cleavage site is
      inserted between said peptide and said at least one protein
      essential for infectivity or propagation.<br>
      <br>
      [0144] In one embodiment, the present invention provides a
      replicable genetic package peptide library wherein each replicable
      genetic package comprises at least one protein or protein
      fragment, which is involved in a vital process; a peptide or
      polypeptide, which differs by at least one amino acid from another
      peptide or polypeptide in said library; a modified cleavage site
      proximal to said peptide and to said protein; and a sterically
      inhibiting group, wherein said sterically inhibiting group
      inhibits the function of said protein essential for a vital
      process.<br>
      <br>
      [0145] The invention also provides a library of such replicable
      genetic packages.<br>
      <br>
      [0146] In one embodiment, the selectable marker is a part of the
      sterically inhibiting group. In another embodiment, the selectable
      marker is an antibiotic resistance gene. In another embodiment,
      the protein essential for vital cellular process is a protein
      required for survival, infectivity or propagation. In another
      embodiment, the modified cleavage site is inserted between said
      peptide and said at least one protein essential for infectivity or
      propagation.<br>
      <br>
      [0147] In another embodiment, the genetic package is for example,
      without limitation, eukaryotic cell, bacteria, a virus, or a
      phage.<br>
      <br>
      [0148] In one embodiment, the present invention provides a method
      of identifying a peptide having intermolecular interaction with a
      target of interest comprising the steps of: (a) introducing a
      target of interest attached to a protease to said second
      recombinant virus library of claim 1; (b) contacting said second
      recombinant virus library with cells; and (c) detecting viruses
      that are propagating, wherein if a cell comprises a recombinant
      virus which contain a peptide that has affinity to the target of
      interest, the sterically inhibiting group will be cleaved off and
      the virus will propagate.<br>
      <br>
      [0149] In one embodiment, said peptide is an agonist, an
      antagonist, an antigen, an enzyme activating substrate, an
      inhibitor, a DNA or RNA binding peptide, transcription or
      translation activator or repressor. In another embodiment, the
      target of interest is a receptor, an antibody, a carrier, an
      information protein, a hormone, a regulatory protein, a structural
      protein, a toxin, an enzyme, DNA, RNA, oligonucleotide, synthetic
      or physiological polymer or a small organic molecule. In another
      embodiment, said peptide is used for epitope mapping of the target
      of interest. In another embodiment, the recombinant virus library
      is in M13 bacteriophage. In another embodiment, the protein
      essential for infectivity or propagation is pIII. In another
      embodiment, the target of interest is not bound to a solid
      support.<br>
      <br>
      [0150] In one embodiment, there is provided a method of
      identifying a peptide having an intermolecular interaction with a
      target of interest comprising the steps of: preparing a second
      recombinant virus library according to an embodiment of the
      invention, wherein at least portion of the second recombinant
      virus is inactivated by the sterically inhibiting group attached
      to a protein essential for a vital process, and the inactivation
      can be reverted upon the removal of the sterically inhibiting
      group; introducing a target of interest, which is attached to a
      protease to said second recombinant virus library; the cell
      culture will be enriched with cells infected by a second
      recombinant virus which comprises a peptide that has affinity to
      the target of interest, due to the removal of the sterically
      inhibiting group, and the second virus will propagate.<br>
      <br>
      [0151] The method is based on the concept that only when the
      target of interest interacts with a peptide, the susceptibility of
      the modified protease site to proteolysis is reverted, and the
      sterically inhibiting group is removed and enables the protein
      which is essential to a vital process to function. It should be
      noted in this respect that the level of the proteolytic activity
      is dependent on the affinity between the target protein and the
      peptide of the second library which is attached to the modified
      protease site. The methods of the invention are not limited to one
      cycle. Rather, in one embodiment, the method is performed with one
      cycle. In another embodiment, the method is performed with two
      cycles. In another embodiment, the method is performed with three
      cycles. In another embodiment, the method is performed with four
      cycles. In another embodiment, the method is performed with five
      cycles. In another embodiment, the method is performed with seven
      cycles. In another embodiment, the method is performed with nine
      cycles.<br>
      <br>
      [0152] In one embodiment, the present invention provides a method
      of identifying a peptide or polypeptide, which has intermolecular
      interaction with a target of interest comprising the steps of:
      introducing a target of interest contacted to a protease to said
      replicable genetic package of claim 6; and detecting the
      replicable genetic package which propagates or survives, wherein
      only if the replicable genetic package contains a peptide that has
      affinity to the target of interest, the sterically inhibiting
      group will be cleaved off and the replicable genetic package will
      be able to propagate or survive.<br>
      <br>
      [0153] In one embodiment, said peptide is an agonist, an
      antagonist, an antigen, an enzyme activating substrate, an
      inhibitor, a DNA or RNA binding peptide, transcription or
      translation activator or repressor. In another embodiment, the
      target of interest is a receptor, an antibody, a carrier, an
      information protein, a hormone, a regulatory protein, a structural
      protein, a toxin or an enzyme, a DNA, an RNA, an oligonucleotide,
      a synthetic polymer or a small organic molecule. In another
      embodiment, said replicable genetic package is a eukaryotic cell,
      bacteria, a virus, or a phage. In another embodiment, the target
      of interest is not bound to a solid support.<br>

      or polypeptide, which has an intermolecular interaction with a
      target of interest, isolated according to any of the methods
      described herein.<br>
      <br>
      [0157] It should likewise be apparent that a wide range of
      polypeptides that have a function i.e. have an agonistic or an
      antagonistic effect on the target of interest of the invention,
      can be identified by the process of the invention. In one
      embodiment, the present invention provides a method of identifying
      an agonistic or antagonistic feature of a peptide, which has
      intermolecular interaction with a receptor of interest comprising
      the steps of: (a) contacting a receptor of interest connected to a

      (d) contacting the propagated viruses of step c with the receptor
      of interest; (e) contacting the viruses of step d with a protein
      attached to protease, wherein said protein is downstream in the
      signal transduction pathway of the receptor of interest; (f)
      contacting the viruses of step e with cells; and (g) separating
      the cells obtained in step f, so as to obtain infected cells and
      non infecting viruses, wherein if a virus infects a cell, it
      contains a peptide which has an agonistic feature and if a virus
      is a non infecting virus it contains a peptide which has an
      antagonistic feature, thereby identifying an agonistic or
      antagonistic feature of a peptide, which has intermolecular
      interaction with a receptor of interest.<br>
      <br>
      [0158] In one embodiment, the present invention provides a method
      of identifying peptide which has a functional feature with a
      receptor of interest comprising the steps of: (a) contacting a
      receptor of interest connected to a protease, to the second
      recombinant virus peptide library as described hereinabove; (b)
      contacting said second recombinant virus library with cells; (c)
      detecting the propagated viruses, wherein if a cell comprises a
      second recombinant virus which comprises a peptide that has
      affinity to the target of interest, the sterically inhibiting
      group will cleave off enabling the virus propagation; (d)
      contacting the propagated viruses of step c with said receptor of
      interest; (e) contacting the viruses of step d with a ligand to
      the receptor of interest attached to the protease; (f) contacting
      the viruses of step e with host cells; and (g) separating the
      infected cells and the non infecting viruses obtain in step f, so
      as to obtain infected cells and non infecting viruses, wherein if
      a virus infects a cell, it contains a peptide which does not have
      functional feature and if the virus is a non infecting virus it
      contains a peptide which has a functional feature, thereby
      identifying a peptide which has a functional feature with a
      receptor of interest.<br>
      <br>
      [0159] In one embodiment, the term “functional feature” refers
      hereinbelow to any function that the peptide might produce on the
      receptor of interest, namely agonistic reaction or antagonistic
      reaction.<br>
      <br>
      [0160] In one embodiment, the present invention provides a method
      of identifying peptide that inhibits an enzyme of interest
      comprising the steps of: (a) contacting an enzyme of interest
      connected to a protease, to the second recombinant virus peptide
      library as described hereinabove; (b) contacting said second
      recombinant virus library with cells; (c) detecting the propagated
      viruses, wherein if a cell comprises a second recombinant virus,
      which comprises a peptide that has affinity to the enzyme of
      interest, the sterically inhibiting group will cleave off enabling
      the virus propagation; (d) contacting the viruses of step c with
      said enzyme of interest; (e) contacting the viruses of step d with
      a substrate of the enzyme, wherein said substrate is attached to a

      (g) separating said cells by spinning down or filtration, so as to
      obtain infected cells in the pellet or and non infecting viruses
      which contain a peptide which inhibits an enzyme inhibiting
      peptide in the supernatant; thereby identifying peptide which
      inhibits an enzyme of interest.<br>
      <br>
      [0161] In one embodiment, the present invention provides a method
      of identifying a peptide that activates an enzyme of interest
      comprising the steps of: (a) contacting an enzyme of interest
      connected to a protease, to the second recombinant virus peptide
      library as described hereinabove; (b) contacting said second
      recombinant virus library with cells; (c) detecting the propagated
      viruses, wherein if a cell comprises a second recombinant virus,
      which comprises a peptide that has affinity to the enzyme of
      interest, the sterically inhibiting group will cleave off enabling
      the virus propagation; (d) contacting the viruses propagated in
      step c with said enzyme of interest; (e) contacting the viruses of
      step d with a substrate of the enzyme, wherein said substrate is
      attached to a protease; (f) contacting the viruses of claim e with
      cells; (g) detecting the propagated viruses, wherein if a cell
      comprises a recombinant virus, the virus comprises a peptide which
      activates the enzyme of interest, the sterically inhibiting group
      will cleave off enabling the virus propagation; and (h) separating
      the non infecting viruses from infected cells, thereby obtaining
      enriched population of peptides which activates an enzyme of
      interest.<br>
      <br>
      [0162] The methods of identification the function of the
      identified peptide, its agonistic or antagonistic property, or
      whether it activates or inhibits an enzyme are not limited to
      second recombinant virus libraries. The methods may be applied in
      any replicable genetic packages. In one embodiment, the present
      invention provides a method of identifying an agonistic or
      antagonistic feature of a peptide, which has intermolecular
      interaction with a receptor of interest comprising the steps of:
      (a) contacting a receptor of interest connected to a protease, to
      said replicable genetic package as described hereinabove; (b)
      detecting the replicable genetic package which propagate or
      survive, wherein if a replicable genetic package comprises peptide
      that has affinity to the to the target of interest, the sterically
      inhibiting group will be cleave off and the replicable genetic
      package will propagate or survival; (c) contacting the replicable
      genetic package of step b with the receptor of interest; (d)
      contacting the replicable genetic package of step d with a protein
      attached to protease, wherein said protein is downstream in the
      signal transduction pathway of the receptor of interest; and (e)
      separating the replicable genetic package obtained in step d,
      wherein if a replicable genetic package propagates or survives, it
      contains a peptide which has an agonistic feature.<br>
      <br>
      [0163] In one embodiment, the present invention provides a method
      of identifying peptide which has a functional feature with a
      receptor of interest comprising the steps of: (a) contacting a
      receptor of interest connected to a protease, to the replicable
      genetic package as described hereinabove; (b) detecting the
      replicable genetic package which propagate or survive, wherein if
      a replicable genetic package comprises a peptide that has affinity
      to the target of interest the sterically inhibiting group will
      cleaved off enabling the replicable genetic package propagation or
      survive; (c) contacting the replicable genetic package of step b
      with a ligand to the receptor of interest attached to the
      protease; and (d) separating the replicable genetic package which
      survive or propagate, thereby identifying a peptide which has a
      functional feature with a receptor of interest.<br>
      <br>
      [0164] In one embodiment, the present invention provides a method
      of identifying a peptide that activates an enzyme of interest
      comprising the steps of: (a) contacting an enzyme of interest
      connected to a protease, to the replicable genetic package as
      described hereinabove; (b) detecting the replicable genetic
      package which survives or propagates, wherein if a replicable
      genetic package comprises a peptide that has affinity to the
      enzyme of interest, the sterically inhibiting group was cleave off
      enabling the virus propagation; (c) contacting the replicable
      genetic package of step b with said enzyme of interest; (d)
      contacting the replicable genetic package of step c with a
      substrate of the enzyme, wherein said substrate is attached to a
      protease; and (e) detecting the replicable genetic package which
      survives or propagates, wherein if said replicable genetic package
      comprises a peptide that activates the enzyme of interest, the
      inhibiting group is cleaved off enabling the replicable genetic
      package propagation; thereby identifying a peptide which activates
      an enzyme of interest.<br>
      <br>
      [0165] The concept of this embodiment of the invention is to
      attach a sterically inhibiting group, which comprises a modified
      protease cleavage site and a peptide library to a protein which is
      essential to any vital process of any organism so as to inhibit a
      function of the essential protein. The modified organism is then
      contacted with a target of interest attached to a protease. Only
      when the target of interest has affinity to a peptide of the
      peptide library, the sterically inhibiting group will be cleaved
      off and the function of the protein, which is essential to a vital
      process, will be reverted.<br>
      <br>
      [0166] In one embodiment, the peptide and modified protease site,
      which are attached to the protein that is essential to a vital
      process, form a sterically inhibiting group.<br>
      <br>
      [0167] By the word “sterically inhibiting group” or “steric
      hindrance” it is meant interference with a feasible chemical
      reaction. Here it means physical inhibition of the protein
      function by attaching a chemical group to a protein, which protein
      is essential for a vital process.<br>
      <br>
      [0168] The virus library may utilize a number of expression
      vehicles known to those of ordinary skill, including but not
      limited to, recombinant bacteriophage, lambda phage, M13, a
      recombinant plasmid or cosmid, and the like. If the virus used is
      M13, the protein, which is essential for propagation and
      infectivity, may be without limitation, pIII or pVIII and the
      like. Accordingly, the M13 cannot be infective when a sterically
      inhibiting group is attached for example, to the N terminus of
      pIII and would be activated only upon the removal of the
      sterically inhibiting group by, for example, a suitable protease.<br>
      <br>
      [0169] A prophetic example which demonstrates the concept of the
      invention is the use of auxotrophic bacteria. An auxotrophic
      bacterium is a mutant bacterium that requires nutrients that wild
      type bacteria are able to synthesize themselves. For example, an
      arginine mutant requires a nutritional supplement of arginine in
      order to grow, because it lacks the enzyme responsible for
      arginine production. Any of the methods of the present invention
      may use auxotrophic bacteria, in which the missing enzyme is
      expressed in a plasmid, fused to a sterically inhibiting group
      that comprises peptide library, a modified protease site, and
      optionally an antibiotic resistance protein (for the deletion
      mutants counter selection), wherein the sterically inhibiting
      group inhibits the activity of the enzyme. These bacteria can grow
      only on rich media. Growing the bacteria on minimal medium will
      select for the bacterial cells expressing peptide that interact
      with the target of interest, because the sterically inhibiting
      group in these cells will be preferably cleaved off, and the
      enzyme will revert its full activity. It should be noted that the
      rate of the bacteria growth will be dependent on the interaction
      of the target with the peptide.<br>
      <br>
      [0170] In another embodiment, the method can be performed with
      cells that can grow in a medium containing a specific antibiotic
      and express the antibiotic resistance gene fused to the sterically
      inhibiting group. The antibiotic resistance gene will be activated
      only when the sterically inhibiting group will be removed and the
      cells will be able than to propagate. The cells may be further
      containing an antibiotic resistance gene for the deletion mutants
      counter selection.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLES</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0171] M13, as well as fd and fl, is a filamentous Ff
      bacteriophage. The phage minor coat gene 3 protein (pIII) of M13
      bacteriophage (FIG. 1A) allows the phage to infect bacteria by
      interacting with the bacterial F pilus and later with the integral
      membrane protein ToIA. Specifically, the CT domain of pIII anchors
      pIII to the phage coat, while the N2 domain interacts with
      bacterial F pilus and the N1 domain forms a complex with the
      C-terminal of ToIA at later stages of infection.<br>
      <br>
      [0172] One of skill in the art would be well equipped to construct
      a vector through standard recombinant techniques (see, for
      example, Maniatis, et al., Molecular Cloning, A laboratory Manual
      (Cold Spring Harbor, 1990) and Ausubel, et al., 1994, Current
      Protocols In Molecular Biology (John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1996), both
      incorporated herein by reference).<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 1</b><b><br>
      </b><b>Development of a Recombinant Virus Library with a Modified
        Protease Site</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0173] M13 is only active (i.e. able to infect) when the N2 and N1
      domains are tightly linked to the CT domain, which is linked to
      the capsid of the phage. In addition, a phage remains active if
      any one of its 3-5 pIII units is functional. Thus, insertion of a
      protease cleavage site between the CT and the N2 domains of pIII
      would render the phage inactive (FIG. 1B) upon incubation with a
      suitable amount and type of protease.<br>
      <br>
      [0174] In order to develop a system in which interaction of
      heterologous proteins may be assessed, a protease and protease
      cleavage site pair is chosen, wherein cleavage will only occur if
      the protease and the protease cleavage site are brought into close
      proximity by another group (FIG. 2). Thus, an appropriate modified
      protease cleavage site of the pair should have minimal affinity
      for its protease but at the same time, should sustain high
      proteolytic activity when it comes into contact with its protease.
      Thus, if the protease described above is fused to a target protein
      and the protease cleavage site in the pIII protein is cross-linked
      to a target protein ligand, the specific proteolytic activity of
      the protease will be activated by bringing the protease and
      protease cleavage site into close proximity (FIG. 2). A higher
      affinity of the target protein to the target protein ligand would
      be expected to increase the proteolytic activity.<br>
      <br>
      [0175] Each of the recombinant proteins in the system, such as the
      protease-target protein and the modified cleavage site-target
      protein ligand, are separated by long flexible linkers to enable a
      good degree of rotational freedom, which in turn allows
      interaction between the components of the system. The linkers
      chosen may include a leucine zipper. Any other flexible linker
      could be used as well.<br>
      <br>
      [0176] The 76 amino acid-long ubiquitin proteolytic site (Genbank
      X01474; PID: g4741) and one of ubiquitin's specific proteases,
      UBP1 (Genbank M63484; PID: g173126) are identified as suitable
      candidates for modified cleavage site and protease, respectively
      (FIG. 3). UBP1 specifically cleaves ubiquitin after its C-terminal
      glycine. A modified ubiquitin structure that is bound by UBP1 with
      very low or no affinity but has a preserved UBP1 cleavage site is
      generated using a mutagenesis library of ubiquitin generated by
      PCR.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 2</b><b><br>
      </b><b>Testing of a Recombinant Virus Library with a Modified
        Ubiquitin Site</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0177] The two parts of a leucine-zipper are used to evaluate the
      functionality of the modified ubiquitin system in the present
      invention (FIG. 3). The protease cleavage site is cross-linked to
      one part of the leucine zipper, and the protease is engineered as
      a fusion protein with another part of the leucine zipper. When
      combined, the two parts of the leucine zipper interact, resulting
      in the association of the LTBP1 with modified ubiquitin. Any other
      two interacting molecules could be used, but they should
      preferably be small and have a strong affinity for one another.<br>
      <br>
      [0178] Engineered and wild type bacteriophages are incubated with
      and without the target ligand fusion protein. After incubation of
      the phages with the fusion protein, bacteria are added to the
      medium. After incubation of the phages with bacteria, bacteria are
      removed from the medium to separate bacteriophages in the medium
      from those that invaded the bacterial host cell (FIG. 4). Bacteria
      are then washed and resuspended in water. The genomes of the
      inactive phages that are not able to infect the bacterial cells
      are rescued from the filtrate by PCR. Alternatively, the genomes
      of the active phages from the bacterial cells are rescued by PCR.<br>
      <br>
      [0179] Wild type bacteriophages and engineered bacteriophages that
      were not exposed to the target protein ligand are found in high
      levels in the host bacteria. However, bacteriophages engineered
      with the leucine zipper construct cross-linked to the modified
      ubiquitin described above are found in high levels in the
      incubation medium, indicating that the pIII protein was cleaved
      and the phage thus rendered non-infective. Thus, in the engineered
      bacteriophage system described hereinabove, the inability of a
      phage to invade a host cell indicates the presence of a
      protein-protein interaction.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 3</b><b><br>
      </b><b>SoIP Assay to Identify Peptide that Interacts with a Target
        of Interest</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0180] Next, a library of M13 bacteriophages is created which
      contain an insertion of the modified protease cleavage site
      (ubiquitin) and a random peptide between the CT and N2 domains of
      pIII (FIG. 2, 5A). The target protein is fused to one half of a
      leucine zipper, and a protease (UBP1) is fused to a second half of
      a leucine zipper. The target protein and UBP1 are then
      cross-linked by the leucine zipper (FIG. 2, 5A), creating a
      complex comprising the target of interest. After incubation of the
      M13 library with the target fusion protein (FIG. 5A-B), bacteria
      are added to the medium (FIG. 5C). After an appropriate incubation
      (FIG. 5D), bacteria are separated from the medium, and the genomes
      of the active and inactive phages are separated, recovered, and
      sequenced as described hereinabove.<br>
      <br>
      [0181] Bacteriophages that successfully invade the bacterial host
      cell are expected have at least one intact pIII protein,
      indicating that the target protein and target protein ligand did
      not have a high affinity (FIG. 4). Bacteriophage in the medium are
      expected to be missing all of their pIII proteins, indicating that
      the target protein and target protein ligand displayed high
      affinity binding (FIG. 4). In this way, novel targets of a
      characterized protein can be isolated from libraries.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 4</b><b><br>
      </b><b>SoIP Assay to Identify a Functional Interaction Between
        Peptide and Target of Interest</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0182] The positive or negative functionality of novel targets of
      a characterized protein may be characterized using the method
      described herein.<br>
      <br>
      [0183] In the case where the target of interest is a receptor, the
      first step is to perform the technique described Example 3 to
      screen a peptide library for a peptide that interacts with a
      receptor protein whose downstream signaling molecule is
      characterized. Then, clones of cells that were non-infective in
      Example 3 are incubated with a receptor protein that is not fused
      to a protease (UBP1). Next, the protease (UBP1) is engineered as a
      fusion protein with a protein known to be involved in the
      downstream signaling of the target (FIG. 6B). After incubation of
      the recombinant virus library with the known signaling molecule
      fusion protein, bacteria are added to the medium. After an
      appropriate incubation, bacteria are separated from the medium,
      and the genomes of the active and inactive phages are separated
      and recovered as described hereinabove.<br>
      <br>
      [0184] If the peptide expressed by the recombinant bacteriophage
      is an antagonist of the receptor of interest, then it will bind
      the receptor of interest and prevent an interaction of the
      receptor with its downstream protein. Thus, there will be no
      opportunity for interaction between the protease and modified
      cleavage site, because the downstream protein, which is linked to
      a protease, will not interact with the receptor of interest and
      the peptide, which are in close proximity to the modified cleavage
      site. Thus, the pIII protein of the bacteriophage will remain
      intact, along with the ability of the phage to infect (FIG. 6D).
      Thus, bacteriophage localized in cells express peptides that are
      antagonistic with respect to the receptor of interest.<br>
      <br>
      [0185] If the peptide expressed by the recombinant bacteriophage
      is an agonist of the receptor of interest, then it will bind the
      receptor of interest and lead to an interaction of the activated
      receptor with its downstream protein. The proximity of the
      downstream protein, which is linked to a protease, to the receptor
      of interest and the peptide, which are in close proximity to the
      modified cleavage site, will lead to the cleavage of the cleavage
      site by the protease, the loss of the pIII protein, and the loss
      of ability to infect (FIG. 6C). Thus, bacteriophage in the medium
      express peptides that are agonistic with respect to the receptor
      of interest.<br>
      <br>
      [0186] A second illustration of the assay's ability to exhibit
      functionality of a peptide is the case where the target of
      interest is an enzyme. The first step is to perform the technique
      described Example 3 to screen a peptide library for a peptide or
      peptides that interact with an enzyme whose substrate is
      characterized. Then, clones of cells that were non-infective in
      Example 3 are incubated with an enzyme that is not fused to a
      protease (UBP1). Next, the protease (UBP1) is engineered as a
      fusion protein with the enzyme substrate (FIG. 6B). After
      incubation of the recombinant virus library with the known enzyme
      substrate fusion protein, bacteria are added to the medium. After
      an appropriate incubation, bacteria are separated from the medium,
      and the genomes of the active and inactive phages are separated
      and recovered as described hereinabove.<br>
      <br>
      [0187] If the peptide expressed by the recombinant bacteriophage
      is an inhibitor of the enzyme of interest, then it will bind the
      enzyme of interest and prevent an interaction of the enzyme with
      its substrate. Thus, there will be no opportunity for interaction
      between the protease and modified cleavage site, because the
      enzyme substrate, which is linked to a protease, will not interact
      with the enzyme of interest and the peptide, which are in close
      proximity to the modified cleavage site. Thus, the pIII protein of
      the bacteriophage will remain intact, along with the ability of
      the phage to infect (FIG. 6D). Thus, bacteriophage localized in
      cells express peptides that are inhibitors of the enzyme of
      interest.<br>
      <br>
      [0188] If the peptide expressed by the recombinant bacteriophage
      is an activator of the enzyme of interest, then it will bind the
      enzyme of interest and lead to an interaction of the activated
      enzyme with its substrate. The proximity of the substrate, which
      is linked to a protease, to the enzyme of interest and the
      peptide, which are in close proximity to the modified cleavage
      site, will lead to the cleavage of the cleavage site by the
      protease, the loss of the pIII protein, and the loss of ability to
      infect (FIG. 6C). Thus, bacteriophage in the medium express
      peptides that are activators of the enzyme of interest. In this
      way, the way in which the novel peptide affects characterized
      target-ligand interactions may be assessed.<br>
