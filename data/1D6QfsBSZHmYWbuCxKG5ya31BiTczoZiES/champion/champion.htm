        <p><b>Dr. Joe Champion</b> <br>

      <p>This paper was prepared in 2000 and published in 2001. Since
        the publication six years ago all of the mathematical
        formalization remain constant. However, the application of the
        process has changed to produce higher yields of gold. Now if you
        replicate this process and have high commercial yields of gold,
        I would appreciate an email. Normally what has been observed is
        a conversion of 1.0% gold from the silver.&nbsp; The last test
        of the modified system occurred on September 2007. </p>
      <p>For those wanting the updated procedure or have general
        questions please email me : <b>drc@drjoechampion.com</b> </p>
      <p>Good luck! </p>
      <p><b>Personal Note...</b> </p>
      <p>This document is the first of a series of technologies that
        allows for the formation of new elements by an event that has
        eluded science. In the first part of this paper, one can safely
        convert silver (Ag) to gold (Au) in the confines of their home
        or laboratory. Next is a the complete theory has to 'why' the
        process works and finally is a procedure for the production of
        Au in its pure state that requires laboratory apparatuses and
        training. </p>
      <center>
        <p><b><font size="+1">General</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>In the formation of Ag (or other elements) from a dimensional
        reaction, the conversion will occur without excess energies or
        nuclear signatures. By heating Ag to a temperature of 43.2 oC.
        The principle is straightforward and simple without toxicity. </p>
      <p>By utilizing a heat source that is stable and capable of
        heating in the range of 100 =&gt; 120o C assemble a vessel
        similar to that shown in Figure 1. </p>
      <p>Allow the temperature of the silver to stabilize at the
        pre-mentioned temperature. It is important that you measure the
        temperature of the silver and not that of the sand. The function
        of the sand is to provide an even influx of temperature to the
        entire area of the silver and it provides an excellent
        insulator. </p>
      <p>The temperature of 43.2 oC is optimum under ideal conditions.
        However, it is possible that the temperature may vary within the
        statistical limits shown in Table 1. When the temperature is
        exact for the reaction the silver with become endothermic. This
        means that the temperature will be slightly greater than that of
        the surrounding sand. A point of interest - this reaction is the
        same as observed in the working Cold Fusion cells of the past.
        The scientists were not observing a low energy nuclear event,
        they were observing an inter-dimensional phenomenon. </p>
      <p>To achieve maximum convergence of Ag to Au will depend on the
        dwell time at resonance temperature. To date, visible conversion
        of Ag to Au has occurred in as little as six hours, with 2%
        conversion taking up to 24 hours. </p>
      <p>The reaction is safe and produces no toxicities. </p>
      <center>
        <p><b><font size="+1">Theory</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>The conversion of one element (specifically one isotope) to
        another through a dimensional reaction occurs under select
        conditions of phonon resonance. Dimensional phonon resonance
        occurs when the space occupied by one isotope is exactly the
        same as that of another isotope in its rest state. This event
        only occur under the following two conditions: the expansion of
        an isotope by heating; or, the contraction of an isotope by
        cooling. </p>
      <p>Due to the natural characteristics of elemental properties,
        this event is extremely rare and one can only force the event
        under select conditions. To determine the phonon resonance of an
        isotope, it is necessary to apply the following formula: </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="formula1.gif" width="265" height="55"></p>
      </center>
      <p><br>
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>whereas, d - Density in gm/cm3 <br>
        Na - Avogadro's Constant <br>
        m - mass </p>
      <p>By determining the inverse, one will observe the linear atomic
        spacing. </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="formula2.gif" width="267" height="63"></p>
      </center>
      <p>Since the resonance frequency and spacing is required for all
        isotopes, the calculations for most isotopes may be reviewed in
        the attachments to this document. Following is an abstract of
        the data: </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="table2.gif" width="619" height="133"></p>
      </center>
      <p>When an element is heated or cooled, the atomic spacing will
        change proportionally to the cube of the product of the
        temperature (increase/decrease) and the expansion coefficient.
        To understand, following is the mathematical model for
        determining the linear spacing in reference to temperature: </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="formula3.gif" width="271" height="84"></p>
      </center>
      <p>whereas, t - temperature increase <br>
        St - standardized temperature <br>
        Ec - expansion coefficient </p>
      <p>To place this in perspective, to determine the exacting
        temperature for a dimensional phonon reaction to occur, requires
        knowing the starting element (specifically the isotope of the
        starting element if more than one) and the element to be
        produced. Once this is known, you can apply the following
        formula: </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="formula4.gif" width="279" height="68"></p>
      </center>
      <p>This will provide the temperature required within statistical
        probabilities. A statistical probability deals with the least
        significant digit (LSD) of each variable. In the case of phonon
        resonance, this is limited to the density. For example, the
        density of Ag is 10.50 gm/cm3. Taking that the accuracy is
        &amp;plusmn;1 LSD, we can establish a variable range by applying
        the following: </p>

      <p>Or, +/- 0.0009524 </p>
      <p>To place the mathematics in perspective, following is the
        calculations for the conversion of Ag107 to Au. </p>

        <p><img src="formula8.gif" width="310" height="161"></p>
      </center>
      <p>To find the most logical profile requires determining the basic
        phonon frequencies of all of the stable isotopes. </p>
      <center>
        <p><b><font size="+1">Conversion of Al to Au</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>The conversion of Al to Au is an absolute application of
        dimensional science. In this reaction, Au (gold) is produced in
        its ultra-pure state on a continuous basis. This procedure may
        be utilized for most elements. The basis of this dimensional
        occurs in the collection of atomic size particles that form near
        the resonant metal (in this case aluminum). Due to the size of
        the particles they appear in what normal chemistry would
        consider a gas phase. The targeted element (isotope) forms in
        its singular state and due to the lack of energies present.
        There are insufficient energies to bind the atoms into a
        colloidal state. This being the case, an apparatus similar to
        the following is required. </p>
      <p>In the production of gold from aluminum, the ideal temperature
        is 302.9 oC. These temperatures are optimum for the Al (the Al
        must be allowed to come into equilibrium with the furnace). Once
        resonance is established, production is continuous. The Au is
        captured in the water as it is removed from a negative pressure
        applied to the furnace established by the vacuum pump. However,
        please be aware that Al will also convert to Ag107 at a
        temperature of 283.7oC. To understand this, the following chart
        is supplied: </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="altemp.gif" width="374" height="382"></p>
      </center>
      As you can see, as the aluminum reaches the phonon resonance of Au
      it passes through the resonance of Ag. Due to the atomic spacing,
      Al will not form any other element near this temperature range.

      <p>At the time of printing the Phonon Conversion of Ag to Au, the

      <p>An interesting point, the above technology(s) is applied
        without knowledge as to why in the commercial mining field
        today. It is call roasting. However, to gain maximum yield from
        the reaction, one must utilize an apparatus similar to the one
        shown in Figure 2, "Phonon Conversion of Ag to Au --- a
        dimensional formation". </p>
      <p>Please note a significant point of interest. This procedure is
        nondescript. As easy as zinc, aluminum, titanium or silver
        converts into gold, so does gold convert into titanium and

        is 109.7 oF. If Au is present, it will appear as black specks
        floating in the nitric solution.&nbsp; The larger the quantity
        of black specs, the larger the quantity of gold that has

      <p><b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>[0003] The present invention relates to methods of mutation of
        yeast of the genus Sacchromyces with metallic silver. The mutant
        microbes carry out biological transmutation in coating silver
        with a trace amount of nano gold particles. The mutated microbes
        are useful in a number of applications including the recovery of
        precious metal values from mineral ores and the production of
        biofuels and oil products using both inorganic and organic
        matter as nutrient sources. </p>
      <p><b>BACKGROUND</b> </p>
      <p>[0004]<b> Biological Transmutation</b>. Biological
        transmutation can be defined as a nuclear transmutation
        occurring in living organisms. Generally, the phenomenon is not
        accepted by mainstream science, which argues that transmutations
        are only possible in high-energy nuclear reactions. Such
        reactions are physically impossible in biological systems, as
        the amount of energy used in such a manner would be fatal within
        a several-kilometer radius. Proponents respond that evidence
        shows that transmutations do occur, and that the lack of a
        theoretical model adequately explaining the mechanisms involved
        (that is, without the emission of deadly amounts of energy) does
        not render that evidence invalid. The most prominent defender of
        the existence of biological transmutations is the French
        scientist Corentin Louis Kervran, who investigated discrepancies
        between the dietary or environmental intake of elements such as
        calcium, potassium or magnesium by various organisms and the
        quantities they hold or excrete. For instance he investigated
        the source of calcium chickens use for their eggshells, and
        concluded that they probably convert the calcium from dietary
        potassium. </p>
      <p>[0005] Applicants have discovered mutant microbes obtained by
        treating microbes in aqueous solution with silver. The mutant
        microbes coat silver with a thin layer of a yellow material
        comprising a trace amount of nano gold particles by a biological
        transmutation process. Allotropic silver is yellow. But
        spectroscopic x-ray analysis and conventional metallurgical fire
        assay methods show the yellow material deposited on silver by
        the mutant microbes comprises trace amounts of nano gold
        particles. </p>
      <p>[0006] <b>Nanotechnology</b>. Nanoparticles are of great
        scientific interest as they are effectively a bridge between
        bulk materials and atomic or molecular structures. A bulk
        material should have constant physical properties regardless of
        its size, but at the nano-scale this is often not the case.
        Size-dependent properties are observed such as quantum
        confinement in semiconductor particles, surface plasma resonance
        in some metal particles and superparamagnetism in magnetic
        materials. </p>
      <p>[0007] The properties of materials change as their size
        approaches the nanoscale and as the percentage of atoms at the
        surface of a material becomes significant. For bulk materials
        larger than one micrometer the percentage of atoms at the
        surface is minuscule relative to the total number of atoms of
        the material. The interesting and sometimes unexpected
        properties of nanoparticles are not partly due to the aspects of
        the surface of the material dominating the properties in lieu of
        the bulk properties. </p>
      <p>[0008] Nanoparticles exhibit a number of special properties
        relative to bulk material. For example, the bending of bulk
        copper (wire, ribbon, etc.) occurs with movement of copper
        atoms/clusters at about the 50 nm scale. Copper nanoparticles
        smaller than 50 nm are considered super hard materials that do
        not exhibit the same malleability and ductility as bulk copper.
        The change in properties is not always desirable. Ferroelectric
        materials smaller than 10 nm can switch their magnetization
        direction using room temperature thermal energy, thus making
        them useless for memory storage. Suspensions of nanoparticles
        are possible because the interaction of the particle surface
        with the solvent is strong enough to overcome differences in
        density, which usually result in a material either sinking or
        floating in a liquid. Nanoparticles often have unexpected
        visible properties because they are small enough to confine
        their electrons and produce quantum effects. For example gold
        nanoparticles appear deep red to black in solution. </p>

      <p>[0010] Microbes for Precious Metal Recovery. The uses of
        microbes for recovering precious metals from mineral ores are
        known. Precious metals are frequently occluded, encapsulated,
        bonded and/or alloyed in mineral ores and are not amendable to
        conventional recovery methods. For example, gold often occurs as
        finely disseminated sub-microscopic particles within a
        refractory sulfide host of pyrite or arsenopyrite. Bio-oxidation
        is used to liberate the gold occluded within the sulfide host. A
        number of processes for bio-oxidizing the sulfide minerals are
        known in the art. One known method of bio-oxidizing the metal
        sulfides in an ore is to use bacteria, such as Thiobacillus
        ferrooxidans, sulfolobus, acidianus species and
        facultative-thermophilic bacteria in a microbial pretreatment. </p>
      <p>[0011] Applicants have discovered that the mutant microbes are
        useful for recovering precious metals from mineral ores and the
        biomass of dead mutant microbes of the invention. </p>
      <p>[0012] <b>Microbes for Biofuel Production</b>. The use of
        microorganisms to produce methane and ethanol from organic
        matter are known in the art. For example, ethanol for use as
        fuel and in alcoholic beverages is produced by fermentation of
        sugar by certain species of yeast (most importantly,
        Saccharomyces cerevisiae). </p>
      <p>[0013] Applicants have discovered that the mutant microbes of
        this invention are useful for production of biofuels and oil
        products from sedimentary organic matter and biomass, including

      <p><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b> </p>
      <p>[0026] Microbes are well known, commercially available and
        widely used in industrial microbiology. According to one
        embodiment, the microbes used herein are single-celled and
        non-pathogenic. Known industrial microbes include the genus of
        Saccharomyces and Schizosaccharomyces. Preferred species of
        Sacchromyces include the species: S. cerevisiae, S. bayanus, S.
        boulardii, S. pastorianus, S. uvarum, S. carlsbergensis, S.
        ellisoidesu, S. exiguus, S. fragilis, S. chevalieri, S. chodati,
        S. diastaticus and S. rouxii. Preferred species of
        Schizosaccharomyces is Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Other commonly
        known and industrial microbes that can be used include
        Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus orzae, Ashbya gossypii,
        Streptomyces species, Bacillus thuringiensis, Rhizobium,
        Bradyrhizobium, Bacillus subtilis, Corynebacterium glutamicum,
        Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Streptodornase pyogenes, and
        Thiobacillus ferrooxidans. The genus Saccharomyces is the
        preferred fungi for use in this invention. The preferred species
        are S. cerevisiae and S. carlsbergensis. These yeasts are
        commercially available. </p>
      <p>[0027] In the embodiments described, natural microbes, such as
        those present in alkali flat lake bed deposits in Franklin Lake
        or Alkali Flat in Inyo County, Calif., can be used. Other
        natural bacteria are dormant bacteria in dried lakebeds and
        seabeds such as the Great Salt Lake deposits of Utah and the
        Winnemucca Lake deposits of Nevada. </p>
      <p>[0028] In an exemplary embodiment, the microbes are mutated
        from industrial microbes and natural ancient microbes in mineral
        ores by a process that includes contacting the microbe(s) in an
        aqueous solution with metallic silver. The metallic silver can
        be particles, grains, granules, and/or bars, ranging in size
        from 1 micron particles to silver bars of 10 kilograms or more.
        Colloidal silver solutions with colloidal silver in aqueous
        solution ranging in concentration from 1 ppm to 10 ppm and
        particle sizes from 1 nanometer to 1 micron can be used. In one
        embodiment, metallic silver of 1 micron or more in size to
        silver bars of 10 kilogram or more is used. The contacting can
        be done without agitation, but preferably with mechanical
        agitation, air agitation (pumping air or oxygen into the aqueous
        solution) and/or pumping and passing the microbe in an aqueous
        nutrient solution through columns, tubes and tanks containing
        metallic silver. The mutation may be performed at temperatures
        ranging from 20 degrees centigrade to 90 degrees centigrade,
        preferably at temperatures ranging from 30 degrees centigrade to
        50 degrees centigrade. </p>
      <p>[0029] The aqueous solution may contain sufficient nutrients to
        support microbial growth. The useful nutrients are both
        inorganic and organic compounds commonly used to grow and
        nourish microbes. Inorganic nutrients include nitric acid,
        ammonium nitrate, ammonium chloride, ammonium sulfate, sodium
        nitrate, sulfur, sodium sulfide, sodium chloride, sodium
        bicarbonate, sodium phosphate, potassium phosphate, ferric
        chloride, calcium chloride, and ammonium phosphate. Organic
        nutrients include microbial biomass, glucose, dextrose, sodium
        acetate, amino acids, and purines. Microbial biomass may be dead
        microbes being used for mutation. Vitamins that can be included
        in the nutrient solution include pyridoxine, pyridoxamine-HCl,
        riboflavin, thiamine, niacin, pantothenic acid, p-aminobenzoic
        acid, folic acid, and biotin. Very small amounts of trace
        elements such as iron, copper, molybdenum and zinc can also be
        provided in the nutrient solution. Useful nutrients can also be
        mineral ores used for recovery of metals and sedimentary organic
        matter and rocks used for liberation of oil products. </p>
      <p>[0030] In one embodiment, the mutation process is performed in
        an aqueous solution and the biomass from dead microbes is used
        as nutrients until the mutant microbes reach a density of 1% or
        more. Pressure is not critical and can be atmospheric, below
        atmospheric and/or above atmospheric. </p>
      <p>[0031] The mutation can be conducted in aerobic or anaerobic
        conditions. However, the mutation is preferably conducted in the
        presence of nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and oxygen in the
        atmosphere. Oxygen can be provided chemically, for example, with
        hydrogen peroxide, or as a gas from pressurized vessels. </p>
      <p>[0032] The mutant microbes may be single-celled or multi-celled
        microbes. They are usually round, but can be oval, elongated or
        flattened on one side. They have also been observed to be
        rod-shaped bacillus. They range in size from 0.20 to 2.0 micron
        in diameter and 2 to 8 micron in length. They have been observed
        to divide by budding and binary cell division. </p>
      <p>[0033] Once created, the mutant microbes are stored and
        maintained by conventional microbiology techniques. A healthy
        mutant microbe can be isolated and grown to microbe colonies of
        1% to 5% by weight in nutrient solutions. Nutrients can be
        inorganic, including nitric acid, ammonium nitrate, ammonium
        chloride, ammonium sulfate, sulfur, sodium sulfide, sodium
        nitrate, sodium chloride, sodium bicarbonate, sodium phosphate,
        potassium phosphate, ferric chloride, calcium chloride, and
        ammonium phosphate, and organic, including microbial biomass,
        glucose, dextrose, sodium acetate, amino acids, and purines. </p>
      <p>[0034] Vitamins that can be included in the nutrient solution
        include pyridoxine, pyridoxamine-HCl, riboflavin, thiamine,
        niacin, pantothenic acid, p-aminobenzoic acid, folic acid, and
        biotin. Microbial biomass may be dead microbes being used for
        mutation. Very small amounts of trace elements such as iron,
        copper, molybdenum and zinc can also be provided in the nutrient
        solution. When it is desirable to grow the mutant microbes on a
        solid medium, a solidifying agent such as agar (a complex
        polysaccharide derived from a marine alga) is added to the
        media. </p>
      <p>[0035] <b>Silver and Ultraviolet Germicidal Irradiation</b>.
        Alternatively or in addition, microbes can be mutated by
        ultraviolet germicidal irradiation and by a combination of
        metallic silver and UV irradiation. Ultraviolet (UV) light is
        electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths shorter than visible
        light. Ultraviolet can be separated into various ranges, with
        near range (less than 280 nm/2800 Angstrom) considered
        "germicidal UV". In one embodiment, UV in the range of 280 nm to
        390 nm is used to expose microbes. Forced flow of air or water
        can be used to agitate the microbial solution to ensure exposure
        to the UV radiation. The mutation using UV light may be done at
        temperatures ranging from 20 degrees centigrade to 80 degrees
        centigrade, and preferably at temperatures ranging from 30
        degrees centigrade to 50 degrees centigrade. In one embodiment,
        the UV irradiation and the silver germicidal mutation process
        are done together. </p>
      <p>[0036] <b>Silver and Electromagnetic Field</b>. In another
        embodiment, microbes can be mutated by conducting the mutation
        process in an electromagnetic field. For example, the mutation
        process can be conducted in a bioreactor with means to provide
        an electromagnetic field. The electromagnetic field can be
        provided by wrapping the bioreactor, such as a beaker, with
        copper wire and running an AC current of about 5 to 10 amps
        through the copper wire. In large bioreactors, for example,
        1,000 liters to 10,000 liters, the microbial solution can be
        pumped through a glass column wrapped with copper wire for
        current flow. The current can be provided with a variable
        transformer. </p>
      <p>[0037] <b>Carbon and Iron Arcs</b>. In another embodiment, the
        mutation process is conducted in a bioreactor equipped with
        carbon or iron arcs. The arcs can be provided with means for
        generating a voltage of about 5 to 10 volts between the carbon
        or iron arcs. </p>
      <p>[0038] The mutant microbes that are mutated by the methods
        described have been observed to contain clusters of precious
        metal atoms within the cytoplasm of the cell. The metals within
        the cytoplasm are observed as clusters, curved bands and
        circular rings of metal atoms. Some mutated microbes have sets
        of two to ten concentric rings. Using an electron scanning
        microscope, the clusters, bands, and concentric rings of metal
        atoms within the cellular structure have been identified as
        silver and gold atoms and particles. </p>
      <p>[0039] The mutant microbes can be identified and characterized
        by their ability to coat silver granules with a coating of a
        trace amount of nano gold particles. The coating process is done
        by contacting an aqueous solution of the mutant microbes with
        metallic silver. The amount of coating onto the silver ranges
        from 500 ppm to 1000 ppm and is dependent on the contact time,
        contact temperature and density of the microbial solution. The
        temperature ranges from 20 C to 90 C. The contact time ranges
        from one hour to 100 hours. With a high microbial density of 3
        to 5% by weight, the contact time is about 1 to 4 hours. The
        amount of nano gold particles in the coating is approximately
        100 ppm to 200 ppm based on X-ray diffraction analysis and
        scanning electron microscope analysis. </p>
      <p>[0040] <b>Mineral Ores</b>. For purposes of this disclosure,
        the term "mineral" or "mineral ore" means a composition that
        comprises precious metal values. Thus, a mineral may be a mined
        mineral, ancient seabed deposit, ancient lakebed deposit, black
        sands, an ore concentrate, metal bearing sea water, and waste
        products, such as mining tails, industrial waste water, oil well
        brine, coal tars, oil shales, tar sands, and oil sands. Useful
        minerals contain trace amounts of precious metals. Trace amount
        means the detection limit or below detection limits of
        conventional assay procedures such as fire assay, AAS (atomic
        adsorption spectroscopy), ICP-MS (inductive coupled plasma-mass
        spectrometer), ICP-AES (atomic emission spectroscopy) and other
        spectroscopic instrumentation commonly used in analytical
        laboratories. Some spectroscopic methods can detect as little as
        1 ppt (part per trillion) to 0.1 ppb (part per billion).
        Preferred mineral ores have from about 1 ppb to 100 ppm of
        precious metals. </p>
      <p>[0041] <b>Digestion and Metal Recovery</b>. In one embodiment,
        the digestion and biotreatment of the mutant microbes with the
        mineral ores are conducted in commercially available bioreactors
        consisting of a reactor having an agitation means. The agitation
        means can be mechanical stirring with a flat bladed impeller,
        percolation column, or air agitated pachuca reactor. The
        bioreactor can have air intake means, sterilization means,
        harvesting means, heating and/or cooling means, temperature
        controller means, pH controller means, filtration means and
        pressure controller means. All these features of bioreactors are
        known and commercially available in the biotechnology industry.
      </p>
      <p>[0042] The digestion of the mineral ores by the mutant microbes
        can also be done by heap leaching techniques. In heap bio
        leaching techniques, a large body of mineral ore is treated with
        mutant microbes in nutrient solution in large contaminant ponds
        with no agitation and/or only occasional agitation. Generally,
        the contact time for heap type bio treatment is substantially
        longer than the agitated bioreactors, and range from 10 days to
        100 days. </p>
      <p>[0043] The mineral ore can be milled and ground to 10 mesh to
        300 mesh, preferably 100 to 200 mesh. The minerals useful in the
        invention are low grade and high grade precious metal minerals.
        Low grade minerals contain from 1 ppb to 1 ppm of a precious
        metal, preferably gold and silver. High grade minerals contain
        from 2 ppm to 100 ppm. Bio treatment temperature ranges from 15
        degrees centigrade to 50 degrees centigrade, preferably from 20
        degrees to 30 degrees centigrade. pH can be acidic (pH 1 to 3)
        or basic (pH 9 to 12), although slightly acidic (pH 4) to
        slightly basic (pH 8) pH ranges are preferred. The most
        preferred pH ranges are the neutral range of from pH 6.5 to pH
        7.5. </p>
      <p>[0044] Microbe concentration is not critical. At low microbe
        concentration, the contact duration is generally longer to allow
        the microbe to grow and multiply. However, microbe concentration
        should not exceed the maximum microbe concentration that the
        nutrient solution can sustain. Contact time can vary from a few
        hours to several weeks and depends in part on the type and mesh
        size of the mineral ore digested. Contact time ranges can be
        from 1 day to 30 days, more preferably from 1 day to 10 days.
        The ratio of mineral ore to nutrient solution is also not
        critical. Generally for ease of agitation, the ratio of mineral
        ore to microbe/nutrient solution, hereinafter, also referred as
        the pulp density, varies from 10% by weight mineral ore in the
        nutrient solution to 50% by weight mineral ore in the nutrient
        solution. </p>
      <p>[0045] The digestion can be conducted in aerobic or anaerobic
        conditions. However, the mutation is preferably conducted in the
        presence of oxygen, nitrogen and carbon dioxide in the
        atmosphere. Oxygen can also be provided chemically, for example,
        with hydrogen peroxide, or as a gas from pressurized vessels. </p>
      <p>[0046] Nutrients can also be provided in the digestion of
        mineral ore to support growth of the mutant microbes. Nutrients
        can be inorganic, including nitric acid, sulfur, ammonium
        nitrate, ammonium chloride, ammonium sulfate, sodium nitrate,
        sodium chloride, sodium bicarbonate, sodium phosphate, potassium
        nitrate, potassium phosphate, ferric chloride, calcium chloride,
        and ammonium phosphate, and organic, including glucose,
        dextrose, sodium acetate, amino acids, and purines. Vitamins
        that can be included in the nutrient solution include
        pyridoxine, pyridoxamine-HCl, riboflavin, thiamine, niacin,
        pantothenic acid, p-aminobenzoic acid, folic acid, and biotin.
        Very small amounts of traces elements such as iron, copper,
        molybdenum and zinc can also be provided in the nutrient
        solution. </p>
      <p>[0047] Nutrients can be added to the digestion as needed to
        maintain the sufficient mutant microbes for microbial growth and
        metal liberation. Microbial growth can be measured by
        conventional direct methods such as plate count, serial
        dilution, pour plates, spread plates and direct microscope
        count. Microbial growth can also be measured by indirect methods
        such as turbidity and metabolic activity. </p>
      <p>[0048] After digestion with the mutant microbes, the recovery
        of metal from the mineral ore and microbial solution can be
        performed by conventional metallurgical methods such as
        smelting, leaching, electrolysis, resins and other methods known
        to those skilled in art of metallurgy. In another embodiment,
        the precious metals in the mutant microbes or biomass of dead
        mutant microbes can be recovered by methods described for
        recovery of precious metals from mineral ore. </p>
      <p>[0049] <b>Sedimentary Organic Matter and Rocks</b>. According
        to other exemplary embodiments, the mutant microbes are used for
        producing oil products and biofuels from a sedimentary organic
        matter and rock. Suitable sedimentary organic matter includes
        coal, bituminous coal, sub-bituminous coal, lignite, bitumen,
        coal tar, fly ash, shale, tar sands and oil sands. Sedimentary
        organic matter that contains a high content of sulfur and
        sulfides can be used. Oil shale is found in the Western United
        States, especially the states of Utah, Wyoming, and Colorado,
        and oil sands found in northern Alberta, Canada. Oil shale is a
        general term applied to a group of rocks rich enough in organic
        matter (called kerogen) to yield oil products upon distillation.
        Oil sands, also referred to as tar sands or bituminous sands,
        are a combination of clay, sand, water and bitumen. Sedimentary
        organic matter and rocks generally contain from 1% to 99%
        organic matter, preferably 10 to 90% organic matter. </p>
      <p>[0050] <b>Biomass</b>. According to other exemplary
        embodiments, the mutant microbes are used for producing oil
        products and biofuels from biomass. Biomass is any recently
        living organisms or their metabolic by products. Biomass can be
        of plant or animal origin. Useful biomass include agricultural
        residues such as rice straw, stover, wheat straw; agricultural
        wastes such sugarcane bagasse, rice hulls, corn fiber, sugar
        beet pulp, citrus pulp, citrus peels; forestry wastes such as
        hardwood and softwood thinning and hardwood and softwood
        residues from timber operations; and wood wastes such as saw
        mill waste and pulp and paper mill waste; urban wastes such as
        paper fraction of municipal solid waste; urban wood waste and
        urban green waste, and dedicated crops such as switchgrass,
        hybrid poplar wood, grains, maiden grass. Simple sugars or
        monosaccharides, such as glucose, fructose, and dextrose can
        also be used. Preferred biomass feed stocks are plant cellulosic
        biomass -- that is, biomass composed primarily of inedible plant
        fibers having cellulose and hemicellulose as a prominent
        component. The biofuel produced depends on the biomass
        feedstock, and include methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanol,
        mixed alcohols, biogases. In biorefining and bioconverting
        embodiments, the mutant microbes are used to convert, refine and
        degrade heavy oils, bitumen, asphalt and tar to lower molecular
        weight and density petroleum products. </p>
      <p>[0051] <b>Heavy Oil and Enhanced Oil Recovery</b>. A preferred
        form of biomass is heavy oil. The mutant microbes can be used
        for bioconversion, biorefining and biodegradation of heavy oil
        that is too viscous to ship through a pipeline to lighter oil
        that can be shipped in pipelines. Examples are surface heavy oil
        deposits, heavy oil recovered from oil sands and oil shale and
        heavy oil in oil wells and in depleted and abandoned oil wells.
        The mutant microbes can be injected in the oil wells with water
        and/or steam commonly used for secondary and enhanced oil
        recovery. Once the heavy oil is biodegraded to oil of a lower
        viscosity, it can be pumped from the oil well and transported in
        pipelines. The microbes can also be used to bioconvert surface
        heavy oil deposits to lighter oil products that can also be
        shipped in pipelines. [0052] Biorefining, bioconversion and
        biodegrading methods. The digestion and biotreatment of the
        mutant microbes with biomass, heavy oil and sedimentary organic
        matter is conducted in commercially available bioreactors
        consisting of a reactor having an agitation means. The agitation
        means can be mechanical stirring with a flat bladed impeller,
        percolation column, air agitated Pachuca reactors, and
        continuous flow stirred tank reactors. The bioreactor can have
        air intake means, sterilization means, harvesting means, heating
        and/or cooling means, temperature controller means, pH
        controller means, filtration means and pressure controller
        means. All these features of bioreactors are known and
        commercially available in the biotechnology, biorefining and
        biomining industry. The digestion the biomass and sedimentary
        organic matter by the mutant microbes can also be done by heap
        leaching techniques. In heap bio leaching techniques, a large
        body of mineral ore is placed in a heap or dump where is it
        irrigated and treated with mutant microbes. Generally, the
        contact time for heap type bio treatment is substantially longer
        than the agitated bioreactors, and range from 10 days to 100
        days. </p>
      <p>[0053] The biomass and sedimentary organic matter can be milled
        and ground to particles in the range of 10 mesh to 300 mesh,
        preferably 100 to 200 mesh. </p>
      <p>[0054] Bio treatment temperature ranges from 15 degrees
        centigrade to 90 degrees centigrade, and preferably range from
        20 degrees to 50 degrees centigrade. pH can be acidic (pH 1 to
        3) or basic (pH 9 to 12), although slightly acidic (pH 4) to
        slightly basic (pH 8) pH ranges are preferred. The most
        preferred pH ranges are the neutral range of from pH 6.5 to pH
        7.5. </p>
      <p>[0055] Microbe concentration is not critical. At low microbe
        concentration, the contact duration is generally longer to allow
        the microbe to grow and multiply. However, microbe concentration
        should not exceed the maximum microbe concentration that the
        nutrients can sustain. </p>
      <p>[0056] Contact time can vary from a few hours to several weeks
        and depends in part on the type and mesh size of the biomass and
        sedimentary organic matter digested. Contact time ranges can be
        from 1 day to 30 days, more preferably from 1 day to 10 days. </p>
      <p>[0057] The ratio of biomass and sedimentary organic matter to
        microbial solution is also not critical. Generally for ease of
        agitation in stirred-tanks, the ratio of biomass or sedimentary
        organic matter to microbe solution varies from 10% by weight
        mineral ore in the microbial solution to 50% by weight mineral
        ore in the microbial solution, and preferably about 15% by
        weight to 25% by weight. The digestion can be conducted in
        aerobic or anaerobic conditions. However, the mutation is
        preferably conducted in the presence of oxygen, nitrogen and
        carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Oxygen can also be provided
        chemically, for example, with hydrogen peroxide, or as a gas
        from pressurized vessels. </p>
      <p>[0058] Nutrients can also be provided in the digestion of
        biomass, heavy oil or sedimentary organic matter to support
        growth of the mutant microbes. Nutrients can be inorganic and/or
        organic. </p>
      <p>[0059] Suitable media for growing mutant microbes and producing
        precious metals are nutrient media containing 1 to 10% by weight
        nitric acid. Vitamins that can be included in the nutrient
        solution include pyridoxine, pyridoxamine-HCl, riboflavin,
        thiamine, niacin, pantothenic acid, p-aminobenzoic acid, folic
        acid, and biotin. Very small amounts of traces elements such as
        iron, copper, molybdenum and zinc can also be provided in the
        nutrient solution. The biomass and organic matter present in
        sedimentary organic matter also serve as nutrients. </p>
      <p>[0060] Nutrients can be added to the digestion as needed to
        maintain the sufficient mutant microbes for microbial growth.
        Microbial growth can be measured by conventional direct methods
        such as plate count, serial dilution, pour plates, spread plates
        and direct microscope count. Microbial growth can also be
        measured by indirect methods such as turbidity and metabolic
        activity. </p>
      <p>[0061] <b>Metals and Biofuels Co-Production</b>. With
        sedimentary organic matter and fossil fuels containing precious
        and base metals, both metals and gaseous and liquid petroleum
        and metals are liberated and produced by the mutant microbes.
        After bio treatment, petroleum products are recovered and
        refined by conventional petroleum processes and the precious and
        base metals are recovered by conventional precious metal
        beneficiation processes such as electrowinning and/or
        dcyanidation. In one embodiment the mutant microbes are used to
        treat a mixture of a metal mineral ore and sedimentary organic
        matter and/or a fossil fuel. In this embodiment, the liquid oil
        products released from the sedimentary organic matter captures
        and floats the metals released from the metal mineral ore by a
        process similar to flotation or froth flotation processes used
        in the mining industry. The bio treatment procedures used for
        bio-energy and bio-fuel production are the same as the bio
        treatment and digestion procedures used for liberation of metals
        and are known industrial bio tech processing procedures. </p>
      <p>[0062] <b>Electromagnetic Field, Carbon Arcs and Iron Arcs</b>.
        In other embodiments, the biotreatment of minerals ores,
        sedimentiary organic matter and biomass can be conducted in
        bioreactors equipped with an electromagnetic field, an
        electromagnetic field and carbon arcs and an electromagnetic
        field and iron arcs. </p>
      <p>[0063] Fire assaying and cupellation are described by C. W.

      <p><b>EXAMPLES</b> </p>
      <p>[0064] The above embodiments and other objects, features and
        advantages of this invention will become apparent to those
        skilled in the art from the following examples and descriptions
        of the embodiments. The examples are presented to one of
        ordinary skill in the art to make and use the invention and are
        provided in the context of a patent application and its
        requirements. Various modifications to the preferred embodiments
        and the generic principles and features described herein will be
        readily apparent to those skilled in the art. Thus, the present
        invention is not intended to be limited to the embodiments
        shown, but is to be accorded the widest scope and consistent
        with the principles and features described herein. </p>
      <p><b>Mutation Examples</b> </p>
      <p><b>Example 1</b> <br>
        <b>Silver Mutation Method</b> </p>
      <p>[0065] A Petri dish containing 2 grams of silver granules, 4
        grams of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and 10 ml of distilled water
        were stirred occasionally over a ten day period. A small sample
        of aqueous solution was then placed on a glass slide with cover.
        The slide was then examined under a Meiji binocular biological
        optical microscope. Live microbes could be observed with a dense
        band of metal atoms within its cellular structure at
        magnifications as low as 500.times.. Some of the live microbes
        were then examined with a LEO electron scanning microscope (SEM)
        at 10,000.times. and 20,000.times. magnifications. Clear bands
        of metal atoms in concentric rings could be observed. Using an
        EDAX x-ray spectrometer, the metal bands were determined to be
        metallic. </p>
      <p>[0066] FIG. 1 and FIG. 2 are images of the mutant microbes
        viewed with the SEM. The SEM used was a Leo model 1430VP with
        tungsten filaments and an Edax 10 millimeter sapphire x-ray
        diffraction detector. The optical microscope used is Mieji
        lightfield model number 5500 with an Infinity 1100 camera. </p>
      <p><b>Example 2</b> <br>
        <b>Silver Method</b> </p>
      <p>[0067] A 200 gallon tank reactor about 2 feet wide, 2 feet deep
        and 8 feet long was filled with about 600 liters of well water
        containing trace amounts of naturally occurring minerals. Three
        kilograms of silver granules prepared by melting a 99.9 purity
        silver bars in a gas furnace and pouring onto a stainless steel
        60 mesh screen placed over a stainless steel drum filled with
        water. The silver was placed in a 6 cm diameter clear plastic
        percolation column. Three kilograms of commercially manufactured
        S. Cerevisiae was added to the tank. The tank reactor was heated
        to about 40 degrees centigrade with an immersion stainless
        heater and the aqueous solution was pumped to the top of the
        percolation column with a submersible pump at the rate of about
        40 liters per minute. </p>
      <p>[0068] The S. Cerevisiae was allowed to mutate for a period of
        about 30 days until the population density of mutated microbes
        reached about 3% to 5% by weight. The mutant microbes in the
        tank reactor were observed under the SEM to have concentric
        rings of metal within the cellular structure. Under the optical
        microscope the mutant microbes appeared rod shaped with a
        flatten bottom on one side. The size was about 1 to 10 micron.
        After the Sacchromyces had completely mutated and/or died, about
        500 grams cane sugar was added as nutrient for the mutant
        microbes. </p>
      <p>[0069] After about 30 days, a 10 gram sample of the microbial
        solution was dried in a desiccator with a vacuum pump for 18
        hours. The residue in the desiccator weighed 0.5 grams. A ten
        gram sample of silver granules coated with the yellow metal was
        heated in a kiln at about 320 C. After one hour, the yellow
        metal had vaporized and the silver no longer had a yellow color.
        The silver granules were then cooled and weighed. After heating,
        the weight of silver granules decreased in weight by 6 mg. Based
        on this test, the maximum amount of yellow metal was in the
        range of 6 parts in 10,000 parts. </p>
      <p>[0070] A 48 gram sample of silver granules coated with the
        yellow metal was placed in an Erlenmeyer flask and with 100 ml
        of 1 N nitric acid solution. The flask was heated on a hot plate
        until the nitric acid solution reached about 60 C. After about
        30 minutes, a small amount of grey-black material was observed
        in the nitric acid solution and the silver granules no longer
        had a yellow color. The nitric acid was decanted from the silver
        granules and filtered onto a filter paper circle placed on
        sinister glass filtration unit under vacuum. The silver granules
        in the Erlenmeyer flask after decanting the nitric acid solution
        was dried and found to weigh 47.9 grams. The nitric acid
        solution was saved for processing as described below. </p>
      <p>[0071] The filter paper and the grey-black material were washed
        with distilled water and placed on about 9 grams of a lead
        sheet, dried, folded and placed into a bone ash cupel. The cupel
        was heated at 1800 F for about 30 minutes. On cooling, the cupel
        had a pale yellow bead weighing about 3 milligrams. The yellow
        bead was examined on a scanning electron microscope. The
        spectrum showed silver and gold peaks. </p>
      <p>[0072] The fire assaying and cupellation methods used above are
        standard metallurgical methods for precious metals. Fire
        assaying and cupellation are described by C. W. Ammen, Recovery
        and Refining of Precious Metals, second edition 1993, Chapter
        12, pp 302-329. </p>
      <p>[0073] <b>Crooks Process</b>. The nitric acid
        solution/filtrate was placed in a beaker and heated to dryness
        at 200 C. A white and gray residue was formed in the bottom of
        the beaker. The beaker was then heated to about 280 C until the
        white crystals melted to a clear liquid. Distilled water was
        then added. The grey material which did not dissolve in the
        water was filtered onto a filter paper circle placed on sinister
        glass filtration unit under vacuum. The filter paper and grey
        material were washed with distilled water and placed on about 10
        grams of a lead sheet, dried, folded and heated and placed into
        a bone ash cupel. The cupel was heated at 1800 F for about 30
        minutes. On cooling, the cupel had a pale yellow bead weighing
        about 3 milligrams. The yellow bead was examined on a scanning
        electron microscope. The spectrum showed silver and gold peaks.
      </p>
      <p>[0074] A silver granule coated with yellow material produced by
        the method of Example 2 was examined with a scanning electron
        microscope. The spectrum showed a major peak for gold, as is
        shown in FIG. 3. </p>
      <p><b>Example 3</b> <br>
        <b>Silver and UV Mutation</b> </p>
      <p>[0075] A 37 liter glass tank was filled with 12 liters
        distilled water, 100 grams of 100 micron to 1 millimeter silver
        particles, 500 grams of dry active Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The
        tank was maintained at about 25 degrees centigrade and agitated
        with a small fish aquarium pump and an air stone. The tank was
        exposed to an ultraviolet mercury lamp of 50 watts. After about
        five to nine days the microbe density was about 3 to 4% by
        weight. </p>
      <p>[0076] The mutant microbes were analyzed with an Induced
        Coupling Plasma-Mass Spectrometer. Small amounts of silver and
        gold are detected. </p>
      <p><b>Example 4</b> <br>
        <b>Silver Mutation</b> </p>
      <p>[0077] A 37 liter glass tank was filled with 12 liters
        distilled water, 100 grams of 100 micron to 1 millimeter silver
        particles, 1400 grams of the wet form of Saccharomyces
        cerevisiae. The tank was maintained at about 39 degrees
        centigrade and agitated with a fish aquarium air pump and an air
        stone. After about 5 days the microbe density was about 3 to 4%
        by weight and the silver granules were coated with a thin layer
        of a yellow material. </p>
      <p><b>Example 5</b> <br>
        <b>Silver Mutation In Salt Water</b> </p>
      <p>[0078] A 37 liter glass tank was filled with 12 liters
        distilled water, 100 grams of 100 micron to 1 millimeter silver
        particles, 1400 grams of the wet form of Saccharomyces
        cerevisiae and 12 grams of sea salt. The tank was maintained at
        about 39 degrees centigrade and agitated with a fish aquarium
        air pump and an air stone. After about 7 days the microbe
        density was about 3 to 4% by weight and the silver granules were
        coated with a thin layer of a yellow material. The microbes were
        moderately active. </p>
      <p>[0079] A one liter solution of the microbial solution prepared
        in Example 5 was heated to 95 C on a hot plate. After two days,
        the microbial density of the microbial solution was about 3 to
        4% by weight and the mutant microbes were moderately active. </p>
      <p><b>Example 6</b> <br>
        <b>Mutation In Electromagnetic Field</b> </p>
      <p>[0080] A 2-liter beaker was tightly wrapped with 125 feet of 14
        gauge insulated copper wire. The ends of the wire were connected
        to an extension cord and plugged into a Superior Electric
        variable transformer. The beaker was filled with 100 grams of
        99.9% casting silver granules of 1 mm to 10 mm, 100 grams of
        Saccharomyces cerevisiae and 1000 ml of distilled water.
        Transformer was adjusted for 7 to 7.5 amps of current through
        the copper wire to create a magnetic field in the beaker. The
        temperature of the microbial solution varied from about 35 C to
        39 C. An air pump and air stone was used to agitate and to
        provide air to the microbial solution. Distilled water was added
        as needed to maintain the microbial solution at about 1000 ml.
        After about five days, the microbe density was in the range of
        1% to 3% by weight and the silver granules were coated with a
        thin layer of a yellow material. </p>
      <p><b>Example 7</b> <br>
        <b>Mutation In Electromagnetic Field and Carbon Arc</b> </p>
      <p>[0081] A beaker wrapped with copper wire as described in
        Example 6 was equipped with two 3/8 inch diameter by 12 inch
        long carbon rods. The carbon rods were wired to an extension
        cord and plugged into a Superior Electric variable transformer.
        The beaker was filled with 100 grams of 99.9% casting silver
        granules of 1 mm to 10 mm, 100 grams of Saccharomyces cerevisiae
        and 1000 ml of distilled water. The transformer was adjusted for
        7 to 7.5 amps current through the copper wire to create a
        magnetic field in the beaker. The second transformer was
        adjusted to provide about 10 volts to the carbon arcs. The
        temperature of the microbial solution varied from about 40 C to
        45 C. An air pump and air stone was used to agitate and to
        provide air to the microbial solution. After about 5 days, the
        microbe density was in the range of 1% to 3% by weight and the
        silver granules were coated with a thin layer of a yellow
        material. </p>
      <p><b>Example 8</b> <br>
        <b>Mutation In Electromagnetic Field and Iron Arc</b> </p>
      <p>[0082] A beaker wrapped with copper wire as described in
        Example 6 was equipped with two 3/8 inch by 18 inch iron rods.
        The iron rods were wired to an extension cord and plugged into a
        Superior Electric variable transformer. The beaker was filled
        with 100 grams of 99.9% casting silver granules of 1 mm to 10
        mm, 100 grams of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and 1000 ml of
        distilled water. Transformer was adjusted for 7 to 7.5 amps
        current through the copper wire to create a magnetic field in
        the beaker. The second transformer was adjusted to provide about
        8 to 10 volts to the iron arcs. The temperature of the microbial
        solution varied from about 40 C to 45 C. An air pump and air
        stone was used to agitate and to provide air to the microbial
        solution. Distilled water was added as needed to maintain the
        microbial solution at about 1000 ml. After about five days, the
        microbe density was in the range of 1% to 3% by weight and the
        silver granules were coated with a thin layer of a yellow
        material. </p>

        BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
      </p>
      <p>It is well known that throughout the Universe, transmutation
        occurs through various forms of nuclear reactions.These
        reactions can be generated from natural interstellar radiation
        sources, normal decay of unstable isotopes, or synthetic
        production of new isotopes by irradiation of stable and unstable
        isotopes using high energy accelerators. It is also understood
        in science that there are no absolutes in the way a nuclear
        reaction can occur, for a probability factor always exists. It
        is also well known that, even though theoretical postulations
        have been established, until now there has been no experimental
        proof of how the elements were formed throughout the universe.
        It is certainly known that in geological deposits noble metals
        are associated with select minerals, the pry arty one being
        quartz.<br>
        <br>
        In the past, many attempts have been made to transmute one
        element to another, such as mercury to gold. Despite such
        research effort toward this end, ecconomically attractive
        processes have not, to date, been found which have made their
        way into the commercial world. Thus, the potential to take a
        radioactive isotope and render it non-radioactive; take a
        non-radioactive isotope and convert it to a radioactive isotope;
        or convert a stable isotope to a stable isotope of another
        element, has not been viable until now.<br>
        <br>
        Of course, it is well known that particle accelerators can cause
        select isotopes of certain elements to undergo a fission by the
        bombardment of neutral particles. This fission rate is a
        correlation of the thermal neutron cross section, in
        relationship with the speed and quantity of particles.<br>
        <br>
        It is the object of this method to cause a transmutation of a
        starting isotope of the selected element to transform into a
        element of less mass. An essential criteria of this method is
        that the starting isotope has a magnetic moment. If the starting
        isotope does not have a magnetic moment it will not be
        susceptible to this method.<br>
        <br>
        It is another object of this method to provide a means of
        transformation (transmutation) without the requirement of any
        radioactive stimulation to start the method.<br>
        <br>
        Other and additional objects of this method will become apparent
        from the following disclosure the claims appended hereto.<br>

        <span style="font-weight: bold;">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</span><br
          style="font-weight: bold;">
      </p>
      <p>This method is based upon the discovered ability to selectively
        manipulate predetermined isotopes in a process that causes the
        starting isotope to undergo a transmutation to an isotope of a
        lesser mass and atomic number. A requirement for this
        transmutation to occur is the starting isotope must have a
        magnetic moment, thus having nuclear magnetic resonance
        qualities. Another requirement is that the reaction requires a
        heat generator which can be obtained from an endothermic or
        exothermic reaction. It is also required to have a resonance
        generator. In the preferred embodiment of the method the
        resonance generator is SiO2, however other resonance generators
        can be substituted.In accordance with and fulfilling the above
        setforth requirements, this method takes advantage of the recent
        discovery that isotopes of elements having characteristic
        resonant components (magnetic moments), in a specified state,
        and has imposed upon them the heat generator and resonant
        generator, a transmutation will occur. This transmutation is
        preferably an alpha particle fission, but is not limited to this
        reaction, and even with the alpha particle fission there can
        also occur secondary and tertiary radioactive decays. For
        example:<br>
      </p>
      <p><img style=" width: 530px; height: 45px;" alt="" src="wo2.jpg"><br>
      </p>
      <p>In this transmutation, the mercury201 isotope's first
        transmutation is an alpha decay that ends with a platinum'97
        isotope.Platinum'97 is a natural radioactive isotope which
        undergoes decay through a beta emission to gold197. It is well
        known and accepted that gold has only one stable isotope in
        nature which is Au197.<br>
        <br>
        It has been discovered, and it is an important attribute of this
        method, that elements that have become radioactive by
        irradiation can be converted to isotopes of new elements that
        are no longer radioactive. To illustrate this point:<br>
      </p>
      <p><img style=" width: 534px; height: 45px;" alt="" src="wo3.jpg"><br>
      </p>
      <p> Cobalt60 is a radioactive isotope synthetically produced from
        Co59 by irradiating Co59 with neutrons. Cobalt has many
        industrial and biomedical uses, but it has a half life of 5.275
        years. Cobalt meets the requirements of this method for it has
        an established magnetic moment. As shown in the example above,
        if cobalt60 was processed to undergo an alpha decay it would be
        converted to manganese56, which is also. a radioactive isotope,
        but the half life of manganese56 is only 65 seconds.Manganeses
        undergoes a natural decay by beta emission to irony This
        particular isotope of iron is non-radioactive and is found in
        nature at an abundance of 0.28%.<br>
        <br>
        Many examples of conversion from radioactive isotopes exist and
        are applicable to this method.<br>

        <span style="font-weight: bold;">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE
          INVENTION</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      </p>
      <p>The method can be substantially started at any ambient
        temperature and pressure. The method has been carried out at
        pressures of atmospheric, subatmospheric, and superatmospheric
        and temperatures starting from ambient to temperatures as high
        as 15000C. Thus, the operating parameters of the method are a
        matter of choice on the part of the engineering process
        designer. It does appear, however, that there is an important
        relationship between the allotropic crystalline configurations
        of the molecular chemical compounds of the heat and resonance
        generators. It is also thought, that there is an important
        relationship between the magnetic properties of the susceptible
        transmutation isotopes. That is to say, the isotopes of the
        elements that have magnetic moments have properties that are
        unique to themselves. Because of this fact, the final chemical
        matrix will vary dependent upon the inter-relationship of
        resonance qualities of the elements (isotopes) within the total
        matrix.<br>
        <br>
        Also, there is an important relationship between the aggregate
        physical size of the chemical crystals and the metallic
        particles that make up the entire chemical matrix Thus, it can
        be said that for a given temperature there must be proper
        crystalline configuration of the chemical molecules, and proper
        aggregate size of the starting chemicals and elements, for
        transmutation to be achieved.<br>
        <br>
        As stated above, there is a characteristic resonance unique to
        the starting isotope to be transmuted. According to this method,
        it is preferred that the strongest resonant generation be
        established by the introduction of SiO2, generically known as
        quartz. This resonance is absorbed by the targeted isotope to be
        transmuted and the other isotopes within the chemical matrix
        that have like qualities. For example refer to the Table I where
        a correlation between certain of the isotopes can be seen.<br>

        <br>
        Table I shows the relationship of the nuclear magnetic resonance
        frequencies of the isotopes used in the preferred embodiments.<br>
        <br>
        There is a direct correlation between the starting magnetic
        resonance frequencies and the ending magnetic resonance
        frequencies in the production of precious metals. This
        relationship can be illustrated by the following Table II:<br>
      </p>

          src="wo6.jpg"><br>
      </p>
      <p>To simplify the relationship between the magnetic resonances of
        the starting chemical matrix and the ending transmuted precious
        metal isotopes, the following tables set forth the correlation.<br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Table III</span><br
          style="font-weight: bold;">

      </p>
      <p>The imposition of the characteristic resonant frequency as
        denoted in Tables III and IV, show a direct relationship between
        the resonant qualities of the starting chemical matrix and that
        of the ending precious metals. The resonance data of Tables III
        and IV, is exemplary of the two strongest characteristic
        resonant groups.<br>
        <br>
        The physical size of the chemical compounds and the metallic
        elements has a direct relationship to the efficiency of the
        overall method. It is preferred that all compounds and elements
        be reduced to a physical size less than 200 mesh (sieve size).
        Also, it is important to have a totally homogeneous mixture, for
        it is necessary for all of the compounds and elements to be in
        intimate contact with each other.<br>
        <br>
        Chemical compounds within the matrix can be substituted, such as
        replacement of all but the heat generator and the required
        starting isotopes to be transmuted, with a sulfide mineral that
        contains all of the qualities of the resonant generator.<br>
        <br>
        It is also possible to substitute for the heat generator
        specific gases under pressure. Such gases act in place of the
        heat generator compounds when added to the resonance generator
        and transmutive isotopes. Preferred examples of such gases are:<br>
        CO2 + H + N + 0<br>
      </p>
      <p style="font-weight: bold;">SPECIFIC EXAMPLES OF THE INVENTION<br>
      </p>
      <p>The following are specific examples of the practice of this
        method and will serve to illustrate it. These examples are not
        to be considered in any way as limiting the scope of this method
        but only as examplary of it. In these examples, chemicals and
        precentages are by weight unless specified to the contrary.<br>

        A 2.0 liter stainless steel container was utilized, in which the
        above compounds and elements were physically reduced in size to
        less than 200 mesh and thoroughly homogenized by physical
        mixing.<br>
        <br>
        Next, the container, with the prepared chemical matrix within,
        was placed in a fume hood and ignited. The average time for
        total ignition was approximately 200 seconds.<br>
        <br>
        After the thermal melt process, the residue was allowed to cool
        and then was removed from the original container. At this point,
        the reaction was complete and there was an observable presence

        In accordance with Example 1 a 2.0 liter stainless steel
        container was utilized, in which the above chemicals and

          style="font-weight: bold;">
        <br>
        [0003] The present invention relates to methods of mutation of
        yeast of the genus Saccharomyces with metallic silver and nano
        silver atoms. The mutant microbes carry out biological
        transmutation in coating silver with a yellow material
        comprising trace amounts of nano gold particles. The mutant
        microbes are useful in a number of applications including the
        production and recovery of precious metals from mineral ores and
        the production of biofuels and oil products using both inorganic
        and organic matter as nutrient sources. The mutant microbes and
        yeast of the genus Saccharomyces are also useful for aggregating
        and coalescing nano precious metal atoms into clusters of bulk
        precious metals where the nano atoms are produced by the
        resonance of an aluminum or a silver tube in an electromagnetic
        field.<br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">BACKGROUND</span><br
          style="font-weight: bold;">
        <br>
        [0004] Biological Transmutation. Biological transmutation can be
        defined as a nuclear transmutation occurring in living
        organisms. The phenomenon is not accepted by mainstream science,
        which argues that transmutations are only possible in
        high-energy nuclear reactions. Such reactions are physically
        impossible in biological systems, as the amount of energy used
        in such a manner would be fatal within a several-kilometer
        radius. Proponents respond that evidence shows that
        transmutations do occur, and that the lack of a theoretical
        model adequately explaining the mechanisms involved (that is,
        without the emission of deadly amounts of energy) does not
        render that evidence invalid. The most prominent defender of the
        existence of biological transmutations is the French scientist
        Corentin Louis Kervran, who investigated discrepancies between
        the dietary or environmental intake of elements such as calcium,
        potassium or magnesium by various organisms and the quantities
        they hold or excrete. For instance he investigated the source of
        calcium which chickens use for production of their eggshells,
        and concluded that they probably convert the calcium from
        dietary potassium.<br>
        <br>
        [0005] Applicants have discovered mutant microbes obtained by
        treating microbes in aqueous solution with silver and nano
        silver atoms. The mutant microbes coat metallic bulk silver with
        a thin layer of a yellow material comprising a trace amount of
        nano gold particles by a biological transmutation process.
        Allotropic silver is a yellow-colored metal. But spectroscopic
        x-ray analysis and conventional metallurgical fire assay methods
        show the yellow material deposited on silver by the mutant
        microbes comprises trace amounts of nano gold particles.<br>
        <br>
        [0006] <span style="font-weight: bold;">Nanotechnology.</span>
        Nanoparticles are of great scientific interest as they are
        effectively a bridge between bulk materials and atomic or
        molecular structures. A bulk material should have constant
        physical properties regardless of its size, but at the
        nano-scale this is often not the case.<br>
        <br>
        [0007] The properties of materials change as their size
        approaches the nanoscale and as the percentage of atoms at the
        surface of a material becomes significant. For bulk materials
        larger than one micrometer the percentage of atoms at the
        surface is minuscule relative to the total number of atoms of
        the material.<br>
        <br>
        [0008] Nanoparticles exhibit a number of special properties
        relative to bulk material. At the nanoscale, matter behaves
        differently than it does at the bulk scale (&gt;100 nm). A
        metal's color, melting point, strength, conductivity, magnetism,
        and crystal structure can be drastically different at the
        nanoscale. Nanoparticles often have unexpected visible
        properties because they are small enough to confine their
        electrons and produce quantum effects. For example, gold
        nanoparticles appear deep red to black in solution and have
        melting points in the range of 350 C for nano gold particles
        with a diameter of 2 nm (nanometer) to 600 C (600 degrees
        centigrade) for nano gold particles with a diameter of 9 nm. See

        [0009] British Patent #GB2,219,995A (Dec. 28, 1989) of David
        Hudson reports that noble metal elements in monoatomic forms are
        stable and non-metallic, have electron orbital arrangements in
        the "d", "s", and "p" orbitals that bestow upon the monoatomic
        forms unique electronic, chemical, magnetic and physical
        properties.<br>

        [0010] <span style="font-weight: bold;">Microbes for
          Aggregating and Coalescing Nano Gold</span>. Researchers in
        Australia have uncovered evidence that a bacterial known as
        Ralstonia metallidurans may accumulate nano gold particles and
        aggregate them into bulk gold that looks like coral.<br>
        <br>
        [0011] <span style="font-weight: bold;">Nano Gold Particles
          Production</span>. Gold salts are readily reduced to elemental
        nano gold particles, and chemical methods for making old
        nanoparticles have been known for a long time. In 2002,
        Gardea-Torresdey, J. L. et al; Nano Lett,; (Communication);
        2002; 2(4); 397-401 reported a biologically based process using
        ordinary alfalfa plants to accumulate very small nano particles
        of gold. It is important that gold nano particles be benign to
        human health and the environment. A goal of many scientists is
        to introduce gold nano particles into humans to fight cancer and
        other diseases in pure water, food or nutritional supplements.
        Potentially, the most environmental friendly method for
        producing nano gold particles for human health would be nano
        gold atoms produced by safe and non-pathogenic microbes such as
        baking yeast.<br>
        <br>
        [0012] <span style="font-weight: bold;">Phonon Resonance</span>.
        Online publications in 2001 by co-inventor, Joe E Champion, in
        the area of phonon resonance proposes a mathematical formula
        that calculates the exact frequency that a known element will
        resonate at the resonance frequency of another element and
        theorizes that when a first element is made to vibrate at the
        resonance frequency of a second element, the first element can
        be transformed into the second element.<br>
        <br>
        [0013] According to Champion the phonon technology for gold
        production uses a phonon reactor for resonating silver or
        aluminum in an electromagnetic field of an electric circuit at
        certain critical temperatures. Silver is resonated at 43.2[deg.]
        C. and an aluminum block is resonated at 302.9[deg.] C.
        According to Champion, aluminum is transformed to gold and
        silver is transformed to gold in a low energy nuclear reaction.
        The nano gold atoms are captured in a water bath. Research is
        ongoing to verify this phenomena.<br>
        <br>
        [0014] <span style="font-weight: bold;">Microbes for Precious
          Metal Recovery</span>. The uses of microbes for recovering
        precious metals from mineral ores are known. Precious metals are
        frequently occluded, encapsulated, bonded and/or alloyed in
        mineral ores and are not amenable to conventional recovery
        methods. For example, gold often occurs as finely disseminated
        sub-microscopic particles within a refractory sulfide host of
        pyrite or arsenopyrite. Bio-oxidation is used to liberate the
        gold occluded within the sulfide host. A number of processes for
        bio-oxidizing the sulfide minerals are known in the art. One
        known method of bio-oxidizing the metal sulfides in an ore is to
        use bacteria, such as Thiobacillus ferrooxidans, sulfolobus,
        acidianus species and facultative-thermophilic bacteria in a
        microbial pretreatment.<br>
        <br>
        [0015] <span style="font-weight: bold;">Microbes for Biofuel
          Production.</span> The use of microorganisms to produce
        methane and ethanol from organic matter are known in the art.
        For example, ethanol for use as fuel and in alcoholic beverages
        is produced by fermentation of sugar by certain species of yeast
        (most importantly, Saccharomyces cerevisiae).<br>
        <br>
        [0016] Applicants have discovered that mutant microbes obtained
        by mutating microbes in aqueous solution with metallic silver or

        <span style="font-weight: bold;">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</span><br
          style="font-weight: bold;">
        <br>
        [0023] According to an exemplary embodiment, a mutant microbe
        that generates trace amounts of gold on silver, and uses of the
        mutant microbe for producing and recovering precious metals and
        for producing biofuels and oil products from biomass and
        sedimentary organic matter are described. According to an
        exemplary embodiment, the mutant microbe is produced by placing
        metallic silver in an aqueous solution and adding a species of
        Saccharomyces to the aqueous solution. When the species of
        Saccharomyces comes in contact with the metallic silver, at
        least a portion of the species of Saccharomyces transforms into
        the mutant microbe that interacts with the metallic silver to
        form a layer comprising a trace amount of nano gold particles on
        the metallic silver.<br>
        <br>
        [0024] According to exemplary embodiments, the mutant microbes
        are used for recovering nano precious metals atoms from mineral
        ores by contacting an aqueous solution of the mutant microbes
        with a mineral ore.<br>
        <br>
        [0025] According to other exemplary embodiments, a method for
        producing oil products and biofuels from a sedimentary organic
        rock, heavy oil, and/or a biomass comprises contacting the
        sedimentary organic rock, heavy oil and/or biomass with the
        mutant microbe in aqueous solution.<br>
        <br>
        [0026] In another exemplary embodiment, a method for
        bioconverting heavy oil to lower viscosity oil comprises
        contacting the heavy oil with the mutant microbe in aqueous
        solution.<br>
        <br>
        [0027] In another exemplary embodiment, the mutation process and
        production of precious metals and biofuels is carried out with
        air flow from a phonon resonance reactor using coiled silver or
        aluminum tubing.<br>

        [0036] <span style="font-weight: bold;">Silver Mutation.</span>
        In an exemplary embodiment, the microbes are mutated from
        industrial microbes by a process which comprises contacting the
        microbe(s) in an aqueous solution with metallic silver
        particles, grains, granules, and/or bars, e.g., silver ranging
        in size from 1 micrometer (micron) particles to silver bars of
        10 kilograms or more. Colloidal silver solutions with colloidal
        silver in aqueous solution ranging in concentration from 1 ppm
        to 10 ppm and particle sizes from 1 nanometer to 1 micron can be
        used. However, metallic silver of 1 micron or more in size to
        silver bars of 10 kilogram or more is preferably used. In one
        embodiment, silver grains of particle size from 0.1 millimeter
        to 1 millimeter and silver needles with high surface area,
        produced by electrolytic refining, from about 10 microns to 200
        microns, can be used. The mutation process can also use nano
        silver atoms produced in situ by resonating a silver or aluminum
        tube in an electromagnetic field. In another embodiment, the
        bioreactor for contacting the silver and microbes is made of
        silver, for example, a silver tank or container of any size or
        configuration.<br>
        <br>
        [0037] <span style="font-weight: bold;">Microbes.</span> In the
        embodiments described, microbes used in the invention are known
        commercial microbes widely used in industrial microbiology,
        including those of the genus of Saccharomyces and
        Schizosaccharomyces. Species of Saccharomyces include the
        species: S. cerevisiae, S. bayanus, S. boulardii, S.
        pastorianus, S. uvarum, S. carlsbergensis, S. ellisoidesu, S.
        exiguus, S. fragilis, S. chevalieri, S. chodati, S. diastaticus
        and S. rouxii. Species of Schizosaccharomyces is
        Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Other commonly known and industrial
        microbes that can be used include Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus
        orzae, Ashbya gossypii, Streptomyces species, Bacillus
        thuringiensis, Rhizobium, Bradyrhizobium, Bacillus subtilis,
        Corynebacterium glutamicum, Leuconostoc mesenteroides,
        Streptodornase pyogenes, and Thiobacillus ferrooxidans. The
        genus Saccharomyces is a fungi that can be used. The species are
        S. cerevisiae and S. carlsbergensis. These yeasts are
        commercially available and have been used for baking and beer
        making for thousand of years.<br>
        <br>
        [0038] <span style="font-weight: bold;">Mutation Conditions.</span>
        The contacting can be done without agitation, but preferably
        with mechanical agitation, air agitation (pumping air or oxygen
        into the aqueous solution) and/or pumping and passing the
        microbe in an aqueous nutrient solution through columns, tubes
        and tanks containing metallic silver or constructed with
        metallic silver. The mutation may be done at temperatures
        ranging from 20[deg.] C. to 90[deg.] C. In one embodiment, a
        temperature ranging from 30[deg.] C. 50[deg.] C. is used.
        Natural sunlight can be a heat source in one embodiment.<br>
        <br>
        [0039] <span style="font-weight: bold;">Nutrients.</span> The
        aqueous solution may contain sufficient nutrients to support
        microbial growth. The useful nutrients are both inorganic and
        organic compounds commonly used to grow and nourish microbes.
        Inorganic nutrients include nitric acid, ammonium nitrate,
        ammonium chloride, ammonium sulfate, sodium nitrate, sulfur,
        sodium sulfide, sodium chloride, sodium bicarbonate, sodium
        phosphate, potassium phosphate, ferric chloride, calcium
        chloride, and ammonium phosphate. Organic nutrients include
        microbes used for mutation, microbial biomass, glucose,
        dextrose, sodium acetate, amino acids, and purines. Microbial
        biomass may be dead microbes being used for mutation Vitamins
        that can be included in the nutrient solution include
        pyridoxine, pyridoxamine-HCl, riboflavin, thiamine, niacin,
        pantothenic acid, p-aminobenzoic acid, folic acid, and biotin.
        Very small amounts of trace elements such as iron, copper,
        molybdenum and zinc can also be provided in the nutrient
        solution. Useful nutrients can also be mineral ores used for
        recovery of metals and sedimentary organic matter and rocks used
        for liberation of oil products.<br>
        <br>
        [0040] In one embodiment, the mutation process is done in an
        aqueous solution and the microbes being mutated and the biomass
        from dead microbes are used as nutrients until the mutant
        microbes reach a density of 5% to 10% or more. The highest
        mutant microbe population density is obtained with silver with
        high surface area produced by electrolytic refining and silver
        grains of from 0.1 to 1 millimeter.<br>
        <br>
        [0041] <span style="font-weight: bold;">Silver and Ultraviolet
          Germicidal Irradiation</span>. In another exemplary
        embodiment, microbes can be mutated by ultraviolet (UV)
        germicidal irradiation and by a combination of metallic silver
        and UV irradiation. UV light is electromagnetic radiation with
        wavelengths shorter than visible light. UV radiation can be
        separated into various ranges, with near range (less than 280
        nm/2800 Angstrom) considered "germicidal UV". In one embodiment,
        UV radiation in the range of 280 nm to 390 nm is used. Exposure
        of microbes to UV irradiation is done with germicidal lamps that
        emit germicidal UV electromagnetic radiation. Forced flow of air
        or water can be used to agitate the microbial solution to ensure
        exposure to the UV radiation. The mutation using UV light may be
        done at temperatures ranging from 20[deg.] C. to 80[deg.] C.,
        and preferably at temperatures ranging from 30[deg.] C. to
        50[deg.] C. In a preferred embodiment, the UV irradiation and
        the silver germicidal mutation processes are done together.<br>
        <br>
        [0042] <span style="font-weight: bold;">Electromagnetic Field</span>.
        In another embodiment, the mutation process is conducted in a
        bioreactor with means to provide an electromagnetic field. The
        electromagnetic field can be provided by wrapping the
        bioreactor, such as a beaker, with copper wire, aluminum wire or
        silver wire and running an AC current of about 5 to 10 amps
        through the wire. In large bioreactors, for example, 1000 liters
        to 10000 liters, the microbial solution can be pumped through a
        glass column wrapped with copper, aluminum or silver wire for
        current flow. The current can be provided with a variable
        transformer power supply.<br>
        <br>
        [0043] <span style="font-weight: bold;">Phonon Resonance
          Reactor.</span> In another embodiment, the mutation process of
        contacting silver with a microbe is conducted with air flow from
        a resonating aluminum or silver tubing carrying an electric
        charge or from aluminum or silver tubing placed in an
        electromagnetic field of an electric furnace. Such a furnace,
        referred to as a phonon resonance reactor, is illustrated in
        FIG. 1. The silver or aluminum tubing 110 is coiled and placed
        in the furnace 102. In one embodiment, both ends of the tubing
        112a, 112b are passed through holes in the walls or door of the
        furnace 102. In one embodiment, at least one end of the tubing,
        e.g., 112a, can be coupled to an external power supply 104 that
        provides a current through the tubing 110, thereby creating the
        electromagnetic field.<br>
        <br>
        [0044] An air stream is passed through one end, e.g., 112a, and
        out the other end 112b of the tubing to a bioreactor used for
        contacting silver with microbes to mutate. Air flow with
        pressure from 1 psi to 10 psi is passed through to the
        bioreactor at about 1 ccm (cubic centimeter per minute) to 100
        ccm.<br>
        <br>
        [0045] In one embodiment, an aquarium-type bubble stone or
        bubble curtain (not shown) which produces very small bubbles in
        the range of 1 millimeter or less is used to increase the
        surface area of the air bubbles flowing to the bioreactor. The
        tube diameter can range from 1 mm to 2 cm, preferably from 1 mm
        to 5 mm. The air flow can be passed through the tube clockwise
        or counterclockwise. The coiled tube 110 can be placed in the
        furnace 102 with the central axis, i.e., an axis running through
        the center of each coil, vertical or horizontal. The
        configuration can also include a plurality of parallel tubes 110
        or other common configuration of tubes used for heat exchangers.<br>
        <br>
        [0046] For air flow from a silver tube 110, the temperature of
        the tube 110, and therefore the airflow, can be between 20[deg.]
        C. to 100[deg.] C., preferably from 40[deg.] C. and 45[deg.] C.
        In one embodiment, the airflow tube 110 temperature is about
        43.2[deg.] C. For air flow from an aluminum tube, the
        temperature of the tube 110 and airflow temperature can be
        between about 20[deg.] C. to 350[deg.] C., preferably from
        270[deg.] C. to 310[deg.] C. In one embodiment, the temperature
        is approximately 302.9[deg.] C.<br>
        <br>
        [0047] It is believed that heating silver to approximately
        43.2[deg.] C. produces the mechanical vibrations of silver which
        are the same mechanical vibrational frequencies of gold.
        Similarly, it is believed that heating aluminum to about
        302.9[deg.] C. produces the mechanical vibrations of aluminum
        which are the same as the mechanical vibrational frequencies of
        gold and silver. The vibrational frequencies in turn assist the
        microbes in the formation of gold and silver nano atoms and
        improve and increase the rate of the mutation process.<br>
        <br>
        [0048] The mutation process can be conducted at, below or above
        atmospheric pressure. The mutation can be done in the presence
        of light or in the absence of light. Light bulbs and sunshine
        can be used as light sources.<br>
        <br>
        [0049] The mutation can be conducted in aerobic or anaerobic
        conditions. Moreover, the mutation can be conducted in the
        presence of nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and/or oxygen in the
        atmosphere. Oxygen can be provided chemically, for example, with
        hydrogen peroxide, or as a gas from pressurized vessels.<br>
        <br>
        [0050] Microbial growth and population density can be measured
        by conventional direct methods such as plate count, serial
        dilution, pour plates, spread plates and direct microscope
        count. Microbial growth can also be measured by indirect methods
        such as turbidity and metabolic activity. In one embodiment,
        microbial growth can also be measured by the time period
        required to coat silver grains of 1 mm to 3 mm with a yellow
        coating of nano gold particles. With a healthy population of
        about 5% to 10% or more, the yellow coating is produced in about
        2 hours to 24 hours. The yellow coating formed on silver is one
        test for identifying the mutant microbes of the invention. No
        other known microbes can coat silver with a yellow colored layer
        comprised of nano gold particles.<br>
        <br>
        [0051] The mutant microbes may be single-celled or multi-celled
        microbes. They are usually round but can be oval, elongated or
        flattened on one side. The mutant microbes from the genus
        Saccharomyces have also been observed to be rod-shaped bacillus.
        They range from 0.20 to 2.0 micron in diameter and 2 to 8 micron
        in length. They have been observed to divide by budding and
        binary cell division. The mutant microbes are also characterized
        by the ability to stay alive when subjected to high temperatures
        from 100 C to 150 C, and to strongly basic and acidic
        environments.<br>
        <br>
        [0052] According to one embodiment, the mutant microbes can be
        identified and characterized by their ability to coat silver
        granules with a coating of a yellow material which comprises
        trace amount of nano gold particles. The coating process is done
        by contacting an aqueous solution of the mutant microbes with
        metallic silver. The amount of yellow material coated onto the
        silver ranges from 1 ppm to 1000 ppm and depends upon the
        contact time, contact temperature and density of the microbial
        solution. The temperature ranges from 20[deg.] C. to 90[deg.] C.
        The contact time ranges from one hour to 100 hours. With a high
        microbial density of approximately 3 to 5% by weight, the
        contact time is about 1 to 4 hours. The amount of nano gold
        particles in the yellow coating is about 100 ppm to 200 ppm or
        more based on X-ray diffraction analysis and scanning electron
        microscope analysis.<br>
        <br>
        [0053] Once created, the mutant microbes can be stored and
        maintained by conventional microbiological techniques. A healthy
        mutant microbe can be isolated and grown to microbe colonies of
        1% to 5% by weight in nutrient solutions. Nutrients can be
        inorganic, including nitric acid, ammonium nitrate, ammonium
        chloride, ammonium sulfate, sulfur, sodium sulfide, sodium
        nitrate, sodium chloride, sodium bicarbonate, sodium phosphate,
        potassium phosphate, ferric chloride, calcium chloride, ammonium
        phosphate, and organic, including microbes used for mutation,
        microbial biomass, glucose, dextrose, sodium acetate, amino
        acids, and purines. Vitamins that can be included in the
        nutrient solution include pyridoxine, pyridoxamine-HCl,
        riboflavin, thiamine, niacin, pantothenic acid, p-aminobenzoic
        acid, folic acid, and biotin. Microbial biomass may be dead
        microbes being used for mutation. Very small amounts of trace
        elements such as iron, copper, molybdenum and zinc can also be
        provided in the nutrient solution. When it is desirable to grow
        the mutant microbes on a solid medium, a solidifying agent such
        as agar (a complex polysaccharide derived from a marine alga) is
        added to the media.<br>
        <br>
        [0054] According to one embodiment, the mutant microbes
        described herein have been found to contain clusters of precious
        metal atoms within the cytoplasm of the cell. The metals within
        the cytoplasm are observed as clusters, curved bands and/or
        circular rings of metal atoms. Some mutant microbes have sets of
        two to ten concentric rings. Using a scanning electron
        microscope, the clusters, bands, and/or concentric rings of
        metal atoms within the cellular structure can be identified as
        silver and gold atoms and particles.<br>

        ore" means a composition that comprises precious metal values in
        the form of nano precious metal particles. Thus, a mineral may
        be a mined mineral, ancient seabed deposit, ancient lakebed
        deposit, black sands, an ore concentrate, metal bearing sea
        water, and waste products, such as mining tails, industrial
        waste water, oil well brine, coal tars, oil shales, tar sands,
        and oil sands. Useful minerals contain amounts of nano precious
        metals atoms or particles in the range of 0.1% to 5% by weigh.
        Generally, the amount of nano particles is only 0.1% to 1% by
        weight. It is extremely difficult to detect nano precious metal
        atoms in mineral ores by conventional metallurgical assay
        procedures such as fire assay, AAS (atomic adsorption
        spectroscopy), ICP-MS (inductive coupled plasma-mass
        spectrometer), ICP-AES (atomic emission spectroscopy) and other
        spectroscopic instrumentation commonly used in analytical
        laboratories. Thus, the amount of nano metal particles in a
        mineral ore can only be known after biotreatment with the mutant
        microbes and the yield of bulk precious metals is determined by
        recovery. Also, biotreatment with mutant microbes can be used as
        a diagnostic test for nano precious metal values in mineral
        ores.<br>
        <br>
        [0056]<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Biomining-Digestion and
          Nano Metal Recovery.</span> In one embodiment, the digestion
        and biotreatment of the mutant microbes with the mineral ores
        are conducted in commercially available bioreactors consisting
        of a reactor having an agitation means. The agitation means can
        be mechanical stirring with a flat bladed impeller, percolation
        column, or air agitated pachuca reactor. The bioreactor can have
        air intake means, sterilization means, harvesting means, heating
        and/or cooling means, temperature controller means, pH
        controller means, filtration means and pressure controller
        means. All these features of bioreactors are known and
        commercially available in the biotechnology industry. The
        digestion the mineral ores by the mutant microbes can also be
        done by heap leaching techniques. In heap bio leaching
        techniques, a large body of mineral ore is treated with mutant
        microbes in nutrient solution in large contaminant ponds with no
        agitation and/or only occasionally agitation. Generally, the
        contact time for heap type bio treatment is substantially longer
        than the agitated bioreactors, and range from 10 days to 100
        days.<br>
        <br>
        [0057] The mineral ore can be milled and ground to 10 mesh to
        300 mesh, preferably 100 to 200 mesh. The minerals useful in the
        invention are low grade and high grade precious metal minerals
        containing the nano precious metal particles. Low grade minerals
        contain from 1 ppb to 1 ppm of a precious metal, preferably gold
        and silver (1 oz/ton is 34.3 ppm). High grade minerals contain
        from 2 ppm to 100 ppm. Bio treatment temperature ranges from
        15[deg.] C. to 50[deg.] C., preferably from 20[deg.] C. to
        30[deg.] C. pH can be acidic (pH 1 to 3) or basic (pH 9 to 12),
        although slightly acidic (pH 4) to slightly basic (pH 8) pH
        ranges are preferred. The most preferred pH ranges are the
        neutral range of from pH 6.5 to pH 7.5. At low mutant microbe
        concentrations, the contact duration is generally longer to
        allow the mutant microbe to grow and multiply. In one
        embodiment, the microbe concentration does not exceed the
        maximum microbe concentration that the nutrient solution can
        sustain. Contact time can vary from a few hours to several weeks
        and depends in part on the type and mesh size of the mineral ore
        digested. Contact time ranges can be from 1 day to 30 days, more
        preferably from 1 day to 10 days. Generally for ease of
        agitation, a ratio of mineral ore to microbe/nutrient solution,
        i.e., the pulp density, varies from 10% by weight mineral ore in
        the nutrient solution to 50% by weight mineral ore in the
        nutrient solution.<br>
        <br>
        [0058] The digestion can be conducted in aerobic or anaerobic
        conditions. However, the digestion is preferably conducted in
        the presence of oxygen, nitrogen and carbon dioxide in the
        atmosphere. Nutrients can also be provided in the digestion of
        mineral ore to support growth of the mutant microbes. Nutrients
        can be inorganic, including nitric acid, sulfur, ammonium
        nitrate, ammonium chloride, ammonium sulfate, sodium nitrate,
        sodium chloride, sodium bicarbonate, sodium phosphate, potassium
        nitrate, potassium phosphate, ferric chloride, calcium chloride,
        ammonium phosphate, and organic, including the microbes used for
        mutation, glucose, dextrose, sodium acetate, amino acids, and
        purines. Vitamins that can be included in the nutrient solution
        include pyridoxine, pyridoxamine-HCl, riboflavin, thiamine,
        niacin, pantothenic acid, p-aminobenzoic acid, folic acid, and
        biotin. Very small amounts of trace elements such as iron,
        copper, molybdenum and zinc can also be provided in the nutrient
        solution. In one embodiment, the organic nutrients are present
        in the mineral ores as sedimentary organic matter. Examples are
        sedimentary organic rocks such as oil shale, tar sands and other
        fossil fuels such as anthracite coal, bituminous coal,
        sub-bituminous coal, and lignite. In one embodiment, inorganic
        nutrients are present in the metal mineral ores for liberation
        of metals.<br>
        <br>
        [0059] Nutrients, including additional microbes used for
        mutation, can be added to the digestion as needed to maintain
        the sufficient mutant microbes for microbial growth and nano
        metal aggregation. Microbial growth can be measured by
        conventional direct methods such as plate count, serial
        dilution, pour plates, spread plates and direct microscope
        count. Microbial growth can also be measured by indirect methods
        such as turbidity and metabolic activity.<br>
        <br>
        [0060] After digestion with the mutant microbes, the recovery of
        metal from the mineral ore and microbial solution can be carried
        out by conventional metallurgical methods such as gravity
        concentration, smelting, leaching, electrolysis, resins and
        other methods known to those skilled in art of metallurgy. The
        nano silver and gold atoms produced in the bioreactor are
        generally coalesced and aggregated into metal particles which
        drop to the bottom of the bioreactor and are recovered by
        decanting. panning or conventional gravity methods of precious
        methods such vibrating tables, sluice boxes, spiral gold panning
        bowls, or trommels commonly used in the placer mining industry
        for the separation and recovery of precious methods.<br>
        <br>
        [0061] In another embodiment, the precious metals in the mutant
        microbes or biomass of dead mutant microbes can be recovered
        from the biomass of dead mutant microbes. In this embodiment,
        the precious metals in the biomass of dead mutant microbes can
        be recovered by burning off the biomass at a temperature of
        150[deg.] C. to 350[deg.] C. to produce a residue of silver and
        gold, which can be recovered by conventional metallurgical
        methods.<br>
        <br>
        [0062] <span style="font-weight: bold;">Sedimentary Organic
          Matter and Rocks</span>. According to other exemplary
        embodiments, the mutant microbes can be used for producing oil
        products and biofuels from sedimentary organic matter and rocks.
        Suitable sedimentary organic matter includes coal, bituminous
        coal, sub-bituminous coal, lignite, bitumen, coal tar, fly ash,
        oil shale, tar sands and oil sands. Sedimentary organic matter
        that contains a high content of sulfur and sulfides can be used.
        Oil shale is found in the Western United States, especially the
        states of Utah, Wyoming, and Colorado, and oil sands found in
        northern Alberta, Canada. Oil shale is a general term applied to
        a group of rocks rich enough in organic matter (called kerogen)
        to yield oil products upon distillation. Oil sands, also
        referred to as tar sands or bituminous sands, are a combination
        of clay, sand, water and bitumen. Sedimentary organic matter and
        rocks generally contain from 1% to 99% organic matter,
        preferably 10 to 90% organic matter.<br>
        <br>
        [0063] <span style="font-weight: bold;">Minerals for Metals and
          Biofuels Co-Production.</span> With sedimentary organic matter
        and fossil fuels containing precious and base metals, both
        metals and gaseous and liquid petroleum and metals can be
        liberated and produced by the mutant microbes. After bio
        treatment, petroleum products are recovered and refined by
        conventional petroleum processes and the precious and base
        metals are recovered by conventional precious metal
        beneficiation processes such as gravity concentration,
        amalgamation, electrowinning, cyanidation, etc. In one
        embodiment, the mutant microbes can be used to treat a mixture
        of a metal mineral ore and sedimentary organic matter and/or a
        fossil fuel. In this embodiment, the liquid oil products
        released from the sedimentary organic matter captures and floats
        the metals released from the metal mineral ore by a process
        similar to flotation or froth flotation processes used in the
        mining industry. The bio treatment procedures used for
        bio-energy and bio-fuel production are the same as the
        biotreatment and digestion procedures used for liberation of
        metals, and are known industrial biotech processing procedures.<br>
        <br>
        [0064] <span style="font-weight: bold;">Biofuels from Biomass</span>.
        According to other exemplary embodiments, the mutant microbes
        can be used for producing oil products and biofuels from
        biomass. Biomass is any recently living organisms or their
        metabolic by products. Biomass can be of plant or animal origin.
        Useful biomass include agricultural residues such as rice straw,
        stover, wheat straw; agricultural wastes such as sugarcane
        bagasse, rice hulls, corn fiber, sugar beet pulp, citrus pulp,
        citrus peels; forestry wastes such as hardwood and softwood
        thinning and hardwood and softwood residues from timber
        operations; and wood wastes such as saw mill waste and pulp and
        paper mill waste; urban wastes such as the paper fraction of
        municipal solid waste; urban wood waste and urban green waste,
        and dedicated crops such as switchgrass, hybrid poplar wood,
        grains, maiden grass. Simple sugars or monosaccharides, such as
        glucose, fructose, and dextrose can also be used. Preferred
        biomass feed stocks are plant cellulosic biomass-that is,
        biomass composed primarily of inedible plant fibers having
        cellulose and hemicellulose as a prominent component. The
        biofuel produced depends on the biomass feedstock, and include
        methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanol, mixed alcohols, and other
        biogases. In biorefining and bioconverting embodiments, the
        mutant microbes are used to convert, refine and degrade heavy
        oils, bitumen, asphalt and tar to lower molecular weight and
        density petroleum products.<br>
        <br>
        [0065]<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Heavy Oil and Enhanced
          Oil Recovery</span>. A preferred form of biomass is heavy oil.
        The mutant microbes can be used for bioconversion, biorefining
        and biodegradation of heavy oil that is too viscous to ship
        through a pipeline to lighter oil that can be shipped in
        pipelines. Examples are surface heavy oil deposits, heavy oil
        recovered from oil sands and oil shale and heavy oil in oil
        wells and in depleted and abandoned oil wells. The mutant
        microbes can be injected into the oil wells with water and/or
        steam commonly used for secondary and enhanced oil recovery.
        Once the heavy oil is biodegraded to oil of a lower viscosity,
        it can be pumped from the oil well and transported in pipelines.
        The mutant microbes can also be used to bioconvert surface heavy
        oil deposits to lighter oil products that can also be shipped in
        pipelines.<br>
        <br>
        [0066] <span style="font-weight: bold;">Biorefining,
          bioconversion and biodegrading methods.</span> The digestion
        and biotreatment of the mutant microbes with biomass, heavy oil
        and sedimentary organic matter can be conducted in commercially
        available bioreactors consisting of a reactor having an
        agitation means. The agitation means can be mechanical stirring
        with a flat bladed impeller, percolation column, air agitated
        Pachuca reactors, and continuous flow stirred tank reactors. The
        bioreactor can have air intake means, sterilization means,
        harvesting means, heating and/or cooling means, temperature
        controller means, pH controller means, filtration means and
        pressure controller means. All these features of bioreactors are
        known and commercially available in the biotechnology,
        biorefining and biomining industry. The digestion the biomass
        and sedimentary organic matter by the mutant microbes can also
        be done by heap leaching techniques. In heap bio leaching
        techniques, a large body of mineral ore is placed in a heap or
        dump where is it irrigated and treated with mutant microbes.
        Generally, the contact time for heap type bio treatment is
        substantially longer than the agitated bioreactors, and range
        from 10 days to 100 days.<br>
        <br>
        [0067] The biomass and sedimentary organic matter can be milled
        and ground to particles in the range of 10 mesh to 300 mesh,
        preferably 100 to 200 mesh. Bio treatment temperature ranges
        from 15[deg.] C. to 90[deg.] C., preferably from 20[deg.] C. to
        50[deg.] C. pH can be acidic (pH 1 to 3) or basic (pH 9 to 12),
        although slightly acidic (pH 4) to slightly basic (pH 8) pH
        ranges are preferred. The most preferred pH ranges are the
        neutral range of from pH 6.5 to pH 7.5.<br>
        <br>
        [0068] At low mutant microbe concentration, the contact duration
        is generally longer to allow the mutant microbes to grow and
        multiply. Contact time can vary from a few hours to several
        weeks and depends in part on the type and mesh size of the
        biomass and sedimentary organic matter digested. Contact time
        ranges can be from 1 day to 30 days, more preferably from 1 day
        to 10 days. The ratio of biomass and sedimentary organic matter
        to microbial solution can vary. Generally for ease of agitation
        in stirred-tanks, the pulp density can vary from 10% by weight
        mineral ore in the microbial solution to 50% by weight mineral
        ore in the microbial solution, preferably about 15% by weight to
        25% by weight. The digestion can be conducted in aerobic or
        anaerobic conditions. However, the mutation is preferably
        conducted in the presence of oxygen, nitrogen and carbon dioxide
        in the atmosphere.<br>
        <br>
        [0069] Nutrients can also be provided in the digestion of
        biomass, heavy oil or sedimentary organic matter to support
        growth of the mutant microbes. Nutrients can be inorganic,
        including nitric acid, ammonium nitrate, ammonium chloride,
        ammonium sulfate, sodium chloride, sodium bicarbonate, sodium
        phosphate, potassium phosphate, ferric chloride, calcium
        chloride, ammonium phosphate, and organic, including microbes
        used for mutation, glucose, dextrose, sodium acetate, amino
        acids, and purines. Suitable media for growing mutant microbes
        and producing precious metals are nutrient media containing 1 to
        10% by weight nitric acid. Vitamins that can be included in the
        nutrient solution include pyridoxine, pyridoxamine-HCl,
        riboflavin, thiamine, niacin, pantothenic acid, p-aminobenzoic
        acid, folic acid, and biotin. Very small amounts of traces
        elements such as iron, copper, molybdenum and zinc can also be
        provided in the nutrient solution. The microbes used for
        mutation, biomass and organic matter present in sedimentary
        organic matter also serve as nutrients.<br>
        <br>
        [0070] Nutrients can be added to the digestion as needed to
        maintain the sufficient mutant microbes for microbial growth.
        Microbial growth can be measured by conventional direct methods
        such as plate count, serial dilution, pour plates, spread plates
        and direct microscope count. Microbial growth can also be
        measured by indirect methods such as turbidity and metabolic
        activity.<br>

        [0071]<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Metals and Biofuels
          Co-Production</span>. With sedimentary organic matter and
        fossil fuels containing precious and base metals, both metals
        and gaseous and liquid petroleum and metals are liberated and
        produced by the mutant microbes. After bio treatment, petroleum
        products are recovered and refined by conventional petroleum
        processes and the precious and base metals are recovered by
        conventional precious metal beneficiation processes such as
        gravitation concentration, amalgamation, electrowinning,
        cyanidation, etc. In one embodiment the mutant microbes are used
        to treat a mixture of a metal mineral ore and sedimentary
        organic matter and/or a fossil fuel. In this embodiment, the
        liquid oil products released from the sedimentary organic matter
        captures and floats the metals released from the metal mineral
        ore by a process similar to flotation or froth flotation
        processes used in the mining industry. The bio treatment
        procedures used for bio-energy and bio-fuel production are the
        same as the biotreatment and digestion procedures used for
        liberation of metals and are known industrial bio tech
        processing procedures.<br>
        <br>
        [0072] <span style="font-weight: bold;">Biotreatment
          Enhancement with Phonon Resonance Reactor.</span> In another
        embodiment, the biotreatment and digestion of mineral ores,
        sedimentary organic matter and biomass is conducted with air
        flow from a resonating aluminum or silver tube excited with
        electromagnetic resonance, i.e., a phonon resonance reactor, as
        shown in FIG. 1. Although it is not known with certainty, it is
        believed that the resonance of the electric field causes the
        silver to resonate at the same mechanical vibrational
        frequencies of gold which assists the microbes in the production
        of gold and the aggregation of nano metal atoms. Similarly, it
        is believed that the force of the electric field causes aluminum
        to resonate at the same mechanical vibrational frequencies of
        gold and silver. The coiled tube greatly enhances and improves
        the resonating of the aluminum and silver vibrations due to
        containment within tube and increases excitation from resonating
        back and forth within the tube. The gold and silver vibrational
        frequencies in turn assist the mutant microbes in the formation
        of gold and silver nano atoms and improve the digestion and
        biotreatment processes.<br>
        <br>
        [0073]<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Precious Metal
          Production inside a Resonating Aluminum and Silver Tube</span>.
        In another embodiment, precious metals are produced by phonon
        resonance produced inside aluminum and silver tubing in an
        electromagnetic field. Other types of metal tubing, for example,
        platinum, palladium, gold, iron, zinc, titanium, copper, and
        magnesium, can also be used. For precious metal production, the
        same metal tube as the desired metal product can be used. For
        example, a gold tube is used to resonate gold to produce gold
        and a platinum tube is used to resonate platinum to produce
        platinum. The precious metals are produced as nano atoms which
        are coalesced and aggregated with a biodegradable organic
        medium. The phonon resonance inside aluminum or silver tubing is
        created with force of an electromagnetic field of an electric
        kiln shown in FIG. 1 or any known means of producing an
        electromagnetic field from an electrical circuit. The tubing can
        be placed inside a glass tube wrapped with electrical wire made
        of copper, aluminum or silver and an electric current passed
        through the electrical wire. The tubing can be wrapped with
        insulated electrically conductive wire, such as ceramic coated
        electric wire, and an electromagnetic field produced by passing
        a electric current through the wire. The tubing can be coiled
        and placed in the proximity of any means to provide an
        electromagnetic field. For example, an electromagnetic field
        created by wrapping a non-conducting container, such as a glass
        container, with copper wire, aluminum wire or silver wire and
        running an electric current of about 5 to 10 amps through the
        wire. The current can be provided with a variable transformer
        power supply with a voltage range of 1 to 100 volts. The
        aluminum or silver tubing temperature will depend upon the
        amount electric current passed through the aluminum or silver
        tubing or the amount of electric current in the electric circuit
        used to produce the electromagnetic field.<br>
        <br>
        [0074] <span style="font-weight: bold;">Coalescing and
          Aggregation of Nano Atoms.</span> The biodegradable organic
        medium includes the mutant microbes, common commercial
        microorganisms such as yeast from the genus Saccharomyces or a
        biodegradable organic compound. Preferred organic compounds are
        soluble or partially soluble in water and have a decomposition
        and boiling point of 500[deg.] F. or less so that the organic
        compound can be separated and removed by heating and
        vaporization in an oven and include low molecular weight
        aliphatic organic compound with oxygen containing functional
        groups such as hydroxyl, ether, carbonyl, carboxyl, and ester
        and include common organic compounds such as sugars, citric
        acid, acetic acid, oils, and fats. The extent of aggregation and
        the size of the precious metals produced are dependent upon the
        time period used for aggregation. Generally, metal clusters can
        be harvested about every 24 hours by gravity separation.
        However, the clusters of precious metals are large enough to
        recover by decanting or gravity separation in about 1 to 2
        hours. The metal clusters are off-white to black powders and
        generally contain about 5 to 10% of the organic medium which can
        be removed by vaporization at about 500[deg.] F.<br>
        <br>
        [0075] <span style="font-weight: bold;">Cupellation and Fire
          Assaying.</span> In the embodiments described, cupellation is
        used to separate noble metals such as gold or silver from base
        metals such as lead. It is often used to assay gold in order to
        test its purity. Sometimes cupellation is called "fire
        assaying." In this process, an alloy or mineral ore consisting
        of both noble and base metals is placed in a crucible. Flux
        materials such as borax glass, sodium carbonate, and wheat
        flour, can be added. This mixture is then melted and allowed to
        freeze. When solidified, a button consisting of precious metals
        and lead can be removed from the slag of metal oxides and other
        materials. After cooling, the metals are placed in a special pot
        made of bone ash or clay called a cupel. Under high heat, lead
        turns to litharge, a lead oxide, which is absorbed by the cupel
        or lost to the atmosphere. At the end of the cupellation
        process, a button of pure gold and silver remains in the bottom
        of the cupel. The button is then placed in nitric acid to
        dissolve the silver, and the remaining gold weighed to determine
        the gold content present in the material being assayed. Fire
        assaying and cupellation are described by C. W. Ammen, Recovery

        [0076] Metals produced by phonon resonance in an electromagnetic
        field according to the invention can be cupelled by wrapping in
        a lead sheet and heating in an electric kiln at about 1000 C.
        Base metals and lead are absorbed into the cupel and the
        precious metals form a metallic bead on the cupel.<br>

        [0078] <span style="font-weight: bold;">Mutation With Silver
          Granules</span>. A Petri dish containing 2 grams of silver
        granules, 4 grams of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and 10 ml of
        distilled water was stirred one or two times per day over a ten
        day period. A small sample of aqueous solution was then placed
        on a glass slide with cover. The slide was then examined under a
        Meiji binocular biological optical microscope. Live microbes
        could be observed with a dense band of metal atoms within its
        cellular structure at magnifications as low as *500 Some of the
        live microbes were then examined with a LEO model 1430VP
        electron scanning microscope with an EDAX x-ray diffraction
        detector (SEM) at 10,000 and 20,000 magnifications. Clear bands
        of metal atoms in concentric rings can be observed. Using an
        EDAX x-ray spectrometer, the metal bands were determined to be
        metallic. Pictures of the mutant microbe viewed with the SEM are
        provided in FIG. 2 and FIG. 3.<br>

        <br>
        [0079] <span style="font-weight: bold;">Mutation in a Silver
          Container</span>. A 200-ml silver cylindrical container was
        filled with 100 ml of water and 5 grams of dry active
        Fleischmann's yeast. The microbial solution was heated at
        43[deg.] C. on a hot plate for 4 hours. The inside walls of the
        silver container was coated with a yellow color.<br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Example 3</span><br

        <br>
        [0080] <span style="font-weight: bold;">Mutation with Silver in
          Column</span>. A 200 gallon tank reactor about 2 feet wide, 2
        feet deep and 8 feet long was filled with about 600 liters of
        well water containing trace amounts of naturally occurring
        minerals. Three kilograms of silver granules was prepared by
        melting a 99.9% purity silver bars in a gas furnace and pouring
        the molten silver onto a stainless steel 60 mesh screen placed
        over a stainless steel drum filled with water. The silver
        granules were placed in a 6 cm diameter clear plastic
        percolation column. Five hundred grams of commercially
        manufactured S. Cerevisiae was added to the tank. The tank
        reactor was heated to about 40 degrees centigrade (40[deg.] C.)
        with an immersion stainless heater and the aqueous solution was
        pumped to the top of the percolation column with a submersible
        pump at the rate of about 40 liters per minute. Water was added
        as needed to keep the microbial solution volume at about 600
        liters. The S. Cerevisiae was allowed to mutate for a period of
        about 30 days until the population density of mutated microbes
        reached about 3% to 5% by weight. The mutant microbes in the
        tank reactor were observed under the SEM to have concentric
        rings of metal within the cellular structure. Under the optical
        microscope the mutant microbes appeared were rod shaped with a
        flatten bottom on one side. The size was about 1 to 10 microns.<br>
        <br>
        [0081] After about 10 days, the S. Cerevisiae have been
        completely mutated and/or died, about 500 grams cane sugar was
        added as nutrient for the mutant microbes. After about 30 days
        after most of S. Cerevisiae had been mutated, a 10 gram sample
        of the microbial solution was dried in a desiccator with a
        vacuum pump for 18 hours. The residue in the desiccator weighed
        0.5 grams.<br>
        <br>
        [0082] In addition, the silver in the silver column was emptied
        and mixed. A ten gram sample of silver granules was removed and
        the balance returned to the column. The silver granules from the
        column were a slight to dark yellow color. The ten gram sample
        was heated in a kiln at about 320[deg.] C. After one hour, the
        yellow-colored metal had vaporized and the silver granules were
        a silvery color. The silver granules were then cooled and
        weighed. After heating, the weight of silver granules decreased
        in weight by 6 mg. Based on this test, the amount of yellow
        metal coated on the silver granules was in the range of 6 parts
        in 10,000 parts.<br>
        <br>
        [0083] In addition, a 48-gram sample of silver granules coated
        with the yellow metal from the silver column in the tank reactor
        was removed after 35 days and placed in an Erlenmeyer flask and
        with 100 ml of 1N nitric acid solution. The flask was heated on
        a hot plate until the nitric acid solution reached about
        60[deg.] C. After about 30 minutes, a small amount of grey-black
        material was observed in the nitric acid solution and the silver
        granules no longer had a yellow color. The nitric acid was
        decanted from the silver granules and filtered onto a filter
        paper circle placed on a sinister glass filtration unit under
        vacuum. The nitric acid solution was saved for processing as
        described below in Example 3D. The filter paper and the
        grey-black material were washed with distilled water and placed
        on about 9 grams of a lead sheet, dried, folded and placed into
        a bone ash cupel. The cupel was heated at 1800[deg.] F. for
        about 30 minutes. On cooling, the cupel had a pale yellow bead
        weighing about 3 milligrams. The yellow bead was examined on the
        SEM. The spectrum showed silver and gold peaks.<br>
        <br>
        [0084] The silver granules in the Erlenmeyer flask after
        decanting the nitric acid solution was dried and found to weigh
        47.9 grams. The nitric acid solution/filtrate was placed in a
        beaker and heated to dryness at 200[deg.] C. A white and gray
        residue was formed in the bottom of the beaker. The beaker was
        then heated to about 280[deg.] C. until the white crystals
        melted to a clear liquid. Distilled water was then added. The
        grey material which did not dissolve in the water was filtered
        onto a filter paper circle placed on sinister glass filtration
        unit under vacuum. The filter paper and grey material were
        washed with distilled water and placed on about 10 grams of a
        lead sheet, dried, folded and heated and placed into a bone ash
        cupel. The cupel was heated at 1800[deg.] F. for about 30
        minutes. On cooling, the cupel had a pale yellow bead weighing
        about 3 milligrams. The yellow bead was examined on a scanning
        electron microscope. The spectrum showed silver and gold peaks.
        The recovery of precious metals, particularly platinum and
        palladium, from silver nitrate solutions as described in this
        Example is commonly called the "Crooks Process" by those skilled
        in the art of metallurgy.<br>
        <br>
        [0085] A yellow-colored silver granule from the silver column of
        was examined with the scanning electron microscope. The spectrum
        showed a major peak for gold, as shown in FIG. 4.<br>

        A 37 liter glass tank was filled with 12 liters distilled water,
        100 grams of 100 micron to 1 millimeter silver particles and 500
        grams of dry active Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Fleischmann
        brand). The tank was maintained at about 25[deg.] C. and
        agitated with a small fish aquarium pump and an air stone. The
        tank was exposed to an ultraviolet mercury lamp of 50 watts.
        After about five to nine days the microbe density was about 3 to
        4% by weight.<br>
        <br>
        [0087] The mutant microbes were analyzed with an Induced

        to three times a day to thoroughly suspend and disperse the
        silver through the yeast and water mixture. About every 3 to 4
        days, another 450 grams of yeast was added. Water was added as
        needed to maintain the volume in the container at about 20
        liters. After 10 days, about 60 grams silver needles were

        was allowed to settle to the bottom of tank. The microbial
        mixture was decanted into two 5-gallon buckets. Water was used
        to wash the silver needles on the bottom of container. From the
        bottom of the container, 290 grams of silver needles which
        looked like gold dust was recovered. The rinse water used to
        wash the silver needles was added to the two 5-gallon buckets of
        microbial solution to give a volume of about 10 liters in each

        Example 10D was placed side by side outdoors in full sunlight
        and a temperature of 75-85[deg.] F. during the day. One of the
        buckets (bucket #1) from example 10D was treated with air flow
        from the aluminum phonon resonance reactor described in Example
        26 for about 12 hours per day for a period of 15 days. The
        phonon reactor was operated at 302-305[deg.] C. After 15 days,
        the bucket was shaken with an industrial shaker for about 30
        minutes. The shaking caused a metal product to drop to the
        bottom of the bucket. The microbial solution was decanted from
        the bucket and the metal product on the bottom of bucket was
        washed with water and dried to give 120 grams of dark yellow
        metal product of about 0.1 milliliter to 0.5 milliliter size.
        Under the 100-power microscope the metal product looked like
        tiny nuggets without any smooth metallic surfaces found in the
        starting silver needles. A ten gram sample was wrapped in about
        9 grams of lead sheet; the lead sheet was folded and placed onto
        a 1.5 inch bone ash cupel. The cupel was heated slowly to
        1850[deg.] F. in an electric kiln and maintained at this
        temperature for 30 minutes. The cupel was removed from the kiln
        and cooled. A very pale yellow bead weighing 9.5 grams was
        obtained. A second bead weighing 0.9 grams was made in the same
        manner from a 1 gram sample of dark yellow metal product. The 1
        gram bead was placed in dilute nitric acid (1 part 70% nitric
        acid and 4 parts water) at 45-50[deg.] C. for about 60 minutes.
        The bead dissolved to give only about 5 milligrams of black
        sponge. The addition of sodium chloride to the nitric acid
        solution gave a thick white precipitate of silver chloride. The
        HP 4500 ICP-MS showed only silver in the nitric acid solution.<br>

        inside dimensions of 9 inch wide, 10 inch deep and 6.5 inches
        high. Three small holes were drilled into a wall of the kiln.
        The ends of the coiled aluminum tube are placed into two of the
        holes. A temperature probe connected to a model #210 J-KEM
        Scientific temperature controller was inserted into the third
        hole. One end of the aluminum tube is connected to a 4 psi air
