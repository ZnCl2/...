            engine and his engine that has comparable power output:</i>

      <p>The MYT (Massive Yet Tiny) Engine is an internal combustion
        engine of new design the features multiple firings in one cycle,
        producing enormous torque in a small area. </p>
      <p>With 40 times higher power to weight ratio, low parts count,
        low maintenance, high mechanical efficiency, and low pollution,
        the MYT™ Engine will benefit airplane, big ship, 18 wheeler,
        SUV, passenger car, even down to carry on power generator
        applications. The MYT™ Engine as a pump/compressor also exceeds
        existing pumps/compressors in providing massive pressure,
        volume, and flow, all in one unit. </p>
      <p>The first prototype model exerts 850 cubic inches of
        displacement even though the size is only 14" diameter by 14"
        long, weighing 150 lbs, compared to 3000 lbs for a comparable
        engine of conventional size capable of that much power output. </p>
      <p>Angel Labs, LLC: http://www.angellabsllc.com/index.html </p>
      <p><b>How it Works ~</b> </p>
      <p>The reason why the MYT Engine is so huge in displacement is
        because of frequent firing. It fires 16 times in one rotation,
        making it equivalent to 32 cylinder, four stroke engine. </p>
      <p>The basic principle is the following. There are two disks each
        connected to four pistons in a toroidal cylinder. The disks
        rotate alternately generating the four stroke principles between
        the pistons. There is no need for valves since the position of
        the pistons allow wide open port to breathe air. </p>
      <p>The part count is less than 25 parts even though it's 32
        cylinder equivalent. (Each piston fires twice during one
        rotation, making total 16 firings in one main shaft rotation.)
        Since only the piston rings touch the cylinder wall (not piston
        skirts), the friction loss is very minimal. (Emhart/NASA
        (http://emhartcontest.com/W2005/mor2005.php?startat=292)) </p>
      <p><b>Prototype ~</b> </p>
      <p>The first prototype model exerts 850 cubic inches of
        displacement even though the size is only 14" diameter by 14"
        long, weighing in 150 lbs. </p>
      <p>The MYT Engine has been tested with fuel and air motoring on
        our Dynamometer. The calculation of the 850 CID is the
        following. CID = pi * radius * radius * stroke * # of pistons
        (firings) = 3.14 * 1.5 * 1.5 * 3.75 * 32 = 848 cubic inches.
        (Emhart/NASA
        (http://emhartcontest.com/W2005/mor2005.php?startat=292)) </p>
      <p>The application of the MYT Engine is in all kinds of
        transportations, automobiles, trucks, airplanes, ships, and
        distributed and stationary power generations. The MYT Engine
        with four more ports also works as air motor, air and liquid
        pump, and air and liquid compressor, with positive displacement,
        high volume, and high flow. </p>

      <p>Raphial Morgado, inventor of the Massive Yet Tiny (MYT) engine
        claims this minuscule 32-cylinder powerplant, just 14 inches in
        diameter and weighing 150 pounds, can crank out 850hp. Is this
        guy a crackpot working out of a garage somewhere, or is he the
        next Thomas Edison? To hear him tell it: </p>
      <p>“The MYT (Massive Yet Tiny) Engine, is a breakthrough of
        immense proportions that will spawn the next industrial
        revolution and will rocket the internal combustion engine into
        the next milenium. Please spread the word.” </p>
      <p>Can a man who can’t spell the word “millennium” change the
        world? We want to see this baby mounted up in the engine
        compartment of a truck and chugging down the highway, not
        hand-cranked on a bench. Morgado says the MYT engine will
        someday power 800-passenger jumbo jets. Is this one of those
        inventions the oil companies don’t want us to see? </p>

        <p><b><font size="+1">"The 'Massive Yet Tiny' Engine Promises
              Big Power in a Small Package</font></b> </p>
        <p>(Posted Apr 24th 2006 10:57AM by Eric Bryant)</p>
      </center>
      <p>An outfit called Angel Labs has come up with the Massive Yet
        Tiny (MYT) engine, an innovative internal-combustion
        configuration that it claims "will spawn the next industrial
        revolution." Um, okay... so exactly what is it that inspires
        such hyperbole? Keep reading, as we'll try to find out. </p>
      <p>To start, let's examine the operating principle. The MYT uses a
        single toroidal cylinder/combustion chamber, in which rides a
        total of eight "pistons," arranged in two pairs of four each.
        Located at the periphery is a set of two intake and exhaust
        ports (each located 180 degrees from each other), with two spark
        devices also located 180 apart ,and clocked 90 degrees relative
        to the ports. The two pairs of pistons use indexed motion to
        provide the typical four strokes of combustion. Confused? Just
        check out the animation. </p>
      <p>The system packs a large amount of displacement and combustion
        cycles into a small package, which means that the engine looks
        to be capable of producing incredible power for its size - hence
        the name. The engine produces that power by providing large
        amounts of torque at a very low speed, which has the potential
        to significantly reduce drivetrain complexity. </p>
      <p>There appear to be some significant issues that could stand
        between it and mass production, however. First, forming the
        toroidal "cylinder" doesn't look to be a trivial task, as the
        toroid must be split in two to allow for engine. Getting the two
        halves to form a perfect circular cross-section would seem to be
        quite a feat. There's also the issue of producing the indexed
        motion of the two piston pairs, which is certainly not a
        straightforward affair. Combine this with the claimed output
        torque of over 800 ft-lbs., and we see a potential durability
        problem. </p>
      <p>The size of the engine also yields its own problem, in that
        there does not appear to be sufficient material to support the
        type of output that the inventors claim. There are good reasons
        that every other engine appears monstrous in comparison to the
        MYT, and we don't think it's because current engine designers
        lack an understanding of material characteristics. It's not just
        important to understand the ultimate strength of the material
        and construction something to withstand a single cycle, but
        fatigue must also be accounted for in any design that's expected
        to withstand literally billions of cycles. While there are
        several high-strength materials that may be able to provide
        adequate strength, they are typically not used in
        internal-combustion applications. Then there's the matter of
        lubrication and cooling, both of which seem problematic given
        the "cylinder" configuration. </p>
      <p>None of this commentary is intended to disparage the work that
        Raphial Morgado and his team have put into this engine, of
        course. We here at Autoblog prefer to take an optimistic view of
        the internal combustion engine's future. Certainly, we'll all
        benefit if indeed Morgado can make his invention work in a
        cost-effective manner that allows it to be brought to market. </p>

      <p><b>Description: </b>The MYT (Massive Yet Tiny) Engine is a
        revolutionary internal combustion engine for the next millenium.
        The first prototype model exerts 850 cubic inches of
        displacement even though the size is only 14" diameter by 14"
        long, weighing in 150 lbs. The reason why the MYT Engine is so
        huge in displacement is because of frequent firing. It fires 16
        times in one rotation, making it equivalent to 32 cylinder, four
        stroke engine. We received US Patent #6739307, and announced the
        birth of the MYT Engine to public during the SEMA Show last week
        in Las Vegas. The basic principle is the following. There are
        two disks each connected to four pistons in a toroidal cylinder.
        The disks rotate alternately generating the four stroke
        principles between the pistons. There is no need for valves
        since the position of the pistons allow wide open port to

        than 25 parts even though it's 32 cylinder equivalent. (Each
        piston fires twice during one rotation, making total 16 firings
        in one main shaft rotation.) Since only the piston rings touch
        the cylinder wall (not piston skirts), the friction loss is very
        minimal. Sized os 2" up to 5' model has been designed. For
        example, 4.5" model features 2.4 litre cibic inches displacement
        (size of Formula 1 racing engine) weighing only 35 lbs. We, at
        Angel Labs, LLC, do firmly believe that the MYT Engine can spawn
        the next industrial revolution. </p>

      <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p><b>1. Field of Invention</b> </p>
      <p>This invention pertains generally to machines such as engines,
        pumps, and the like and, more particularly, to a positive
        displacement internal combustion engine and method. </p>
      <p><b>2. Related Art</b> </p>
      <p>For more than a century, internal combustion engines have been
        relied upon a principal source of power in a variety of
        applications. Of those engines, the most widely used are the
        reciprocating piston engines which are found in automobiles and
        other forms of transportation, as well as in a variety of
        industrial and consumer applications. Such engines can be built
        in a variety of sizes, depending upon the power requirements of
        a particular application, ranging from a single cylinder up to
        32 cylinders or more. Other types of internal combustion engines
        such as rotary engines and internally combusted turbines are
        also used in a number of applications, but not as widely as the
        reciprocating piston engines. </p>
      <p>Smaller internal combustion engines, including the ones used in
        most automobiles, are powered by gasoline. However, diesel
        engines are also used in some automobiles, although they are
        more commonly found in larger applications such as locomotives
        and ships. </p>
      <p>All of these engines have certain limitations and
        disadvantages. In reciprocating piston engines, the pistons must
        stop and reverse direction four times per revolution of the
        output shaft in a 4-stroke engine and two times per output shaft
        revolution in a 2-stroke engine. Those engines also require
        rather complex valve systems in order to get the fuel mixture
        and the exhaust gases into and out of the combustion chambers at
        the proper times. </p>
      <p>Rotary engines such as the Wankel engine (U.S. Pat. No.
        2,988,065) avoid the problem of piston stoppage and reversal,
        and in addition can provide one power stroke for each revolution
        of the rotor and shaft, whereas a 4-stroke reciprocating piston
        engine which has only one power stroke for every two revolutions
        of the shaft. Notwithstanding those advantages, however, rotary
        engines have found only limited use due to poor fuel economy,
        short operating life, and dirty exhaust. </p>
      <p><b>OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>It is in general an object of the invention to provide a new
        and improved internal combustion engine and method. </p>
      <p>Another object of the invention is to provide an internal
        combustion engine and method of the above character which
        overcome the limitations and disadvantages of the prior art. </p>
      <p>Another object of the invention is to provide an internal
        combustion engine and method of the above character which
        provide significantly more power strokes per shaft rotation than
        reciprocating piston engines and rotary engines heretofore
        provided. </p>
      <p>Another object of the invention is to provide an internal
        combustion engine and method of the above character which
        provide a large displacement in a small space. </p>
      <p>These and other objects are achieved in accordance with the
        invention by providing an internal combustion engine and method
        in which pistons on different rotors move relative to each other
        to form chambers of variable volume in a toroidal cylinder. The
        pistons move in stepwise fashion, with the pistons on one rotor
        travelling a predetermined distance while the pistons on the
        other rotor remain substantially stationary. Fuel is drawn into
        a chamber as one of the pistons defining the chamber moves away
        from the other, and then compressed as the second piston moves
        toward the first. Combustion of the fuel drives the first piston
        away from the second, and the spent gases are then expelled from
        the chamber by the second piston moving again toward the first.
      </p>
      <p>The rotors are connected to an output shaft in such manner that
        the shaft rotates continuously as the pistons and rotors turn in
        their stepwise fashion to provide smooth, continuous power. In
        the embodiments disclosed, a pair of crankshafts are mounted on
        a carrier affixed to the shaft, and rotated continuously about
        their axes by connecting rods connected to cranks which turn
        with the rotors. Gears on the crankshafts transfer this
        continuous rotation to carrier and shaft as they travel about a
        sun gear disposed coaxially of the shaft. </p>
      <p>With four pistons on each rotor and a 4:1 ratio between the sun
        and crankshaft gears, eight chambers are formed between the
        pistons, and there are two power strokes in each of those
        chambers for each revolution of the output shaft. In two shaft
        revolutions, there are 32 power strokes, which is equivalent to
        having 32 cylinders in a conventional 4-stroke engine. </p>

      <p><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b> </p>
      <p>As illustrated in FIGS. 1-3, the engine has a pair of rotors
        21, 22 with pistons 23, 24 which are spaced circumferentially of
        the rotors and disposed within a toroidal chamber or cylinder
        26. The pistons on the two rotors are interposed between each
        other around the cylinder, with chambers 27 being formed between
        successive pistons on the two rotors. As discussed more fully
        hereinafter, the two rotors turn alternately and in stepwise
        fashion, with the pistons on one rotor remaining substantially
        stationary while the pistons on the other advance. Chambers 27
        vary in volume as the pistons advance, with the chambers on the
        back sides of the moving pistons increasing in volume and the
        chambers on the front sides decreasing. With the alternating
        movement of the rotors, chambers which increase in volume during
        one step will decrease during the next. </p>
      <p>Fuel is introduced into the chambers through intake ports 28,
        and spent gases are expelled through exhaust ports 29. The ports
        are arranged in pairs around the cylinder, with two pairs of
        ports being positioned directly opposite each other in the
        embodiment illustrated. The ports communicate openly and
        directly with the cylinder. </p>
      <p>An output shaft 31 extends coaxially of the cylinder and is
        driven in continuous rotation by the pistons and rotors. Rotor
        22 is affixed by a splined connection to a first hollow shaft or
        sleeve 32 which is rotatively mounted on the output shaft, and
        rotor 21 is similarly affixed to a second hollow shaft or sleeve
        33 which is rotatively mounted on the first. Crank arms 34, 36
        are affixed by splines to the other ends of hollow shafts 32, 33
        for movement in concert with rotors 21, 22, respectively. </p>
      <p>A carrier or carriage 37 is affixed to the output shaft by a
        splined connection, and a pair of crankshafts 38, 39 are
        rotatively mounted on the carrier at equal distances from the
        axis of the output shaft. Planet gears 41 are provided at the
        ends of the crankshafts, and they mesh with a sun gear 42 which
        is mounted in a fixed position coaxially of the output shaft.
        The ratio of the sun and planet gears is preferably the same as
        the number of pistons on each of the rotors, i.e. n:1, where n
        is the number of pistons on each rotor. In the embodiment of
        FIG. 1, there are four pistons on each rotor, and the gear ratio
        is 4:1. With that ratio, the steps which the pistons make are
        approximately 90 degrees each, and each of the pistons makes
        four such steps for each revolution of the output shaft. </p>
      <p>Different numbers of pistons and different gear ratios can, of
        course, be used although the number of pistons per rotor and the
        gear ratio should preferably be the same, i.e. n pistons per
        rotor and a gear ratio of n:1. With more pistons and a higher
        ratio, the piston steps decrease in size and increase in number,
        and with fewer pistons and a lower gear ratio, the steps
        increase in size and decrease in number. Thus, for example, with
        eight pistons per rotor and a gear ratio of 8:1, each piston
        would make eight steps of 45 degrees each for each rotation of
        the output shaft. With two pistons per rotor and a ratio of 2:1,
        the pistons would make only two steps of 180 degrees each.
        Stated otherwise, a gear ratio of n:1 provides n steps per
        rotation, with n steps of 360.degree. /n each. </p>
      <p>The crank arms and crankshafts have crank pins 43, 44, which
        are connected together by connecting rods 46, 47. The throw of
        the crankshafts is less than that of the crank arms, which
        enables the crankshafts to rotate continuously even though the
        pistons and rotors do not. </p>
      <p>The relationship between the stepwise movement of the rotors
        and pistons and the continuous rotation of the output shaft is
        further illustrated in FIGS. 4A-4E. In these figures, the
        following designations are used: </p>
      <p>Sun Gear S Crankshafts CS1, CS2 Crank Pins P1, P2 Planet Gears
        G1, G2 Crank Arms CA1, CA2 Connecting Rods R1, R2 </p>
      <p>It is assumed that the gear ratio is 4:1, that crankshaft CS1
        starts in a bottom dead center (BDC) position, and that
        crankshaft CS2 starts at top dead center (TDC). In those
        positions, the crank pins on crankshafts and crank arms are
        aligned on straight lines which pass through the axes of the
        crankshafts. In the TDC position, the crank pin is positioned
        between the crank arm and the axis of the crankshaft, and the
        crank arm is in its most advanced position, i.e., farthest from
        the crankshaft axis. In the BDC position, the crank pin is
        positioned beyond the axis of the crankshaft, and the crank arm
        is in its least advanced position closer to the crankshaft axis.
      </p>
      <p>Being mounted on a carrier which is affixed to the output
        shaft, the crankshafts and planet gears rotate about the axis of
        the output shaft in concert with the output shaft. As the planet
        gears travel around the sun gear, they rotate the crankshafts
        continuously about their axes, with the crankshafts and planet
        gears making one revolution for each 90 degrees of output shaft
        rotation. </p>
      <p>After 22.5 degrees of output shaft rotation, the crankshafts
        and planet gears will have rotated to the positions shown in
        FIG. 4B. At this point, in addition to having travelled 22.5
        degrees around the sun gear, the crankshafts and planet gears
        have also rotated 90 degrees about their own axes. The net
        travel of crank pins P1, P2 is the sum of their travel due to
        these two rotations. </p>
      <p>Since the travel of crank pin P1 due to rotation of planet gear
        G1 about its own axis is in the same direction as the travel of
        planet gear G1 about the sun gear, these two components of
        travel add together to move crank arm CA1 toward its advanced
        position. </p>
      <p>During this portion of the cycle, however, the travel of crank
        pin P2 due to rotation of planet gear G2 about its own axis is
        opposite to the direction in which the planet gear is travelling
        about the sun gear. As a result, these two components of travel
        offset each other, and crank arm CA2 remains substantially
        stationary in its original position. </p>
      <p>During the next 22.5 degrees of shaft rotation, the crankshafts
        and planet gears travel another 22.5 degrees about the sun gear
        and rotate another 90 degrees about their own axes to the
        positions shown in FIG. 4C, bringing crankshafts CS1, CS2 to
        their TDC and BDC positions, respectively. During this portion
        of the cycle, the travel of crank pin P1 due to rotation of the
        crankshaft and planet gear continues to be in the same direction
        as the travel around the sun gear, and crank arm CA1 is advanced
        to its most advanced position. The rotational travel of crank
        pin CP2 about the crankshaft axis is still opposite to the
        travel about the sun gear, and these two components continue to
        offset each other, with crank arm CA2 remaining substantially
        stationary. </p>
      <p>Once crankshaft CS1 has reached TDC, the rotational travel of
        crank pin P2 about the crankshaft axis is in the same direction
        as the travel about the sun gear, and the two components add
        together, with crank arm CA2 beginning to advance. Now, however,
        the rotational travel of crank pin CA1 about its crankshaft axis
        is opposite to the direction of travel about the sun gear, and
        these two components of travel offset each other, with crank arm
        CA1 remaining substantially stationary. After 22.5 degrees of
        shaft rotation, the gears will have reached the positions shown
        in FIG. 4D. </p>
      <p>During the next 22.5 degrees of shaft rotation, the crankshafts
        and planet gears will rotate another 90 degrees about their own
        axes and will travel another 22.5 degrees around the sun gear to
        the positions shown in FIG. 4E. In this part of the cycle, the
        rotational travel of crank pin CP2 is still in the same
        direction as its travel about the sun gear, and the two
        components continue to combine and advance crank arm CA2. The
        rotational travel of crank pin P1 continues to be opposite to
        its travel about the sun gear, and these two components continue
        to offset each other, with crank arm CA1 remaining substantially
        stationary. </p>
      <p>At this point, the crankshafts and planet gears have rotated a
        full 360 degrees about their own axes, they have travelled 90
        degrees around the sun gear, and the output shaft has rotated 90
        degrees about its axis. The crank arms have also advanced 90
        degrees, but in stepwise fashion, as have the pistons and rotors
        which are connected to them. This cycle repeats four times for
        each revolution of the output shaft. </p>
      <p>Since the output shaft and the rotors are connected together by
        the connecting rods, they rotate together at the same overall
        rate, with the rotors making a total of one revolution for each
        revolution of the output shaft. However, due to the action of
        the crankshaft and the crank arms, the rotors also, in effect,
        rock back and forth as they rotate with the output shaft,
        producing the stepwise rotation. </p>
      <p>Since the movement of the crank arms is constrained in part by
        the circular motion of the crank pins on the crankshaft, the
        movement of the crank arms and rotors is not linear. It is the
        slowest when the crankshafts are near TDC and BDC and the
        circular movement is roughly perpendicular to the connecting rod
        axes, and it is the fastest when the crankshafts are about
        midway between TDC and BDC and the circular movement is aligned
        more closely with rod axes. This nonlinearity results in about 9
        degrees of carry through duration which enables the pistons on
        both rotors to come to rest in substantially the same positions
        between the intake and exhaust ports at different times. </p>
      <p>The relationship between piston travel and output shaft
        rotation is illustrated more empirically in FIG. 5. The data in
        this table was obtained by measurements made on a prototype
        engine having a gear ratio of 4:1. In this example, the cycle
        starts with a crankshaft at BDC (0.degree.), and a piston on the
        rotor connected to that crankshaft at a zero degree (0.degree.)
        reference point. </p>
      <p>This data shows that as the output shaft rotates from 10
        degrees to 40 degrees, the net piston travel is only 2.5
        degrees, and that during the time the piston moves from 15
        degrees to 35 degrees, the net piston movement is zero, with the
        piston actually backing up a small amount as the shaft moves
        from 25 degrees to 30 degrees. When the shaft reaches the 40
        degree point, the piston starts to move more rapidly, going from
        12.5 degrees to 90 degrees as the shaft goes from 40 degrees to
        90 degrees. For shaft positions between 50 degrees and 85
        degrees, the piston travels about 8 to 10 degrees for each 5
        degrees of shaft rotation, slowing down again to about the same
        speed as the shaft when the shaft reaches 85 degrees. Throughout
        the cycle, the output shaft and the crankshaft rotate
        continuously and evenly as indicated by the regular intervals in
        their movement. </p>
      <p>The offsetting movements of the crankshafts as they rotate
        about their own axes and travel about the sun gear effectively
        lock the rotors and pistons in their substantially stationary
        positions. While one rotor and the pistons on it are locked, the
        other rotor and the pistons on it are free to advance. Thus,
        when combustion occurs, the locked rotor remains substantially
        stationary, and the pistons on the other rotor are driven ahead
        with the full force of the expanding gases. The movement of that
        rotor drives the crankshaft connected to it, and the rotation of
        the crankshaft causes the planet gear on that crankshaft to
        travel around the sun gear, rotating the output shaft affixed to
        the carrier as it does so. On the next power stroke which begins
        almost immediately, the other rotor is driven, and the
        crankshaft connected to that rotor drives the output shaft. The
        shaft turns continuously, receiving 16 power strokes for every
        360 degrees of rotation. </p>
      <p>The stepwise movement and locking of the rotors is achieved
        with no interruption or reversal in rotation of the crankshafts,
        gears and output shaft. This is a major improvement over
        conventional engines in which the pistons must stop and reverse
        direction two times for each rotation of the output shaft and
        four times for each power stroke. </p>
      <p>The rotors can be set to bring the confronting faces of the
        pistons very close together at the beginning and end of each
        stroke, and the engine can have a very high compression ratio,
        e.g. 35:1 or higher. As a result, the engine can be operated in
        a diesel mode, with no spark plugs or ignition wiring and
        timing. However, if desired, it can also be operated on gasoline
        or another fuel requiring a spark for combustion, in which case
        a suitable ignition system can be employed. </p>
      <p>The engine operates in a 4-stroke cycle which is illustrated
        diagrammatically in FIGS. 6A-6I, and with the pistons on the two
        rotors being designated A1, B1, etc. At the start of the cycle,
        the rotors are in the positions shown in FIG. 6A, with pistons
        B1 and B3 forming a seal between intake ports 28 and exhaust
        ports 29. In these figures, the intake and exhaust ports are
        represented by arrows labeled IN and EX, respectively. </p>
      <p>During the first 45 degrees of shaft rotation, the pistons on
        rotor A advance approximately 90 degrees to the positions shown
        in FIG. 6B, with the pistons on rotor B remaining substantially
        stationary. As the pistons on rotor A advance, the chambers
        formed between pistons A1, B1 and A3, B3 go through an intake
        stroke, increasing in volume, and drawing the fuel mixture into
        themselves through intake ports 28. </p>
      <p>During the next 45 degrees of shaft rotation, the pistons on
        rotor B advance approximately 90 degrees to the positions shown
        in FIG. 6C, with the pistons on rotor A remaining substantially
        stationary. As the pistons on rotor B advance, the chambers
        between pistons A1, B1 and A3, B3 go through a compression
        stroke, decreasing in volume and compressing the fuel mixture in
        them. </p>
      <p>Compression of the fuel mixture raises its temperature to the
        point of ignition, and the resulting combustion causes chambers
        between pistons A1, B1 and A3, B3 to increase in volume, with
        rotor B remaining substantially stationary and rotor A advancing
        another 90 degrees to the position shown in FIG. 6D. During this
        power stroke, the output shaft rotates another 45 degrees. </p>
      <p>During the next 45 degrees of shaft rotation, the pistons on
        rotor B advance approximately 90 degrees to the positions shown
        in FIG. 6E, with the pistons on rotor A remaining substantially
        stationary and A1, A3 forming seals between the intake ports and
        the exhaust ports. As the pistons on rotor B advance, the
        chambers between pistons A1, B1 and A3, B3 decrease in volume,
        expelling the spent combustion gases through exhaust ports 29. </p>
      <p>Following the exhaust stroke, the cycle repeats, and the
        chambers between pistons A1, B1 and A3, B3 go through another
        intake stroke, with the pistons on rotor A advancing to the
        positions shown in FIG. 6F. During the next 45 degrees of shaft
        rotation, the pistons on rotor B advance to the positions shown
        in FIG. 6G, compressing the fuel mixture in these chambers.
        Combustion of the compressed fuel mixture drives the pistons on
        rotor A to the positions shown in FIG. 6H, with the output shaft
        advancing another 45 degrees. During the next 45 degrees of
        shaft rotation, the pistons on rotor B advance to the positions
        shown in FIG. 6I, expelling the spent gases and completing the
        cycle. The pistons and the shaft have now completed 360 degrees
        of rotation, and the pistons are back in the positions shown in
        FIG. 6A, ready for the next cycle. </p>
      <p>At the same time the chambers formed between pistons A1, B1 and
        A3, B3 are going through their operating cycle, similar cycles
        are also occurring in the chambers formed between the other
        pistons. Thus, for example, as rotor A moves between the
        positions shown in FIGS. 6A and 6B and an intake stroke is
        occurring in the chambers between pistons A1, B1 and A3, B3,
        compression strokes are occurring in the chambers between
        pistons A1, B2 and A3, B4, power strokes are occurring in the
        chambers between pistons A2, B2 and A4, B4, and exhaust strokes
        are occurring in the chambers between pistons A2, B3 and A4, B1.
      </p>
      <p>FIG. 7 shows the strokes occurring in the chambers in 360
        degrees of shaft rotation. From this chart, it will be seen that
        the engine goes through two complete cycles of operation in each
        one of the eight chambers during each revolution of the output
        shaft. Thus, there are two power strokes in each chamber, and in
        two revolutions of the output shaft, there are a total of 32
        power strokes in the eight chambers, which is equivalent to a 32
        cylinder engine of conventional design. </p>
      <p>With working chambers that rotate and share the same space in
        the toroidal cylinder, the engine achieves a remarkably high
        displacement in a relatively small space. In one present
        embodiment, for example, the toroidal cylinder has an outer
        diameter of 11.25 inches, and each chamber has a diameter of 3.0
        inches and a stroke of 3.75 inches, with a total effective
        displacement of 424 cubic inches in one revolution of the output
        shaft. With two revolutions of the shaft as in a conventional
        4-stroke engine, the engine has an effective displacement of
        almost 850 cubic inches. When constructed of high strength,
        lightweight materials, the engine has an overall diameter and
        length of about 14 inches each, and a weight of about 200
        pounds. This is a very substantial and significant improvement
        over a conventional 6-cylinder inline engine of comparable
        displacement, which typically would have a length of about 5
        feet, a width of about 2 feet, a height of about 4 feet and
        weight of about 2500 pounds. </p>
      <p>Also, the power output is substantially greater than that of a
        conventional engine of comparable displacement. The 850 cubic
        inch displacement (C.I.D.) engine described above is believed to
        be capable of putting out 2000 horsepower, or more, whereas a
        conventional 850 C.I.D. typically would put out no more than
        about 400 horsepower. </p>
      <p>FIGS. 8-15 illustrate a presently preferred embodiment in which
        the engine is constructed in a cylindrical housing 51 that
        includes a central section 52 and end covers 53, 54, with
        cooling fins on the exterior of all three sections. One end of
        the housing serves as an engine block 55, and the other houses a
        crankcase. In the block, circular recesses 56, 57 of
        semicircular cross section are formed in the confronting faces
        of central section 52 and cover 53 to form a toroidal chamber or
        cylinder 58 for the pistons. Radial bores 59, 61 open through
        the confronting faces and join together to form the intake and
        exhaust ports. Ring bridges (not shown) span the ports to
        prevent damage to the piston rings as they travel past the
        ports. </p>
      <p>An output shaft 63 extends coaxially of the housing and
        projects from the two end covers for connection to other
        devices. At one end, the shaft has external splines 64, and at
        the other end it has corresponding internal splines 66 and an
        annular coupling flange 67. These splines permit two or more of
        the engines to be readily connected together, or staged, if
        desired. </p>
      <p>A pair of rotors 68, 69 with circumferentially spaced vane-like
        pistons 71, 72 are disposed coaxially of the output shaft, with
        the pistons on the two rotors being interposed between each
        other around cylinder 58. In this embodiment, the rotors and
        pistons are formed as unitary structures. The pistons are
        circular in cross section, and have radial faces 73, 74 on
        opposite sides thereof which intercept an angle of approximately
        9 degrees. The rotors have disk-like bodies 68a, 69a, with
        concavely curved peripheral surfaces 68b, 69b which match the
        curvature of recesses 56, 57 and serve as part of the cylinder
        wall. </p>
      <p>A seal between the two rotors is provided by a ring 76 in
        annular grooves 68c, 69c in the inner faces of the rotor disks.
        Seals between the rotors and the block are provided by rings 77
        in annular grooves 68d, 69d in the outer faces of the rotors and
        the faces of housing section 52 and end cover 53. The pistons
        have peripheral ring grooves and rings 70 which seal against the
        wall of the cylinder. </p>
      <p>If as in the preferred embodiments, the pistons and cylinder
        are circular in cross section, conventional piston rings can be
        used. However, the pistons and cylinder do not have to be
        circular, and they can have any other cross-sectional contour
        desired, including rectangular and trapezoidal. </p>
      <p>The rotors are connected to crank arms 78, 79 in the crankcase
        by hollow shafts or sleeves 81, 82 which are similar to hollow
        shafts 32, 33 in the embodiment of FIGS. 1-3. These shafts are
        disposed coaxially of output shaft 63, with the inner hollow 81
        shaft being rotatively mounted on the output shaft, and outer
        hollow shaft 82 being rotatively mounted on the inner one. The
        inner hollow shaft is somewhat longer than the outer one, and
        rotor 68 and crank arm 78 are affixed to the ends of the outer
        shaft by splines 83. Rotor 69 and crank arm 79 are likewise
        affixed to the projecting ends of the inner shaft by splines 84.
      </p>
      <p>Each of the crank arms has two generally radial arms 78a, 78b
        and 79a, 79b, only one of which is affixed to the hollow shaft.
        The other arms are rotatively mounted on the output shaft for
        added strength and stability, with crank pins 78c, 79c extending
        between the two arms of each crank. </p>
      <p>A carriage or carrier 86 is affixed to output shaft 63 by
        splines 87, and a pair of crankshafts 88, 89 are rotatively
        mounted on the carrier in diametrically opposite positions. The
        crankshafts have planet gears 88a, 89a which are formed as an
        integral part of the crankshafts and mesh with sun gears 91, 92
        which are affixed to the housing and disposed coaxially of shaft
        63. The crankshafts also have eccentric which are connected to
        crank pins 78c, 79c on the crank arms by connecting rods 93, 94.
      </p>
      <p>Operation and use of this embodiment is similar to that
        described above. With four pistons per rotor and a gear ratio of
        4:1, this engine also fires 16 times per revolution of the
        output shaft and 32 times in two revolutions. As noted above, it
        can deliver upwards of 2000 horsepower from a package measuring
        only 14 inches in diameter and 14 inches in length, and weighing
        only about 200 pounds. </p>
      <p>If desired, a second stage can be added to the engine of FIGS.
        8-15 by adding a second toroidal cylinder to the outboard end of
        the crankcase and coupling the rotors and pistons in that
        cylinder to the existing drive mechanism. That is done by
        extending output shaft 63 through the added cylinder and
        mounting an additional pair of hollow shafts on the extended
        portion of the drive shaft, with one end of the hollow shafts
        being splined to the free arms 78b, 79b of the crank arms, and
        the other ends being splined to the added rotors. When this is
        done, a single drive mechanism serves the pistons in two
        cylinders, and the power of the engine can be doubled without
        also doubling the size of the engine. </p>
      <p>The engine runs very efficiently and can use a variety of
        alternate fuels as well as diesel fuel and gasoline. It can also
        be used as an incinerator for burning garbage which has been
        liquefied and combined with another fuel, with up to about 70
        percent of the mixture being garbage. It can also be constructed
        as a micro engine, and used for applications such as charging
        battery power packs. </p>
      <p>The engine can also be configured for use as a pump by
        rearranging the ports and driving the output shaft. For a pump,
        the number of ports is preferably made equal to the number of
        pistons on the rotors. Thus, for example, with four pistons per
        rotor, four pairs of inlet and outlet ports are spaced equally
        around the cylinder. As illustrated in FIGS. 16 and 17 each time
        a piston advances, it draws fluid into the chamber behind it and
        discharges fluid from the chamber in front of it. This results
        in a pump which is capable of high volume, high flow and high
        pressure, all in one compact unit. </p>
      <p>If desired, the pump can be staged with the engine of FIGS.
        8-15, with a single drive mechanism being used for both. </p>
      <p>The invention has a number of important features and
        advantages. It provides a very compact and highly efficient
        engine which can be used in a variety of applications, both
        large and small, it can burn a variety of fuels and can be
        operated either in a diesel mode or with a spark ignition. In
        automotive applications, the high burning efficiency and large
        displacement provide both very high fuel mileage and high power.
        The engine has very few parts, and its design is both simple and
        elegant. It can also be configured as a pump without changing
        the basic mechanism. </p>
      <p>It is apparent from the foregoing that a new and improved
        internal combustion engine and method have been provided. While
        only certain presently preferred embodiments have been described
        in detail, as will be apparent to those familiar with the art,
        certain changes and modifications can be made without departing
        from the scope of the invention as defined by the following
        claims. </p>
