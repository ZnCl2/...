      Dr. Persinger's work is primarily published in peer-reviewed
      academic journals devoted to neuroscience and cognitive studies.
      Persinger does not reject the validity of spiritual and psychic
      experiences. His many papers and experiments offer specific
      mechanisms for how the brain can create them subjectively. Proof
      that God is in the brain means that the power of prayer lies in
      the human mind. Meditation works by making changes in the brain.
      The kingdom of heaven lies within the complexities of the brain,
      the most complex object known to science. This field of inquiry
      has been called neurotheology by several authors and journalists,
      though it's members usually have other names for themselves.<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Persinger uses concepts like "vectorial hemisphericity",
      "interhemispheric intrusions", "linguistic sense of self", "neural
      intercalation", and several others that are difficult to
      understand without serious study. These pages should make it
      easier to understand Dr. Persinger's most important concept, that
      spiritual and religious experience, as well as spiritual
      personalities can be understood by looking at the brains function.
      Many of the ideas explored in these pages are not those of Dr.
      Persinger, but those of the author. In any event, The articles on
      these pages provide an easy to read introduction to neurotheology;
      Thinking about spirituality and spiritual experiences in terms of
      brain activity.<br>

      Shakti uses magnetic fields to create altered states. These carry
      signals derived from the human brain. These allow it to 'target'
      specific brain structures known to be involved with spirituality
      and to induce altered states of consciousness.<br>
      <br>
      Shakti signals are magnetic fields that rise and fall in patterns
      the brain responds to. These fields are no stronger than the ones
      from a phone receiver or hair dryer. <br>

      "How does Dr. Persinger artificially induce religious experiences
      in his patients?"<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Persinger has designed a helmet that produces a very weak
      rotating magnetic field of between ten nanotesla and one
      microtesla over the temporal lobes of the brain. This is placed on
      the subject's head and they are placed in a quiet chamber while
      blindfolded. So that there is no risk of 'suggestion', the only
      information that the subjects are given is that they are going in
      for a relaxation experiment. Neither the subject nor the
      experimenter carrying out the test has any idea of the true
      purpose of the experiment. In addition to this, the experiment is
      also run with the field switched both off and on. This procedure
      Dr. Persinger claims will induce an experience in over 80% of test
      subjects." <br>

      <br>
      Michael Persinger has a vision - the Almighty isn't dead, he's an
      energy field. And your mind is an electromagnetic map to your
      soul.<br>
      <br>
      Over a scratchy speaker, a researcher announces, "Jack, one of
      your electrodes is loose, we're coming in." The 500-pound steel
      door of the experimental chamber opens with a heavy whoosh; two
      technicians wearing white lab coats march in. They remove the
      Ping-Pong-ball halves taped over my eyes and carefully lift a
      yellow motorcycle helmet that's been retrofitted with
      electromagnetic field-emitting solenoids on the sides, aimed
      directly at my temples. Above the left hemisphere of my
      42-year-old male brain, they locate the dangling electrode, needed
      to measure and track my brain waves. The researchers slather more
      conducting cream into the graying wisps of my red hair and press
      the securing tape hard into my scalp.<br>
      <br>
      After restoring everything to its proper working position, the
      techies exit, and I'm left sitting inside the utterly silent,
      utterly black vault. A few commands are typed into a computer
      outside the chamber, and selected electromagnetic fields begin
      gently thrumming my brain's temporal lobes. The fields are no more
      intense than what you'd get as by-product from an ordinary
      blow-dryer, but what's coming is anything but ordinary. My lobes
      are about to be bathed with precise wavelength patterns that are
      supposed to affect my mind in a stunning way, artificially
      inducing the sensation that I am seeing God.<br>
      <br>
      I'm taking part in a vanguard experiment on the physical sources
      of spiritual consciousness, the current work-in-progress of
      Michael Persinger, a neuropsychologist at Canada's Laurentian
      University in Sudbury, Ontario. His theory is that the sensation
      described as "having a religious experience" is merely a side
      effect of our bicameral brain's feverish activities. Simplified
      considerably, the idea goes like so: When the right hemisphere of
      the brain, the seat of emotion, is stimulated in the cerebral
      region presumed to control notions of self, and then the left
      hemisphere, the seat of language, is called upon to make sense of
      this nonexistent entity, the mind generates a "sensed presence."<br>
      <br>
      Persinger has tickled the temporal lobes of more than 900 people
      before me and has concluded, among other things, that different
      subjects label this ghostly perception with the names that their
      cultures have trained them to use - Elijah, Jesus, the Virgin
      Mary, Mohammed, the Sky Spirit. Some subjects have emerged with
      Freudian interpretations - describing the presence as one's
      grandfather, for instance - while others, agnostics with more than
      a passing faith in UFOs, tell something that sounds more like a
      standard alien-abduction story.<br>
      <br>
      It may seem sacrilegious and presumptuous to reduce God to a few
      ornery synapses, but modern neuroscience isn't shy about defining
      our most sacred notions - love, joy, altruism, pity - as nothing
      more than static from our impressively large cerebrums. Persinger
      goes one step further. His work practically constitutes a Grand
      Unified Theory of the Otherworldly: He believes cerebral fritzing
      is responsible for almost anything one might describe as
      paranormal - aliens, heavenly apparitions, past-life sensations,
      near-death experiences, awareness of the soul, you name it.<br>
      <br>
      To those of us who prefer a little mystery in our lives, it all
      sounds like a letdown. And as I settle in for my mind trip, I'm
      starting to get apprehensive. I'm a lapsed Episcopalian clinging
      to only a hazy sense of the divine, but I don't especially like
      the idea that whatever vestigial faith I have in the Almighty's
      existence might get clinically lobotomized by Persinger's demo. Do
      I really want God to be rendered as explicable and predictable as
      an endorphin rush after a 3-mile run?<br>
      <br>
      The journey from my home in Connecticut to the mining district
      north of Lake Huron is, by modern standards, arduous. Given what's
      in store, it's also strangely fitting. When you think of people
      seeking divine visions, you imagine them trekking to some
      mountainous cloister. The pilgrimage to Persinger's lab is the
      clinical counterpart.<br>
      <br>
      The trip involves flying in increasingly smaller puddle-jumpers
      with increasingly fewer propellers until you land in the ore-rich
      Ontario town of Sudbury, a place that's been battered by commerce,
      geography, and climate. Jags of red rock and black iron erupt from
      the landscape, often bolting right out of the pavement. The
      weather-beaten concrete exteriors of the city's buildings speak of
      long, harsh winters.<br>
      <br>
      A short car ride through stony suburbs ends at a forlorn cluster
      of a dozen buildings: Laurentian University. Near Parking Lot 4, I
      am met by Charles Cook, a grad student of Persinger's. He leads me
      into the science building's basement, then to the windowless
      confines of Room C002B, Persinger's lair.<br>
      <br>
      Waiting there is Linda St-Pierre, another graduate student, who
      prompts me to sit down, then launches into a series of
      psychological questions. I answer a range of true-or-false
      statements from an old version of the Minnesota Multiphasic
      Personality Inventory, a test designed to ferret out any nuttiness
      that might disqualify me from serving as a study subject. When
      read individually, the questions seem harmless, but as a group
      they sound hopelessly antiquated, as if the folks who devised the
      exam hadn't checked the warehouse for anachronisms in five
      decades:<br>
      <br>
      I like to read mechanics magazines.<br>
      Someone is trying to poison me.<br>
      I have successful bowel movements.<br>
      I know who is trying to get me.<br>
      As a child, I enjoyed playing drop-the-handkerchief. <br>
      <br>
      I'm escorted into the chamber, an old sound-experiment booth. The
      tiny room doesn't appear to have been redecorated since it was
      built in the early '70s. The frayed spaghettis of a
      brown-and-white shag carpet, along with huge, wall-mounted
      speakers covered in glittery black nylon, surround a spent brown
      recliner upholstered in the prickly polymers of that time. The
      chair, frankly, is repellent. Hundreds of subjects have settled
      into its itchy embrace, and its brown contours are spotted with
      dollops of electrode-conducting cream, dried like toothpaste,
      giving the seat the look of a favored seagulls' haunt.<br>
      <br>
      In the name of science, I sit down.<br>
      <br>
      Persinger's research forays are at the very frontier of the
      roiling field of neuroscience, the biochemical approach to the
      study of the brain. Much of what we hear about the discipline is
      anatomical stuff, involving the mapping of the brain's many folds
      and networks, performed by reading PET scans, observing blood
      flows, or deducing connections from stroke and accident victims
      who've suffered serious brain damage. But cognitive neuroscience
      is also a grab bag of more theoretical pursuits that can range
      from general consciousness studies to finding the neural basis for
      all kinds of sensations.<br>
      <br>
      As the work piles up, many things that we hold to be unique
      aspects of the "self" are reduced to mere tics of cranial
      function. Take laughter. According to Vilayanur Ramachandran,
      professor of neuroscience at UC San Diego, laughter is just the
      brain's way of signaling that a fearful circumstance is not really
      so worrisome. At a conference earlier this year, he posited that
      the classic banana-peel pratfall is funny only when the victim
      gets up, and that we laugh to alert "other members of [our] kin
      that, 'Look, there has been a false alarm here; don't waste your
      resources rushing to help.'" He calls laughter "nature's OK
      signal."<br>
      <br>
      Of course, this type of deromanticizing has been going on for a
      while - Persinger's brain manipulations have crude antecedents in
      the 1950s, the roaring decade for behaviorism. Back then, Yale
      physiologist Jose Delgado earned national renown by implanting
      electrodes into the brains of live animals and attaching them to a
      "stimoceiver" under the skull. In a technique called ESB -
      electronic stimulation of the brain - Delgado sent radio signals
      through the electrodes to control the animal. In one demonstration
      in the early 1960s, he used his electronic gizmo to halt a
      charging bull.<br>
      <br>
      Delgado's relatively coarse stunts were a long way from
      Persinger's quest for the God spot, but Persinger is not the first
      to theorize that the Creator exists only in the complex landscape
      of the human noggin. In his controversial 1976 book, The Origin of
      Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind, Julian
      Jaynes, a Princeton psychologist, argued that the brain activity
      of ancient people - those living roughly 3,500 years ago, prior to
      early evidence of consciousness such as logic, reason, and ethics
      - would have resembled that of modern schizophrenics. Jaynes
      maintained that, like schizophrenics, the ancients heard voices,
      summoned up visions, and lacked the sense of metaphor and
      individual identity that characterizes a more advanced mind. He
      said that some of these ancestral synaptic leftovers are buried
      deep in the modern brain, which would explain many of our
      present-day sensations of God or spirituality.<br>
      <br>
      Among practicing neuroscientists, there is no overarching
      consensus on whether such notions are correct. Persinger is
      certainly out on a frontier where theory meets the boldest sort of
      speculation, but there's nothing inherently bizarre about his
      methods or the questions he's asking. William Calvin, a professor
      of behavioral sciences at the University of Washington in Seattle,
      says that Persinger's line of inquiry is no more mysterious than
      another pursuit that intrigues neuroscientists: trying to
      understand the sensations of déjà vu or its opposite, jamais vu -
      the feeling, during a familiar routine, that we're doing it for
      the first time. Maybe these feelings, like God, are just more
      fritzing in the electricity arcing about our brains.<br>
      <br>
      Persinger arrives soon after St-Pierre has judged me sane enough
      to enter Room C002B.<br>
      <br>
      "I see that Mr. Cook has been as punctual as usual," he says,
      extending a hand in greeting. Persinger, 54, blends a crisp,
      scientific demeanor with a mischievous smile, but overall he's a
      very serious man. His erect posture is enhanced by a dark,
      pin-striped, three-piece suit with a gold chain swag at the bottom
      of the vest. His sentences are clipped and stripped of any
      vernacular - so painstakingly scientific that they can be coy. For
      example, he tells me that he is actually an American who "moved to
      Canada in July of 1969, because I had a rather major ethical
      disagreement with my government." It takes me a follow-up or two
      before I realize he had dodged the draft.<br>
      <br>
      As the researchers fit my helmet, I ask: Has anyone ever freaked
      out in the chair? Persinger smiles slightly and describes when a
      subject suffered an "adverse experience" and succumbed to an
      "interpretation that the room was hexed." When I ask if, say, the
      subject ripped all this equipment from his flesh and ran screaming
      from the dungeon, Persinger curtly replies: "Yes, his heart rate
      did go up and he did want to leave and of course he could because
      that is part of the protocol."<br>
      <br>
      One more time: Has anyone freaked out in the chair? "His EKG was
      showing that he moved very, very quickly and dramatically,"
      Persinger offers, "and that he was struggling to take off the
      electrodes."<br>
      <br>
      Technically speaking, what's about to happen is simple. Using his
      fixed wavelength patterns of electromagnetic fields, Persinger
      aims to inspire a feeling of a sensed presence - he claims he can
      also zap you with euphoria, anxiety, fear, even sexual stirring.
      Each of these electromagnetic patterns is represented by columns
      of numbers - thousands of them, ranging from 0 to 255 - that
      denote the increments of output for the computer generating the EM
      bursts.<br>
      <br>
      Some of the bursts - which Persinger more precisely calls "a
      series of complex repetitive patterns whose frequency is modified
      variably over time" - have generated their intended effects with
      great regularity, the way aspirin causes pain relief. Persinger
      has started naming them and is creating a sort of EM
      pharmacological dictionary. The pattern that stimulates a sensed
      presence is called the Thomas Pulse, named for Persinger's
      colleague Alex Thomas, who developed it. There's another one
      called Burst X, which reproduces what Persinger describes as a
      sensation of "relaxation and pleasantness."<br>
      <br>
      A new one, the Linda Genetic Pulse, is named for my psychometrist,
      Linda St-Pierre. Persinger says St-Pierre is conducting a massive
      study on rats to determine the ways in which lengthy exposures to
      particular electromagnetic pulses can "affect gene expression."<br>
      <br>
      After spending a little time with Persinger, you get accustomed to
      the fact that his most polite phrases demand pursuit. Affect gene
      expression? It sounds so simple, but what he's really talking
      about is stringing together a number of different electromagnetic
      fields to prompt a complicated chemical reaction on the genetic
      level - for example, directing the body's natural self-healing
      instincts.<br>
      <br>
      "We want to enhance what the brain does to help heal the body,"
      Persinger explains. "Among more sensitive individuals, tests show
      that their skin will turn red if they believe a hot nickel has
      been placed on their hand. That's a powerful psychosomatic effect
      of the brain on the body. Suppose we could make it more precise?"<br>
      <br>
      Persinger envisions a series of EM patterns that work the way
      drugs do. Just as you take an antibiotic and it has a predictable
      result, you might be exposed to precise EM patterns that would
      signal the brain to carry out comparable effects.<br>
      <br>
      Another possible application: Hollywood. Persinger has talked to
      Douglas Trumbull, the special-effects wizard responsible for the
      look of everything from 2001: A Space Odyssey to Brainstorm. They
      discussed the technological possibility of marrying Persinger's
      helmet with virtual reality. "If you've done virtual reality,"
      Persinger says, "then you know that once you put on the helmet,
      you always know you are inside the helmet. The idea is to create a
      form of entertainment that is more real." But he adds, sounding
      like so many people who've gotten a call from the coast, "we
      haven't cut a deal yet."<br>
      <br>
      I am being withdrawn from my body and set adrift in an infinite
      existential emptiness.<br>
      <br>
      Soon enough, it's time for the good professor to wish me well and
      lob this last caveat: "If, for whatever reason, you become
      frightened or want to end the experiment, just speak into your
      lapel microphone."<br>
      <br>
      When the door closes and I feel nothing but the weight of the
      helmet on my head and the Ping-Pong balls on my eyes, I start
      giving serious thought to what it might be like to "see" God,
      artificially produced or not. Nietzsche's last sane moment
      occurred when he saw a carter beating a horse. He beat the carter,
      hugged the horse while sobbing uncontrollably, and was then
      carried away. I can imagine that. I see myself having a powerful
      vision of Jesus, and coming out of the booth wet with tears of
      humility, wailing for mercy from my personal savior.<br>
      <br>
      Instead, after I adjust to the darkness and the cosmic susurrus of
      absolute silence, I drift almost at once into a warm bath of
      oblivion. Something is definitely happening. During the 35-minute
      experiment, I feel a distinct sense of being withdrawn from the
      envelope of my body and set adrift in an infinite existential
      emptiness, a deep sensation of waking slumber. The machines
      outside the chamber report an uninterrupted alertness on my part.
      (If the researchers see the easily recognized EEG pattern of
      sleep, they wake you over the speakers.) Occasionally, I surface
      to an alpha state where I sort of know where I am, but not quite.
      This feeling is cool - like being reinserted into my body. Then
      there's a separation again, of body and soul, and - almost by my
      will - I happily allow myself to drift back to the surprisingly
      bearable lightness of oblivion.<br>
      <br>
      In this floating state, several ancient childhood memories are
      jarred loose. Suddenly, I am sitting with Scott Allen on the rug
      in his Colonial Street house in Charleston, South Carolina, circa
      1965, singing along to "Moon River" and clearly hearing, for the
      first time since then, Scott's infectiously frenzied laughter. I
      reexperience the time I spent the night with Doug Appleby and the
      discomfort I felt at being in a house that was so punctiliously
      clean. (Doug's dad was a doctor.) I also remember seeing Joanna
      Jacobs' small and perfect breasts, unholstered beneath the linen
      gauze of her hippie blouse, circa 1971.<br>
      <br>
      Joanna was my girlfriend when I was 14. When I was sent off to
      boarding school, she and I recorded cassette tapes to one another.
      As a teenager, Joanna was a spiritual woman and talked a lot about
      transcendental meditation. Off at boarding school, I signed up and
      got my mantra from the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, right around the
      time Joanna dropped me to move on to a tougher crowd.<br>
      <br>
      If I had to pin down when I felt this dreamy state before - of
      being in the presence of something divine - it would be back then,
      in the euphoric, romantic hope that animated my adolescent efforts
      at meditation. That soothing feeling of near-sleep has always been
      associ-ated with what I imagined should have happened between
      Joanna Jacobs and me. Like the boy in James Joyce's The Dead,
      Joanna was a perfect memory - all the potential of womanly love
      distilled into the calming mantra-guided drone of fecund rest.<br>
      <br>
      I'm not sure what it says about me that the neural sensation
      designed to prompt visions of God set loose my ancient feelings
      about girls. But then, I'm not the first person to conflate God
      with late-night thoughts of getting laid - read more about it in
      Saint Augustine, Saint John of the Cross, or Deepak Chopra.<br>
      <br>
      So: Something took place. Still, when the helmet comes off and
      they shove a questionnaire in my hand, I feel like a failure. One
      question: Did the red bulb on the wall grow larger or smaller?
      There was a red bulb on the wall? I hadn't noticed. Many other
      questions suggest that there were other experiences I should have
      had, but to be honest, I didn't.<br>
      <br>
      In fact, as transcendental experiences go, on a scale of 1 to 10,
      Persinger's helmet falls somewhere around, oh, 4. Even though I
      did have a fairly convincing out-of-body experience, I'm
      disappointed relative to the great expectations and anxieties I
      had going in.<br>
      <br>
      It may be that all the preliminary talk about visions just set my
      rational left hemisphere into highly skeptical overdrive. Setting
      me up like that - you will experience the presence of God - might
      have been a mistake. When I bring this up later with Persinger, he
      tells me that the machine's effects differ among people, depending
      on their "lability" - Persinger jargon meaning sensitivity or
      vulnerability.<br>
      <br>
      "Also, you were in a comfortable laboratory," he points out. "You
      knew nothing could happen to you. What if the same intense
      experience occurred at 3 in the morning in a bedroom all by
      yourself? Or you suddenly stalled on an abandoned road at night
      when you saw a peculiar light and then had that experience? What
      label would you have placed on it then?"<br>
      <br>
      Point taken. I'd probably be calling Art Bell once a week,
      alerting the world to the alien invasion.<br>
      <br>
      But then, Persinger continued, being labile is itself a
      fluctuating condition. There are interior factors that can
      exacerbate it - stress, fear, injury - and exterior sources that
      might provoke odd but brief disturbances in the usually stable
      electromagnetic fields around us. Persinger theorizes, for
      example, that just prior to earthquakes there are deformations in
      the natural EM field caused by the intense pressure change in the
      tectonic plates below. He has published a paper called "The
      Tectonic Strain Theory as an Explanation for UFO Phenomena," in
      which he maintains that around the time of an earthquake, changes
      in the EM field could spark mysterious lights in the sky. A labile
      observer, in Persinger's view, could easily mistake the luminous
      display for an alien visit.<br>
      <br>
      As we sit in his office, Persinger argues that other environmental
      disturbances - ranging from solar flares and meteor showers to oil
      drilling - probably correlate with visionary claims, including
      mass religious conversions, ghost lights, and haunted houses. He
      says that if a region routinely experiences mild earthquakes or
      other causes of change in the electromagnetic fields, this may
      explain why the spot becomes known as sacred ground. That would
      include the Hopi tribe's hallowed lands, Delphi, Mount Fuji, the
      Black Hills, Lourdes, and the peaks of the Andes, not to mention
      most of California.<br>
      <br>
      From time to time, a sensed presence can also occur among crowds,
      Persinger says, thereby giving the divine vision the true
      legitimacy of a common experience, and making it practically
      undeniable.<br>
      <br>
      "One classic example was the apparition of Mary over the Coptic
      Church in Zeitoun, Egypt, in the 1960s," he continues. "This
      phenomenon lasted off and on for several years. It was seen by
      thousands of people, and the appearance seemed to precede the
      disturbances that occurred during the building of the Aswan High
      Dam. I have multiple examples of reservoirs being built or lakes
      being filled, and reports of luminous displays and UFO flaps. But
      Zeitoun was impressive."<br>
      <br>
      Persinger says there were balls of light that moved around the
      cross atop the church. "They were influenced by the cross, of
      course. It looked like a circle with a triangle on the bottom. If
      you had an imagination, it looked like a person. Upside down, by
      the way, it was the classical UFO pattern. It's curious that this
      happened during a marked increase in hostilities between Egyptians
      and Israelis, and both interpreted the phenomenon as proof that
      they would be successful. It's just so classical of human beings.
      Take an anomalous event, and one group will interpret it one way,
      and another group another."<br>
      <br>
      Might it surprise anyone to learn, in view of Persinger's
      theories, that when Joseph Smith was visited by the angel Moroni
      before founding Mormonism, and when Charles Taze Russell started
      the Jehovah's Witnesses, powerful Leonid meteor showers were
      occurring?<br>
      <br>
      Taken together, Persinger's ideas and published studies go awfully
      far - he's claiming to identify the primum mobile underlying all
      the supernatural stories we've developed over the last few
      thousand years. You might think Christians would be upset that
      this professor in Sudbury is trying to do with physics what
      Nietzsche did with metaphysics - kill off God. Or you might think
      that devout ufologists would denounce him for putting neuroscience
      on the side of the skeptics.<br>
      <br>
      "Actually, it's more a mind-set that gets disturbed than a
      particular belief," offers Persinger. "Some Christians say, 'Well,
      God invented the brain, so of course this is how it would happen.'
      UFO types say, 'This is good. Now we can tell the fake UFO
      sightings from the real ones.'"<br>
      <br>
      Oh, I have no doubt. I mean, who among all the churchgoers and
      alien fiends will let some distant egghead with a souped-up
      motorcycle helmet spoil their fun? It goes without saying that the
      human capacity to rationalize around Persinger's theory is far
      greater than all the replicated studies science could produce. The
      real tradition Persinger falls into is that of trying to explain
      away mystical experience. Jaynes thought visitations from God were
      mere aural detritus from the Stone Age. And just recently, another
      study suggested that sleep paralysis might account for visions of
      God and alien abduction.<br>
      <br>
      Who knows? Perhaps mystical visions are in fact nothing more than
      a bit of squelchy feedback in the temporal lobes. But that's such
      a preposterously small part of what most people think of when they
      think of God, it seems insanely grandiose to suggest that anyone
      has explained away "God." It's almost ironic. Every so often
      during one of America's little creation-science tempests, some
      humorless rationalist like Stephen Jay Gould steps forward to say
      that theology is an inadequate foundation for the study of
      science. Noted. And vice versa.<br>
      <br>
      But Persinger's ideas are harder to shake off than that. When I
      return to America, I am greeted by the news that massive
      intersections of power lines do not, in fact, cause cancer. For
      years scientists had advanced the power line-cancer connection,
      based on the results of Robert Liburdy's benchmark 1992 study. But
      a tip to the federal Office of Research Integrity initiated an
      investigation of Liburdy's work; it found that his data had been
      falsified.<br>
      <br>
      Persinger's experiments and resulting theories suggest some new
      ideas about our waning 20th century, which began with Thomas
      Edison convincing the world to cocoon itself inside electrically
      wired shelters, throbbing with pulses of electromagnetic fields.
      Granted, those fields are quite weak, arguably too tiny to affect
      our physical bodies in ways Liburdy had suggested. But what about
      Persinger's notion that such fields may be tinkering with our
      consciousness?<br>
      <br>
      Is it a coincidence that this century - known as the age of
      anxiety, a time rife with various hysterias, the era that gave
      birth to existentialism - is also when we stepped inside an
      electromagnetic bubble and decided to live there? We have never
      quite comprehended that we walk about in a sea of mild
      electromagnetism just as we do air. It is part of our atmosphere,
      part of the containing bath our consciousness swims in. Now we are
      altering it, heightening it, condensing it. The bubble is being
      increasingly shored up with newer, more complicated fields:
      computers, pagers, cell phones. Every day, entrepreneurs invent
      more novel ways to seduce us into staying inside this web. The
      Internet is well named.<br>
      <br>
      Naturally, many people would presume that such a change must be a
      malignant force when directed at the delicate gossamer of
      consciousness. Yet evolution is a tricky business. Accidental
      changes often turn out to be lifesaving preparations for some
      other condition that could never have been predicted.<br>
      <br>
      A few might see a world of possibility in Persinger's theories.
      His booth has helped us discover and confirm our true predicament.
      "Seeing God" is really just a soothing euphemism for the fleeting
      awareness of ourselves alone in the universe: a look in that
      existential mirror. The "sensed presence" - now easily generated
      by a machine pumping our brains with electromagnetic spirituality
      - is nothing but our exquisite and singular self, at one with the
      true solitude of our condition, deeply anxious. We're itching to
      get out of here, to escape this tired old environment with its
      frayed carpets, blasted furniture, and shabby old God. Time to
      move on and discover true divinity all over again. <br>

      Rudi Affolter and Gwen Tighe have both experienced strong
      religious visions. He is an atheist; she a Christian. He thought
      he had died; she thought she had given birth to Jesus. Both have
      temporal lobe epilepsy.<br>
      <br>
      Like other forms of epilepsy, the condition causes fitting but it
      is also associated with religious hallucinations. Research into
      why people like Rudi and Gwen saw what they did has opened up a
      whole field of brain science: neurotheology.<br>
      <br>
      The connection between the temporal lobes of the brain and
      religious feeling has led one Canadian scientist to try
      stimulating them. (They are near your ears.) 80% of Dr Michael
      Persinger's experimental subjects report that an artificial
      magnetic field focused on those brain areas gives them a feeling
      of 'not being alone'. Some of them describe it as a religious
      sensation.<br>
      <br>
      His work raises the prospect that we are programmed to believe in
      god, that faith is a mental ability humans have developed or been
      given. And temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) could help unlock the
      mystery.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Religious leaders</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      History is full of charismatic religious figures. Could any of
      them have been epileptics? The visions seen by Bible characters
      like Moses or Saint Paul are consistent with Rudi's and Gwen's,
      but there is no way to diagnose TLE in people who lived so long
      ago.<br>
      <br>
      There are, though, more recent examples, like one of the founders
      of the Seventh Day Adventist Movement, Ellen White. Born in 1827,
      she suffered a brain injury aged 9 that totally changed her
      personality. She also began to have powerful religious visions.<br>
      <br>
      Representatives of the Movement doubt that Ellen White suffered
      from TLE, saying her injury and visions are inconsistent with the
      condition, but neurologist Gregory Holmes believes this explains
      her condition.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Better than sex</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The first clinical evidence to link the temporal lobes with
      religious sensations came from monitoring how TLE patients
      responded to sets of words. In an experiment where people were
      shown either neutral words (table), erotic words (sex) or
      religious words (god), the control group was most excited by the
      sexually loaded words. This was picked up as a sweat response on
      the skin. People with temporal lobe epilepsy did not share this
      apparent sense of priorities. For them, religious words generated
      the greatest reaction. Sexual words were less exciting than
      neutral ones.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Make believe</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      If the abnormal brain activity of TLE patients alters their
      response to religious concepts, could altering brain patterns
      artificially do the same for people with no such medical
      condition? This is the question that Michael Persinger set out to
      explore, using a wired-up helmet designed to concentrate magnetic
      fields on the temporal lobes of the wearer.<br>
      <br>
      His subjects were not told the precise purpose of the test; just
      that the experiment looked into relaxation. 80% of participants
      reported feeling something when the magnetic fields were applied.
      Persinger calls one of the common sensations a 'sensed presence',
      as if someone else is in the room with you, when there is none.<br>
      <br>
      Horizon introduced Dr Persinger to one of Britain's most renowned
      atheists, Prof Richard Dawkins. He agreed to try his techniques on
      Dawkins to see if he could give him a moment of religious feeling.
      During a session that lasted 40 minutes, Dawkins found that the
      magnetic fields around his temporal lobes affected his breathing
      and his limbs. He did not find god.<br>
      <br>
      Persinger was not disheartened by Dawkins' immunity to the
      helmet's magnetic powers. He believes that the sensitivity of our
      temporal lobes to magnetism varies from person to person. People
      with TLE may be especially sensitive to magnetic fields; Prof
      Dawkins is well below average, it seems. It's a concept that
      clerics like Bishop Stephen Sykes give some credence as well:
      could there be such a thing as a talent for religion?<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Brain imaging</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Sykes does, though, see a great difference between a 'sensed
      presence' and a genuine religious experience. Scientists like
      Andrew Newberg want to see just what does happen during moments of
      faith. He worked with Buddhist, Michael Baime, to study the brain
      during meditation. By injecting radioactive tracers into Michael's
      bloodstream as he reached the height of a meditative trance,
      Newberg could use a brain scanner to image the brain at a
      religious climax.<br>
      <br>
      The bloodflow patterns showed that the temporal lobes were
      certainly involved but also that the brain's parietal lobes
      appeared almost completely to shut down. The parietal lobes give
      us our sense of time and place. Without them, we may lose our
      sense of self. Adherants to many of the world's faiths regard a
      sense of personal insignificance and oneness with a deity as
      something to strive for. Newberg's work suggests a neurological
      basis for what religion tries to generate.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Religious evolution</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      If brain function offers insight into how we experience religion,
      does it say anything about why we do? There is evidence that
      people with religious faith have longer, healthier lives. This
      hints at a survival benefit for religious people. Could we have
      evolved religious belief?<br>
      <br>
      Prof Dawkins (who subscribes to evolution to explain human
      development) thinks there could be an evolutionary advantage, not
      to believing in god, but to having a brain with the capacity to
      believe in god. That such faith exists is a by-product of enhanced
      intelligence. Prof Ramachandran denies that finding out how the
      brain reacts to religion negates the value of belief. He feels
      that brain circuitry like that Persinger and Newberg have
      identified, could amount to an antenna to make us receptive to
      god. Bishop Sykes meanwhile, thinks religion has nothing to fear
      from this neuroscience. Science is about seeking to explain the
      world around us. For him at least, it can co-exist with faith.<br>

      "How does Dr. Persinger artificially induce religious experiences
      in his patients?"<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Persinger has designed a helmet that produces a very weak
      rotating magnetic field of between ten nanotesla and one
      microtesla over the temporal lobes of the brain. This is placed on
      the subject's head and they are placed in a quiet chamber while
      blindfolded. So that there is no risk of 'suggestion', the only
      information that the subjects are given is that they are going in
      for a relaxation experiment. Neither the subject nor the
      experimenter carrying out the test has any idea of the true
      purpose of the experiment. In addition to this, the experiment is
      also run with the field switched both off and on. This procedure
      Dr. Persinger claims will induce an experience in over 80% of test
      subjects." <br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      The term God Helmet refers to an experimental apparatus in
      neurotheology. The apparatus, placed on the head of an
      experimental subject, stimulates the brain with fluctuating
      magnetic fields. Some subjects reported experiences using the same
      words used to describe spiritual experiences.[1] The leading
      researcher in this area is Michael Persinger. Persinger uses a
      modified snowmobile helmet (the "Koren Helmet") that contains
      solenoids placed over the temporal lobes, or a device nicknamed
      the Octopus that uses solenoids, both of which output "weak but
      complex" magnetic fields. The Octopus uses solenoids around the
      whole brain, in a circle just above subject's ears, eyes and the
      bony ridge at the back of the skull, a region that includes the
      temporal lobes. Persinger reports that at least 80 percent of his
      participants (working with the Koren Helmet) experience a presence
      beside them in the room, which ranges from a simple 'sensed
      presence' to God. About one percent experienced God, while many
      more had less evocative, but still significant experiences of
      'another being'.<br>
      <br>
      The apparatus uses magnetic fields, and not EMF emissions, as is
      sometimes thought. Much of the controversy surrounding the 'God
      Helmet' is due to this misunderstanding. Further confusion has
      appeared from the misperception that Persinger's apparatus is an
      example of TMS (transcranial magnetic stimulation), a clinical
      technique that employs magnetic fields much stronger than the
      Koren Helmet, and that uses pulsed 'trained' magnetic fields,
      instead of the 'complex magnetic fields' used in Persinger's
      research.<br>
      <br>
      There is controversy as to the source of the effects Persinger
      measured. In December 2004 Nature reported that a group of Swedish
      researchers, attempting to replicate the experiment under
      double-blind conditions, were not able to verify the effect.[2]
      Susan Blackmore, experimental psychologist and experienced
      researcher of 'paranormal' experiences, was reluctant to give up
      on the theory just yet. She said "When I went to Persinger's lab
      and underwent his procedures I had the most extraordinary
      experiences I've ever had… I'll be surprised if it turns out to be
      a placebo effect." [3] Persinger, however, takes issue with the
      Swedish attempts to replicate his work. "They didn't replicate it,
      not even close," he says.[cite this quote] He argues that the
      Swedish group did not expose the subjects to magnetic fields for
      long enough to produce an effect. He also stresses that many of
      his studies were indeed double blinded.[4]<br>
      <br>
      Although the equipment and instructions were supplied by Persinger
      to the Swedish team, later changes in the software, made necessary
      by faster computers, which the Swedish team didn't have, may have
      confounded the Swedes' results. Both Persinger and the Swedish
      team have published polemical commentaries.<br>
      <br>
      A report of an experiment on Richard Dawkins in 2003 said:<br>
      <br>
      The experiment is based on the recent finding that some patients
      with temporal lobe epilepsy, a neurological disorder caused by
      chaotic electrical discharges in the temporal lobes of the brain,
      seem to experience devout hallucinations that bear a striking
      resemblance to the mystical experiences of holy figures such as St
      Paul and Moses. Such associations have been noted by researchers
      for over a century, including Dr. Wilder Penfield's work,
      published in the 1950s.[5]<br>
      <br>
      Dawkins was reported not to have experienced a religious feeling.
      The report said:<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Persinger explained his lack of effects. Before donning the
      helmet, Prof Dawkins had scored low on a psychological scale
      measuring temporal lobe sensitivity.[5]<br>
      <br>
      There are others involved in the same lines of research seen in
      Dr. Persinger's work. Research by Mario Beauregard at University
      of Montreal has shown religious and spiritual experiences to
      include several brain regions, including the neurological regions
      Persinger studies.[6] However, Dr. Beauregard's work, unlike that
      of Dr. Persinger, does not include inducing religious experiences,
      and is confined to neural imaging Carmelite nuns while in prayer.
      The correlation drawn between temporal lobe epilepsy and religious
      experience, as discussed by Persinger, has been questioned. The
      auditory and visual hallucinations as well as emotional states
      experienced by Temporal Lobe epilepsy (TLE) patients during the
      seizure state typically induce sensations of malcontent, rather
      than ecstatic or pleasant sensations that are integral to
      spiritual experience, as noted by neurologist John R Hughes.
      However, even though only a small percent of TLE seizures include
      religious experiences, the study of these individuals nevertheless
      provides important evidence concerning the neural basis for
      religious and mystic experiences.[7][8]<br>

      Michael A. Persinger (born June 26, 1945), is a cognitive
      neuroscience researcher and university professor. He has worked at
      Laurentian University, Canada since 1971.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Early life</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Michael Persinger was born in Jacksonville, Florida and grew up
      primarily in Virginia, Maryland and Wisconsin. He attended Carroll
      College from 1963 to 1964, and graduated from the University of
      Wisconsin–Madison in 1967. He then obtained an M.A. in
      physiological psychology from the University of Tennessee and a
      Ph.D. from the University of Manitoba in 1971.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Research and academic work</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Much of his work focuses on the commonalities that exist between
      the sciences, and aims to integrate fundamental concepts of
      various branches of science[citation needed]. He organized the
      Behavioral Neuroscience Program at Laurentian University in
      Sudbury, Ontario, which became one of the first to integrate
      chemistry, biology and psychology[citation needed].<br>
      <br>
      During the 1980s he stimulated people's temporal lobes
      artificially with a weak magnetic field to see if he could induce
      a religious state (see God helmet). He claimed that the field
      could produce the sensation of "an ethereal presence in the room".<br>
      <br>
      Susan Blackmore, a former academic psychologist and parapsychology
      researcher: "When I went to Persinger's lab and underwent his
      procedures I had the most extraordinary experiences I've ever
      had." "I'll be surprised if it turns out to be a placebo effect."
      [1]<br>
      <br>
      Michael Persinger has also contributed to research into the
      Miracle of the sun at Fatima and other Marian apparitions. He
      theorized that the stimulation of the cerebral-temporal lobe may
      have been the actual cause of the Marian apparition phenomenon. He
      believes the religious content of the experiences many have been a
      result of their obsession with religious themes and their lack of
      education. He has contributed to 2 papers about The Miracle of the
      Sun. [2]<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Tectonic Strain Theory</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Persinger has also come to public attention due to his 1975
      Tectonic Strain Theory (TST) of how geophysical variables may
      correlate with sightings of unidentified flying objects (UFOs).
      Persinger argued that strain within the Earth's crust near seismic
      faults produces intense electromagnetic (EM) fields, creating
      bodies of light that some interpret as glowing UFOs.
      Alternatively, he argued that the EM fields generate
      hallucinations in the temporal lobe, based on images from popular
      culture, of alien craft, beings, communications, or creatures.<br>
      <br>
      Canadian researcher Chris Rutkowski of the University of Manitoba
      has become a prominent harsh critic of Persinger's Tectonic Strain
      Theory. For one thing, Rutowski argues, in order to try to
      accommodate UFO sightings in regions far removed from faults,
      Persinger has claimed that UFO-like lights or hallucinations can
      manifest hundreds of miles away from an area of seismic activity.
      Not only does this place an absurdly great distance between the
      actual area of tectonic stress and the surmised significant EM
      field, it also makes the theory unscientific by destroying any
      possible predictive power. Nearly every place on the planet lies
      within a few hundred miles of a seismically active area. Rutkowski
      pointed out severe flaws in Persinger's statistical methodology,
      since he confused possible correlation (however weak) with
      causality. For example, one could more easily explain occasional
      clusters of UFO sightings along earthquake fault-lines by the fact
      that populations often occur there in higher densities and by the
      fact that transportation routes often follow major fault lines,
      such as the San Andreas fault in California.<br>
      <br>
      As with criticisms of Persinger's claims that minute laboratory
      magnetic fields can invoke hallucinations, Rutowski also points
      out that Persinger's inferred seismic EM fields would have much
      less influence than what people commonly experience near
      electrical appliances like television sets or hair driers. This
      again raises the question as to why people don't experience UFOs
      or aliens far more often than they do, or why these hypothetical
      hallucinations from electrical devices wouldn't drown out any
      possible contribution from much weaker geophysical fields. Once
      again, Persinger notes that the magnitude of the EM fields may
      have less significance than the particular temporal patterns.
      Furthermore, commentators such as British researcher Albert
      Budden, has proposed that man-made electromagnetic emissions can
      (in certain circumstances) generate close encounter experiences
      and has cited possible examples of this effect in his work
      Electric UFOs (Blandford, 1998).<br>
      <br>
      In the UK, Paul Devereux advocates a variant geophysical theory
      similar to TST, the Earthlights theory. However, unlike Persinger,
      Devereaux generally restricts such effects to the immediate
      vicinity of a fault line. Devereux's approach also differs from
      Persinger's in holding triboluminescence rather than
      piezoelectricity as the "more likely candidate" for the production
      of naturally occurring UFOs. Devereux doesn't advocate, as in
      Persinger's TST, that the phenomenon might create hallucinations
      of UFO encounters in people, instead proposing an even more
      radical hypothesis: that earthlights may possess intelligence and
      even have the ability to read witness' thoughts. [3]<br>
      <br>
      UFO researchers critical of the sesmic stress theory admit that,
      while, observations of diffuse lights during (and sometimes before
      and after) very severe earthquakes may give some weak support to
      some parts of TST and Earthlights theory (see Earthquake lights),
      they question the ability of fault lines to generate luminous
      effects and hallucinatory experiences under much less severe
      conditions(as cited above). Nonetheless, even TST critics such as
      Rutowski think such theories may hold some promise for explaining
      a small percentage of UFO phenomena, although they doubt that they
      can ever offer a comprehensive explanation for the vast majority
      of unexplained UFO cases. Other UFO researchers (mainly in the
      U.K) believe this very limited interpretation of the TST is
      brought into question by the clustering of UFO reports within
      areas prone to faulting - such as the Pennine region of northern
      Britain. While acknowledging the drawback's of Persinger's theory,
      they feel that amended versions of it may account for a
      significant proportion of "True UFO" reports.[4]<br>

      <br>
      ....Dr. Persinger, professor of neurosciences as Laurentic
      University, Canada, claims that people can experience a sense of
      timelessness, paranormal visions and even come ‘face to face’ with
      God by wearing his unique ‘God Machine’ (Ford 2002). The ‘God
      Machine’, a specially designed helmet, gently stimulates and
      causes a temporary influx of neuronal firing in the limbic system,
      much like as occurs during natural temporal lobe epilepsy. During
      Persinger’s experiment, subject’s sensory input is restricted,
      eyes are covered and ears are blocked, as means of detracting from
      the influence of environmental stimuli. When the helmet is in
      pace, electrodes pulsate currents to the brain, causing a
      ‘magnetic field pattern’ in the right hemisphere (Martin 2002).
      This can enable ‘micro-seizures’ to be generated. Manipulation of
      the limbic system has caused subjects to report feelings of
      ‘forced motion’, physical distortion and hyper emotionality (Ford
      2002). Stimulation direst to the temporal lobe has been noted to
      inspire a sense of spiritual well-being, paranormal experience and
      feelings of hyper-religiousity. 80% of subjects recorded
      experiencing a feeling that they were ‘not alone’ and sensed a
      ‘spiritual presence’ when their temporal lobe was stimulate (BBC
      2003).<br>
      <br>
      Persinger’s work leads to the question of why such reactions occur
      when these specific areas of the brain are stimulate? Persinger
      argues that over stimulation and unsyncopated reaction in one area
      of the temporal cortex can cause a misinterpretation of ‘the
      self’. During moments of neuronal imbalance in the left hemisphere
      of the temporal cortex (an area concerned with the sense of self),
      the brain interprets the presence of the right hemisphere as a
      personified ’other entity’, or God (Ford 2002).<br>
      <br>
      In conjunction with the physical reaction in the temporal cortex,
      the closely interlinked limbic system, specifically the amygdala
      (seat of higher emotion) and hippocampus (seat of stored
      memory/experience) becomes hyper-stimulated. This can generate
      feelings of arousal and induce hallucinogenic visions. Vast
      concentrations of opiate receptors located in the amygdala coupled
      with the release of large quantities of enkephalins during hyper
      stimulation can give rise to feelings of euphoria and rapture
      (Joseph 1996).<br>
      <br>
      Are certain people predisposed to their experiences through
      temporal lobe epilepsy by what Bishop Sykes(2003) called a ’talent
      for religion’? During an interview given to BBC’s ’Horizons’
      programme (2003), temporal lobe epilepsy sufferer Gwen Tighe, a
      devout Christian, ,made claim that during a seizure she had become
      convinced that she had given birth Christ. Tighe claims to have
      experienced intense visual hallucinations and physical reactions
      as though in late stages of labour. On recovery from seizure Tighe
      commented of feelings of prolonged sense of euphoria and intense
      spiritual enlightenment.<br>
      <br>
      It is possible that predisposition plays a vital role in the
      individual’s experience during temporal lobe seizure. Rudi
      Affolter, believer in the esoteric and agnostic, claimed to
      encounter alien beings and suffer near death experience when
      suffering epileptic fits. At no time did Affolter make mention of
      divine experience. Adffolter’s belief in the paranormal appeared
      to produce ‘paranormal’ experience during seizure (BBC 2003).
      Considering this case in contrast of that of Tighe, it is possible
      to conclude that sufferer’s seizure experiences follow
      expectations based upon their personal beliefs. A Christian, for
      example, is more likely to ‘encounter’ God at such an event than
      an agnostic.<br>
      <br>
      Undertaking Persinger’s experiment, Professor R.Dawkins, scientist
      and renowned atheist, claimed only to experience mild limb pain
      and slight respiratory difficulties. Dawkins certainly did not
      ‘meet God’, nor encounter any unusual or enlightening experience.
      Persinger was not disheartened by Dawkins’ response. Theorising
      that different individuals have varying levels of sensitivity to
      the magnetic field the helmet generates. Persinger suggested that
      Dawkins’ naturally holds a high level of resilience to the
      magnetism, while an epilepsy sufferer holds high sensitivity. This
      could account for the anomalous result (BBC 2003).<br>
      <br>
      Sensitivity to Persinger’s generated magnetic field may be a
      result of persistent maladjustment within the temporal cortex.
      Evidence suggests temporal lobe epileptics maintain slightly
      elevated levels of activity in the left cortex during periods of
      functional continuity (Ford 2002). This may account for the depth
      and explicitly of experience generated both naturally and
      artificially.<br>
      <br>
      Bental2] (date unknown) considered the reason why some temporal
      lobe epileptics and experienced meditators claim to hear the
      ‘voice of God’. Bental suggests this phenomena is due to a simple
      misattribute of the ‘inner voice’, during periods of sensory
      isolation. The brocca area of the brain, responsible for speech
      and language recognition, remains active during meditation and
      seizure. Restriction of sensory information causes the brocca to
      misjudge the internal voice as one generated by external stimuli.
      This misinterpretation can lead the individual to confuse their
      internal monologue with the voice of an external entity.
      Occurrence during meditation or ‘religiously experiential’ seizure
      could lead the individual to believe they are hearing the voice of
      God, especially in situations of solitude. Ramachandran also noted
      that temporal lobe epileptics tend to have “a heightened response
      to religious language, specifically religious terms and icons.”<br>
      <br>
      Not all limbic hyper-activation is the result of temporal lobe
      epilepsy. Scientist have discovered that hyper-activation can be
      induced by means of taking certain narcotics. Lilly (1972)
      experienced “the presence of spiritual, godlike beings” after
      combining sensory and social isolation with the taking of LSD.
      Hallucinogenic narcotics alter the natural biochemical processes
      and affect certain neurotransmitter sites. Increased levels of
      dopamine are released into the body and serotonin blocked in the
      amygdala generates feelings of euphoria (Chapman 3 date unknown 1)
      . This holds relevance to religious histories. It is well
      documented that Shamanistic tradition and American India ritual
      incorporated drugs such as mescaline, peyote and psilocybe by
      means of achieving heightened spiritual sensation (Schultes,
      Hofmann &amp; Ratsch).<br>
      <br>
      Intense sensory stimulation, such as dancing or chanting, also
      arouse the limbic system and assist in heightening ‘religious
      experience’. The deactivation of certain neuronal activity from
      reaching other areas of the brain by the hippocampus and extensive
      limbic stimulation can produce hallucinations. Newberg et al
      (2001, p42) describe such occurrence as “Hyperarousal with
      Quiescent Breakthrough” . Intense active stimulation can induce an
      “ecstatic rush of orgasmic-like energy”, assisting in the tagging
      of special significance to such action.<br>
      <br>
      The concept of perception must also be regarded. Neuronal activity
      cannot always discriminate between real events and those one
      perceives to be real. Newberg suggest that although spiritual
      experience can be traced though neuronal activity, it does not
      necessarily mean that these experiences are due to “neurological
      illusion” alone (Ford 2002). There is little difference between
      how the brain processes the experiential, either real or supposed.
      The difference lies within how the individual perceives
      experience. It could be said that the only distinction between
      experiencing God and seeing a tree is that a tree is a tangible
      physical object we can all agree exists.<br>
      <br>
      Does God exist? Newberg et al (2001 p37) believe yes, but only as
      a concept or ‘reality’ in the mind of the believer. Persinger
      expressed similar view, a position generated by the results of
      extensive work. Todd (1999) states, “there is no God separate from
      the believer.“ Dawkins considers the human brain to hold an
      “evolutionary advantage” with its capacity to believe in God. It
      is a product of advanced intelligence that concepts such as faith
      exist (BBC 2003).<br>
      <br>
      Neurotheology is not without its opponents. Evangelical Christian
      groups demonstrated outside Persinger’s office, considering both
      the helmet and Persinger to be “demonic” (Peet 1998).
      Intellectually, theologian Haught has argued that
      “[neuroscientists] have isolated one small aspect of religious
      experience and are identifying that with the whole of religion”
      (Martin 2002). Religion is far more than ‘experiencing God’,
      Haught states; religion is about commitment, suffering, myth,
      unity and community. The problem with neurotheology is that it
      does not encompass the totality of what ‘religious experience’
      really consists of. It is a unifying principlewhich brings people
      together, sharing the same beliefs and encountering similar
      experiences. These are aspects which science cannot replicate in a
      lab.<br>
      <br>
      Believers counter-argue neuroscientific position on the existence
      of God. Naturally a deity who advocated discourse would design the
      human brain to allow interaction Ramachandran considers that brain
      circuitry, as Persinger has identified, could be tantamount to an
      antenna which assists the believer to communicate with God (BBC
      2003).<br>
      <br>
      It is the job of science to make sense of the world around us, for
      some that includes religion. Since there is no real way one can
      truly determine the existence of God, both believers and
      nerotheologians must rely on faith to ‘stand fast’ on their
      position. Neurotheologians such as Persinger and Newberg do not
      condemn religious belief; they simply offer an explanation as to
      why some encounter religious experience. In fact, Newberg (2001)
      considers the beneficial effects of participation in religious
      activity, observing that participation in prayer enhances the
      immune system, lowers heart rate and restricts the release of
      stress hormones into the bloodstream (p131). Significantly, belief
      in God can offer reassurance and unconditional love in times of
      crisis. Science cannot. Maybe it is time to follow our hearts (and
      our heads) and come to our own conclusions.<br>
      <br>
      Perhaps Nietzsche was correct in stating, “God is dead”. With the
      field of neurotheology expanding rapidly, it is possible that
      science will kill off the deity once and for all.<br>

      A brilliant neuroscientist in Canada has invented a helmet that
      delivers the divine bliss of religious epiphany using not God, but
      magnets that stimulate the frontal lobe of your brain. No kidding,
      test subjects have reported everything from LSD-like color plays
      all the way up to incredibly real visitations from deceased
      relatives. The most common occurrence, though, is the “sensed
      presence,” like someone or something is standing near you.
      Something unexplainable but, you know, there; something like a guy
      in a robe with a beard who’s powerful but nice.<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Michael Persinger is the father of the God Helmet. “Our major
      thrust has been to understand creativity,” Persinger says from his
      office in the neuroscience department of Laurentian University in
      Sudbury, Ontario. “Many of the great thinkers—be they religious or
      scientific—often had these inspirations and didn’t know how or why
      they’d obtained them.” By sending magnetic patterns that mimic
      certain brain states through his helmet and into your head,
      Persinger hopes to uncover the processes that historically have
      been attributed to divine intervention or ghostly inspiration.<br>
      <br>
      “Religious people try the helmet and get all the same results as
      an atheist: sensed presence, detachment from their body, cosmic
      significance, and both groups always chalk it up to God, or a dead
      person,” explains Dr. Persinger, “The point is that these things
      that you think are God are really coming from inside.”<br>
      <br>
      Holy shit, I’m God. How about that? Still, some people can’t get
      it through their heads. “We’ve had many people come in, knowing
      they’re in a laboratory wearing a helmet that is magnetically
      stimulating their brain, but they still believe they’re being
      visited by the supernatural.”<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Persinger is not mad at God or anything, but he does have one
      very practical and compelling reason to prove that the old man is
      just not there. “The God experience in the history of the human
      being is a trivial phenomenon. Right now, when people have an
      experience and they attribute it to God, depending upon their
      culture, they may often use it as an excuse to kill others.” So
      what happens if zealots can be shown that God is really an
      electrical impulse in their brain? “That will mean two things,”
      Persinger explains. “One, don’t take everything you think of as
      God as valid. And two, we can begin to explore ourselves. The most
      fundamental and profound spirituality for anybody would be finding
      out how their own brain is organized.”<br>
      <br>
      When someone really understands themselves, they won’t want to put
      their lives at risk over some bullshit about whose despot has a
      bigger dick. This means that if we can get a God helmet in every
      home and office around the world, we will all be strutting around,
      fully self-actualized, hugging each other like Richard Harris and
      Peter O’Toole, totally forgetting about holy war and religious
      snobbery. We’ll be the best planet ever because we’ll all be God.
      Let’s do it!<br>

      An apparatus for generating electromagnetic waveforms to stimulate
      a subject includes a computing device generating digital waveform
      data. A digital-to-analog converter receives the digital waveform
      data from the computing device and generates a corresponding
      analog waveform signal. A channel selector having output channels
      is operable to apply the analog waveform signal to the output
      channels when the output channels are actuated. A sequencer
      independent of the computing device selects and actuates the
      output channels of the channel selector. An electromagnetic field
      generator is coupled to each output channel of the channel
      selector. The electromagnetic field generator coupled to each
      actuated output channel converts the analog waveform signal into
      an electromagnetic waveform thereby to expose a subject wearing
      the electromagnetic field generators to the electromagnetic
      waveform.<br>

      An apparatus for generating electromagnetic waveforms to stimulate
      a subject includes an electromagnetic waveform signal generator to
      generate analog signals representing desired electromagnetic
      waveforms. A selector responsive to channel select input applies
      the analog signals to selected output channels of the selector.
      Electromagnetic devices are coupled to the output channels of the
      selector to convert analog signals into electromagnetic waveforms.
      The electromagnetic devices coupled to the selected output
      channels are driven by the analog signals to expose a subject
