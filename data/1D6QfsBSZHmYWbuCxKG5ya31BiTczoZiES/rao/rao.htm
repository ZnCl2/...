        automatic control of irrigation from field supply ditches or
        rain fed reservoirs, this patented device does not deprive when

      <br>
      Irrigation siphons are widely used in the USA and other
      agriculturally and technologically advanced countries to precisely
      control the flow of irrigation water from field ditches to the
      surface of the fields having standing crops.<br>
      <br>
      Accurate control of water is essential not only for proper plant
      growth but also to avoid excess irrigation which might raise the
      ground water table and ultimately lead to waterlogging, rise in
      salinity, and degradation of the land. Efficient irrigation
      requires proper apparatus and technique of field layout.
      Irrigation as practised in India and other developing countries is
      both uncontrolled and highly wasteful. Devices like siphons and
      siphon tubes help efficent and preceise control of irrigation
      water.<br>
      <br>
      In using water for irrigation, both timing and quantity applied
      are important. These have to be adjusted to the stage of growth of
      the plant and water requirement, which depend on several factors.
      The cultivator's understanding of the soil/plant water requirement
      plays a great part in efficient irrigation managementr. But no
      farmer can hope to achieve efficient irrigiation without proper
      apparatus. By using siphon tubes irrigation efficencies matching
      those of sprinkler systems can be btained at far less cost, both
      in terms of investment and working costs.<br>

        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The main difficulty in case of an ordinary siphon tube is that it
      ceases to function the moment air enters it and causes it to loose
      prime. The improved siphon apparatus developed by the author
      automatically prevents the loss of prime abd greatkly reduces the
      field labor required for irrigation. The invention has the
      protection of US Patent 3822715 [ and an Indian patent ].<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract --</span> An irrigation
      siphon having a pair of float-operated valves on opposite ends of
      an elongated conduit. The conduit is disposed on a levee to
      receive water through one of the valves for delivery out the other
      valve. Each valve has a float arranged such that when the water at
      the inlet end of the conduit falls below a predetermined level,
      the outlet valve is closed such that the siphon is continually
      primed even though it is not passing water.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</span><br>
      <br>
      This invention is related to siphon apparatus for delivering water
      from an irrigation channel, and more particularly to a portable
      siphon that remains primed even though the flow of water through
      the inlet is temporarily interrupted.<br>
      <br>
      Siphon tubes are used to distribute irrigation water from a supply
      channel onto the surface of the field. This method of applying
      irrigation water permits the construction of relatively simple
      water conveying channels formed by two earthen levees spaced a
      convenient distance apart. A water stream flowing between the
      levees fills the channel by the installation of a temporary dam. A
      siphon tube consisting of a short length of bent plastic pipe is
      filled with water and placed such that opposite ends of the siphon
      are on opposite sides of a levee with one end being submerged in
      the water to pass the water through the siphon tube to its
      opposite end.<br>
      <br>
      One problem with conventional, simple siphon tubes is a tendency
      to become deprimed due to either an accidental lifting of the
      siphon tube, or an interruption of the water supply due to a power
      failure of the pumps employed to transfer the water into the
      supply channel. Sometimes soil or other material floating in the
      supply channel chokes the siphon inlet. In some large irrigation
      systems, a sudden power failure can simultaneously incapacitate
      several hundred siphons. The irrigation personnel then have to
      quickly reprime all the siphons when the water supply is resumed.
      Should the channel feed water be started without also
      simultaneously starting most of the siphons, an entire section of
      the supply channel can be washed away causing damage to the
      standing crop.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</span><br>
      <br>
      The broad purpose of the present invention is to provide an
      improved portable irrigation siphon apparatus that remains primed
      at such times as the water flow in the supply channel should
      become interrupted. In the preferred embodiment of the invention,
      the entire siphon apparatus can be removed from one channel and
      carried to another channel without becoming deprimed. Thus, when
      the water level at the inlet end of the siphon is restored to its
      normal level, the siphon automatically resumes passing water from
      the supply channel.<br>
      <br>
      These and other objects and advantages of the invention will
      become readily apparent to those skilled in the art to which the
      invention pertains upon reference to the following detailed
      description.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED
        EMBODIMENTS</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Referring to the drawings, a typical irrigation field includes an
      elongated levee 10 forming the bank of a supply ditch 12 which
      receives water that is to be passed to a lower field 14 on the
      opposite side of levee 10. A preferred siphon apparatus comprises
      an elongated flexible conduit 16. An L-shapted, rigid pipe 17A is
      mounted on one end of conduit 16, and a similar L-shaped pipe 17B
      is carried at the opposite end of the conduit, below the level of
      water 18 in ditch 12.<br>
      <br>
      A pair of similarly shaped siphon valves 20 and 22 are mounted on
      the pipes 17A and 17B, respectively. The two valves are similar to
      one another so that a description of one will apply to the other
      except that valve 20 functions as an inlet valve and valve 22
      functions as an outlet valve in accordance with the passage of
      water through conduit 16.<br>
      <br>
      Referring to FIG. 2, outlet valve 22 has a hollow elbow-shaped
      body 24 supporting a collar 26. Pipe 17B is received through
      collar 26 and supported at its extreme end on a pivot 28 in such a
      manner that body 24 can be pivoted about the end of pipe 17B. A
      cylindrical bushing 30 is mounted on both collar 26 and pipe 17B
      to provide a seal.<br>
      <br>
      A resilient ring 32 is mounted on bushing 30. When ring 32 is
      removed from the bushing, body 24 can be pivoted to a selected
      position with respect to pipe 17B. When ring 32 is mounted on the
      bushing, body 24 is clamped in its position on pipe 17B.<br>
      <br>
      Body 24 has a short tubular section 34, and a sleeve 36 mounted on
      tubular section 34. Sleeve 36 has an opening 38 for passing water
      at right angles to the direction of water flow through an opening
      40 in pipe 17B.<br>
      <br>
      An annular shoulder 42 is formed about outlet opening 38.<br>
      <br>
      A cylindrical strainer 44 has its lower end received in sleeve 36.
      A wall 46 closes the upper end of strainer 44. Strainer 44 has a
      plurality of openings 48 for passing water.<br>
      <br>
      A cylindrical float 50 having a diameter slightly less than that
      of strainer 44 but larger than that of outlet opening 38 is
      mounted in the strainer. Float 50 has a wall 52 for engaging
      shoulder 42 to form a water-tight seal blocking the passage of
      water through opening 38. Float 50 is movable between a lower
      position in which it engages shoulder 42 to block seal opening 38,
      and an upper position in which it allows water to pass through
      opening 38.<br>
      <br>
      The preferred siphon apparatus is primed by placing it under
      water. When both valves 20 and 22 are below water level, floats 50
      in both valves will open because of their bouyancy thereby
      allowing water to fill conduit 16. When the conduit is full of
      water, it can be lifted out of the water by grasping the center of
      the conduit. When the conduit is lifted out of the water, each
      float valve 50 drops vertically to close its respective opening 38
      thereby trapping the water in the conduit to maintain a primed
      condition. The siphon can then be carried to any suitable position
      along the irrigation levee.<br>
      <br>
      When either siphon 20 or 22 is positioned below the water level of
      ditch 12, and the other siphon is disposed at substantially the
      same height, water will start to pass through the siphon. The two
      siphons are placed on opposite sides of the levee and pipes 17A
      and 17B adjusted to conform to the inclination of the levee banks
      while each valve body is disposed in an upright position.<br>
      <br>
      The rate of water flow through the siphon can be adjusted by
      raising or lowering outlet valve 22. As long as the inlet valve is
      submerged below water level, the flow of water through the
      apparatus will continue. However, when the water level falls in
      ditch 12 to cause float 50 to approach inlet opening 38, the water
      level will reach a height in which the float will become sucked
      into the valve seat thereby closing off the water flow.<br>
      <br>
      Float 50 at the outlet unit responds to this closing off action by
      blocking its respective opening 38. This positive sealing of both
      the inlet and the outlet valves also reduces the tendency of the
      water in conduit 16 to evaporate. In addition, the strainers not
      only prevent the entry of particles that might block water flow
      through the apparatus but also shields the inlet and outlet
      openings from the wind and the sun. Thus, the preferred apparatus
      will hold its prime for long periods of flow interruption and is
      ready to operate as soon as the water level in ditch 12 is
      restored to its normal height.<br>
      <br>
      Now referring to FIG. 3, another valve 100 is illustrated that may
      be used in place of valve 20.<br>
      <br>
      Siphon 100 comprises a hollow elbow 102 having openings 104 and
      106. Opening 104 is formed at right angles to opening 106 and the
      diameter of body 102 progressively increases from opening 104 to
      opening 106. An L-shaped pipe 108, which is formed of a rigid
      material, has an integral collar 110 slightly larger in diameter
      than opening 104. Collar 110 is arranged such that the extreme end
      of conduit 108 is disposed adjacent the bend in elbow 102. A
      resilient bushing 112 is mounted on conduit 108 between collar 110
      and opening 104 to form a water-tight seal.<br>
      <br>
      A boss 114 is mounted on elbow 102 adjacent the end of conduit
      108. A fastener 116 is seated on boss 114 and has an inner
      threaded end 118 engaged with a crossmember 120 mounted adjacent
      the end of conduit 108 such that by turning fastener 116, collar
      110 can be firmly engaged with bushing 112. By turning fastener
      116 in the opposite direction, collar 110 can be released from
      bushing 112 to permit elbow 102 to be rotated to a selected
      position with respect to the end of conduit 108.<br>
      <br>
      A valve sleeve 122 is mounted on the end 106 of the elbow. Sleeve
      122 has an opening 124 for passing water either into or out of
      elbow 102. An annular shoulder 126 is formed about the edge of
      opening 124. A cylindrical strainer 127 having a plurality of
      openings 128 is seated in sleeve 122. A wall 130 blocks the upper
      end of strainer 127.<br>
      <br>
      A ball-shaped float 132 having a diameter larger than that of
      shoulder 126 is disposed in cage 127. When float 132 is raised
      above shoulder 126, water can pass through opening 124 and out
      strainer openings 128 or in the reverse direction depending upon
      whether siphon 100 is receiving water into or passing water from
      the siphon. Float 132 is formed with a diameter chosen such that
      the float cooperates with the shoulder to form a water-tight seal
      to block water flow through opening 124.<br>
