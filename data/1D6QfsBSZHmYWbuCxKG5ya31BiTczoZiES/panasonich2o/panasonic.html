            Water Purification Technology’ – Creating Drinkable Water
            with Sunlight and Photocatalysts</b><br>
        </big><br>
        <i>Demonstration machine of Photocatalytic Water Purification
          Technology</i><br>
        <br>
        <img alt="" src="201.jpg" height="199" width="300"><br>

      <br>
      In India, approximately 70 per cent of the population uses water
      not from taps but primarily that from under the ground. Leaching
      into it are harmful substances such as agrochemical residues, the
      arsenic of Himalayan ore veins, and hexavalent chromium produced
      from leather tanneries. This contamination has come to be seen as
      a societal problem, having caused health problems for as many as
      50 million people.<br>
      <br>
      Many other countries throughout Africa, Asia and South America
      rely on underground water often contaminated. Even developed
      countries like the USA have ground water supplies being
      compromised by fracking activities<br>
      <br>
      To solve such drinking-water issues worldwide, Panasonic has
      developed its own photocatalytic water purification technology.
      This technology uses photocatalysts and the UV rays from sunlight
      to detoxify polluted water* at high speeds, creating safe and
      drinkable water. This breakthrough caught much attention when
      Panasonic unveiled it in Tokyo at Eco-Products 2014.<br>
      <br>
      With two core technological developments, Panasonic’s
      Photocatalytic Water Purification Technology processes water more
      efficiently<br>
      <br>
      <b>1. Achieving a High Capacity to Decompose Toxic Substances with
        Synthesis Technology of Photocatalysts</b><br>
      <br>
      When photocatalysts are exposed to ultraviolet light, formed
      reactive oxygen purifies the toxic substances. However, TiO2, a
      kind of photocatalyst, comes in extremely fine particles and is
      troublesome to collect once dispersed in water. Methods of binding
      TiO2 to larger matter have hence been used, but they in turn
      suffered a loss of surface active site. Panasonic developed a way
      of binding TiO2 to another particle, zeolite, which enables
      photocatalysts to maintain their inherent surface active site.
      Moreover, since the two particles are bound together by
      electrostatic force, there is no need for binder chemicals.<br>
      <br>
      <b>2. Achieving High Processing Speeds with Water Purification
        Technology that Disperses Photocatalytic Materials</b><br>
      <br>
      When these novel photocatalytic particles are agitated, TiO2 is
      released from the zeolite and dispersed throughout the water. As a
      result, reaction speed is markedly elevated compared to
      conventional methods of fixing TiO2 on a surface of substrates,
      enabling a large volume of water to be processed in a short amount
      of time. Leaving the water still will cause TiO2 to bind to
      zeolite again, making it easy to separate and recover the
      photocatalysts from the water – allowing them to be reused at a
      later time.<br>
      Establishing an infrastructure for supplying safe drinking water<br>
      <br>
      Along with being driven by light, another key feature of
      photocatalysts is that they remove any necessity of
      pharmaceuticals. As such, they offer a low-cost and
      environmentally friendly way of treating water.<br>
      <br>
      Panasonic aims to provide this water to small rural communities,
      for example, using trucks equipped with photocatalytic water
      purification systems. Beyond this, the company is looking at
      linking up with local water supply operators to establish water
      purification facilities, and is also considering the licensing of
      this technology to businesses. Panasonic is working to lower costs
      and maintenance requirements with the water purification systems –
      its aim being to make this technology available right across India
      and other emerging nations.<br>

      Panasonic is introducing for the first time the evolution of its
      "photocatalytic water purification technology," which uses the
      power of UV rays in sunlight to detoxify water that may contain
      harmful substances like arsenic and hexavalent chromium. The
      demonstration explains in a straightforward manner how this
      technology works. <br>

      granular, because the particle size of the resistance increases
      small, it is preferable to consider the shape of the activated
      carbon in accordance with the operating flow rate.<br>
      <br>
      Moreover, so that the activated carbon is not released into the
      water, it is preferably covered with such a mesh.<br>

      If metal, stainless steel, aluminum, copper and the like, as long
      as it is an inorganic compound, such as ceramic or glass may be
      used.<br>
      <br>
      Stainless steel is preferred from the viewpoint of the light
      source 2 is reflected to increase the photocatalytic reaction
      efficiency.<br>

      light source 2, to be used reactions as the distance between the
      photocatalyst 1 and the light source 2 is short in order to
      increase the efficiency and the light emitted from the light
      source 2 efficiently, As to surround the light source 2, it is
      preferably a structure of arranging a photocatalyst 1.<br>
      <br>
      Since the lamp is a light source 2 is the life, for easy
      replacement in advance, from the outside of the pipe may be
      disposed through a material that transmits ultraviolet rays such
      as quartz glass.<br>

      tungsten oxide, strontium titanate, niobium oxide, tantalum oxide,
      etc. may be mentioned.<br>
      <br>
      Among these, in view of the strength of activity, titanium oxide
      is preferred.<br>
      <br>
      [0025]<br>
      As the titanium oxide (IV), for example, anatase type titanium
      oxide, rutile titanium oxide, include brookite-type titanium oxide
      because the high photocatalytic activity can be obtained,
      anatase-type titanium oxide is preferable.<br>
      <br>
      The "anatase type titanium oxide" in the present invention, in the
      powder X-ray diffraction spectrum measurement (using electrodes:
      copper electrode), and refers to a titanium oxide diffraction peak
      appears in the vicinity of a diffraction angle 2θ = 25.5 °.<br>
      <br>
      [0026]<br>
      The titanium oxide addition to titanium dioxide, cited hydrous
      titanium oxide, hydrated titanium oxide, metatitanic acid,
      orthotitanic acid, titanium hydroxide, oxygen deficiency type
      titanium oxide, nitrogen substituted titanium oxide and sulfur
      substituted titanium oxide It is.<br>
      <br>
      No particular limitation is imposed on the crystal form as long as
      it has a photocatalytic activity, amorphous, anatase, rutile, may
      be any of brookite type.<br>
      <br>
      A combination of rutile and anatase titanium oxide, there is no
      problem even when combining different crystalline forms component.<br>
      <br>
      [0027]<br>
      Is often titanium oxide is a powder form, by oxidizing the metal
      surface, such as a titanium plate, it is possible to form a
      titanium oxide thin film.<br>
      <br>
      Also, by coating a titanium alkoxide may be formed titanium film
      by heat treatment.<br>
      <br>
      The titanium powder was sprayed on a metal surface, it is possible
      to form a titanium oxide film.<br>
      <br>
      [0028]<br>
      In addition, not intended to be limiting in any way be used Pt on
      the surface of the titanium oxide, Pd, Rh, Ru, Au, Ag, Cu, Fe, a
      metal such as Ni is covered.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, it not intended to be limiting in any way be used a
      photocatalyst to contain a dopant metal such as Cr or V is
      enlarged an absorption wavelength of light on the surface.<br>
      <br>
      [0029]<br>
      Titanium oxide is preferably in the range of the specific surface
      area of ​​200~350m2 / g, more preferably in the range of 250~350m2
      / g.<br>
      <br>
      Here, the specific surface area in the present invention was
      measured by the BET method (adsorption-desorption method of
      nitrogen), and a surface area value per powdered 1g of titanium
      oxide.<br>
      <br>
      If the specific surface area is more than 200m2 / g, it can
      increase the contact area between the decomposed object.<br>
      <br>
      [0030]<br>
      Light source 2, when using the titanium oxide (IV), is used one
      which generates light containing a wavelength range of the
      wavelength 350nm of 450nm which can activate.<br>
      <br>
      The more are those having a strong emission peak, it is possible
      to perform excitation of efficiently titanium oxide with respect
      to input power.<br>
      <br>
      For example, using a fluorescent lamp type black light straight
      pipe type, comprising a number of wavelengths around 380nm, since
      it is possible to irradiate efficiently wide range of the strong
      light, it can be suitably used when the area of ​​the substrate is
      large.<br>
      <br>
      Further, a halogen lamp, a xenon lamp, a light source such as a
      mercury lamp, it can be implemented by arranging such that large
      areas, such as by absorption is small mirrors and lenses of the
      ultraviolet can be irradiated.<br>
      <br>
      [0031]<br>
      Further, as a light source with a strong emission peak in the
      wavelength, there are those using semiconductor devices.<br>
      <br>
      For example, light emitting diodes, and semiconductor lasers may
      be used.<br>
      <br>
      These irradiation area is small, because the size of the light
      source portion is small is suitable for the irradiation locally
      into smaller parts.<br>
      <br>
      [0032]<br>
      The photocatalytic reaction, since oxygen is needed, in order to
      perform efficient reaction, it is insufficient in the amount
      contained in the liquid.<br>
      <br>
      Therefore, a gas containing oxygen, such as enriched oxygen gas or
      air is mixed in the reaction solution, it is desirable to increase
      the amount of dissolved oxygen.<br>
      <br>
      The diffusing means 3 for mixing a gas into the reaction liquid,
      and those of mixing a gas which has been compressed from a nozzle
      and blown into the liquid, is composed of a nozzle and the rotary
      body, which is provided with such suction effect gas into the
      liquid vigorously stirred Te, there is such as to mix the gas
      phase components in the liquid phase.<br>
      <br>
      When it is sprayed from the nozzle, the shape of the nozzle, the
      bubble miniaturization that can be sprayed into a liquid, it may
      be mixed with more oxygen for a long time stabilized in the
      solution.<br>
      <br>
      When you install the aeration tube of the porous body to the
      nozzle tip, the bubbles that are released into the liquid is
      miniaturization, dissolved amount of the water is increased.<br>
      <br>
      Furthermore, it collides with the rotary body bubbles, and is
      miniaturized, it is possible to further long-term stability.<br>
      <br>
      [0033]<br>
      Bubbles dispersed in liquid, it emerged over time, eventually
      returning to the gas phase.<br>
      <br>
      In order to improve the efficiency of air bubbles in contact with
      the surface of the photocatalyst 1, in view of the fact that
      bubbles floats, by disposing the photocatalyst one on top of the
      diffuser means 3, the bubbles contact the surface of the
      photocatalyst 1 it becomes easier to the reaction increases, it is
      possible to increase the production amount.<br>
      <br>
      Furthermore, the cell is arranged longer photocatalyst 1 in the
      vertical direction, the gas floats is possible to take a longer
      time in contact with the surface of the photocatalyst 1, it is
      possible to improve the reaction efficiency.<br>

      The reactive oxygen species produced by the water purification
      process of the present invention refers to those having or
      hydroxyl radicals, superoxide radicals, singlet oxygen, hydrogen
      peroxide, ozone, etc. The oxidizing action, such as reactive
      oxygen species.<br>
      <br>
      They oxidize organic compounds, decompose other, bacteria and
      fungi, protozoa, and targeted microorganisms such as viruses,
      these growth activities bacteriostatic and act to suppress the
      decomposition of the constituents are modified to work it is
      possible to obtain a bactericidal action to stop.<br>
      <br>
      [0035]<br>
      The term "antimicrobial" as used herein, refers to be sterilized
      and / or degrading bacteria in the liquid phase, preferably it
      refers to inhibiting the proliferation of reducing and / or
      bacteria in the bacterial concentration in the liquid phase.<br>
      <br>
      Specifically, it means that the antimicrobial component and fungi
      in the case of contact over 24 hours, the bacterial concentration
      in contact can be reduced two orders of magnitude more than the
      initial concentration.<br>
      <br>
      In the present invention, the subject of antimicrobial activity is
      not particularly limited, for example, bacteria, fungi, include
      viruses such as, from the viewpoint of antibacterial activity, the
      bacteria are preferred.<br>
      <br>
      As the bacteria, for example, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus
      aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, MRSA, Bacillus cereus, include
      Klebsiella pneumoniae.<br>
      <br>
      [0036]<br>
      Reactive oxygen species, for oxidizing power is strong, C-C bond
      is the basic skeleton of the organic matter (about binding energy
      347kJ / mol) and, C-H bonds (binding energy about 415kJ / mol),
      or, C = C bond the binding of such π bond (bond energy of about
      285kJ / mol) has been known to be cleaved by oxidation.<br>
      <br>
      To disconnect the coupling, higher dissociation energy than the
      binding energy is required.<br>
      <br>
      For example, strong oxidizing potential of the hydroxyl radicals
      are reactive oxygen species it is about 2.8V, because the
      dissociation energy of about 504kJ / mol, it is possible to
      oxidative decompose by cleaving the C-C bonds.<br>
      <br>
      Such oxidizing agents are, because energy is large, contrary,
      there is a property that is very short unstable life
      (approximately 1 millisecond).<br>
      <br>
      [0037]<br>
      Hydrogen peroxide is one of the reactive oxygen species, the
      oxidation potential is 1.77V, the dissociation energy is 319kJ /
      mol.<br>
      <br>
      In this case, it can not be cut is lower than the energy that
      cleaves C-C bonds, it is possible to disconnect the π bonds of C =
      C double bonds.<br>
      <br>
      In the case of large organic relatively molecular weight such as
      proteins and enzymes, but in order to fulfill the original
      function is an important three-dimensional conformation, active
      substances such as hydrogen peroxide which by the strong oxidizing
      power conformation of the denatured, it is possible to extinguish
      the original functions, it is possible to obtain a disinfection
      effect and antiviral effect.<br>
      <br>
      The hydrogen peroxide minute oxidation potential is low, the
      stability is increased as compared with the hydroxyl radical there
      is a property that the life is long (about one hour or more).<br>
      <br>
      It is possible to provide an antibacterial effect to the remote
      location in the liquid phase.<br>
      <br>
      [0038]<br>
      These antimicrobial components are bacteria, it is reacted with
      the cells of microorganisms such as fungi or protozoa, all of
      these, or by oxidizing a part express antimicrobial activity.<br>

      oxide is firmly bonded, for example, it is possible to improve the
      promoting effect of the antimicrobial activity and photocatalytic
      reaction, ionic bonding between the titanium oxide and the halogen
      is analyzed by photoelectron spectrometer it can.<br>
      <br>
      For example, if the halogen is fluorine, when analyzing the
      halogen-containing titanium oxide with a photoelectron
      spectroscopic analyzer, a peak top of fluorine 1s orbital (F1s) is
      refers to the case shown a spectrum in the range of 683eV~686eV.<br>
      <br>
      This fluorine and the values ​​of the peak top of the titanium

      radiation is strong, it is preferable less susceptible to chemical
      attack by organic synthetic fiber and acid binder than paper.<br>
      <br>
      The glass fibers because it has a light transmission and light
      scattering properties, when it is irradiated with light in the
      halogen-containing titanium oxide, can be irradiated efficiently
      light.<br>

      Although the fiber shape is not particularly limited, than single
      fibers, it is preferably formed by a fiber bundle by bundling a
      plurality of short fibers of glass with a diameter of 4~9μm.<br>
      <br>
      Fiber bundles may be used by bundling any number of the order of
      this fifty ～6400.<br>
      <br>
      When carrying the titanium oxide in the fiber bundle is a bundle
      of several short fiberglass and secured titanium oxide particles
      are crowded or adhered enters between the fibers.<br>
      <br>
      As compared with the case of carrying the titanium oxide on the
      surface of the thick single fiber, it is possible to hold the
      titanium oxide between the fibers, it is possible to increase the
      supported amount.<br>
      <br>
      Also, titanium oxide particles that has entered between the fibers
      as well are firmly immobilized by caught in the fibers, to obtain
      the effect of hard to fall off because the impact is transmitted
      through the fiber even if an impact is applied from the outside it
      can.<br>
      <br>
      [0055]<br>
      If you are using a binder, Na2O, alkali silicate consisting of
      silicic acid salts such as K2O, LiO2, silica sol, alumina sol,
      inorganic colloids, such as zirconia sol, silica, silicon, and its
      hydrolyzate alkoxides such as titanium and the like .<br>
      <br>
      Incidentally, alkali components such as Na lowers the
      crystallinity of the titanium oxide (IV), since it may degrade
      performance, as the binder, it is preferable main component is
      SiO2, silica sol or silica alkoxide such as the kind of
      hydrolyzate is preferred.<br>

      [0056]<br>
      The alkoxides of silicon, methoxy polysiloxane is
      tetraethoxysilane and its polymers, ethoxy polysiloxane, butoxy
      polysiloxanes, and lithium silicate. Examples of the alkoxides of
      titanium, tetra propoxy titanium and its polymers such as is it
      like.<br>
      <br>
      These metal alkoxides can be hydrolyzed by water and an acid, it
      can be used as a binder.<br>
      <br>
      If the titanium alkoxide, by heating treatment, it can have a
      photocatalytic activity in itself.<br>

      The binder is preferably acidic, silicon, etc. the hydrolyzed
      material and the acidic silica sol with an acid titanium, alumina
      sol and the like.<br>
      <br>
      Silicon, in the case of hydrolyzing the titanium in acid,
      hydrochloric acid, it is preferable to adjust the pH to 1-5 by
      using a sulfuric acid.<br>
      <br>
      When using a silica sol, pH2~4, it is preferably of about the
      particle size 10~50nm.<br>
      <br>
      When the pH is used a neutral or alkaline silica sol to cause
      gelation upon the addition of titanium oxide containing a halogen,
      it is often difficult to be uniformly supported on a substrate.<br>
      [0058]<br>
      <br>
      Na, the cationic component, such as K, NH4 is contained in the
      binder, by adsorption to the progression and titanium (IV) oxide
      surface of the reaction with the halogen, there is a decrease in
      the antibacterial performance occurs, it said positive ion
      component is better as low as possible.<br>
      <br>
      For example, if it contains Na in the binder solution is
      preferably Na concentration is less more than 0wt% 0.05wt% as
      Na2O.<br>
      <br>
      [0059]<br>
      It is preferably a 10~900g / m2 as the basis weight of the glass
      fiber fabric, in order to facilitate the manufacture it is
      preferable to select one of 100~400g / m2.<br>
      <br>
      Also, weaving the fabric, plain weave, twill, satin, leno, etc.

      viewpoint of shape stability.<br>
      <br>
      Fiber bundle of vertical and horizontal as the density of the yarn
      is 20 to 40 present / 25mm, thickness is 0.1~2mm, more tensile
      strength of 100N / 25mm are preferred.<br>
      <br>
      [0060]<br>
      As a method for carrying the halogen-containing titanium oxide to
      the substrate, a dip coating, a spray and the like,
      halogen-containing titanium oxide can be any means as long
      immobilized on a substrate.<br>
      <br>
      If the supported amount is sufficient in one process may be
      repeated a plurality of processing steps.<br>
      <br>
      Furthermore, after carrying, dryer may be firmly immobilized on
      the substrate and thereby shrink the binder by heating about
      0.01-5 hours at a temperature of about 50~700 ℃, at 90~150 ℃ 0. 1
      hour of heating is more preferable.<br>
      <br>
      When performing such a heat drying treatment, it is preferable to
      constitute the principal component of the base glass, ceramics.<br>
      <br>
      [0061]<br>
      The particle diameter of the halogen-containing titanium oxide,
      the smaller than the diameter of the fibers are preferred.<br>
      <br>
      Since the halogen-containing titanium oxide is less than the
      diameter of the fibers, the halogen-containing titanium oxide is
      easily enter the stitches and the overlapping portion between the
      fibers, it is possible to obtain an effect of being firmly fixed.<br>
      <br>
      As a result, it is possible to increase the supported amount of
      the halogen-containing titanium oxide.<br>
      <br>
      The particle diameter of the halogen-containing titanium oxide,
      but in fact often is in the secondary particles of about 0.1~100μm
      primary particles by aggregation of about 6~100nm as primary
      particle size.<br>
      <br>
      The particle diameter of the halogen-containing titanium oxide
      referred to herein indicates a state of the secondary particles,
      it is necessary that a halogen-containing titanium oxide is easily
      enters the stitches and the overlapping portions of the fibers
      when dispersed in knitting.<br>
      <br>

      In addition, in the iodine compounds, and the like, such as
      potassium iodide.<br>
      In the bromine compound, potassium bromide, calcium bromide,
      ammonium bromide, and a bromide such as sodium bromide.<br>
      <br>
      These also are mixed the amount that can be dissolved in a
      solution of an oxo acid, it is used by dissolving.<br>
      <br>
      For example, it can be dissolved to a concentration of about 10
      wt% 0.01 wt%, are used.<br>

      solution, if the powder centrifugation or filtration, and, if a
      state of being immobilized on a substrate, after pulling, the
      residual liquid was dried at a low temperature of 100 ℃ me
      eliminated.<br>
      <br>
      In this way, it affixed to the oxo acids and halogen In, instead
      of a chemical bond with titanium oxide, and the pores of the
      titanium oxide, it is presumed to be in a state where it is
      adsorbed at random on the surface.<br>

      Provided are a photocatalytic material that improves a
      decomposition performance and a decomposition rate, as well as a
      photocatalytic member and a purification device in which the
      photocatalytic material is used. The photocatalytic member is a
      photocatalytic member (1) that includes a substrate (10) and a
      photocatalyst layer (11) formed on a surface of the substrate
      (10), wherein the photocatalyst layer (11) contains a titanium
      oxide photocatalyst and zeolite, the titanium oxide photocatalyst
      containing at least an anatase-type titanium oxide and fluorine,
      in which a content of the fluorine in the titanium oxide
      photocatalyst is 2.5 wt % to 3.5 wt %, and 90 wt % or more of the
      fluorine is chemically bonded to the anatase-type titanium oxide.<br>
      <br>
      <b>TECHNICAL FIELD</b><br>
      <br>
      [0001] The present invention relates to a photocatalytic material
      containing titanium oxide, as well as a photocatalytic member and
      a purification device using the photocatalytic material.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND ART</b><br>
      <br>
      [0002] Recently, titanium oxide photocatalysts have been put into
      practical use in various situations, for the purposes of
      sterilization, antifouling, and the like. The use of the same now
      is not limited to outdoor use, but is spreading to indoor use for
      the purposes of sterilization, deodorization, and the like.
      Because of this, a titanium oxide has been demanded that can be
      excited efficiently even by an energy in a visible region in a
      titanium oxide excitation system that conventionally has required
      an energy in an ultraviolet region. Such demand often is met by a
      titanium oxide supporting a foreign element or forming a solid
      solution with a foreign element. A wavelength for exciting the
      titanium oxide can be controlled depending on the type of a
      foreign element to be added.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] However, in many cases, such a treatment that causes
      titanium oxide to support a foreign element or causes titanium
      oxide to form a solid solution with a foreign element
      significantly reduces an efficiency of excitation inherent to the
      titanium oxide. In return for the excitability with respect to
      visible light, an effect to be achieved originally by ultraviolet
      rays is reduced, which results in a decrease in activity in many
      cases.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Conventionally, it is known that the photocatalytic
      activity of titanium oxide is enhanced by elimination of lattice
      defects in titanium oxide using a mineral acid or the like
      (Non-Patent Document 1). Especially, it is known that a hydroxyl
      group on a surface of titanium oxide can be replaced easily with
      fluorine. Therefore, there have been proposals to treat titanium
      oxide with a fluorine compound such as hydrofluoric acid so as to
      enhance the photocatalytic performance in the titanium oxide
      excitation system using ultraviolet rays (Non-Patent Document 2,
      Patent Documents 1 and 2). However, some types of titanium oxide
      treated as above did not fully exhibit the effect.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] On the other hand, regarding deodorization and purification
      of air, a technology that is capable of promptly deodorizing and
      decomposing four major odorous components—acetaldehyde, acetic
      acid, ammonia and sulfur compound gas (e.g. hydrogen sulfide and
      methyl mercaptan)—has been demanded. Exemplary methods of the
      above technology are as follows: a method of concentrating and
      storing odor using an adsorbent such as activated carbon or
      zeolite; and a method of directly decomposing odor by thermal
      decomposition, thermal catalytic decomposition, ozone
      decomposition, plasma discharge decomposition, photocatalyst
      decomposition, or the like.<br>

      </b><b>Problem to be Solved by the Invention</b><br>
      <br>
      [0006] However, the method using an adsorbent only provides poor
      adsorbability with respect to acetaldehyde, which is highly
      contained in mainstream smoke and secondary smoke of tobacco
      products, and therefore has a problem that odor once adsorbed is
      again released. Moreover, the direct decomposition method using
      thermal decomposition or catalytic decomposition has problems in
      heat generation and power consumption; ozone decomposition and
      plasma discharge decomposition have a problem in safety because of
      ozone generation; and photocatalyst decomposition has a problem in
      the decomposition rate. Especially, in photocatalyst
      decomposition, as compared with the other methods, a superior
      ability of eliminating acetaldehyde is exhibited owing to the gas
      adsorbability originally possessed by titanium oxide used as a
      photocatalyst material, but the decomposition rate is insufficient
      for practical use.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] Therefore, the present invention provides a photocatalytic
      material containing titanium oxide that is capable of improving a
      decomposition performance and a decomposition rate, as well as a
      photocatalytic member and a purification device using the
      photocatalytic material.<br>

      <b>DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b><br>
      <br>
      [0048] A photocatalytic material of the present invention is a
      photocatalytic material containing a titanium oxide photocatalyst
      and zeolite, the titanium oxide photocatalyst containing at least
      an anatase-type titanium oxide (hereinafter also referred to as
      “titanium oxide” simply) and fluorine, wherein a content of the
      fluorine in the titanium oxide photocatalyst is 2.5 wt % to 3.5 wt
      %, and 90 wt % or more of the fluorine is chemically bonded to the
      above anatase-type titanium oxide. With the photocatalytic
      material of the present invention, the performance of decomposing
      organic molecules (e.g. odorous components) can be improved, with
      an adsorbing function of zeolite. Further, since it contains the
      titanium oxide photocatalyst, the photocatalytic activity can be
      improved. Therefore, an odorous component decomposition rate, for
      example, can be improved.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] In the photocatalytic material of the present invention,
      for example, from the viewpoint of maintaining the photocatalytic
      activity and the deodorizing power, zeolite mentioned above
      preferably contains at least one of a mordenite-form zeolite and a
      ZSM-5-form zeolite.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] In the photocatalytic material of the present invention,
      for example, from the viewpoint of maintaining the photocatalytic
      activity and the deodorizing power, zeolite mentioned above
      preferably contains silica and alumina, and a molar component
      ratio between silica and alumina (silica/alumina) in the zeolite
      preferably is 240 or more.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] In the present invention, a photocatalyst refers to a
      substance that shows catalytic activity when irradiated with light
      such as ultraviolet rays, and preferably, to a substance that,
      when irradiated with light, can decompose and eliminate various
      organic and inorganic compounds and perform sterilization. The
      titanium oxide photocatalyst of the present invention preferably
      can be used for, for example, decomposing and eliminating odorous
      components such as acetaldehyde and methyl mercaptans; sterilizing
      and eliminating fungi and algae; oxidatively decomposing and
      eliminating nitrogen oxides; and imparting an anti-fouling
      function by causing glass to have ultra-hydrophilic properties.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] In the present invention, examples tithe photocatalytic
      activity include a function of decomposing organic compounds
      oxidatively when the titanium oxide photocatalyst is irradiated
      with ultraviolet rays. The photocatalytic activity of the present
      invention can be evaluated by, for example, a carbon dioxide
      generation rate that indicate a rate at which carbon dioxide is
      generated along with the oxidation of organic compounds when the
      organic compounds in a gaseous or liquid state and the titanium
      oxide photocatalyst coexist and are irradiated with ultraviolet
      rays of 400 nm or less. Preferably, the photocatalytic activity
      can be evaluated by, for example, a carbon dioxide generation rate
      at which carbon dioxide is generated by the oxidative
      decomposition of acetaldehyde. The reaction is expressed by a
      reaction formula (I) shown below<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      CH3CHO+0.5O2→CH3COOH+2O2→2CO2+2H2O  Reaction formula (1)<br>
      <br>
      [0053] The titanium oxide photocatalyst used in the present
      invention contains fluorine in the range of 2.5 wt % to 3.5 wt %
      in element content; more preferably, in the range of 2.7 wt % to
      3.3 wt %; and further preferably, in the range of 2.9 wt % to 3.1
      wt %. Setting the content of fluorine to 2.5 wt % or more makes it
      possible to improve the photocatalytic activity while setting the
      content of fluorine to 3.5 wt % or less makes it possible to
      suppress a decline in the photocatalytic activity.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] The reason why the above-titanium oxide photocatalyst
      improves the photocatalytic activity is uncertain, but it is
      assumed as follows: by the setting of the content of fluorine at
      2.5 wt % or more, the fluorine, which has a large
      electronegativity, comes to stay on a surface of the titanium
      oxide. Owing to the electron-withdrawing function of the fluorine
      located on the surface of the titanium oxide, for example, a
      hydroxyl group located adjacent thereto is activated, whereby a
      hydroxyl radical tends to be generated. As a result, the
      photocatalytic reaction can be accelerated. Although the
      photocatalytic reaction can develop even when the content of
      fluorine is 2.5 wt % or less, the effect of accelerating the
      photocatalytic reaction can be enhanced greatly when the content
      of fluorine is 2.5 wt % or more.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] Further, the reason why the above-titanium oxide
      photocatalyst can suppress a decline in the photocatalytic
      activity is uncertain, but it is assumed as follows: by setting
      the content of fluorine at 3.5 wt % or less, for example, the
      amount of fluorine covering the surface of the titanium oxide can
      be kept in an adequate range, whereby the number of hydroxyl
      groups required for the photocatalytic reaction can be ensured.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] Furthermore, in the titanium oxide photocatalyst used in
      the present invention, 90 wt % or more of fluorine is chemically
      bonded to the titanium oxide. This allows the fluorine to exhibit
      its own electron-withdrawing function effectively, whereby the
      photocatalytic reaction accelerating effect can be enhanced.
      Specifically, the above chemical bond preferably is anionic bond
      because in such a case fluorine and titanium oxide are bonded to
      each other firmly and the photocatalytic reaction accelerating
      effect is enhanced further. It should be noted that the ionic bond
      of fluorine and titanium oxide can be determined in a measurement
      using a photoelectron spectroscopic analyzer, which is described
      later.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] In the above-described titanium oxide photocatalyst, from
      the viewpoint of accelerating the photocatalytic reaction, a
      proportion of fluorine chemically bonded to the titanium oxide is
      90 wt % or more of the entirety of the fluorine in the titanium
      oxide photocatalyst preferably 95 wt % or more; and more
      preferably 100 wt %, that is, the entirety of the fluorine
      contained in the titanium oxide photocatalyst is chemically bonded
      to the titanium oxide. In the titanium oxide photocatalyst of the
      present invention, the content of fluorine chemically bonded to
      titanium oxide is, for example, 2.35 wt % to 3.5 wt %; preferably
      2.5 wt % to 3.5 wt %; and more preferably 2.5 wt % to 3.3 wt %.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] In the present invention, a chemical bond between titanium
      oxide and fluorine refers to a state in which titanium oxide and
      fluorine are chemically bonded to each other, and preferably, to a
      state in which titanium oxide and fluorine are, not supported or
      mixed, but bonded to each other at the atomic level. In the
      present invention, chemically-bonded fluorine refers to, tithe
      fluorine contained in the titanium oxide photocatalyst, the
      fluorine that is not eluted into water, for example. The amount of
      such fluorine chemically bonded to the titanium oxide can be
      measured by the following method: first, a titanium oxide
      photocatalyst is dispersed into water; then the dispersion
      solution is kept at pH=3 or less, or pH=10 or more with a pH
      adjuster (e.g. hydrochloric add, ammonia water); the amount of
      fluorine ion eluted into water is measured by a colorimetric
      titration, or the like; and the above eluted amount is subtracted
      from the total amount of the fluorine contained in the titanium
      oxide photocatalyst. Thus, the amount of the fluorine chemically
      bonded to the titanium oxide can be determined. The amount of
      fluorine ion eluted into water can be measured as in Examples
      described later.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] In the above-described titanium oxide photocatalyst, it is
      preferable that at least a part of the fluorine chemically bonded
      to the titanium oxide is located on surfaces of titanium oxide.
      Because the photocatalytic reaction mainly occurs on surfaces of
      titanium oxide, if the fluorine is located on surfaces of titanium
      oxide, the photocatalytic reaction accelerating effect is enhanced
      further. It should be noted that the amount of fluorine chemically
      bonded to the titanium oxide on surfaces of the titanium oxide can
      be determined in a measurement using a photoelectron spectroscopic
      analyzer, as in Examples described later.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] In the present specification, “titanium oxide and fluorine
      are bonded ionically” refers to a case in which, when the titanium
      oxide photocatalyst is analyzed by a photoelectron spectroscopic
      analyzer, the catalyst shows a spectrum such that a peak-top of 1s
      orbital of fluorine (F1s) appears in a range from 683 eV to 686
      eV. This is ascribed to titanium fluoride, which results from
      ionic bonding of fluorine and titanium, having a peak-top value
      falling in the above range.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] In the case where the above-described titanium oxide
      photocatalyst includes sodium, and where a content of sodium in
      the entirety of the titanium oxide photocatalyst is assumed to be
      A wt % and a content of fluorine in the entirety of the titanium
      oxide photocatalyst is assumed to be B wt %, a ratio A/B is
      preferably 0.01 or less; more preferably 0.005 or less; and
      further preferably 0.001 or less. If the ratio A/B is 0.01 or
      less, a decline in the photocatalytic activity can be suppressed.
      The reason is uncertain, yet it is assumed that, for example, a
      decrease in the amount of sodium with respect to fluorine causes
      the decline in the photocatalytic activity due to the reaction
      between sodium and fluorine to be suppressed. It should be noted
      that it is most preferable that the content of sodium is 0, that
      is, it is most preferable that the ratio A/B is 0. Regarding
      impurities other than sodium also, it is preferable that there are
      less impurities; and it is most preferable that there are no
      impurities. Examples of an element that can be impurities include
      potassium, aluminum, and transition metals.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] Regarding the titanium oxide photocatalyst used in the
      present invention, a specific surface area thereof is preferably
      in a range of 200 m&lt;2&gt;/g to 350 m&lt;2&gt;/g; and more
      preferably, in a range of 250 m&lt;2&gt;/g to 350 m&lt;2&gt;/g.
      Here, in the present invention, the specific surface area refers
      to a value of a surface area per 1 g of the titanium oxide
      photocatalyst in powder form measured by a BET method (nitrogen
      adsorption-desorption method). When the specific surface area is
      200 m&lt;2&gt;/g or more, the area in contact with an object to be
      decomposed can be large. Further, in the case where an
      anatase-type titanium oxide is used, and if the specific surface
      area thereof is 350 m&lt;2&gt;/g or less, a photocatalytic
      reaction with higher efficiency can be achieved compared to the
      case where an amorphous titanium oxide is used. Here, the
      anatase-type titanium oxide refers to a titanium oxide showing a
      diffraction peak at a diffraction angle 2θ=25.5 degrees in a
      measurement with a powder X-ray diffractometer using copper
      electrodes as working electrodes.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] The titanium oxide photocatalyst used in the present
      invention can be produced through, for example, the following
      producing method. First, a pH of an aqueous dispersion solution of
      titanium oxide is adjusted with an alkaline solution until the pH
      thereof becomes in a range of 7.5 to 9.5, and thereafter the
      solution is filtered. Subsequently, the filtration residue
      obtained by the filtration is re-dispersed into water. Then, a
      fluorine compound is added to the re-dispersion solution obtained
      by the re-dispersion so that a suspension is obtained, and
      thereafter, a pH of the suspension is adjusted with an acid until
      the pH thereof becomes 3 or less, whereby the titanium oxide and
      the fluorine compound are caused to react with each other. Then,
      the reaction product obtained by the reaction is washed. With the
      present method, the above-described titanium oxide photocatalyst
      can be produced easily. In this method, if the amount of added
      fluorine compound is increased, the titanium oxide dissolves
      itself. Therefore, the content of fluorine in the titanium oxide
      photocatalyst can be controlled easily to 3.5 wt % or lower.
      Further, in the case where the reaction product is washed with
      water, the water washing preferably is carried out until an
      electric conductivity of water used in the washing becomes 1 mS/cm
      or less, as an index for washing. The water used for washing in
      the present invention refers to, for example, water that is used
      for washing a reaction product and thereafter is collected. The
      electric conductivity can be measured in a manner as in Examples
      to be described later.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] In the present method, the aforementioned re-dispersion
      solution contains an anatase-type titanium oxide having such a
      surface acidity that an amount of adsorbed n-butylamine per 1 gram
      of the titanium oxide is, for example, 8 μmol or less. Thus, using
      as a starting material the anatase-type titanium oxide having a
      surface that is almost basic, a titanium oxide photocatalyst can
      be prepared that contains fluorine in a range of 2.5 wt % to 3.5
      wt % as an element. Therefore, in the foregoing producing method,
      the steps of “adjusting a pH of an aqueous dispersion solution of
      a titanium oxide with an alkaline solution until the pH thereof
      becomes in a range of 7.5 to 9.5, and thereafter filtering the
      solution” and “re-dispersing the filtration residue obtained by
      the filtration into water” may not be used, but instead, an
      aqueous dispersion solution of an anatase-type titanium oxide that
      adsorbs n-butylamine in an amount of 8 μmol/g or less may be used.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] Therefore, the titanium oxide photocatalyst containing
      fluorine can be produced through the following steps: mixing a
      fluorine compound and an aqueous dispersion solution of an
      anatase-type titanium oxide that adsorbs n-butylamine in an amount
      of 8 μmol/g or less whereby a mixed solution containing titanium
      oxide and fluorine and having a pH of 3 or less is prepared, so
      that the titanium oxide and the fluorine compound are caused to
      react with each other; and washing the reaction product obtained.<br>
      <br>
      [0066] As the anatase-type titanium oxide that adsorbs
      n-butylamine in an amount of 8 μmol/g or less, for example, SSP-25
      manufactured by SAKAI Chemical Industry Co., Ltd. can be used. As
      the aqueous dispersion solution of the same, for example, CSB-M
      manufactured by SAKAI Chemical Industry Co., Ltd. can be used.<br>
      <br>
      [0067] Here, the method for measuring the amount of adsorbed
      n-butylamine per 1 grain of titanium oxide is as follows. One gram
      of a titanium oxide sample dried at 130° C. for 2 hours is weighed
      in a 50-mL stoppered Erlenmeyer flask, and 30 mL of a n-butylamine
      solution diluted with methanol to have a normality of 0.003 N is
      added to the foregoing titanium oxide sample. Then, this is
      subjected to ultrasonic dispersion for 1 hour, and is left to
      stand for 10 hours. 10 mL of the supernatant fluid of the same is
      sampled. The sampled supernatant fluid is subjected to
      potentiometric titration using a perchloric acid solution diluted
      with methanol to have a normality of 0.003 N, and from the
      titrated amount of at the point of neutralization, the amount of
      adsorbed n-butylamine can be determined.<br>
      <br>
      [0068] In the present method, the anatase-type titanium oxide
      having such a surface acidity that an amount of adsorbed
      n-butylamine per 1 gram of titanium oxide is 8 μmol or less
      preferably contains sodium as impurities in an amount of 1000 ppm
      by weight (wt ppm) or less. If the content of sodium as impurities
      is 1000 wt ppm or less, the deterioration of photocatalytic
      activity can be suppressed. The reason for this is uncertain, but
      it is assumed that, for example, sodium reacts with fluorine,
      whereby the inhibition of the reaction between fluorine and
      titanium oxide can be prevented.<br>
      <br>
      [0069] Further, as an alkaline solution used at the stage of
      preparation of the starting material, and as additives to be added
      as required after the reaction with fluorine, those which
      substantially do not contain sodium are desirable. Examples of the
      alkaline solution include ammonia water, an aqueous ammonium
      carbonate solution, and an aqueous hydrazine solution.<br>
      <br>
      [0070] In the present method, in the step of re-dispersing the
      filtration residue obtained by the filtration into water, the
      filtration residue preferably is in a state of not being dried
      when being re-dispersed into water. This is because the
      dispersibility of the filtration residue in the re-dispersion
      solution can be improved.<br>
      <br>
      [0071] In the present invention, a specific method for obtaining
      the re-dispersion solution is not limited particularly. The
      re-dispersion solution may be prepared by, for example, any one of
      the methods shown below, or may be prepared by, for example,
      dispersing a powder-form titanium oxide available from the market
      (e.g., SSP-25 manufactured by SAKAI Chemical Industry Co., Ltd.)
      into pure water.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0072] Method 1</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0073] An aqueous titanyl sulfate solution is heated to a
      temperature in a range of 80° C. to 100° C. so as to be
      hydrolyzed, and a slurry aqueous solution of white precipitate
      thus obtained is cooled. The pH of the obtained white precipitate
      slurry (aqueous dispersion solution of titanium oxide) is adjusted
      with ammonia water added to the slurry, until the pH becomes in a
      range of 7.5 to 9.5. Then, the slurry is filtered. The filtration
      residue thus obtained is washed with water thoroughly so that
      salts as impurities are removed. A cake made of this filtration
      residue thus obtained is re-dispersed in pure water, whereby a
      re-dispersion solution of an anatase-type titanium oxide can be
      obtained.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0074] Method 2</b><br>
      <br>
      [0075] After ammonia water is added to an aqueous titanyl sulfate
      solution, a pH of the obtained aqueous dispersion solution of
      titanium oxide is adjusted with ammonia water added to the
      dispersion solution until the pH becomes in a range of 7.5 to 9.5.
      Then, the slum is filtered. The filtration residue thus obtained
      is washed with water thoroughly so that salts as impurities are
      removed. A cake made of this filtration residue thus obtained is
      heated at 100° C., aged, and re-dispersed in pure water, whereby a
      re-dispersion solution of an anatase-type titanium oxide can be
      obtained.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0076] Method 3</b><br>
      <br>
      [0077] An aqueous titanium tetrachloride solution is heated so as
      to be hydrolyzed, and the pH of the obtained white precipitate
      slurry (aqueous dispersion solution of titanium oxide) is adjusted
      with ammonia water added to the slurry until the pH becomes in a
      range of 7.5 to 9.5. Then, the slurry is filtered The filtration
      residue thus obtained is washed with water thoroughly so that
      salts as impurities are removed. A cake made of this filtration
      residue thus obtained is heated to a temperature in a range of 80°
      C. to 100° C., aged, and re-dispersed in pure water, whereby a
      re-dispersion solution of an anatase-type titanium oxide can be
      obtained.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0078] Method 4</b><br>
      <br>
      [0079] Titanium tetraalkoxide is hydrolyzed in a solvent, and a pH
      of a suspension of the precipitate obtained (aqueous dispersion
      solution of titanium oxide) is adjusted by adding ammonia water to
      the suspension, until the pH becomes in a range of 7.5 to 93.
      Then, the suspension is filtered. The filtration residue thus
      obtained is washed with water thoroughly so that salts as
      impurities are removed. A cake made of this filtration residue
      thus obtained is heated to a temperature in a range of 80° C. to
      100° C., aged, and re-dispersed in pure water whereby a
      re-dispersion solution of an anatase-type titanium oxide can be
      obtained.<br>
      <br>
      [0080] The crystallinity of the anatase-type titanium oxide in the
      re-dispersion solution thus obtained preferably is such that a
      diffraction peak appears at a diffraction angle 2θ=25.5°, when it
      is measured by drying the re-dispersion solution at 50° C. under a
      reduced pressure so that dry powder is obtained, and measuring the
      crystallinity of the powder with a powder X-ray diffractometer
      using copper electrodes as working electrodes. This is because
      titanium oxide having such a characteristic is a crystallized
      anatase titanium oxide, and if this is used as a starting
      material, the photocatalytic activity can be improved.<br>
      <br>
      [0081] In the present method, the fluorine compound to be added to
      the re-dispersion solution is not particularly limited, but
      examples of the same include ammonium fluoride, potassium
      fluoride, sodium fluoride, and hydrofluoric acid. Among these,
      ammonium fluoride, potassium fluoride, and hydrofluoric acid are
      preferred. When a fluorine compound is added to a re-dispersion
      solution, it is necessary to add a fluorine compound at least so
      that an amount of fluorine as an element becomes 2.5 wt % or more
      with respect to the titanium oxide photocatalyst obtained.<br>
      <br>
      [0082] Examples of the method for adding the fluorine compound
      include a method of adding the above-described fluorine compound
      in a solid state to the re-dispersion solution, a method of adding
      an aqueous solution of the above-described fluorine compound to
      the re-dispersion solution, and a method of bubbling fluorine gas
      or hydrofluoric acid gas in the re-dispersion solution. Among
      these, from the viewpoint of cost efficiency and handleability,
      the method of adding the solid fluorine compound to the
      re-dispersion solution, and the method of adding an aqueous
      solution of the fluorine compound to the re-dispersion solution
      are preferable. Further, from the viewpoint of the efficiency of
      reaction between titanium oxide and fluorine, it is preferable
      that the re-dispersion solution obtained and the fluorine compound
      are mixed, without a hydrothermal treatment being carried out
      under such conditions that a specific surface area would not
      decrease. The time for the treatment for the fluorine compound is
      not limited particularly, but is preferably in a range of 5
      minutes to 90 minutes. The time more preferably is in a range of
      30 minutes to 60 minutes. In the case where the time is set at 5
      minutes or more, the fluorine compound added is dispersed
      sufficiently. In the case where the time is set at 90 minutes or
      less, titanium oxide having high activity can be obtained.
      Further, the temperature for the treatment of the fluorine
      compound preferably is 40° C. or lower. In the case where the
      temperature is set at 40° C. or lower, a decrease in the specific
      surface area of titanium oxide can be prevented. The temperature
      for the treatment of a fluorine compound normally is 10° C. or
      higher.<br>
      <br>
      [0083] In the present invention, examples of acid used for the
      adjustment of a pH include hydrochloric acid, nitric acid,
      sulfuric acid, and hydrofluoric acid. An upper limit of the pH of
      a suspension obtained by adding a fluorine compound to a
      re-dispersion solution of titanium oxide and a mixed solution
      containing the anatase-type titanium oxide and a fluorine compound
      is 3 or less. A lower limit of the pH of the suspension and the
      mixed solution is not limited particularly, but from the viewpoint
      of cost efficiency and handleability, the pH preferably is 1 or
      more.<br>
      <br>
      [0084] In the present invention, a reaction product obtained
      through the reaction step is washed with, for example, water. This
      makes it possible to remove fluorine that has not reacted with
      titanium oxide in the reaction step, unnecessary salts, dissolved
      impurities, and the like. Therefore, the photocatalytic activity
      can be improved.<br>
      <br>
      [0085] In the case where the washing is carried out with water
      (water washing), the washing preferably is carried out until an
      electric conductivity of water used in the washing becomes 1 mS/cm
      or less, as an index for washing. In the case where the washing is
      carried out until an electric conductivity of water used in the
      washing becomes 1 mS/cm or less, unnecessary salts, dissolved
      impurities, etc. can be removed adequately. Here, immediately
      after the treatment with a fluorine compound, the washing
      preferably is carried out with the treatment liquid with the same
      liquid composition, without the pH thereof being adjusted. This is
      because the washing with the treatment liquid with the same liquid
      composition makes it possible to remove impurities dissolved in
      the liquid easily, and hence, improves the photocatalytic
      activity. It should be noted that as the washing method, a method
      using a centrifuge, filtration equipment of any one of various
      types, a rotary washing machine or the like can be used, for
      example.<br>
      <br>
      [0086] In the present method, the titanium oxide photocatalyst
      obtained as described above may be subjected to a finishing
      treatment as required, depending on the use of the photocatalyst.
      For example, in the case where the photocatalyst is finished into
      a powder form through a drying step, it may be subjected to any
      conventionally known treatment for avoiding the aggregation caused
      by the drying, and any means for loosening aggregated powder may
      be used. In order to loosen powder aggregated due to the drying,
      any common grinder may be used, but the grinding has to be carried
      out under such conditions that the photocatalytic activity would
      not deteriorate. For example, in order to prevent titanium oxide
      crystals from being destroyed, the grinding power has to be
      decreased.<br>
      <br>
      [0087] Further, the titanium oxide photocatalyst having been
      washed through the above-described washing step may be dispersed
      in a solvent again so as to be used as an aqueous, oily, or
      emulsified dispersion solution. Here, a wet-type grinder may be
      used in order to loosen caking, but a type of equipment and
      conditions that would not deteriorate the photocatalytic activity
      have to be chosen, as described above. For example, in the case of
      a dispersing device using a grinding medium, the concentration of
      titanium oxide preferably is increased in order to prevent the
      mixing of impurities caused by the abrasion of the medium. A
      diameter of the medium preferably is decreased in order to avoid
      the destruction of crystals of titanium oxide caused by the impact
      of the medium.<br>
      <br>
      [0088] Additionally, a surface treatment may be performed as
      required, depending on the use of the photocatalyst. In this case,
      examples of a commonly known method for this include a method of
      causing titanium oxide to support, on its surfaces, an adsorption
      component or an adsorbent such as silica, apatite, or zeolite, or
      contrarily, a method of causing titanium oxide to be supported by
      an adsorbent. In the case where a surface treatment is applied in
      this manner, materials used in the treatment have to be selected
      so that no deterioration of the photocatalytic activity should be
      caused or the deterioration ratio should fall in a tolerable
      range.<br>
      <br>
      [0089] Zeolite used in the present invention is, for example, a
      zeolite in which silica and alumina are bonded with each other via
      oxygen, and typical crystalline forms thereof are the A form, the
      X form, the beta form, the ferrite form, the mordenite form, the L
      form, and the Y form. Various types of zeolite having different
      pore diameters and different shapes can be synthesized by varying
      the molar component ratio between silica and alumina (hereinafter
      this ratio also is referred to as “silica/alumina ratio”) and the
      calcining temperature. It should be noted that a normal zeolite
      has a particle diameter of 1 to 20 μm and a pore diameter of 0.1
      nm to 1 nm.<br>
      <br>
      [0090] In view of the photocatalytic activity and the filter
      recycling to be described later, the mordenite-form zeolite or the
      ZSM-5-form zeolite is used preferably as the zeolite. The
      mordenite-form zeolite (structure code: MOR) generally refers to
      an orthorhombic-system zeolite that has a unit cell composition of
      Na8[Al8Si40O96].24H2O and 12-membered-ring two-dimensional pores
      (effective diameter: 0.6 nm). The ZSM-5-form zeolite (structure
      code: MFI) generally refers to an orthorhombic-system zeolite that
      has a unit cell composition of Nan[AlnSi96-nO191].xH2O (n&lt;27)
      and 10-membered-ring two-dimensional pores (effective diameter:
      0.6 nm).<br>
      <br>
      [0091] In the present invention, the function of zeolite is to
      cause odorous components to get closer to titanium oxide having
      photocatalytic activity so as to concentrate the odorous
      components. Therefore, zeolite that exhibits higher performance of
      adsorbing odorous components is used preferably. Particularly,
      zeolite capable of adsorbing acetaldehyde is desirable. This is
      because, among odorous components, acetaldehyde is a component
      that cannot be adsorbed fully by conventional active carbon and is
      contained in various types of offensively odorous components. For
      example, a high-silica/alumina-ratio zeolite is preferable, which
      exhibits high ability of adsorbing acetaldehyde, and the
      mordenite-form zeolite having a crystal structure with a pore
      diameter of about 0.5 nm is more preferable. Further, in order to
      enhance the odorous component adsorbing property, the
      silica/alumina ratio of zeolite is, for example, 150 or more, and
      from the viewpoint of further enhancing the photocatalytic
      activity, it preferably is 200 or more, more preferably 240 or
      more, further preferably 1500 or more, and still further
      preferably 1890 or more. The upper limit of the silica/alumina
      ratio is, for example, 10000 or less. The pore diameter of zeolite
      is, for example, 7 Å or less, and from the viewpoint of enhancing
      the performance of adsorbing organic molecules, it preferably is 4
      to 6 Å. The pore diameter of zeolite can be measured by, for
      example, image observation with a transmission electron microscope
      (TEM).<br>
      <br>
      [0092] As zeolite, commercially available zeolite may be used
      Examples of the commercially available zeolite include HSZ-690HOA
      (manufactured by Tosoh Corporation, mordenite form, silica/alumina
      ratio: 240, average particle diameter: 13 μm, cation type: H,
      specific surface area (BET); 450 m&lt;2&gt;/g); HSZ-890HOA
      (manufactured by Tosoh Corporation, ZSM-5 form, silica/alumina
      ratio: 1500 to 2000 (average: 1890), average particle diameter: 8
      to 14 pun, cation type: H, specific surface area (BET): 280 to 330
      m&lt;2&gt;/g); ABSCENTS (TM)-1000 (manufactured by Union Showa
      K.K., average particle diameter: 3 to 5 μm, cation type: Na);
      ABSCENTS (TM)-2000 (manufactured by Union Showa K.K., average
      particle diameter; 3 to 5 am, cation type: Na); Smellrite (TM)
      (manufactured by Union Showa K.K., average particle diameter: 3 to
      5 μm, cation type; Na); and HiSiv (TM)-3000 (manufactured by Union
      Showa K.K., average particle diameter: 12.7 μm, cation type: Na,
      pore diameter: 6 Å or less, specific surface area (BET): 400
      m&lt;2&gt;/g or more). Each of ABSCENTS (TM)-1000, ABSCENTS
      (TM)-2000, and Smellrite (TM) contains a plurality of zeolites
      including a mordenite-form zeolite, and the ratio of the
      mordenite-form zeolite therein is 90% or more. It should be noted
      that the average particle diameter of zeolite in the present
      invention refers to a particle diameter at a cumulative volume
      percentage of 50%, which can be determined by, for example, a
      laser diffraction/diffusion method.<br>
      <br>
      [0093] With the photocatalytic material of the present invention,
      it is possible to decompose odorous components to a concentration
      lower than that achieved by a conventional composite photocatalyst
      containing an adsorbent and a photocatalyst (e.g. JP
      1(1989)-118635 A, JP 2002-136811 A, and JP 11(1999)-319570 A), so
      as to achieve deodorization, and preferably, it is possible to
      decompose acetaldehyde, which is contained much in smoke of
      tobacco products. Further, the photocatalytic material of the
      present invention is capable of recovering its ability of
      adsorbing and/or decomposing odorous components when irradiated
      with light. Therefore, with the photocatalytic material of the
      present invention, for example, a filter can be realized whose
      ability of adsorbing and/or decomposing odorous components can be
      recovered by irradiation of light for about 2 hours per one day,
      and preferably, a maintenance-free air purification device can be
      realized that does not need maintenance of a filter. Light to be
      irradiated may be any light as long as it contains light having an
      energy higher than the band gap of the titanium oxide
      photocatalyst, and it may be ultraviolet rays, preferably light
      having a wavelength of 380 nm or less, and more preferably black
      light having a center wavelength in the vicinity of 352 tun.<br>
      <br>
      [0094] The content of zeolite in the photocatalytic material of
      the present invention (zeolite/(zeolite+titanium oxide
      photocatalyst)) is, for example, 10 wt % or more; preferably 10 to
      90 wt %; more preferably 20 to 80 wt % from the viewpoint of
      enhancing the photocatalytic activity; and further preferably 20
      to 50 wt %.<br>
      <br>
      [0095] The photocatalytic material of the present invention is
      obtained by mixing the above-described titanium oxide
      photocatalyst and zeolite by, for example, dry mixing, ball-mill
      mixing, or wet mixing. Here, in order to enhance the ability of
      adsorbing odorous components, the mixing is carried out preferably
      so that the content of zeolite in the photocatalytic material is
      10 wt % or more, and more preferably 30 wt % or more. Besides, in
      order to enhance the photocatalytic activity, the mixing is
      carried out preferably so that the content of zeolite in the
      photocatalytic material is 90 wt % or less, and more preferably 40
      wt % or less.<br>
      <br>
      [0096] The average particle diameter of the photocatalytic
      material of the present invention is, for example, 5 μm or less,
      and from the viewpoint of enhancing the deodorization rate,
      preferably 1.8 μm or less, more preferably 1.5 μm or less, and
      further preferably 1 μm or less. In the present invention, the
      average particle diameter of the photocatalytic material refers to
      a particle diameter at a cumulative volume percentage of 50%,
      which can be determined by, for example, a laser
      diffraction/diffusion method.<br>
      <br>
      [0097] Next, a photocatalytic member of the present invention is
      described below. The photocatalytic member of the present
      invention includes a substrate and a photocatalyst layer formed on
      a surface of the substrate, wherein the photocatalyst layer
      contains the above-described photocatalytic material of the
      present invention. With this, for example, the performance of
      decomposing odorous components and the rate of decomposing the
      same can be enhanced, for the same reason as described above.<br>
      <br>
      [0098] The photocatalytic member of the present invention is
      obtained by applying a photocatalytic material over a substrate
      made of glass or ceramics, the photocatalytic material being
      obtained by mixing the above-described titanium oxide
      photocatalyst and zeolite. The application may be carried out in
      the following manner: a photocatalytic material is dispersed in a
      solvent such as water or ethyl alcohol, and is applied over a
      substrate; or a mixture of a photocatalytic material and an
      inorganic hinder is applied over a substrate. The use of an
      inorganic binder is preferable since it enhances adhesion of a
      photocatalytic material to a substrate. It should be noted that
      examples of the inorganic hinder include tetraethoxysilane (TEOS)
      and colloidal silica. Examples of the application method include
      slurry application, spin coating, spraying, and casting coating.<br>
      <br>
      [0099] In the photocatalytic member of the present invention, the
      content of the photocatalytic material in the photocatalyst layer
      preferably is in a range of 50 to 100 wt % in order to enhance the
      photocatalytic activity. The photocatalyst layer may contain other
      components than the above-described photocatalytic material, such
      as an inorganic binder, WO3, H2Ti4O2, TiOS, TiON, and SiO2. The
      content of these other components in the photocatalyst layer is in
      a range of, for example, 0 to 50 wt %. It should be noted that the
      thickness of the photocatalyst layer is not limited particularly,
      but it desirably is about 100 to 500 μm, through which light can
      penetrate. Further, the thickness of the substrate is not limited
      particularly, but is about 0.1 to 2 mm, for example.<br>
      <br>
      [0100] If an air permeable substrate is used as the substrate in
      the photocatalytic member of the present invention, the
      photocatalytic member of the present invention can be used as a
      gas permeable filter for the purpose of deodorization. Examples of
      the substrate having air permeability include nonwoven fabrics,
      glass fibers, foamed metals, porous ceramics, and foamed resins.<br>
      <br>
      [0101] Next, a purification device of the present invention is
      described below. The purification device of the present invention
      is a purification device that includes the above-described
      photocatalytic member of the present invention, and a light source
      that irradiates the photocatalytic member with light having a
      wavelength of 400 nm or less. With this, for example, the
      performance of decomposing odorous components and the rate of
      decomposing the same can be enhanced, for the same reason as
      described above. Preferable examples of the foregoing light source
      will be described later.<br>
      <br>
      [0102] The purification device of the present invention may be
      provided further with blowing means that introduces a gas
      containing organic substances into the photocatalytic member. This
      is because this configuration makes it possible to use the
      purification device of the present invention as an air
      purification device capable of decomposing organic substances in
      air at a high rate. It should be noted that the blowing means is
      not limited particularly, and a blower such as a sirocco fan may
      be used, for example.<br>
      <br>
      [0103] The purification device of the present invention further
      may include liquid feeding means that introduces a liquid
      containing organic substances into the photocatalytic member. This
      is because this configuration makes it possible to use the
      purification device of the present invention as a liquid
      purification device capable of decomposing organic substances in
      the liquid at a high rate. Preferable examples of the foregoing
      liquid feeding means will be described later.<br>
      <br>
      [0104] Hereinafter, embodiments of the present invention will be
      described below, with reference to the drawings. It should be
      noted that the same constituent elements are designated with the
      same reference numerals, and descriptions of the same are omitted
      in some cases.<br>

      <b>Embodiment 1</b><br>
      <br>
      [0105] FIG. 1 is a cross-sectional view of a photocatalytic member
      according to Embodiment 1 of the present invention. As shown in
      FIG. 1, the photocatalytic member 1 includes a substrate 10, and a
      photocatalyst layer 11 formed on one of principal faces of the
      substrate 10. The photocatalyst layer 11 contains the
      above-described photocatalytic material of the present invention.
      If the substrate 10 is made of a material that transmits
      ultraviolet rays, such as glass, quartz, or a fluorocarbon resin,
      a light source (not shown) can be disposed on a side of the other
      principal face so as to be isolated from a substance to be
      treated, whereby the light source can be prevented from being
      contaminated. It should be noted that the substrate 10 used in the
      present embodiment might be any material other than a material
      that transmits ultraviolet rays, as long as it is not degraded by
      ultraviolet rays. Examples of the material that is not degraded by
      ultraviolet rays include ceramics such as silica, inorganic
      materials such as metals, and organic materials such as acrylic
      resins and urethane resins. The shape of the photocatalytic member
      1 also is not limited, and the photocatalytic member 1 may be in a
      particulate form in which particles have a spherical shape, a
      polygonal shape, or different shapes in combination; in a sheet
      form of nonwoven or woven fabric; or in a porous form, a
      three-dimensional foamed form, a honeycomb form, or a pleated
      form. Further, as in Embodiment 2 described later, the
      photocatalyst layers 11 may be provided on both of the principal
      faces of the substrate 10. The photocatalytic member 1 shown in
      FIG. 1 may be used in, for example, a co-flow air purification
      device.<br>
      <br>
      [0106] Further, if the substrate having air permeability is used
      as the substrate 10 in the photocatalytic member 1, the
      photocatalytic member 1 can be used as a gas-permeable filter for
      the purpose of deodorization. Examples of the substrate having air
      permeability include nonwoven fabrics, glass fibers, foamed
      metals, porous ceramics, and foamed resins. FIGS. 2A and 2B show
      perspective views of typical gas-permeable filters of the present
      invention.<br>

      [0107] FIG. 3 is a cross-sectional view of a photocatalytic member
      according to Embodiment 2 of the present invention. As shown in
      FIG. 3, the photocatalytic member 101 includes a substrate 10, and
      photocatalyst layers 11, 11 formed on both of principal faces of
      the substrate 10. The photocatalyst layers 11 has a titanium oxide
      photocatalyst and zeolite, the titanium oxide photocatalyst
      containing at least an anatase-type titanium oxide and fluorine,
      wherein the content of the fluorine in the titanium oxide
      photocatalyst is 2.5 wt % to 3.5 wt %, and 90 wt % or more of the
      fluorine is bonded chemically with the anatase-type titanium
      oxide. With this, the photocatalytic activity is enhanced, and the
      rate of decomposition of odorous components, for example, can be
      enhanced. It should be noted that the photocatalyst layer in every
      embodiment described hereinafter has the same constitutional
      elements as those of the above-described photocatalyst layer 11.<br>
      <br>
      [0108] The substrate 10 may be made of, for example, a mesh filter
      sheet composed of warp and weft made of twisted strings of glass
      fibers. The photocatalyst layer 11 contains, for example, an
      inorganic binding agent such as silica sol, and the like, other
      than the above-described titanium oxide photocatalyst.<br>

      [0109] FIG. 4 is a perspective view of a purification device
      according to Embodiment 3 of the present invention. As shown in
      FIG. 4, a co-flow air purification device 2 includes a container
      20, a photocatalytic member 21 provided on a bottom face of the
      container 20, light sources 22 that are disposed in the container
      20 so as to face the photocatalytic member 21, and blowing means
      23 that blows odorous components in the container 20 toward the
      photocatalytic member 21. The photocatalytic member 21 includes a
      substrate 21a, and a photocatalyst layer 21b formed on the
      substrate 21a. The photocatalyst layer 21b contains the
      above-described photocatalytic material of the present invention.
      The container 20 is made of for example, a metal, a resin, or the
      like. As the light sources 22, black lights having a wavelength of
      352 nm at the maximum irradiation intensity, or cold-cathode
      tubes, can be used. The light intensity of the light sources 22
      is, for example, 1 mW/cm&lt;2 &gt;or more, and it is possible to
      increase the activity degree of the photocatalyst by increasing
      the light intensity. On the other hand, from the viewpoints of the
      uniformity of light, the power consumption, and the lifetime, the
      light intensity preferably is about 0.5 mW/cm&lt;2 &gt;to 5
      mW/cm&lt;2&gt;. It should be noted that the distance between the
      light sources 22 and the photocatalyst layer 21b may be about 1 to
      20 cm.<br>
      <br>
      [0110] The co-flow air purification device 2 may be used in the
      following manner. First, a gaseous substance is introduced toward
      the photocatalytic member 21 with the blowing means 23, so that
      the photocatalyst layer 21b adsorbs the gaseous substance. The
      light sources 22 irradiate the photocatalyst layer 21b with
      ultraviolet rays, so that the gaseous substance is decomposed
      oxidatively. Here, the irradiation of the photocatalyst layer 21b
      with ultraviolet rays may be carried out after the gaseous
      substance is adsorbed by the photocatalyst layer 21b, or the
      adsorption of the gaseous substance and the irradiation of
      ultraviolet rays may be carried out concurrently. It should be
      noted that an amount of air blown by the blowing means 23 may be
      set in a range of, for example, 0.5 to 2 m/s.<br>

      formed with, for example, a metal or a resin. The parting plate
      25a is formed with a substrate having air permeability, such as a
      punched metal plate. As a substrate 21a of the photocatalytic
      member 21, a substrate having air permeability can be used, such
      as a substrate made of a nonwoven fabric, a glass fiber, a foamed
      metal, a porous ceramics, a foamed resin, or the like. It should
      be noted that the method of using the cross-flow air purification

      according to Embodiment 5 of the present invention, and FIG. 6B is
      a cross-sectional view of the same taken along a line I-I shown in
      FIG. 6A. As shown in FIGS. 6A and 6B, the air purification device
      3 includes a container 30, a photocatalytic member 31 provided at
      a bottom of the container 30, and light sources 32 that irradiate
      the photocatalytic member 31 with light having a wavelength of 400
      nm or less. Between a ceiling face of the container 30 and the
      light sources 32, semi-cylindrical reflection plates 33 are
      provided so that light from the light sources 32 is projected
      uniformly over the photocatalytic member 31. It should be noted
      that the reflection plates 33 are made of, for example, stainless
      steel, aluminum, or the like. Further, the container 30 is made
      of, for example, a metal, a resin, or the like.<br>
      <br>
      [0113] As shown in FIG. 6B, the photocatalytic member 31 includes
      a substrate 31a made of ceramics or the like, and a photocatalyst
      layer 31b formed on a light-source-32-side principal face of the
      substrate 31a. Further, as shown in FIG. 6A, the photocatalytic
      member 31 is in a pleated form so that an area where the
      photocatalytic reaction occurs is expanded. It should be noted
      that the photocatalyst layer 31b is formed on the substrate 31a by
      spreading, slurry coating, or another means. Further, the
      photocatalyst layer 31b may contain, for example, several percents
      by weight of an inorganic binder or the like so that the adhesion
      thereof to the substrate 31a is enhanced.<br>
      <br>
      [0114] As the light sources 32, black lights having a wavelength
      of 352 nm at the maximum irradiation intensity or cold cathode
      tubes, for example, may be used. The light intensity is, for
      example, 1 mW/cm&lt;2 &gt;or more, and the activity of the
      photocatalyst can be increased by increasing the light intensity.
      However, from the viewpoints of the uniformity of light, the power
      consumption, and the lifetime, the light intensity preferably is
      about 0.5 mW/cm&lt;2 &gt;to 5 mW/cm&lt;2&gt;. It should be noted
      that the distance between the light sources 32 and the
      photocatalyst layer 31b may be about 1 to 20 cm.<br>
      <br>
      [0115] The air purification device 3 can be used in a relative
      narrow space or in an air circulation path. For example, the
      device can be used suitably in a cold air circulation path of a
      refrigerator, a dust box of a vacuum cleaner, etc. In this case,
      when the photocatalyst layer 31b of the photocatalytic member 31
      is irradiated with ultraviolet rays from the light sources 32, the
      photocatalyst layer 31b is activated. In this state, when a gas
      containing organic substances such as odors of the inside of the
      refrigerator or the vacuum cleaner, for example, is fed via an
      inlet 30a of the container 30 and comes into contact with the
      photocatalyst layer 31b, the organic substances are decomposed
      oxidatively, whereby the gas becomes a less odorous gas and goes
      out via an outlet 30b of the container 30. This is carried out
      repetitively, whereby air around the air purification device 3 is
      purified.<br>

      disposed so as to cover the opening 40a, and light sources 32 that
      are disposed at a bottom of the container 40 and irradiate the

      or less. Further, between the bottom face of the container 40 and
      the light sources 32, semi-cylindrical reflection plates 33 are
      provided so that light from the light sources 32 is projected
      uniformly over the photocatalytic member 41.<br>
      <br>
      [0117] The photocatalytic member 41 includes a substrate 41a made
      of a material that permeates ultraviolet rays (e.g. glass), and a
      photocatalyst layer 41b provided on a principal face of the
      substrate 41a on a side opposite to the light sources 32. Thus,
      the air purification device 4 of the above-described embodiment is
      configured so that the light sources 32 are surrounded by the
      container 40 and the photocatalytic member 41, whereby the light
      sources 32 are prevented from being contaminated. For example, a
      maintenance-free cooker hood can be provided if the air
      purification device 4 is disposed in an airflow path of the cooker
      hood, in which oil mist flows. In this case, the photocatalyst
      layer 41b of the photocatalytic member 41 is activated when
      irradiated with ultraviolet rays from the light sources 32. In
      this state, when oil mist 42, for example, comes into contact with
      the photocatalyst layer 41b, the oil mist 42 is decomposed
      oxidatively, whereby the surface of the photocatalytic member 41
      is returned into an original clean state.<br>

      industrial VOC (volatile organic compound) purification device for
      use in a printing plant or a paint plant. In this case, when the
      photocatalyst layer 51b of the photocatalytic member 51 is
      irradiated with ultraviolet rays from the light sources 32, the

      means 52 is driven, and a gas containing organic substances such
      as odors in the room, VOC, fungus, etc. comes in through the
      prefilter 53. When the gas comes into contact with the

      titanium oxide was 100 g/L and the concentration as to sulfuric
      acid was 250 g/L was kept at 100° C. for 3 hours to be hydrolyzed
      thermally. The pH of the obtained slurry aqueous solution was
      adjusted with ammonia water until the pH became 8.0, and was

      [0142] As to each of the titanium oxide photocatalysts of
      Reference Examples 1 to 8 and Comparative Examples 1 to 8, the
      content of fluorine and the content of sodium were determined. The
      content of fluorine was analyzed by absorptiometry (JIS K0102),
      and the content of fluorine in the photocatalyst was determined by
      percentage by weight. Further, the content of sodium was analyzed
      by inductively coupled high-frequency plasma spectrometry (ICP
      spectrometry), and the content of sodium in the photocatalyst was
      determined as ppm by weight. Further, in the preparation of each
      titanium oxide photocatalyst, a part of the re-dispersion solution
      obtained (a part of the cake in the case of Comparative Example 7)
      was dried at 50° C. under a reduced pressure so as to be powdered.
      The content of sodium in the powder was analyzed by ICP
      spectrometry, and the content of sodium in the starting material
      was determined as ppm by weight. Further, as to each of the
      titanium oxide photocatalysts of Reference Examples 1 and 2 and
      Comparative Examples 1, 2, 4, and 7, the ratio by weight of
      fluorine on surfaces of the photocatalyst with respect to titanium
      on the surfaces of the photocatalyst (hereinafter this ratio is
      referred to as “surface F ratio”) was determined by a method
      described below. The results of the same are shown in Table 1. It
      should be noted that, as shown in Table 1, the contents of sodium
      of Reference Examples 1 to 3, 6 to 8 and Comparative Examples 1
      and 5 were different even though the re-dispersion solutions
      thereof were prepared in the same way. As to the reason for this,
      it is considered that the difference was caused by variations in
      lots of titanyl sulfate as a raw material, and analytical errors.
      Further, the titanium oxide photocatalysts in Reference Examples 1
      to 8 were analyzed by a photoelectron spectroscopic analyzer, and
      every photocatalyst showed a spectrum in which a peak top of F1s
      appeared in a range of 683 eV to 686 eV.<br>

      diffractometer (working electrode: copper electrode), and a
      diffraction peak appeared at a diffraction angle 2θ=25.5°. This
      means that every titanium oxide photocatalyst obtained in

      Comparative Example was suspended in 100 ml of pure water, and
      after irradiated with ultrasonic waves for 15 minutes, it was
      centrifuged. The supernatant fluid obtained was subjected to
      colorimetric analysis using PACKTEST (registered trade name)
      manufactured by Kyoritsu Chemical Check Lab, Corp., and an amount
      of eluted fluorine ions was determined. Based on this amount of
      eluted fluorine, the amount of fluorine chemically bonded to
      titanium oxide can be determined.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0149] Method for Measurement of Surface F Ratio</b><br>
      <br>
      [0150] As to each of the titanium oxide photocatalyst powders, 1 g
      of the same was weighed, placed in a 10-mm-diameter molding die,
      and was pressed by stamping in a manner such that a load of 1
      t/cm&lt;2 &gt;was applied to each piece, so as to be formed into a
      10-mm-diameter pellet. Then, this molded pellet was broken so that
      a small fraction having a flat surface was produced, and this
      fraction was fixed on a sample stage with a double-faced tape, as
      a sample to be subjected to photoelectron spectroscopy. This
      sample was left in vacuum for one day, and thereafter
      photoelectron spectra emitted from the 2p orbital of titanium
      (Ti), the is orbital of fluorine (F), and the is orbital of carbon
      (C) were measured with a photoelectron spectroscope (ESCA-850
      model manufactured by Shimadzu Corporation, source of X-rays:
      MgKα) under the conditions of 8 kV and 30 mA. Then, with a value
      of the same emitted from the is orbital of C thus determined being
      compensated to be 284.8 eV, energies of the spectra determined by
      the measurement at the 2p orbital of Ti and the is orbital of F
      were compensated accordingly. With bonding energies of the
      spectrum being set to the corrected values, respectively, a value
      determined by the following calculation formula is assumed to be
      the surface F ratio:<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      Surface F ratio=NF×19.0/(NTi×47.9)<br>
      <br>
      [0000] where NF represents the number of atoms of F determined
      from a spectral area of the 1s orbital of F, NTi represents the
      number of atoms of Ti determined from a spectral area of the 2p
      orbital of Ti.<br>

      glass and a photocatalyst layer 21b that was formed on the
      substrate 21a so as to have a size of 12 cm×6.4 cm (thickness: 3
      μm). It should be noted that the photocatalyst layer 21b was
      formed in the following manner: 5 g of each of the powders made of
      the titanium oxide photocatalysts of Reference Examples 1 to 8 and
      Comparative Examples 1 to 8 was dispersed in ethanol so as to
      become a paste, and the paste was applied over the substrate 21a,
      and was left at room temperature for one hour so that most of
      ethanol evaporated.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0155] Evaluation Method Using Air Purification Device</b><br>
      <br>
      [0156] Before the photocatalytic member 21 was placed in the

      light sources 22 (center wavelength: 352 nm, UV lamps manufactured
      by Toshiba Lighting &amp; Technology Corporation) for 240 minutes,
      whereby organic substances adhering to the surface of the
      photocatalyst layer 21a were decomposed completely. This
      photocatalytic member 21 was then left to stand in the container
      20 (capacity: 16 L). The container 20 was filled with acetaldehyde
      so that the concentration of the acetaldehyde gas in the container
      became 500 mol ppm, and was sealed. After this was left to stand
      for 60 minutes without ultraviolet rays irradiation over the
      photocatalyst layer 21b and an adsorption equilibrium was reached,
      a change in the concentration of the acetaldehyde in the container
      20 and an amount of generated carbon dioxide were analyzed by gas
      chromatography while the photocatalyst layer 21b was irradiated
      with ultraviolet rays having an intensity of 21 mW/cm&lt;2
      &gt;using the light sources 22. The superiorities and
      inferiorities of the respective titanium oxide photocatalysts were

      [0157] Table 1 shows that all the titanium oxide photocatalysts of
      Reference Examples 1 to 8, in which the content of fluorine was
      2.5 wt % to 3.5 wt %, exhibited faster carbon dioxide generation
      rates (acetaldehyde decomposition rates) and superior
      photocatalytic activity compared to those of Comparative Examples
      1 to 8, in which the content of fluorine was out of the foregoing
      range. Besides, as shown in Table 1, the n-butylamine adsorption
      amounts of the titanium oxide photocatalysts of Reference Examples
      3 to 3, 6 to 8 and Comparative Examples 1 and 5 were different
      even though the re-dispersion solutions thereof were prepared in
      the same way. It is considered that the difference was caused by
      variations in lots of titanyl sulfate as a raw material, and
      analytical errors.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0158] Evaluation of Photocatalytic Activity 2</b><br>
      <br>
      [0159] Using the titanium oxide photocatalysts of Reference
      Examples 1 and 2 and Comparative Examples 1 and 7, photocatalytic
      members were produced, and using these photocatalytic members,
      liquid purification devices shown in FIG. 10 were assembled. Using
      each of these liquid purification devices, photocatalytic activity
      thereof was evaluated. Methylene blue, which is a pigment, was
      used as the liquid-form organic substance, and a degree of
      discoloration of methylene blue with time was measured. The
      configuration of the liquid purification device and the evaluation
      method are described below.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0160] Configuration of Liquid Purification Device</b><br>
      <br>
      [0161] FIG. 10 is a perspective view of a liquid purification
      device used in the evaluation of photocatalytic activity. As shown
      in FIG. 10, the liquid purification device 8 includes a Petri dish
      80, a photocatalytic member 71 disposed in the Petri dish 80, a
      black light 72 that was disposed so as to face the photocatalytic
      member 71, and a stand 81 for fixing the black light 72. The
      photocatalytic member 71 was produced in the same manner as the
      method of producing the photocatalytic member used in the
      above-described evaluation method using the air purification
      device.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0162] Evaluation Method Using Liquid Purification Device</b><br>
      <br>
      [0163] After a solution obtained by adding 1 mg of methylene blue
      into 200 mL of pure water was fed into the Petri dish 80, the
      photocatalyst layer 71b was irradiated with ultraviolet rays
      having an intensity of 1 mW/cm&lt;2 &gt;using the black light 72
      (center wavelength: 352 nm, UV lamp manufactured by Toshiba
      Lighting &amp; Technology Corporation), without light entering
      from the outside. Then, from the start of the irradiation until 4
      hours later, 5 mL of the foregoing solution was sampled every one
      hour. Each sample was centrifuged using a centrifuge at 3000 rpm
      for 15 minutes, and a supernatant fluid was sampled. Then, the
      supernatant fluid thus sampled was placed in a quartz cell, and an
      absorbance thereof was measured using a spectrophotometer
      (manufactured by JASCO Corporation, V-570 model). It should be
      noted that since a phenomenon in which the wavelength of absorbed
      light shifted as the decomposition of methylene blue proceeded was
      observed, the absorbance at the top point (peak position) of the
      curve was assumed to be the absorbance of the sample. Then, an
      absorbance of an aqueous methylene blue solution prepared at a
      different concentration preliminarily (standard fluid) was
      measured so that a calibration curve was produced, and a
      concentration (mg/L) of the methylene blue renal fling in the
      solution was determined based on the foregoing calibration curve
      and the absorbance of the supernatant fluid measured by the
      aforementioned method. The results are shown in FIG. 11.<br>
      <br>
      [0164] As is clear from FIG. 11, in the cases of the titanium
      oxide photocatalysts of Reference Examples 1 and 2, significantly
      higher rates of discoloration (decomposition of methylene blue)
      were observed, as compared with the cases of Comparative Examples
      1 and 7, which means that the titanium oxide photocatalysts of
      Reference Examples 1 and 2 exhibited excellent photocatalytic
      activity.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Examples 1 to 10</b><br>
      <br>
      [0165] As Examples 1 to 10, photocatalytic materials were prepared
      by physically mixing the titanium oxide photocatalyst of Reference
      Example 3 described above and zeolite for about 5 minutes using a
      mortar. Zeolite used for Examples 1 to 9 was HSZ-890HOA, ZSM-5
      form (silica/alumina ratio=1890) manufactured by Mach Corporation,
      and zeolite used for Example 10 was HSZ-690HOA, mordenite form
      (silica/alumina ratio=240) manufactured by Tosoh Corporation. It
      should be noted that the content of zeolite in each photocatalytic
      material was as shown in Table 2. As the titanium oxide
      photocatalyst of Comparative Example 9, SSP-25 manufactured by
      SAKAI Chemical Industry Co., Ltd. was prepared.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0166] Evaluation of Photocatalytic Activity 3</b><br>
      <br>
      [0167] Photocatalytic materials were produced from materials
      obtained in Examples 1 to 10, Reference Example 3, and Comparative
      Example 9, air purification devices shown in FIG. 4 were assembled
      using these, and photocatalytic activity was evaluated in the same
      manner as described above. The results are shown in Table 2. It
      should be noted that Table 2 shows ratios of carbon dioxide
      generation rates of Examples 1 to 10 and Reference Example 3 with
      respect to the carbon dioxide generation rate of Comparative
      Example 9, which is assumed to be 1.0.<br>

      [0168] As is clear from Table 2, each of the photocatalytic

      generation rate (acetaldehyde decomposition rate) as compared with
      Reference Example 3 and Comparative Example 9, i.e., superior

      10, HSZ-890HOA or HSZ-690HOA manufactured by Tosoh Corporation was
      used as zeolite, but the present invention is not limited to this
      configuration. The same effect can be achieved in the case where,
      for example, ABSCENTS (TM)-1000 manufactured by Union Showa K.K.,

      [0170] As is clear from Table 3, each Example exhibited a carbon
      dioxide generation rate (acetaldehyde decomposition rate) of more
      than 1000 mol ppm/hour, which means each Example exhibited
      superior photocatalytic activity.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 19</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0171] A punched aluminum plate whose surfaces had been anodized
      (aperture ratio: 35.4%, 20 cm×10 cm, thickness: 1 mm) was prepared
      as a substrate. The photocatalytic material of Example 3 (5 g) was
      dispersed in 10 ml of ethanol so that a paste was obtained. This
      paste-form photocatalytic material was applied over the substrate
      (18 cm×8 cm) and was left to stand at room temperature for one
      hour. Thereafter, it was dried at 80° C. for 6 hours in a drier,
      whereby a photocatalyst layer (thickness: about 70 μm) was formed.
      In the obtained photocatalyst layer, about 1 g of the
      photocatalytic material was fixed. The obtained photocatalyst
      layer was irradiated with ultraviolet rays having an intensity of
      5 mW/cm&lt;2 &gt;(center wavelength: 352 nm, black-light-blue lamp
      under the brand name of “National”) for 2 hours so that organic
      substances adhering to a surface of the photocatalyst layer were
      decomposed. Thus, a photocatalytic member in a filter form was
      produced.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 20</b><br>
      <br>
      [0172] A photocatalytic member was produced in the same manner as

      </b><br>
      [0175] Active carbon (GA crushed carbon, manufactured by Cataler
      Corporation) was dispersed in 10 ml of ethanol so that a paste was
      obtained. This paste-form photocatalytic material was applied over
      the same substrate as that in Example 19 (18 cm×8 cm) and was left
      to stand at room temperature for one hour. Thereafter, it was
      dried at 80° C. for 6 hours in a drier, whereby a filter was
      produced. The obtained filter was in such a state that granular
      active carbon was deposited on the substrate, and a thickness of
      the active carbon layer could not be determined. The active carbon
      contained in the active carbon layer was about 1 g (weight in a
      dried state).<br>

      <b>[0178] Evaluation of Filter Recycling</b><br>

      [0179] Each of the photocatalytic members of Examples 19 to 22 and
      Comparative Examples 11 and 12 and the filter of Comparative
      Example 10 were disposed on the parting plate 25a of the
      cross-flow air purification device (capacity: 100 L) shown in FIG.
      5. The device 201 was filled with acetaldehyde so that the
      concentration of acetaldehyde in the device 201 became 10 mol ppm,
      and was sealed. After this, it was left to stand for 60 minutes
      without ultraviolet rays irradiation over the photocatalyst layer
      21b. After it was checked and seen that an adsorption equilibrium
      was reached, the photocatalyst layer 21b was irradiated with
      ultraviolet rays having an intensity of 1 mW/cm&lt;2 &gt;with the
      light source 22 (center wavelength: 352 nm, black-light-blue lamp
      under the brand name of “National”) for 2 hours, whereby aldehyde
      adhering to the titanium oxide photocatalyst and zeolite was
      decomposed and removed. The concentration of acetaldehyde after
      the decomposition and removal was analyzed with a gas
      chromatograph. The device 201 again was filled with acetaldehyde
      so that the concentration of acetaldehyde became 10 mol ppm. Then,
      5 cycles of the leaving of the same to stand for 60 minutes, the
      irradiation with ultraviolet rays, the analysis, and the refilling
      were carried out. The ratio of deodorization (deodorization ratio)
      and the ratio of decrease in adsorbability (adsorbability decrease
      ratio) were calculated using the determined concentrations of
      acetaldehyde. The determined ratios of decrease in adsorbability

      Besides, it was proved that when the photocatalytic members of
