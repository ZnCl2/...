      --- Quote --- In the front of the web-page is a question… The
      answer is YES, somebody really made this kind of aircraft… First
      of all, the principle was (and is) not applied like Kirsten has
      imagined in the ‘30s but using crown-shape element which was
      endowed with several blade-shape elements ; that was a rotational
      device with a peripherical speed of 396 meters/sec ; in the center
      of this crown rotational device is nothing but the axle and
      several spokes (which connect the rotational crown with the axle)
      being the central vacuum space ; the air is absorbed from the
      center and radially evacuated through the blades. Usually, the
      rotational device is endowed with several peripherical air-guiding
      devices and a system of flow devices formed from a Coanda-effect
      flowing-wall and an external porous surface ; the Nazis were the
      first to build this kind of cyclonoidal airdraft and their
      inventor and design-engineer was Viktor Schauberger ; I am one of
      the very few people who really knows the true scheme of the
      Schauberger “repulsine”… Today, everybody can find a lot of
      schemes on the internet, but almost all of them are fake… The
      Repulsine had a cyclonoidal propeller covered by a porous
      aspiration surface, and that small flying apparatus was the
      so-called “foo-fighter” ; after WW2, in Romania, the
      German-Romanian inventor Rudolf Liciar built several
      unconventional flying apparatus for the soviets... <br>
      <br>
      I have also the original patent of Liciar,-the RO 21370 from 1932
      the original title ” Cyclonoid . Sustinator si propulsor aerian)”
      and from 1932 to 1937, Liciar has obtained another two patents,
      the original title “Helicopter” and “Aerial apparatus”, with the
      co-inventor Zareh Loremian Libaret. Rudolf Liciar was been taken
      by the soviets after 1954 and until now nobody knows the end of
      his activity and of his life...<br>

      "During 1944-1945, the Germans built several prototypes of discoid
      aircraft. These are today known as “Haunebu”. On the Internet
      there are many comments about Haunebu but basically they contain
      false information.<br>
      <br>
      I submit Your attention on a very important mechanical component
      which was used of the so-called "Heavily Armed Flight Gyro
      Haunebu". <br>
      <br>
      Haunebu aircraft is the result of hybridization of certain
      unconventional technologies. <br>
      <br>
      In particular, it was used the so-called "vacuum propulsion"
      technique. The Austrian Viktor Schauberger was the inventor.<br>
      <br>
      This information would have been perfectly classified, if not for
      the fact that in Romania (which that time had large German
      communities in the region of Transylvania) lived a German called
      RUDOLF LICIAR, who worked in the same period and also directly
      related to Schauberger's work.<br>
      <br>
      During WW2, the Germans have built and tested a small number of
      experimental devices in the eastern region of Romania. They were
      small aircrafts in the form of rotating semi-paraboloid, also
      discoidal. They remained in popular culture as “the foo-fighters”.
      Later, they built much larger aircrafts ( the so-called Haunebu)
      which used the same principle of operation. <br>
      <br>
      These aircraft were equipped with rotary crowns. Such crown were
      made up of several rotating concentric rings with different
      diameters and also different cones. <br>
      <br>
      In these devices, the air was not driven in helical trajectories,
      as happens for traditional propellers. In fact, the air ejected
      behind such (classical) propeller describes a helical trajectory.
      This causes great losses of efficiency and insignificant
      performances of propulsion.<br>
      <br>
      Both Schauberger and Liciar (who met in the mid’ 20s), found that
      the ideal propeller must drive the air in cycloid trajectories,
      not helical! So, the propeller configuration must be such as to
      ensure the air movement on cycloid trajectories. <br>
      <br>
      They obtained both, ring propellers with numerous blades, and
      these rotational rings could be assembled together to form a
      rotating device that was tipped, as a crown placed face down…<br>
      <br>
      That was the atmospheric (for take-off and landing, also for
      horizontal flight inside troposphere) propulsion device of
      foo-fighters and Haunebu,&nbsp; which have also propulsion means
      for upper atmosphere and cosmic space,- but these was based on
      electrokinetics and MHD. <br>
      <br>
      The crown propeller made by Schauberger and Liciar, was capable to
      create in its upper surface THE VACUUM ! That rotational crown,
      was positioned under the aircraft fuselage, which had a porous
      surface,- the boundary layer on the fuselage was actually vacuum,
      so the vehicle moved inside “a vacuum bell”…<br>
      <br>
      In the drawing, it is a blade that fits the ring-propeller. Such
      device contains numerous blades which have different angles of
      inclination (ranging between 45 and 75 degrees) but regardless of
      inclination, all the blades have to their extremities a 6 degree
      arc and their body is held on an arc of 20 degrees. They also have
      two clamp arms, arranged at the blades extremities, on&nbsp; their
      below surface.<br>
      <br>
      In the attachaments, also an extract from Liciar’s patent in 1933
      : “The Cyclonoid. Means of Sustentation and Propulsion”. In fact,
      this is the Haunebu and foo-fighter…<br>
      <br>
      But Liciar has also a patent unclassified: the helicopter patented
      in 1922."<br>
