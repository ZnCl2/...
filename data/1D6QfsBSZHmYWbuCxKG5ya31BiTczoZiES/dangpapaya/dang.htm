      <div align="center"><b> </b><big><b>UF researchers find
            cancer-fighting properties in papaya tea</b></big><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      GAINESVILLE, FL. — The humble papaya is gaining credibility in
      Western medicine for anticancer powers that folk cultures have
      recognized for generations.<br>
      <br>
      University of Florida researcher Dr. Nam Dang, and colleagues in
      Japan have documented papaya’s dramatic anticancer effect against
      a broad range of lab-grown tumors, including cancers of the
      cervix, breast, liver, lung and pancreas. The researchers used an
      extract made from dried papaya leaves, and the anticancer effects
      were stronger when cells received larger doses of the tea.<br>
      <br>
      In a paper published in the Feb. 17 issue of the Journal of
      Ethnopharmacology, Dang and his colleagues also documented for the
      first time that papaya leaf extract boosts the production of key
      signaling molecules called Th1-type cytokines. This regulation of
      the immune system, in addition to papaya’s direct antitumor effect
      on various cancers, suggests possible therapeutic strategies that
      use the immune system to fight cancers.<br>
      <br>
      The papaya extract did not have any toxic effects on normal cells,
      avoiding a common and devastating consequence of many cancer
      therapy regimens. The success of the papaya extract in acting on
      cancer without toxicity is consistent with reports from indigenous
      populations in Australia and his native Vietnam, said Dang, a
      professor of medicine and medical director of the UF Shands Cancer
      Center Clinical Trials Office.<br>
      <br>
      “Based on what I have seen and heard in a clinical setting, nobody
      who takes this extract experiences demonstrable toxicity; it seems
      like you could take it for a long time — as long as it is
      effective,” he said.<br>
      <br>
      Researchers exposed 10 different types of cancer cell cultures to
      four strengths of papaya leaf extract and measured the effect
      after 24 hours. Papaya slowed the growth of tumors in all the
      cultures.<br>
      <br>
      To identify the mechanism by which papaya checked the growth of
      the cultures, the team focused on a cell line for T lymphoma.
      Their results suggested that at least one of the mechanisms
      employed by the papaya extract is inducing cell death.<br>
      <br>
      In a similar analysis, the team also looked at the effect of
      papaya extract on the production of antitumor molecules known as
      cytokines. Papaya was shown to promote the production of Th1-type
      cytokines, important in the regulation of the immune system. For
      that reason, the study findings raise the possibility of future
      use of papaya extract components in immune-related conditions such
      as inflammation, autoimmune disease and some cancers.<br>
      <br>
      Bharat B. Aggarwal, a researcher at the University of Texas M.D.
      Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, already is so convinced of
      papaya’s restorative powers that he has a serving of the fruit
      every day.<br>
      <br>
      “We have always known that papaya has a lot of interesting things
      in there,” said Aggarwal, a professor in the center’s department
      of experimental therapeutics who was not involved in the UF
      research. Foremost among papaya’s health-promoting agents is
      papain, papaya’s signature enzyme, which is found in both the
      fruit and the leaves.<br>
      <br>
      “This paper has not gone too much into identifying the components
      responsible for the activity, which is just fine. I think that is
      a good beginning,” Aggarwal said.<br>
      <br>
      Aggarwal also noted that papaya extract’s success in reducing
      cancer in laboratory cell cultures must next be replicated in
      animal and human studies.<br>
      <br>
      “I hope Dr. Dang takes it further, because I think we need
      enthusiastic people like him to move it forward,” Aggarwal said.<br>
      <br>
      Dang and a colleague have applied to patent the process to distill
      the papaya extract through the University of Tokyo; the next step
      in the research is to identify the specific compounds in the
      papaya extract active against the cancer cell lines. For this
      stage, Dang has partnered with Hendrik Luesch, a fellow UF Shands
      Cancer Center member and a professor of medicinal chemistry.
      Luesch is an expert in the identification and synthesis of natural
      products for medicinal purposes, and recently discovered a coral
      reef compound that inhibits cancer cell growth in cell lines.<br>

      <div align="center"><b>Harvard Graduate Has Patent Pending on
          Papaya Leaves for Cancer </b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Dr Nam Dang is a medical oncologist with expertise in the study
      and treatment of lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).
      He is Professor and Deputy Chief of the Division of Hematology
      &amp; Oncology and also is Director of the University of Florida
      Shands Cancer Center Clinical Trials Office. Dr. Dang received his
      Phd in Immunology from Harvard.<br>
      <br>
      WE are excited about Dr Dang’s work on papaya leaves and greatly
      appreciate what he has shown in research on their effect against
      cancer(s). The Julia Ruffin Project focuses on promoting, growing,
      and researching papaya leaves. We offer papaya leaves grown from
      non-genetically modified seeds… just the natural product to
      markets. The Julia Ruffin Project is non-profit and is not
      creating additional products from the leaves (such as selling
      extracted leaf juice) so the patent-pending is not applicable to
      the young papaya leaves that we grow for market.<br>

      </b><br>
      I am in the business of papaya leaf tea research, promotion, and

      affordable anti-cancer natural product on earth.<br>
      <br>
      My journey to this conclusion began with frustration that this
      natural product could have possibly kept my mother with me longer
      in this life.<br>
      <br>
      As I learned more and more about enzyme therapy over years I could
      not understand why this was never a subject in school, or why it
      is not discussed more with doctors.<br>
      <br>
      I want to start conversations with this blog that will change
      people’s lives. But I am a realist and get that it is hard to
      change our eating habits. This is another reason that I am so

      I want the people who take the time to read this blog to become as

      <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      <b>AIM OF THE STUDY:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Various parts of Carica papaya Linn. (CP) have been traditionally
      used as ethnomedicine for a number of disorders, including cancer.
      There have been anecdotes of patients with advanced cancers
      achieving remission following consumption of tea extract made from
      CP leaves. However, the precise cellular mechanism of action of CP
      tea extracts remains unclear. The aim of the present study is to
      examine the effect of aqueous-extracted CP leaf fraction on the
      growth of various tumor cell lines and on the anti-tumor effect of
      human lymphocytes. In addition, we attempted to identify the
      functional molecular weight fraction in the CP leaf extract.<br>
      <br>
      <b>MATERIALS AND METHODS:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The effect of CP extract on the proliferative responses of tumor
      cell lines and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC),
      and cytotoxic activities of PBMC were assessed by [(3)H]-thymidine
      incorporation. Flow cytometric analysis and measurement of
      caspase-3/7 activities were performed to confirm the induction of
      apoptosis on tumor cells. Cytokine productions by PBMC were
      measured by ELISA. Gene profiling of the effect of CP extract
      treatment was performed by microarray analysis and real-time
      RT-PCR.<br>
      <b><br>
        RESULTS:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      We observed significant growth inhibitory activity of the CP
      extract on tumor cell lines. In PBMC, the production of IL-2 and
      IL-4 was reduced following the addition of CP extract, whereas
      that of IL-12p40, IL-12p70, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha was enhanced
      without growth inhibition. In addition, cytotoxicity of activated
      PBMC against K562 was enhanced by the addition of CP extract.
      Moreover, microarray analyses showed that the expression of 23
      immunomodulatory genes, classified by gene ontology analysis, was
      enhanced by the addition of CP extract. In this regard, CCL2,
      CCL7, CCL8 and SERPINB2 were representative of these upregulated
      genes, and thus may serve as index markers of the immunomodulatory
      effects of CP extract. Finally, we identified the active
      components of CP extract, which inhibits tumor cell growth and
      stimulates anti-tumor effects, to be the fraction with M.W. less
      than 1000.<br>
      CONCLUSION:<br>
      <br>
      Since Carica papaya leaf extract can mediate a Th1 type shift in
      human immune system, our results suggest that the CP leaf extract
      may potentially provide the means for the treatment and prevention
      of selected human diseases such as cancer, various allergic
      disorders, and may also serve as immunoadjuvant for vaccine
      therapy.<br>

      Fresh research has revealed that the papaya plant and its extracts
      can provide protection against cancer by slowing the growth of
      cancerous cells without causing harmful side effects. The
      discovery has been made by a University of Florida researcher in a
      joint project with the University of Tokyo.<br>
      <br>
      The research was published in Journal of Ethnopharmacology*.
      University of Florida researcher, the Vietnamese Dr. Nam Dang,
      conducted a research project with colleagues from the University
      of Tokyo and their findings indicate that extracts from the papaya
      plant affect the regulation of the immune system. In this way, the
      attack on the cancerous cells does not cause harmful side effects
      because it acts through boosting the immune system and therefore
      does not have any effect upon normal cells.<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Dang’s research studied the application of the papaya plant
      for cures in patients suffering from cancer among indigenous
      communities in Vietnam and Australia. He then developed four
      strengths of extract from the papaya leaf, which when applied
      clinically, slowed the growth of cancerous cells in ten different
      types of cancer, namely those affecting the cervix, the breast,
      the liver, the lungs and the pancreas. The effects were visible
      within 24 hours.<br>
      <br>
      While the research project concentrates on the application of the
      papaya leaf on cancerous cases in Asia, indigenous populations in
      Brazil have been using the papaya leaf for thousands of years in
      infusions to treat ailments of the liver, including hepatitis A.
      The research conducted by Dr. Dang was made using dried papaya
      leaves.<br>
      <br>
      He proved that papaya leaf extract increases the level of
      signalling molecules which help to regulate the immune system,
      attacking the cancerous cells. By boosting the Th1-type cytokines,
      the immune system responds to invaders while not producing toxic
      effects on healthy cells.<br>
      <br>
      This type of treatment, according to Dr. Dang, produces results
      which go hand in hand with reports from indigenous communities in
      Australia and Vietnam.<br>

      The components of a brew/extract of leaves or other parts of the
      papaya plant (Carica papaya) or fractionated components thereof
      are effective in the prevention or treatment of stomach cancer,
      lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, colon cancer or other solid
      cancers, or lymphoma, leukemia or other blood cancers, and are
      very safe with few side effects, making their medical significance
      extremely high. In addition, food compositions comprising a papaya
      plant (Carica papaya) extract component as an effective ingredient
      for the prevention or amelioration of cancer are highly expected
      to become functional foods contributing to the preservation and
      promotion of human health.<br>
      <br>
      <b>TECHNICAL FIELD</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0001] The present invention relates to compositions or food
      compositions for cancer prevention, treatment, or improvement.
      More specifically, it relates to compositions or food compositions
      that comprise, as an active ingredient, components extracted by
      brewing leaves or other parts of the papaya plant (Carica papaya),
      and that are effective in the prevention, treatment, or
      improvement of stomach cancer, lung cancer, pancreatic cancer,
      colon cancer, uterine cancer, ovarian cancer or other solid
      cancers, or lymphoma, leukemia or other blood cancers.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND ART</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0002] Conventional cancer treatment has been widely done using
      chemotherapy employing chemotherapeutic agents including
      cyclophosphamide, busulfan and other alkylating agents;
      methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil and other agents that inhibit nucleic
      acid synthesis; and actinomycin D, daunomycin and other
      antibiotics. However, many of these chemotherapeutic agents are
      toxic not only to cancer cells but also to normal cells, and their
      side effects are viewed as problematic. Compared to these
      chemotherapeutic agents, immunotherapy using immune activators
      that treat cancer by activating the macrophages and T cells of the
      immune system has attracted attention as a treatment method having
      fewer side effects. However, therapeutic agents that are effective
      in the treatment of cancer and yet have few side effects and a
      high level of safety have not yet been developed.<br>
      <br>
      <b>DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0003] Accordingly, the objective of the present invention is to
      provide compositions or food compositions for cancer prevention,
      treatment, or improvement that are highly effective in the
      treatment and prevention of cancer, and yet have few side effects
      and a high level of safety.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] As a result of exhaustive research regarding the
      aforementioned objective, the present inventors discovered that
      components of papaya, preferably one or more extracted papaya
      components obtained by brewing papaya, have superior effects in
      the treatment of cancer, and that accordingly, they can become
      compositions or food compositions for cancer prevention,
      treatment, or improvement with few side effects and a high level
      of safety, thus completing the present invention. Accordingly, the
      present invention relates to compositions or food compositions for
      cancer prevention, treatment, or improvement that comprise as
      active ingredients one or more components of the papaya plant
      (Carica papaya), and preferably one or more components extracted
      by brewing a part of a papaya plant.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] A more detailed explanation of the present invention is
      provided below.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] The present invention uses components of the papaya plant
      (Carica papaya), preferably components extracted by brewing a part
      of a papaya plant tissue, as active ingredients. The tissue of the
      papaya plant may be any of its leaves, roots, stems or fruit, but
      the leaves are particularly preferable. Preferably, this papaya
      tissue is dried, and the dried material thus obtained is added to
      cold water or boiling water, brewed for a long time, and the brew
      thus obtained is used as an active ingredient. Alternatively,
      without drying the papaya leaves (or some other tissue), the
      leaves may be added to cold water or boiling water and brewed.
      More specifically, papaya leaves, for example, may be left in the
      sun, normally for one or two days, and dried to obtain the dried
      material. One to several of these dried leaves are added to cold
      water or boiling water (normally 400 ml to 3000 ml), and
      preferably 500 ml to 1000 ml, and brewed for normally two hours to
      15 hours, and preferably three hours to 12 hours. The vessel used
      for brewing is preferably not a metal vessel, but rather a glass,
      wooden, plastic or other vessel.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] A component thus obtained, particularly a component
      extracted by brewing papaya, comprises the effect of suppressing
      the proliferation of cancer cells, and can be used as it is as an
      active ingredient of the composition or food composition according
      to the present invention. Furthermore, the composition can also be
      provided as a botanical drug. According to the present invention,
      this brew may be further subjected to a refining process. The
      components that comprise the effect of suppressing the
      proliferation of cancer cells can be fractionated, and the
      fractionated components thus obtained may be used as an active
      ingredient. Such fractionated components are, for example,
      preferably obtained from an extract of papaya leaves that, when
      subjected to gel filtration chromatography using a gel filtration
      column filled with cross-linked polyvinyl alcohol gel, the gel
      filtration column having an exclusion limit molecular weight of
      40,000 when pullulan is used as a sample, is eluted in a portion
      of the eluate equivalent to 50-70 vol. % of the volume of the
      column. As an example of such gel filtration chromatography, the
      column used for gel filtration chromatography may be a column that
      is a stainless-steel tube with an inside diameter of 7.6 mm*length
      of 500 mm, filled with cross-linked polyvinyl alcohol gel with a
      grain diameter of 9 [mu]m, and having an exclusion limit molecular
      weight of 40,000 when pullulan is used as a sample (Shodex
      Asahipak GS-310 7G) (Showa Denko K. K.). A neutral buffer
      solution, for example a phosphate buffer solution, may be used as
      the eluate. A specific example is obtained by dissolving 9.6 g of
      powdered Dulbecco's PBS (-) "Nissui" (Nihon Pharmaceutical Co.,
      Ltd.) in 1 L of deionized water and autoclaving for 15 minutes at
      121[deg.] C. to obtain a sterilized buffer solution (pH 7.3 to
      7.65).<br>
      <br>
      [0008] Under these conditions, when the extract is subjected to
      gel filtration chromatography, it is possible to obtain those
      components comprising the effect of suppressing the proliferation
      of cancer cells by collecting fractionated components obtained by
      eluting a portion of the eluate equivalent to 50-70 vol. % of the
      volume of the column. As recited in the subsequent Examples, these
      fractionated components were put through a gel filtration column
      similar to that described above, the chromatogram was measured
      with a differential refractometer (RI) and ultraviolet
      spectrophotometer (SPD-10AVp), and the approximate calculation of
      the molecular weight and evaluation of the physical properties of
      the included components was performed based on a comparison of the
      molecular weights relative to pullulan and oligosaccharide markers
      with known molecular weights. Components with molecular weights of
      1700, 1000, 700, 600, 400, and 300 were detected by an RI
      detector. Peaks were detected for molecules (groups) at molecular
      weights of 1700 and 1000 under UV (260 nm), and were also found at
      low molecular weights (300 to 700), also under UV (260 nm).
      Accordingly, the fractionated components comprising anti-tumor
      effects further refined from the extract of papaya leaves are
      contained within molecules (groups) with molecular weights of
      1700, 1000 and 700 to 300 that absorb UV (260 nm), and the
      molecule (groups) with molecular weights of 1700, 1000, 700, 600,
      400, 300 and 200 that are detectable by RI, each of which are
      thought to act independently or in combination to achieve the
      anti-tumor effect.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] The brews/extracts thus obtained or further fractionated
      components may be ingested as they arein order to prevent, treat,
      or ameliorate cancer. The brews/extracts or fractionated
      components may also be mixed with appropriate ingredients
      ordinarily used in drinks and taken as a drink. Alternatively, the
      brews/extracts or fractionated components may be dried if
      necessary, and then taken in a powder or tablet or other form
      after the addition of excipients or other additives ordinarily
      used in powders, tablets or the like.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] In addition, when being stored, the papaya components of
      brews/extracts, or fractionated components thereof, are preferably
      stored not in a metal vessel, but rather in a glass, wooden,
      plastic or other vessel under low-temperature conditions, for
      example around 4[deg.] C.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] The present invention's brew/extract components, prepared
      from, for example, a papaya leaf, or fractionated components
      thereof, are effective in the prevention or treatment of stomach
      cancer, lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, liver cancer, colon
      cancer, uterine cancer, ovarian cancer, neuroblastoma or other
      solid cancers, or lymphoma, leukemia or other blood cancers. In a
      preferred embodiment, treatment is administered to those suffering
      from a disease. In another embodiment, treatment is administered
      as prophylaxis. The dose of the brew/extract components or
      fractionated components thereof to be administered will depend on
      the dosage form, symptoms of the subject, type of cancer or the
      like. However, for example, when the brew/extract is taken, it is
      normally preferable to take an amount of 100 ml to 750 ml per day,
      every day for between one month and three months. When the
      fractionated components are taken, it is preferable to take an
      amount of 10 ml to 200 ml per day, every day for between one month
      and three months.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] Also, the present invention provides food compositions that
      comprise a papaya (Carica papaya) brew/extract as an effective
      ingredient for preventing or treating cancer. In addition to
      general foods, a food composition of the present invention may
      include, for example, a health food, a functional food, a
      specified health food, a nutrient supplement, an enteral nutrient,
      and the like, but is not limited to these foods so long as it is
      effective in preventing or ameliorating cancer. Methods for
      manufacturing the food compositions are usual techniques known to
      those skilled in the art. That is, a papaya (Carica papaya)
      brew/extract component according to the present invention can be
      combined with an additive acceptable in view of food sanitation,
      and processed to make a general food, a health food, a functional
      food, a specified health food, a nutrient supplement, an enteral
      nutrient, etc. For example, an additive such as a stabilizer,
      preservative, colorant, perfume, vitamin can be appropriately
      added to a papaya (Carica papaya) brew/extract component, mixed,
      and processed by standard methods into a form suitable for a food
      composition, such as a tablet, pill, granule, powder, capsule,
      liquid, cream, drink, etc. Furthermore, the food compositions of
      the present invention include those sold with a description or
      indication written on the food composition's packaging container
      and/or in a promotional pamphlet, to the effect that the food
      composition, and/or an ingredient in the food composition,
      comprises the effect of preventing, or ameliorating cancer.<br>

      <b>BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0025] Herein below, the present invention will be specifically
      described using Examples, however, it is not to be construed as
      being limited thereto.<br>
      <br>
      <b>WORKING EXAMPLE 1</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      <b>Preparation of an Extract From Papaya Leaves</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0026] Papaya leaves were left in the air for approximately one to
      two days under the sun and thus dried, and approximately 27 g,
      that is, about one dried papaya leaf, was added to 500 ml of water
      in a glass vessel, brewed for twelve hours, until the total
      quantity was 50 ml. The brew thus obtained was filter-sterilized
      to obtain the papaya extract according to the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXPERIMENTAL EXAMPLE 1</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      <b>Test of the Anti-Cancer Effects of Papaya Leaf Extract by the
        MMT Assay Method</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0027] Various types of cancer cells were used to examine the
      anti-cancer effects of the papaya leaf extract, prepared according
      to Working Example 1, by means of the MMT assay method (Hansen et
      al., J. Immunol. Methods 119:203-210, 1989). (1) Method<br>
      <br>
      [0028] Cancer cells from the AGS (stomach cancer cell line),
      Capan-1 (pancreatic cancer cell line), DLD-1 (colon cancer cell
      line), Dov-13 (ovarian cancer cell line), Karpas (lymphoma cell
      line), MCF-7 (breast cancer cell line) and T98G (neuroblastoma
      cell line) were dispensed into a 96-well microtiter plate and
      cultured in a RPMI-1640 solution medium containing 10% fetal calf
      serum, and cultured until confluent. Next, the papaya leaf extract
      prepared according to Working Example 1 was diluted with culture
      medium by 20 times (1:20), 150 times (1:150) and 400 times (1:400)
      respectively, and a volume of 100 [mu]l of the dilute solution was
      added to the cancer cell lines in each well, which were cultured
      at 37[deg.] C. for two to eight days. Thereafter, 25 [mu]l of
      3-(4,5-dimethylthiazole-2-yl)2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide
      (MTT) was added to each well to make the final concentration 1
      mg/ml, and they were cultured at 37[deg.] C. for an additional two
      hours, and then 100 [mu]l of isopropanol containing 0.04 N
      hydrochloric acid was added. After culturing overnight at 37[deg.]
      C., the absorbance at 570 nm was measured and compared against
      that of the control to examine just how many of the cells were
      killed by the papaya leaf extract. (2) Results<br>
      <br>
      [0029] The results thus obtained are shown in FIG. 1 through FIG.
      7. As is evident from these figures, the papaya leaf extract had a
      concentration-dependent anti-cancer effect on each of the cancer
      cell lines. In particular, as shown in FIG. 5, the maximum value
      of cell death of 40% appeared on the fourth day of culture in
      Karpas (lymphoma cell line) at a 50 times dilution of the
      concentration of the extract.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXPERIMENTAL EXAMPLE 2</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      <b>Test of the Anti-Cancer Effects of Papaya Leaf Extract by
        &lt;3&gt; H-Thymidine Incorporation (1) Method</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0030] Cancer cells from the Hela (uterine cancer cell line),
      Karpas (lymphoma cell line), CD26 negative Jurkat (T cell leukemia
      cell line) and CD26 positive Jurkat (CD26 transfectant T cell
      leukemia cell line) were dispensed at 5*10&lt;3&gt; /100 [mu]l
      into a 96-well microtiter plate. Next, the papaya leaf extract
      prepared according to Working Example 1 was diluted with culture
      medium (RPMI-1640 solution containing 10% fetal calf serum) to
      various dilution ratios, and 10 [mu]l of each was added to the
      cancer cell lines in each well, which were cultured at 37[deg.] C.
      in a 5% CO2 incubator. After 24 and 48 hours of culturing,
      &lt;3&gt; H-thymidine was added in the amount of 1 [mu]Ci (1
      microcurie)/10 [mu]l. After four hours, the amount of &lt;3&gt;
      H-thymidine (cpm) incorporated into the cancer cells for the
      purpose of DNA synthesis was measured with a scintillation counter
      to examine the effect of suppressing the proliferation of cancer
      cells. (2) Results<br>
      <br>
      [0031] The results thus obtained are shown in FIG. 8 through FIG.
      11. As is evident from these figures, the papaya leaf extract
      suppressed the incorporation of &lt;3&gt; H-thymidine by various
      cancer cell lines, and thus suppressed DNA synthesis. This clearly
      exhibited a suppressive effect on proliferation.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXPERIMENTAL EXAMPLE 3</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      <b>Application to Patients</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0032] A 47-year-old female patient had stomach cancer that had
      metastasized to the pancreas. Her tumor marker value CEA was 49
      and alpha fetoprotein was 369. One dried papaya leaf was placed in
      3000 ml of water and boiled in a wooden vessel for approximately
      three hours until concentrated to 750 ml. The patient drank
      approximately 750 ml of the papaya leaf extract every day for 90
      days, then took a break from drinking for 90 days, and then
      continued to drink for 90 days. As a result, the pancreatic
      metastasis of the stomach cancer disappeared, the CEA level
      dropped to 2.3, and the alpha fetoprotein also dropped to 2.0,
      with no relapse found thereafter.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] In addition, long-term survival from drinking papaya leaf
      extract was seen in five lung cancer patients, three stomach
      cancer patients, three breast cancer patients, one pancreatic
      cancer patient, one liver cancer patient, and one blood cancer
      patient.<br>
      <br>
      <b>WORKING EXAMPLE 2</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Fractionation of Papaya Leaf Extract, Measurement of the
      Anti-Tumor Effects of Fractionated Components, and Analysis of
      Fractionated Components (1) Fractionation by Gel Filtration
      Chromatography<br>
      <br>
      [0034] Dried papaya leaf (approximately 27 g) was heated for one
      hour to 100[deg.] C. in 500 ml of distilled water using a glass
      beaker, and then further heated for ten hours at 55[deg.] C. to
      prepare an extract concentrated to a volume of 50 ml. Thereafter,
      fractionation by molecular weight was performed by gel filtration
      chromatography, and further analysis of the anti-tumor active
      substances was performed.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] Gel filtration chromatography was performed at room
      temperature using 500 [mu]l of extract. Fluid transport was
      performed using an LC-10AVp (Shimadzu Corp.), where the
      moving-phase flow rate was 1 ml/min, and the fractionation method
      involved manually collecting the eluate from the detector outlet
      at one-minute intervals, thereby obtaining a total of 60
      fractions. Note that the column used for gel filtration
      chromatography was a column that is a stainless-steel tube with an
      inside diameter of 7.6 mm*length of 500 mm, filled with
      cross-linked polyvinyl alcohol gel (grain diameter of 9 [mu]m),
      and having a molecular weight exclusion limit of 40,000 when
      pullulan is used as a sample (Shodex Asahipak GS-310 7G) (Showa
      Denko K. K.). Moreover, the eluate used was obtained by dissolving
      9.6 g of powdered Dulbecco's PBS (-) "Nissui" (Nikon
      Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.) in 1 L of deionized water, and
      autoclaving for 15 minutes at 121[deg.] C. to obtain a sterilized
      buffer solution (pH 7.3 to 7.65). (2) Measurement of the
      Anti-Tumor Effects of Fractionated Components<br>
      <br>
      [0036] In order to study the anti-tumor effects of the
      fractionated components, Jurkat T cells were suspended in
      RPMI-1640 medium (Sigma) (10% fetal bovine serum), and
      disseminated over a 96-well cell culture microplate (flat bottom)
      (Becton, Dickinson &amp; Co.) at a concentration of 5*10&lt;3 &gt;
      cells/well (5*10&lt;4 &gt; cells/ml). Moreover, the fractionated
      components obtained by gel filtration chromatography were added to
      each well in the amount of 10 [mu]l per 100 [mu]l of medium, and
      culturing was performed. After 48 hours from the commencement of
      culturing, both the Jurkat T cells in the group with fractionated
      components added, and the group with no additions, were labeled
      with &lt;3&gt; H-thymidine (&lt;3&gt; H-TdR) (PerkinElmer Life
      Sciences) to 1 [mu]Ci/well and cultured for four hours.
      Thereafter, the amount of &lt;3&gt; H-TdR incorporated into the
      cells was measured, and the amount of DNA synthesized by each of
      the Jurkat T cells was evaluated, thereby examining the anti-tumor
      effect of each fractionated component. FIG. 12 illustrates the
      effects of the addition of fractionated components of papaya leaf
      infusion on the proliferation of Jurkat T cells. (3) Results<br>
      <br>
      [0037] From the results illustrated in FIG. 12, the Jurkat T cells
      cultured in medium, and Jurkat T cells to which a quantity of PBS
      equal to the fractionated components was added, exhibited
      &lt;3&gt; H-TdR incorporation of 15192.33+-413.4 (cpm) and
      16837.33+-288 (cpm) respectively. On the other hand, Jurkat T
      cells added with the fractionated components eluted between 12
      minutes and 13 minutes of gel filtration chromatography elution
      time (fraction 13: the portion of eluate equivalent to 53 to 57
      vol. % of the column volume), and the fractionated components
      eluted between 13 minutes and 14 minutes of gel filtration
      chromatography elution time (fraction 14: the portion of eluate
      equivalent to 57 to 62 vol. % of the column volume), exhibited
      &lt;3&gt; H-TdR incorporation of 2757+-153.7 (cpm) and 3080+-84.7
      (cpm) respectively. This is comparable to the &lt;3&gt; H-TdR
      incorporation of 3316.7+-516.0 (cpm) by Jurkat T cells to which
      unfractionated (pre-gel filtration chromatography) extract,
      100-fold diluted with culture medium, was added.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] Accordingly, the present inventors found that the
      fractionated components of the papaya leaf extract that comprise
      the effect of suppressing the proliferation of Jurkat T cells
      (anti-tumor effect) are present in fractions 13 and 14. (4)

      <br>
      [0039] Furthermore, the fractionated components obtained by gel
      filtration chromatography that comprise anti-tumor effects
      (fraction 13 and fraction 14) were each placed in a similar
      column, and the chromatogram was measured with a differential
      refractometer (RI) (RID-6A) (Shimadzu Corp.) and ultraviolet
      spectrophotometer (SPD-10AVp) (Shimadzu Corp.). Approximate
      calculation of the molecular weight and evaluation of the physical
      properties of the included components was performed based on a
      comparison of the molecular weights relative to pullulan and
      oligosaccharide markers with known molecular weights.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] As a result, in fraction 13, components with molecular
      weights of 1700, 1000, 700 and 300 were detected by an RI
      detector, and peaks were also detected for molecules (groups) at
      molecular weights of 1700 and 1000 under UV (260 nm). Thus this
      fraction is presumed to contain compounds with absorption in these
      regions. On the other hand, in fraction 14, components with
      molecular weights of 1700, 1000, 600, 400 and 200 were detected by
      the RI detector, and peaks were found for molecules (groups) at
      molecular weights of 1700 and 1000 and also at low molecular
      weights (300 to 700) under UV (260 nm).<br>
      <br>
      [0041] Accordingly, the fractionated components comprising
      anti-tumor effects extracted from papaya leaves were extracted
      between 12 minutes and 14 minutes after the start of the gel
      filtration chromatography used in this experimental system. The
      components comprising anti-tumor effects are contained within the
      molecules (groups) with molecular weights of 1700, 1000 and 700 to
      300 that absorb UV (260 nm), and the molecules (groups) with
      molecular weights of 1700, 1000, 700, 600, 400, 300 and 200 that
      are detectable by RI, each of which are considered to act
      independently or in combination to achieve anti-tumor effect.<br>
      <br>
      <b>INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY</b><br>
      <br>
      [0042] As described above in detail, the components of an
      brew/extract of leaves or other parts of the papaya plant (Carica
      papaya) or fractionated components thereof, for example, are
      effective in the prevention or treatment of stomach cancer, lung
      cancer, pancreatic cancer, colon cancer or other solid cancers, or
      lymphoma, leukemia or other blood cancers, and are very safe with
      few side effects, making their medical significance extremely
      high. In addition, food compositions comprising a papaya plant
      (Carica papaya) extract component as an effective ingredient for
      the prevention or amelioration of cancer are highly expected to
      become functional foods contributing to the preservation and
      promotion of human health.<br>

      <b>DESCRIPTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0001] Prevention of cancer, including water-soluble components
      extracted Shirohanahebi tongue grass and papaya, the present
      invention relates to compositions for the treatment or
      amelioration.<br>
      In particular, it contains a component extracted by decoction in
      hot water leaves Shirohanahebi tongue grass and papaya, while
      maintaining the immunostimulatory effects of the components of the
      two, to exert a synergistic effect in anti-tumor activity of
      cancer A composition for the amelioration, or treatment, to
      compositions and pharmaceutical can be used for food.<br>
      <br>
      [0002] Of course the case of malignant tumors, until you get the
      assurance of remission after surgery in particular, chemotherapy
      is essential when surgery itself is difficult to carry out, or
      when resection of the tumor is impossible only surgery.<br>
      <br>
      However, at present it to enhance the tumor specificity in
      chemotherapy is difficult, side effects on normal cells of the
      self is to always associated.<br>
      <br>
      You can easily imagine that be faced with side effects in physical
      fitness in deep discharge is a major damage to the body and mind,
      but even would be an agent with the privation suffering how,
      people and the surrounding sufferers to face in every difficulty
      and pain, of connecting the desire to get better it is natural.<br>
      <br>
      On the other hand, information on alternative therapies variety
      are flooding the society.<br>
      <br>
      What you poor credibility, which imposes economic burden, are
      situations in which, such as those intake ongoing difficult there
      are also many, I can not help but want to believe even information
      unrealistic parable in it there also is a fact.<br>
      <br>
      However, it is aims at the treatment of diseases of the mechanisms
      which can not be solved with the so-called modern medicine and
      alternative therapies original on heuristic scientific
      considerations is not always present, to recognize the
      significance difficult, it can not become the hope for recovery.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] The extracts from plants transmitted from ancient times, it
      be effective is present in certain diseases is empirically known.<br>
      <br>
      (Hedyotis Diffusa, Japanese name: Futabamugura)
      Shirohanahebishitakusa with a long history as a herbal medicine,
      is a plant that grows wild in our country also in an annual plant
      of the Rubiaceae, information as a folk medicine drugs is
      relatively large.<br>
      <br>
      (4 and Non-Patent Documents 1, 2, 3) which by oral administration
      to mice, anti-tumor effect, anti-viral effect, IgE production
      inhibition, and anti-parasitic effect has been reported.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, as a herbal medicine that exerts an anti-tumor
      effect, Hanedahasu (Ren contrary, mint family, Scutellaria
      Barbatae) are known, the anti-tumor effect in the case of a
      combination of the Hanedahasu and Shirohanahebi Shitakusa also
      consider (6 and Non-Patent Document 5) are.<br>
      <br>
      On the other hand, papaya (Carica Papaya), is distributed in
      tropical throughout now beginning Vitamin C with antioxidant,
      tannins, vitamin A, E, K, saponins, and iron contained in the
      leaves, digestion aid , anti-inflammatory effects, and
      antiparasitic effects have been reported (Non-Patent Document 7).<br>
      <br>
      Further, the extract components leaf papaya, to have anti-tumor
      effects have been reported (Patent Document 1).<br>

      [0004] The extract of the plant-derived handed down from ancient
      times, that the effective ones are present in certain diseases are
      known to experience, but the scientific evidence is poor, I
      unknown also the mechanism of the effect part in many cases.<br>
      <br>
      Plant-derived extracts a long period of time, humans have been
      ingested, should you go beyond only wisdom empirical simply, it
      holds the promise significant potential towards drug development
      in the future.<br>
      Further, as long as the resulting extract Shirohanahebishitakusa,
      Hanedahasu, Great papaya exhibits an effective medicinal, because
      these plants are edible originally therapeutics highly safe less
      side effects This is what can be expected as.<br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, an object of the present invention, as an active
      ingredient an extract from plants, prevention of cancer, is to
      provide a composition having high safety has fewer side effects or
      improvement effect on treatment and high.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] When Shirohanahebi tongue grass with a long history as a
      herbal medicine and focused on water-soluble components extracted
      papaya tropical American origin, for these extracts were subjected
      to immunological analysis, the present inventors have found that
      two possibility that the cytotoxic activity, immunostimulating
      effect is a significant increase in water-soluble components of
      the papaya extract in a water-soluble component extraction White
      Flower snake tongue grass mainly when compared with between Sha
      has been shown.<br>
      <br>
      Further, as a result of examination did on the details of this
      possibility, with the expectation that there is an effect
      synergistic or complementary by mixing both, it was analyzed, the
      mixing of the two, maintains immunostimulatory effect while, that
      the cytotoxic synergistic activity against tumor cell lines are
      derived was confirmed.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention has been completed based on these findings.<br>
      <br>
      Therefore, as an active ingredient a water-soluble component
      extraction Shirohanahebishitakusa and water-soluble extract
      components of papaya (Carica papaya) of (Hedyotis Diffusa),
      prevention of cancer, the present invention is a composition for
      the treatment or amelioration some.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Immunostimulatory activity is maintained, against the tumor
      cell line, composition comprising, as an active ingredient, both
      water-soluble components extracted Shirohanahebi tongue grass and
      water-soluble extract components of papaya exert cytotoxic
      activity synergistic.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, the compositions of the present invention are useful
      pharmaceuticals highly safe with fewer side effects of cancer
      prevention, improvement or treatment is high and, as a health food
      and the like.<br>
      <br>
      Further, the water-soluble extract obtained by boiling, in which
      easily is generally accepted as the "infusion" so to speak,
      relatively, it can be taken easily, regardless of the extent of
      the condition.<br>
      <br>
      The usefulness high regard to the nature that must be taken
      continuously, it is excellent in convenience and economical
      efficiency, and safety.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] The present invention will be described in detail below.<br>
      <br>
      By way of active ingredient in the present invention, the use of
      both water-soluble components extracted Shirohanahebi tongue grass
      and water soluble extractives papaya.<br>
      <br>
      Is used to obtain the extract, as the structure of the tongue
      Shirohanahebi grass and papaya, one leaf, root, stem, fruit may be
      any, but the leaves are particularly preferred.<br>
      <br>
      In addition to hot water or a dried product dried tissue
      Shirohanahebi tongue grass papaya and these can be obtained, is
      used as an active ingredient, a liquid infusion which is boiled
      for a long time, are obtained.<br>
      <br>
      It is also possible to obtain a liquid infusion without drying the
      tissue, such as leaves and grass Shirohanahebi tongue papaya, and
      boiled in addition to water or hot water as it is.<br>
      <br>
      Specifically, for example, to obtain a dried product can be left
      to dry for 2 days from one day normal daylight, leaves
      Shirohanahebi tongue grass papaya and more.<br>
      <br>
      1000ml usually 50ml, in addition to hot water or 500ml of 100ml, 5
      hours 30 minutes usually, and preferably, to cook with boiling for
      1 to 2 hours, preferably, an amount of 100g about 5g of the dried
      leaves&nbsp; is preferred.<br>
      <br>
      The container used when cooking, a glass container is not a
      container made of metal, wood, and plastic is preferred.<br>
      <br>
      After boiling is preferably maintained at a temperature of about
      70 ? from 60 ?, it is to concentrate to 250ml about 50ml.<br>
      <br>
      Then, preferably by filtration, after removal of the leaves,
      further kept at a temperature of 70 ? about 60 ?, it's
      concentrated 125ml about 25ml.<br>
      <br>
      Then, the water-soluble extract which was centrifuged at a high
      speed centrifuge, and the supernatants collected and passed
      through sequentially sterile filtration filters of different pore
      size, adjusted to 63ml about 13ml final concentration, and the
      desired It can be obtained preferably component.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] It is possible to obtain a composition of the present
      invention by mixing thus obtained, both of the water-soluble
      components extracted Shirohanahebi tongue grass and water soluble
      extractives papaya.<br>
      4:1, preferably from 1:4 volume ratio, and further, 4:1,
      preferably from 2:1 mixing ratio of the water-soluble component
      extraction White Flower snake tongue grass and water-soluble
      extract components of papaya, 3 especially : 4:1, preferably from
      1.<br>
      <br>
      It should be noted that the volume ratio, based on the
      water-soluble extract components extracted under the same
      conditions using an equivalent amount of water from the leaves of
      equivalent each, a water-soluble extractives of Shirohanahebi
      tongue grass and water-soluble extract components of papaya is a
      volume obtained when.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] It is possible by taking as a mixture of both water-soluble
      components extracted Shirohanahebi tongue grass and water soluble
      extractives papaya, prevention of cancer, use as a medicament for
      treating or improving.<br>
      <br>
      Can also be taken as a health drink by mixing with a suitable
      component commonly used for beverage agent for the mixture.<br>
      <br>
      Alternatively, it is possible, after drying if necessary, the
      mixture is taken in the form of powders, such as tablets by a
      conventional method, in addition to excipients such as commonly
      used powders, tablets, or the like.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] A mixture of both water-soluble components extracted
      Shirohanahebi tongue grass and water-soluble extract components of
      papaya can also be used for health food, functional food, food for
      specified health use, dietary supplements, and enteral nutrition.<br>
      <br>
      To a mixture of both water-soluble components extracted
      Shirohanahebi tongue grass and water soluble extractives papaya,
      formulations are typically used, for example, by the addition of
      stabilizers, preservatives, colorants, flavors, vitamins and the
      like, It is possible by conventional methods, can be processed to

      <br>
      <b>[0015] (2) Analysis of cytokine production</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Production is decreased in a concentration-dependent manner from
      the point of 800-fold, was inhibited 70% or more at 200-fold IL-2,
      IL-4 (Figure 2).<br>
      From the fact that decreased production of cell these growth
      factors was observed, the phenomenon of cell death has not got up
      yet, but against mediated activation (TCR) complex CD3 / T cell
      receptor in PBMC, and the very early stage may have been derived
      from the suppression stage was considered.<br>
      Enhancement of production is the most recognized at the point of
      800 times with extracts of either, was reduced in a
      concentration-dependent manner and then IL-12p40 (Figure 3).<br>
      IL-12p70 is also similar, C. P.<br>
      H. than D.<br>
      More of addition, high inducibility slightly.<br>
      A similar trend was observed IFN-?, TNF-a, also IL-10 (FIG. 4).<br>
      Thus, is some material from the extract, the possibility that

      <b>Test Example 2</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Measurement of proliferative capacity and culture of human tumor
      cell lines<br>
      <br>
      As solid tumor line, Lu99 (large cell lung cancer), A549, PC14
      (lung adenocarcinoma) HepG2, Huh-7 (liver cancer), MCF-7 (breast
      cancer), Hela (cervical cancer), H2452, JMN, MESO 4 (lung
      mesothelioma), I was using the (pancreatic cancer) CaPan1, Panc1.<br>
      Were cultured in (Sigma) DMEM or RPMI1640, including the FCS 10%
      cell lines, respectively.<br>
      Were plated in 96well flat bottom plates at 1X104/Well each tumor
      cell line was attached to the bottom surface sufficiently For
      adherent cells.<br>
      Then, add the extracts were diluted 400-fold 50-fold, were
      cultured for 24 hours.<br>
      18 hours until the end of the culture, measurement of
      proliferative capacity is [3H] - and then the radioactivity was
      measured by conduct labeling with thymidine.<br>
      [0017]<br>
      <br>
      <b>Result</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      It was considered that thymidine incorporation is low, significant
      results were not obtained, this analysis method is not suitable -
      [3H] For A549, Lu99.<br>
      On the other hand, both cell growth inhibition at high
      concentrations (50-fold) (cervical cancer, breast cancer, lung
      adenocarcinoma, lung mesothelioma, liver cancer, pancreatic
      cancer) with respect to the other cell lines with high uptake
      Shown, of course, H. up to the concentration of 400 times D.<br>

      Showed growth suppression is added alone like a mixed addition.<br>
      When the point of the 400-fold high dilution most, we compared the
      additive mixture in the ratio of several single and added, by
      mixing, cervical cancer (FIG. 6A), breast (Fig. 6B), liver cancer
      (Figure 6C anti-tumor effect was observed synergistically lung
      adenocarcinoma (Figure 6D), lung mesothelioma (Fig. 6E),
      pancreatic cancer (Fig. 6F),).<br>
      A similar trend was observed for the other cell lines that Panc-1
      with respect to pancreatic cancer, but low uptake itself of
      [3H]-Thymidine when compared with other cell lines to mention the
      presence or absence of a synergistic effect was determined (Figure
      5), it is not appropriate.<br>
      Synergistic effect due to the mixing, H. D. : C. P.<br>
      It was found highest when it is used in a ratio of 1:3-1:4 ratio.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0018] For immunostimulatory activity of the extract</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Point of 400-fold diluted from 800-fold was observed with enhanced
      cell function and inhibition of growth factor-activated PBMC is
      believed to have a density slightly less than threshold
      cytotoxicity is expressed.<br>
      Will there is a possibility that it exceeds the concentration,
      resulting in damage directly to the cell, perhaps.<br>
      However, for oral ingestion is the basic, because it is present in
      the blood at high concentrations physiologically is impossible,
      there is a consistent result is obtained here, these extracts
      those very interesting is.<br>
      It is a cytokine produced from antigen presenting cells (APC)
      mainly, p40, a subunit of IL-12p70 is, (Brombacher F, Kastelein
      that the production is enhanced dramatically by activation of APC
      is known RA, Alber G. Novel il-12 family members shed light on the
      orchestration of th1 responses.<br>
      Trends Immunol 2003; 24 (4): 207-12).<br>
      On the other hand, be produced from a wide range of lymphocytes
      has been reported that p35 is (Watford WT, Moriguchi M, Morinobu
      A, O'Shea JJ The biology of il-12:. Coordinating innate and
      adaptive immune responses.<br>
      Cytokine Growth Factor Rev 2003; 14 (5): that stimulation through
      CD40-40L is essential in order to function as p70 361-8), subunits
      between these forms dimers CD40L-deficient mice (Cella M,
      Scheidegger D, Palmer-Lehmann K, Lane P, Lanzavecchia A, Alber G.
      Ligation of cd40 on dendritic cells triggers production of high
      levels of interleukin-12 and enhances t cell stimulatory capacity
      has been reported by: Tt help via apc activation.<br>
      J Exp Med 1996; 184 (2): 747-52).<br>
      However, the extract-derived components in the state of "raw", so
      to speak, various substances of natural origin are included, could
      be recognized by the innate immune response as a mere "foreign
      matter" is difficult discarded.<br>
      Results were placed directly stimulate APC as a "foreign
      material", increasing the production of p40 can be considered
      thoroughly, and sufficient consideration to such dilution or
      purification method, in order to eliminate that possibility.<br>
      As a result, may result in the increased p70 production and p40
      production correlated is obtained, are involved in modification of
      the adaptive immune response of the T-B cell-cell or T-APC, as
      well as activation of APC I was shown here.<br>
      In addition, inflammatory cytokines IFN-? or TNF-a is also an
      important factor to continue to modify the immune response that
      follows.<br>
      In particular, I hope to anti-tumor effect to have of these
      cytokines.<br>
      Further, from the viewpoint of TNF-a and IFN-? is induced in
      correlation with the IL-12p70, involvement of substance having Th1
      induction activity was also unpredictable.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0019] For anti-tumor effect of the extract</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The growth inhibition was observed in solid tumor cell lines,
      there was no suitable analysis method, but the induction of cell
      death was determined to be contributed by microscopy.<br>
      The possibility when using these cell lines due to the synergistic
      mixture is observed, as shown in FIG 8, is enhanced by any factor
      inducing cytotoxicity is mixing was considered.<br>
      In the case of adherent cells, in order to avoid that the extract
      inhibits the direct adherence to culture plate bottom surface, can
      be added after it is adhered completely was essential.<br>
      Adhesion inhibitory effect by itself also extract, cells -
      contribution as contribute to the anti-tumor effect of suppressing
      the growth and metastasis of tumors to suppress the adhesion to
      the extracellular matrix between, expected in the in vivo - cell
      or cell-to-cell, likely to be thought about.<br>
