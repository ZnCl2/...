      <br>
      Dr. Gerald Pollack, University of Washington professor of
      bioengineering, has developed a theory of water that has been
      called revolutionary. He has spent the past decade convincing
      worldwide audiences that water is not actually a liquid.<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Pollack received his PhD in biomedical engineering from the
      University of Pennsylvania in 1968. He then joined the University
      of Washington faculty and is now professor of bioengineering. For
      years, Dr. Pollack had researched muscles and how they contract.
      It struck him as odd that the most common ideas about muscle
      contraction did not involve water, despite the fact muscle tissue
      consists of 99 percent water molecules.<br>
      <br>
      Water Research happens at Pollack Laboratories, which states, "Our
      orientation is rather fundamental -- we are oriented toward
      uncovering some of nature's most deeply held secrets, although
      applications interest us as well."<br>
      <br>
      Uncovering nature's secrets involving water is what Dr. Pollack,
      his staff and students do best.<br>
      <br>
      In his 2001 book, "Cells, Gels and the Engines of Life," Dr.
      Pollack explains how the cell functions. Research suggests
      that&nbsp; much of the cell biology may be governed by a single
      unifying mechanism - the phase transition. Water is absolutely
      central to every function of the cell - whether it's muscle
      contraction, cells dividing, or nerves conducting, etc.<br>
      <br>
      This extraordinary book challenges many of the concepts that have
      been accepted in contemporary cell biology. The underlying premise
      of this book is that a cell's cytoplasm is gel-like rather than an
      ordinary aqueous solution.<br>
      <br>
      The key to Dr. Pollack's entire hypothesis lies in the properties
      of water. The water molecules become structured in arrays or
      strata when they interact with charged surfaces such as those
      presented by proteins. The cell's water is potentially structured.
      Water stays put in the cells because it's absorbed into the
      protein surfaces. Structured water adheres to the proteins of the
      cells.<br>
      <br>
      Structured water does not have the same properties as bulk water.
      Water is the carrier of the most important molecules of life, like
      proteins and DNA. In the book, "Cells, Gels and the Engines of
      Life," evidence is presented that shows water is absolutely
      essential to everything the cell does. The water in our cells is
      not like water in a glass. It's actually ordered pretty much like
      a crystal. Like ice, it excludes particles and solutes as it
      forms. The space formed is called an exclusion zone (EZ). <br>
      <br>
      Evidence that exclusion zone water/structured water is physically
      different from bulk water (H2O) :<br>
      <br>

      <br>
      <div align="center"> <i>Structured water forms an exclusion zone
          that excludes particles and solutes.</i><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Dr. Pollack discovered a new phase of water. Bulk Water is H2O but
      this new phase of water, the exclusion zone structured water, is
      H3O2. It's a newly discovered phase of water. If you count the
      number of hydrogen's and oxygen's, you find out it's not H2O. <br>
      <br>
      Structured water is hexagonal crystalline structure between liquid
      water and crystal.<br>
      <br>
      <div align="center"><i>Hexagonal structured crystal sheet </i><br>

      </div>
      <br>
      Structured Water forms (honeycomb) hexagonal sheets very similar
      to ice because it's the next phase! Structured Water (liquid
      crystalline) is H3O2 . . . the fourth phase of water. It's a
      transition stage between water and ice. <br>
      <br>
      <b>The Fourth Phase of Water / EZ Water / Structured Water</b><br>
      <br>
      The reason this fourth phase of water is called the exclusion zone
      or EZ is because the first thing Dr. Pollack's team discovered is
      that it profoundly excludes things. Even small molecules are
      excluded from structured water. Surprisingly, structured water
      appears in great abundance, including inside most of your cells.
      Even your extracellular tissues are filled with this kind of
      water.<br>
      <br>
      Where can we get structured water?<br>
      <br>
      Spring water -- under pressure (deep in the ground) becomes
      structured.<br>
      <br>
      Glacial melt -- ice turns into Structured Water (EZ water) when
      melting . . . The phase between liquid and solid is structured
      water.<br>
      <br>
      Vortexing -- A vortex occurs naturally in nature, as in streams,
      rivers, waterfalls, etc. The vortex is a kind of mechanical
      perturbation or agitation. Vortexing is a very powerful way of
      increasing structure. There are devices on the market which vortex
      water. One such device is the Natural Action Structured Water
      Unit.<br>
      <br>
      Juicing -- is water that comes from the plant cells. Structured
      juice water!<br>
      <br>
      Antioxidents -- Most of the tissues in our body are negative. Our
      cells are a negative charge; oxidants are a positive charge.
      Antioxidents maintain the negative charge in our body.<br>
      <br>
      Sunlight -- critical to our health. Light builds Structured Water
      (EZ water.) <br>
      <br>
      Circulation -- Red blood cells work their way through capillaries;
      light is the driver of flow. Add light and flow increases.
      Something other than the heart (pressure) is driving the blood.<br>
      <br>
      Infared light -- energy is generated everywhere. It drives the
      processes in your body. <br>
      <br>
      The fourth phase of water: starts with the basics of what we know
      about water . . . from simple experiments we figure out this
      fourth phase of water. What's the nature of this fourth phase? Why
      is this interesting? It applies to everything water touches. It's
      in the sky and the clouds. It's in the oceans, lakes and rivers,
      and it fills the inside of our body.<br>

      <br>
      Water is clearly one of the most important factors for your
      health—especially when you consider that your body actually
      consists of over 99 percent water molecules! I sincerely believe
      water is a really underappreciated part of the equation of optimal
      health.<br>
      <br>
      I’ve previously interviewed Dr. Gerald Pollack, who is one of the
      leading premier research scientists in the world when it comes to
      understanding the physics of water, and what it means to your
      health.<br>
      <br>
      Besides being a professor of bioengineering at the University of
      Washington, he’s also the founder and editor-in-chief of a
      scientific journal called Water, and has published many
      peer-reviewed scientific papers on this topic. He’s even received
      prestigious awards from the National Institutes of Health.<br>
      <br>
      His book, The Fourth Phase of Water: Beyond Solid, Liquid, and
      Vapor, is a phenomenal read that is easy to understand even for
      the non-professional.<br>
      <br>
      It clearly explains the theory of the fourth phase of water, which
      is nothing short of ground-breaking. The fourth phase of water is,
      in a nutshell, living water. It’s referred to as EZ water—EZ
      standing for “exclusion zone”—which has a negative charge. This
      water can hold energy, much like a battery, and can deliver energy
      too.<br>
      <br>
      For years, Dr. Pollack had researched muscles and how they
      contract, and it struck him as odd that the most common ideas
      about muscle contraction do not involve water, despite the fact
      that muscle tissue consists of 99 percent water molecules.<br>
      <br>
      How could it be that 99 percent of the molecules were ignored? How
      could it be that muscle contracts without involving the water in
      some way? These questions help catalyze his passionate
      investigation into water.<br>
      <br>
      <b>So You Think You Understand Water?</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      Gilbert Ling, who was a pioneer in this field, discovered that
      water in human cells is not ordinary water (H2O), but something
      far more structured and organized.<br>
      <br>
      “I began to think about water in the context of biology: if water
      inside the cell was ordered and structured and not bulk water or
      ordinary water as most biochemists and cell biologists think, then
      it is really important,” Dr. Pollack says.<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Pollack’s book also touches on some of the most basic features
      of water, many of which are really not understood. For example,
      how does evaporation take place? Why does a tea kettle whistle?
      Also, despite the fact that conventional science tells us freezing
      is supposed to occur at zero degrees Celsius, experiments show
      that it can freeze in many different temperatures down to minus 50
      degrees Celsius.<br>
      <br>
      There’s actually no one single freezing point for water! Other
      experiments show that the boiling point of 100 degrees Celsius (or
      212 degrees Fahrenheit) does not always hold true either.<br>
      <br>
      “There’s a famous website1 put together by a British scientist,
      Martin Chaplin. Martin lists numerous anomalies associated with
      water,” Dr. Pollack says. “In other words, things that shouldn’t
      be according to what we know about water...<br>
      <br>
      The more anomalies we have, the more we begin to think that maybe
      there’s something fundamental about water that we really don’t
      know. That’s the core of what I’m trying to do. In our laboratory
      at the University of Washington, we’ve done many experiments over
      the last decade. These experiments have clearly shown the
      existence of this additional phase of water.”<br>
      <br>
      The reason this fourth phase of water is called the exclusion zone
      or EZ is because the first thing Dr. Pollack’s team discovered is
      that it profoundly excludes things. Even small molecules are
      excluded from EZ water. Surprisingly, EZ water appears in great
      abundance, including inside most of your cells. Even your
      extracellular tissues are filled with this kind of water.<br>
      <br>
      <b>The Water in Your Cells Give Them Their Negative Charge</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      Other inherent differences between regular water and EZ water
      include its structure. Typical tap water is H2O but this fourth
      phase is not H2O; it’s actually H3O2. It’s also more viscous, more
      ordered, and more alkaline than regular water, and its optical
      properties are different. The refractive index of EZ water is
      about 10 percent higher than ordinary water. Its density is also
      about 10 percent higher, and it has a negative charge (negative
      electrical potential). This may provide the answer as to why human
      cells are negatively charged. Dr. Pollack explains:<br>
      <br>
      “Everybody knows that the cell is negatively charged. If you
      insert an electrode into any of your cells, you’ll measure a
      negative electrical potential. The textbook says that the reason
      for this negative electrical potential has something to do with
      the membrane and the ion channels in the membrane.<br>
      <br>
      Oddly, if you look at a gel that has no membrane, you record much
      the same potential – 100 millivolts or 150 millivolts negative.
      The interior of the cell is much like a gel. It’s kind of
      surprising that something without a membrane yields the same
      electrical potential as the cell with a membrane.<br>
      <br>
      That raises the question: where does this negativity come from?
      Well, I think the negativity comes from the water, because the EZ
      water inside the cell has a negative charge. The same is true of
      the gel—the EZ water in the gel confers negativity. I think the
      cells are negatively charged because the water inside the cell is
      mainly EZ water and not neutral H2O.”<br>
      <br>
      <b>What Creates or Builds EZ Water?</b><br>
      <br>
      One of the greatest surprises is that the key ingredient to create
      EZ water is light, i.e. electromagnetic energy, whether in the
      form of visible light, ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths and infrared
      wavelengths, which we’re surrounded by all the time. Infrared is
      the most powerful, particularly at wavelengths of approximately
      three micrometers, which is all around you. The EZ water can build
      on any hydrophilic or water-loving surface when infrared energy is
      available.<br>
      <br>
      It builds by adding layer upon layer of EZ water, and can build
      millions of molecular layers. This is how it occurs in nature. For
      example, ice doesn’t form directly from ordinary H2O. It goes from
      regular water to EZ water to ice. And when you melt it, it goes
      from ice to EZ water to regular water. So EZ water is an
      intermediate state.<br>
      <br>
      “Glacial melt is a perfect way to get EZ water. And a lot of
      people have known that this water is really good for your health,”
      Dr. Pollack says.<br>
      <br>
      Testing water samples using a UV-visible spectrometer, which
      measures light absorption at different wavelengths, Dr. Pollack
      has discovered that in the UV region of 270 nanometers, just shy
      of the visible range, the EZ actually absorbs light. The more of
      the 270 nanometer light the water absorbs, the more EZ water the
      sample contains. EZ water appears to be quite stable. This means
      it can hold the structure, even if you leave it sitting around for
      some time. Water samples from the river Ganges and from the
      Lourdes in France have been measured, showing spikes in the 270
      nanometer region, suggesting these “holy waters” contain high
      amounts of EZ water. According to Dr. Pollack, there’s compelling
      evidence that EZ water is indeed lifesaving...<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b> EZ Cellular Water Helps Explain Health Benefits of Light
        and Heat Therapies</b><br>
      <br>
      Heating equates to applying infrared energy, and Dr. Pollack has
      found that if you apply infrared, the EZ water builds and doesn’t
      diminish. The implications of this are profound when you consider
      the health benefits of sitting in an infrared sauna, for example.
      Essentially, one of the reasons why infrared saunas make you feel
      so good is because your body’s cells are deeply penetrated by
      infrared energy, which builds and stores EZ water. The same goes
      for light therapy, spending time in the sun, and laser therapy.<br>
      <br>
      “There are various kinds of light therapy using different
      wavelengths. We found that all wavelengths – some in particular –
      of light, even weak light, build EZ. If EZ is critical for the
      health of your cells, which I think is clear, these therapies have
      a distinct physical chemical basis,” Dr. Pollack explains.<br>
      <br>
      EZ water also provides a mechanism that explains other biological
      mysteries. For example, Dr. Pollack describes another fascinating
      finding that further bolsters our understanding of the mechanism
      of action behind the health benefits of something as simple as
      exposing your body to the light and heat of the sun:<br>
      <br>
      “We found that if we put a simple tube, like a straw, made of
      hydrophilic material, in water... there’s water flow through the
      tube at high speed. This happens spontaneously. But it shouldn’t
      happen spontaneously. The common idea is that if you want to drive
      fluid through a pipe or tube, you need to apply pressure. But we
      have no pressure here. There’s no pressure difference between the
      input and output. But flow builds up spontaneously, and it keeps
      going.<br>
      <br>
      Recently, we found that if we add light, the flow goes faster. It
      means that light has a particular effect; especially ultraviolet
      light, but other wavelengths as well. It speeds up the flow. We
      think that somehow the exclusion zones (EZs) are involved because
      inside those tubes, there’s a little annular ring of exclusion
      zone, and inside that is an area full of protons... It seems that
      the exclusion zone and the pressure of these protons are driving
      the flow.”<br>
      <br>
      Now, let’s apply these mechanisms to your body. Your capillaries
      receive radiant energy from outside all the time. Energy is also
      received from the inside of your body, as metabolic reactions
      continuously generate heat or infrared. So the question is, is it
      possible that the flow of blood occurring through your capillaries
      is automatically enhanced by exposure to light? It appears the
      answer may be yes...<br>
      <br>
      “This is an important issue because the capillaries are puzzling,”
      Dr. Pollack says. “They’re so small. Some of the capillaries are
      smaller in diameter than the red blood cells that pass through
      them. Any competent engineer would never build a pipe that’s
      smaller than the junk that’s supposed to go through. But nature,
      apparently, has done that...<br>
      <br>
      Now, that means there’s a lot of resistance. You need something to
      push those red blood cells through... One possibility is that the
      flow in your capillaries is aided by this kind of radiant
      energy... We’re starting to test this... It’s possible that your
      cardiovascular system is assisted by radiant energy in the same
      way that the flow in the tubes is assisted by radiant energy.”<br>
      <br>
      One of the more interesting healing modalities I’ve been exploring
      lately is the use of a high-powered laser. The K-Laser also has
      frequencies in the infrared range, which can deeply penetrate
      tissue. This kind of laser therapy has shown to provide profound
      healing for many painful injuries in a very short amount of
      time—sometimes just minutes of treatment. While the benefits of
      laser therapy are thought to be due to its action on mitochondrial
      activity, it may very well be that the benefits are also related
      to “recharging” your damaged cells’ EZ water, as well as promoting
      increased capillary blood flow.<br>
      <br>
      EZ water in your body also plays a role is in hyperbaric medicine,
      which is also good for injuries. In that case, your tissues are
      exposed to high oxygen under pressure.<br>
      <br>
      “The results are in. We think we understand the mechanism as to
      why hyperbaric oxygen is so effective for wound healing... EZ
      water has a higher density than bulk water. If you take H2O and
      you put it under pressure, it should give you H3O2 because the EZ
      structure is denser than the H2O. We did the experiments and we
      found, indeed, that’s the case. If you put H2O under pressure, you
      get more EZ water.”<br>
      <br>
      The same goes for oxygen. EZ also has more oxygen than H2O, and
      when you increase oxygen content, you get more EZ water. So,
      hyperbaric treatment builds EZ water in your body, particularly in
      injured areas where EZ water is needed.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Alkalinity and Your Body’s Negative Charge May Be Critical for
        Health</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      I personally drink vortexed water nearly exclusively as I became a
      big fan of Viktor Schauberger who did much pioneering work on
      vortexing about a century ago. Dr. Pollack found that by creating
      a vortex in a glass of water, you’re putting more energy into it,
      thereby increasing EZ. According to Dr. Pollack, virtually ANY
      energy put into the water seems to create or build EZ water.<br>
      <br>
      “We have looked at acoustic energy that seems to effect some
      change in the water. We’re still not sure exactly what. Vortexed
      water puts enormous energy into the water. There are several
      groups in Europe studying this phenomenon right now. “<br>
      <br>
      As mentioned earlier, EZ water is alkaline and carries a negative
      charge. Maintaining this state of alkalinity and negative charge
      appears to be important for optimal health. Drinking water can be
      optimized in a variety of different ways, by injecting light
      energy or physical energy into the water by vortexing, for
      example. This is fairly easy using magnets. Reversing the vortex
      every few seconds may even create more energy.<br>
      <br>
      Clearly, more research needs to be done in this area, but some is
      already underway. My own R&amp;D team is working on a careful
      study in which we use vortexed water to grow sprouts, to evaluate
      the vitality and effectiveness of the water. <br>
      <br>
      As for a natural source of EZ water for drinking, an ideal source
      is glacial melt. Unfortunately, this is extremely inaccessible for
      most people. Another good source is water from deep sources, such
      as deep spring water. The deeper the better, as EZ water is
      created under pressure. Natural spring water is another excellent
      way to obtain this type of water and you can use
      FindaSpring.com&nbsp; to help you find one close to you.<br>
      <br>
      Besides optimizing the water you drink, you can help generate an
      electron surplus, or support this negative charge within your
      body, simply by connecting to the Earth, which also has a negative
      charge. This is the basis of the earthing or grounding technique,
      which has been shown to have significant health benefits by
      allowing the transfer of negatively charged electrons from the
      ground into the soles of your feet. In a sense, it’s as though
      your cells are built like batteries that are naturally recharged
      by spending time outdoors — whether sunny or overcast, and walking
      barefoot, connecting to the negative charge of the earth!<br>
      <br>
      “If you have an organ that’s not functioning wel l— for example,
      it’s lacking that negative charge — then the negative charge from
      the earth and... [drinking] EZ water can help restore that
      negativity. I’ve become convinced... that this negative charge is
      critical for healthy function,” Dr. Pollack says<br>

      <b><br>
      </b><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0003] Satisfying the world's energy needs is a demanding
      endeavor. Presently, fossil fuels are responsible for supplying
      the bulk of these worldwide needs. However, fossil fuel supplies
      are finite, their consumption often has adverse environmental
      effects, their cost widely variable and somewhat unpredictable,
      and independence from them is long considered to be politically
      advantageous.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Alternative energy sources are being actively sought and
      developed. Solar and wind energy are attractive alternatives to
      fossil fuels. Wind farms have been developed and energy from them
      complements conventional energy supply. The promise of efficient
      and cost effective solar energy has yet to be realized, although
      considered to be a future solution to the worldwide energy
      problem.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Solar radiation, at its maximum produces about 1000 Watts/m
      &lt;2&gt;. Solar cells can operate up to 30% efficiency, but
      typical values of efficiency for the most economical units are
      about 15-20%. Hence, typical output is about 200 Watts/m
      &lt;2&gt;, or about 20,000 µW/cm &lt;2 &gt;at full solar
      radiation. Under more typical lighting conditions, the output
      would be an order of magnitude lower, about 2,000 µW/cm &lt;2&gt;.
      Typical photovoltaic output value is about 12,000 µW/cm &lt;2
      &gt;at full sun at the equator during the vernal equinox at
      midday, which is the absolute peak. More typical values, but still
      under bright conditions, would be an order of magnitude lower,
      perhaps 1,200 µW/cm &lt;2&gt;. The benchmark for commercial
      photovoltaic cells in fairly bright light is from about 1,000 to
      about 2,000 µW/cm &lt;2&gt;.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Despite the advances made in harnessing energy from the
      sun, a need exists to develop solar energy systems that provide
      electrical energy in an efficient and cost effective manner. The
      present invention seeks to fulfill this need and to provide
      further related advantages.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0007] The present invention provides a method and system for
      generating electrical energy from a volume of water.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] In one aspect, the invention provides a method for
      generating electrical energy from a volume of water. In one
      embodiment, the method includes contacting a volume of water with
      a hydrophilic surface and applying energy to the volume of water
      to provide an exclusion zone in the volume of water at the
      interface of the hydrophilic surface and the water, and a bulk
      zone in the volume of water outside of the exclusion zone;
      providing a first electrode in the exclusion zone and a second
      electrode in the bulk zone; and extracting electrical energy from
      the volume of water by connecting a load across the electrodes.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] The applied energy can be radiant energy from the sun or
      infrared radiant energy from a local environment.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] The method for providing electrical energy from a volume of
      water includes comprising connecting a load across first and
      second electrodes in contact with a volume of charge-separated
      water, wherein the volume of water is in contact with a
      hydrophilic surface in liquid communication with the water
      defining an exclusion zone at an interface of the hydrophilic
      surface and the water, and a bulk zone in the volume of water
      outside of the exclusion zone, wherein the first electrode is in
      the exclusion zone, and wherein the second electrode is in the
      bulk zone.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] In another aspect of the invention, a system for generating
      electrical energy from a volume of water is provided. The system
      includes a hydrophilic material having a hydrophilic surface; a
      vessel for receiving the hydrophilic material and a volume of
      water; a first electrode positioned in the vessel proximate to the
      hydrophilic surface; and a second electrode positioned in the
      vessel distal to the hydrophilic surface.<br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0032] The present invention provides a method and system for
      generating electrical energy from a volume of water. In the
      method, electrical energy is extracted from the volume of water
      that is subject to or has been subject to applied energy, such a
      radiant energy from the sun or the local environment.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] In one aspect, the invention provides a method for
      generating electrical energy from a volume of water. In one
      embodiment of the method, a volume of water is contacted with a
      hydrophilic surface and subjected to the application of energy to
      provide an exclusion zone at the interface of the hydrophilic
      surface and the water. A bulk zone in the volume of water is
      formed outside of the exclusion zone. Charge separation is induced
      in the volume of water by applying energy to the volume of water.
      Electrical energy is extracted from the volume of water by
      providing a first electrode in the exclusion zone and a second
      electrode in the bulk zone, and connecting a load across the
      electrodes.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] As used herein, the term “exclusion zone” refers to a
      region of the volume of water created at the interface of the
      hydrophilic surface and the water where solutes and particles are
      excluded. The term “bulk zone” refers to the region of the volume
      of water outside the exclusion zone. The exclusion zone results
      from the application of energy (e.g., radiant energy) to the
      volume of water. The exclusion zone builds with increasing applied
      energy.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] Application of energy to the volume of water in contact
      with the hydrophilic surface results in the formation of the
      exclusion zone. In the process, charge separation is induced in
      the volume of water. As used herein, the term “charge separation”
      refers to the physical separation of negative charges (e.g.,
      solutes, particles, ions) from positive charges (e.g., solutes,
      particles, ions) in the volume of water. In general, the exclusion
      zone is a region of negative charge and the bulk zone is a region
      of positive charge (e.g., hydronium ions, free protons).<br>
      <br>
      [0036] The size and shape of the exclusion zone formed in the
      method of the invention varies greatly depending on the nature of
      the hydrophilic surface, its size and shape, the nature of the
      volume of water, and the energy applied. The size of the exclusion
      zone is variable and dependent on the applied energy: the greater
      the applied energy, the greater the size of the exclusion zone.
      The exclusion zone can extend up to a meter or more from the
      hydrophilic surface. The exclusion zone can therefore extend from
      the hydrophilic surface any distance from about 1 nm to a meter or
      more. In certain embodiments, the exclusion zone can extend a
      distance of from one to two millimeters from the hydrophilic
      surface. In other embodiments, the exclusion zone can extend a
      distance of from about 200 µm to about 700 µm from the hydrophilic
      surface. The shape of the exclusion zone is also variable. For
      example, when the hydrophilic surface is a sheet positioned
      against a wall of the vessel containing the volume of water, the
      exclusion zone extends into the volume of water away from the
      surface of the hydrophilic surface. When a sheet of material
      having two hydrophilic surfaces is placed in a volume of water,
      the exclusion zone extends into the volume of water away from each
      surface. For a sphere of hydrophilic material having a hydrophilic
      surface, the exclusion zone extends radially into the volume of
      water away from the sphere (e.g., shell). In other embodiments,
      the exclusion zone extends into the volume of water non-uniformly.
      For examples, the exclusion zone can have the form of a cone
      narrowing into the volume of water. Exclusion zones having a
      plurality of cones extending into the volume of water have also
      been observed. Schematic illustration of the volume of water
      having exclusion and bulk zones is shown in FIG. 1.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] Exclusion zones were not observed with materials having
      hydrophobic surfaces, such as silicon rubber, nylon, carbon,
      quartz, and a plastic paraffin film (PARAFILM®, is a registered
      trademark of Bemis Co. INC. OF Neenah, Wis.), hereinafter referred
      to as “PARAFILM”. In general, the materials having surfaces that
      are highly charged (e.g., sulfonated tetrafluoroethylene copolymer
      (NAFION 117 polymer), polyacrylic acid gels) exhibit the largest
      exclusion zones, while those that are least charged (e.g.,
      polyvinyl alcohol gels) exhibit the smallest exclusion zones.
      (NAFION®, hereinafter referred to as “NAFION” is a registered
      trademark of E.I. Du Pont De Nemours and Company Corporation of
      Wilmington, Del.) In all cases, the region beyond the exclusion
      zone had net positive charge, confirmed by measurements of pH,
      which showed low pH and therefore high hydrogen ion concentration.
      In some experiments the pH was as much as four units lower than
      the original water pH. However, the situation is reversed in the
      case of positively charged surfaces. These included positively
      functionalized polystyrene gel beads, and SELEMION® positively
      functionalized ion exchange resin (SELEMION®, hereinafter referred
      to as “SELEMION” is a registered trademark of AGC Engineering Co.,
      LTD. of Chiba, Japan). In such cases the potential was 100-200 mV
      positive at the surface, declining to zero at the edge of the
      exclusion zone. The bulk water beyond had high pH instead of low
      pH. In these cases of positively charged surfaces, the exclusion
      zones were found to be smaller and somewhat more ephemeral than
      those next to the negatively charged surfaces.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] The volume of water required for the method of the
      invention is not critical. The method is applicable to nanoscale
      volumes of water and to expansive volumes of water (e.g., lakes
      and oceans). The pH of the volume of water can vary (e.g., from
      about 2 to about 11). It has been observed that relatively more
      electrical energy can be obtained by the method at low pH (e.g.,
      pH&gt;about 4). The volume of water can include solutes such as
      salts. Suitable salts include potassium chloride and sodium
      chloride. Other salts, such as those used in chemical batteries
      can also be used. The ionic strength of the volume of water can
      also vary. Ionic strengths up to about 5M have provided reasonable
      output. Electrical energy has been extracted from volumes of water
      having ionic strength up to about 5M, and optimal energy has been
      obtained at ionic strengths from about 100 mM to about 2M.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] In the method, the exclusion zone is formed adjacent to the
      hydrophilic surface. As used herein, the term “hydrophilic
      surface” refers to a surface of a material having a contact angle
      less than 90 degrees for water. The hydrophilic surfaces may be
      charged or uncharged. The charged hydrophilic surfaces may be
      mixed charge surfaces. The charged hydrophilic surfaces may have a
      net positive charge or a net negative charge.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] Suitable materials having hydrophilic surfaces include
      hydrophilic gels (e.g., polyacrylic acid gels, polyvinyl alcohol
      gels, polyacrylamide gels, polyHEMA gels, collagen gels, actin
      gels, and agarose gels), biological materials (e.g., muscle
      tissue, vascular endothelium, xylem, oxtail tendon, seaweed, and
      plant root), self-assembled monolayers including carboxyl
      group-containing monolayers and polyethylene glycol-containing
      monolayers (e.g., supported on metal surfaces such as gold),
      polymeric surfaces (e.g., ionomer surfaces) including sulfonic
      acid-containing polymer surfaces (e.g., sulfonated
      tetrafluoroethylene copolymer surface also known as NAFION),
      inorganic surfaces (e.g., surfaces containing titanium dioxide,
      silicon, zinc, lead, tungsten, aluminum, tin, and mica), and ion
      exchange resins and materials.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] As noted above, suitable materials having hydrophilic
      surfaces may have a variety of shapes. In one embodiment, the
      hydrophilic material is a sheet having a rectangular hydrophilic
      surface. In another embodiment, the hydrophilic material is a
      particle (e.g., microsphere or nanosphere). In other embodiments,
      the hydrophilic material includes a plurality of hydrophilic beads
      (e.g., mixed charged beads, negatively charged beads, positively
      charged beads).<br>
      <br>
      [0042] In one embodiment, the hydrophilic material is ice.
      Exclusions zones have been observed for each of the hydrophilic
      materials noted above.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] As noted above, in the method, a volume of water is
      contacted with a hydrophilic surface and subjected to the
      application of energy. Application of energy increases the size of
      the exclusion zone. In one embodiment, applying energy includes
      irradiating the volume of water with electromagnetic radiation.
      Suitable electromagnetic radiation includes radiation absorbed by
      the volume of water (e.g., wavelengths in the range from about 200
      nm to about 10,000 nm). In the method, infrared wavelengths are
      the most effective wavelengths. In one embodiment, the radiant
      energy has a wavelength of about 3 µm.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] The applied energy can be radiant energy from the
      environment such as solar energy (e.g., ultraviolet, visible, near
      infrared, and infrared radiation) and heat from the local
      environment (infrared radiation).<br>
      <br>
      [0045] Although radiant energy is the source of energy applied to
      the volume of water, in one embodiment of the method, the size of
      the exclusion zone can be increased by applying a voltage across
      the electrodes.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] In the method, electrical energy is extracted from the
      charge-separated volume of water by connecting a load across the
      first and second electrodes. The nature of the electrodes is not
      particularly critical. Suitable electrodes include platinum, zinc,
      aluminum, stainless steel, and copper electrodes. The first and
      second electrodes may the same or different.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] The load can be connected after a predetermined period of
      time after inducing charge separation (i.e., after applying energy
      to the volume of water). Alternatively, the load can be connected
      during application of energy (e.g., applying radiant energy to the
      volume of water) in which case electrical energy is extracted from
      the volume of water at the same time that energy is applied to the
      volume of water.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] Thus, in one embodiment of the method, electrical energy is
      extracted from a volume of water by connecting a load across first
      and second electrodes in contact with a volume of charge-separated
      water, wherein the volume of water comprises a hydrophilic surface
      in liquid communication with the water defining an exclusion zone
      at an interface of the hydrophilic surface and the water, and a
      bulk zone in the volume of water outside of the exclusion zone,
      wherein the first electrode is in the exclusion zone, and wherein
      the second electrode is in the bulk zone. As noted above,
      “charge-separated water” refers to water in contact with a
      hydrophilic surface that initiates the formation of the exclusion
      zone having a net charge opposite that of the bulk zone.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] In another aspect of the invention, a system for extracting
      electrical energy from a volume of water is provided. In one
      embodiment, the system includes a hydrophilic material having a
      hydrophilic surface, a vessel for receiving a hydrophilic surface
      and a volume of water; a first electrode positioned proximate to
      the hydrophilic surface; and a second electrode positioned distal
      to the hydrophilic surface. When the vessel has received a volume
      of water and energy has been applied to the volume of water, the
      first electrode is positioned in an exclusion zone formed at the
      interface of the hydrophilic surface and the water, and the second
      electrode is positioned in a bulk zone in the volume of water
      outside of the exclusion zone.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] In one embodiment, the system includes only those
      components described above (i.e., the system consists of the noted
      components). In another embodiment, the system includes those
      components described above and other components that do not alter
      the characteristics of the system (i.e., the system consists
      essentially of the noted components). Components that are excluded
      from this embodiment include components and conditions used in
      methods for the electrolysis of water, methods for analyzing water
      samples, and electrochemical analytical and synthetic methods
      carried out in water.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] FIG. 1 is a schematic illustration of a representative
      system for carrying out the method of the invention. Referring to
      FIG. 1, system 100 includes vessel 10 that contains volume of
      water 12 and hydrophilic material 14 having hydrophilic surface
      16. On application of energy (e.g., radiant energy), exclusion
      zone 20 and bulk zone 22 form in volume of water 12. Electrode 32
      is positioned in the exclusion zone and electrode 34 is positioned
      in the bulk zone. Electrical energy is extracted from the volume
      of water by applying a load 40 across electrodes 32 and 34. Absent
      continued application of applied energy, the exclusion zone
      contracts. Application of energy during the application of a load
      allows for maintenance of the exclusion zone (i.e., charge
      separation) and simultaneous extraction of electrical energy. The
      following provides a further describes the method of the
      invention. Unexpected phenomenon was observed in water next to
      hydrophilic surfaces. In a zone up to several hundred micrometers
      from the hydrophilic surface, solutes were excluded. Subsequent
      studies showed that the solute-excluding region was
      physico-chemically different from ordinary water, and probably
      liquid crystalline. Qualitative differences between this vicinal
      water and the bulk water farther from the hydrophilic surface were
      demonstrated using NMR, infrared radiation, and UV-Vis optical
      absorption. An additional unexpected result was also observed: the
      excluding region was negatively charged. The potential difference
      between the vicinal water and water remote was approximately 200
      mV, decreasing exponentially with distance from the surface,
      toward zero potential difference at the end of the exclusion zone.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] The results indicate a loss of positive charge from
      otherwise neutral water. This lost positive charge was determined
      to reside in the aqueous zone beyond the exclusion zone. Methods
      showed a large proton concentration in this bulk region. In
      dynamic experiments with pH probes, a wave of protons was detected
      flowing away from the vicinal water and toward the more distant
      bulk water, as the exclusion zone was growing. The result is
      charge separation in the water.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] When an entity whose surface is hydrophilic is placed into
      water, ordering of water molecules next to the surface immediately
      begins. The ordered entity is negative. As this zone builds, the
      quantity of negative charge builds. Meanwhile, the complementary
      positive charges build in the zone beyond this ordered zone to
      provide charge separation. The charge separation is sustained. In
      the method of the invention, electrical current is drawn and
      thereby useful work obtained from charge-separated water.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] In the method of the invention, the buildup of water
      structure, and hence the separation of charge, is powered by
      incident radiant energy (i.e., photons). In an experiment, a
      chamber lined on one side with a hydrophilic surface (i.e.,
      NAFION) was filled with an aqueous suspension of polystyrene
      microspheres. Within several minutes the microspheres moved away
      from the surface leaving an exclusion zone. This zone generally
      remained stable for hours. When light was added the exclusion zone
      immediately began growing, and within five minutes it had grown
      substantially. When the light source was extinguished, the
      exclusion zone returned to its initial size. The effect of
      incident light is reversible.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] Growth of the exclusion zone was wavelength sensitive.
      FIGS. 2A and 2B are graphs comparing exclusion zone expansion
      ratio (defined as the ratio of the exclusion zone width after
      application of energy to the control state, which is the width of
      the exclusion zone prior to the application of energy) as a
      function of wavelength ( 2A UV-Vis and 2B IR). Throughout the
      ultraviolet-visible range the intensity was maintained constant;
      and, the same throughout the infrared range (on the order of 100
      µW). In the latter series, intensities were lower than in the
      former series. All wavelengths increased the size of the negative
      zone, and the increase was wavelength sensitive. The most powerful
      effect occurred at a wavelength of 3 µm. With mode intensity (271
      µW) at 3 µm, in five minutes the exclusion zone (EZ) increased by
      almost a factor of three.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] It is noteworthy that 3 µm is the wavelength most strongly
      absorbed by water, and it causes heating. The temperature increase
      was measured at various points in the chamber. During the
      five-minute exposure, in no instance did the temperature increase
      exceed 1° C. demonstrating that any effect of heating must have
      been secondary. The major impact of these photons appears to be
      non-thermal, although the exact mechanism (i.e., how the photonic
      energy brings about ordering of exclusion zone water and charge
      separation) remains unclear.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] The following experiments determined that electrical power
      can be drawn from the charge-separated water. The setup included a
      NAFION sheet, secured within a sandwich of plastic sheets each
      containing a large open window, so that the NAFION sheet was
      exposed to water. A stainless steel-mesh electrode was placed
      immediately adjacent to the exposed NAFION sheet on one side. This
      served as the negative electrode. The positive electrode, another
      stainless steel mesh, was placed some distance from the sheet,
      either on the same, or the opposite side as the negative
      electrode. The second electrode was positioned so as to lie beyond
      the exclusion zone. The entire assembly was immersed in water. The
      two electrodes were either left open circuited, for potential
      difference measurements, or connected by a load resistor,
      arbitrarily chosen at 10 Kohms, through which current could flow.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] A potential difference on the order of 100-200 mV was
      typically recorded. The voltage was high at first, but generally
      declined with time, depending on whether the load resistor was or
      was not attached. Importantly, the voltage never fell to zero. A
      fraction of the initial voltage persisted indefinitely, implying
      that energy was consistently flowing into the system to recharge
      the system (infrared energy was continuously available to power
      the system). FIG. 3 is a graph illustrating voltage decrease over
      time in an open circuit with no infrared irradiation. FIG. 4 is a
      graph illustrating current over time in a closed circuit with a
      10K resistor.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] Experiments were then undertaken to demonstrate that
      incident infrared illumination increases power output in the
      system. FIG. 5 is a graph illustrating voltage over time in an
      open circuit with infrared irradiation. This data was obtained
      after the voltage had already diminished considerably from an
      initial value. Turning on the light caused an immediate (within
      several minutes) return to the initial (200 mV) voltage, which was
      sustained even for some time after the light had been turned off.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] Lowering the pH of the volume of water tended to increase
      power as indicated in FIG. 6. Adding salt to the volume of water
      induces a substantial positive effect on power production,
      probably because of the increased conductivity of the solution.
      Potassium chloride and sodium chloride exert similar effects. In
      the concentration range 0.1 M to 1 M, power output increased to
      150 microwatts. Considering the electrode-surface areas of
      approximately 3 cm &lt;2&gt;, this increase amounts to about 50
      µW/cm &lt;2&gt;.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] Examples of exclusion zones are illustrated in FIGS. 7A and
      7B. Referring to FIGS. 7A and 7B, the exclusion zones are adjacent
      nucleating surfaces and are denoted by the absence of
      microspheres. As noted above, the exclusion zone is distinct from
      bulk water. A series of measurements including UV-Vis absorption
      spectra, infrared and NMR imaging, and electrical polarization
      showed that water in the exclusion zone was less mobile and more
      ordered than bulk water, and that it was charged.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] Water is known to have a strong absorption peak at a
      wavelength 3.05-3.10 µm, corresponding to a symmetric OH stretch.
      A light source, LED31-PR, which has peak output at 3.1 µm and full
      width at half maximum (FWHM) of 0.55 µm, was used to irradiate
      water in contact with a hydrophilic surface. PERMA PURE® NAFION
      tubing (TT-050, 0.042 in. diam., (PERMA PURE® is a registered
      trademark of PERMA PURE LLC of Cincinnati, Ohio) was suffused with
      a 1 µm carboxylate-microsphere suspension (2.65% solids-latex,
      available from Polysciences Inc. of Warrington, Pa.) with a 1:500
      volume fraction, to a depth of about 1 µm. The chamber was made
      using a thin cover glass adhered to the bottom of a 1-mm thick
      cover slide with a 9-mm circular hole cut in the center, and was
      placed on the stage of a microscope (ZEISS AXIOVERT-35, with
      camera CFW-1310C). (ZEISS® and AXIOVERT® are registered trademarks
      of Carl Zeiss AG Corp. of Oberkochen, Germany.) A pinhole
      (available from Edmund Optics of Barrington, N.J.), 50 µm in
      diameter and 0.25 mm thick, was used to obtain an incident beam of
      restricted diameter. A fabricated holder integrated the pinhole
      and LED into a single unit with the LED mounted close to the
      pinhole. The LED-pinhole axis was vertically oriented.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] When the exclusion zone reached an apparent equilibrium
      state, the incident radiation was turned on. Optical power output
      was 33 µW, and the estimated power received through the pinhole
      was about 2.4 nW. After five minutes, the LED assembly was removed
      and the exclusion zone was photographed through the microscope.
      Referring to FIGS. 7A and 7B, it is apparent that even with modest
      IR exposure, the exclusion zone ( 7B) grew to approximately three
      times its control size ( 7B).<br>
      <br>
      [0064] Exclusion zone width was also tracked over time. This was
      carried out not only with the 3.1 µm source, but also with 2.0 µm
      and 1.75 µm sources (FWHM=0.16 µm and 0.18 µm, respectively). For
      the latter two sources, intensities were maintained at
      approximately 190 µW; but for the 3.1 µm source, power was kept at
      the maximally attainable value, 33 µW.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] During the 10 min exposure at all three wavelengths,
      exclusion zones continued to expand approximately linearly ( FIG.
      8A). The largest effect was seen at 3.1 µm, despite lower incident
      power. To determine whether the EZ continues to expand beyond the
      10-min exposure, the 3.1 µm source was left on at the same
      intensity as above for up to one hour. The ratios increased from
      3.7±0.10 (10 min) to 4.7±0.12 (30 min) and 6.1±0.17 (1 hr)
      respectively. Hence, the exclusion zone continued to expand for up
      to at least one-hour of exposure.<br>
      <br>
      [0066] Post-illumination exclusion zone size dynamics were
      examined. When the infrared light was turned off after 5 minutes
      exposure, exclusion zone width remained roughly constant with
      fluctuations for about 30 min. Then, the size of the exclusion
      zone began decreasing noticeably and continued to decrease for
      approximately one hour.<br>
      <br>
      [0067] To determine the effect of beam intensity on exclusion zone
      expansion, the 2 µm source was employed at three power levels,
      0.21, 0.34, and 1.20 mW. The rate of EZ expansion increased with
      an increase of incident power ( FIG. 8B).<br>
      <br>
      [0068] The results demonstrate that exclusion zone expansion is a
      function of both time and intensity. Exclusion zone growth depends
      on the cumulative amount of incident energy.<br>
      <br>
      [0069] To test whether the expansion arises out of some
      unanticipated interaction between the incident radiation and the
      particular type of microsphere probe, microspheres of different
      size and composition were tested. For carboxylate microspheres of
      diameters 0.5 µm, 1 µm, 2 µm, and 4.5 µm at the same volume
      concentrations (1:500), mean expansion ratios for 5-min exposure
      of 3.1 µm radiation were: 2.41, 2.97, 3.08, and 3.34, respectively
      (n=6). For varied 1 µm microspheres made of carboxylate, sulfate
      (2.65% solids-latex, available from Polysciences Inc. of
      Warrington, Pa.), and silica (SIO 2, available from Polysciences
      Inc. of Warrington, Pa.) under conditions the same as above,
      expansion ratios were 2.97, 3.10 and 1.50. Some material-based and
      size-based variations were noted; the latter arising possibly
      because of different numbers of particles per unit volume; but,
      appreciable radiation-induced expansion was nevertheless seen
      under all circumstances and with all materials. The presence of
      the expansion effect is not material specific.<br>
      <br>
      [0070] The effect of illuminating with IR at different positions
      relative to the NAFION/water interface was compared. For these
      measurements, a sheet of NAFION 117 film (0.007 in. thick,
      Aldrich), approximately 6 mm long and 1.5 mm high, was held by a
      micro-clip (0.75×4-mm jaws, World Precision Instruments) and
      positioned in the vertical plane near the middle of the chamber,
      which was made from a rectangular glass block, length 7 cm, width
      2.5 cm and height 1.5 mm with a rectangular hole, length 3.15 cm
      and width 1.2 cm, cut through from top to bottom and a 1-mm-thick
      glass slide sealing from beneath. The film's upper edge was
      positioned at the solution surface. The vertical scale was
      carefully calibrated using a 1-mm-thick glass slide with face
      markings; one millimeter corresponded to 634 divisions on the
      focus knob. A 50 µm pinhole was placed immediately above the
      specimen in order to restrict incident spot size. To estimate spot
      diameter at different solution depths, a visible source
      (microscope light with green filter, ?=550 nm) was substituted for
      the LED. Beam diameters increased approximately linearly from 160
      µm at the solution surface, to 240 µm at 1.5 mm below the surface
      (these values are only approximate, as diameters will change with
      wavelength). For periods of observation and data collection, where
      some illumination was required, intensity was minimized by use of
      this same filter.<br>
      <br>
      [0071] With the beam first positioned in the middle of the
      exclusion zone, the expansion ratios were measured at different
      depths. FIG. 9A shows that maximum expansion occurred at a depth
      of approximately 450 µm from the solution surface, and was
      detectable well beyond 1 mm. The fact that the maximum expansion
      occurred well below the surface is surprising given the limited IR
      penetration ordinarily expected in water.<br>
      <br>
      [0072] With the same setup as above, the spot was then positioned
      at varying distances from the NAFION-water interface. Results are
      shown in FIG. 9B. Expansion was largest when light was focused in
      the center of the exclusion zone, and fell off on either side,
      although not appreciably. At deeper positions, the near-NAFION
      expansion peak tended to broaden somewhat, possibly because of
      incident-beam broadening; but, the trend was essentially similar
      at all depths. The most notable finding was that even when the
      beam was positioned far from the NAFION surface, the expansion
      effect was appreciable.<br>
      <br>
      [0073] Infrared absorption in water causes a temperature
      elevation. To measure local temperatures, an OMEGAETTE 1M
      datalogger thermometer HH306 was used, with
      stainless-steel-sheathed, compact transition ground-junction probe
      (TJC36 series), small enough (250 µm) to fit within the exclusion
      zone. (OMEGAETTE® is a registered trademark of Omega Engineering,
      Inc., of Stamford, Conn.) With the incident beam positioned to
      elicit the maximum expansion, i.e., centered 175 µm from the
      NAFION surface, the measured temperature increases are shown in
      Table 1.<br>

      [0074] Radiation-induced temperature increases were modest at all
      positions and fairly uniform over the chamber. Slight temperature
      variation was found with depth, implying that the thermal mass of
      the probe itself, immersed by varying extents for measurements at
      varying depths, did not introduce any serious artifact.<br>
      <br>
      [0075] Dynamics of temperature rise were observed. The temperature
      increase occurred steadily, reaching a plateau of about 1° C. at
      10-15 min after tum-on. This plateau was attained at a time that
      the exclusion zone continued to expand (see FIG. 8A). Not only was
      the temperature increase modest, but also the time course of
      temperature rise and exclusion zone expansion were not correlated.<br>
      <br>
      [0076] Infrared effects were seen at depths on the millimeter
      scale, whereas infrared penetration into water is anticipated to
      extend down only on the micrometer scale. One possible explanation
      is that penetration through the exclusion zone is deeper than
      through bulk water.<br>
      <br>
      [0077] The exclusion zone expansion's spectral sensitivity was
      determined. The experimental setup was similar to that described
      above. The about 200 µm wide light beam emerging from the pinhole
      was directed to the middle of exclusion zone, and expansion was
      measured 300 µm below solution surface.<br>
      <br>
      [0078] For the UV and visible sources, maintaining consistent
      optical power output at all wavelengths was achievable within
      +/-10% by adjusting the driver current. IR sources were
      considerably weaker and output power was maintained at a lower
      level, three orders of magnitude lower than in the UV-visible
      ranges.<br>
      <br>
      [0079] For ultraviolet and visible ranges all incident wavelengths
      brought appreciable expansion ( FIG. 2A). The degree of expansion
      increased with increasing wavelength, the exception being the data
      point at 270 nm, which was higher than the local minimum at 300
      nm. The higher absorption may reflect the signature absorption
      peak at 270 nm characteristic of the exclusion zone. Clear
      wavelength sensitivity was also found in the infrared region, the
      most profound expansion occurring at 3.1 µm ( FIG. 2B).
      Recognizing that the optical power available for use in the IR
      region was 1/600 of that in the visible and UV regions, one can
      assume that with comparable power, the IR curve would shift
      considerably upward continuing the upward trend evident in FIG.
      2A. The most profound effect is in the IR region, particularly at
      3.1 µm.<br>
      <br>
      [0080] Interestingly, the overall spectral sensitivity of
      expansion follows closely the spectral sensitivity of water
      absorption. In both cases, there is an overall minimum in the
      near-UV, plus a local maximum at 2.0 µm and a peak at 3.1 µm. If
      not by coincidence, then a connection is implied between IR
      absorption and EZ expansion, although the linkage is apparently
      not through temperature increase, which was both modest and
      temporally uncorrelated. Furthermore, increasing the bath
      temperature actually diminishes exclusion zone size. Evidence that
      the effect is apparently non-thermal.<br>
      <br>
      [0081] FIGS. 10A and 10B present evidence that negative charge
      buildup next to NAFION is associated with proton buildup in the
      bulk water beyond. FIG. 10A shows the bulk-water pH transient that
      occurs during exclusion zone buildup, while FIG. 10B shows the pH
      distribution in the bulk measured after the exclusion zone had
      formed. Whereas the exclusion zone is negatively charged, both
      results, using independent techniques, confirm that the region
      beyond contains an abundance of protons. Indeed, electrodes placed
      in the respective zones are able to deliver substantial current to
      a load confirming charge separation between the exclusion zone and
      the bulk zone beyond.<br>
      <br>
      [0082] FIG. 11 is a graph comparing potential (mV) measured as a
      function of distance from the surface of representative
      hydrophilic materials (NAFION and poly(acrylic acid) gel) useful
      in the method of the invention; the substances are depicted as
      “inside” and water is “outside.” Similar negative potentials have
      been observed with ion-exchange beads composed of crosslinked
      polystyrene divinylbenzene backbones functionalized with sulfonic
      acid groups.<br>
      <br>
      [0083] The following is a description of the methods used in the
      experiments describe above.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0084] Sample Preparation.</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0085] NAFION surfaces, sheets or tubes, were used for creating
      exclusion zones. NAFION was immersed in ultrapure water (NANOpure
      Diamond [trade] 1M p=18.2 MO-cm) to which microspheres were added
      for delineating the exclusion zone boundary. To supply incident
      energy, a series of LEDs were used. All experiments were carried
      out at room temperature in a darkened room.<br>
      <br>
      [0086] Light Sources and Calibration. The LEDs used for infrared
      illumination (available from Gist Optics Co., LTD. of ChangChun,
      China) came in T0-18 packages with parabolic reflectors for
      reducing beam-divergence angle. For the visible range, the LED f 5
      series (available from NICHIA Corporation of Tokushima, Japan) was
      used. For illumination in the UV region, LED model NSHU590
      (NICHIA) emitting at 365 nm, and LED models UVTOP® 265 and UVTOP®
      295 (available from SENSOR ELECTRONIC TECHNOLOGY, Inc. of
      Columbia, S.C.) encapsulated in metal-glass T0-39 packages with
      UV-transparent hemispherical lens optical windows, emitting,
      respectively, at 270 nm and 300 nm, were used. All LEDs were
      driven at 2 kHz by a Model D-31 LED driver (available from Gist
      Optics Co., LTD. of ChangChun, China). Output power was regulated
      for consistency using a model 1815-C optical power meter
      (available from NEWPORT Corporation of Irvine, Calif.) equipped
      with NEWPORT model 818-UV, 818-SL and 818-IR probes.<br>
      <br>
      [0087] In another aspect, the invention provides a method for
      generating electrical energy from a volume of water through the
      formation of an exclusion zone at the interface of air and water.
      In one embodiment of the method, energy is applied to a volume of
      water contained in a vessel to provide an exclusion zone in the
      volume of water at the air-water interface and a bulk zone in the
      volume of water outside of the exclusion zone; a first electrode
      is provided in the exclusion zone and a second electrode in the
      bulk zone; and electrical energy is extracted from the volume of
      water by connecting a load across the electrodes.<br>
      <br>
      [0088] Exclusion zones have been observed not only next to
      hydrophilic surfaces as described above, but also at the air-water
      interface of volumes of water contained in vessel having a surface
      (upper surface) exposed to air. These exclusion zones (i.e., top
      layer of water on the order of 1 mm) appear to be solute free. In
      several chamber-geometrical variants, microspheres were
      consistently excluded from this zone and measurements showed that
      the zone had a negative potential.<br>
      <br>
      [0089] It is possible that the air is not per se that was
      responsible for the presence of the exclusion zone and that the
      exclusion zone was due to the glass surfaces at the chamber's
      edge. At the glass-water interface the meniscus rise was commonly
      solute-free, implying the presence of structure. This structure
      apparently propagates along the water-air interface, covering the
      water surface. In narrow chambers this cover was commonly 1-2 mm
      thick, whereas in wider chambers, where the menisci are more
      widely separated, the structure was thinner. However, replacing
      air with nitrogen, but not oxygen, diminishes the exclusion zone
      implying that oxygen may be playing an important role.<br>
      <br>
      [0090] An array of thin glass sheets, positioned parallel to one
      another and spaced about 1 mm apart, was constructed. The surfaces
      were oriented perpendicular to the air-water interface, and the
      top of the array lay immediately beneath the water surface. The
      negative electrode consisted initially of platinum wires running
      along the top edge of each member of the glass array, situated
      just at the air-water interface. The positive electrode, placed at
      a selectable distance beneath the array, was a platinum mesh.<br>
      <br>
      [0091] Electrical power was extracted from these conditions, just
      as in the presence of hydrophilic surfaces described above. The
      drop of voltage, from the initial value to the plateau, was
      typically only 30-35%, a more modest drop than the situation with
      immersed hydrophilic surface. Thus, ambient energy could
      apparently better sustain the power delivery. Absolute power
      levels were higher. With hydrophilic surface (e.g., NAFION)
      systems, 1 µA currents with 10K resistor were obtained, while in
      this aspect, even with the higher resistance 200K resistor used
      for these experiments, currents on the order of several µA to 10
      µA were obtainable, giving power levels in the range roughly 1
      µW/cm &lt;2 &gt;of surface (i.e., surface parallel to the
      air-water interface).<br>
      <br>
      [0092] The effect of incident IR was found to be more consistent
      albeit less dramatic than in the hydrophilic surface (e.g.,
      NAFION) systems. When IR light was applied from the onset, the
      drop-off of voltage was slowed by about five or six times; and,
      the plateau level remained somewhat higher. When the IR was turned
      on sometime during the plateau, the effect was smaller, sometimes
      being insignificant, other times causing a slight increase.<br>
      <br>
      [0093] Several experimental variants were evaluated including the
      use of different types of electrode materials instead of platinum
      and the addition of salts into the pure water.<br>
      <br>
      [0094] Regarding electrode materials, various combinations of
      platinum, zinc, aluminum and copper were explored. Depending on
      the combination, the voltages were either higher or lower than
      with platinum-platinum. In one advantageous embodiment, the
      electrode combination was platinum (negative) and zinc (positive),
      which gave an initial potential difference on the order of about 1
      V.<br>
      <br>
      [0095] FIGS. 10A 12- 15 are graphs demonstrating the effectiveness
      of generating electrical energy from an air-water interface as
      described above. FIG. 12 is a graph of voltage (V) over time using
      a platinum cathode and zinc electrode. FIG. 13 is a graph
      corresponding to FIG. 12 showing current (amperes) over time. FIG.
      14 is a graph of voltage (V) over time using a platinum cathode
      and zinc electrode using glass slides that are twice (2×) larger
      than those used to obtain the record shown in FIG. 12 (note
      voltage increase). FIG. 15 is a graph corresponding to FIG. 14
      showing current (amperes) over time. When using electrodes of two
      different metals, rather than the same metals for each electrode,
      some difference of output power may be due to the metals'
      electrochemical surface potentials.<br>
      <br>
      [0096] Regarding the addition of salt, modest amounts of salt
      caused the potential difference to increase. To check the effect,
      the salt was added in low concentration during the voltage
      falloff. Voltage magnitude immediately increased, followed by a
      less steep falloff than in the absence of salt, by 0.2 to 0.3V.<br>

      An apparatus includes a hydrophilic surface configured to drive
      flow of a polar fluid responsive to an exclusion zone (EZ) effect,
      the EZ being formed near the hydrophilic surface. An energy source
      may provide energy to form or maintain the EZ.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND</b><br>
      <br>
      [0002] Previous academic work has described the phenomenon of an
      exclusion zone (EZ) generated in proximity to a hydrophilic
      surface.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY</b><br>
      <br>
      [0003] According to embodiments, methods and applications are
      described for attaining useful fluid flows in various practical
      devices. The fluid flows are driven via the generation of an
      exclusion zone (EZ) in a polar fluid in proximity to a hydrophilic
      surface. The flows may be produced substantially without
      conventional energy input, and have been found to persist for
      extended periods of time.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] According to an embodiment, fluid flow may be maintained
      responsive to energy absorbed from the environment. Such absorbed
      energy may be converted to an entropic gradient that maintains the
      fluid flow.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] According to an embodiment, a fluid flow generator includes
      a tube having an inner wall, an inlet end, and an output end. A
      hydrophilic surface formed on at least a portion of the inner wall
      of the tube. The hydrophilic surface of the inner wall is
      configured to form a proximate exclusion zone in polar fluid in
      the tube, and the exclusion zone provides a propulsive force to
      drive fluid flow from the inlet end to the output end of the tube.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] According to an embodiment, a fluid flow generator includes
      a tube having an inlet end, an output end, and an inner wall
      including at least a portion that is hydrophilic; a first fluid
      reservoir coupled to admit a polar fluid to the inlet end of the
      tube; and a second fluid reservoir coupled to receive the polar
      fluid from the output end of the tube. The hydrophilic portion of
      the inner wall is configured to form an exclusion zone in fluid in
      the tube, the exclusion zone providing a propulsive force to drive
      fluid flow from the first fluid reservoir to the second fluid
      reservoir.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] According to an embodiment, a propulsion system includes a
      tube having an inlet end, an output end, and an inner wall
      including at least a portion that is hydrophilic. A mount coupled
      to the tube may be configured to operatively couple to a propelled
      vessel. The hydrophilic portion of the inner wall is configured to
      form an exclusion zone in fluid in the tube, the exclusion zone
      providing a propulsive force to drive the propelled vessel through
      a polar fluid.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] According to an embodiment, a method for pumping a polar
      fluid includes contacting a polar fluid with at least one
      hydrophilic surface, forming at least one exclusion zone in the
      polar fluid proximate to the hydrophilic surface, forming a
      difference in the thickness of different regions of the at least
      one exclusion zone, and propelling the polar fluid from a volume
      proximate a thick region of the at least one exclusion zone to a
      volume proximate a thin region of the at least one exclusion zone.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] According to an embodiment, a method of mixing a fluid
      includes providing a body having a hydrophilic surface, providing
      a fluid reservoir configured to hold a polar fluid, providing a
      polar fluid in the fluid reservoir, and at least partially
      submerging the body in the polar fluid in the reservoir. The
      hydrophilic surface of the body forms an exclusion zone in the
      polar fluid in the reservoir, and the exclusion zone provides a
      propulsive force to drive fluid flow along the hydrophilic
      surface.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] According to an embodiment, a body configured to drive
      polar fluid to flow past the body includes a body having an
      external surface and a hydrophilic surface formed on at least a
      portion of the external surface, wherein the hydrophilic surface
      is configured to form a proximate exclusion zone in polar fluid
      adjacent the body, and the exclusion zone provides a propulsive
      force to drive polar fluid flow substantially parallel to the
      surface of the body.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] According to an embodiment, a method of drawing fluid into
      a tank includes providing a tank having a hydrophilic inner
      surface, providing a fluid passage through a wall of the tank, and
      introducing a polar fluid to the outside of the wall of the tank
      in the vicinity of the fluid passage. The hydrophilic surface
      forms an exclusion zone in polar fluid in the tank, the exclusion
      zone providing a propulsive force to pull the polar fluid into the
      tank.<br>

        DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0041] In the following detailed description, reference is made to
      the accompanying drawings, which form a part hereof. In the
      drawings, similar symbols typically identify similar components,
      unless context dictates otherwise. Other embodiments may be used
      and/or other changes may be made without departing from the spirit
      or scope of the disclosure.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] FIG. 1 is a diagram of a fluid flow generator 101
      configured to pump a polar fluid between reservoirs, according to
      an embodiment. The fluid flow generator 101 includes a tube 102
      having an inlet end 104, an output end 106, and an inner wall 108
      including at least a portion that is hydrophilic. A first fluid
      reservoir 110 may be coupled to admit a polar fluid to the inlet
      end 104 of the tube 102. A second fluid reservoir 112 may be
      coupled to receive the polar fluid from the output end 106 of the
      tube 102. A fluid flow 114 from the inlet 104 to the output 106 of
      the tube 102 is maintained responsive to interactions between the
      polar fluid and the hydrophilic surface 108 of the tube 102. The
      fluid flow 114 may transfer a polar fluid from the first fluid
      reservoir 110 to the second fluid reservoir 112. Optionally, a
      plurality of tubes 102 may be disposed in parallel such that each
      is configured to receive the polar fluid from the same source
      first reservoir 110 and output the polar fluid to substantially
      the same destination second fluid reservoir 112.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] A number of polar fluids were found to exhibit the flow
      described herein. For example, the polar fluid may include water,
      a polar fluid with one or more solutes, water with one or more
      solutes, a polar fluid with one or more suspended particle types,
      water with one or more suspended particle types, an alcohol,
      ethanol, a carboxylic acid, acetic acid, dimethyl sulfoxide, or
      deuterium oxide. For ease of understanding, the polar fluid will
      generally be referred to as water herein, but it is to be
      understood that other polar fluids may be substituted.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] Optionally, an energy source 116 may provide energy to
      maintain fluid flow 114 over an extended period of time or to
      hasten formation of the EZ. The energy source 116 may be an
      explicit part of the structure of the fluid flow generator 116.
      Alternatively, the energy source may be inherent in the ambient
      environment of the fluid flow generator 116. For example, black
      body radiation from surrounding objects may provide energy to the
      tube 102 and the fluid therein.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] The tube 102 may be made of a hydrophilic material such as
      Nafion or a polyacrylic-acid gel. Nafion is a sulfonated
      tetrafluoroethylene based fluoropolymer copolymer having a
      formula:<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      &lt;img class="EMIRef" id="063705001-emi-c00001" /&gt;<br>
      <br>
      [0046] The name Nafion will be used herein. It will be understood
      that compounds related to Nafion may be substituted without
      departing from the spirit or scope of the claims. Other
      hydrophilic surfaces may be used in other embodiments. The tube
      102 may be horizontal or it may be tilted in the vertical plane by
      various degrees. In another embodiment, the output end 106 may
      extend out of the fluid, for example where the surface of the
      fluid in the second reservoir 112 is below the level of the output
      106. For embodiments where the output end 106 is above the surface
      of the fluid in the second reservoir, the tube 102 may be inclined
      to raise the fluid to a level above the surface of the fluid in
      the first reservoir 110. It was found that extending the output
      end 106 out of the fluid increases the flow velocity
      significantly. The tube 102 may be cylindrical, elliptical,
      rectangular, or have other shapes in cross section, for example.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] The fluid level in the first reservoir 110 may be lower
      than, equal to, or greater than the fluid level in the second
      reservoir 112. Hence, the fluid can flow against a hydrostatic
      pressure gradient. The tube 102 may include a plurality of tubes
      corresponding to plural stages of a fluid transmission or lift
      distance.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] FIG. 2A is a side sectional diagram of a portion of the
      tube 102 of FIG. 1, according to an embodiment. The hydrophilic
      portion (which may include substantially the entirety) of the
      inner wall 108 is configured to form an exclusion zone (EZ) 202 in
      a polar fluid in the tube. The EZ provides a propulsive force to
      drive fluid flow, for example from the first fluid reservoir 110
      to the second fluid reservoir 112 shown in FIG. 1.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] Water next to hydrophilic surfaces 108, the EZ 202, has
      characteristics that differ from bulk water 204. Unlike bulk water
      204, the EZ 202 excludes particles and solutes. It is therefore
      referred to as the exclusion zone or EZ. The EZ 202 may be
      extensive, and was found to frequently project up to hundreds of
      micrometers from the hydrophilic surface 108. The EZ 202 is more
      stable and more ordered than bulk water 204, and it was also found
      to carry a net charge. The bulk water 204 immediately beyond the
      EZ 202 was found to be oppositely charged from the EZ 202.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] The separation of charge across an interface 206 between
      the EZ 202 and the bulk water region 204 may be regarded as a
      battery cell or capacitor. The electrical potential across the
      interface 206 can be used to drive current flow. Additionally or
      alternatively, the potential can generate mechanical work in the
      form of charge-driven flow by mechanisms described herein. The
      battery may gain energy by absorbing incident light in a manner
      akin to a photovoltaic photocell: i.e., light incident on the EZ
      202 or regions 204 nearby builds the size of the EZ 202, and hence
      builds the charge separation. In some experiments, infrared
      wavelengths were found to be most effective at adding energy to
      the EZ 202, UV wavelengths were found to be somewhat less
      effective than infrared, and visible wavelengths were found to be
      least effective. However, the relative effectiveness of different
      wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation is still under
      investigation. Moreover, the EZ 202 was found to form and drive
      flow even with no explicit source of electromagnetic radiation.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] All EZ-generating surfaces tested thus far produce flow.
      All non-EZ-generating surfaces such as tubes made of hydrophobic
      materials failed to produce flow. Surfaces that ordinarily produce
      exclusion zones but which were subject to conditions in which the
      EZs are eliminated failed to produce flow. Hence EZ-based features
      are understood to play a role in the energy-transduction
      mechanism.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] FIG. 2B is a side sectional diagram of a portion of the
      tube 102 of FIG. 1 under conditions of fluid flow past the
      hydrophilic wall 108, according to an embodiment. The EZ 202 is
      generally an annular region near the hydrophilic wall 108 that in
      the case of a cylindrical tube 102 is cylindrically symmetric.
      While FIG. 2B illustrates flow inside the tube 102, similar
      principles apply in other cases of flow along hydrophilic
      surfaces. That is, flow can similarly be generated by an EZ 202
      formed on an exterior hydrophilic surface. An embodiment of this
      is described more fully in conjunction with FIG. 5.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] Referring again to FIG. 2B, when the tube 102 was immersed
      in water or filled with water (or another polar fluid) the annular
      EZ 202 shown in FIG. 2A established itself along the tube 102.
      Within minutes, one or more characteristics of the EZ 202 may form
      a differential value, shown as an exaggerated taper in FIG. 2B. In
      experiments, it was observed that the size of the EZ 202
      diminished with distance along the tube. This was observed with
      both Nafion tubes and polyacrylic acid tubes. Alternatively, the
      EZ may not physically taper, but may be characterized by another
      differential or gradient such as charge mobility, degree of order
      within the EZ, or another aspect that accounts for energy exchange
      and the observed flow behavior. Because the flow was
      experimentally found to coincide with a physical size taper,
      description and claims will refer to taper and will be modeled as
      a physical taper herein. However, as used herein, “exclusion zone
      taper” will be understood to refer to a gradient in an EZ property
      along the hydrophilic surface. Accordingly, the EZ may taper down
      from the inlet end 104 to the to the output end 106 of the tube
      102.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] One explanation of the observed flow behavior may be
      understood by reference to the energy contained in a wide EZ
      versus a narrow EZ 202. The direction of flow through the tube 102
      may correspond to flow from a region having a wide EZ to a region
      having a narrower EZ. Wider EZs may contain more charge than
      narrower EZs. In observed situations the charge polarity of the EZ
      was consistently negative; hence, if the near-entry EZ is wider
      than the near-exit EZ, then the near-entry EZ will contain
      relatively more negative charge. The near-exit EZ will contain
      relatively less negative charge.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] According to one explanation, a consideration is the
      battery-like feature described above. Wherever there is negative
      charge in the EZ 202, there is corresponding positive charge in
      the region beyond 204. The corresponding positive charge has been
      experimentally confirmed. Hence, the core 204 of the tube 102 can
      contain positive charge. This positive charge may be highest at
      the entry, lowest at the exit. Whereas the negative charge is
      embedded in the structural matrix of the EZ, the positive charge
      is in the form of free hydronium ions, i.e., protonated, or
      positively charged water; and thus the positive charge is freely
      mobile. Hence, the concentration of positively charged water ions
      may be higher at the entry than at the exit. Looked at from one
      perspective, this charge gradient may drive the water through the
      tube.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] According to a thermodynamic model, a wide EZ 202 state
      represents a lower entropy than a narrow EZ 202 state. Fluid in
      the tube 102 flows left-to-right as illustrated to move from a low
      entropy state to high entropy state.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] The direction of the taper of the exclusion zone 202 may be
      random. For example, this may be useful if the tube 102 is used to
      circulate water in a contiguous tank, such as a single tank or two
      tanks also coupled by a second passage. The second passage may
      include an EZ pump or may respond to a slight hydrostatic pressure
      difference caused by the EZ pump 102. In such an arrangement, the
      direction of circulation may not be important. Moreover, the
      direction of flow may or may not correspond to the direction of
      taper.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] Alternatively, a flow direction generator 208 may be used
      to generate a direction of flow 114 (shown from left-to-right in
      FIG. 2B). The flow direction generator 208, shown for simplicity
      as a separate object, may be intrinsically incorporated into the
      tube 102 or the hydrophilic surface 108, such as by tapering the
      tube 102 or providing a differential hydrophilicity or varying the
      surface area of the hydrophilic surface 108 from one end to the
      other of the tube 102. Separate flow direction generators 208 may
      include, for example, a small auxiliary pump, a differentially
      applied energy source 116, a separate motive power source, etc.
      The determination of flow direction (including a formation of EZ
      characteristic differential) is described more fully in
      conjunction with FIG. 3. The flow direction generator 208 may be
      an exclusion zone taper generator.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] Alternatively, the pump configuration of FIGS. 1, 2A, and
      2B (and other embodiments shown herein) may be used to boost the
      efficiency or output of a conventional pump. In this mode, a
      conventional pump may be used to provide a portion of the fluid
      pumping, with EZ-driven pumping providing additional energy. For
      example, this approach may be envisioned as an embodiment where
      the flow direction generator 208 of FIG. 2B includes a
      conventional fluid pump, but where the flow direction generator is
      not shut off after establishing the direction of flow.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] FIG. 3 is a flow chart 301 summarizing the fluid flow
      generation process used by apparatuses that operate according to
      principles described in conjunction with FIGS. 1, 2A, and 2B,
      according to an embodiment. In step 302, a polar fluid is received
      adjacent to a hydrophilic surface. For example the hydrophilic
      surface may be the inside of a tube, as described above.
      Alternatively, the hydrophilic surface may be on a body configured
      to be placed in a tank to cause mixing, or on one or more walls of
      a fluid passage into or within a tank, as described below.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] Proceeding to step 304, an EZ is established. Establishment
      of an EZ may occur substantially spontaneously. Alternatively, the
      EZ may be established in concert with receipt of incident energy
      by the fluid. It has been experimentally confirmed that EZ
      formation is particularly responsive to ultrasonic and sonic
      energy. According to embodiments, electromagnetic radiation,
      applied sonic energy, and/or other forms of transmitted energy may
      provide a catalyst function and/or contribute energy to the EZ
      state. Some or all of the entropic energy of the EZ may correspond
      to a conversion from molecular kinetic energy corresponding to the
      temperature of the fluid.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] Next, in step 306, a direction of flow is established.
      According to some embodiments, for example in mixing applications,
      the direction of flow through the tube may be of minor importance.
      For example, the flow of the polar fluid may be bidirectional and
      the inlet and output ends of the tube may be interchangeable. A
      straight tube with a uniformly hydrophilic wall, with no impressed
      motion, and with no differential incident energy from an energy
      source may exhibit a substantially random flow direction. In such
      a case, minor temperature gradients or other perturbations to
      Brownian motion may result in a small net movement of fluid
      through at least a portion of the tube. In such a case, a very
      slight EZ characteristic differential may arise. The slight EZ
      characteristic differential may tend to amplify itself as a
      greater and greater fluid flow rate increases the slope or
      difference in the characteristic. The generation of a differential
      value in an exclusion zone characteristic is shown in step 308.
      However, one should realize that steps 306 and 308 may proceed
      substantially simultaneously. Steps 306 and 308 are shown as
      separate steps for clarity of description. According to
      experimental observations, the differential characteristic may be
      the thickness of the exclusion zone.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] Reversal of fluid flow direction has not been observed
      experimentally. Rather, once flow was established, flow direction
      remained constant, although variations in flow rate were observed.
      The Examples provide information regarding observed flow
      responses.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] Alternatively, the direction of flow may be set. Flow
      direction can be set in a number of ways. In uniform tubes in a
      quiescent fluid, flow direction may be unpredictable; but once
      begun, it continues indefinitely in the initial direction. Flow
      direction may be set by tapering all or a portion of the tube,
      such that the tube has a varying diameter. In tapered tubes, flow
      was confirmed to proceed from large to small diameter; hence flow
      direction can be set by tapering the tube, either gradually, or
      more abruptly as in a step function. Alternatively, the wall may
      be formed with a differential hydrophilicity. More hydrophilic
      surfaces, e.g., those that are highly charged, were found to
      generate larger EZs. Hence by grading the degree of hydrophilicity
      along the tube, either progressively as in a gradient, in a step,
      or as a combination; one can set flow direction. For example,
      direction of flow may be set by providing larger hydrophilicity at
      the inlet end of a surface or tube than the hydrophilicity at the
      output end of the surface or tube.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] Alternatively, a conventional pump may be configured to set
      a direction of fluid flow from the inlet end of the tube to the
      output end of the tube. Once flow is started in a direction, it
      continues in that direction. Alternatively, the inlet end of the
      tube may be energized, such as by illumination with higher
      intensity light than the output end (or the output end may be
      shaded). The higher intensity light may drive formation of a
      larger EZ, which may tend to generate a flow direction from the
      inlet to the output end of the tube.<br>
      <br>
      [0066] As indicated above, the direction of flow has been
      experimentally observed to correspond to the direction of an EZ
      taper. Flows have been observed to progress from a region of large
      EZ thickness to a region or smaller EZ thickness. Accordingly, it
      has been hypothesized that the observed EZ taper is responsible
      for driving flow.<br>
      <br>
      [0067] Proceeding to step 310, flow is generated and maintained
      from the EZ taper. The flow in the tube was observed to continue
      without substantial diminution of speed, for at least one hour.<br>
      <br>
      [0068] While many experiments were performed without any
      identifiable energy source 116, it is believed that energy was
      provided by the environment, for example in the form of incident
      radiation or inherent in molecular behavior corresponding to
      temperature, e.g. corresponding to vibrational, rotational, and/or
      translational movement of fluid molecules.<br>
      <br>
      [0069] Accordingly, the process 301 includes step 312, wherein the
      fluid in the tube, and the EZ in particular, receives energy from
      the environment or from an explicit energy source. For example,
      the tube may be configured to receive radiant electromagnetic
      energy, sonic energy, or ultrasonic energy and responsively
      maintain the exclusion zone and the propulsive force. For example,
      the tube may be configured to receive radiant energy having 3100
      nanometers wavelength. The apparatus shown in FIG. 1 (and other
      apparatuses shown below) may include a radiant energy source 116
      configured to provide the radiant energy to the tube. For example
      the energy source 116 may include an infrared or ultraviolet LED
      or LED array. Alternatively, an energy source 116 may include a
      sonic or ultrasonic compression wave source.<br>
      <br>
      [0070] Placement of step 312 is indicated as falling outside the
      linear progression of steps 302 to 310. According to one
      interpretation, step 312 may proceed substantially continuously,
      forming an exchange medium with the entropy state of the EZ and
      the translational motion of the fluid in the tube 102. According
      to another interpretation, step 312 may occur in concert with one
      or more of steps 302 to 310. For example, energy may flow into
      formation 304 of the EZ 202 and into maintenance of the EZ during
      fluid flow 310.<br>
      <br>
      [0071] Referring again to FIG. 1, the first and second reservoirs
      may be operatively coupled for fluid flow therebetween via a flow
      channel separate from the tube 102. For example, fluid may
      re-circulate from the output reservoir 112 to the inlet reservoir
      110 through another flow generator 101 configured to drive the
      fluid via the EZ mechanism, through a conventional pump, or via
      natural flow through a non-powered passage. Alternatively, the
      first and second reservoirs may be contiguous, such as in a mixer
      or other apparatus configured to provide flow within a vessel. An
      example is a fish tank circulation pump.<br>
      <br>
      [0072] The apparatus described in conjunction with FIG. 1 may be
      used in a variety of applications. For example, the fluid flow
      generator may be a portion of an irrigation system. Such an
      application may be represented by the apparatus 101 wherein water
      in a tank 110 may be transported to sites 112 where it is needed.
      The transport tubes 102 are hydrophilic and built so that the flow
      direction is away from the tank 110. In one embodiment these sites
      112 are agricultural sites. In other embodiments they are other
      types of sites 112 requiring water. According to an embodiment,
      the tank need not be elevated to create hydrostatic pressure.
      According to an embodiment the driving energy comes from the sun.
      According to an embodiment, a solar collector may serve as a power
      source 116 according to the EZ phenomenon. Optionally, a
      birefringent filter may couple light into the solar collection
      region in the vicinity of the tube 102. For example, such a filter
      may couple light at wavelengths to which the EZ responds to the
      EZ, and couple other wavelengths to other solar energy conversion
      apparatus(es). Using solar power, source logistics may be
      simplified. Another advantage is that flow appears likely to be
      maximal during hot periods, when water is needed most, and minimal
      during cooler periods when it is needed least. Hence, the delivery
      could match demand in a natural way, e.g., with no need for the
      complexities of external flow regulation structure.<br>
      <br>
      [0073] The fluid flow generator may be a portion of a water
      transport system from an aquifer or cistern. Such an application
      may be represented by the apparatus 101 wherein water can be
      transported upward from an underground aquifer, cistern, or
      container 110 to sites 112 at ground level where it is needed.
      Such sites may include but are not limited to homes, factories,
      villages, and agricultural areas. According to an embodiment, no
      explicit external power source 116 is needed. According to another
      embodiment, a radiant energy source 116 may provide radiant energy
      to pump the EZ. Such a source may include a light pipe. In one
      embodiment the hydrophilic tube 102 runs from the source 110
      directly to a collecting tank 112. In another embodiment the water
      receiving location(s) may correspond to a pipe network or other
      liquid volume that may not resemble a tank or identifiable bulk
      reservoir. For example, the intake 110 and output 112 reservoirs
      may be respectively or commonly comprised of a porous medium. In
      situations in which the height difference between water source 110
      and output 112 is too great, intermediate reservoirs may be staged
      in a plurality. For example, intermediate reservoirs may be staged
      at distances corresponding to a desired EZ taper 206 (FIG. 2B). An
      embodiment of a fluid pump including multiple stages (and
      intermediate reservoirs) is described more fully in conjunction
      with FIG. 8.<br>
      <br>
      [0074] The fluid flow generator may be a portion of an infusion
      device, such as a medical device configured to pump fluid into a
      human body or within a human body. Such an application may be
      represented by the apparatus 101 wherein drugs and/or other
      solutes and fluids may be infused from a chamber 110 to specific
      body sites 112. The chamber 110 may be situated within the body or
      adjacent the skin of the person or test subject. The transport
      tube 102 is made of a biocompatible material. In one embodiment
      the material is polyHEMA, which, for example, is used in soft
      contact lenses, and has been shown to exhibit substantial
      exclusion zones. The infusion may occur without need for a battery
      or pump separate from the tube(s) 102. The principle is applicable
      in a situation requiring slow infusion of a polar liquid, with or
      without dissolved solutes or suspended particles.<br>
      <br>
      [0075] The fluid flow generator may be a portion of a toy or
      amusement. Because the propulsion mechanism is counter-intuitive,
      people observing the flow phenomena outlined above are often
      astonished. The astonishment opens an opportunity for creating
      children's toys and adult amusements. One embodiment is a
      boat-like device that self-propels. Another embodiment is a
      fountain or water feature that spews water upward or sideways or
      some combination thereof, from a body of water, the latter either
      natural or supplied in a container 110.<br>
      <br>
      [0076] Further, since artificial light can drive the flow just as
      well as natural light, the toys and amusements, as well as other
      devices, can be made to function only when the lights are turned
      on. This can be achieved by designing the system in such a way
      that there is a threshold for flow, which is exceeded only when
      lights are turned on.<br>
      <br>
      [0077] The fluid flow generator may be a portion of a heating
      system, cooling system, or heating and cooling system. A design
      constraint in electronic integrated circuit development is heat
      generation. Because infrared radiation is particularly effective
      at building EZs, and EZs drive flow, fluid channels built directly
      into, or around, IC chips may be driven by blackbody radiation,
      conducted, or convective heat transfer from the integrated circuit
      and/or packaging. Accordingly, flow rate, which depends on EZ
      formation, may provide an indication of a rate of radiation, which
      is dependent upon blackbody temperature. (Adjustments may be made
      for non-ideal behavior.) According to an embodiment, the tube 102
      may form a portion of a temperature sensor.<br>
      <br>
      [0078] When used for heat exchange purposes, a portion of the
      generated heat (especially one or more portions corresponding to
      global or local maximum response) may drive flow. The heat
      transferred to the fluid could thereby pass through a heat
      exchanger and transfer the heat to the surrounding air.<br>
      <br>
      [0079] Chip cooling may be represented by the apparatus 101
      wherein 110 corresponds to a heat source and 112 to a heat sink
      such as a liquid-to-air heat exchanger. The tube 102 may be formed
      in an IC or IC packaging in a continuous fashion. The continuous
      tube may be represented by a second tube (not shown) configured to
      carry fluid from location 112 to location 110. The tube is filled
      with water or another polar liquid. The tube may for example be
      etched substantially square or as a truncated pyramid in the IC
      substrate. The top may correspond to the IC package. One or more
      of the top, bottom, or the sides of the tube 102 may be
      hydrophilic or coated with a hydrophilic material. The other
      surfaces may be hydrophobic. In some embodiments, directionality
      does not matter; however, if desired, the water-flow direction may
      be predetermined by imposing a hydrophilic taper or step function,
      or size taper or step function.<br>
      <br>
      [0080] The channel 102 may be built into the IC substrate, such as
      in flow channels etched into the wafer back during or prior to IC
      manufacture. Since flow can be generated past a single hydrophilic
      surface, only one of the four flat surfaces of the channel needs
      to contain the hydrophilic material. This same principle can be
      applied, in other embodiments, to cool other heat-generating
      devices such as an engine or motor.<br>
      <br>
      [0081] Alternatively, the fluid flow generator may be a portion of
      a fluid mixing system. FIG. 5 illustrates one embodiment.
      Alternatively, the fluid flow generator may be a portion of an
      aquarium circulation system, which may be represented by FIG. 1,
      in a manner analogous to applications described above.<br>
      <br>
      [0082] FIG. 4 is a diagram of a fluid propulsion system 401,
      according to an embodiment. The fluid propulsion system 401,
      includes a tube 102 having an inlet end 104, an output end 106,
      and an inner wall including at least a portion 108 that is
      hydrophilic; and a mount 402 coupled to the tube 102 and
      configured to operatively couple to a propelled vessel 404. The
      hydrophilic portion 108 of the inner wall is configured to form an
      exclusion zone in fluid 406 in the tube, the exclusion zone
      providing a propulsive force 408 to reactively drive the propelled
      vessel 404 through a polar fluid 406.<br>
      <br>
      [0083] The tube mount 402 may be configured to couple directly to
      a hull or body of the propelled vessel 404. For example, the
      propelled vessel 404 may be a boat, a submarine, a pool or spa
      skimmer, or an icebreaker.<br>
      <br>
      [0084] The tube 102 may operate substantially as described for the
      tube of the fluid flow generator described in FIGS. 1, 2A, 2B, and
      3, wherein the fluid flow 408 acts as a thrust and wherein the
      propelled vessel 404 is propelled 410 reactive to the thrust 408.
      The fluid propulsion system 401 may include a plurality of tubes
      (not shown), and the mount 402 may be configured to operatively
      couple the plurality of tubes to the propelled vessel 404.<br>
      <br>
      [0085] In one embodiment, the tubes 102 are coupled to the hull
      along the sides of the propelled vessel 404, as illustrated. In
      other embodiments, the tubes 102 may be situated beneath the
      propelled vessel 404, behind the propelled vessel 404, or in front
      of the propelled vessel 404. Tubes may be controlled as described
      above, in conjunction with the fluid flow generator 101. Flow
      directionality is established in a number of ways. In one
      embodiment, tapering of the tubes sets the flow direction. In
      another embodiment flow direction is established by setting up a
      hydrophilicity gradient along each tube. In yet another
      embodiment, a small auxiliary pump could set the flow direction.<br>
      <br>
      [0086] Flow rate may be highest when exposure to incident
      electromagnetic radiation is highest. Thus, higher speed may be
      obtainable by raising the tubes closer to the water surface, where
      they may receive relatively more radiation. Flow rate can also be
      regulated by raising the flow engine so that a fraction of tubes
      are out of the water, or by regulating the closing/opening of a
      fraction of the tubes with lids or valves (not shown).
      Alternatively, the vessel 404 may include conventional power,
      sail, oar, or paddle driven propulsion. The hull of the vessel 404
      may include a hydrophilic coating configured to provide additional
      propulsion to the vessel 404.<br>
      <br>
      [0087] FIG. 5 is a diagram of an EZ mixer 501, according to an
      embodiment. A body 502 having a hydrophilic surface 508 may be at
      least partially submerged in a polar fluid 504. The polar fluid
      504 may be held by a fluid reservoir 506. The hydrophilic surface
      508 forms an exclusion zone in the polar fluid 504 in the
      reservoir 506. The exclusion zone provides a propulsive force to
      drive fluid flow 510 along the hydrophilic surface 508.
      Alternatively or additionally, the fluid reservoir 506 may be
      configured with one or more hydrophilic surfaces such as
      hydrophilic walls (not shown). Mixing of components to achieve
      uniformity ordinarily requires energy. With the various flow
      mechanisms described herein, mixing is achievable automatically by
      hydrophilic surfaces throughout the volume. In one embodiment the
      surfaces can be hydrophilic tube sections scattered throughout in
      various spatial arrangements. In another embodiment the
      hydrophilic surfaces can be vertically oriented slabs, straight or
      curved. Such arrangements can be used to create flow and thereby
      facilitate mixing.<br>
      <br>
      [0088] When fluid from a large volume needs to be mixed with fluid
      in a small container, a method involving a wall penetration may be
      used as shown in FIG. 6. By implementing such approaches, mixing
      is achievable with no external energy source other than that from
      the environment.<br>
      <br>
      [0089] FIG. 6 is a diagram of a system 601 for drawing fluid 602
      into a tank 604 using the EZ flow effect, according to an
      embodiment. A tank or cylinder 604, here shown embodied as a tube
      having stoppers 606a, 606b in its ends, has a hydrophilic inner
      surface 108. The tank may be filled with a polar fluid. As
      described above, the hydrophilic inner surface 108 of the tank 604
      builds an EZ 202 proximate the hydrophilic surface. The EZ 202
      extends from the hydrophilic surface 108 some distance to an
      interface 206 with bulk fluid 204.<br>
      <br>
      [0090] A fluid passage 608 is provided through a wall of the tank
      604. A polar fluid 602 is provided outside of the wall of the tank
      604 in the vicinity of the fluid passage 608. In FIG. 6, this is
      indicated as the tank 604 being immersed in the polar fluid 602.
      The hydrophilic surface 108 applies an exclusion zone 202 to polar
      fluid in the tank, the exclusion zone 202 providing a propulsive
      force to pull more of the polar fluid via a fluid flow 610 into
      the tank. For example, the walls of the tank 604 may be elastic.
      In this case, the incoming polar fluid 602 increases the pressure
      and/or the volume inside the tank 604 by expanding the elastic
      walls of the tank 604.<br>
      <br>
      [0091] FIG. 7 is a diagram of a piston engine configured to be
      driven by an EZ-induced flow effect, according to an embodiment.
      With reference to FIG. 6, rather than expanding elastic walls or
      pushing out a stopper 606, the incoming fluid may be used to push
      a piston 702 inside a cylinder 704 formed with hydrophilic walls
      108. An opposing cylinder (not shown) may be formed to push in an
      opposing direction, or alternatively, the opposing end of the
      cylinder 704 may be plugged and increasing pressure inside the
      cylinder 704 may push a single piston 702. The piston 702 may be
      coupled to a crank 706 via a connecting rod 707. The crank 706 may
      drive a mechanical load (not shown) such as power generation
      equipment or other energy consuming apparatus. A plurality (not
      shown) of pistons 702 may be coupled to the crank 706. One or more
      pistons 702 may be configured to cooperate with the EZ drive
      mechanism and valves 708, 710, 714 to provide substantially
      continuous torque responsive to EZ forces in a corresponding
      plurality (not shown) of cylinders 704. Alternatively, torque may
      be applied to the crank 706 intermittently, for example to hold
      the piston 702 in a constant position during an intake phase of a
      power cycle.<br>
      <br>
      [0092] One or more fluid exchange valves, which may include an
      inlet valve 708 and an outlet valve 710 may be timed to admit a
      solute-containing polar fluid 712 upon which the hydrophilic
      surface 108 of the cylinder 704 acts to form an EZ 202. During an
      intake phase, the cylinder may be at substantially constant
      pressure and minimum volume. The solute-containing fluid 712 flows
      in through the fluid inlet valve 708 to replace remaining output
      fluid, which is expelled through the fluid outlet valve 710. The
      one or more exchange valves 708, 710 are closed after the fluid
      has been exchanged.<br>
      <br>
      [0093] An EZ 202 forms inside the cylinder 704. Upon formation of
      the EZ, one or more drive valves 714 opens to admit solute
      containing drive fluid to the EZ in the cylinder. As described
      above, the EZ provides a propulsive force (actually an impulsive
      force) to pull the drive fluid into the cylinder 704. The inflow
      716 of solute-containing drive fluid 602 drives the piston 702 to
      expand the volume inside the cylinder 704. Optionally, the drive
      valve may include a plurality of fluid inlet passages 714a, 714b
      configured to sequentially open as the volume of fluid in the
      cylinder 704 expands during the piston 702 stroke. At the end of
      the piston stroke, one or more drive valves 714a, 714b may be
      closed, and the exit valve 710 (which may be combined with the
      inlet valve 708) is opened to allow the fluid to escape while the
      piston returns to the minimum volume position. The cycle is then
      repeated. The cycle may provide unidirectional or reciprocating
      rotation of the crank 706.<br>
      <br>
      [0094] FIG. 8 is a diagram of a multi-stage fluid pump 801 based
      on principles disclosed herein, according to an embodiment.
      Referring again to FIGS. 2A, 2B, for example, a nominal fluid
      transmission distance may span a single tube 102. Alternatively,
      the nominal fluid transmission distance may be split into a
      plurality of stages, each stage configured to transmit the fluid a
      portion of a transport distance. FIG. 8 illustrates a plurality of
      stages or portions of stages 802a, 802b, 802c. Each stage 802
      includes a corresponding transport tube 102a, 102b, 102c
      configured to transport a polar fluid responsive to an EZ 202
      taper as shown in FIG. 2B. One or more intermediate reservoirs
      804a, 804b, 804c receive fluid from a corresponding transport tube
      102a, 102b, 102c. The transport tubes 102a, 102b, 102c are
      configured to provide the fluid to the receiving intermediate
      reservoir 804a, 804b, 804c across an antisiphon valve 806a, 806b,
      806c, which may be formed as an air gap (as shown), a low
      back-pressure valve, or other apparatus configured to prevent
      hydrostatic communication between an inlet 104(1) of a first
      transport tube 102(1) and an output 106n of a last transport tube
      102n. Thus, in the case of a vertical stack, each stage only needs
      to provide EZ taper pumping against the hydrostatic height of the
      individual stage transport tube (e.g. 102b); or in the case of a
      horizontal stack, each stage only needs to overcome frictional
      losses corresponding to the total length of each transport tube.<br>
      <br>
      [0095] The length of each transport tube 102 and each stage 802
      may be selected according to a desired EZ slope 206 (FIG. 2B). A
      larger EZ slope provides greater pumping power, and therefore a
      higher flow rate. Each transport tube 102a, 102b, etc. empties
      into a corresponding intermediate reservoir 802a, 802b. A next
      transport tube 102b, 102c then pulls the fluid from respective
      intermediate reservoirs 802a, 802b and pumps the fluid, via the EZ
      flow method described herein, to the next intermediate reservoir
      in sequence. Accordingly, a sequence of stages 802(1), . . . ,
      802a, 802b, 802c, . . . , 802n can raise a polar fluid from a
      first elevation 820 to a second elevation 822 higher than the
      first elevation 820.<br>
      <br>
      [0096] Referring to FIG. 3, the flow direction of the transport
      tubes 102 must be established 306, which in turn determines the
      direction of the EZ taper 308 needed to generate flow 310. The
      process 306, 308 may be thought of as priming a pump. Similarly,
      referring back to FIG. 8, the multistage fluid pump 801 is primed
      to initiate flow. For example, each stage may include one or more
      vents 808a, 808b formed in a structural tube 810. A priming valve
      tube 812 may be located circumferential to the structural tube 810
      with a lubricant or lubricating interface disposed between the
      structural tube 810 and the priming valve tube 812. In an initial
      configuration, the priming valve tube 812 is rotated such that
      structural tube vents 808a, 808b are misaligned with corresponding
      vents 814a, 814b in the priming valve tube 812 (configuration not
      shown). Airspace 816a, 816b, 816c above the nominal surface 818a,
      818b, 818c of the respective intermediate reservoirs 802a, 802b,
      802c is filled with priming fluid (which may be substantially the
      same as the fluid to be pumped), which, because the vents 808a,
      814a; 808b, 814b; and 808c, 814c are closed, causes the first
      stage inlet 104(1) to be in hydrostatic communication with the
      last stage outlet 106n. Accordingly, because the polar fluid is
      substantially incompressible, a suction pump (not shown)
      temporarily attached to the last stage outlet 106n can pull fluid
      through the entire multistage pump 801. After a period of external
      pumping, the EZs in each transport tube 102(1), . . . , 102a,
      102b, 102c, , 102n establish a direction of taper corresponding to
      upward flow. Upon establishing the flow direction, the priming
      valve tube 812 is rotated to align the vents 808a, 814a; 808b,
      814b; 808c, 814c to allow the airspaces 816a, 816b, 816c to empty
      to the nominal reservoir surface 818a, 818b, 818c. Optionally, the
      priming tube vents 814a, 814b, 814c may be positioned and/or
      elongated to provide sequential opening of the structural tube
      vents 808a, 808b, 808c for example from bottom to top in order to
      gradually release each stage 802(1), . . . 802a, 802b, 802c, . . .
      802n from bottom to top from suction (priming) pumping to EZ taper
      pumping, while supporting hydrostatic head with the suction pump
      (not shown) from the top.<br>
      <br>
      [0097] The multistage fluid pump 801 may thus be lowered to
      operate as a sump pump, bilge pump, or well pump without providing
      any active pump at the bottom of the sump, bilge, or well. If
      prime is lost, the priming tube may be rotated to sequentially
      close the vents 808 from top to bottom while the polar fluid is
      pumped down from the top. The priming sequence may then be
      repeated. Optionally, the multistage fluid pump 801 may be
      preemptively pumped downward from the top, then re-primed at
      intervals selected to stop build-up or clean scale or other
      impurities from the hydrophilic surfaces of the transport tubes
      102(1), . . . , 102a, 102b, 102c, . . . , 102n and/or other
      components.<br>
      <br>
      [0098] The fluid flow method and apparatuses described herein may
      be used for a variety of purposes. As shown above, the flow may be
      used to move fluid, to reactively power a watercraft or the like,
      to mix a fluid, to expand against a pressurized volume, or to
      power a piston engine. The movement of fluid may also be harnessed
      to generate power. Such power generation may include or be in
      addition to or instead of driving electric current using the
      charge separation effect described above.<br>
      <br>
      [0099] FIG. 9 is a block diagram showing a system 901 for
      generating electric power from EZ-driven fluid flow, according to
      an embodiment. An EZ pump 902 pumps fluid from a reservoir 110 to
      create a fluid flow 114. For example, the EZ pump 902 may be
      configured as one or more transport tubes 102 (FIGS. 1, 2A, 2B,
      8), as a fluid mixing arrangement 501 (FIG. 5), as a fluid
      pressurizing system 602 (FIG. 6), or as a fluid drive valve 714
      and cylinder 704 (FIG. 7). The fluid flow may optionally drive a
      fluid motion to mechanical motion transducer 904. For example, the
      transducer 904 may include a piston 702, rod 707, and crankshaft
      706 as shown in FIG. 7. The transducer 904 may alternatively
      include a turbine or other arrangement configured to transfer
      energy from the fluid flow to mechanical energy. The fluid motion
      to mechanical motion transducer 904 may couple to a mechanical
      motion to electrical pressure apparatus 906 such as a generator or
      alternator, etc. The mechanical motion to electrical pressure
      apparatus 906 may drive a load or storage device 908 that may, for
      example, be directly coupled to the apparatus 906 as a dedicated
      load, or which may alternatively include a power grid.<br>
      <br>
      [0100] In an alternative embodiment, the transducer 904 may be
      omitted, and the fluid flow 114 may operatively couple 910 to the
      electrical pressure apparatus 906. For example, the electrical
      pressure apparatus 906 may include an electro-hydro-dynamic (EHD)
      transducer that generates current flow responsive to a magnetic
      field produced by the moving fluid. Alternatively, the electrical
      pressure apparatus 906 may include electrodes configured to couple
      to the potential difference between the EZ and bulk fluid
      described above.<br>
      <br>
      [0101] The pumping effect of an EZ has been measured in several
      experiments, some of which are presented in examples below.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLES</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Example 1</b><b><br>
      </b><b>Sample Preparation</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0102] The hydrophilic substances used in the experiments included
      Nafion tubing (TT-050 with 0.042 in. diameter, Perma Pure LLC) and
      Nafion 117 per-fluorinated membrane (0.007 in. thick, Aldrich).
      Before use, they were immersed in deionized water for 10 min. All
      experiments were carried out at 22-23° C. and in a dark room to
      minimize background noise.<br>
      <br>
      [0103] All experiments used deionized water, which was obtained
      from a NANOpure® Diamond™ ultrapure water system. The purity of
      water from this system is certified by a resistivity value up to
      18.2 mO-cm, which exceeds ASTM, CAP and NCCLS Type I water
      requirements. In addition, the deionized water was passed through
      a 0.2-micron hollow fiber filter for ensuring bacteria- and
      particle-free water.<br>
      <br>
      [0104] Polybead carboxylate microspheres (2.65% solids-latex,
      Polysciences Inc.), hydrophilic silica microspheres (SiO2,
      Polysciences Inc.), and sulfate microspheres (2.65% solids-latex,
      Polysciences Inc.) were used to delineate the extent of the
      exclusion zone. The volume fractions of these aqueous microsphere
      suspensions were set to 1 to 500.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Experimental Setup</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0105] A Zeiss Axiovert-35 microscope was used for all
      observations. A high-resolution single chip color digital camera
      (CFW-1310C), well suited for bright-field and low-light color
      video microscopy, as well as for photo documentation was used for
      color imaging. It has a pixel resolution of 1360×1024 with a
      dynamic range of 10 bits. The CCD sensor of that camera employs
      the widely used Bayer color-filter arrangement.<br>
      <br>
      [0106] Two types of chambers were used. The first was made using a
      thin cover glass stuck to the bottom of a 1-mm thick cover slide
      with a 9-mm circular hole in the center; that chamber was used for
      experiments with Nafion tubing. The second was the same except
      that the hole was a rectangle of length 3.15 cm×width 1.2 cm×and
      height 1.5 mm, which was for experiments with Nafion membrane,
      secured with a “micro-vessel” clip to stand up in the middle of
      chamber (0.75×4-mm jaws, World Precision Instruments).<br>
      <br>
      <b>Light Source and Incident Power Measurement</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0107] For sample illumination a series of LEDs were used.
      Infrared LEDs (Gistopics) came in TO-18 packages with parabolic
      reflectors for reducing beam-divergence angle. For the visible
      range, LED f5 series (Nichia) was used. And, for illumination in
      the UV region we used LED NSHU590 (Nichia) emitting at 365 nm, and
      LEDs UVTOP® 265 and UVTOP® 295 (Sensor Electronic Technology)
      encapsulated in metal-glass TO-39 packages with UV-transparent
      hemispherical lens optical windows, emitting, respectively, at 270
      nm and 300 nm. All LEDs were driven at 2 kHz by a Model D-31 LED
      driver (Gistoptics). Output power was regulated for consistency
      using a Newport 1815-C optical power meter with Newport 818-UV,
      818-SL and 818-IR probes.<br>
      <br>
      [0108] To obtain an incident beam of small diameter, a pinhole 50
      microns in diameter and 0.25 mm thickness (Edmund Optics) was
      used. An integrated holder was built to keep the pinhole and LED
      together as a single unit, the LED positioned as close as possible
      to the pinhole. In order to maximize incident power, the unit
      almost touched the chamber's edge.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Temperature Measurements</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0109] To measure the temperature at various points within the
      chamber, an OMEGAETTE™ datalogger thermometer HH306 with compact
      transition ground-junction probe (TJC36 series) was used. This is
      a compact dual-input thermometer whose stainless steel-sheathed
      probe is small enough (250 µm) to fit within the EZ. Its range
      extends from -200 to 1370° C.±0.2% and resolution is 0.1° C. The
      datalogger can store up to 16,000 records at programmed intervals
      as short as once per second.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Results</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0110] A clue for the source of energy for EZ buildup came after
      having inadvertently left the experimental chamber on the
      microscope stage overnight. EZ size had diminished considerably;
      but after turning the microscope lamp on, EZ size began
      immediately to increase, restoring itself to the former size
      within minutes. With preliminary evidence that light could expand
      the EZ, we investigated systematically whether the energetic
      source for EZ buildup might indeed be radiant energy.<br>
      <br>
      [0111] Water is known to have a strong absorption peak at a
      wavelength 3.05 ~3.10 µm, corresponding to a symmetric OH stretch.
      Hence, the first used light source used was one with peak output
      at 3.1 µm, LED31-PR, which has full width at half maximum (FWHM)
      of 0.55 µm.<br>
      <br>
      [0112] Nafion tubing was suffused with a 1-µm
      carboxylate-microsphere suspension with a 1:500 volume fraction,
      to a depth of -1 mm. The chamber was made using a thin cover glass
      stuck to the bottom of a 1-mm thick cover slide with a 9-mm
      circular hole cut in the center, and was placed on the stage of
      the microscope. A pinhole was used to obtain an incident beam of
      restricted diameter. A fabricated holder integrated the pinhole
      and LED into a single unit with the LED mounted close to the
      pinhole. The LED-pinhole axis was vertically oriented.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Basic Observations</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0113] After the EZ had grown to a stable size, usually within 5
      minutes, the incident radiation was turned on. Optical power
      output was 33 µW, and the estimated power received through the
      pinhole was ~2.4 nW. After five minutes, the LED assembly was
      removed and the EZ was immediately photographed through the
      microscope. It was apparent that even with modest IR exposure, the
      EZ grew to approximately three times its control size.<br>
      <br>
      [0114] We also tracked the time course of EZ-width increase. This
      was carried out not only with the 3.1-µm source, but also with the
      2.0-µm and 1.75-µm sources (FWHM=0.16 µm and 0.18 µm,
      respectively). For the latter two sources, intensities were
      maintained at approximately 190 µW; but for the 3.1-µm source,
      power was kept at the maximally attainable value, 33 µW.<br>
      <br>
      [0115] During a 10 minute exposure at all three wavelengths, EZs
      continued to expand approximately linearly. The largest effect was
      seen at 3.1 µm, despite lower incident power. To determine whether
      the EZ continues to expand beyond the 10-min exposure, the 3.1-µm
      source was left on at the same intensity as above for up to one
      hour. The ratios increased from 3.7±0.10 (10 min) to 4.7±0.12 (30
      min) and to 6.1±0.17 (1 hr) respectively. Hence, the EZ continues
      to expand with continued exposure for up to at least one hour.
      Longer durations were deemed unreliable, as evaporation became
      noticeable; hence measurements were suspended.<br>
      <br>
      [0116] Post-illumination EZ-size dynamics were examined as well.
      When the infrared light was turned off after 5-minutes exposure,
      EZ width remained roughly constant with fluctuations for about 30
      min; then, it began decreasing noticeably, reaching halfway to
      baseline levels in typically ~15 minutes.<br>
      <br>
      [0117] To determine the effect of beam intensity on EZ expansion,
      the 2-µm source was employed at three power levels, 0.21, 0.34,
      and 1.20 mW. The rate of EZ expansion increased with an increase
      of incident power.<br>
      <br>
      [0118] EZ expansion is a function of both time and intensity.
      Hence, EZ growth depends on the cumulative amount of incident
      energy induced charge separation.<br>
      <br>
      [0119] To test whether the expansion might arise out of some
      unanticipated interaction between the incident radiation and the
      particular type of microsphere probe, microspheres of different
      size and composition were tested. For carboxylate microspheres of
      diameters 0.5 µm, 1 µm, 2 µm, and 4.5 µm at the same volume
      concentrations (1:500), mean expansion ratios for 5-min exposure
      of 3.1-µm radiation were: 2.41, 2.97, 3.08, and 3.34, respectively
      (n=6). For 1-µm microspheres made of carboxylate, sulfate, and
      silica under conditions the same as above, expansion ratios were
      2.97, 3.10 and 1.50 Hence, some material-based and size-based
      variations are noted—the latter arising possibly because of
      different numbers of particles per unit volume; but, appreciable
      radiation-induced expansion was nevertheless seen under all
      circumstances and with all materials. Hence, the existence of the
      light-induced expansion effect is not material specific.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Spatial Illumination Effects</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0120] We also explored the effect of illuminating with IR at
      different positions relative to the Nafion/water interface. For
      these measurements, a sheet of Nafion 117 film, approximately 6 mm
      long and 1.5 mm high, was held by a micro-clip and positioned in
      the vertical plane near the middle of the chamber. The chamber was
      made from a rectangular glass block, length 7 cm, width 2.5 cm and
      height 1.5 mm, with a rectangular hole, length 3.15 cm and width
      1.2 cm, cut through from top to bottom and a 1-mm-thick glass
      slide sealing from beneath. The film's upper edge was level with
      the solution surface. The vertical scale was carefully calibrated
      using a 1-mm-thick glass slide with face markings; one millimeter
      corresponded to 634 divisions on the focus knob. A 50-µm pinhole
      was placed immediately above the specimen in order to restrict
      incident spot size. To estimate spot diameter at different
      solution depths, a visible source (microscope light with green
      filter, ?=550 nm) was substituted for the LED. Beam diameters
      increased approximately linearly from 160 µm at the solution
      surface, to 240 µm at 1.5 mm below the surface. (These values are
      only approximate, as diameters will change with wavelength.) For
      observation and data-collection periods, which necessitated some
      illumination, intensity was minimized by use of this same filter.<br>
      <br>
      [0121] When the beam was first positioned in the middle of the EZ,
      we measured the expansion ratios at different depths. Maximum
      expansion occurred at a depth of approximately 450 µm from the
      solution surface, and was detectable well beyond 1 mm. The fact
      that the maximum expansion occurred well below the surface is
      unusual given the limited IR penetration ordinarily expected in
      water. One possibility is that penetration through the EZ is
      deeper than through bulk water: EZ-like zones are found at the
      air-water interface, and if IR radiation does penetrate more
      deeply through such zones, then the unexpectedly deep effects
      might be explainable. Indeed, changes in IR-absorption depth are
      noted in confined geometries, where interfacial, or EZ-like, water
      is abundant; hence, EZ water may have longer penetration depth
      than bulk water. Alternatively, the unexpectedly deep effects
      could arise indirectly: e.g., incident radiation creating ions,
      free radicals, or other highly reactive entities in the bulk,
      which are then free to diffuse in all directions, enhancing the
      downward EZ buildup.<br>
      <br>
      [0122] With the same setup as above, the spot was then positioned
      at varying distances from the Nafion-water interface. Expansion
      was largest when light was focused in the center of the EZ, and
      fell off on either side, although not appreciably. At deeper
      positions, the near-Nafion expansion peak tended to broaden
      somewhat, possibly because, of incident-beam broadening; but, the
      trend was essentially similar at all depths. The most notable
      finding is that even when the beam was positioned far from the
      Nafion surface, the expansion effect was appreciable.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Controls for Temperature</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0123] Infrared absorption in water causes a temperature
      elevation. Hence, we considered the possibility that the expansion
      might arise from an appreciable increase of chamber temperature.
      To measure local temperatures, an OMEGAETTE™ datalogger
      thermometer HH306 was used, with stainless-steel-sheathed, compact
      transition ground-junction probe (TJC36 series), small enough (250
      µm) to fit within the EZ. With the incident beam positioned to
      elicit the maximum expansion, i.e., centered 175 µm from the
      Nafion surface, the measured temperature increases are shown in
      Table 1. Radiation-induced temperature increases were modest at
      all positions and fairly uniform over the chamber. We also found
      little temperature variation with depth, implying that the thermal
      mass of the probe itself, immersed by varying extents for
      measurements at varying depths, did not introduce any serious
      artifact.<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>

      <br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp; 6 mm&nbsp; 0.92° C.<br>
      <br>
      [0124] Further to this point, we recorded the dynamics of
      temperature rise. The temperature increase occurred steadily,
      reaching a plateau of -1° C. at 10-15 min after turn-on. This
      plateau was attained at a time that the EZ continued to expand.
      Hence, not only was the temperature increase modest, but also the
      time course of temperature rise and EZ expansion were not
      correlated.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Spectral Analysis</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0125] A principal objective was to determine EZ-expansion's
      spectral sensitivity. The experimental setup was similar to that
      described above. The ~200-µm wide light beam emerging from the
      pinhole was directed to the middle of EZ, and expansion was
      measured 300 µm below solution surface. For the UV and visible
      sources, maintaining consistent optical power output at all
      wavelengths was achievable within +/-10% by adjusting the driver
      current. But IR sources were considerably weaker; hence output
      power was maintained at a lower level, three orders of magnitude
      lower than in the UV-visible ranges. Spectral results are
      therefore plotted separately.<br>
      <br>
      [0126] For UV and visible ranges all incident wavelengths brought
      appreciable expansion. The degree of expansion increased with
      increasing wavelength, the exception being the data point at 270
      nm, which was higher than the local minimum at 300 nm. The higher
      absorption may reflect the signature absorption peak at 270 nm
      characteristic of the EZ. Clear wavelength sensitivity was also
      found in the IR region, the most profound expansion occurring at
      3.1 µm. Recognizing that the optical power available for use in
      the IR region was 1/600 of that in the visible and UV regions, one
      can assume that with comparable power, the IR curve would shift
      considerably upward. Hence, the most profound effect is in the IR
      region, particularly at 3.1 µm.<br>
      <br>
      [0127] For building the EZ, incident IR must induce some change in
      bulk water, the most likely manifestation of which is molecular
      dissociation. It is already established that next to anionic
      surfaces the EZ is negatively charged. We observed evidence that
      negative charge buildup next to Nafion is associated with proton
      buildup in the bulk water beyond. Whereas the EZ is negatively
      charged, the region beyond the EZ appears to be positively
      charged. In other words, incident electromagnetic energy appears
      to split water into negative and positive moieties, creating
      potential energy.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Discussion</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0128] The most significant result of this study is that the
      near-surface exclusion zone expands extensively in the presence of
      radiant energy. That is, growth of this more ordered, negatively
      charged zone is dependent on incident electromagnetic energy.<br>
      <br>
      [0129] The overall spectral sensitivity of expansion follows
      closely the spectral sensitivity of water absorption. In both
      cases, there was an overall minimum in the near-UV, plus a local
      maximum at 2.0 µm, and a peak at 3.1 µm. If not by coincidence,
      then a connection is implied between IR absorption and EZ
      expansion—although the linkage is apparently not through
      temperature increase, which was both modest and temporally
      uncorrelated. Further to this point, increasing the bath
      temperature actually diminishes EZ size (unpublished
      observations). Hence, the effect of incident electromagnetic
      energy is apparently non-thermal.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Mechanistic Considerations</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0130] A question is how radiant energy could augment EZ size.
      This question rests on the more basic question of the energy
      responsible for the original EZ buildup, for buildup and
      augmentation may be driven from the same energetic source. Since
      infrared energy is consistently available under non-extreme
      conditions, IR energy is likely to be the agent responsible for
      both the initial buildup and the augmentation.<br>
      <br>
      [0131] To build the EZ, bulk water must undergo some kind of
      change. We found that as the negatively charged EZ builds, the
      concentration of protons in the region beyond the EZ likewise
      builds. Two independent techniques confirm this. Indeed,
      electrodes placed in the respective zones are able to deliver
      substantial current to a load, confirming genuine charge
      separation between the EZ and the bulk-water region beyond.<br>
      <br>
      [0132] Hence, it appears that the mechanism involves radiant
      energy-induced splitting of bulk water into negative and positive
      entities. The negative entity forms the ordered EZ, while the
      positive entity distributes itself broadly over the bulk. The
      negative-positive combination forms a battery-like entity, fueled
      by radiant energy.<br>
      <br>
      [0133] While the energy of an IR photon is generally considered
      too low to split water, some dissociation of water occurs even in
      the absence of external energy sources; i.e., the dissociation
      constant of water, Kw=[H+][OH—], underlies all pH measurement, and
      presumes that there is some dissociation even under ambient
      conditions. Incident IR would merely augment the naturally
      occurring dissociation. Once dissociated—either under natural IR
      exposure or augmented IR—the negative component would then go on
      to form the more ordered EZ. IR-induced ordering of water is not a
      new result; such ordering has been reported previously. Hence,
      there is precedent for this kind of IR-induced ordering.<br>
      <br>
      [0134] Classical thermodynamics prohibits splitting of water by IR
      because the energy required to break a partially covalent hydrogen
      bond is greater than energy of an IR photon. On the other hand,
      quantum considerations suggest that infrared radiation, between 3
      µm and 14 µm, has strong resonant effects on OH stretch, thereby
      resonantly raising the system's vibrational energy. Of those
      wavelengths, 3.1 µm, or wavenumber approximately 3200
      µcm&lt;-1&gt;, corresponds to the symmetric OH stretching of
      tetrahedrally coordinated, i.e., strongly hydrogen-bonded,
      “ice-like” water; hence, interfacial water has a more localized
      peak at 3200 cm&lt;-1 &gt;than does bulk water. Further, incident
      IR results in experimentally confirmed frequency-selective
      resonant photo-dissociation of the hydrogen-bond network.
      Apparently, such resonant irradiation induces multiphoton
      excitation of water molecules, which reorganizes the large
      hydrogen-bonded network into smaller ion-pair-state (H+ . . . OH—)
      water clusters with increased mobility. Thus, the IR-induced
      dissociation of water implied here has both precedent and physical
      rationale.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 2</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Experimental Methods</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0135] The experimental chamber was made of a 2-mm thick
      rectangular plastic block with a vertically oriented 1-cm diameter
      cylindrical hole cut in the middle. The bottom of the hole was
      sealed with a No. 1 glass microscope cover slip (150 µm thick),
      through which the sample could be observed. Prior to each
      experiment all surfaces were cleaned thoroughly with ethanol and
      de-ionized water.<br>
      <br>
      [0136] The suspensions under study consisted of three components:
      a single ion-exchange-resin bead (Bio-Rex MSZ 501(D) resin),
      microspheres, and distilled, de-ionized water. The
      ion-exchange-resin beads used were 600±100 µm in diameter and came
      in two types: anionic and cationic. Only one bead was used in each
      experiment, either positively charged or negatively charged. Prior
      to use, beads were washed with ethanol, and then washed again
      several times with de-ionized water from a Barnstead D3750
      Nanopure Diamond purification system (type I HPLC grade (18.2 MO)
      2 µm, polished).<br>
      <br>
      [0137] The microspheres used in this study were principally
      surfactant-free sulfate, white, polystyrene-latex, 2 µm in
      diameter (product number 1-2000, Interfacial Dynamics Corporation,
      Portland, Oreg.). Particles of this size undergo vigorous Brownian
      motion in water, and are sufficiently large to be imaged with a
      conventional light microscope. The microspheres are synthesized
      with a large number of sulfate groups chemically bound to their
      surfaces. These groups dissociate in water, each having a single
      negative charge bound to the microsphere surface and giving a
      compensating positively charged counter ion in solution.
      Therefore, the sulfate microspheres used in experiments were
      negatively charged.<br>
      <br>
      [0138] All experiments were conducted on a Melles Griot isolation
      bench to shield against ambient vibration.<br>
      <br>
      [0139] We pursued three categories of experiment: (i) one
      positively charged bead and negatively charged microspheres; (ii)
      one negatively charged bead and negatively charged microspheres;
      (iii) controls. For each experiment, a single bead was first
      placed in the chamber. Then, an aqueous microsphere suspension
      with a volume fraction of approximately 0.08 was added. Once the
      bead settled firmly to the bottom, the chamber was sealed
      carefully with a No. 1 microscope cover slip and put on the sample
      stage of an inverted Zeiss Axiovert-35 optical microscope, used in
      the bright-field mode with either a 10×, 5×, or 2.5× objective
      lens depending on the goal of the particular experiment. An
      attached color digital camera (Scion Corporation, CFW-1310C) was
      used to record images and videos. Track* Version 1.0 (© 2001 Penn
      State University) was used to track the trajectories and
      coordinates of the microspheres. Radial velocity was then
      calculated as a function of distance from the bead surface, and
      the results were plotted.<br>
      <br>
      [0140] In the controls, different negatively charged microspheres
      (2 µm carboxylate, Polysciences, Inc. Cat #18327) were used to
      test if the attraction might be the consequence of the specific
      surface-functional group that was ordinarily used. As another
      control, we replaced the ion-exchange bead with another charged
      surface, Nafion, to test whether unanticipated ion-exchange action
      might have caused the attraction. Nafion-117 is composed of a
      carbon-fluorine backbone with perfluoro side chains containing
      sulfonic acid groups, fabricated from a copolymer of
      tetrafluoroethylene and perfluorinated monomers. A 600-µm diameter
      Nafion grain was used in place of the bead. Third, extremely
      diluted concentrations of microspheres were used to determine
      whether the long-range attraction still exists when
      microsphere-microsphere distance increases sufficiently. We
      employed the lowest practical concentration (1/200 normal)—one
      that just barely allowed the required measurements to be made.
      Finally, some of the experiments were repeated in a chamber made
      solely from polycarbonate to rule out artifacts due to glass
      surfaces at top and bottom.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Results</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Positively Charged Bead and Negatively Charged Microspheres</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0141] For these experiments, one positively charged bead was
      placed in a solution of negatively charged microspheres (see FIG.
      10). Immediately after the chamber was placed on the microscope
      stage, microspheres were observed to be moving toward the bead
      surface from all directions. These movements continued for up to
      three hours. The motion occurred throughout the chamber towards
      the bead from all directions, as illustrated by the arrows in FIG.
      10. At distances of 200 µm from the bead surface, microspheres
      moved consistently toward the bead at a speed of about 1 µm/s.<br>
      <br>
      [0142] Attractive movements were found even at distances of up to
      2 mm from the bead surface (FIG. 11). Data points obtained from
      four orthogonal directions were assembled into a single figure for
      comparison. All data were recorded just after the microsphere
      suspension had been added to the chamber. The resulting
      velocity-vs.-distance trends are similar in all four curves. At
      distances farther than 400 µm from the bead surface, velocity
      remained invariant at a value of ~0.3 µm/s. At positions closer
      than ~200 µm, velocity began to noticeably increase approximately
      exponentially, up to a value of ~5 µm/s at the bead surface,
      implying a distance-dependent attractive force. On the other hand,
      the fact that microspheres still moved toward the bead at
      distances of 2,000 µm or farther implies that attractive
      interactions extend over an extremely long range.<br>
      <br>
      [0143] With increasing time, microspheres accumulated
      progressively at the surface of the bead, and after one hour, a
      bead-surface cluster could be readily detected (FIGS. 12A-12C).
      FIG. 12A is the image of the bead surface at the start of the
      experiment. In FIG. 12B, taken after one hour, the bead surface
      appears darker because more microspheres had deposited. In order
      to examine more details of microsphere deposition on the bead
      surface, smaller microspheres (D: 0.47 µm) were substituted for
      the 2-µm spheres ordinarily used. The surface structure could then
      be seen as a colloidal crystal (see FIG. 12C). Possibly, an
      element of crystallinity was present with the larger microspheres
      as well, but less conspicuous because of irregularities in layered
      structure and the presence of fewer layers.<br>
      <br>
      [0144] Microsphere movements were tracked in several different
      focal planes, above, below, or the same as, the bead's equatorial
      plane. Irrespective of the plane, microspheres behaved
      similarly—moving toward the bead and moving faster when within 200
      µm of the bead surface. Eventually, all microspheres settled on
      the bead surface.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Negatively Charged Bead and Negatively Charged Microspheres</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0145] For these experiments one negatively charged bead was used
      in conjunction with negatively charged microspheres. In contrast
      to the former setup with the positively charged bead, the
      negatively charged bead was ultimately surrounded by a clear
      “exclusion zone” devoid of microspheres (FIG. 13). Such exclusion
      zones have been reported in detail in earlier work. The exclusion
      zone first grew with time, and finally became stable after
      approximately 10 minutes. It extended roughly 300 µm from the bead
      surface, similar to previous observations.<br>
      <br>
      [0146] During the formation of the exclusion zone, microspheres
      were progressively excluded from the vicinity of the bead,
      translocating to positions beyond the exclusion zone. Once the
      exclusion zone was fully established, microspheres became
      attracted to its far edge from all directions, as illustrated by
      the arrows in FIG. 13. Such attraction is unexpected, as
      microspheres and bead have the same (negative) charge polarity.<br>
      <br>
      [0147] The dependence of velocity on distance from the
      exclusion-zone edge is shown in FIG. 14. Positive values of
      velocity imply attraction between negatively charged microspheres
      and negatively charged bead surface. The figure confirms that
      microspheres were attracted towards the bead from every direction,
      and from distances as large as 2 mm from the edge of the exclusion
      zone. The velocities were lower than in the case with positively
      charged bead, and remained at more or less the same value of -0.3
      µm/s throughout the effective range of up to 2 mm from the
      exclusion-zone edge (with some diminution close to the
      exclusion-zone edge; see Discussion), indicating the presence of a
      long-range attractive force in the direction of the bead, even
      though the bead and microspheres are of the same charge polarity.<br>
      <br>
      [0148] Upon examining different focus planes, we found that as
      microspheres moved closer to the bead, they also moved toward the
      lower focal plane. Most of them accumulated on the glass surface
      at the bottom of the chamber, near the point where the bead
      touched the floor of the chamber. Immediately above the chamber
      floor and near to the bead, some microspheres translated away from
      the bead as others from above moved toward the bead, as though
      there were some minor circulation within a zone of about 150 µm.
      For the most part, however, microspheres progressively accumulated
      at the bottom, near the bead.<br>
      <br>
      [0149] The pictorial time course of accumulation is shown in FIG.
      15 with a negatively charged bead sitting at the bottom of the
      chamber. The pictures were taken at a focal plane lower than
      bead's equatorial plane. The region of sediment around the bottom
      of the bead grew with time, as can be seen by the progressive
      growth of the white area. Furthermore, after 24 hours, the
      suspension itself appeared much clearer, indicating fewer
      microspheres remaining in suspension—most of them having already
      settled at the bottom near the negatively charged bead.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Controls</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0150] We substituted carboxylate microspheres in order to rule
      out the possibility that the attraction was related to some
      specific feature of the sulfate microspheres used regularly. The
      results were similar. The negatively charged carboxylate
      microspheres were attracted to the negatively charged bead in all
      planes out to a distance of more than 2 mm from the exclusion-zone
      edge. Likewise, attraction to the positively charged bead took
      place at a velocity of 0.3 µm/s when microspheres were farther
      than 400 µm from the bead surface; and, beginning at a distance of
      ~200 µm from the bead surface velocity increased exponentially to
      a terminal value of 4 µm per second at the bead surface. Hence, in
      terms of the long-range attraction to both positively and
      negatively charged beads, carboxylate microspheres behaved in the
      same way as sulfate microspheres.<br>
      <br>
      [0151] We also checked the bead. In order to test for some
      unanticipated ion-exchange effect of the particular bead material,
      we substituted a grain of Nafion. Similar to the negatively
      charged bead, the grain of Nafion also developed an exclusion
      zone, which grew to 300 µm within 20 min. Measured just after that
      time, microspheres translated towards the edge of the exclusion
      zone at a velocity of ~0.3 µm/s, quantitatively similar to the
      behavior observed with the negatively charged bead. Hence, the
      nature of the “attractor” material seemed to play no decisive
      role.<br>
      <br>
      [0152] Experiments were also carried out using a reduced
      concentration of microspheres to see whether long-range attraction
      still exists when the separation of microspheres is very much
      increased. At the lowest practical concentration (1/200 normal),
      the mean distance between adjacent microspheres was ~200 µm.
      Surprisingly, long-range attractive behavior persisted. FIGS. 16A
      and 16B show representative curves of distance vs. velocity
      respectively around positively and negatively charged beads with
      reduced microsphere concentration. Positive values of velocity
      indicate attraction. In both cases, microspheres move toward the
      bead throughout the 2-mm range. The shapes of these curves are
      similar to those in FIGS. 11 and 13, respectively, although the
      velocities are lower and there is considerable scatter. Despite
      such extreme distances between microspheres, long-range attraction
      was still evident.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 3</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Methods</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0153] A length of 3-mm diameter Nafion tubing (PermaPure TT-110,
      Toms River N.J.) ~7 cm long was placed in a plastic chamber 4.5 cm
      wide, 1.8 cm long, and 6.4 mm deep. The tube laid horizontally in
      the reservoir, protruding through each of two holes drilled in
      opposite sides of the chamber wall. Hole diameter was carefully
      chosen to hold the tube securely but not allow water to escape.<br>
      <br>
      [0154] A solution of distilled, deionized water (resistivity of
      18.2 MO-cm, Barnstead Accu-Dispense) and 2 µm carboxylate
      microspheres (Polysciences Inc, Warrington Pa.) was prepared using
      a ratio of 1 drop of microsphere suspension per 15 mL of water.
      The resulting suspension was mixed until it appeared homogeneous.
      The Nafion tube was placed into the empty reservoir, with ends
      protruding through the holes. The solution was then poured to fill
      the reservoir to a level 1.3 mm above the tube, and a syringe was
      used to fill the inside of the tube, whose ends were both left
      open to the air. Both the reservoir and tube were filled from the
      same microsphere suspension. The reservoir/Nafion-tube system was
      then set aside for 10-15 minutes to allow the EZ to develop.<br>
      <br>
      [0155] For puncturing the tube, a tapered needle was made using a
      5-mL, 1.1-mm outer-diameter glass pipette (VWR, West Chester Pa.)
      and a vertical pipette puller (David Kopf Instruments, Tujunga
      Calif.). This device heats the glass while pulling apart both
      ends, resulting in two very fine tapered glass needles ( ~0.05 mm
      diameter at the tip). One of these needles was placed in a
      micro-manipulator that allowed for fine motion along all axes, and
      which facilitated the hole puncturing.<br>
      <br>
      [0156] After the tube had been immersed in the suspension for
      10-15 minutes, a hole was created midway along the length of tube
      by pushing the needle through the side of the tube wall until it
      created a hole ~0.2 mm in diameter. The needle was then slowly
      retracted, taking care to avoid disturbing the Nafion tube unduly,
      and leaving the hole open for water to pass through.<br>
      <br>
      [0157] Water flow was observed by tracking the suspended
      microspheres under an inverted microscope (Nikon Diaphot, with
      Zeiss CP-Achromat magnifier and Leica DFL-290 camera) with 5×
      objective. We confirmed that liquid was indeed flowing into the
      tube by observing the continuous movement of the meniscus inside
      the tube. As the suspension had a relatively uniform microsphere
      density, the number of microspheres seen passing through the hole
      from the reservoir into the tube should be directly proportional
      to the flow volume, which would otherwise be difficult to measure
      accurately.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Results</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0158] The initial result was the visual observation of a clear
      and consistent flow of water from the outside of the tube, through
      the hole, to the inside of the tube. This is shown in FIGS. 16A
      and 16B. The figures shown are representative of ten experiments
      each carried out identically as described above.<br>
      <br>
      [0159] By tracking the inward motion of microspheres through the
      hole, it was possible to monitor the rate of flow over time.
      Inward flow started out strong but dropped off to a constant
      non-zero value after tens of minutes (see FIG. 17). The plateau
      values varied from experiment to experiment, depending mainly on
      hole diameter; but mean values obtained from ten experiments were
      5.7+/-2.7 microspheres per second.<br>
      <br>
      [0160] To test the possibility that only the microspheres, but not
      the microsphere suspension, were passing through the hole, we
      examined the menisci position inside the tube as a function of
      time. There was a clear shift in the menisci at both ends of the
      tube starting immediately after the hole was opened, indicating
      that the fluid was indeed flowing through the hole rather than the
      microspheres alone. Additionally, the shape of the menisci changed
      from concave initially to flat while fluid was flowing; this
      implied that it was indeed the fluid's pressure that was pushing
      the menisci outward.<br>
      <br>
      [0161] To test whether the underlying mechanism involved local
      effects only, we created a second hole ~1 cm from the first. This
      was done approximately one hour after the first hole was punched.
      We found that the flows were coupled; i.e., just as the second
      hole was punched, flow through the first hole abruptly diminished
      (FIG. 18). Meanwhile, flow through the second hole exceeded the
      pre-puncture flow through the first hole. Both flows continued to
      decrease with time. This coupling implied that the flow was
      dependent both on local properties and characteristics of the tube
      system in general.<br>
      <br>
      [0162] To determine whether EZ size might play a role in
      determining flow, we tracked inner and outer EZ sizes as a
      function of time, along with flow rate (FIGS. 19A and 19B). Outer
      EZ showed little variation with time; however, inner EZ did vary
      substantially over time: as inner EZ size shrank, flow diminished
      concomitantly. Representative data are shown in FIGS. 19A and 19B.<br>
      <br>
      [0163] To test further for EZ involvement in the phenomenon, a
      control experiment was carried out using a Tygon tube
      (Cole-Parmer, Vernon Hills Ill.) which exhibits no EZ. The same
      procedures were followed as described above, using a tube of
      similar size and diameter. The needle produced a hole in the tube,
      but no flow was observed. From these observations and those of
      FIG. 19A and FIG. 19B we could draw two conclusions: First, the
      exclusion zone is likely to be a relevant factor for the presence
      of flow. And second, that gravity-related hydrostatic pressure is
      not a critical factor, as the depth of the silicon tube was the
      same as the Nafion tube.<br>
      <br>
      [0164] In order to explore further the role of the EZ in this
      flow, we studied whether flow dynamics might be impacted by
      induced changes in EZ size. Earlier research had shown the EZ to
      be negatively charged. Hence, by adding H&lt;+&gt; in the form of
      an acid, charge neutralization could reduce EZ size; or, by adding
      OH&lt;-&gt; in a base the increased negative charge could enhance
      EZ size. This expectation proved accurate, and it was thus
      possible to test the effects of EZ size on flow rate. These tests
      involved creating acidic or basic suspensions, which were then
      substituted for the aqueous suspensions inside or outside the
      tube, giving four different conditions.<br>
      <br>
      [0165] With a 0.01M NaOH-containing microsphere suspension
      introduced into the Nafion tube instead of the control suspension,
      the inside EZ expanded from ~0.2 to ~0.5 mm. When punctured, the
      inward flow was considerably greater than the control. Instead of
      dropping to a rate of 4-5 microspheres/second, the flow leveled
      off at 20-25 microspheres/second (FIG. 17). Hence, increased
      inside EZ was associated with increased flow.<br>
      <br>
      [0166] With HCl of the same concentration inside the tube, the
      inside EZ became almost zero, compared to ~0.2 mm for the control.
      The flow began inward as usual, then dropped to zero at the 5
      minute mark, and then reversed direction. The outward flow
      increased over the next half hour, reaching a maximum outward flow
      rate of 10 microspheres/sec before diminishing to a slower rate
      (FIG. 21). Similar patterns were seen in each of six experiments,
      although the dynamics differed slightly.<br>
      <br>
      [0167] Acidic and basic solutions were also placed outside of the
      tube rather than inside. With acid outside the tube, the flow
      behaved similarly to the NaOH-inside results: inward flow was much
      higher than the control and remained at a higher steady rate
      relative to controls after 30-40 minutes. Significant
      complications were encountered when using NaOH outside the tube.
      Once the inward flow started, the microspheres began clumping
      together and precipitating out of the suspension. As a result, no
      significant data were obtainable for NaOH outside the tube.<br>
      <br>
      [0168] For all of these four pH tests, we also tracked inside EZ
      size, as done with the original tests described above. Inside EZ
      consistently decreased with time, as with controls. From these
      observations we began formulating a hypothesis that could account
      for all of these results and observations, which we discuss below.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Discussion</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0169] An unexpected flow pattern was explored in these
      experiments, apparently related to the presence of a so-called
      exclusion zone. When a Nafion tube was immersed in water and a
      hole was punched in the tube wall, the water flowed continuously
      from the outside to the inside of the tube. Although the flow rate
      diminished with time, it reached a plateau that persisted for at
      least the full period of observation, which typically exceeded one
      hour. Hence, the flow was persistent. And, it was observable in
      every one of the approximately 40 experiments carried out.<br>
      <br>
      [0170] Control experiments demonstrated that the flow was not the
      result of some kind of hydrostatic pressure differential, but was
      specific to some feature of the Nafion tubing. When silicon tubing
      of the same dimension was substituted, no flow was seen. One
      prominent feature of Nafion is the presence of large exclusion
      zones, or EZs adjacent to its surface (Zheng and Pollack, 2003;
      Zheng et al., 2006). Silicon tubing is hydrophobic, and shows no
      such zones. Hence, it appeared that some feature of Nafion's
      EZ-generating capacity of the Nafion might be responsible for
      inducing this flow.<br>
      <br>
      [0171] We confirmed that flow rate depended on the size of the
      annular EZ inside the tubing. Increasing EZ size by adding base
      within the tubing increased flow magnitude, while diminishing
      inside EZ size by adding acid inside diminished the flow. We also
      found that dynamic changes of EZ size correlated with dynamic
      changes of flow. Hence, the evidence implied that some aspect of
      inside-EZ size might be responsible for driving the flow.<br>
      <br>
      [0172] The driving mechanism may involve charge separation. The EZ
      is negatively charged, while the region beyond is positively
      charged as a result of proton release. The protons would be
      expected to combine immediately with water, creating hydronium
      ions, i.e., positively charged water. Hence, a possibility to
      explain the flow is that the positively charged water molecules
      are attracted by the negative potential of the inside exclusion
      zone. Once the tube is punctured, the positively charged water
      directly adjacent to the puncture will be strongly drawn toward
      the interior negativity. The farther-away molecules outside the
      tube are then drawn to the space previously held by the original
      molecules. Moving closer, these molecules will in turn feel the
      strong pull of the interior negativity, and will be drawn with
      equal vigor into the tube. Thus, the flow persists.<br>
      <br>
      [0173] Additional mechanisms would contribute to the temporal
      decline in flow rate. The influx of protons into the tube
      effectively neutralizes the negatively charged EZ, diminishing
      internal EZ size. The decrease in EZ size in turn decreases the
      electrodynamic force exerted on the water molecules, which in turn
      leads to a lower flow rate. This negative feedback cycle would
      lead to exponential flow patterns similar to those described
      above.<br>
      <br>
      [0174] While this mechanism seems consistent with observations,
      additional experiments will be required to test its detailed
      features and predictions. The main purpose here is to report this
      unexpected but consistent flow, and to speculate on the possible
      driving force. Other driving mechanisms may be possible, but the
      consistent correlation between EZ size and flow rate makes the
      present one attractive at least as a starting point.<br>
      <br>
      [0175] Implicit in this persisting flow is some source of
      persisting driving energy, for baseline flow persists without
      apparent diminution for extended lengths of time, well beyond one
      hour. If it is the mechanism above that bears responsibility, then
      a likely source of energy is incident radiant energy, for EZ
      buildup is fueled by radiant energy, particularly in the infrared
      region. Hence, infrared energy might be the ultimate driving
      source for this persisting and counter-intuitive flow.<br>

      A polar liquid mixture containing suspended or dissolved particles
      or solute is exposed to air or a hydrophilic surface. An exclusion
      zone having a reduced concentration of particles or solute is
      formed in the polar liquid adjacent to the interface with air or
      the hydrophilic surface. One or more fractions of purified polar
      liquid and/or concentrated particles or solute are collected. A
      sensor can provide feedback to the collector.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0002] Systems and methods are described for separating and/or
      collecting fractions of fluids including components of mixtures,
      suspensions, and solutions in polar liquids. In one embodiment, an
      apparatus flows an aqueous mixture over a hydrophilic surface to
      form a first region of purified water and a second region of at
      least one concentrated non-aqueous component. The apparatus can
      draw off either the purified water or the concentrated non-aqueous
      components. In one embodiment, an array of tubules performs the
      differential extraction. In another embodiment, various
      hydrophilic and/or hydrophobic surfaces are disposed in multiple
      differential extractors and some effluents may be recycled to
      perform complex assaying and separation. In another embodiment an
      apparatus can draw off purified water just beneath an air-water
      interface.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] According to an embodiment, an apparatus for collecting a
      fraction of a mixture, suspension, or solution of a polar liquid
      includes a first collector configured to collect a fraction of a
      mixture, suspension, or solution of a polar liquid at a selected
      distance at or away from an interface between the polar liquid and
      air or a hydrophilic surface; and a structure configured to hold
      the first collector at the selected distance. A first fraction
      collected from a first region at a first proximate distance at or
      away from the interface includes substantially pure polar liquid.
      A second fraction collected at a second distal distance away from
      the interface in the second region includes a an increased
      concentration of a solute or particle component compared to the
      first fraction.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] According to another embodiment, a method for collecting a
      fraction of a polar liquid mixture, suspension, or solution
      includes receiving, establishing, or accessing a volume of a polar
      liquid mixture, suspension, or solution; allowing an exclusion
      zone to form adjacent to an interface between the polar liquid
      mixture, suspension, or solution and air or a hydrophilic surface;
      and collecting a fraction of the polar liquid mixture, suspension,
      or solution at or at a selected distance from the air or
      hydrophilic surface.<br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Overview</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0021] Embodiments according to this disclosure describe methods
      and apparatuses for collecting fractions of mixtures, suspensions,
      and solutions of polar liquids. For example, the polar liquid can
      consist essentially of water. Other polar liquids that form an
      exclusion zone adjacent to an interface with a hydrophilic surface
      or air may behave similarly and have fractions of mixtures,
      suspensions, or solutions collected.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] Illustrative examples relating to the collection of
      fractions from water are described as embodiments herein, but
      similar apparatuses and methods may be made and performed using
      similar approaches with other polar fluids. The term “aqueous
      mixture” will be used herein to represent an illustrative aqueous
      mixture, suspension, or solution. To collect fractions, the
      aqueous mixture is exposed to a hydrophilic surface, such as the
      inside of tubes made of hydrophilic materials. A region
      corresponding to a “purified water” fraction forms near the
      hydrophilic surface in which one or more solutes or other
      non-aqueous components are partially or entirely excluded. Hence,
      the hydrophilic surface is also referred to herein as an
      “exclusion surface.” Likewise, a region corresponding to a
      “concentrated solute” fraction forms “away from” the exclusion
      surface. Thus, the gradient caused by the exclusion surface can be
      exploited to obtain fractions of water such as purified water or a
      concentrated phase of a non-aqueous component.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] Such aqueous mixtures include salt solutions, colloids,
      suspensions, waste water, bodily fluids, mining tailings, etc.,
      that is, most any combination of water and another compound or
      substance. Non-aqueous components of an aqueous mixture can
      include organic and inorganic salts, biomatter, pathogens,
      bacteria etc., and many other solids and semi-solids. For example,
      the exemplary techniques to be described herein can separate
      microspheres that are similar in size to bacteria to easily obtain
      a 20:1 separation.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] In one implementation, an exemplary method removes salts
      from water to obtain efficient desalination. The salts to be
      separated can include sodium chloride, seawater salts, components
      of buffer solutions, and many other salts and ionic compounds.
      Hence, exemplary methods can separate ionic (charged) components
      from water mixtures, or can separate neutral, non-ionic species
      from water mixtures too.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] From another perspective, the subject matter to be
      described can concentrate dissolved or suspended species from
      aqueous solutions. That is, instead of pure water being the only
      desired product, an exemplary method can be used to concentrate
      the non-aqueous components of an aqueous mixture. This can be
      useful in many manufacturing processes and in the clinical lab,
      e.g., for diagnosing medical conditions via blood work and other
      physiological tests that involve bodily or cellular fluids. The
      exemplary methods described herein can be used to separate and/or
      concentrate salts, pathogens, contaminants, dyes, organic and
      inorganic species, etc., from aqueous mixtures. Solute size can be
      as small as a few nanometers (e.g., molecular weight of
      approximately 300).<br>
      <br>
      [0026] In one implementation, multiple separation stages are
      performed in series, including, for example, a cascade of multiple
      similar stages iterated to amplify the effect, as well as
      variegated stages for different materials. Thus, process flow may
      follow a tree structure or flow diagram analogous to complex
      stages of a chemical synthesis or purification, in which different
      components are separated or concentrated at different times and in
      different quantities by different implementations or instances of
      the exemplary exclusion surface. The succession of stages allows
      an exemplary process to exclude more types of solutes from an
      increasingly purer aqueous mixture. The succession can also
      improve the purification of a single material, e.g., to
      automatically obtain a super pure product in the lab. Moreover, a
      user can specify which non-aqueous species are to be separated out
      or concentrated from an aqueous mixture.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Exemplary Process</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0027] We found that many solutes were excluded from a region
      adjacent to hydrophilic surfaces. Included among the excluded
      species were microspheres of various size, erythrocytes, proteins,
      and even small molecular weight dyes. Salts also appeared to be
      excluded. The exclusion zone varied in size, but in one
      implementation was several hundred micrometers wide. Given the
      large size of this zone, and the exclusion of many solutes, we
      discovered that the exclusion zone contained “pure” water, which
      could then be harvested. The formation of the exclusion zone was
      similar to the formation of ice—which crystallizes to the
      exclusion of foreign materials in its molecular structure.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] In general, negatively charged surfaces exclude negatively
      charged solutes, and positively charged surfaces exclude
      positively charged solutes. So, for many different solutes, a
      surface can be selected that will exclude solutes from a region of
      pure or purer water. Bacteria, viruses, etc., fall into size and
      charge domains as solutes that we typically tested, so these too
      can be excluded from the region of purified water. Biological
      specimens, such as red blood cells, were also excluded from this
      region. It is worth noting that negatively charged surfaces do, in
      general, exclude negatively charged solutes; however, some
      positively charged solutes are excluded as well. Similarly,
      positively charged surfaces generally exclude positively charged
      solutes, but also some negatively charged solutes as well.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0000] Flow Profile measurements</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0029] An initial issue to be tested was whether the water in such
      an exclusion zone near a surface was or was not bound to the
      nucleating surface (i.e., a gel, polymer, or other exclusion
      surface). If the water adhered tightly, then removal would not be
      easily possible. To pursue this question we used polyacrylic acid
      gels, with characteristic dimensions of several centimeters,
      containing a 2-mm channel. Because the gel was clear, the channel
      could be visualized using an optical microscope. Microsphere
      suspensions were forced through the channel under pressure. At the
      entryway, microspheres were uniformly distributed across the cross
      section. Farther along the channel, an exclusion zone developed:
      the annulus was clear, while the core region contained
      concentrated spheres. Still farther along, the clear annulus grew
      at the expense of the core, and ultimately, after several
      centimeters, the relative dimensions of annulus and core no longer
      changed.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] To assess whether annular water adhered to the gel surface,
      we measured volume flow at intervals of several millimeters along
      the channel. The profile could be measured only in the core, where
      microspheres were present, and not in the annulus, where there
      were no markers. Thus, the complete profile could be measured near
      the entryway, while only partial profiles could be measured
      farther along. Each profile was integrated to give volume flow.
      Thus, we could obtain volume flows in the microsphere-containing
      zones at intervals along the channel. If the integrated flows were
      equal at all points, then we would have concluded that the annular
      regions were adherent; only the microsphere-containing regions
      flowed. By contrast, we found that the integrated profiles
      diminished significantly with distance along the channel. This
      meant that volume flow in the microsphere zones decreased
      progressively along the channel. Or, in other words, some of the
      flow had to come from the clear annulus. We established that the
      annular region did, indeed, flow (at least in part), making
      possible the exemplary techniques.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Apparatus for Solute Separation</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0031] As shown in FIG. 1, an exemplary “differential extractor”
      100 separates a solution into concentrated and dilute (clear)
      fractions. The principle of the extraction is also illustrated in
      FIG. 1. A homogenous microsphere suspension 102 enters a NAFION
      tube 104 at one end (DuPont Corporation, Wilmington, Del.). NAFION
      is a Teflon-like polymer with exposed sulfonate groups, used in
      fuel cells, actuators, and other applications. In one
      implementation, NAFION was found to be an ideal exclusion surface
      and will be referred to herein as a representative material for
      the exemplary exclusion surface, although other materials can also
      be used for the exclusion surface. As the solution travels through
      the NAFION tube 104, the microspheres 102 migrate from the walls
      106 of the tube 104 and gather in the core region 108. Clear water
      from the exclusion zone 110 and microsphere-containing water 112
      pass through different channels of the extractor 100, and are then
      collected. In one implementation, the differential extractor 100
      is used to extract clear water.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] In FIG. 2, the dimensions of one implementation of the
      exemplary differential extractor 100 are given. An elevation view
      202 shows the two different channels that draw off the
      concentrated and diluted products of the separation. Of course,
      either the concentrated or diluted products of the extractor 100
      can be subjected to subsequent instances of the extractor 100 to
      provide further concentration or dilution of the particular
      product. The concentration branch or the dilution branch of the
      extractor 100 can even be looped back to the input of the NAFION
      tube to recycle the particular product multiple times through the
      same extractor 100.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] Another implementation of an extraction schema is shown in
      FIG. 3. Pump “1” 302 and Pump “2” 304 reduce the pressure in the
      peripheral channel and the center channel, respectively, to
      facilitate collection. Pressure reduction in the channels results
      in inflow of solution into the channels with linear velocity
      proportional to the negative pressure generated by each pump. The
      negative pressures can be adjusted so that the linear velocity is
      equal in both channels. The concentrated and dilute solutions can
      be collected in different syringes. Importantly, in this
      implementation, the tube 104 itself can be immersed in the, e.g.,
      microsphere 102 (or salt) solution. Hence, the initial
      concentration in the solution outside the tube 104 is the same as
      that of the solution inside.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] Three differential extractors 100 are described as
      examples. In one implementation, the extractor 100 is constructed
      with glue. Brass bushings are used for maintaining tube
      concentricity. The proximal end of the extractor 100 is initially
      flush. This implementation shows that the exemplary extractor 100
      can be made of diverse materials, as long as they are impervious
      to the components being separated.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] In another implementation, the extractor 100 can be
      constructed from stainless steel tubing, and overall lengths can
      be increased to accommodate some different features. In this case,
      the extractor 100 incorporates an extension sleeve on the outer
      tubing to increase extraction efficiency.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] In yet another implementation, the differential extractor
      100 has larger diameter stainless steel tubing to accommodate a
      relatively larger NAFION tubing 104 that, especially effective for
      some applications. For example, construction can be carried out
      with low temperature silver solder, and concentricity can be
      maintained by dimpling the outer tube. The distance between inner
      and outer tube, the annulus, can be approximately 0.1 mm. Also,
      the central tube, used to collect highly concentrated
      microspheres, can be extended out 0.5 mm at the proximal end. This
      makes it possible to visualize the extraction process
      microscopically. This, in turn, may allow flows to be regulated in
      a sensitive manner to match the relative size of the exclusion
      zones. In one implementation, the smaller the exclusion zone 110,
      the larger should be the difference of flow in order to achieve
      good separation. Given the availability of a sensitive manner of
      adjusting flows, 10-20 times concentration difference can be
      obtained (e.g., see images in FIG. 1).<br>
      <br>
      [0037] The particular geometry and materials employed in the
      exemplary extractor 100 can be varied to improve results for a
      particular application. For instance, a polyacrylic-acid gel may
      also be used as the exclusion surface.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] In one implementation, particles in the micron-size range
      can be separated out of water using the exemplary techniques.
      Depending on refinement of the implementation, the extractor 100
      may achieve a 10:1 or 20:1 concentration difference ratio between
      purified water and microsphere enriched output. With multiple
      extraction stages in series, e.g., using different extraction
      surfaces, superb separation ratios are achievable. Separating
      (micron-sized) pathogens is therefore possible.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Spectrophotometric Studies</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0039] In one implementation, relatively slow flow in the NAFION
      tube is maintained in order to prevent turbulence, which increases
      reliability and may be used in circumstances in which the speed of
      extraction is of secondary importance. For example, in a model
      implementation, 100 ml of concentrated and 10 ml of dilute
      solution were collected over 10-12 hours.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] An exemplary method was adopted to detect even small
      differences in concentration. We found that spectrophotometer
      readings gave the first sign of successful separation, albeit
      sometimes they were very small. After two fractions were
      collected, absorption spectra were obtained for concentrated and
      dilute species using a UV-VIS spectrometer. Examples of absorption
      curves are shown in FIG. 4, where the upper curve corresponds to
      the concentrated fraction and the lower curve corresponds to the
      purified fraction. The result corresponds to one implementation,
      in which the separation ratio was relatively low, approximately
      1:2 or 1:3. Early development of the separation principle also
      showed that the spectrophotometric method could be used as a
      sensitive detector of even subtle differences between fractions.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Microsphere Counting</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0041] After the spectrophotometric approach for detecting a
      concentration gradient was pursued, an initial gel implementation
      was replaced by the NAFION tubing described above, and improved
      extractors were thereby developed. As development of exemplary
      methods progressed, the concentration difference between fractions
      grew sufficiently large, up to 20:1, that it could be seen by the
      naked eye, or measured accurately by use of a microscope.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] Thin layers of the concentrated and dilute fractions were
      therefore created and viewed with a microscope. Since the
      microscope has a finite depth of field, direct counting of
      microspheres in the field gives the number within some fixed
      volume, i.e., the concentration. By comparing the number of the
      microspheres in the respective fractions, the concentration
      difference could be ascertained. In one phase of development,
      approximately ten experiments were carried out. The layers of
      solution were of the same thickness, ca. 0.1 mm. The area was 1-2
      square cm.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] One result obtained using this approach showed a separation
      of between approximately 10:1 to 20:1. However, in this
      implementation the ratio was strongly dependent on the desired
      collection rate. If water from the outer annulus was drawn very
      slowly, we estimate that, practically, it will be possible to
      obtain separation coefficients of 100:1 or even higher—mainly
      because the exclusion zone never contains microspheres, even when
      the microsphere concentration is raised to high values.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Further Experimental Details</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0044] Initial microsphere concentration was 2.84×10 exp6
      particles/ml in most experiments during development. In the
      photographs presented, the initial solution concentration was
      1.13×10 exp7 particles/ml. POLYBEAD Carboxylate 2.0 µm
      microspheres were used and were diluted in distilled water
      (Polysciences, Inc., Warrington, Pa.).<br>
      <br>
      [0045] The extraction speed, i.e., the volume flow inside the
      NAFION tube, was 1 ml/hour if the experiment was conducted
      overnight or 4-5 ml/hour during the daytime. With this speed, we
      collected 2 ml of dilute solution per 10 ml of concentrated
      solution; generally this took 2.5 hours.<br>
      <br>
      [0000] Salt Separation &amp; Small Osmolality Difference Measured
      with the Osmometer<br>
      <br>
      [0046] After experiments with the microspheres were carried out,
      we began experiments with salt solutions (e.g., sodium chloride,
      ~500 mmol/l). Initially, these experiments were carried out the
      same way as with the microspheres solution. The experimental setup
      was similar or the same, although a microscope was not used for
      adjusting the flow velocity because no microsphere markers were
      present. Of seven example experiments conducted, four showed
      osmolality difference between “concentrated” and “dilute”
      fractions. Experimental results for these are shown in the Table
      (1) below.<br>

      [0047] The repeatability of the salt solution separation
      measurements in each experiment was significantly high. In some
      circumstances, it may be that the exclusion zone is considerably
      smaller with high concentrations of salt than with microspheres in
      pure water; hence, the outer annulus collected some pure water and
      mostly salt water. A collector with smaller annulus can be built
      for salt exclusion.<br>
      <br>
      <b>NAFION Tube Swelling Experiments</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0048] We observed that sometimes, some grades of NAFION swell
      less in salt solutions than in pure water. The higher the
      osmolality, the less the NAFION swells. Thus, one possibility is
      that salt ions are held by the water molecules—they do not enter
      the NAFION polymer, either within the NAFION wall itself, or
      immediately around the wall. In other words, they may not
      penetrate into the exclusion zone.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] We hypothesized that if salt ions do not enter in or around
      the polymer network, then, as the NAFION swells, the salt
      concentration of the solution used to swell the NAFION becomes
      higher. This hypothesis was tested in the following experiment.
      First, a salt solution of known concentration was pumped inside
      the dry NAFION tube. The outside of the tube was dry. After
      approximately 10 minutes the NAFION tube swelled, at the expense
      of the solution inside. Then, the remaining solution was pumped
      out of the NAFION tube, and its osmolality was measured. Three
      experiments were carried out. Each time, there was an osmolality
      increase following swelling (see Table (2) below). Hence, the
      results support the hypothesis: it appears that salt is excluded
      from around the NAFION polymer; only water appears to enter.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] To check this result, calculations were made based on the
      assumption that only water molecules enter the NAFION polymer
      network. The NAFION tube was weighed as shown in FIG. 5, before
      and after swelling, and therefore the amount of water that enters
      was known. With this data, it can be calculated what the predicted
      concentration increase in the tube's lumen should be. Table (2)
      below shows excellent agreement, within several percent. Hence,
      the assumption that no salt enters in/around the NAFION polymer
      was tentatively validated.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] Controls were made to test the possibility that the
      observed increase of osmolality might arise artifactually, from
      some chemicals diffusing out of the NAFION. This possibility was
      tested by swelling the NAFION in deionized water instead of salt
      water. The solution removed from the NAFION tube showed no
      measurable increase of osmolarity. Hence, the increase of
      osmolality in Table (2) below was considered to have arisen from
      salt, excluded from the NAFION network.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] There may be a distinction between the water lying within,
      and immediately outside of, the NAFION tubing. Both are in the
      vicinity of polymer. If they behave similarly, then salt is deemed
      to be definitely absent from the exclusion zone. If not, then it
      is possible that the salt is excluded only from the water fraction
      lying within the tubing, but not from the fraction adjacent to it.<br>
      <br>

      <b>Alternate Embodiments</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0053] When experimenting with microsphere suspensions, we found
      that it is possible to draw small amounts of microsphere-free
      water from the exclusion zone. Practical success depends on how
      small the exclusion zone is with salt present. In the case of salt
      solutions, a NAFION tube can be used to create an exclusion zone.
      Then, a micropipette with tip diameter of, for example, 10 µm can
      be used to suck water via a tiny opening adjacent to the NAFION
      surface. By repeating this many times in a model setup, it is
      possible to collect solution, e.g., enough solution for osmolality
      measurements. Alternatively, a single step sample can be used to
      collect a very small amount of water. Speed of evaporation of this
      solution can be compared with evaporation of the solution taken
      farther from the NAFION surface. Practically salt-free water
      should evaporate more rapidly than relatively salty water.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] Another measurement approach uses a sodium-sensitive
      electrode. These can be obtained with tips on the order of 1 mm,
      and even smaller tips may be available. If the exclusion zone is
      large enough, then the electrode should reveal the spatial
      distribution of concentration in the vicinity of NAFION. If
      necessary, the concentration of salt could be reduced to expand
      the exclusion zone.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] In one implementation, an extractor collects water from a
      narrow annulus, e.g., much narrower than the 100 µm used in one
      implementation in the lab. This facilitates collection of water in
      situations in which the exclusion zone is much smaller than is the
      case with microspheres. A NAFION (or equivalent polymer) tube with
      an array of small holes may also be used, so that the relatively
      sodium-free water exits outside the tube rather than from an
      annulus within the tube.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Using Electrical Potential to Increase the Size of the
        Exclusion Zone</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0056] Electrical potentials may also be applied to increase the
      size of the exclusion zone and hence the efficacy of separation.
      For example, in one implementation water molecules migrate toward
      a negatively charged (cathode) surface. That is, the applied
      charge enhances the hydrophilic character of the exclusion
      surface, thereby increasing the region of purified water.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] In another implementation, a potential difference is
      applied between parallel wires several cm apart in an aqueous
      mixture, suspension, or solution. For example, with five volts
      between the wires, microsphere exclusion may increase to a
      centimeter or more from the negative electrode. With proper choice
      of material for the wire(s), (e.g., similar to materials used in
      maintenance-free auto batteries) bubbles (electrolysis) are
      virtually absent.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Further Detail</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0058] One objective during development was to lay groundwork for
      an exemplary device that can separate salt and other solutes from
      water. To design such a device, we observed that solutes tend to
      be excluded from the zone adjacent to many hydrophilic surfaces.
      Solutes observed to be excluded ranged from micron-sized colloidal
      solutes, for example, down to small molecular weight dyes.
      Hydrophilic surfaces that exclude these solutes include various
      hydrogels and polymeric surfaces. Exclusion is seen not only in
      static situations but also when the aqueous suspension or solution
      flows in channels cut inside of gels, and this formed the basis
      for several implementations of the exemplary device.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] In one implementation, salt water, or otherwise
      contaminated water, flows into the gel or polymer channel, and the
      salt molecules progressively migrate from the wall toward the
      channel axis (center of the tube).<br>
      <br>
      [0060] This concentrated solution in the channel core is discarded
      or recycled, while the pure water in the annular region (i.e.,
      outer region of the tube lumen) is collected. Variations of the
      exemplary technique were tested under a series of experimental
      conditions, in order to optimize purification and throughput.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] In one implementation, as described above, we examined
      microspheres suspended in aqueous solution in the vicinity of
      hydrogel surfaces. The microspheres translated away from the
      surface, leaving a microsphere-free zone that was unexpectedly
      large relative to expectations of classical theory (Israelachvili,
      1992): depending on conditions, the microsphere-free zone was on
      the order of 100 µm or more. Because the depletion of microspheres
      from the vicinal zone left pure water, this principle can be
      applied to the separation of suspended or dissolved entities,
      including salt.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] An example of this kind of exclusion is shown in FIG. 6.
      The gel-water boundaries are the vertically oriented, thin, white
      lines. (The vertically oriented fuzzy band to the right of “gel”
      is an optical reflection artifact.) Microspheres migrated away
      from the gel surface, leaving, within minutes, a zone ~250 µm that
      was devoid of microspheres.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] FIG. 7 shows another example of exemplary solute exclusion.
      In FIG. 7, the exclusion-inducing surface is again NAFION. FIG. 7
      shows a time-dependent buildup of the solute exclusion zone, which
      typically grows in minutes to 0.5 mm or more.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] Our subsequent studies have shown the exemplary exclusion
      methods to be generally applicable. Exemplary exclusion was
      observed not only in the vicinity of a series of synthetic and
      natural hydrogels, but also near other hydrophilic surfaces
      including carboxylated monolayers, PEGylated surfaces, and
      biological surfaces (muscle and vascular endothelium). In various
      implementations, excluded species include microspheres of either
      charge polarity, red blood cells, ion-exclusion resin beads,
      fluorophore-labeled protein (albumin—as shown in FIG. 8), and
      various low molecular weight dyes. FIG. 9, for example, shows the
      time course for exclusion of the fluorophore, sodium fluorescein,
      in the vicinity of NAFION.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] In both cases in FIGS. 8 and 9, these relatively low
      molecular weight solutes are excluded at least qualitatively by an
      amount similar to the much larger colloidal microspheres. Thus,
      the size range of excluded species can be broad from micron-sized
      particles down to small molecules. All of these solutes,
      suspensions, etc., are excluded from vicinal water, presumably by
      some surface induced alteration of that water. In one
      implementation, we derived evidence that at least three physical
      features of the vicinal water are different from bulk water: NMR
      hydrogen nuclei relaxation times; ability to support sustained
      potential difference; and sharply diminished infrared radiation
      from the vicinal water zone.<br>
      <br>
      [0066] Considering the broad size range of solutes confirmed to be
      excluded (12 orders of magnitude in mass), molecules beyond this
      range, i.e., even smaller than the lowest molecular weight dyes
      (e.g., mol. wt. 376) can be excluded as well.<br>
      <br>
      [0067] In some experiments, we built polyacrylic acid gels (also
      some polyvinyl alcohol gels) containing long, cylindrical
      channels, as shown in FIG. 10. Solute-containing water is pumped
      through the channel; or, in the case of a vertically oriented
      channel, the suspension can flow by the force of gravity; external
      power is then unnecessary. At the entry, the solute is distributed
      uniformly over the cross-section. Farther along the channel, the
      solute can be progressively excluded from the zone just inside the
      gel. With sufficient tube length, the sub-annular region will be
      solute free for practical purposes, or, actually solute free given
      a theoretically long enough tube.<br>
      <br>
      [0068] This solute-free water can then be collected using an
      annular channel 1002 whose outer diameter 1004 is equal to the
      inner diameter of the gel (FIG. 10, right side). The
      solute-containing water in the collection zone 1008 is in the
      center, i.e., inside the annular solute-free zone being collected
      by the annular channel 1002. When the solute-containing water is
      in short supply (e.g., the solute is precious), the
      solute-containing water can be recovered, so that the process can
      be repeated in cascading stages.<br>
      <br>
      [0069] As shown in FIG. 11, some initial studies were carried out
      using 1-µm carboxylate microspheres, easily detectable with a
      compound microscope. Polyacrylic acid gels were molded to contain
      a cylindrical channel, 1.6 mm in diameter 50 mm long. Using a
      motor-driven syringe, suspensions of microspheres were driven
      through the channel. Because the gel was clear, the microspheres
      within the channel could be easily visualized. Clear, stable,
      exclusion zones increased with time (and increased faster with
      smaller molecular weight substances; see FIGS. 8 and 9), and grew
      to appreciable size at distances sufficiently far from the entry
      orifice. From the left, FIG. 11 shows the time course of
      microsphere distribution 45 mm from entry point at various times
      after exposure to suspension. The gel boundary is the dark region
      at top. At this low magnification, microspheres are seen as small,
      uniform dots. On the right in FIG. 11 is seen microsphere
      distribution and growing exclusion zone ten minutes after
      exposure, at successive locations (10 mm, 25 mm, and 45 mm) along
      the channel.<br>
      <br>
      [0070] In one implementation, the “solute” is pathogens, to be
      concentrated for easier identification. Thus, although an
      exemplary system can be used to separate salt from water, it can
      also be useful for separating contaminants from water.<br>
      <br>
      [0071] One advantage of the exemplary differential extractor 100
      is its simplicity. Once designed, it can be manufactured
      inexpensively, easy to keep functional, and simple to use.
      Portable units may operate without supply of external electrical
      power—by using gravity flow. In geographical regions of scarce
      water supply, gray water, e.g., from a shower, can be recycled,
      making an exemplary apparatus useful in special environments, such
      as space vehicles or submarines, where water is in short supply.<br>
      <br>
      [0072] NAFION constitutes a powerful exclusion-generating surface
      in static situations, and may be superior for some applications to
      gels used to obtain results in flow situations such as that of
      FIG. 10. NAFION, a durable material, is widely used in fuel-cell
      applications, and can be micro-machined to contain arrays of micro
      fluidic channels for quick and effective separation.<br>
      <br>
      [0073] In pursuing salt separation, one challenge is detection of
      differences in concentration of ionic species. While microspheres
      are detectable under bright field microscopy and fluorophores are
      detectable under fluorescence microscopy, direct measurements of
      salt concentration may require sampling of the fluids. One
      implementation uses a small cylindrical tube inserted near to and
      parallel to the (polyacrylic gels or NAFION) excluding surface. To
      prevent premature capillary action while the tube is being
      positioned, the distal end of the tube can be temporarily sealed.
      Once the tube is in place, the seal is removed; then fluid flows
      by capillary action (or can be drawn by a pump if necessary) and
      collected for later analysis using an osmometer.<br>
      <br>
      [0074] In one implementation, the exclusion surfaces of an
      exemplary differential extractor 100 were obtained as follows.
      Convenient samples of NAFION are 180-µm-thick sheets, which can be
      cut for experiments. Polyacrylic acid (PAAc) can be synthesized in
      the laboratory. For example, a solution can be prepared by
      diluting 30 ml of 99% acrylic acid with 10 ml deionized water.
      Then, 20 mg N,N'-ethylenebisacrylamide is added as a cross-linking
      agent, and 90 mg potassium persulfate is added as an initiator.
      The solution is vigorously stirred at room temperature until all
      solutes are completely dissolved, and then introduced into a
      chamber 1.5 mm high, in which a 1-mm glass rod, later removed for
      cylindrical channel experiments, is suspended at mid-height.
      Gelation takes place as the temperature is slowly raised to about
      70° C. The temperature is then maintained at 80° C. for one hour
      to ensure complete gelation. Synthesized gels are carefully
      removed from the capillary tubes, rinsed with deionized water, and
      stored in a large volume of deionized water, refreshed daily, for
      one week.<br>
      <br>
      [0075] Controls can be carried out first to ensure that collection
      of fluid by the tube—or even the presence of the tube itself—does
      not interfere with the exclusion zone. One technique is to monitor
      the exclusion-zone boundary by optical microscopy, using
      microspheres (1 µm, carboxylate) as markers. Since the
      microspheres can be easily visualized, this method also permits
      the detection of any convective flows. If the tube itself
      compromises the zone, different materials can be used as
      alternates. Slow withdrawal of fluid from the exclusion zone
      typically does not induce much disturbance; however, if any
      disturbance is noted, the collection rate can be slowed until the
      disturbance becomes negligibly small, the tradeoff being increased
      time required for collection.<br>
      <br>
      [0076] To sample from a broader, more representative zone, the
      tube can be steadily but gently withdrawn parallel to the
      exclusion surface during collection. Again, it may be important to
      test in the same way as above whether withdrawal disturbs the
      exclusion zone, and if necessary, collected samples can be
      analyzed for microsphere contamination.<br>
      <br>
      [0077] Once the controls confirm the stability of a given
      implementation, additional controls can be carried out to test the
      efficacy of sampling. These tests can be carried out on NAFION and
      polyacrylic acid surfaces exposed to aqueous solutions of small
      molecular weight dyes. Dyes are ordinarily separated out
      satisfactorily. It is useful to confirm the absence of dye from
      drawn samples of different volume. These samples can be compared
      against standards in a fluorimeter. This helps to establish the
      size of sample volumes required to avoid contamination in the
      salt-exclusion processes.<br>
      <br>
      [0078] Next, exclusion of salt can be tested. NaCl concentration
      can be 100 mM to start. The region of the exclusion zone
      immediately adjacent to the excluding surface can be sampled
      first, as this is the region within which salt should be most
      profoundly excluded. Samples drawn from this region can be tested
      using osmometry. Next, a micrometer drive can be used to translate
      the tube to a position ~100 µm more distant from the surface, and
      samples can again be collected. The protocol can be repeated at
      100 µm intervals in order to obtain a profile of [NaCl] vs.
      distance from the excluding surface. A priori, in one
      implementation, undetectably low concentrations continue for a
      distance of several hundred micrometers, followed by a rapid
      falloff at roughly 0.5 mm from the surface. If increased
      measurement resolution seems warranted, smaller collection tubes
      can be used, and spatial increments can be reduced.<br>
      <br>
      [0079] Separation can be implemented at different NaCl
      concentrations ranging from 1 mM up to 1 M (ordinary seawater is
      0.4 M to 0.45 M). If increased detection sensitivity is required
      for low concentrations, atomic absorption spectrometry can be used
      instead of osmometry—several atomic absorption spectrometers are
      satisfactory for use. We have noted a diminution of exclusion-zone
      size with salt concentration, ~40% reduction as [NaCl] rose from
      nominally zero to 100 mM; hence, with the addition of salt there
      is a more rapid falloff of separation efficacy with distance from
      the excluding surface.<br>
      <br>
      [0080] The separation of salts other than NaCl is possible too, as
      water often contains a variety of salts other than NaCl, albeit in
      lower quantity. The exclusion-zone size may be compromised by
      different salts in different ways; i.e., reduction of
      exclusion-zone size depends on the salt's position in the
      Hofmeister series, K+&gt;Na+&gt;Li+&gt;Ca2+. It can be useful to
      verify these preliminary observations systematically, and then
      test the efficacy of separation of each one of them. Ideally, they
      can be separated with much the same efficacy of NaCl; however if
      these salts compromise the exclusion zone sufficiently, then
      collection parameters may need to be adjusted.<br>
      <br>
      [0081] Other relevant variables that may be important to test for
      their ultimate practical value include above all, temperature and
      pH. The former can be evaluated by using a temperature-controlled
      stage during salt-separation tests, while the latter can be
      evaluated by adding HCl or NaOH to vary the pH between 3 and 12
      with continuous pH monitoring. The optimum result reveals the
      absence of any strong dependence of either of these variables on
      efficacy of separation; however, a noted dependence can be
      compensated for in the implementation.<br>
      <br>
      [0082] In one implementation, the exemplary technique removes
      sea-salts from seawater. In one process, Puget Sound seawater
      (Na+=410 mM) was used, and tests were carried out as above. The
      goal was Na+ removal effective enough to reach EPA drinking-water
      standards (20 mg/l, or around 0.9 mM)
      (http://www.epa.gov/safewater/ccl/sodium.html).<br>
      <br>
      [0083] In another implementation, the exemplary technique
      separates bacteria and viruses from the aqueous mixture, for
      decontamination applications, in much the same way as salt
      separation was accomplished above.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Detail of Pathogen Separation</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0084] Common bacteria have a size in the micrometer range, some
      larger; hence, they are detectable by optical microscopy, most
      clearly using phase or DIC microscopy. Viruses elude practical
      detection by optical microscopy; hence, they can be labeled with a
      fluorophore and detected by fluorescence microscopy. Excluding
      surfaces can be the same as those used above, polyacrylic-acid
      gels, and NAFION. Similar collection strategies as used above can
      be used in this application. Various common bacteria and viruses
      were considered, limited to non-pathogenic varieties such as
      heat-inactivated samples that require no special facilities.
      Bacteria include: Escherichia coli (HB101) and Pseudomonas
      aeruginosa purchasable from American Type Culture Collection
      (Manassas, Va., USA). Viruses include adenovirus, SV40, and
      influenza available from Virapur (San Diego, Calif., USA). These
      can be fluorophore labeled.<br>
      <br>
      [0085] Different implementations may vary the conditions used for
      removing the pathogens. The pH can be varied from 3 to 12 with
      NaOH and HCl with continuous pH monitoring, and runs can be
      carried out at each pH value. Salt concentration can be varied
      from the low level of pure water, all the way up to molar values.
      Temperature can be varied too, as described above.<br>
      <br>
      [0086] In the case of bacteria, and unlike salt, because the
      exclusion zone is visually detectable, the exemplary technique can
      measure not only the extent of exclusion, but also the rate at
      which the exclusion zone develops.<br>
      <br>
      [0087] These measurements are performed by abruptly exposing the
      exclusion surface to a suspension of bacteria, and tracking the
      time course of exclusion zone development. Such dynamic
      measurements are important features to bear in mind when a
      particular exemplary purification system is designed. Another
      aspect to keep in mind is measurement of separation dynamics
      during flow in cylindrical tubes (FIG. 10, above).<br>
      <br>
      [0088] Having established the basic exclusionary features,
      including how much each type of solute is excluded and the
      magnitudes of the respective exclusion zones, the next step is to
      exploit those features in an implementation. A basic starting
      point is the implementation of microsphere separation during flow
      in cylindrical channels that was discussed above.<br>
      <br>
      [0089] In one implementation, the channels are easily made: the
      gel is molded to contain a cylindrical glass rod, which is removed
      once the gel has set. In the case of NAFION, tubular samples with
      diameter ~0.5 nm can be obtained from the supplier. Because the
      NAFION wall is thin, visualizing particles or fluorescence within
      the channel should engender no serious difficulty.<br>
      <br>
      [0090] A syringe pump is used to drive suspensions through the
      channel. (Improved versions of the pump can eliminate residual
      pulsations and result in higher precision measurements.) For test
      purposes, a sample may be placed on a microscope stage, flow is
      imposed by the pump, and the distribution of microspheres is
      measured at different times at a single location, and at different
      positions along the channel. Such tests reveal the time- and
      distance-dependence of exclusion prior to manufacture of the
      implementation.<br>
      <br>
      [0091] Measurements such as those just described can be carried
      out on different solutes. Knowing the size of the exclusion zone
      in static situations (FIGS. 6-9) will shortcut the number of
      trials (e.g., flow rate, channel diameter and length, etc.)
      required to establish reasonable parameters such as flow rate for
      separation of salt, as well as for separation of pathogens.<br>
      <br>
      [0092] For effective exclusion, different solutes may require
      different physical and geometric exclusion parameters. However, it
      may turn out that a particular set of parameters is acceptable for
      the exclusion not only of salt(s), but also of a range of
      pathogenic substances. In such a case, it may be possible to
      remove all of these in a single filtration pass, without requiring
      multiple stages. FIG. 12 shows a system for collecting purified
      water, i.e., a fixture designed to collect effluent from a gel
      separation channel. The collection system is designed to interface
      with the exit of the gel-separation unit; in FIG. 10, it
      corresponds to the collection zone 1008 on the right. The design
      in FIG. 12 involves a double cylinder, for collection of annular
      (solute-free) and core (solute-containing) flows; similar to that
      of FIG. 10. An initial design of the unit in FIG. 12 can be made
      using thin-walled stainless steel tubing. The interface end of the
      apparatus may be inserted into the end of the gel or NAFION
      channel. The inner tube or “waste outlet” is designed to catch the
      solute-containing fluid, and is connected to an exit tube, which
      either discards the fluid, or saves it for recycling. The annular
      ring between the inner and outer tube extracts the purified water,
      which flows out through a side-exit port for collection.<br>
      <br>
      [0093] For both fractions, pumps may be useful to facilitate more
      rapid flow. Dimensions and materials for effective water
      collection devices may be optimized. The size of the inner
      cylinder is sometimes critical in ensuring that the maximum
      quantity of salt or impurity is removed. This follows for two
      reasons: (i) the salt-containing zone of the separator may need to
      project entirely within the collector's inner cylinder; and, (ii)
      the exclusion zone might not exclude uniformly, so that, for
      example, regions at low radius just beyond the salt-containing
      zone may still contain some amounts of salt whereas regions at
      larger radius may be truly salt free. Cylinder diameter can be
      carefully tested for each solute of interest. Thus, using a set
      “standard” for gel-channel conditions, collection ducts with a
      series of internal diameters can be tested to check for optimum
      efficacy.<br>
      <br>
      [0094] It is also useful to check a series of materials other than
      stainless steel, including various nonreactive metals and
      polymers, as it is not clear a priori whether a hydrophilic or
      hydrophobic material will result in optimum collection. Water must
      flow freely into the tube; yet it should not stick excessively to
      the tube's walls. Hence some combination of hydrophilic and
      hydrophobic properties may be necessary to optimize the ability to
      collect. One important consideration can be the collection speed
      in the absence of vacuum pumping. This can be important in an
      effort to make the system independent of the need for external
      power.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Optimizing an Exemplary System</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0095] If drinking water is to be filtered from pathogenic
      substances, then testing should be done on ordinary drinking water
      to which pathogens have been added. If purification turns out not
      to be adequate in these situations, then backtracking can obtain
      adequate purification, e.g., by adding one solute at a time to
      pure water to determine which may be the “offending” agent.<br>
      <br>
      [0096] Testing can also achieve the optimum excluding material.
      Polyacrylic acid gels and NAFION are good candidates, because they
      produce abundant exclusion. However, these surfaces are not
      necessarily optimal for all solutes, and there are countless other
      materials that can be customized for various solutes. In
      particular, gels and polymers studied thus far have been neutral
      (polyvinyl alcohol) or negatively charged (e.g., polyacrylic
      acid). The one positively charged surface (aminated
      styrene-DVB-copolymer) explored briefly gave positive results.
      Hence, in some cases positively charged gels (e.g., chitosan) may
      exclude both pathogenic substances and salt. In such a case,
      systematic studies including pH dependence can be carried out for
      optimizing the excluding material. In some instances,
      complementarity exists between negatively charged and positively
      charged surfaces, and the most effective separation may include
      one layer of each, or some spatial surface arrangement of
      positively and negatively charged regions.<br>
      <br>
      [0097] Surfaces to be utilized may include functionalized
      monolayers (SAMS). Monolayer results obtained with exposed
      carboxyl groups showed ample exclusion of carboxylate
      microspheres. The ability to functionalize surfaces opens many
      possibilities in terms of ultimate manufacture.<br>
      <br>
      [0098] In one implementation, the system is as independent of
      external electrical power as possible. It is also beneficial to
      balance purification efficacy with rapid throughput. Rapid
      throughput implies diminishing drag during flow through narrow
      channels. In one implementation, the friction in tubes lined with
      certain block co-polymers is massively diminished—by as much as
      three orders of magnitude (Raviv et al., 2003). If these polymers,
      e.g., PMMA—PSGMA, are also found to create exclusion zones for a
      given solute, then it is possible to achieve reasonable solute
      separation, while at the same time achieving substantially
      enhanced throughput as a result of lowered resistance—driven only
      by the force of gravity. In that situation, the system can operate
      much like a household water filter, with simple gravity-driven
      flow.<br>
      <br>
      [0099] In one implementation, an exemplary apparatus is created
      through microfabrication. If the optimum channel size is in the
      range of hundreds of microns or less, then microfabrication can
      create arrays of channels. An example is shown in FIG. 13. The top
      of FIG. 13 is oriented upward, and the rectangles represent the
      excluding surfaces. The unpurified water enters at the top, and as
      it proceeds downward, the exclusion zone grows.<br>
      <br>
      [0100] The contaminated water (stippled) exits at the bottom
      through a connecting channel. The purified water (clear) enters a
      collecting duct (broad “U” in diagram). Because identical,
      slab-like units are stacked upon one another, the U-shaped ducts
      create channels oriented normal to the plane of the diagram.
      Purified water is collected at the ends of those channels. Slight
      tilt out of the plane of the paper can bias the flow in one or the
      other direction, facilitating collection.<br>
      <br>
      [0101] The exemplary array of FIG. 13 can operate purely by
      gravitational force or by pumps to facilitate flow.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Exemplary Methods</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0102] FIG. 14 shows a representative exemplary method 1400 of
      separating components of aqueous mixtures. In the flow diagram,
      the operations are summarized in individual blocks. The exemplary
      method 1400 may be performed by hardware, such as the exemplary
      differential extractor 100.<br>
      <br>
      [0103] At block 1402, an aqueous mixture (suspension, solution,
      etc.), is flowed over a hydrophilic surface, i.e., an exclusion
      surface, or in some cases a hydrophobic surface. Example materials
      for such an exclusion surface are certain gels, polymers; NAFION,
      etc.<br>
      <br>
      [0104] At block 1404, purified water can be collected in a first
      region near the hydrophilic surface. The exemplary differential
      extractor 100 may have an annular tube that lifts only the
      purified water.<br>
      <br>
      [0105] At block 1404, one or more concentrated non-aqueous
      components of the aqueous mixture may be collected in a second
      region beyond the first region of the purified water, with respect
      to the exclusion surface. The exemplary differential extractor 100
      may have a center or core tube that draws the concentrated
      non-aqueous components from the apparatus.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Alternative Implementation</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0106] In an alternate implementation, it has been found that
      solutes were excluded from a region just below the top surface of
      water, at the air-water interface. With a chamber (or tank) made
      from two large flat pieces of glass separated by 3 mm, a
      microsphere suspension was added, and the chamber was viewed
      facing one of the glass pieces. The zone just beneath the surface
      began to clear. Within 30 minutes a 2-mm zone (herein referred to
      as an exclusion zone) was fully devoid of microspheres. The
      exclusion zone remained devoid of microspheres for many hours.
      This was not the result of microsphere settling, which took place
      at approximately 24 hours after filling the chamber.<br>
      <br>
      [0107] Other implementations to create water separation in an
      aqueous solution are described in an article titled “Cylindrical
      phase separation in colloidal suspensions,” by Kate Ovchinnikova
      and Gerald H. Pollack (accepted for publication in Physical Review
      E by the American Physical Society, January, 2009), which is
      hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
      <br>
      [0108] An example diagram 150 of a tank 151 including an aqueous
      solution with an air layer, a meniscus layer, and bulk water,
      which may contain microspheres and is thus labeled
      “water+microspheres.” The clear zone, corresponds to the exclusion
      zone 152 is shown in FIG. 15. The exclusion zone 152 has
      characteristics similar to the exclusion zones described above.
      When the aqueous solution contains microsphere markers, not only
      does the zone 152 exclude those microspheres, but also its upper
      region has negative potential, much like exclusion zones. Further
      the solution remains at constant width even as the upper surface
      of water is lifted and moved from side to side with a vertically
      oriented charged rod. Hence, this zone 152 is mechanically
      cohesive, much like exclusion zones.<br>
      <br>
      [0109] The tank 151 may be used for establishing a volume of an
      aqueous mixture having a surface. In addition an apparatus
      collects water at the surface of an aqueous mixture. The apparatus
      may establish an exclusion zone 152 with a depth in the aqueous
      mixture. In one implementation, the apparatus may collect water at
      the surface when the depth of the aqueous mixture is greater than
      approximately four times the depth of the exclusion zone 152,
      although any depth may be suitable provided the depth of the
      aqueous mixture is greater than the depth of the exclusion zone.
      The aqueous mixture may include a mixture of water, particles and
      solutes and includes particles and solutes whose removal is
      desired. In one implementation the depth of the exclusion zone 152
      is about 2 mm.<br>
      <br>
      [0110] A collection apparatus including a tube may collect water
      and transfer the collected water from a tank 151 to a collecting
      chamber. The collection apparatus may stop collecting when the
      water in the exclusion zone 152 has been fully transferred from
      the tank 151 to the collecting chamber. An apparatus may also be
      provided to admit more mixture to the tank 151 to let the
      exclusion zone 152 build for later collection.<br>
      <br>
      [0111] In another implementation a skimming apparatus (as
      generally known) that includes the tube may continuously skim the
      exclusion-zone water on the surface of the aqueous solution or
      aqueous mixture. A controller to the skimmer may be provided to
      adjust the collection rate from the tank 151 to a collection
      chamber so that a rate of buildup of water in the exclusion zone
      152 and collection of water reach a steady state.<br>
      <br>
      [0112] The presence of a solute-exclusion zone at the upper
      surface of water provides an environment in which water can be
      skimmed off to provide purified water.<br>
      <br>
      [0113] In one flow embodiment, a tank's 151 upper zone is
      connected through a downward slanted tube to a lower collecting
      chamber. A valve opens periodically to allow flow from tank 151 to
      collecting chamber to occur. The tank 151 is then replenished with
      the aqueous solution.<br>
      <br>
      [0114] In another embodiment, an upper zone in tank 151 is set up
      similar to the flow embodiment except that a pump is used to
      facilitate withdrawal of the top layer.<br>
      <br>
      [0115] In another embodiment, the upper zone of the tank 151 is
      set up similar to the flow embodiment except that multiple stages
      are used to achieve further purification.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Illustrative Fraction Collection</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0116] FIG. 16 is a diagram illustrating principal features of an
      apparatus 1602 for collecting a fraction of a mixture, suspension,
      or solution of a polar liquid, according to an embodiment. As used
      herein, a fraction is defined as a concentration of a mixed
      component, suspended component, or solute different from other
      concentrations of the mixed component, suspended component, or
      solute at different distances from an interface 1610 (described
      below).<br>
      <br>
      [0117] A first collector 1604 such as a collection tube is
      configured to collect a fraction of a mixture, suspension, or
      solution of a polar liquid 1606, 1608 at a selected distance at or
      away from an interface 1610 between the polar liquid and air or a
      hydrophilic surface 1612. A structure 1605 is configured to hold
      the first collector 1604 at the selected distance. A first
      fraction collected from a first region 1608 at a first distance at
      or away from the interface 1610 may comprise substantially pure
      polar liquid. A second fraction collected at a second distance
      away from the interface in the second region beyond a boundary
      1614 comprises a an increased concentration of a solute or
      particle component compared to the first fraction. The first
      region 1608 is also referred to as an exclusion zone that is
      formed by an interaction between the polar fluid 1606, 1608 and
      the air or hydrophilic surface 1612 according to mechanisms
      described herein. The polar liquid 1606, 1608 may be water.<br>
      <br>
      [0118] According to an embodiment, the first collector may be held
      at the first distance selected to collect the first fraction
      comprising substantially pure polar liquid from the first region
      1608 (exclusion zone), as shown. In some embodiments, the first
      region may extend to a distance of about 2 mm from the interface
      1610, where it forms the border 1614 with the second region.<br>
      <br>
      [0119] Alternatively, the first collector may held at the second
      distance beyond the boundary 1614 selected to collect the second
      fraction comprising the increased concentration of the solute or
      particle component (configuration not shown). Alternatively a
      first collector 1604 may be held at a first distance selected to
      collect the first fraction comprising substantially pure polar
      fluid from the first region, and a second collector (not shown)
      may be held to collect the second fraction comprising the
      increased concentration of the solute or particle component from
      the second region. Alternatively, a larger number of collectors
      1604 may be held to collect various fractions. Such collectors
      1604 may be configured to each collect potentially a different
      fraction from a different distance from the interface 1610, or may
      be configured to collect substantially the same fraction at
      substantially the same distance from the interface 1610.<br>
      <br>
      [0120] The structure 1605 may be configured to hold the first
      collector 1604 in a substantially constant position at or away
      from the interface 1610 between the polar liquid 1606, 1608 and
      air or a hydrophilic surface 1612. For example, the structure 1605
      may include a float configured to provide buoyancy to hold the
      collector 1604, and/or other associated hardware or liquid near
      the surface 1610 or an air 1612 interface. Optionally, the
      apparatus 1602 may include a vessel (not shown) for holding the
      mixture, suspension, or solution of the polar liquid 1606, 1608.<br>
      <br>
      [0121] FIGS. 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, and 15 illustrate sensing or
      output from sensing one or more of a position of the interface
      1610; a depth of an interface 1614 between first and second
      regions corresponding to an exclusion zone 1608 and concentrated
      phase, respectively; a concentration of a mixed component,
      suspended component. Moreover, referring to FIG. 16, a
      concentration of a mixed component, suspended component, or solute
      collected 1624 by the fraction collector 1604 through an opening
      1622 may be sensed. For example, referring to FIG. 3, the
      exclusion zone 110 and microspheres 102 (aka, the concentrated
      phase) are visualized from an optical detection technique, in this
      case sensing using a focal plane array image sensor coupled to
      receive an image through microscope optics. Similarly, FIG. 4 (as
      described by paragraph 38) shows optical absorbance profiles used
      to characterize and determine differences between the exclusion
      zone (aka, diluted) and the concentrated phase. Thus, an optical
      sensor can be used to determine the presence or absence of a
      solute or suspension at various locations relative to a fraction
      collector.<br>
      <br>
      [0122] Electrical sensing may also be performed to determine
      characteristics and location of an interface, exclusion zone, and
      concentrated or “bulk” phase. For example, the concentration of a
      salt solution can be correlated to the electrical conductivity of
      the solution. Thus an electrical sensor can be used to determine
      characteristics and location of an interface, exclusion zone, and
      concentrated or “bulk” phase. Such a sensor may be made to measure
      presence/absence of a polar liquid, and/or conductivity or
      resistivity of the polar liquid at various locations (e.g.,
      distances from an exclusion zone-forming interface 1610) in a
      solution.<br>
      <br>
      [0123] Moreover, as described above, a structure (e.g. including
      an actuator such as a micrometer drive) to hold and/or move a
      collection tube 1604.<br>
      <br>
      [0124] A sensor 1616 may similarly provide feedback to a control
      system to determine a collection location of a collection tube
      1604, for example to establish or maintain collection of a
      selected fraction of the polar liquid and mixed, suspended, or
      dissolved particles or solutes. According to an embodiment, the
      selected fraction may be substantially pure polar liquid.
      According to another embodiment, the selected fraction may include
      an enriched concentration of suspended or dissolved particles or
      solutes. Similarly, a sensor 1616 may be used to provide feedback
      for selecting one or more of a plurality of collectors 1604 for
      collection.<br>
      <br>
      [0125] Referring to FIG. 16, the structure 1605 may be configured
      to hold the first collector 1604 at an adjustable 1634 distance at
      or away from the interface 1610 between the polar liquid and air
      or a hydrophilic surface. One or more sensors 1616 may be
      configured to sense and output a sensor signal or data
      corresponding to one or more of a position 1618 of the interface
      between the polar liquid and air or a hydrophilic surface; a
      position 1620 of an interface 1614 between the first and second
      regions; a concentration of a mixed component, suspended
      component, or solute in the vicinity 1624 of the first collector
      1604 (and/or any second collector), such as near the intake 1622
      of the first collector 1604; or a concentration of a mixed
      component, suspended component, or solute collected 1626 by the
      first collector 1604 (and/or any second collector).<br>
      <br>
      [0126] A sensor signal or sensor data may be output by the sensor
      1616 to programmable logic 1628 such as a microcontroller, state
      machine, PID controller, or other apparatus configured to drive an
      actuator 1630 configured to adjust the position of the first
      collector 1604 (and/or any second collector) responsive to the
      sensor signal or data. For example, a rate of liquid collection
      may be decreased or stopped by controlling a pump or valve 1632 if
      a boundary 1614 between the exclusion zone 1608 and bulk fluid
      containing suspended particles or solute approaches a location
      1620 too close to a liquid intake 1622. Similarly, the distance
      (depth) of the collector 1602 may be set as a function of a
      detected location 1618 of the interface 1610 by actuating the
      position or configuration 1634 of the structure 1605.<br>
      <br>
      [0127] The sensor 1616 may use one or more of a variety of
      technologies to sense conditions relevant to liquid collection by
      the collector 1604. For example, the sensor may be an optical
      sensor, an ultrasonic or sonic sensor, or an electrical sensor.<br>
      <br>
      [0128] For example, an optical sensor 1616 can measure scattering
      caused by particles in the polar liquid 1606, 1608. Additionally
      or alternatively, an optical sensor 1616 can measure an absorption
      characteristic of a spectrum of a solute or suspension.
      Additionally or alternatively, an optical sensor 1616 can measure
      specular reflection off an air/liquid interface 1610, and given a
      characteristic exclusion zone 1608 thickness, one can infer the
      distance to the bottom 1614, 1620 of the exclusion zone. In
      systems where the polar liquid is water, the exclusion zone 1608
      was found to strongly absorb 270 nanometer ultraviolet light. The
      sensor 1616 can thus measure 270 nanometer absorption (or another
      absorption spectrum characteristic of an exclusion zone 1608 of
      water or another polar liquid), and optionally one or more
      reference wavelengths, to determine or infer the presence or
      thickness of the exclusion zone 1608. Accordingly, one or more
      optical characteristics may be measured by the sensor 1616 and
      output used by the logic 1628 to drive the actuator 1630.<br>
      <br>
      [0129] Similarly, electrical characteristics of the exclusion zone
      1608 and bulk or component-enriched polar liquid 1606 beyond the
      border 1614 of the exclusion zone may differ. Conductivity or
      electrical potential may, for example, be sensed by the sensor
      1616 at one or more various locations 1612, 1618, 1620, 1624,
      1626, and output used by the logic 1628 to drive the actuator
      1630. Alternatively a sonic or ultrasonic transmission or
      reflection characteristic may be measured by the sensor 1616 and
      output used by the logic 1628 to drive the actuator 1630.<br>
      <br>
      [0130] The actuator 1630 may be configured to adjust a pump or
      valve 1632 configured to control a rate of removal of the fraction
      by the first collector 1604. According to an embodiment,
      adjustment of a pump or valve 1632 may be used to select between
      collection by a plurality of collectors 1604. Alternatively or
      additionally, the actuator 1630 may be configured to adjust a
      position 1634 in which the structure 1605 holds the collector
      1604. The logic 1628 may receive the sensor signal or data and
      responsively drive the actuator to establish or maintain a desired
      collection fraction.<br>

      Systems and methods are described for separating components of
      aqueous mixtures, including aqueous solutions and suspensions. In
      one implementation, an apparatus flows the aqueous mixture over a
      hydrophilic surface to form a first region of purified water and a
      second region of at least one concentrated non-aqueous component.
      The apparatus can draw off either the purified water or the
      concentrated non-aqueous components. In one implementation, an
      array of tubules performs the differential extraction. In another
      implementation, various hydrophilic and/or hydrophobic surfaces
      are disposed in multiple differential extractors and some
      effluents may be recycled to perform complex assaying and
      separation. In a further implementation, an apparatus can draw off
      purified water just beneath the air-water interface.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0003] There is great need for purified water. Water demands are
      increasing worldwide, while water sources are becoming
      increasingly rare. Hence, any inexpensive method that can convert
      salt water to potable water would be extremely valuable. In very
      confined environments such as space vehicles or submarines where
      fresh water sources are scarce, water purification and recycling
      can be critically important. A method that converts “used”
      water—such as, black water, gray water, waste water, or even
      urine—into drinking water, is invaluable.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Likewise, there is a need for improved and alternative
      techniques for separating solutes, suspended particles,
      bio-organisms, etc., from aqueous mixtures, suspensions, and
      solutions—not necessarily to obtain pure water, but to collect and
      concentrate the non-aqueous components, e.g., to collect a product
      or for qualitative and quantitative analysis.<br>
      <br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      <b>Overview</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0021] This disclosure describes separating components of aqueous
      mixtures, suspensions, and solutions. The term “aqueous mixture”
      will be used herein to represent an aqueous mixture, suspension,
      or solution. To separate components, the aqueous mixture is
      exposed to a hydrophilic surface, such as the inside of tubes made
      of hydrophilic materials. A region of “purified water” forms near
      the hydrophilic surface in which one or more solutes or other
      non-aqueous components are partially or entirely excluded. Hence,
      the hydrophilic surface is also referred to herein as an
      “exclusion surface.” Likewise, a region of “concentrated solute”
      forms “away from” the exclusion surface. Thus, the gradient caused
      by the exclusion surface can be exploited to obtain purified water
      or to obtain a higher concentration of a non-aqueous component.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] Such aqueous mixtures include salt solutions, colloids,
      suspensions, waste water, bodily fluids, mining tailings, etc.,
      that is, most any combination of water and another compound or
      substance. Non-aqueous components of an aqueous mixture can
      include organic and inorganic salts, biomatter, pathogens,
      bacteria etc., and many other solids and semi-solids. For example,
      the exemplary techniques to be described herein can separate
      microspheres that are similar in size to bacteria to easily obtain
      a 20:1 separation.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] In one implementation, an exemplary method removes salts
      from water to obtain efficient desalination. The salts to be
      separated can include sodium chloride, seawater salts, components
      of buffer solutions, and many other salts and ionic compounds.
      Hence, exemplary methods can separate ionic (charged) components
      from water mixtures, or can separate neutral, non-ionic species
      from water mixtures too.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] From another perspective, the subject matter to be
      described can concentrate dissolved or suspended species from
      aqueous solutions. That is, instead of pure water being the only
      desired product, an exemplary method can be used to concentrate
      the non-aqueous components of an aqueous mixture. This can be
      useful in many manufacturing processes and in the clinical lab,
      e.g., for diagnosing medical conditions via blood work and other
      physiological tests that involve bodily or cellular fluids. The
      exemplary methods described herein can be used to separate and/or
      concentrate salts, pathogens, contaminants, dyes, organic and
      inorganic species, etc., from aqueous mixtures. Solute size can be
      as small as a few nanometers (e.g., molecular weight of
      approximately 300).<br>
      <br>
      [0025] In one implementation, multiple separation stages are
      performed in series, including, for example, a cascade of multiple
      similar stages iterated to amplify the effect, as well as
      variegated stages for different materials. Thus, process flow may
      follow a tree structure or flow diagram analogous to complex
      stages of a chemical synthesis or purification, in which different
      components are separated or concentrated at different times and in
      different quantities by different implementations or instances of
      the exemplary exclusion surface. The succession of stages allows
      an exemplary process to exclude more types of solutes from an
      increasingly purer aqueous mixture. The succession can also
      improve the purification of a single material, e.g., to
      automatically obtain a super pure product in the lab. Moreover, a
      user can specify which non-aqueous species are to be separated out
      or concentrated from an aqueous mixture.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Exemplary Process</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0026] We found that many solutes were excluded from a region
      adjacent to hydrophilic surfaces. Included among the excluded
      species were microspheres of various size, erythrocytes, proteins,
      and even small molecular weight dyes. Salts also appeared to be
      excluded. The exclusion zone varied in size, but in one
      implementation was several hundred micrometers wide. Given the
      large size of this zone, and the exclusion of many solutes, we
      discovered that the exclusion zone contained “pure” water, which
      could then be harvested. The formation of the exclusion zone was
      similar to the formation of ice—which crystallizes to the
      exclusion of foreign materials in its molecular structure.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] In general, negatively charged surfaces exclude negatively
      charged solutes, and positively charged surfaces exclude
      positively charged solutes. So, for many different solutes, a
      surface can be selected that will exclude solutes from a region of
      pure or purer water. Bacteria, viruses, etc., fall into size and
      charge domains as solutes that we typically tested, so these too
      can be excluded from the region of purified water. Biological
      specimens, such as red blood cells, were also excluded from this
      region. It is worth noting that negatively charged surfaces do, in
      general, exclude negatively charged solutes; however, some
      positively charged solutes are excluded as well. Similarly,
      positively charged surfaces generally exclude positively charged
      solutes, but also some negatively charged solutes as well.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Flow Profile Measurements</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0028] An initial issue to be tested was whether the water in such
      an exclusion zone near a surface was or was not bound to the
      nucleating surface (i.e., a gel, polymer, or other exclusion
      surface). If the water adhered tightly, then removal would not be
      easily possible. To pursue this question we used polyacrylic acid
      gels, with characteristic dimensions of several centimeters,
      containing a 2-mm channel. Because the gel was clear, the channel
      could be visualized using an optical microscope. Microsphere
      suspensions were forced through the channel under pressure. At the
      entryway, microspheres were uniformly distributed across the cross
      section. Farther along the channel, an exclusion zone developed:
      the annulus was clear, while the core region contained
      concentrated spheres. Still farther along, the clear annulus grew
      at the expense of the core, and ultimately, after several
      centimeters, the relative dimensions of annulus and core no longer
      changed.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] To assess whether annular water adhered to the gel surface,
      we measured volume flow at intervals of several millimeters along
      the channel. The profile could be measured only in the core, where
      microspheres were present, and not in the annulus, where there
      were no markers. Thus, the complete profile could be measured near
      the entryway, while only partial profiles could be measured
      farther along. Each profile was integrated to give volume flow.
      Thus, we could obtain volume flows in the microsphere-containing
      zones at intervals along the channel. If the integrated flows were
      equal at all points, then we would have concluded that the annular
      regions were adherent; only the microsphere-containing regions
      flowed. By contrast, we found that the integrated profiles
      diminished significantly with distance along the channel. This
      meant that volume flow in the microsphere zones decreased
      progressively along the channel. Or, in other words, some of the
      flow had to come from the clear annulus. We established that the
      annular region did, indeed, flow (at least in part), making
      possible the exemplary techniques.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Apparatus for Solute Separation</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0030] As shown in FIG. 1, an exemplary “differential extractor”
      100 separates a solution into concentrated and dilute (clear)
      fractions. The principle of the extraction is also illustrated in
      FIG. 1. A homogenous microsphere suspension 102 enters a NAFION
      tube 104 at one end (DuPont Corporation, Wilmington, Del.). NAFION
      is a Teflon-like polymer with exposed sulfonate groups, used in
      fuel cells, actuators, and other applications. In one
      implementation, NAFION was found to be an ideal exclusion surface
      and will be referred to herein as a representative material for
      the exemplary exclusion surface, although other materials can also
      be used for the exclusion surface. As the solution travels through
      the NAFION tube 104, the microspheres 102 migrate from the walls
      106 of the tube 104 and gather in the core region 108. Clear water
      from the exclusion zone 110 and microsphere-containing water 112
      pass through different channels of the extractor 100, and are then
      collected. In one implementation, the differential extractor 100
      is used to extract clear water.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] In FIG. 2, the dimensions of one implementation of the
      exemplary differential extractor 100 are given. An elevation view
      202 shows the two different channels that draw off the
      concentrated and diluted products of the separation. Of course,
      either the concentrated or diluted products of the extractor 100
      can be subjected to subsequent instances of the extractor 100 to
      provide further concentration or dilution of the particular
      product. The concentration branch or the dilution branch of the
      extractor 100 can even be looped back to the input of the NAFION
      tube to recycle the particular product multiple times through the
      same extractor 100.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] Another implementation of an extraction schema is shown in
      FIG. 3. Pump “1” 302 and Pump “2” 304 reduce the pressure in the
      peripheral channel and the center channel, respectively, to
      facilitate collection. Pressure reduction in the channels results
      in inflow of solution into the channels with linear velocity
      proportional to the negative pressure generated by each pump. The
      negative pressures can be adjusted so that the linear velocity is
      equal in both channels. The concentrated and dilute solutions can
      be collected in different syringes. Importantly, in this
      implementation, the tube 104 itself can be immersed in the, e.g.,
      microsphere 102 (or salt) solution. Hence, the initial
      concentration in the solution outside the tube 104 is the same as
      that of the solution inside.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] Three differential extractors 100 are described as
      examples. In one implementation, the extractor 100 is constructed
      with glue. Brass bushings are used for maintaining tube
      concentricity. The proximal end of the extractor 100 is initially
      flush. This implementation shows that the exemplary extractor 100
      can be made of diverse materials, as long as they are impervious
      to the components being separated.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] In another implementation, the extractor 100 can be
      constructed from stainless steel tubing, and overall lengths can
      be increased to accommodate some different features. In this case,
      the extractor 100 incorporates an extension sleeve on the outer
      tubing to increase extraction efficiency.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] In yet another implementation, the differential extractor
      100 has larger diameter stainless steel tubing to accommodate a
      relatively larger NAFION tubing 104 that, especially effective for
      some applications. For example, construction can be carried out
      with low temperature silver solder, and concentricity can be
      maintained by dimpling the outer tube. The distance between inner
      and outer tube, the annulus, can be approximately 0.1 mm. Also,
      the central tube, used to collect highly concentrated
      microspheres, can be extended out 0.5 mm at the proximal end. This
      makes it possible to visualize the extraction process
      microscopically. This, in turn, may allow flows to be regulated in
      a sensitive manner to match the relative size of the exclusion
      zones. In one implementation, the smaller the exclusion zone 110,
      the larger should be the difference of flow in order to achieve
      good separation. Given the availability of a sensitive manner of
      adjusting flows, 10-20 times concentration difference can be
      obtained (e.g., see images in FIG. 1).<br>
      <br>
      [0036] The particular geometry and materials employed in the
      exemplary extractor 100 can be varied to improve results for a
      particular application. For instance, a polyacrylic-acid gel may
      also be used as the exclusion surface.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] In one implementation, particles in the micron-size range
      can be separated out of water using the exemplary techniques.
      Depending on refinement of the implementation, the extractor 100
      may achieve a 10:1 or 20:1 concentration difference ratio between
      purified water and microsphere enriched output. With multiple
      extraction stages in series, e.g., using different extraction
      surfaces, superb separation ratios are achievable. Separating
      (micron-sized) pathogens is therefore possible.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Spectrophotometric Studies</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0038] In one implementation, relatively slow flow in the NAFION
      tube is maintained in order to prevent turbulence, which increases
      reliability and may be used in circumstances in which the speed of
      extraction is of secondary importance. For example, in a model
      implementation, 100 ml of concentrated and 10 ml of dilute
      solution were collected over 10-12 hours.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] An exemplary method was adopted to detect even small
      differences in concentration. We found that spectrophotometer
      readings gave the first sign of successful separation, albeit
      sometimes they were very small. After two fractions were
      collected, absorption spectra were obtained for concentrated and
      dilute species using a UV-VIS spectrometer. Examples of absorption
      curves are shown in FIG. 4, where the upper curve corresponds to
      the concentrated fraction and the lower curve corresponds to the
      purified fraction. The result corresponds to one implementation,
      in which the separation ratio was relatively low, approximately
      1:2 or 1:3. Early development of the separation principle also
      showed that the spectrophotometric method could be used as a
      sensitive detector of even subtle differences between fractions.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Microsphere Counting</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0040] After the spectrophotometric approach for detecting a
      concentration gradient was pursued, an initial gel implementation
      was replaced by the NAFION tubing described above, and improved
      extractors were thereby developed. As development of exemplary
      methods progressed, the concentration difference between fractions
      grew sufficiently large, up to 20:1, that it could be seen by the
      naked eye, or measured accurately by use of a microscope.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] Thin layers of the concentrated and dilute fractions were
      therefore created and viewed with a microscope. Since the
      microscope has a finite depth of field, direct counting of
      microspheres in the field gives the number within some fixed
      volume, i.e., the concentration. By comparing the number of the
      microspheres in the respective fractions, the concentration
      difference could be ascertained. In one phase of development,
      approximately ten experiments were carried out. The layers of
      solution were of the same thickness, ca. 0.1 mm. The area was 1-2
      square cm.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] One result obtained using this approach showed a separation
      of between approximately 10:1 to 20:1. However, in this
      implementation the ratio was strongly dependent on the desired
      collection rate. If water from the outer annulus was drawn very
      slowly, we estimate that, practically, it will be possible to
      obtain separation coefficients of 100:1 or even higher—mainly
      because the exclusion zone never contains microspheres, even when
      the microsphere concentration is raised to high values.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Further Experimental Details</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0043] Initial microsphere concentration was 2.84×10exp6
      particles/ml in most experiments during development. In the
      photographs presented, the initial solution concentration was
      1.13×10exp7 particles/ml. POLYBEAD Carboxylate 2.0 µm microspheres
      were used and were diluted in distilled water (Polysciences, Inc.,
      Warrington, Pa.).<br>
      <br>
      [0044] The extraction speed, i.e., the volume flow inside the
      NAFION tube, was 1 ml/hour if the experiment was conducted
      overnight or 4-5 ml/hour during the daytime. With this speed, we
      collected 2 ml of dilute solution per 10 ml of concentrated
      solution; generally this took 2.5 hours.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0000] Salt Separation &amp; Small Osmolality Difference
        Measured with the Osmometer</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0045] After experiments with the microspheres were carried out,
      we began experiments with salt solutions (e.g., sodium chloride,
      ~500 mmol/l). Initially, these experiments were carried out the
      same way as with the microspheres solution. The experimental setup
      was similar or the same, although a microscope was not used for
      adjusting the flow velocity because no microsphere markers were
      present. Of seven example experiments conducted, four showed
      osmolality difference between “concentrated” and “dilute”
      fractions. Experimental results for these are shown in the Table
      (1) below.<br>

      [0046] The repeatability of the salt solution separation
      measurements in each experiment was significantly high. In some
      circumstances, it may be that the exclusion zone is considerably
      smaller with high concentrations of salt than with microspheres in
      pure water; hence, the outer annulus collected some pure water and
      mostly salt water. A collector with smaller annulus can be built
      for salt exclusion.<br>
      <br>
      <b>NAFION Tube Swelling Experiments</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0047] We observed that sometimes, some grades of NAFION swell
      less in salt solutions than in pure water. The higher the
      osmolality, the less the NAFION swells. Thus, one possibility is
      that salt ions are held by the water molecules—they do not enter
      the NAFION polymer, either within the NAFION wall itself, or
      immediately around the wall. In other words, they may not
      penetrate into the exclusion zone.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] We hypothesized that if salt ions do not enter in or around
      the polymer network, then, as the NAFION swells, the salt
      concentration of the solution used to swell the NAFION becomes
      higher. This hypothesis was tested in the following experiment.
      First, a salt solution of known concentration was pumped inside
      the dry NAFION tube. The outside of the tube was dry. After
      approximately 10 minutes the NAFION tube swelled, at the expense
      of the solution inside. Then, the remaining solution was pumped
      out of the NAFION tube, and its osmolality was measured. Three
      experiments were carried out. Each time, there was an osmolality
      increase following swelling (see Table (2) below). Hence, the
      results support the hypothesis: it appears that salt is excluded
      from around the NAFION polymer; only water appears to enter.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] To check this result, calculations were made based on the
      assumption that only water molecules enter the NAFION polymer
      network. The NAFION tube was weighed as shown in FIG. 5, before
      and after swelling, and therefore the amount of water that enters
      was known. With this data, it can be calculated what the predicted
      concentration increase in the tube's lumen should be. Table (2)
      below shows excellent agreement, within several percent. Hence,
      the assumption that no salt enters in/around the NAFION polymer
      was tentatively validated.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] Controls were made to test the possibility that the
      observed increase of osmolality might arise artifactually, from
      some chemicals diffusing out of the NAFION. This possibility was
      tested by swelling the NAFION in deionized water instead of salt
      water. The solution removed from the NAFION tube showed no
      measurable increase of osmolarity. Hence, the increase of
      osmolality in Table (2) below was considered to have arisen from
      salt, excluded from the NAFION network.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] There may be a distinction between the water lying within,
      and immediately outside of, the NAFION tubing. Both are in the
      vicinity of polymer. If they behave similarly, then salt is deemed
      to be definitely absent from the exclusion zone. If not, then it
      is possible that the salt is excluded only from the water fraction
      lying within the tubing, but not from the fraction adjacent to it.<br>

      <b>ALTERNATE EMBODIMENTS</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0052] When experimenting with microsphere suspensions, we found
      that it is possible to draw small amounts of microsphere-free
      water from the exclusion zone. Practical success depends on how
      small the exclusion zone is with salt present. In the case of salt
      solutions, a NAFION tube can be used to create an exclusion zone.
      Then, a micropipette with tip diameter of, for example, 10 µm can
      be used to suck water via a tiny opening adjacent to the NAFION
      surface. By repeating this many times in a model setup, it is
      possible to collect solution, e.g., enough solution for osmolality
      measurements. Alternatively, a single step sample can be used to
      collect a very small amount of water. Speed of evaporation of this
      solution can be compared with evaporation of the solution taken
      farther from the NAFION surface. Practically salt-free water
      should evaporate more rapidly than relatively salty water.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] Another measurement approach uses a sodium-sensitive
      electrode. These can be obtained with tips on the order of 1 mm,
      and even smaller tips may be available. If the exclusion zone is
      large enough, then the electrode should reveal the spatial
      distribution of concentration in the vicinity of NAFION. If
      necessary, the concentration of salt could be reduced to expand
      the exclusion zone.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] In one implementation, an extractor collects water from a
      narrow annulus, e.g., much narrower than the 100 µm used in one
      implementation in the lab. This facilitates collection of water in
      situations in which the exclusion zone is much smaller than is the
      case with microspheres. A NAFION (or equivalent polymer) tube with
      an array of small holes may also be used, so that the relatively
      sodium-free water exits outside the tube rather than from an
      annulus within the tube.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Using Electrical Potential to Increase the Size of the
        Exclusion Zone</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0055] Electrical potentials may also be applied to increase the
      size of the exclusion zone and hence the efficacy of separation.
      For example, in one implementation water molecules migrate toward
      a negatively charged (cathode) surface. That is, the applied
      charge enhances the hydrophilic character of the exclusion
      surface, thereby increasing the region of purified water.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] In another implementation, a potential difference is
      applied between parallel wires several cm apart in an aqueous
      mixture, suspension, or solution. For example, with five volts
      between the wires, microsphere exclusion may increase to a
      centimeter or more from the negative electrode. With proper choice
      of material for the wire(s), (e.g., similar to materials used in
      maintenance-free auto batteries) bubbles (electrolysis) are
      virtually absent.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Further Detail</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0057] One objective during development was to lay groundwork for
      an exemplary device that can separate salt and other solutes from
      water. To design such a device, we observed that solutes tend to
      be excluded from the zone adjacent to many hydrophilic surfaces.
      Solutes observed to be excluded ranged from micron-sized colloidal
      solutes, for example, down to small molecular weight dyes.
      Hydrophilic surfaces that exclude these solutes include various
      hydrogels and polymeric surfaces. Exclusion is seen not only in
      static situations but also when the aqueous suspension or solution
      flows in channels cut inside of gels, and this formed the basis
      for several implementations of the exemplary device.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] In one implementation, salt water, or otherwise
      contaminated water, flows into the gel or polymer channel, and the
      salt molecules progressively migrate from the wall toward the
      channel axis (center of the tube).<br>
      <br>
      [0059] This concentrated solution in the channel core is discarded
      or recycled, while the pure water in the annular region (i.e.,
      outer region of the tube lumen) is collected. Variations of the
      exemplary technique were tested under a series of experimental
      conditions, in order to optimize purification and throughput.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] In one implementation, as described above, we examined
      microspheres suspended in aqueous solution in the vicinity of
      hydrogel surfaces. The microspheres translated away from the
      surface, leaving a microsphere-free zone that was unexpectedly
      large relative to expectations of classical theory (Israelachvili,
      1992): depending on conditions, the microsphere-free zone was on
      the order of 100 µm or more. Because the depletion of microspheres
      from the vicinal zone left pure water, this principle can be
      applied to the separation of suspended or dissolved entities,
      including salt.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] An example of this kind of exclusion is shown in FIG. 6.
      The gel-water boundaries are the vertically oriented, thin, white
      lines. (The vertically oriented fuzzy band to the right of “gel”
      is an optical reflection artifact.) Microspheres migrated away
      from the gel surface, leaving, within minutes, a zone ~250 µm that
      was devoid of microspheres.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] FIG. 7 shows another example of exemplary solute exclusion.
      In FIG. 7, the exclusion-inducing surface is again NAFION. FIG. 7
      shows a time-dependent buildup of the solute exclusion zone, which
      typically grows in minutes to 0.5 mm or more.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] Our subsequent studies have shown the exemplary exclusion
      methods to be generally applicable. Exemplary exclusion was
      observed not only in the vicinity of a series of synthetic and
      natural hydrogels, but also near other hydrophilic surfaces
      including carboxylated monolayers, PEGylated surfaces, and
      biological surfaces (muscle and vascular endothelium). In various
      implementations, excluded species include microspheres of either
      charge polarity, red blood cells, ion-exclusion resin beads,
      fluorophore-labeled protein (albumin—as shown in FIG. 8), and
      various low molecular weight dyes. FIG. 9, for example, shows the
      time course for exclusion of the fluorophore, sodium fluorescein,
      in the vicinity of NAFION.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] In both cases in FIGS. 8 and 9, these relatively low
      molecular weight solutes are excluded at least qualitatively by an
      amount similar to the much larger colloidal microspheres. Thus,
      the size range of excluded species can be broad—from micron-sized
      particles down to small molecules. All of these solutes,
      suspensions, etc., are excluded from vicinal water, presumably by
      some surface induced alteration of that water. In one
      implementation, we derived evidence that at least three physical
      features of the vicinal water are different from bulk water: NMR
      hydrogen nuclei relaxation times; ability to support sustained
      potential difference; and sharply diminished infrared radiation
      from the vicinal water zone.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] Considering the broad size range of solutes confirmed to be
      excluded (12 orders of magnitude in mass), molecules beyond this
      range, i.e., even smaller than the lowest molecular weight dyes
      (e.g., mol. wt. 376) can be excluded as well.<br>
      <br>
      [0066] In some experiments, we built polyacrylic acid gels (also
      some polyvinyl alcohol gels) containing long, cylindrical
      channels, as shown in FIG. 10. Solute-containing water is pumped
      through the channel; or, in the case of a vertically oriented
      channel, the suspension can flow by the force of gravity; external
      power is then unnecessary. At the entry, the solute is distributed
      uniformly over the cross-section. Farther along the channel, the
      solute can be progressively excluded from the zone just inside the
      gel. With sufficient tube length, the sub-annular region will be
      solute free for practical purposes, or, actually solute free given
      a theoretically long enough tube.<br>
      <br>
      [0067] This solute-free water can then be collected using an
      annular channel 1002 whose outer diameter 1004 is equal to the
      inner diameter of the gel (FIG. 10, right side). The
      solute-containing water in the collection zone 1008 is in the
      center, i.e., inside the annular solute-free zone being collected
      by the annular channel 1002. When the solute-containing water is
      in short supply (e.g., the solute is precious), the
      solute-containing water can be recovered, so that the process can
      be repeated in cascading stages.<br>
      <br>
      [0068] As shown in FIG. 11, some initial studies were carried out
      using 1-µm carboxylate microspheres, easily detectable with a
      compound microscope. Polyacrylic acid gels were molded to contain
      a cylindrical channel, 1.6 mm in diameter 50 mm long. Using a
      motor-driven syringe, suspensions of microspheres were driven
      through the channel. Because the gel was clear, the microspheres
      within the channel could be easily visualized. Clear, stable,
      exclusion zones increased with time (and increased faster with
      smaller molecular weight substances; see FIGS. 8 and 9), and grew
      to appreciable size at distances sufficiently far from the entry
      orifice. From the left, FIG. 11 shows the time course of
      microsphere distribution 45 mm from entry point at various times
      after exposure to suspension. The gel boundary is the dark region
      at top. At this low magnification, microspheres are seen as small,
      uniform dots. On the right in FIG. 11 is seen microsphere
      distribution and growing exclusion zone ten minutes after
      exposure, at successive locations (10 mm, 25 mm, and 45 mm) along
      the channel.<br>
      <br>
      [0069] In one implementation, the “solute” is pathogens, to be
      concentrated for easier identification. Thus, although an
      exemplary system can be used to separate salt from water, it can
      also be useful for separating contaminants from water.<br>
      <br>
      [0070] One advantage of the exemplary differential extractor 100
      is its simplicity. Once designed, it can be manufactured
      inexpensively, easy to keep functional, and simple to use.
      Portable units may operate without supply of external electrical
      power—by using gravity flow. In geographical regions of scarce
      water supply, gray water, e.g., from a shower, can be recycled,
      making an exemplary apparatus useful in special environments, such
      as space vehicles or submarines, where water is in short supply.<br>
      <br>
      [0071] NAFION constitutes a powerful exclusion-generating surface
      in static situations, and may be superior for some applications to
      gels used to obtain results in flow situations such as that of
      FIG. 10. NAFION, a durable material, is widely used in fuel-cell
      applications, and can be micro-machined to contain arrays of micro
      fluidic channels for quick and effective separation.<br>
      <br>
      [0072] In pursuing salt separation, one challenge is detection of
      differences in concentration of ionic species. While microspheres
      are detectable under bright field microscopy and fluorophores are
      detectable under fluorescence microscopy, direct measurements of
      salt concentration may require sampling of the fluids. One
      implementation uses a small cylindrical tube inserted near to and
      parallel to the (polyacrylic gels or NAFION) excluding surface. To
      prevent premature capillary action while the tube is being
      positioned, the distal end of the tube can be temporarily sealed.
      Once the tube is in place, the seal is removed; then fluid flows
      by capillary action (or can be drawn by a pump if necessary) and
      collected for later analysis using an osmometer.<br>
      <br>
      [0073] In one implementation, the exclusion surfaces of an
      exemplary differential extractor 100 were obtained as follows.
      Convenient samples of NAFION are 180-µm-thick sheets, which can be
      cut for experiments. Polyacrylic acid (PAAc) can be synthesized in
      the laboratory. For example, a solution can be prepared by
      diluting 30 ml of 99% acrylic acid with 10 ml deionized water.
      Then, 20 mg N,N'-ethylenebisacrylamide is added as a cross-linking
      agent, and 90 mg potassium persulfate is added as an initiator.
      The solution is vigorously stirred at room temperature until all
      solutes are completely dissolved, and then introduced into a
      chamber 1.5 mm high, in which a 1-mm glass rod, later removed for
      cylindrical channel experiments, is suspended at mid-height.
      Gelation takes place as the temperature is slowly raised to about
      70° C. The temperature is then maintained at 80° C. for one hour
      to ensure complete gelation. Synthesized gels are carefully
      removed from the capillary tubes, rinsed with deionized water, and
      stored in a large volume of deionized water, refreshed daily, for
      one week.<br>
      <br>
      [0074] Controls can be carried out first to ensure that collection
      of fluid by the tube—or even the presence of the tube itself—does
      not interfere with the exclusion zone. One technique is to monitor
      the exclusion-zone boundary by optical microscopy, using
      microspheres (1 µm, carboxylate) as markers. Since the
      microspheres can be easily visualized, this method also permits
      the detection of any convective flows. If the tube itself
      compromises the zone, different materials can be used as
      alternates. Slow withdrawal of fluid from the exclusion zone
      typically does not induce much disturbance; however, if any
      disturbance is noted, the collection rate can be slowed until the
      disturbance becomes negligibly small, the tradeoff being increased
      time required for collection.<br>
      <br>
      [0075] To sample from a broader, more representative zone, the
      tube can be steadily but gently withdrawn parallel to the
      exclusion surface during collection. Again, it may be important to
      test in the same way as above whether withdrawal disturbs the
      exclusion zone, and if necessary, collected samples can be
      analyzed for microsphere contamination.<br>
      <br>
      [0076] Once the controls confirm the stability of a given
      implementation, additional controls can be carried out to test the
      efficacy of sampling. These tests can be carried out on NAFION and
      polyacrylic acid surfaces exposed to aqueous solutions of small
      molecular weight dyes. Dyes are ordinarily separated out
      satisfactorily. It is useful to confirm the absence of dye from
      drawn samples of different volume. These samples can be compared
      against standards in a fluorimeter. This helps to establish the
      size of sample volumes required to avoid contamination in the
      salt-exclusion processes.<br>
      <br>
      [0077] Next, exclusion of salt can be tested. NaCl concentration
      can be 100 mM to start. The region of the exclusion zone
      immediately adjacent to the excluding surface can be sampled
      first, as this is the region within which salt should be most
      profoundly excluded. Samples drawn from this region can be tested
      using osmometry. Next, a micrometer drive can be used to translate
      the tube to a position ~100 µm more distant from the surface, and
      samples can again be collected. The protocol can be repeated at
      100 µm intervals in order to obtain a profile of [NaCl] vs.
      distance from the excluding surface. A priori, in one
      implementation, undetectably low concentrations continue for a
      distance of several hundred micrometers, followed by a rapid
      falloff at roughly 0.5 mm from the surface. If increased
      measurement resolution seems warranted, smaller collection tubes
      can be used, and spatial increments can be reduced.<br>
      <br>
      [0078] Separation can be implemented at different NaCl
      concentrations ranging from 1 mM up to 1 M (ordinary seawater is
      0.4 M to 0.45 M). If increased detection sensitivity is required
      for low concentrations, atomic absorption spectrometry can be used
      instead of osmometry—several atomic absorption spectrometers are
      satisfactory for use. We have noted a diminution of exclusion-zone
      size with salt concentration, ~40% reduction as [NaCl] rose from
      nominally zero to 100 mM; hence, with the addition of salt there
      is a more rapid falloff of separation efficacy with distance from
      the excluding surface.<br>
      <br>
      [0079] The separation of salts other than NaCl is possible too, as
      water often contains a variety of salts other than NaCl, albeit in
      lower quantity. The exclusion-zone size may be compromised by
      different salts in different ways; i.e., reduction of
      exclusion-zone size depends on the salt's position in the
      Hofmeister series, K+&gt;Na+&gt;Li+&gt;Ca2+. It can be useful to
      verify these preliminary observations systematically, and then
      test the efficacy of separation of each one of them. Ideally, they
      can be separated with much the same efficacy of NaCl; however if
      these salts compromise the exclusion zone sufficiently, then
      collection parameters may need to be adjusted.<br>
      <br>
      [0080] Other relevant variables that may be important to test for
      their ultimate practical value include above all, temperature and
      pH. The former can be evaluated by using a temperature-controlled
      stage during salt-separation tests, while the latter can be
      evaluated by adding HCl or NaOH to vary the pH between 3 and 12
      with continuous pH monitoring. The optimum result reveals the
      absence of any strong dependence of either of these variables on
      efficacy of separation; however, a noted dependence can be
      compensated for in the implementation.<br>
      <br>
      [0081] In one implementation, the exemplary technique removes
      sea-salts from seawater. In one process, Puget Sound seawater
      (Na+=410 mM) was used, and tests were carried out as above. The
      goal was Na&lt;+&gt; removal effective enough to reach EPA
      drinking-water standards (20 mg/l, or around 0.9 mM)
      (http://www.epa.gov/safewater/ccl/sodium.html).<br>
      <br>
      [0082] In another implementation, the exemplary technique
      separates bacteria and viruses from the aqueous mixture, for
      decontamination applications, in much the same way as salt
      separation was accomplished above.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Detail of Pathogen Separation</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0083] Common bacteria have a size in the micrometer range, some
      larger; hence, they are detectable by optical microscopy, most
      clearly using phase or DIC microscopy. Viruses elude practical
      detection by optical microscopy; hence, they can be labeled with a
      fluorophore and detected by fluorescence microscopy. Excluding
      surfaces can be the same as those used above, polyacrylic-acid
      gels, and NAFION. Similar collection strategies as used above can
      be used in this application. Various common bacteria and viruses
      were considered, limited to non-pathogenic varieties such as
      heat-inactivated samples that require no special facilities.
      Bacteria include: Escherichia coli (HB101) and Pseudomonas
      aeruginosa purchasable from American Type Culture Collection
      (Manassas, Va., USA). Viruses include adenovirus, SV40, and
      influenza available from Virapur (San Diego, Calif., USA). These
      can be fluorophore labeled.<br>
      <br>
      [0084] Different implementations may vary the conditions used for
      removing the pathogens. The pH can be varied from 3 to 12 with
      NaOH and HCl with continuous pH monitoring, and runs can be
      carried out at each pH value. Salt concentration can be varied
      from the low level of pure water, all the way up to molar values.
      Temperature can be varied too, as described above.<br>
      <br>
      [0085] In the case of bacteria, and unlike salt, because the
      exclusion zone is visually detectable, the exemplary technique can
      measure not only the extent of exclusion, but also the rate at
      which the exclusion zone develops.<br>
      <br>
      [0086] These measurements are performed by abruptly exposing the
      exclusion surface to a suspension of bacteria, and tracking the
      time course of exclusion zone development. Such dynamic
      measurements are important features to bear in mind when a
      particular exemplary purification system is designed. Another
      aspect to keep in mind is measurement of separation dynamics
      during flow in cylindrical tubes (FIG. 10, above).<br>
      <br>
      [0087] Having established the basic exclusionary features,
      including how much each type of solute is excluded and the
      magnitudes of the respective exclusion zones, the next step is to
      exploit those features in an implementation. A basic starting
      point is the implementation of microsphere separation during flow
      in cylindrical channels that was discussed above.<br>
      <br>
      [0088] In one implementation, the channels are easily made: the
      gel is molded to contain a cylindrical glass rod, which is removed
      once the gel has set. In the case of NAFION, tubular samples with
      diameter ~0.5 nm can be obtained from the supplier. Because the
      NAFION wall is thin, visualizing particles or fluorescence within
      the channel should engender no serious difficulty.<br>
      <br>
      [0089] A syringe pump is used to drive suspensions through the
      channel. (Improved versions of the pump can eliminate residual
      pulsations and result in higher precision measurements.) For test
      purposes, a sample may be placed on a microscope stage, flow is
      imposed by the pump, and the distribution of microspheres is
      measured at different times at a single location, and at different
      positions along the channel. Such tests reveal the time- and
      distance-dependence of exclusion prior to manufacture of the
      implementation.<br>
      <br>
      [0090] Measurements such as those just described can be carried
      out on different solutes. Knowing the size of the exclusion zone
      in static situations (FIGS. 6-9) will shortcut the number of
      trials (e.g., flow rate, channel diameter and length, etc.)
      required to establish reasonable parameters such as flow rate for
      separation of salt, as well as for separation of pathogens.<br>
      <br>
      [0091] For effective exclusion, different solutes may require
      different physical and geometric exclusion parameters. However, it
      may turn out that a particular set of parameters is acceptable for
      the exclusion not only of salt(s), but also of a range of
      pathogenic substances. In such a case, it may be possible to
      remove all of these in a single filtration pass, without requiring
      multiple stages. FIG. 12 shows a system for collecting purified
      water, i.e., a fixture designed to collect effluent from a gel
      separation channel. The collection system is designed to interface
      with the exit of the gel-separation unit; in FIG. 10, it
      corresponds to the collection zone 1008 on the right. The design
      in FIG. 12 involves a double cylinder, for collection of annular
      (solute-free) and core (solute-containing) flows; similar to that
      of FIG. 10. An initial design of the unit in FIG. 12 can be made
      using thin-walled stainless steel tubing. The interface end of the
      apparatus may be inserted into the end of the gel or NAFION
      channel. The inner tube or “waste outlet” is designed to catch the
      solute-containing fluid, and is connected to an exit tube, which
      either discards the fluid, or saves it for recycling. The annular
      ring between the inner and outer tube extracts the purified water,
      which flows out through a side-exit port for collection.<br>
      <br>
      [0092] For both fractions, pumps may be useful to facilitate more
      rapid flow. Dimensions and materials for effective water
      collection devices may be optimized. The size of the inner
      cylinder is sometimes critical in ensuring that the maximum
      quantity of salt or impurity is removed. This follows for two
      reasons: (i) the salt-containing zone of the separator may need to
      project entirely within the collector's inner cylinder; and, (ii)
      the exclusion zone might not exclude uniformly, so that, for
      example, regions at low radius just beyond the salt-containing
      zone may still contain some amounts of salt whereas regions at
      larger radius may be truly salt free. Cylinder diameter can be
      carefully tested for each solute of interest. Thus, using a set
      “standard” for gel-channel conditions, collection ducts with a
      series of internal diameters can be tested to check for optimum
      efficacy.<br>
      <br>
      [0093] It is also useful to check a series of materials other than
      stainless steel, including various nonreactive metals and
      polymers, as it is not clear a priori whether a hydrophilic or
      hydrophobic material will result in optimum collection. Water must
      flow freely into the tube; yet it should not stick excessively to
      the tube's walls. Hence some combination of hydrophilic and
      hydrophobic properties may be necessary to optimize the ability to
      collect. One important consideration can be the collection speed
      in the absence of vacuum pumping. This can be important in an
      effort to make the system independent of the need for external
      power.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Optimizing an Exemplary System</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0094] If drinking water is to be filtered from pathogenic
      substances, then testing should be done on ordinary drinking water
      to which pathogens have been added. If purification turns out not
      to be adequate in these situations, then backtracking can obtain
      adequate purification, e.g., by adding one solute at a time to
      pure water to determine which may be the “offending” agent.<br>
      <br>
      [0095] Testing can also achieve the optimum excluding material.
      Polyacrylic acid gels and NAFION are good candidates, because they
      produce abundant exclusion. However, these surfaces are not
      necessarily optimal for all solutes, and there are countless other
      materials that can be customized for various solutes. In
      particular, gels and polymers studied thus far have been neutral
      (polyvinyl alcohol) or negatively charged (e.g., polyacrylic
      acid). The one positively charged surface (aminated
      styrene-DVB-copolymer) explored briefly gave positive results.
      Hence, in some cases positively charged gels (e.g., chitosan) may
      exclude both pathogenic substances and salt. In such a case,
      systematic studies including pH dependence can be carried out for
      optimizing the excluding material. In some instances,
      complementarity exists between negatively charged and positively
      charged surfaces, and the most effective separation may include
      one layer of each, or some spatial surface arrangement of
      positively and negatively charged regions.<br>
      <br>
      [0096] Surfaces to be utilized may include functionalized
      monolayers (SAMS). Monolayer results obtained with exposed
      carboxyl groups showed ample exclusion of carboxylate
      microspheres. The ability to functionalize surfaces opens many
      possibilities in terms of ultimate manufacture.<br>
      <br>
      [0097] In one implementation, the system is as independent of
      external electrical power as possible. It is also beneficial to
      balance purification efficacy with rapid throughput. Rapid
      throughput implies diminishing drag during flow through narrow
      channels. In one implementation, the friction in tubes lined with
      certain block co-polymers is massively diminished—by as much as
      three orders of magnitude (Raviv et al., 2003). If these polymers,
      e.g., PMMA-PSGMA, are also found to create exclusion zones for a
      given solute, then it is possible to achieve reasonable solute
      separation, while at the same time achieving substantially
      enhanced throughput as a result of lowered resistance—driven only
      by the force of gravity. In that situation, the system can operate
      much like a household water filter, with simple gravity-driven
      flow.<br>
      <br>
      [0098] In one implementation, an exemplary apparatus is created
      through microfabrication. If the optimum channel size is in the
      range of hundreds of microns or less, then microfabrication can
      create arrays of channels. An example is shown in FIG. 13. The top
      of FIG. 13 is oriented upward, and the rectangles represent the
      excluding surfaces. The unpurified water enters at the top, and as
      it proceeds downward, the exclusion zone grows.<br>
      <br>
      [0099] The contaminated water (stippled) exits at the bottom
      through a connecting channel. The purified water (clear) enters a
      collecting duct (broad “U” in diagram). Because identical,
      slab-like units are stacked upon one another, the U-shaped ducts
      create channels oriented normal to the plane of the diagram.
      Purified water is collected at the ends of those channels. Slight
      tilt out of the plane of the paper can bias the flow in one or the
      other direction, facilitating collection.<br>
      <br>
      [0100] The exemplary array of FIG. 13 can operate purely by
      gravitational force or by pumps to facilitate flow.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Exemplary Methods</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0101] FIG. 14 shows a representative exemplary method 1400 of
      separating components of aqueous mixtures. In the flow diagram,
      the operations are summarized in individual blocks. The exemplary
      method 1400 may be performed by hardware, such as the exemplary
      differential extractor 100.<br>
      <br>
      [0102] At block 1402, an aqueous mixture (suspension, solution,
      etc.), is flowed over a hydrophilic surface, i.e., an exclusion
      surface, or in some cases a hydrophobic surface. Example materials
      for such an exclusion surface are certain gels, polymers; NAFION,
      etc.<br>
      <br>
      [0103] At block 1404, purified water can be collected in a first
      region near the hydrophilic surface. The exemplary differential
      extractor 100 may have an annular tube that lifts only the
      purified water.<br>
      <br>
      [0104] At block 1404, one or more concentrated non-aqueous
      components of the aqueous mixture may be collected in a second
      region beyond the first region of the purified water, with respect
      to the exclusion surface. The exemplary differential extractor 100
      may have a center or core tube that draws the concentrated
      non-aqueous components from the apparatus.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Alternative Implementation</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0105] In an alternate implementation, it has been found that
      solutes were excluded from a region just below the top surface of
      water, at the air-water interface. With a chamber (or tank) made
      from two large flat pieces of glass separated by 3 mm, a
      microsphere suspension was added, and the chamber was viewed
      facing one of the glass pieces. The zone just beneath the surface
      began to clear. Within 30 minutes a 2-mm zone (herein referred to
      as an exclusion zone) was fully devoid of microspheres. The
      exclusion zone remained devoid of microspheres for many hours.
      This was not the result of microsphere settling, which took place
      at approximately 24 hours after filling the chamber.<br>
      <br>
      [0106] Other implementations to create water separation in an
      aqueous solution are described in an article titled “Cylindrical
      phase separation in colloidal suspensions,” by Kate Ovchinnikova
      and Gerald H. Pollack (accepted for publication in Physical Review
      E by the American Physical Society, January, 2009), which is
      hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
      <br>
      [0107] An example diagram 150 of a tank 151 including an aqueous
      solution with an air layer, a meniscus layer, and bulk water,
      which may contain microspheres and is thus labeled
      “water+microspheres.” The clear zone, corresponds to the exclusion
      zone 152 is shown in FIG. 15. The exclusion zone 152 has
      characteristics similar to the exclusion zones described above.
      When the aqueous solution contains microsphere markers, not only
      does the zone 152 exclude those microspheres, but also its upper
      region has negative potential, much like exclusion zones. Further
      the solution remains at constant width even as the upper surface
      of water is lifted and moved from side to side with a vertically
      oriented charged rod. Hence, this zone 152 is mechanically
      cohesive, much like exclusion zones.<br>
      <br>
      [0108] The tank 151 may be used for establishing a volume of an
      aqueous mixture having a surface. In addition an apparatus
      collects water at the surface of an aqueous mixture. The apparatus
      may establish an exclusion zone 152 with a depth in the aqueous
      mixture. In one implementation, the apparatus may collect water at
      the surface when the depth of the aqueous mixture is greater than
      approximately four times the depth of the exclusion zone 152,
      although any depth may be suitable provided the depth of the
      aqueous mixture is greater than the depth of the exclusion zone.
      The aqueous mixture may include a mixture of water, particles and
      solutes and includes particles and solutes whose removal is
      desired. In one implementation the depth of the exclusion zone 152
      is about 2 mm.<br>
      <br>
      [0109] A collection apparatus including a tube may collect water
      and transfer the collected water from a tank 151 to a collecting
      chamber. The collection apparatus may stop collecting when the
      water in the exclusion zone 152 has been fully transferred from
      the tank 151 to the collecting chamber. An apparatus may also be
      provided to admit more mixture to the tank 151 to let the
      exclusion zone 152 build for later collection.<br>
      <br>
      [0110] In another implementation a skimming apparatus (as
      generally known) that includes the tube may continuously skim the
      exclusion-zone water on the surface of the aqueous solution or
      aqueous mixture. A controller to the skimmer may be provided to
      adjust the collection rate from the tank 151 to a collection
      chamber so that a rate of buildup of water in the exclusion zone
      152 and collection of water reach a steady state.<br>
      <br>
      [0111] The presence of a solute-exclusion zone at the upper
      surface of water provides an environment in which water can be
      skimmed off to provide purified water.<br>
      <br>
      [0112] In one flow embodiment, a tank's 151 upper zone is
      connected through a downward slanted tube to a lower collecting
      chamber. A valve opens periodically to allow flow from tank 151 to
      collecting chamber to occur. The tank 151 is then replenished with
      the aqueous solution.<br>
      <br>
      [0113] In another embodiment, an upper zone in tank 151 is set up
      similar to the flow embodiment except that a pump is used to
      facilitate withdrawal of the top layer.<br>
      <br>
      [0114] In another embodiment, the upper zone of the tank 151 is
      set up similar to the flow embodiment except that multiple stages
      are used to achieve further purification.<br>
