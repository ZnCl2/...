      is an independent company founded in 2005 by Greenlight Energy
      Resources, Inc. In partnership with Oregon State University, the
      company is engaged in the development and commercialization
      of&nbsp; wave energy harvesting devices using novel, off-shore,
      direct-drive permanent-magnet generator topologies.<br>
      <br>
      Greenlight Energy Resources, Inc. was formed by the principals of
      the Greenlight Energy, Inc. (GEI) following the sale of their wind
      energy company to BP Alternative Energy North America, Inc. (Press
      Release) At the time of the sale in 2006, GEI was one of the
      largest independent wind energy companies in the country with a
      6,000 MW development pipeline comprised of large-scale wind energy
      projects in 15 states. By year-end 2007, over $700 million of wind
      energy facilities developed by GEI were operational, including a
      $500 million facility in Colorado being completed this year by BP.<br>
      <br>
      Columbia’s management team combines energy industry, engineering,
      legal, and technology commercialization experience, and is well
      prepared to be a leader in the field of ocean energy.<br>

      Columbia is developing technologies that will generate energy
      between one and three miles offshore - where the available wave
      energy is greatest. We believe that <span style="font-weight:
        bold;">direct drive systems, which avoid the use of pneumatic
        and hydraulic conversion steps, are more efficient, more
        reliable and easier to maintain, and are therefore the most
        likely to deliver the lowest cost of energy</span>. Our research
      path focuses on:<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Point absorbers</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Direct coupling of the wave
        motion to the generator</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Innovative use of permanent
        magnets and other highly-efficient components</span><br

      <br>
      CORVALLIS, Ore.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Columbia Power Technologies,
      Inc. (www.columbiapwr.com), a leading renewable energy company in
      Oregon that is commercializing its wave energy conversion
      technology, has successfully deployed its first SeaRay prototype
      in Puget Sound. These sea trials represent a key milestone in
      moving from the pre-commercial stage toward commercial viability.
      Additionally, the closing of Columbia Power’s recent private
      capital signifies excellent validation of the company’s vision and
      technical development capabilities.<br>
      <br>
      “Our task is to demonstrate to utilities and independent power
      producers that we can help them deliver power predictably,
      reliably, and at a cost that is competitive. At this stage, we are
      making this happen in a very rapid and capital-efficient manner.”<br>
      <br>
      “The clear progress we have made in our technology readiness has
      been accomplished as a result of an outstanding team of engineers
      and partners,” said Bradford Lamb, president and COO of Columbia
      Power Technologies, Inc. “With the support of the U.S. Department
      of Energy, the U.S. Navy, and the Oregon Congressional Delegation
      and by following a disciplined technology development roadmap, we
      are able to accelerate our commercialization path.”<br>
      <br>
      The device, code-named SeaRay, represents <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">the first wave power technology of
        its kind and is capable of extracting up to twice the amount of
        energy from ocean waves compared with other technologies under
        development. Additionally, this unique design is able to produce
        power in adverse sea conditions, allowing higher and more energy
        conversion throughout the year.</span> Columbia Power
      Technologies’ goal is to deliver megawatt-scale devices, capable
      of operating in the widest range of temperate zone coastal load
      centers around the globe.<br>
      <br>
      “The SeaRay is performing beyond our expectations and tracking
      well with modeling predictions,” said Reenst Lesemann, CEO of
      Columbia Power Technologies. “Our task is to demonstrate to
      utilities and independent power producers that we can help them
      deliver power predictably, reliably, and at a cost that is
      competitive. At this stage, we are making this happen in a very
      rapid and capital-efficient manner."<br>
      <br>
      Columbia Power Technologies’ vision was to develop a simpler, more
      reliable and more efficient device — the SeaRay accomplishes this
      through its<span style="font-weight: bold;"> heave- and
        surge-energy capture design</span>, accessing the full potential
      of the wave. This innovative approach is a breakthrough in wave
      energy technology because it can survive and produce electricity
      in extreme weather conditions, is more dependable, and is easier
      to maintain, all the while generating a <span style="font-weight:
        bold;">smaller environmental footprint</span> than other
      renewable energy solutions. To see the SeaRay in action, please

      <br>
      The world’s oceans are estimated to contain enough practically
      extractable energy to provide over 6,000 terawatt hours of
      electricity each year, which is enough to power over 600 million
      homes and is worth over $900 billion annually.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract</span> -- An apparatus
      and method for converting wave energy using the relative
      rotational movement between two interconnected float assemblies
      and the relative rotational movement between each of the float
      assemblies and a spar which extends from a connection with the
      float assemblies at the water surface into the water. <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Background of Invention</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0002] The present invention relates to the extraction of energy
      from water waves found in oceans or other large bodies of water
      and, in particular, the conversion of wave energy into electrical
      energy. Water waves that form in large bodies of water contain
      kinetic and potential energy that the device and methodology of
      the present invention is designed to extract. More specifically,
      the object of the present invention is to provide structures and
      methods to efficiently convert the hydrodynamic surge (horizontal
      component) and heave (vertical component) of ocean wave energy
      into rotary shaft motion for use in direct drive rotary
      generation.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Summary of Invention</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0003] We describe a unique approach for converting wave motion to
      mechanical rotary motion. A wave energy converter (WEC) that
      extracts energy from both the heave and surge energy contained in
      an ocean wave so as to allow for twice the energy extraction
      potential of other systems that only extract energy from heave
      motion in the waves. [0004] We also describe a wave energy
      converter that provides a wave to rotary energy . approach that
      will work with a DDR generator or any other power take off (PTO)
      driven by a mechanical rotary drive shaft. The system may allow,
      but is not limited to, the use of large diameter, high torque and
      low speed direct driven rotary (DDR) generators in wave energy
      applications and may allow for a more cost effective and efficient
      conversion of wave energy as compared to other methods of
      conversion. [0005] We also describe a method by which the ocean
      wave forces can be coupled to create low speed high torque
      rotation. This rotation can then be coupled to the DDR generator
      or other PTO. This PTO may include all forms of rotary power
      conversion, such as a large direct driven rotary electric
      generator, a gear box driven electric generator, a belt driven
      electric generator, water pumping systems, water desalination,
      pneumatic pumping systems and even hydraulic pumps, and similar
      devices.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] The structure and methodology includes mechanical
      implementations that, among other things, allow for an increase in
      the rotary speed of the main drive shaft. They also provide for
      methods of implementation that increase the magnetic flux velocity
      in the generator air gap.<br>

        Invention:</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0010] A wave energy converter 10, shown in FIG. 1, is comprised
      of a fore float 11 and an aft float 12. These floats 1 1, 12 are
      rotably attached to spar 13. The floats 1 1, 12 are attached
      through drive, shafts 18 and 19 (shown in FIG. 3) to a mechanical
      rotary system that utilizes the speed or torque to perform
      mechanical work (electric generation, water pumping, or similar
      function). As seen in FIG. 1, the outer body is comprised of three
      components: the spar 13; the fore float 11; and the aft float 12.
      The floats 11 and 12 are connected together by bearing shafts 16
      and 17 (the latter of which is shown in FIG. 3) such that fore
      float 11 and aft float 12 can rotate relative to each other.
      [0011] Water waves 20 are comprised of rotational particle motions
      that are grossly depicted in FIG. 2, heave, which creates vertical
      up force 21 and vertical down force 22 on bodies exposed to the
      wave, and surge which creates horizontal force 23, that a wave
      imparts to a body. The magnitude of the rotational forces 22 and
      23, depicted in FIG. 2, are highest at the water's surface, and
      diminish as the water depth increases. The floats 11 and 12 of
      FIG. 1 experience vertical forces due to the heave of wave 20.
      [0012] In FIG. 3, the floats 11 and 12 interconnect through
      bearing shafts 16 and 17 so as to permit relative movement between
      them. Driveshaft 19 connects float 11 to driveshaft flange 31 by
      passing through a motor housing 30 mounted to the top of spar 13.
      Rotation between the driveshaft 19 and motor housing 30 is
      accommodated by a sealed spar bearing 33. The sealed spar bearing
      33 permits rotation of driveshaft 19 relative to housing 30 but
      keeps water out of the motor housing 30. In similar fashion,
      driveshaft 18 connects float 12 to driveshaft flange 32 by passing
      through motor housing 30. Rotation between the driveshaft 19 and
      motor housing 30 is accommodated by sealed spar bearing 34, which
      also seals the housing 30 so as to keep out water. Driveshaft
      flange 31 is mounted to a stator assembly of a generator and
      driveshaft flange 32 is mounted to a rotor assembly of a
      generator. Alternatively, driveshaft flanges 31 can connect to a
      rotor assembly of a first generator and driveshaft flange 32 can
      connect to a rotor assembly of a second generator, with the stator
      of each being fixedly mounted inside motor housing 30. In one
      embodiment, two 80 ton generators are employed.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] As shown in FIG. 3, the float surface area is maximized by
      staggering the fore float 1 1 and aft float 12 about an axis of
      rotation. The bearing shaft 17 and bearing shaft 16 of FIG. 3 are
      axis centric on opposite sides of wave energy converter 10. The
      placement of these bearing shafts allow for only relative
      rotational motion about the axis between the fore float 11 an aft
      float 12. While this approach of coupling the fore float 11 and
      aft float 12 with a bearing system that is independent of the spar
      is not essential for function of the system, it allows for
      reduction of forces on the spar bearings 33 and 34. [0014] The
      spar heave plate 14 shown in FIG. 1 is exposed to smaller heave
      forces due to its depth below the water surface. The placement of
      that plate below the surface encourages the spar 13 to remain
      relatively stationary in the vertical direction and resist the
      vertical motion of the floats 11 and 12.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] A Power Take Off (PTO) can be mounted in the spar 13 or
      floats 11 and 12, and may be mounted in any location as
      appropriate for the specific design considerations. A first and
      second direct drive rotary generation PTO 35 and 36 are shown in
      FIG. 8, but any mechanical power transfer system such as a DDR
      generator (previously mentioned), a gear box driven electric
      generator, a belt driven electric generator, water pumping
      systems, water desalination, pneumatic pumping systems, even
      hydraulic pumps, or similar can be used.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] In one embodiment, the first PTO 35 is connected to drive
      shaft 19 through flange 31. The second PTO 36 is connected to
      drive shaft 18 through flange 32 (not shown in FIG 8). The
      relative rotational motion between the spar 13 and the floats 1 1
      and 12 drives the first and second PTO to convert wave motion to
      useable power. As described earlier, the pitching action of the
      spar (surge energy) and the pitching action of the float (heave
      energy) are combined to create a net sum that is complementary and
      produces a combined speed and force that is greater then the
      individual float or spar energies. This net energy is transferred
      to the PTO to perform work such as electrical generation, water
      pumping, air pumping, or similar effort.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] In another embodiment, a single PTO can be connected to
      drive shafts 18 and 19, such that a rotor (not shown) is attached
      to the fore float 1 1 and the stator is attached to the aft float
      12 (or visa- versa). The heave motion of this system creates
      relative rotational motion between the floats 11 and 12. By
      connecting the PTO only between the floats, the only energy
      captured is the energy from the relative motion between the
      floats. Hydrodynamic modeling has shown that the motion between
      the floats is increased by the addition of the spar system and its
      contribution of pitch heave response on the float bodies. However,
      an advantage to this arrangement is the increased rotary speeds
      and reduced generator costs. Because the stator and rotor are both
      . turned in opposite directions by the float motion, the relative
      speed between the rotor and stator is twice that of a spar mounted
      stator. It is well known in the art of generator design that
      increased speed, in general, allows for reduced cost.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] In another embodiment, two PTO' s can be mounted within
      housing 30, or mounted on the surface outside of the spar, encased
      in a water tight enclosure on the port and starboard sides of the
      system as shown in FIG. 9. In this second arrangement, PTO 37 has
      a rotor (not shown) attached to one float 11 and a stator (not
      shown) attached to the other float 12. The reverse is true of the
      PTO 38, which has a rotor (not shown) attached to float 12 and a
      stator (not shown) attached to float 11. Both PTO's are driven by
      the relative motion between the floats 11 and 12. The same
      advantage of increased generator speed is realized between stator
      and rotor, because each is being rotated in opposite directions.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] FIGS. 4A-4C depict various positions of the floats 11 and
      12 relative to each other and relative to spar 13 as different
      wave conditions are encountered by the wave energy converter 10.
      More specifically, FIG. 4A shows a situation in which the spar 13
      is essentially perpendicular to the horizon and float 11 and float
      12 have rotated downward. In FIG. 4B, floats 1 1 and 12 have
      rotated about bearing shaft 16 so as to be roughly horizontal
      while spar 13 has rotated off of the vertical position. In FIG.
      4C, float 11 has rotated clockwise, above the horizon, float 12
      has also rotated clockwise, but to an angle below the horizon,
      while spar 13 has rotated counterclockwise about seal bearings 33
      and 34. The movement of floats 11 and 12 and spar 13 being in
      reaction to wave forces acting upon them, with each movement
      leading to the potential conversion of wave energy by wave energy
      converter 10. Floats 11 and 12 will rotate up and down with each
      wave's incoming crest and trough, experiencing rotational motion
      with respect to the spar 13 due to heave forces acting on the
      floats.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] The floats 11 and 12 of FIG. 1, experience horizontal
      forces 21 and 22 due to wave surges shown in FIG. 2. The floats 11
      and 12 are allowed to rotate with respect to the spar 13. Figure
      4B depicts the floats 11 and 12, and spar 13 being pulled by surge
      forces to the right. The surge forces are minimal at the bottom of
      the spar 13 and at the heave plate 14. This difference in
      horizontal loading between the top of spar 13 and the bottom of
      that spar causes a moment about the spar body, so as to cause the
      spar to pitch right as depicted in FIG. 4B. The system is
      ballasted and designed to achieve a desired pivot point 15 on spar
      13, this pivot point affects the speed of the pitching action and
      the amount of power absorbed. The optimization of this pitching
      action is the designers' prerogative based on design priorities
      upon reading and understanding this disclosure, but ideally the
      pivot point 15 is between the motor housing 30 but above the heave
      plate 14. As the spar 13 pitches fore and aft, the spar 13 and
      floats 11 and 12 experience relative rotational motion.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] In both cases, surge and heave forces/the floats 11 and 12
      rotate about spar 13 with speed and torque to transmit power
      through drive shafts 18 and 19. The net affect of these heave and
      surge driven rotary motions is hypothesized and numerically
      modeled to be complementary (not opposing) in direction and force.
      The synthesis of these two motions is depicted in FIG. 4C, where
      it is shown that the net effect of both heave and surge forces
      will act on the wave energy converter 10 and that converter will
      absorb power from both modes (heave and surge) of wave motion. The
      system may work in either mode of operation to capture energy by
      using heave motion or surge motion as depicted, or both.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] As an electrical generating system, a reduced cost of
      energy (CoE) is expected to be an advantage over other approaches.
      The wave energy absorber has the potential to be half the size of
      a competing wave energy converter of the same power rating. That
      size reduction reduces capital costs and CoE. The CoE is further
      reduced by reducing the capital expenditure of the generator by
      optimizing the electromagnetic design using a large diameter
      generator when low-speed high-torque rotary motion is employed.
      Operating and maintenance costs are reduced by the systems
      operational design; there are minimal moving parts, and the parts
      that do move do so fluidly, with the incoming waves, so as to
      reduce the affect of snap loading often experienced by marine
      deployed bodies. This construction and approach reduces repair
      time and cost. The speed of rotation and driving torque are both
      increased by the extraction of both heave and surge energy. r
      Increasing the speed of body motions helps to reduce generator
      capital costs and the system components may be designed to satisfy
      this priority. In some methods described in this disclosure,
      reliability is improved by the elimination of all intermediate
      conversion stages. The WEC Survivability is another advantage of
      this system. The combined effect of the design results in a fluid
      motion of the wave converter in the ocean which reduces structural
      loading, reduces mooring loading, and accommodates for tidal
      variation. <br>
      <br>
      [0023] These methods described utilize rotary motion from a WEC to
      allow for a point absorber design that captures the heave and
      surge energy components of the incoming wave energy. By capturing
      both the surge and heave component, the maximum possible energy
      capture width of the wave energy device is [lambda]/[pi] (where
      [lambda] = wave length) as compared to [lambda]/2[pi] for a device
      that captures only the heave component. This improvement in
      capture width is expected to reduce the size and cost of the wave
      energy converter. The exact generator, pump, or rotary mechanisms
      for this application is not essential to the claims of this
      invention because it is applicable to any mechanism or system that
      is driven by a rotary shaft.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] In FIGS. 5 and 6, the spar 13 is shortened and the damper
      plate 9 is connected to the spar 13 using a cable or chain 31. The
      shortening of the spar allows for increased pitch motion and
      increased relative speed between float and spar in the surge mode
      of operation. The heave plate 14 connected through the cable 31
      still allows for heave reaction force in the heave mode of
      operation and allows the damper plate 9 to be lower in the water
      to increase the effectiveness of the damper plate operation. A
      shorter spar 13 also reduces the overall system cost, optimization
      of power absorption, and optimization of PTO speed, lowers the
      damper plate position and increases heave response. [0025] The
      spar 13 is designed to be relatively fixed in heave so that it
      resists the upward and downward heave motion of the floats. The
      spar 13 may also be designed such that it has a ballast chamber
      that varies the spar buoyancy between either positively buoyant
      when the wave trough is above the spar, or negatively buoyant when
      the wave crest is above the spar. Spar 13 is designed to
      transition between positive buoyancy and negative buoyancy, while
      maintaining the buoyancy to avoid sinking. This condition causes
      the heave motion of the spar 13 to move opposite (180 degrees out
      of phase) to the heave motion of floats 11 and 12. This diving and
      rising spar design is accomplished using a compressible ballast
      chamber in the lower section of the spar (not shown). When the
      wave crest is over spar 13, the higher pressure from the wave
      causes the ballast chamber to compress and causes the spar 13 to
      sink until the floats reach equilibrium buoyant state. Conversely,
      when the wave trough is over spar 13, the pressure on the buoyancy
      chamber is reduced, the ballast chamber expands, and spar 13 rises
      until the floats 11 and 12 reach an equilibrium buoyant state with
      the spar 13. This diving and rising action amplifies the range of
      motion between floats 11 and 12 and spar 13, and can be used to
      improve the wave converter performance. Additionally, it has been
      shown that proper ballast location in the spar can increase
      captured power and can also be used to optimize relative speed
      between the spar and floats.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] A challenge to proper operation of this system is the
      control of directionality. The power extraction efficiency is
      improved by proper orientation of floats 11 and 12 and the
      rotation axes with respect to the incoming wave front. Generally,
      performance is maximized when the axis of rotation is parallel to
      the incoming wave front, and minimized when the axis of rotation
      is perpendicular to the incoming wave front. Depending on the
      incident wave energy the system performance can be optimized and
      stabilized by changing the float orientation with respect to the
      incoming waves. It is recognized that in very energetic sea
      states, it may be desirable to decrease performance by changing
      the float orientation to a less efficient position.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] Directionality is affected by direction of water flowing
      past the device. The mean drift current of the incident wave
      climate is one source of current flow acting on the buoy. Another
      source of water flow acting on the body is the predominant ocean
      current acting on the buoy body. Wind acting on the buoy body
      above the water surface will also affect directionality.
      Directional vanes 39, shown in FIG. 10, can be used to channel
      water on the underside of floats 1 1 and 12. These vanes can be
      installed on the fore float 11, the aft 12, or both, depending on
      the preferred affect. Directional vanes 39 will cause floats 11
      and 12 to align with the direction of flow acting on them. As
      depicted in FIG. 10, the directional vanes 39 are shrouded by the
      outer hull of the floats. By shrouding the directional vanes 39,
      the directional effects from the wave action will be increased due
      to the wave acting from under the float body, while the effects
      from ocean current will be minimized. The size, length and aspect
      ratio of the directional vanes 39 may be varied to increase or
      decrease the magnitude of the effect of the vanes on
      directionality. Directional vanes 39 can alternatively be used on
      the aft float 12 only to provide a rudder effect to keep the
      device pointed into the wave.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] In another embodiment, a rudder 40, shown in FIG. 11 can be
      used to control float orientation in the wave. More than one
      rudder may also be used. The rudder may be positioned in all 360
      degrees of rotation. The rudder is statically positioned, manually
      controlled, or automatically controlled using existing technology
      similar to an automatic pilot used on numerous vessels. The
      control for the rudder takes into account the prevailing wave
      direction, prevailing currents, wind, and drift and sets the
      rudder to maintain the desired buoy direction.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] In another embodiment, a two point mooring system is used
      to control directionality. This system may be slack moored as
      depicted in FIG. 12. In FIG. 12, a slack mooring line 41 attaches
      to bearing shaft 16 and a second mooring line 42 attached to
      bearing shaft 17. A mechanism such as a chain winch 43, shown in
      FIG. 14, can be used to shorten or lengthen either mooring line.
      This will create a rotation on the float such that can be oriented
      in the desired direction.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] In another embodiment, a three point mooring system is used
      to control directionality. This system may be slack moored as
      depicted in FIG. 13. Mooring lines 41, 42 and 44 can attach to the
      heave plate 14 of converter 10 by conventional means. In one
      embodiment, mooring lines 41 and 42 form a common connection point
      to the heave plate 14 through a chain winch 43 as shown in FIG.
      14. By adjusting the direction of chain as shown in FIG. 14, the
      heave plate 14 can be forced to rotate into the desired direction
      so as to orient the converter 10 in the desired direction.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] In another embodiment, the top surface area of float 1 1
      and float 12 in FIG. 1 are covered with an array of solar panels
      52 and 53. This is of particular interest due to the large and
      un-blocked surface area that is in direct line of sight with the
      sun. Complementing the wave power with solar power provides for a
      more continuous power delivery from each WEC especially when wave
      energy is low during summer months.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] The geometry of system components can be optimized for use
      on different bodies of water during different seasons based on
      many factors. The floats 11 and 12 may be constructed with a
      narrow width to length ratio, or it might have a wide aspect
      ratio. Float geometry is optimized for wave height, wave period,
      seasonal wave spectral density, power capture, and directionality
      considerations. Float shape is not limited by the geometry
      depicted and may take on a more curved disc shape. The floats 1 1
      and 12 might also be cylindrical or rectangular in shape.
      Similarly, the diameter or length of the spar 13 may be altered
      for performance enhancements.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] Depending on the wave conditions, for example the distance
      between a wave peak and a wave trough, it may be advisable to
      separate floats 11 and 12, using adjustable arms as shown in
      FIG.17, alter the shape of the floats as shown in FIG. 16,
      re-orient the floats as shown in FIG. 17 and FIG. 18, add
      additional damper plates as shown in FIG. 19, or, in shallower
      waters, embed the spar in the sea floor.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] With regard to FIG. 16, it should be noted that the side
      profile of floats 11 and 12, shown here as a tear-dropped shape,
      can be mounted to arms 47 and 48, respectively, such that they can
      rotate about of center axis of the arms. The shape of the float is
      not limited. Float shape is to be optimized for hydrodynamic
      performance. These floats can include cylinders, squares,
      triangles and any combinations of curves. Nor is the rotation axis
      limited, but can be varied. The rotation of the floats changes the
      hydrodynamic performance, including water plain stiffness of the
      float, the float's center of gravity, and float free-board.
      Variable ballasting of floats 1 1 and 12 could provide additional
      hydrodynamic optimization.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] As shown in FIG. 17, the length of arms 47 and 48 can vary
      to suit the water conditions or to control the amount of energy
      being absorbed. In this embodiment of a wave energy converter,
      floats 11 and 12 are rotably connected to arms 47 and 48,
      respectively, via mounting 49 and 50, respectively. The yaw
      rotation of the floats allows the floats to rotate so as to be
      perpendicular to the axis of rotation of the PTO in housing 30.
      The floats can also rotate on arms 47 and 48 so as to be parallel
      with the axis of rotation of that PTO, or somewhere in between the
      parallel and perpendicular positions. Indeed, the orientation of
      the two floats can differ as shown in FIG. 17. The floats can be
      automatically or manually adjusted to control the amount of energy
      being absorbed from a wave.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] As shown in FIG. 18, it is also possible to add a rudder 51
      to the bottom of heave plate 14 in lieu of, or in addition to,
      directional vanes 39 of FIG. 10, rudder 40 of FIG. 11, or a
      combination of the two. Rudder 51 may be automatically or manually
      positioned to control the direction of the wave energy converter
      relative to the direction of wave travel. [0037] As shown in FIG.
      19, it is also possible to suspend a damper plate 52 from heave
      plate 14 to stabilize spar 13. For the same reason, it is also
      possible to suspend a damper plate 52 from damper plate 9, or a
      second heave plate (not shown) from heave plate 14, or a
      combination of these plates to stabilize the operation of the wave
      energy converter of the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] As can be readily understood from the foregoing description
      of the invention, the preferred structure and method of operation
      have been described, but other structures and approaches can be
      substituted therefore without departing from the scope of the
      invention.<br>
