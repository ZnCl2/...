      When I was forced to cease publishing the [ NATIONAL ] EXCHANGE
      last April I told all of you that I was working with an inventor
      who had a new synthetic fuel that utilized mostly water and
      vegetable oil. It's all true, and it's still developing.<br>
      <br>
      The inventor is David Townsend, a man with unusual insights in
      electrochemistry. I have known David personally for a number of
      years and I have been associated with him for the past two years,
      starting with my interest in his new coating.<br>
      <br>
      In a nutshell, Townsend found a way to make an alcohol-type fuel
      from low-cost, renewable ingredients without using more energy to
      manufacture than the fuel could produce. Essentially, the inventor
      utilized his vast knowledge of electroplating technology to form
      macromolecules or colloids from a combination of water, soybean
      oil, methanol, and certain activator chemicals. The first combo
      was with 90% water. This was later modified to using 80% water,
      10% vegetable oil, 7% methanol, and 3% activator chemicals. The
      process requires electroplating current and two distillations. To
      the best of our ability, we have computed that the energy
      conversion ratio is 3 BTU back for every BTU expended.<br>
      <br>
      The cost of a production facility was estimated to be about
      $50,000 in materials and one could produce a tank car of such fuel
      each day ( 6000 gallons). The cost of making the fuel, which was
      tested out at 85,000 BTU per gallon ( the same as 200 proof
      alcohol ) was said to be less than 40 cents per gallon.<br>
      <br>
      Too good to be true! That's the way it seemed at first. Then came
      the unexplained inconsistencies. Some batches in the 12-liter lab
      system were perfect, but others turned to water in a short time...
      why?<br>
      <br>
      At this writing Townsend has sought help from other chemists to
      solve the problem of the unstable batches. Energy department aid
      was sought, so far for naught, and papers were filed with the
      State of Illinois for a research grant into this promising new
      field. There are negotiations ongoing in North Carolina at this
      time and Doxa Fuels International has been formed around the new
      technology.<br>

      </b><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>1. Field of the Invention</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The present invention relates generally to the field of fuels and
      more particularly to a new and improved synthetic fuel.<br>
      <br>
      <b>2. Description of the Prior Art</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Prior to the present invention a variety of additives have been
      produced to be combined with gasoline to increase octane ratings.
      Many of such additives in turn became a source of unacceptable
      carbon monoxide, unburned hydrocarbons and nitrous oxides. In the
      effort to reduce consumption of petroleum it is known to combine
      195 proof ethanol as an extender with conventional gasoline,
      generally in a 10%-90% ratio.<br>
      <br>
      The ethanol-gasoline combination remains deficient in several
      respects. First, the ethanol is generally derived from otherwise
      useful feed grains such as corn. Second, the relatively low ratio
      utility of ethanol offers an inadequate displacement of gasoline.
      Third, the ethanol-gasoline combination is not significantly
      different from plain unleaded gasoline in terms of the generation
      of carbon monoxide, nitrous oxides and unburned hydrocarbons.
      Finally, ethanol is subject to phase separation from the gasoline
      in the presence of water.<br>
      <br>
      <b>OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      From the foregoing it will be understood that among the various
      objectives of the present invention are:<br>
      <br>
      to provide a new and novel synthetic fuel;<br>
      <br>
      to provide a fuel of the above-described character which may be
      combined with petroleum fuels in increased ratios;<br>
      <br>
      to provide a fuel of the above-described character which reduces
      the generation of carbon monoxide, unburned hydrocarbons and
      nitrous oxides; and<br>
      <br>
      to provide a fuel of the above-described character having improved
      stability.<br>
      <br>
      These other objectives of the present invention are efficiently
      achieved by linking methanol, butanol and a kerosene type oil into
      a stable long chain macro-molecule with a colloid stabilizer
      through distillation.<br>
      <br>
      The foregoing as well as other objects, features and advantages of
      the present invention will become more apparent from the following
      detailed description.<br>
      <br>
      <b>DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The applicant has discovered that by combining methanol (methyl
      alcohol), butanol (butyl alcohol) and a heavy hydrocarbon kerosene
      type oil (such as naptha) in the presence of a colloid stabilizer
      (magnesium laurel salts), a new and useful synthetic fuel may be
      very economically produced. He has further found that by varying
      the relative amounts of the three main ingredients the range of
      fuels from home heating oil, diesel fuel, automotive fuel and high
      performance aviation fuel may be obtained. For example, a fuel
      useful as a gasoline extender for automotive use is obtained by
      combining 40% naptha, 40% methanol and 20% butanol and adding
      0.001 pound of magnesium laurel salts per gallon. The mixture is
      heated in a reactor to a temperature of 300 degrees Fahrenheit and
      the resulting vapors are passed through a water cooled condenser.
      The liquid fuel is collected in a holding tank.<br>
      <br>
      A mixture of 25% synthetic fuel formulated as above with 75%
      unleaded gasoline and burned in a conventional automobile engine
      has been found to yield very substantial performance improvements
      from those of so-called "gasohol." More specifically, since the
      synthetic fuel has a substantial oxygen content, the stochiometric
      mixture of air to fuel is reduced from 14:1 to 4:1 and the
      production nitrous oxides is thereby substantially eliminated.
      Further, due to the high oxygen content of the synthetic fuel, the
      carbon content of the fuel is more completely oxidized in the
      combustion process yielding a higher amount of carbon dioxide and
      less carbon monoxide as well as substantially reduced unburned
      hydrocarbons in the exhaust gas.<br>
      <br>
      In blending the ethanol-gasoline fuel it is necessary to
      scrupulously avoid the introduction of water since a content of as
      little as 5% water will cause the two constituents to separate.
      With the applicant's invention the use of the magnesium laurel
      salts as a stabilizer provides a very strong colloidal molecular
      link between the synthetic fuel and the gasoline which prevents
      this phase separation. A further advantage arises in that the
      colloidal molecular link, once established, involves such strong
      electronic forces that when any part of the chain is ignited the
      entire chain tends to ignite and combustion is more complete
      leaving less residue to foul an engine or burner. A still further
      advantageous result is that the applicant's synthetic fuel does
      not exhibit the adverse effects on rubber and plastic engine
      components exhibited by gasoline either alone or in mixture with
      ethanol.<br>
      <br>
      The basic ingredients of the applicant's synthetic fuel are
      available in abundance from readily renewable sources. Methanol is
      economically produced by pyrolization of any organic matter
      including wood, garbage and sewage. Butanol is readily produced by
      fermentation of garbage, sewage or animal wastes using any one of
      a number of bacterial cultures. Naptha, as an inevitable
      by-product of the cracking process to produce gasoline from oil,
      is readily available and inexpensive. As an alternative to naptha,
      coal oil, vegetable oil or any other similar heavy hydrocarbon is
      useful in the practice of the applicant's invention. The term
      heavy hydrocarbon as used herein is defined as any hydrocarbon
      having sixteen or less carbon atoms and hydrogen atoms at least
      equal to the number of carbon atoms.<br>
      <br>
      The utility of a fuel; e.g. heating oil as opposed to aviation
      fuel, is determined in large measure by its flash point. The flash
      points of the three main ingredients of the applicant's synthetic
      fuel are naptha--155 to 160 degrees Fahrenheit; butanol--90
      degrees Fahrenheit; and methanol--42 degrees Fahrenheit. Thus,
      primarily by adjusting the methanol content the flash point of the
      synthetic fuel is adjusted to approximate that of the petroleum
      fuel with which it is to be mixed. For example, a mixture of 60%
      naptha, 30% butanol and 10% methanol and magnesium laurel salts in
      an amount of between 0.0001 and 0.001 pound per gallon yields a
      synthetic fuel having a flash point of approximately 115 degrees
      Fahrenheit which is compatible with the typical home heating oil.
      The range over which the mixture may be varied to produce
      synthetic fuels compatible with the range of petroleum fuels is:<br>
      <br>
      <b>Naptha: 20%-60%</b><b><br>
      </b><b> Methanol: 10%-40%</b><b><br>
      </b><b> Butanol: 20%-40%</b><b><br>
      </b><b> Magnesium Laurel Salts: 0.0001-0.001 pound/gallon</b><br>
      <br>
      It will thus be seen that the applicant has provided a new and
      novel composition of matter of great utility as a synthetic fuel
      which may be used either alone or in mixture as an extender with a
      petroleum fuel. Since certain changes in the composition described
      above will occur to those skilled in the art without departure
      from the scope of the invention it is intended that all matter
      contained herein shall be interpreted as illustrative and not in a
      limiting sense.<br>
