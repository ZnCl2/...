      </div>
      <br>
      Acoustics experts at RMIT University have created a new class of
      sound wave – the first in more than half a century – in a
      breakthrough they hope could lead to a revolution in stem cell
      therapy.<br>
      <br>
      <div align="center"><b>Dr Amgad Rezk</b><br>
      </div>
      <div align="center"><img alt="" src="16010%20.jpg" height="281"
          width="421"><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      The RMIT team combined two different types of acoustic sound waves
      called bulk waves and surface waves to create a new hybrid:
      “surface reflected bulk waves”.<br>
      <br>
      The first new class of sound wave discovered in decades, the
      powerful waves are gentle enough to use in biomedical devices to
      manipulate highly fragile stem cells without causing damage or
      affecting their integrity, opening new possibilities in stem cell
      treatment.<br>
      <br>
      Dr Amgad Rezk, from RMIT’s Micro/Nano Research Laboratory, said
      the team was already using the discovery to dramatically improve
      the efficiency of an innovative new “nebuliser” that could deliver
      vaccines and other drugs directly to the lung.<br>
      <br>
      “We have used the new sound waves to slash the time required for
      inhaling vaccines through the nebuliser device, from 30 minutes to
      as little as 30 seconds,” Rezk said.<br>
      <br>
      “But our work also opens up the possibility of using stem cells
      more efficiently for treating lung disease, enabling us to
      nebulise stem cells straight into a specific site within the lung
      to repair damaged tissue.<br>
      <br>
      “This is a real game changer for stem cell treatment in the
      lungs.”<br>
      <br>
      The researchers are using the “surface reflected bulk waves” in a
      breakthrough device, dubbed HYDRA, which converts electricity
      passing through a piezoelectric chip into mechanical vibration, or
      sound waves, which in turn break liquid into a spray.<br>
      <br>
      “It’s basically ‘yelling’ at the liquid so it vibrates, breaking
      it down into vapour,” Rezk said.<br>
      <br>
      Bulk sound waves operate similar to a carpet being held at one end
      and shaken, resulting in the whole substrate vibrating as one
      entity. Surface sound waves on the other hand operate more like
      ocean waves rolling above a swimmer’s head.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      “The combination of surface and bulk wave means they work in
      harmony and produce a much more powerful wave,” said Rezk, who
      co-authored the study with PhD researcher James Tan.<br>
      <br>
      “As a result, instead of administering or nebulising medicine at
      around 0.2 ml per minute, we did up to 5 ml per minute. That’s a
      huge difference.”<br>
      <br>
      The breakthrough HYDRA device is improving the effectiveness of a
      revolutionary new type of nebuliser developed at RMIT called
      Respite. Cheap, lightweight and portable, the advanced Respite
      nebuliser can deliver everything from precise drug doses to
      patients with asthma and cystic fibrosis, to insulin for diabetes
      patients, and needle-free vaccinations to infants.<br>
      <br>
      The HYDRA research has been published in the scientific journal
      Advanced Materials.<br>

      <br>
      Poloidal flow is curiously formed in a microliter sessile water
      drop over 157–225 MHz because of acoustic streaming from
      three-dimensional standing Lamb waves in a lithium niobate
      substrate. The flow possesses radial symmetry with downwelling at
      the center and upwelling around the periphery of the drop. Outside
      this frequency range, the attenuation occurs over a length scale
      incompatible with the drop size and the poloidal flow vanishes.
      Remarkably, shear-induced migration was found to drive toroidal
      particle ring formation with diameters inversely proportional to
      the frequency of the acoustic irradiation.<br>

      The existence of what is termed here as a surface-reflected bulk

      counterintuitively, that it is possible to obtain an
      order-of-magnitude improvement in microfluidic manipulation
      efficiency, and, in particular, nebulization, through a unique
      combination of surface and bulk waves without increasing

      Inventor(s): REZK AMGAD / YEO LESLIE / FRIEND JAMES<br>

      A piezoelectric actuation platform (1) including piezoelectric
      substrate (3) formed from a single crystal piezoelectric material,
      and at least one simple electrode (5) in contact with the
      piezoelectric substrate for applying an electrical signal to the
      substrate such that a lamb or surface acoustic wave can be
      generated within said substrate.<br>
      <br>
      <b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [00013 The present invention is generally directed to
      piezoelectric actuated apparatus, and in particular to a
      piezoelectric actuation platform for use in such apparatus,<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0002] Ceramic, polycrystalline materials such as lead zirconate
      titanate (commonly known as 'PZT'), are commonl selected as a
      substrate for a piezoelectric actuation platform because this
      material offers large electromechanical coupling coefficients, kf,
      being the ratio between the produced mechanical energy to the
      input electrical energy. The presence of lead in PZT however
      limits its potential uses in consumer and medical technology, In
      order to provide a lead free substrate, the use of single crystal
      piezoelectric materials not containing leads, such as Hthium
      niobate (LiNbOs) has therefore been considered for use in such
      applications.<br>
      <br>
      [00033 Compared with PZT and other ceramic, polycrystalline
      materials that offer large electromechanical coupling
      coefficients, kt&lt;2&gt;, the use of single crystal,
      piezoelectric material is traditionally viewed as only reasonable
      for very high frequency (VHF) devices and up, from ~1 MHz to -100
      GHz in frequency. These single crystal piezoelectric materials
      include, but are not limited to, bulk lithium niobate, thin film
      lithium niobate, bulk lithium tanfalate, thin film lithium
      tanta!ate. Gallium Nitride, Quartz and Langasite. This is
      principally due to their relatively tow kt&lt;2&gt;„ However, the
      large quality factor, Q, and associated low damping of single
      crystal materials are an important aspect. The quality factor for
      Lithium Niobate is around 20.000, while the quality factor of PZT,
      even under the most ideal of conditions, is only around 1000 for
      very low frequencies. [0004] There is a mistaken perception that
      Qm(PZT) remains at this value for frequencies up to a few MHz, and
      that the coefficients of single crystal materials like Lithium
      Niobate are simply too small to justify use of these materials in
      comparison to PZT and other similar polycrystalline piezoceramic
      materials whatever the Q values might be.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] High frequency devices working at frequencies between 1 MHz
      to 10 GHz, are ideal for micro to nano-scale actuator devices due
      to the short wavelengths and, in particular, very large
      accelerations that can be generated at such high frequencies.
      Because the maximum particle velocity that can be induced in a
      solid material, being about 1 m/s, is roughly independent of
      frequency, therefore for frequencies from less than 1 kHz to
      greater than 10 GHz, the acceleration that can be induced
      increases linearly with the frequency. This acceleration is around
      6 million times the acceleration of gravity when using a 10 MHz
      device, and greater than 600 million times the acceleration for a
      1 GHz device. Such devices therefore represent one of the most
      powerful means of driving acceleration known, apart from particle
      accelerators. These accelerations can be used to propel fluid and
      solid objects at the micro scale in a variety of creative ways
      that are now appearing in applications from robotics to<br>
      <br>
      biomedicine. What is needed is a means to efficiently generate
      such acceleration. The current state-of-the-art as described in
      patent and academic literature, and particularly in
      telecommunications do not address this need nor describe a way to
      do so.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Indeed, an appropriate figure of merit is needed for the
      piezoelectric material, a quantity that defines the potential
      performance of the material for a specific application. This
      figure of merit value has in the past been defined by the product
      of kt&lt;2&gt;and Qm. This value can be quite large for Lithium
      Niobate, for example, and larger than PZT for practical
      applications of the materials in microdevices, a fact not
      recognised in the currently available literature. The very large
      values of Q in single crystal materials compared to bulk materials
      therefore overwhelms the discrepancy in kt&lt;2&gt;values. [0007]
      The overwhelmingly common use of single-crystal piezoelectric
      material such as Lithium Niobate is in generating and using
      surface acoustic waves, taking advantage of the low losses, large
      energy density, and various other features of surface waves.
      Unfortunately, the use of Lithium Niobate typically requires the
      deposition of electrodes upon its surface using photolithography.
      Forming such electrodes requires cleanroom facilities and
      precision techniques to fabricate such structures, representing an
      initial cost for establishment or access to such a facilit and
      ongoing costs in fabricating devices.<br>
      <br>
      [0008J While it is possible to generate bulk waves in single
      crystal piezoelectric materials with large electrodes across
      exposed faces of these materials, few applications make use of
      this ability, with virtually all bulk wave applications of
      piezoelectric materials instead using PZT, ZnO and other
      pplycrystalline materials.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] Vibrations generated in piezoelectric materials with
      standard large electrodes are typically simple in form: i.e.
      thickness, radial, or shear, with no phase shift across the
      vibrating structure. Large electrodes have dimensions that cover a
      significant portion of the surface of the piezoelectric substrate
      they are in contact with.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] Small electrodes, of dimensions of the waveiength/2 or less
      along the vibration propagation direction but long across the
      propagation direction (usuall many multiples of the wavelength),
      are used for generating surface or bulk acoustic waves possessing
      wavelengths that are small in comparison to the dimensions of the
      piezoelectric material the vibrations are being generated in.
      Furthermore, typically suc electrodes have repeated patterns
      (i.e., interdigital electrodes with numerous "finger pairs" for
      Rayieigh SAW or Lam waves or Love waves); the number of
      repetitions is usually chosen based on a desire to match
      impedances or achieve a desired bandwidth for the transducer. Such
      electrodes are typically required to be deposited on the surface
      of the piezoelectric material using photolithographic fabrication
      processes.<br>
      <br>
      [001.1 J It would be advantageous to be able to have a
      piezoelectric actuation platform that avoids the need for
      electrodes to be deposited on the piezoelectric substrate surface
      using photolithography.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] It would also be advantageous to be able to use at least
      one simple electrode, either a large electrode or small point
      electrode, to generate vibrations with wavelengths that are short
      in comparison to the dimensions of the vibrating piezoelectric
      materia!.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0013] According to one aspect of the present invention, there is
      provided a piezoelectric actuation platform including a
      piezoelectric substrate formed from a single crystal piezoelectric
      materia!, and at least one simple electrode contactable with the
      piezoelectric substrate for applying an electrical signal to the
      substrate such that a lamb or surface acoustic wave can be
      generated within said substrate.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] The single crystal piezoelectric material may preferably be
      selected from one of the following group: bu!k !ithium niobate,
      thin film lithium niobate, bulk lithium tantalate, thin film
      lithium tantalate, Gallium Nitride, Quartz, and Langasite.<br>
      <br>
      [00 5] The simple electrode may be in contact with a surface of
      the piezoelectric substrate. Alternatively, the simple electrode
      may be in the form of a conducting material sputtered on a surface
      of the piezoelectric substrate. The conducting material may for
      example be a meta! such as gold.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] As the simple electrode is not deposited on the
      piezoelectric substrate surface using photolithographic processes,
      it is not necessary for that surface to be polished. Therefore,
      the piezoelectric substrate surfac may be left unpolished further
      reducing production costs.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] According to a preferred embodiment of the piezoelectric
      actuation platform according to the present invention, the simple
      electrode may be a large electrode in contact with a significant
      portion of the piezoelectric substrate surface. The electrode may
      be in the form of a conductive sheet material which may be in a
      variety of different shapes including L-shaped, strip shaped,
      curved or circular shaped.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] According to another preferred embodiment of the invention,
      the simple electrode may be a point electrode in contact with a
      point on the surface of the piezoelectric substrate surface.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] It is also preferable for the electrical signal applied to
      the piezoelectric substrate to be at a frequency substantially
      matching one or more resonant frequencies of the piezoelectric
      substrate. This allows the piezoelectric actuation platform
      according to the present invention to operate at different
      frequencies for different applications.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] The present invention utilizes one or more simple
      electrodes to apply an electrical signal to the piezoelectric
      substrate, and does not require electrode material to be deposited
      on a surface of the piezoelectric substrate utilizing
      photolithography. This drastically reduces the cost for
      fabrication of the piezoelectric actuation platform according to
      the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0021 J Furthermore, the use of simple electrodes in combination
      with single crystal materials achieves very large values for the
      figure of merit, and allows large amplitude ultrasonic waves to be
      formed in the piezoelectric substrate. The present invention is
      useful for a variety of applications, and does not require complex
      fabrication techniques, or the need to resort to lead-based or
      polycrystalline material to achieve these results. [0022] The
      combination of simple electrodes and single crystal piezoelectric
      materials provides a very attractive solution for many
      applications. For example, the present invention may be used in
      the manipulation of liquid droplets, or fluids in enclosed micro
      to nanofluidic devices, or in the jetting, mixing, and
      nebulisation of such liquids. The present invention may also be
      used in the manipulation of particles and cells within these
      liquids for a broad variety of applications in chemistry and
      medicine.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] Furthermore, specific benefits offered by the use of single
      crystal piezoelectric material add to the advantages presented by
      the favourable figure of merit. These benefits arise due to the

      applications, the semiconducting qualities of GaN and associated
      ability to generate coherent light in thai material for lasers,
      monolithic integrated circuits containing amplification, memory,

      these materials and therefore the reduction of lead- based
      materials in consumer and medical technology that employ these
      devices, making the technology environmentally safe and compliant
      with stringent international rules regarding the elimination of

      [0024] There is also the advantage in some embodiments of the
      absence of a coherent propagating wave, helpful for providing
      acoustic energy to more than one location that may be "shadowed"
      by another location.<br>

      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [00393 The fabrication process for the piezoelectric actuation
      platform according to the present invention preferably involves
      three different strategies. The first strategy uses a simple
      electrode configuration where a metal such as an aluminum strip is
      brought into physical contact with lithium niobate for actuation,
      when an AC current is applied. In a second strategy, for
      relatively more precious electrode materials, the fabrication
      process is conducted by masking portions of the lithium niobate
      surface using a predefined 'shadow' mask, using high quality tape
      for example, and then by sputtering the surface with a conducting
      material - such as gold - followed by peeling of the tape, A third
      strategy involves sputtering gold on the lithium niobate surface,
      printing a design on paper and transferring the ink/pattern onto
      the lithium niobate surface by heat, especially using a standard
      laminator, followed by etching the remaining bare gold. It is
      noted that in the case of Lamb waves, the electrodes can be on one
      side of the lithium niobate block while the working surface where,
      for example microfluidic actuation can occur is on the opposing
      side. This can be achieved because Lamb waves are a type of bulk
      waves. This is advantageous in the case where conductive fluids
      are used as this avoids short-circuiting should the fluid come in
      contact with the electrode metal. The surface of the piezoelectric
      substrate is normaily required to be polished when the electrodes
      need to be deposited using photolithography. According to the
      present invention, the surface does not need to be polished and
      may therefore be left unpolished. [0040] Figure 1 is a plan view
      of a piezoelectric actuation platform 1 according to the present
      invention. The piezoelectric substrate used in the experimentation
      was lithium niobate. The present invention is not however
      restricted to this material, and other single crystal
      piezoelectric materials could also be used. That platform 1
      includes a piezoelectric substrate 3 formed from a single crystal
      piezoelectric material such as lithium niobate. A pair of
      aluminium strips 5 connected to a power supply is brought into
      physicai contact with the piezoelectric substrate 3. Only one
      example of the configuration of the electrode 7 is shown in Figure
      1 , and other configurations are also possible. Therefore, the
      electrodes configuration may include L-shaped electrodes, one or
      more spot electrodes, line shaped electrodes, curved electrodes or
      circular electrodes. For example, a single point contact electrode
      reliant on a floating ground could be used. The power supply 7 can
      provide an ultrasonic signal that corresponds to one or more of
      the resonant frequency of the LiNbC1⁄2 substrate. Th significant
      of this is that mu!ti resonances are present for one single
      piezoelectric actuation platform, allowing different applications
      at different frequencies. We also note that the resonances are
      proportional to the lithium niobate thickness and could be altered
      by changing its thickness.<br>
      <br>
      [00413 Figures 2 to12 illustrate various experimental results and
      data obtained on experiments conducted on piezoelectric actuation
      platform 1 according to the present invention. Figure 13 shows an
      atomizer apparatus using the described piezoelectric platform 1.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] Figures 2a and b respectively show particles suspended
      within a liquid droplet located on the surface of the
      piezoelectric substrate platform. Figure 2a shows the particles
      distributed through the liquid droplet after power is applied to
      the platform. Application of a very low input power in the order
      of between 0.1 to 0.2 watts results in the particles aggregating
      together to form distinctive patterns due to the acoustic
      radiation. Such particle aggregation can be used for various
      particle trapping and isolation applications. [0043] When a
      slightly higher input power of between 0.2 to 0,4 watts is applied
      to the piezoelectric actuation platform, different behaviour is
      observed in the aggregation of particles suspended within a fluid
      droplet located on the platform surface. Depending on the location
      of the liquid droplet with respect to the electrode, particles can
      rotate within the liquid due to the poloidal flo within that
      droplet to form two island concentration spots as shown in Figure
      3b. The increase in f luorescent intensity by concentration of the
      particles has potential applications in sensing, and especially
      with respect to bio-molecu!es.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] Figures 4a to 4d shows the effect that varying the location
      of the liquid droplet relative to the electrode on the
      piezoelectric actuation platform surface can have on the behaviour
      of particles suspended within that liquid droplet. In the
      experiments, an input power of between 0.2 to 0.4 watts was
      applied to the platform 1. Varying the location of the liquid
      droplet resulted in the particles suspended within the liquid
      droplet aggregating in different patterns, or the particles
      rotating within the droplet due to the induced poloidal flow
      within the droplet to form a ring concentration pattern as best
      shown in Figures 4b and 4d.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] A unique particle concentration mechanism and application
      is shown in Figures 5a to 5c where, strong poloidal flow leads to
      particle ring formation followed by ring instability and
      eventually particle aggregation along a radial line within the
      drop. Particle concentration has a wide of applications,
      especially with biosensing where the optical signal increases a
      million fold after concen trati ng particl es/b i o -molec u les .<br>
      <br>
      [0046] Application of powe to the piezoelectric actuation platform
      can also result in displacement of the fluid droplet on the
      platform surface. Figures 6a and 6b respectively show a liquid
      droplet located on the piezoelectric actuation platform surface,
      which has been inclined at any angle relative to a horizontal
      plane. Application of a slightly higher input power greater than
      0.5 watts in the experiments resulted in the vibration and
      spinning of the liquid droplet as shown in Figure 6a. Furthermore,
      the liquid droplet would also move under the influence of gravity
      due to the contact Sine of the drop being unpinned due to the
      inclination of the platform surface as shown in Figure 6b. The
      displacement of the liquid droplet can alternatively be achieved
      by breaking the spatial symmetry of the electrodes, using
      asymmetric electrodes shape or by creating asymmetry in the chip s
      edge or strategically placing the drop so that only portions of
      the drop is exposed to the acoustic waves. The ability to displace
      a liquid droplet located on the platform surface has applications
      in the lab-on-a-chip (LOG) field.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] Applying a higher input power to the piezoelectric
      actuation platform can also result in distortion of the liquid
      droplet interface. Figures 7a and 7b respectively shows a liquid
      droplet prior to application of power as shown in Figure 7a, and
      following the application of an input power of above 0.5 watts.
      This results in the liquid droplet forming a conical shape which
      can then eventually breaks up and form a liquid jet. Such liquid
      behaviour could be useful for printing applications as well as in
      viscosity measurement applications.<br>
      <br>
      [00483 The piezoelectric substrate platform according to the
      present invention can also be used in micro engineering
      applications. Figures 8a and 8b respectively show a rotor-shaped
      object place within the liquid droplet when stationary as shown in
      Figure 8a prior to actuation of the piezoelectric platform, or
      rotating as shown in Figure 8b following actuation. The experiment
      involved the application of an input power of around 0.5 watts
      which resulted in rotation of the liquid within the liquid droplet
      forcing the rotation of the rotor shaped object<br>
      <br>
      [0049] The piezoelectric actuation platform according to the
      present invention could also be used to move other reSatively
      large objects weighing a few grams. Figures 9a and 9b show the
      movement of a cluster of salt grains following the application of
      an input power to the piezoelectric actuation platform. Figures 9c
      and 9d similarly show the movement of a large cluster of salt
      following the application of an input power to the piezoelectric
      actuation platform. This demonstrates the potential application of
      the piezoelectric actuation platform as a surface cleaner. [0050]
      The piezoelectric actuation piatform according to the present
      invention can also be used in the atomisation of liquid. Figures
      10a and 10b respectively shows a liquid droplet on the
      piezoelectric platform surface prior to any input power being
      applied to the platform, and the liquid being converted to a mist
      in Figure 10b following application of an input power of between
      0.7 to 2 watts to the piezoelectric actuation platform.<br>
      <br>
      [0051 ] Figure 1 1 various infrared images of the heat
      distribution of the piezoelectric actuation platform according to
      the present invention prior to the input power being applied
      (Figure 11a) during the application of an input power (Figure 1 1
      b), and immediately after the input power has been discontinued
      (Figure 1 1 c). These images show that the overall heat generation
      is significantly lower in the present invention where simple
      electrodes are used when compared to piezoelectric actuation
      platforms using inter-digital transducers where temperatures can
      be in the order of between 60 - 95°C. In fact, conventional IDTs
      have been used as a drop heater and other PGR applications which
      requires high temperatures. By comparison, the maximum temperature
      observed in the piezoelectric substrate platform according to the
      present invention is in the order of around 40 degrees Celsius.
      The lower operating temperatures can allow the platform to be used
      in a greater variety of applications where high temperature needs
      to be avoided. The piezoelectric actuation platform according to
      the present invention may for example be used in the manipulation
      of heat sensitive bio-material. Furthermore, lower operational
      temperatures can increase the reliability of that apparatus using
      a piezoelectric actuation platform according to the present
      invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] Figure 12 shows a graph of the drop size distribution of
      atomised drops produced in the arrangement shown in Figure 10. As
      shown in the results, the atomized drops have a monodispersed
      distribution as well as a small size (below 5 microns) rendering
      them ideal for many practical applications, especially for drug
      delivery to the lungs [0053] Figure 13 is a schematic diagram
      showing an atomizer apparatus using the piezoelectric actuator
      platform 1 according to the present invention. One or more liquid
      reservoirs 9 can supply liquid to the platform surface 12. A wick
      formed from paper, fabric or other hydrophilic material may extend
      from the reservoir 9 to the platform surface 12. The wick 1 1 has
      an edge 13 in contact with the platform surface 12 from which
      liquid transferred along each wick 1 1 can be atomized. The fluid
      is drawn through the wick 11 as a result of the atomization of the
      fluid at the wick edge 13. The wick 1 1 can include channels
      formed by applying a pattern on areas of the wick surface 15 using
      a hydrophobic material such as wax or photoresist. This allows for
      more than one fluid to be transferred and/or mixed on the wick
      surface 15. Three such wicks are shown in Figure 15 to allow for
      more than one different liquid to be atomised at the same time
      from a single piezoelectric actuation platform 1.<br>
