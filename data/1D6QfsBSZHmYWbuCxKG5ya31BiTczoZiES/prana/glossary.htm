        Knowledge that comes to us from the experience or researches of

        The <i>Vedas</i> are called <i>Agama</i> for the same reason.

      <p><i>Kram</i> ~ The tantric symbol for the idea of the human
        mind, stepping beyond the ordinary bounds of the visible and
        thus peeping into the invisible. The ancient tantric
        philosophers had algebraic symbols to denote almost every idea.
        This was absolutely necessary to them, because they held that if
        the human mind were fixed upon any object with sufficient
        strength for a certain time, it was sure by the force of will to
        attain the object. The attention was secured generally by
        constantly muttering certain words, and thus keeping the idea
        always before the mind. Shortly, algebraic symbols were
        therefore used to denote every idea. Thus <i>Hrien</i> denotes
        modesty, <i>Kliw</i> denotes love, <i>Aiw</i> denotes
        protection, <i>Shaum</i> denotes warfare, and so on. Similar
        symbols were used to name blood vessels, etc. The tantric
        science is now almost completely lost; at present there is no
        available comprehensive key to the symbolical terminology, and
        now much of the symbolic language is simply unintelligible. </p>

      <p><i>Maheshwara</i> ~ The great Lord, the great Power. </p>

      <p><i>Manas</i> ~ Mind; the third principle of the Universe from
        below. </p>
      <p><i>Manomayakosha</i> ~ The mental coil. The individualized mind
        that is, as it were, a sheath for the spiritual energy to
        manifest itself in, in the particular way we find the mind

      <p><i>Manu</i> ~ The Being conceived as being the substratum of
        the third principle of the Universe from below. The idea of the
        humanity of one of those cycles known as <i>manwantaras</i>. </p>
      <p><i>Manusha</i> ~ Pertaining to men; human. <i>Manusha</i> day:
        the ordinary day of 24 hours; <i>manusha</i> year: the ordinary
        solar year. The lunar month is known as the day of the fathers (<i>Pitrya</i>),



        the solar year itself is known as the day of the gods. </p>
      <p><i>Manwantara</i> ~ A cycle of 71 <i>Chaturyugis</i>, during
        which reigns one <i>Manu</i>, i.e., during which exists
        humanity of a certain type. </p>

      <p><i>Meru</i> ~ Also called <i>Sumeru</i>. The <i>Puranas</i>
        speak of its being a mountain (parvata, achala) on which is
        situated <i>Swarga</i>, the heaven of India, which contains the
        cities of gods, having celestial spirits for inhabitants. It is,
        in fact, spoken of as the Olympus of the Hindus. The fact is
        that <i>Meru</i> is no mountain of earthly mould, such as we
        are familiar with on earth. It is the boundary line that divides
        the atmosphere of earth from the upper air, the pure aether; the
        Meru is the bounding circle of the Terrestrial <i>Prana</i>.
        This side of the circle is our planet with its atmosphere; that
        side is the celestial <i>Prana</i>, the abode of the
        celestials. The sage Vyasa describes the <i>Bhurloka</i>
        (Earth) as extending from sea level (<i>a vicheb prabhriti</i>)
        to the back of the <i>Meru</i> (<i>Meru prishtham yavat</i>).
        On the face of the so-called mountain live the celestials, hence
        the earth’s boundary is its back. This is called a mountain from
        its fixed, unchangeable position. </p>

      <p><i>N</i> ~ The symbol for one of the <i>Nadi</i> that ramify
        from the heart. </p>
      <p><i>Nadi</i> ~ This word means a tube, a vessel. It is applied
        indiscriminately to blood vessels and nerves. The idea of the
        word is that of a tube, a vessel, or even a line, along which
        something flows, be it a liquid or the current of a force. </p>
      <p><i>Naga</i> ~ The manifestation of life that causes belching. </p>

      <p><i>Nidra</i> ~ Dreamless sleep. </p>
      <p><i>Nimesha</i> ~ A division of time = 8/45th of a second.
        Literally, it means the twinkling of the eye. </p>

        without the least effort of thought, the past and future, the
        antecedents and consequents of a present phenomenon at once make

      <p><i>Nirvitarka</i> ~ A kind of intuition (<i>sampatti</i>), the
        wordless intuition. It is that state of mental lucidity in which
        the truths of nature shine of themselves without the

      </p>
      <p><i>Panchi Karana</i> ~ Literally, the word means making
        fivefold. It has been roughly translated as the division into
        five. It means the process of a minimum of a <i>tatwa</i> being
        composed with those of others. Thus, after the process, every
        molecule, say of the <i>prithivi tatwa</i>, will consist of
        eight minima. <i>Prithivi</i> =&nbsp; <i>Prithivi </i>/4 + <i>Akasa


        </i>/1 + <i>Vayu </i>/1 + <i>Agni </i>/1 + <i>Apas</i> /1
        and so on. In <i>ananda</i> the <i>tatwas</i> are single. In <i>vijnana</i>
        and afterwards each is fivefold, and hence each has a color,
        etc. </p>

      <p><i>Prana</i> ~ The life principle of the Universe and its
        localized manifestation; the life principle of man and other
        living beings. It consists of an ocean of the five <i>tatwas</i>.
        The suns are the different centers of the ocean of <i>Prana</i>.
        Our solar system is filled to its extreme limit with the <i>Prana</i>,
        and it is in this ocean that the various heavenly bodies move.
        It is held that the whole ocean of <i>Prana</i> with the sun
        and moon and other planets is a complete picture of every living
        organism on earth or any other planet. Hence sometimes <i>Prana</i>
        is spoken of as a person, a living being. All the manifestations
        of life in the body are known as minor <i>pranas</i>. The
        pulmonary manifestation is known as <i>prana</i> by

        tatwa are found in painful excess. </p>

      <p><i>Sa</i> ~ The algebraic symbol for the process of

        life matter, also is called <i>Sa</i>. </p>
      <p><i>Sadhakapitta</i> ~ The temperature of the heart, said to be
        the cause of intelligence and understanding. </p>
      <p><i>Samadhi</i> ~ Trance; the state in which the mind is so much

        forget itself in the object of its attention. </p>
      <p><i>Samana</i> ~ That manifestation of life which in the abdomen

        over the body. </p>
      <p><i>Samprajnata</i> ~ A kind of samadhi; that in which the
        mental application is rewarded by the discovery of truth. </p>
      <p><i>Sandhi</i> ~ The conjunction of the positive and negative
        phases of any force. This is a synonym of <i>susumna</i>. The
        conjunction of two <i>tatwas</i>. When one <i>tatwa</i> passes
        into another the <i>akasa</i> intervenes. In fact, there can be
        no change from one state of matter to another without this
        all-pervading <i>tatwa</i> intervening. This intervening state,
        however, is not the <i>Sandhi</i>. By tatwic conjunction a new
        conjunct <i>tatwa</i> is always produced. This is indicated by
        the length of the breath. Thus, when the <i>agni</i> and the <i>vayu</i>
        conjoin, the length is somewhere between these two. Similarly
        for other <i>tatwas</i>. If the positive and negative phases in
        any object make their appearance in regular immediate succession
        for some time, they will be said to be in conjunction (<i>Sandhi</i>).




        If coming from opposite directions, however, they cancel each
        other out, and the result is either <i>akasa</i> or <i>susumna</i>.
        The reader will perceive that there is very little difference,
        and sometimes none at all, in the states of <i>akasa</i>, <i>sandhi</i>,
        and <i>susumna</i>. If <i>akasa</i> remains stationary, it is
        <i>susumna</i>; if <i>susumna</i> tends towards production, it
        becomes <i>akasa</i>. In fact, <i>akasa</i> is that state
        which immediately foreshadows any other tatwic state of being. </p>
      <p><i>Sansakara</i> ~ Acquired velocity; acquired habits. A
        synonym of <i>Vasana</i>. </p>
      <p><i>Saraswati</i> ~ The goddess of speech. </p>
      <p><i>Sat</i> ~ The first state of the Universe, in which every

      <p><i>Tatwa</i> ~ (1) A mode of motion; (2) the central impulse
        that keeps matter in a certain vibratory state; (3) a distinct
