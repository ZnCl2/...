        1. The goddess said: My Lord Mahadeva, the god of gods, be kind
        to me, and tell me the wisdom that comprehends everything. </p>
      <p>2. How did the universe come out? How does it go on? How does
        it disappear? Tell me, O Lord, the philosophy of the universe. </p>
      <p><i>Notes ~</i> "The god said"; "the goddess said"; "said the
        god"; "said the goddess". The whole book is couched in the form
        of a dialogue between the god Siva and his wife Parvati. All the
        <i>tantras</i> have the same form. It is hardly consistent with
        facts to hold that Siva and Parvati were a human pair in some
        ancient period. The former is generally spoken of in this book
        as <i>Iswara</i>, the latter as <i>Devi</i> or <i>Shakti</i>.
        Judging from its method of composition, the book under notice
        does not seem to have been written by <i>Siva</i>. In the first
        place, there are several stanzas in the book that appear to be
        the composition of different authors, but in the present form by
        some compiler. Secondly, the author says in one place that he
        was going to describe certain experiments as he had seen them in
        the <i>Sivagama</i> (<i>The Teaching of Siva</i>). In the end
        of one ms., however, it si said that the book comprises the
        eighth chapter of <i>Sivagama</i>. </p>
      <p>In the <i>Kenopnishat</i> the great commentator Shankaracharya
        interprets <i>Uma Haimvait</i> (another name of <i>Parvati</i>)
        as <i>Brahma Vidya</i>, the Divine Science or Theosophia.
        There, however, the goddess appears as a teacheress, and she
        might well be interpreted as Theosophia. That explanation will
        hardly hold good here. Here <i>Siva</i> and <i>Parvati</i>
        seem to be the male and female principles. They are the best
        acquainted with their own workings. The god, the male principle,
        explaining to Sakti, the female principle, the various modes in
        which the finer forces of nature imprint themselves upon the
        grosser planes, might be the symbol of the eternal impression of
        all thoughts and living organisms into the <i>Sakti</i> (the
        cooler matter <i>rayi</i>) by <i>Siva</i>, the hotter male
        principle. </p>
      <p>3. Said the god: The universe came out of <i>tatwa</i> or the
        <i>tatwas</i>; it goes on by the instrumentality of the <i>tatwas</i>;
        it disappears in the <i>tatwas</i>; by the <i>tatwas</i> is
        known the nature of the universe. </p>
      <p><i>Notes ~</i> In the original the singular number is often
        used to denote the common quality of the five <i>tatwas</i>,
        that by which each is known as such. </p>
      <p>The universe comprehends all the manifestations with which we
        are familiar, either on the physical, the mental, or the psychic
        plane. All of them have come out of the <i>tatwas</i>. The <i>tatwas</i>
        are the forces that lie at the root of all these manifestations
        Creation, preservation, and destruction, or more strictly
        speaking, appearance, sustenance, and disappearance of the
        phenomena with which we are acquainted are tatwic changes of
        state. </p>
      <p>4. Said the goddess: The Knowers of the tatwas have ascertained
        the <i>tatwa</i> to be the highest root; what, O God, is the
        nature of the <i>tatwas</i>? Throw light upon the tatwas. </p>
      <p>5. Said the god: Unmanifested, formless, one giver of light is
        the great Power; from that appeared the soniferous ether (<i>akasa</i>);




        from that had birth the tangiferous ether. </p>
      <p><i>Notes ~</i> This is the <i>parabrahma</i> of the Vedantins,
        the first change of state that stands at the top of evolution.
        This is the first positive phase of life. All the <i>Upanishads</i>
        concur in this. In the beginning all this was <i>Sat</i> (the
        positive phase of <i>Brahma</i>). From this state the five
        ethers (<i>tatwas</i> or <i>mahabhutas</i> as they are also
        called) come out by degrees. "From him came the <i>Akasa</i>
        and so on", said the <i>Upanishad</i>. This state of <i>parabrahma</i>
        is called in the text "Unmanifested". Manifestation for us only
        begins with the "Ego", the sixth principle of our constitution;
        all beyond that is naturally unmanifested, "Formless". This
        epithet is given because forms only show themselves when the <i>tatwas</i>
        and the two states of matter, the male and female, the hotter
        and the cooler, come into existence. As yet there is only one
        universal state of matter. Hence that state is also given the
        epithet One. </p>
      <p>He is also called the Giver of Light. This light is the real
        life. It is this state that transmutes into the five ethers that
        form the atmosphere of the sixth principle of the universe.</p>
      <p>6. From the tangiferous ether, the luminiferous ether, and from
        this the gustiferous ether; from thence was the birth of the
        odiferous ether. These are the five ethers and they have
        five-fold extension. </p>
      <p>7. Of these the universe came out; by these it goes on; into
        these it disappears; even among these it shows itself again. </p>
      <p>8. The body is made of the five <i>tatwas</i>; the five <i>tatwas</i>,
        O Fair One, exist therein in the subtle form; they are known by
        the learned who devote themselves to the <i>tatwas</i>. </p>
      <p><i>Notes ~</i> The body, human as well as every other, is made
        of the five <i>tatwas</i> in their gross form. In this gross
        body play the five <i>tatwas</i> in their subtle form. They
        govern it physiologically, mentally, psychically and
        spiritually. These are therefore the four subtle forms of the <i>tatwas</i>.
      </p>
      <p>9. On this account shall I speak of the rise of breath in the
        body; by knowing the nature of inspiration and expiration comes
        into being the knowledge of the three times. </p>
      <p><i>Notes ~</i> Man can devote himself most easily to his own
        body. On this account the laws of the rise of the breath in the
        body have been described here. </p>
      <p>Knowledge of the three times (the past, the present and the
        future) is nothing more than a scientific knowledge of the
        causes and effects of phenomena. Know the present <i>tatwic</i>
        state of things, know its antecedent and consequent states, and
        you have a knowledge of the three times. </p>
      <p>10. This science of the rise of breath, the hidden of the
        hidden, the shower of the true Good, is a pearl on the head of
        the wise. </p>
      <p>11. This knowledge is the subtle of the subtle; it is easily
        understood; it causes the belief of truth; it excites wonder in
        the world of unbelievers; it is the support among unskeptical
        people. </p>
      <p>12. The science of the rise of breath is to be given to the
        calm, the pure, the virtuous, the firm and the grateful,
        single-minded devote of the <i>guru</i>. </p>
      <p>13. It is not to be given to the vicious, the impure, the
        angry, the untruthful, the adulterer, and him who has wasted his
        substance. </p>
      <p>14. Hear, thou goddess, the wisdom which is found in the body;
        omniscience is caused by it, if well understood. </p>
      <p>15. In the <i>swara</i> are the <i>Vedas</i> and the <i>shastras</i>;
        in the <i>swara</i> the highest <i>gandharva</i>; in the <i>swara</i>
        are all the three worlds; the <i>swara</i> is the reflection of
        the <i>parabrahma</i>. </p>
      <p><i>Notes ~</i> "In the <i>swara</i> are the <i>Vedas</i>",
        etc. <i>Swara</i> is the current of the life-wave. It is the
        same as the intelligence of the Vedantins. The assertion in this
        stanza might have two meanings. It might mean that the things
        described in the Vedas are in the <i>swara</i>, or it might
        mean that the description itself is there. It might mean that
        both are there. This is of course an absolute fact. There is
        nothing in the manifested universe that has not received
        existence from the Great Breath, which is the <i>Prana</i> of
        the universe on the highest plane of life. </p>
      <p>16. Without a knowledge of the breath (<i>swara</i>), the
        astrologer is a hose without its lord, a speaker without
        learning, a trunk without a head. </p>
      <p>17. Whoever knows the analysis of the <i>Nadis</i>, and the <i>Prana</i>,
        the analysis of the <i>tatwa</i>, and the analysis of the
        conjunctive <i>susumna</i> gets salvation. </p>
      <p>18. It is always auspicious in the seen or the unseen universe,
        when the power of breath is mastered; they, O Fair One, that the
        knowledge of the science of breath is somewhat auspicious. </p>
      <p><i>Notes ~</i> This stanza points to the difference between
        practical and theoretical occultism. The practice is highly
        auspicious, of course, but the theory too puts us on the right
        track, and therefore is somewhat auspicious. </p>
      <p>19. The parts and the first accumulations of the universe were
        made by the <i>swara</i>, and the <i>swara</i> is visible as
        the great Power, the Creator, and the Destroyer. </p>
      <p><i>Notes ~</i> For some reflections on this subject, the reader
        is referred to the Essay on Evolution. </p>
      <p>20. A knowledge more secret than the science of Breath, wealth
        more useful than the science of Breath, a friend more true than
        the science of breath, was never seen or heard of. </p>
      <p>21. An enemy is killed during the power of the breath, and also
        friends are brought together; wealth is got during the power of
        breath, and comfort and reputation during the same. </p>
      <p><i>Notes ~</i> Every phenomenon is nothing more than a phase of
        tatwic motion. </p>
      <p>22. On account of the force of breath one gets a female child
        or meets a king; by the force of breath are gods propitiated,
        and by the breath is a king in anyone’s power. </p>
      <p>23. Locomotion is caused by the power of breath, and food too
        is taken by the power of breath; urine and faeces also are
        discharged during the power of breath. </p>
      <p>24. All the <i>Sastras</i> and <i>Purana</i>, etc., beginning
        with the <i>Vedas</i> and the <i>Upanishads</i>, contain no
        principle beyond the knowledge of <i>swara</i> (the breath). </p>
      <p>25. All are names and forms. Among all these people wander
        mistaken. They are fools steeped in ignorance unless the <i>tatwas</i>
        are known. </p>
      <p><i>Notes ~</i> All the phenomena f the universe are names and
        forms. All these names and forms live in the <i>swara</i> of <i>parabrahma</i>,
        or comparatively in the subtler <i>tatwas</i>. But there
        nothing is distinguishable. They are only distinguished as such
        when they are imprinted upon the grosser planes. The impression
        takes place by the instrumentality of <i>Rayi</i>, the cooler
        state of life-matter, which is only the shade of <i>Prana</i>,
        the original state. Hence the names and forms are all unreal. </p>
      <p>26. This science of the rise of breath is the highest of all
        the high sciences; it is a flame for illuminating the mansion of
        the soul. </p>
      <p>27. The knowledge cannot be imparted to this man or that man
        except in answer to a question; it is therefore to be known by
        one’s own exertions in the soul, by the soul, and soul alone. </p>
      <p><i>Notes ~</i> This is the celebrated dictum, "Know thyself by
        thyself", which differs from the Greek one in the addition of
        the last two words.<br>
        <br>
        28. Neither the lunar day, nor the constellations, nor the solar
        day, nor planet, nor god; neither rain nor the <i>Vyatipata</i>,
        nor the conjunctions <i>Vaidhrita</i>, etc. </p>
      <p><i>Notes ~</i> These are all of them the various phases of the
        five different tatwic states. They have a natural effect upon
        the terrestrial life. The effect differs with the thing
        influenced. The rays of the tatwic state of time will only be
        reflected into any organism if the reflecting surface is akin.
        The <i>yogi</i> who has power over his breath can put it into
        any tatwic state he chooses, and the antagonistic effect of time
        are simply thrown off. </p>
      <p>29. Nor the bad conjunctions, goddess, ever have power; when
        one gets the pure power of <i>swara</i>, everything has good
        effect. </p>
      <p>30. In the body are the <i>Nadi</i> having many forms and well
        extended; they ought to be known in the body by the wise, for
        the sake of knowledge. </p>
      <p>31. Branching off from the root in the navel, 72,000 of them
        extend in the body. </p>
      <p><i>Notes ~</i> The <i>Yogi</i> takes the navel to be the
        starting point of the system of <i>Nadi</i>. So says Patanjali,
        the great Yogi philosopher: </p>
      <p>"The systems of the body are known by concentration on the
        navel." </p>
      <p>The Vedantins take the heart to be the starting point of the
        system. The former assign as the reason, the existence in the
        navel of the Power <i>Kundalini</i>, the latter the existence
        in the heart of the cardiac soul (the <i>Lingam atma</i>),
        which is the real life of the gross body. This, however, is
        immaterial. We may begin wherever we like, if we only understand
        truly the location of the life-principle and its various
        manifestations. </p>
      <p>32. In the navel is the Power <i>Kundalini</i> sleeping like a
        serpent; thence ten <i>Nadi</i> go upwards and ten downwards. </p>
      <p><i>Notes ~</i> "The Power <i>Kundalini</i>": This power sleeps
        in the developed organism. It is that power which draws in gross
        matter from the mother organism through the umbilical cord, and
        distributes it to the different places where the seminal <i>Prana</i>
        gives it form. When the child separates from the mother the
        Power goes to sleep. She is no more wanted now. The dimensions
        of the child depend upon the supplies of the <i>Kundalini</i>.
        It is said that it is possible to awake the goddess even in the
        undeveloped organism by certain practices of <i>Yoga</i>. When
        this is done the <i>Yogi</i> gets the power of lengthening or
        shortening the limbs. </p>
      <p>33. Two and two of the <i>Nadi</i> go crosswise; they are thus
        twenty-four in number. The principal are the ten <i>Nadi</i> in
        which act the ten forces. </p>
      <p>34. Crosswise, or upwards, or downwards, in them is manifested
        the <i>prana</i> all over the body. They are in the body in the
        shape of <i>Chakras</i> supporting all the manifestations of <i>Prana</i>.
      </p>
      <p>35. Of all these, ten are principal; out of the ten, three are
        the highest: <i>Ida</i>, <i>Pingala</i>, and the <i>Susumna</i>.
      </p>
      <p>36. <i>Gandhari</i>,<i> Hastijihva</i>, <i>Pusha</i> and <i>Yashaswani</i>;
        <i>Alambusha</i>, <i>Kuhui</i>, <i>Sankhini</i>, and also <i>Damini</i>.
      </p>
      <p>37. <i>Ida</i> is in the left part, <i>Pingala</i> in the
        right, <i>Susumna</i> in the middle; <i>Gandhari</i> in the
        left eye. </p>
      <p>38. In the right eye <i>Hastijihva</i>; in the right ear <i>Pusha</i>;
        <i>Yashaswani</i> in the left ear; in the mouth <i>Alambusha</i>.
      </p>
      <p>39. <i>Kuhu</i> in the place of the generative organ; in the
        anus <i>Shankhini</i>. In this way one at each outlet stand the
        <i>Nadi</i>. </p>
      <p>40. <i>Ida</i>, <i>Pingala</i>, and <i>Susumna</i> stand in
        the way of the <i>Prana</i>, these ten <i>Nadi</i> extend
        variously in the body.<br>
        <i><br>
          Notes ~</i> For a dissertation on these three <i>Nadi</i>,
        the reader is referred to the articles on <i>Prana</i>. On a
        small scale, the right and left chambers of the heart and the
        right and left portions of the spinal column are the <i>Pingala</i>
        and <i>Ida</i>. The canal between these two is the <i>Susumna</i>.
        Taking the blood vessel system to be a mere reflection of the
        nervous system, the terminology might be applied to the nervous
        alone. It appears, however, that the <i>Nadi</i> of the <i>Tantra</i>
        comprehend both these systems. In the nervous system there is
        the real power, and this must be present everywhere where there
        is any manifestation of life. </p>
      <p>41. These are the names of the <i>Nadis</i>. Now I give the
        names of the forces: (1) <i>Prana</i>, (2) <i>Apana</i>, (3) <i>Samana</i>,
        (4) <i>Udana</i>, and (5) <i>Vyana</i> . </p>
      <p>42. (6) <i>Naga</i>, (7) <i>Kurma</i>, (8) <i>Krikila</i>,
        (9) <i>Devadatta</i>, and (10) <i>Dhananjaya</i>. In the chest
        lives always the <i>prana</i>; the <i>apana</i> in the circle
        of the anus. </p>
      <p>43. The <i>Samana</i> in the circle of the navel, the <i>Udana</i>
        in the midst of the throat; the <i>Vyana</i> pervades all over
        the body. These are the ten principal forces. </p>
      <p>44. The five beginning with the <i>Prana</i> have been
        described. The remaining five begin with <i>Naga</i>. Their
        names and places too I give: </p>
      <p>45. The <i>Naga</i> is known in belching; the <i>Kurma</i> in
        the twinkling of the eye; the <i>Krikila</i> is known as the
        cause of hunger; the <i>Devadatta</i> is known in yawning. </p>
      <p>46. The all-pervading <i>Dhananjaya</i> does not leave even
        the dead body. All these move in all the <i>Nadis</i> where
        they put on the appearance of life. </p>
      <p>47. Let the wise man know the manifest movements of the
        individualized prana by the three <i>Nadi</i>: <i>Ida</i>, <i>Pingala</i>,
        and <i>Susumna</i>. </p>
      <p>48. The <i>Ida</i> is to be known in the left half and the <i>Pingala</i>
        in the right. </p>
      <p>49. The moon is placed in the <i>Ida</i>; the sun in the <i>Pingala</i>;
        the <i>Susumna</i> has the nature of <i>Sambhu</i>, and <i>Sambhu</i>
        is the self of <i>Hansa</i> [inspiration and expiration both].
      </p>
      <p>50. Expiration is called <i>Ha</i>; inspiration is <i>Sa</i>;
        <i>Ha</i> is the <i>Siva</i> [the male], and <i>Sa</i> the <i>Sakti</i>
        [the female]. </p>
      <p>51. Appearing as <i>Sakti</i>, stands the moon, causing the
        left <i>Nadi</i> to flow; causing the right <i>Nadi</i> to
        flow, the sun appears as <i>Sambhu</i> [male]. </p>
      <p>52. Any charity given by the wise while the breath is in the
        left nostril, multiplies <i>krore</i> upon <i>krore</i> of
        times in this world. </p>
      <p>53. Let the <i>Yogi</i> look into his face, with one mind and
        with attention, and thus let him know entirely the motion of the
        sun and the moon. </p>
      <p>54. Let him meditate upon the <i>tatwa</i> when the prana is
        calm, never when it is disturbed; his desire will be fulfilled,
        he will have great benefit and victory. </p>
      <p>55. To those men who practice, and thus always keep the sun and
        moon in proper order, knowledge of the past and the future
        becomes as easy as if they were in their hand. </p>
      <p>56. In the left <i>Nadi</i> the appearance of the breath is
        that of the <i>Amrita</i> (Nectar); it is the great nourisher
        of the world. In the right, the motion-imparting portion, the
        world is always born. </p>
      <p><i>Notes ~</i> A <i>krore</i> = 10 million. The Negative phase
        of <i>Prana</i> has the qualities of <i>Amrita</i>, the giver
        of eternal life. The negative matter, the moon, is cooler than
        the positive matter, the sun. The former is <i>Rayi</i>, the
        latter <i>Prana</i>. The former receives the impressions from
        the latter, and this plays the part of imparting impressions to
        that. The moon, therefore, is the real life of all names and
        forms. In her they live; she keeps them up. She is, therefore,
        the <i>Amrita</i>, the nectar of life. The right <i>Nadi</i>
        is, from the greater temperature it possesses, the imparter of
        names and forms, or briefly, the motion-imparting phase of life
        matter. It is the tendency of the sun to always cause changes in
        names and forms, and giving new impressions in the place of the
        old. Hence the sun is the great destroyer of forms. He is the
        father of the forms, but the real preserver is the moon. </p>
      <p>57. The middle one, the <i>susumna</i>, moves very cruelly,
        and is very bad in all acts; everywhere in auspicious acts the
        left [<i>Nadi</i>] causes strength. </p>
      <p>58. In going out the left is auspicious; in going in the right
        is auspicious; the moon must be known to be even, the sun odd. </p>
      <p>59. The moon is female, the sun is male; the moon is fair, the
        sun is dark [as compared to the moon]. During the flow of the <i>Nadi</i>
        of the moon let calm acts be done. </p>
      <p>60. During the flow of the <i>Nadi</i> of the sun harsh works
        are to be done; during the flow of the <i>susumna</i> are to be
        done acts resulting in the attainments of psychic powers and
        salvation. </p>
      <p>61. In the bright fortnight the moon comes in first, in the
        dark one the sun; beginning from the first lunar day they rise
        one after the other in order, after three days each. </p>
      <p>62. The moon and the sun have each the white [northward,
        upward] and the black [southward, downward] duration of 2-1/2 <i>ghari</i>.
        They flow in order during the 60 <i>ghari</i> of a day. </p>
      <p>63. Then by a <i>ghari</i> each [24 minutes] the five <i>tatwas</i>
        flow. The days begin with the <i>pratipat</i> [the first lunar
        day]. When the order is reversed the effect is reversed. </p>
      <p>64. In the bright fortnight the left [is powerful], in the dark
        the right; let the <i>yogi</i> with attention bring these into
        order, beginning with the first lunar day. </p>
      <p>65. If the breath rises [at sunrise] by way of the moon, and
        sets in by that of the sun, it confers groups of good qualities;
        in the reverse, the reverse. </p>
      <p>66. Let the moon flow the whole day through, and the sun the
        whole night; he who practices thus is no doubt a <i>yogi</i>. </p>
      <p>67. The moon is checked by the sun, the sun by the moon; he who
        knows this practice, tramples in a moment over the three worlds.
      </p>
      <p>68. During Thursdays, Fridays, Wednesdays and Mondays the left
        <i>Nadi</i> gives success in all acts, especially in the white
        fortnight. </p>
      <p>69. During Sundays, Tuesdays and Saturdays the right <i>Nadi</i>
        gives success in all harsh acts, especially in the black
        fortnight. </p>
      <p>70. During the five <i>gharis</i> each, the <i>tatwas</i>
        have their distinct rise in order, <i>ghari</i> by <i>ghari</i>.
      </p>
      <p>71. Thus there are twelve changes during the day and night. The
        Taurus, Cancer, Virgo, Scorpio, Capricorn, and Pisces are in the
        moon [i.e., the breath rises in the left <i>Nadi</i> in these
        signs]. </p>
      <p>72. During Aries, Gemini, Leo, Libra, Sagittarius, and Aquarius
        the rise of the breath is in the right <i>Nadi</i>. From this
        good or bad is ascertained. </p>
      <p>73. The sun is centered in the east and north, the moon in the
        west and south. Let none go west and south during the flow of
        the right <i>Nadi</i>. </p>
      <p>74. Let none go east and north during the flow of the left <i>Nadi</i>;
        if anyone does go, he will have the fear of robbers and will not
        return. </p>
      <p>75. The wise who desire good might not therefore go in these
        directions during these intervals; then there doubtlessly will
        be suffering and death. </p>
      <p>76. When the moon flows during the bright fortnight, it is
        beneficial to the man; comfort is caused in mild deeds. </p>
      <p>77. When the moon rises at the time of the rise of breath, and
        vice versa, quarrel and danger make appearance, and all good
        disappears. </p>
      <p><b>The Wrong <i>Swara</i> ~</b> </p>
      <p>78. When in the morning the wrong breath takes its rise, that
        is the sun in place of the moon, and the moon in place of the
        sun, then: </p>
      <p>79. During the first day the mind is confused; during the
        second loss of wealth; during the third they speak of motion;
        during the fourth the destruction of the desired [object]. </p>
      <p>80. During the fifth the destruction of worldly position;
        during the sixth the destruction of all objects; during the
        seventh disease and pain; during the eight, death. </p>
      <p>81. When for these eight days, at all the three times, the
        breath is wrong, then the effect is simply bad. When there is
        something less there is some good. </p>
      <p>82. When in the morning and the noon there is the moon, and in
        the evening the sun, then there is always success and benefit.
        The reverse gives pain. </p>
      <p>83. Whenever the breath is in the right or the left <i>Nadi</i>,
        the journey will be successful if the right or the left, as the
        case may be, is the first step. </p>
      <p>84. Going four steps [by the left step first] when the moon
        flows, and five steps [by the right step first] when the sun
        flows, causes success all over the three worlds. </p>
      <p>85. One must go on an even number of steps during the moon, and
        an odd one during the sun, raising first the foot [belong to
        the] full <i>Nadi</i>. </p>
      <p>86. If by the hand of that part of the body in which the breath
        might be flowing at the time of waking, one touches his face, he
        is successful in his desires. </p>
      <p>87. In taking a thing from another, and in going out of the
        house, we take by the hand in whose corresponding half the <i>Nadi</i>
        flows, and begin motion by raising the same foot. </p>
      <p>88. There will be no confusion, no quarrel, no piercing with
        thorns; he will come back comfortable and free from all
        accidents. </p>
      <p>89. Those who desire success in their undertakings must talk
        with teachers, relations, kings, and ministers and others who
        can fulfill one’s desires, keeping them towards the full half of
        the body. </p>
      <p>90. Those who desire success, benefit, and comfort must talk
        with enemies, thieves, creditors, and such others, keeping them
        towards the empty half of the body. </p>
      <p>91. To distant countries one must go during the moon; to rather
        near countries during the sun. </p>
      <p>92. Whatever of income, etc., and comings together, has been
        described before, comes to pass without doubt in the <i>Nadis</i>
        notices before. </p>
      <p>93. Whatever has been said before to be the effect of the empty
        <i>Nadi</i>, is all in accordance with what has been said by the
        omniscient. </p>
      <p>94. All transactions or dealings with bad men where there is
        enmity or deceit, angry lords or thieves, etc., are dangerous
        towards the full half of the body. </p>
      <p>95. In going on a distant journey, the moon is auspicious, and
        gives ceaseless success in the aim; the sun is good in coming
        in, and in the beginning of any hasty work. </p>
      <p>96. During the flow of the moon, poison is destroyed; during
        that of the sun, power is obtained over any body. During the <i>susumna</i>
        salvation is obtained. One power stands in three forms: the sun,
        the moon, and the <i>susumna</i>. </p>
      <p>97. It might happen that when something is to be done, the
        breath is not rightly flowing, or conversely, when the breath is
        flowing as it ought to be, there is no occasion for the action
        to be done. How then is a man of business to follow the
        promptings of <i>prana</i>? </p>
      <p>98. Auspicious or inauspicious acts are always to be done day
        and night. When need be the proper <i>Nadi</i> is to be set in
        motion. </p>
      <p><b>The <i>Ida</i> ~</b> </p>
      <p>99. In those acts which are desired to have durable effect, in
        going on a distant journey, in entering an order of life (<i>Ashrama</i>)
        or a palace, in amassing wealth; </p>
      <p>100. In sinking wells, ponds, tanks, etc, in erecting columns
        and idols, in buying utensils, in marriage, in having clothes,
        jewels and ornaments prepared; </p>
      <p>101. In preparing cooling and nourishing divine medicines, in
        seeing one’s lord, in trade, in collection of grain; </p>
      <p>102. In going into a new house, in taking charge of some
        office, in cultivation, in throwing the seed, in auspicious
        peace-making, in going out, the moon is auspicious. </p>
      <p>103. In such acts as beginning to read, etc., in seeing
        relations... in virtue, in learning from some spiritual teacher,
        in rehearsing a <i>Mantra</i>; </p>
      <p>104. In reading the aphorisms of the Science of Time, in
        bringing quadrupeds home, in the treatment of diseases, in
        calling upon masters; </p>
      <p>105. In riding horses and elephants, in doing good to others,
        in making deposits; </p>
      <p>106. In singing, in playing upon instruments, in thinking of
        the science of musical sounds, in entering any town, in
        coronation; </p>
      <p>107. In disease, sorrow, dejection, fever, and swoon, in
        establishing relations with one’s people, in entering any town
        or village, in coronation; </p>
      <p>108. In the adornment of their person by women, when the rain
        is coming, in the worship of the teacher, in preparing poisons,
        etc., O Fair One! The moon is auspicious. </p>
      <p>109. Also such acts as the practice of <i>Yoga</i> give
        success in <i>Ida</i>. Even in <i>Ida</i> let one give up the
        <i>akasa</i> and <i>taijas</i> modifications of <i>prana</i>.
      </p>
      <p>110. In day or in night all works are successful; in all
        auspicious works the flow of the moon is good. </p>
      <p><b>The <i>Pingala</i> ~</b> </p>
      <p>111. In all harsh acts, in the reading and teaching of
        difficult sciences... in getting into a ship; </p>
      <p>112. In all bad acts, in drinking, in rehearsing the <i>Mantra</i>
        of such a god as Bhairava, in administering poison to enemies; </p>
      <p>113. In learning the <i>Shastras</i>, in going, in hunting, in
        the selling of animals, in the difficult collection of bricks,
        wood, stone and jewels, etc.; </p>
      <p>114. In the practice of music, in the <i>Yantras</i> and <i>tantras</i>,
        in climbing a high place or mountain, in gambling, in theft, in
        the breaking of an elephant or a horse, in a carriage or
        otherwise. </p>
      <p>115. In riding a new donkey, camel, or buffalo, or an elephant
        or horse, in crossing a stream, in medicine, in writing; </p>
      <p>116. In athletic sports, in killing or producing confusion, in
        practicing the six <i>Karmas</i>, etc., in obtaining power of <i>Yakshinis</i>,
        <i>Yakshas</i>, <i>Vetalas</i>, Poisons and <i>Bhutas</i>,
        etc.; </p>
      <p>117. In killing, in causing love, in enmity, in mesmerizing,
        causing one to do anything at bidding, in drawing anyone towards
        anything, in causing distress and confusion, in charity, and
        buying and selling. </p>
      <p>118. In practicing with swords, in inimical battle, in amorous
        enjoyment, in seeking the king, in eating, in bathing, in
        mercantile negotiations, in harsh and hot deeds, the sun is
        auspicious. </p>
      <p>119. Just after eating, in winning the favor of women, the sun
        is auspicious. The wise ought to sleep, too, during the flow of
        the sun breath. </p>
      <p>120. All harsh acts, all those various acts which in their
        nature must be transitory and temporary, find success during the
        sun. There is no doubt in this. </p>
      <p><b>The <i>Susumna</i> ~</b> </p>
      <p>121. When the breath moves one moment in the left and the other
        in the right, the [state of <i>prana</i>] too is known a <i>susumna</i>.
        It is the destroyer of acts. </p>
      <p><i>Notes ~</i> It will be seen that in this section three
        phases of the <i>Susumna</i> have been noticed: (1) When the
        breath comes one moment out of one nostril and next out of the
        other; (2) When the breath at once flows out of both nostrils
        with equal force; (3) When the breath flows out of one nostril
        with greater force than it does out of the other. The first is
        called the Unequal state (<i>Vishamabhava</i>). The second and
        third are called the <i>Vishuvat</i> or <i>Vishuva</i>. </p>
      <p>122. When the <i>prana</i> is in that <i>Nadi</i> the fires
        of death burn. It is called <i>Vishuvat</i>, the destroyer of
        all actions. </p>
      <p>123. When both the <i>Nadis</i>, which ought to flow one after
        the other, then without doubt there is danger for him who is
        thus afflicted. </p>
      <p>124. When it is at one moment in the right, the other moment in
        the left, it is called the unequal state. The effect is the
        reverse of what is desired, and so it ought to be known, O Fair
        One! </p>
      <p>125. The wise call it <i>Vishuvat</i> when both the <i>Nadis</i>
        flow. Do neither harsh not mild acts at that time; both will be
        fruitless. </p>
      <p>126. In life, in death, in asking questions, in income, or its
        absence, in success or its want, everywhere the reverse is the
        case during the flow of the <i>Vishuvat</i>. Remember then the
        Lord of the Universe. </p>
      <p>127. The <i>Iswara</i> is to be remembered by acts such as the
        practice of <i>Yoga</i>; nothing else is to be done at that
        time by those who desire success, income and comfort. </p>
      <p>128. Pronounce a curse or benediction when with the sun the <i>Susumna</i>
        flows slowly; it will all be useless. </p>
      <p>129. When the unequal state takes rise, do not so much as think
        of journeying. Journeying during this state undoubtedly causes
        pain and death. </p>
      <p>130. When the <i>Nadi</i> changes or the tatwa changes,
        nothing auspicious shall be done by way of charity, etc. </p>
      <p>131. In the front, in the left, and above is the moon. On the
        back, on the right, and below is the sun. in this way the wise
        ought to know the distinction between the full and empty. </p>
      <p><i>Notes ~</i> Two or more phases of conjunction have been
        noticed: (1) <i>Sandhya Sandhi</i>, and (2) <i>Vedoveda</i>. </p>
      <p>According to some philosophers, these do not exist. These two
        are said to be but the names of the two foregoing ones. This,
        however, is not the thesis of the present writer. He holds that
        both these states exist separately. </p>
      <p>The <i>Sandhya Sandhi</i> is that <i>Susumna</i> through
        which disappearance takes place into the higher matter beyond.
        The physiological <i>Susumna</i> is the reservoir of man’s
        potential physiological life. From that state takes its birth
        either the positive or the negative phase of life. </p>
      <p>But the <i>Susumna</i> is the child of a higher phase of life.
        The positive and negative mental forces according to similar
        laws give birth to this potential <i>pranamaya kosha</i>. The
        world, as some writers have said, is the outcome of mental
        motion (<i>Sankala, Meinah sphurana</i>). The state of the
        conjunction of these two mental states is the <i>Sandhya Sandhi</i>.
        The same name seems to have been given to the higher <i>susumna</i>.
        When the two phases of mental matter are neutralized in the <i>Susumna</i>,
        the <i>pranamaya kosha</i> loses its vitality and disappears. </p>
      <p>This is that state in which is thrown the reflection of the
        Higher <i>Atma</i>, and from whence it is possible for it to
        come into the mind. </p>
      <p>132. The Messenger who is above, in front, or on the left, is
        in the way of the moon, and he who is below in the back and on
        the front, is in the way of the sun. </p>
      <p>133. The conjunction, which has no beginning, is One, and is
        without [potential] nourishment or confusion -- that through
        which disappearance takes place in the subtle matter beyond --
        is called <i>Sandhya Sandhi</i>. </p>
      <p>134. Some say there is no separate <i>Sandhya Sandhi</i>, but
        the state in which the <i>prana</i> is in the <i>Vishuvat</i>
        is called <i>Sandhya Sandhi</i>. </p>
      <p>135. There is no separate <i>Vedoveda</i>; it does not exist.
        That conjunction is called <i>Vedoveda</i> by which the highest
        <i>Atma</i> is known. </p>
      <p><b>The <i>Tatwas</i> ~</b> </p>
      <p>136. Said the goddess: Great Lord! God of the gods! In thy mind
        is the great secret that gives salvation to the world; tell me
        all that. </p>
      <p>137. Said the god: There is no God beyond the secret knowledge
        of breath; the <i>Yogi</i> who is devoted to the science of
        breath is the highest <i>Yogi</i>. </p>
      <p>138. Creation takes place from the five <i>tatwas</i>; the <i>tatwa</i>
        disappears in <i>tatwa</i>; the five <i>tatwas</i> constitute
        the objects of the highest knowledge; beyond the five <i>tatwas</i>
        is the Formless. </p>
      <p>139. The <i>Prithivi</i>, the <i>Apas</i>, the <i>Taijas</i>,
        the <i>Vayu</i>, and the <i>Akasa</i> are the five <i>tatwas</i>;
        everything is of the five <i>tatwas</i>. Revered is he who
        knows this. </p>
      <p>140. In the beings of all the worlds the <i>tatwas</i> are the
        same all over; from the <i>Satyaloka</i> the arrangement of <i>Nadi</i>
        only differs. </p>
      <p><i>Notes ~</i> See the Essay on the <i>Tatwas</i>. How
        everything, every possible phenomenon of the soul, the mind, the
        <i>prana</i>, and the gross matter is of the <i>tatwas</i>, the
        introductory Essays have tried to explain. </p>
      <p>The nervous system is different in all the <i>lokas</i>. It
        has been said many a time that the tatwic rays flying in every
        direction from every point give birth to innumerable <i>truti</i>
        that are minimized pictures of the macrocosm. Now it will be
        easy to understand that these pictures are formed in different
        planes, which are differently inclined to the solar axis, and
        lie at different distances from the sun. Our planet is at a
        certain distance from the sun, and life is so arranged on this
        planet that the lunar and solar life-currents must have equal
        force if the organism is to be maintained. The tatwas also must
        be balanced. There might be other planes of life in which the
        respective powers of the two currents and the tatwas might be
        greater or less than they are on the earth. This difference will
        secure a difference in the arrangements of the <i>Nadi</i>, and
        also in their shape. </p>
      <p>We experience this sort of thing even on our earth. Different
        animals and vegetables have different shapes. This is simply on
        account of the different truti stretching on different planes,
        differently inclined to the solar axis. Suppose for the sale of
        illustration that the following is the sphere of the macrocosmic
        prana: </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="prasy.jpg" height="281" width="285"></p>
      </center>
      <p>Works on astrology assign different organs to these astral
        divisions, and for the purpose of illustration I shall assume
        these without further explanation. Thus we have on a larger
        scale: </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="prasz.jpg" height="359" width="341"></p>
      </center>
      <p>These twelve regions comprehend the whole body in and out. Now
        suppose that there is a plane A-B having a certain inclination
        to the axis of the sun, S. From every point in the twelve
        regions rays fall in every <i>truti</i> of the plane A-B. Then
        there are other planes, C-D and E-F, etc. </p>
      <p>It is evident that the rays falling on all these planes from
        the twelve regions will vary in relative strength and position
        on different planes. It is evident that on all these planes the
        different organs will differ in shape, in strength, and in
        relative position. This gives birth to more or less varying
        nervous systems in all the <i>lokas</i>, and the various shapes
        of the organisms of the earth. </p>
      <p>As in evolution the necessities of the mind are changed, the <i>pranamaya




          Koshas</i> change their planes, and it is thus that they are
        changed on earth according to the occult theory of evolution. </p>
      <p>141. In the left as well as the right there is the five-fold
        rise [of the<i> tatwas</i>]. The knowledge of the <i>tatwas</i>
        is eight-fold. Hear me, O Fair One: I shall tell thee. </p>
      <p>142. The first is the number of the<i> tatwas</i>; the second
        the conjunction of breath; the third are the signs of the
        breath; the fourth the place of the<i> tatwas</i>; </p>
      <p>143. The fifth is the color of the <i>tatwas</i>; the sixth is
        the <i>prana</i> itself; the seventh is their taste; the eighth
        is their mode of vibration. </p>
      <p>144. Hear of the three-fold <i>Prana</i>: the <i>Vishuvata</i>,
        the Active [<i>chara</i>, the motor, sun], the Passive [<i>achara</i>
        or sthira, the receiver of motion, the moon] -- in these eight
        forms. There is nothing, O Lotus-Faced Goddess, beyond the
        breath. </p>
      <p>145. When by the effect of time the power of seeing does come
        it must be seen with great effort. The <i>Yogi</i> acts for the
        purpose of deceiving time. </p>
      <p><i>Notes ~</i> "The <i>Yogi</i> acts for the purpose of
        deceiving time." Time is the order of appearance of the various
        tatwic phases of a living organism. In man this order is
        regulated by his previous <i>Karma</i>. By the power of
        previous <i>Karma</i>, the human organism assumes different
        receptive states, and in accordance with the receptivity the
        tatwic influence of time -- the solar <i>prana</i> -- cause
        pains or enjoyments of different sorts. </p>
      <p>By the practice of <i>Yoga</i> the <i>Yogi</i> masters the
        tatwic changes of his body. Time is cheated. If he pushes the
        germ of disease out of his body no epidemic will ever affect
        him. </p>
      <p>146. Let a man shut his ears by his thumbs, his nostrils by the
        middle fingers, his mouth by the last fingers and those last but
        one, and his eyes by the remaining fingers. </p>
      <p>147. In this state the five <i>tatwas</i> are gradually known
        as the yellow, the white, the red, the blue, and the spotted
        without any other distinct <i>upadhi</i> [differentia]. </p>
      <p>148. Looking into a mirror, let the breath be thrown upon it;
        thus let the wise man know the difference among the <i>tatwas</i>
        by their forms. </p>
      <p>149. Quadrangular, semi-lunar, triangular, spherical, and
        spotted are respectively the forms of the five <i>tatwas</i>. </p>
      <p>150. Thus the first, <i>prithivi</i>, flows midway; the
        second, <i>apas</i>, flows downward; the third, <i>agni</i>,
        flows upwards; the fourth, <i>vayu</i>, flows at acute angles;
        the <i>akasa</i> flows between every two. </p>
      <p>151. The apas tatwa is white; the <i>prithivi</i> yellow; the
        <i>agni</i> red; the <i>vayu</i> sky-blue; the <i>akasa</i>
        foreshadows every color. </p>
      <p>152. First of all flows the <i>vayu tatwa</i>; secondly, the <i>taijas</i>;
        thirdly, the <i>prithivi</i>; and fourthly, the <i>apas</i>. </p>
      <p>153. Between the two shoulders is located <i>agni</i>; in the
        root of the navel <i>vayu</i>; in the knees the <i>apas</i>;
        in the feet the <i>prithivi</i>; in the head the <i>akasa</i>.
      </p>
      <p>154. The <i>prithivi tatwa</i> is sweet; the <i>apas</i>
        astringent; the <i>taijas</i> pungent; the <i>vayu</i> acid;
        the <i>akasa</i> bitter. </p>
      <p>155. The <i>vayu</i> flows eight fingers breadth; the <i>agni</i>
        four; the <i>prithivi</i> twelve; the <i>apas</i> sixteen. </p>
      <p>156. The upward motion tends to death; the downward to
        calmness; the one at acute angles to restlessness; the middle
        one to endurance; the <i>akasa</i> is common to all. </p>
      <p>157. During the flow of the <i>prithivi</i> are performed acts
        which are expected to live long; during the <i>apas</i> passive
        acts; during the <i>taijas</i> harsh acts; during the <i>vayu</i>,
        killing, etc. </p>
      <p>158. Nothing ought to be done during the <i>akasa</i> except
        the practice of <i>Yoga</i>; all other acts will remain without
        their desired effect. </p>
      <p>159. During the <i>prithivi</i> and the <i>apas</i> success
        is obtained ; death comes in the <i>taijas</i>; reduction in
        the <i>vayu</i>. The <i>akasa</i> is known by the tatwic
        philosophers to be altogether useless. </p>
      <p>160. During the <i>prithivi</i> income is late; during the <i>apas</i>,
        immediate; loss comes into existence by the <i>taijas</i> and
        the <i>vayu</i>; <i>akasa</i> is altogether useless. </p>
      <p>161. The <i>prithivi tatwa</i> is yellow, has slow motion,
        moves in the middle, comes in its flow up to the end of the
        sternum, is heavy in sound, has slight heat in temperature. It
        gives success in works that are expected to stay long. </p>
      <p>162. The <i>apas tatwa</i> is white, has rapid motion, moves
        downwards, comes in its flow sixteen fingers downward [up to the
        navel], is heavy in sound, is cool in temperature. </p>
      <p>163. The <i>taijas tatwa</i> is red, moves in whirls [<i>avartagah</i>],
moves




        upwards, comes in its flow four fingers downwards [up to the end
        of the chin], is very high in temperature. It gives birth to
        harsh actions [actions which, so to speak, set one on fire]. </p>
      <p>164. The <i>vayu tatwa</i> is sky-blue, moves at acute angles,
        comes in flow eight fingers downward, is hot or cool in
        temperature. It gives success in those works that are
        transitory. </p>
      <p>165. The <i>akasa tatwa</i> is the common surface of all,
        foreshadows the qualities of all the <i>tatwas</i>. It gives <i>yoga</i>
        to the <i>yogi</i>. </p>
      <p>166. Yellow and quadrangular, sweet and moving in the middle,
        and the giver of enjoyment is the <i>prithivi tatwa</i>, which
        flows twelve fingers downwards. </p>
      <p>167. White, semi-lunar, astringent, moving downwards, and the
        causer of benefit is the <i>apas tatwa</i>, which is sixteen
        fingers in flow. </p>
      <p>168. --- </p>
      <p>169. Blue, spherical, acid, moving at acute angles, the giver
        of locomotion is the <i>vayu tatwa</i>, which is eight fingers
        in flow. </p>
      <p>170. Foreshadowing all colors, of the shape of an ear, bitter
        in taste, moving everywhere through the giver of <i>Moksha</i>
        is the <i>akasa tatwa</i>, which is useless in all worldly
        works. </p>
      <p>171. The <i>prithivi</i> and the <i>apas</i> are auspicious <i>tatwas</i>,
        the <i>taijas</i> is middling in its effects, the <i>akasa</i>
        and <i>vayu</i> are inauspicious and cause loss and death to
        mankind. </p>
      <p>172. The <i>apas tatwa</i> is in the east; the <i>prithivi</i>
        in the west; the <i>vayu</i> in the north; the <i>taijas</i>
        in the south; the <i>akasa</i> in the middle corners. </p>
      <p>173. When the <i>prithivi</i> and the <i>apas</i> are in the
        moon, and the <i>agni</i> in the sun, then there is doubtless
        success in mild and harsh acts respectively. </p>
      <p>174. The <i>prithivi</i> causes income during the day, the <i>apas</i>
        during the night; death comes in the <i>taijas</i>; reduction
        in the <i>vayu</i>; the <i>akasa</i> sometimes burns. </p>
      <p>175. In fitness for living, in success, in income, in
        cultivation [or: in enjoyment and growth], in amassing wealth,
        in understanding the meaning of the <i>mantras</i>, in
        questions about battle, in coming and going; </p>
      <p>176. Benefit results during the <i>apas tatwa</i>; auspicious
        stay wherever it is during the <i>prithivi</i>; by the <i>vayu</i>
        they go away elsewhere; the <i>akasa</i> and the <i>taijas</i>
        cause loss and death. </p>
      <p>177. In the <i>prithivi</i> comes the thought of roots [<i>Mala</i>];
in




        the <i>apas</i> and the <i>vayu</i> that of living things; in
        the <i>taijas</i> comes the thought of minerals; in the <i>akasa</i>
        there is void. </p>
      <p>178. In the <i>prithivi</i> one thinks of beings of many feet;
        in the <i>apas</i> and <i>vayu</i> of bipeds; in the <i>taijas</i>
        of quadrupeds; in the <i>akasa</i> of the footless. </p>
      <p>179. Mars is said to be the <i>taijas</i>, the Sun the <i>prithivi</i>,
        Saturn the <i>apas</i>, and the <i>Rahu</i> the <i>vayu </i>in




        the right <i>Nadi</i>. </p>
      <p>180. The Moon is in the <i>apas</i>, Jupiter the <i>prithivi</i>,
        Mercury the <i>vayu</i>, and Venus the <i>taijas</i> in the
        left <i>Nadi</i>; for all acts doubtless. </p>
      <p><i>Notes ~</i> The tatwic value of the planets described in
        these two verses seems to be the opinion of only a few. The
        opinion of the writer, which is also the opinion of the great
        astrologer Varahamchira, is expressed in stanza 181. </p>
      <p>181. Jupiter is the <i>prithivi</i>; the Moon and Venus are
        the <i>apas</i>; the Sun and Mars are the <i>taijas</i>; the
        Dragon, the <i>Ketu</i>, and Saturn are <i>Vayu</i>; Mercury
        is the <i>akasa</i>. </p>
      <p>182. Say during the <i>prithivi</i> the question that is about
        earthly things [roots, <i>mala</i>]; during the <i>apas</i>
        about life; during the <i>taijas</i> about minerals; during the
        <i>akasa</i> nothing. </p>
      <p>183. Leaving the Sun and the Moon, when the breath goes to the
        <i>Rahu</i> know that it [<i>prana</i>] is in motion and desires
        another place. </p>
      <p>184. (1) Pleasure, 92) growth, (3) affection, (4) playfulness,
        (5) success, (6) laughing, (7) in the <i>prithivi</i> and the <i>apas</i>;
        want of power in the organs, (8) fever, (9) trembling, (10)
        going out of one’s country in the <i>taijas</i> and <i>vayu</i>.
      </p>
      <p>185. (11) Loss of the life, substance, (12) and death in the <i>akasa</i>
        -- these twelve are the phases of the moon [i.e., the forms,
        etc., that the negative matter assumes]; they ought always to be
        known with pains by the wise. </p>
      <p><i>Notes ~</i> These twelve are the phases of the moon. The
        moon here means the power that gives sustenance to names and
        forms. That power, the <i>rayi</i>, appears in twelve forms,
        according to tatwic changes. The flow of the left <i>Nadi</i>
        in its diurnal course is not meant here. </p>
      <p>186. In the East, the West, the South, and the North, the <i>tatwas</i>,
        <i>prithivi</i>, etc., are powerful, so let it be said. </p>
      <p>187. Fair One, the body must be known as made of the five <i>Mahabhutas</i>:
        the <i>prithivi</i>, the <i>apas</i>, the <i>taijas</i>, the
        <i>vayu</i>, and the <i>akasa</i>. </p>
      <p>188. Bone, muscle, skin, <i>Nadi</i> and hair: these are the
        fivefold <i>prithivi</i> as laid down by the <i>Brahmavidya</i>
        [the divine science]. </p>
      <p>189. The semen, the female genital fluid, fat, urine and
        saliva: these are the fivefold <i>apas</i> as laid down by the
        <i>Brahmavidya</i>. </p>
      <p>190. Hunger, thirst, sleep, light, drowsiness: these are the
        fivefold <i>agni</i> as laid down by the <i>Brahmavidya</i>. </p>
      <p>191. Removing, walking, smelling, contraction and inflation:
        these are the fivefold <i>vayu</i> as laid down by the <i>Brahmavidya</i>.
      </p>
      <p>192. Desire to have, desire to repel, shame, fear and
        forgetfulness: these are the fivefold <i>akasa</i> as laid down
        by the divine science. </p>
      <p>193. The <i>prithivi</i> has five qualities, the <i>apas</i>
        four, the <i>taijas</i> three, the <i>vayu</i> two, the <i>akasa</i>
        one. This is a portion of tatwic knowledge. </p>
      <p>194. The <i>prithivi</i> is 50 <i>pala</i> [<i>pala</i> = 1/3
        ounce], the <i>apas</i> 40; the <i>taijas</i> 30; the <i>vayu</i>
        20; the <i>akasa</i> 10. </p>
      <p>195. In the <i>prithivi</i> income is delayed; in the <i>apas</i>
        it comes at once; in the <i>vayu</i> it is very little; in the
        <i>agni</i> even what is at hand is destroyed. </p>
      <p>196. [The lunar mansions] (1) <i>Dhanestha</i>, (2) <i>Rohini</i>,
        (3) <i>Jyestha</i>, (4) <i>Anaradha</i>, (5) <i>Srawana</i>,
        (6) <i>Abhiji</i>, and (7) <i>Uttarashadh</i>: these are said
        to be the <i>prithivi tatwa</i>. </p>
      <p>197. (1) <i>Bharani</i>, (2) <i>Krithka</i>, (3) <i>Pushya</i>,
        (4) <i>Magha</i>, (5) <i>Purvaphalguni</i>, (6) <i>Purvabhadrapada</i>,
        and (7) <i>Swath</i>: these are said to be the <i>taijas tatwa</i>.
      </p>
      <p>198. (1) <i>Purva shada</i>, (2) <i>Shelesha</i>, (3) <i>Mula</i>,
        (4) <i>Ardra</i>, (5) <i>Revati</i>, (6) <i>Uttara bhadrapada</i>,
        and (7) <i>Satabhisha</i>: these are the <i>apas tatwa</i>, O
        Beloved! </p>
      <p>199. (1) <i>Vishakha</i>, (2) <i>Uttaragphalguni</i>, (3) <i>Hasta</i>,
        (4) <i>Chitra</i>, (5) <i>Punarvasu</i>. (6) <i>Ashwani</i>,
        and (7) <i>Mrigashirsha</i>: these are the <i>vayu tatwa</i>.
      </p>
      <p>200. Whatever good or bad the messenger asks about, standing
        towards the flowing <i>Nadi</i>, comes not to pass as he
        desires. In the empty <i>Nadi</i> it is the reverse. </p>
      <p>201. Even when the <i>Nadi</i> is full, but the tatwa is not
        congenial, there is no success. The sun or the moon gives
        success only when combines with the congenial <i>tatwa</i>. </p>
      <p>202. Rama got victory in an auspicious <i>tatwa</i>; so did
        Arjuna. The Kauravas were all killed in battle on account of the
        antagonistic <i>tatwa</i>. </p>
      <p>203. By the acquired velocity of other births, or by the
        kindness of the <i>guru</i>, some men come to know the nature
        of the <i>tatwas</i> by a mind purified by habituation. </p>
      <p><b>The Meditation of the Five <i>Tatwas</i> ~</b> </p>
      <p>204. Meditate upon the <i>prithivi tatwa</i> with L [or <i>Lam</i>]
        as its algebraic symbol, as being quadrangular, yellow,
        sweet-smelling, and conferring a color as pure as that of gold,
        freedom from disease and lightness of the body. </p>
      <p>205. Mediate upon the <i>apas tatwa</i> with V [or <i>Vam</i>]
        as its algebraic symbol, as being semi-lunar, white as the moon,
        and giving endurance of hunger and thirst, etc., and producing a
        sensation similar to that of a plunge in water. </p>
      <p>206. Meditate upon the <i>taijas tatwa</i> with R [or <i>Ram</i>]
        as the algebraic symbol, as being triangular, red, and giving
        the power of consuming a good deal of food and drink, and the
        endurance of burning heat. </p>
      <p>207. Meditate upon the <i>vayu tatwa</i> with P [or <i>Pam</i>]
        as the algebraic symbol, as being spherical, sky-blue, and
        giving the power of going into the space, and flying like bird.
      </p>
      <p>208. Meditate upon the <i>akasa tatwa</i> with H [or <i>Ham</i>]
        as the algebraic symbol, formless, foreshadowing many colors,
        and as giving the knowledge of the three times, and the powers
        Anima, etc. </p>
      <p>209. Where there is a man who knows the science of breath,
        there can be no wealth better than him. It is known that by the
        Knowledge of breath one gets good fruit without much ado. </p>
      <p><b>The Auspicious Victory ~</b> </p>
      <p>210. Great Lord! The god of gods, the giver of happiness, the
        science of the rise of breath is a very high science; how does
        it comprehend the Knowledge of the three times? </p>
      <p>211. Said the god: Fair one! The knowledge of three times
        refers to three things, and nothing else: (1) Fortune, (2)
        Victory in battle, and (3) Good or bad [end of other actions]. </p>
      <p>212. On account of the <i>tatwa</i> any act is good or bad in
        effect; on account of the <i>tatwa</i> comes victory or
        discomfiture; on account of the <i>tatwa</i> comes scarcity and
        wealth. The <i>tatwas</i> are said to show themselves in these
        three states. </p>
      <p>213. Said the goddess: Great Lord! The god of gods, the
        all-comprehending ocean of this world is the greatest friend and
        help-mate of men, he who causes the fulfillment of all his
        works? </p>
      <p>214. Siva said: The <i>Prana</i> alone is the highest friend,
        the <i>Prana</i> is the greatest helpmate, Fair one! There is
        no friend better than <i>Prana</i>. </p>
      <p>215. Said the goddess: How does the force of <i>Prana</i>
        stand in the body? What is the appearance of <i>Prana</i> in
        the body? How is the <i>Prana</i> known by the <i>Yogi</i> to
        be acting in the <i>tatwas</i>? </p>
      <p>216. Siva said: In the city of the body the <i>Prana</i> is
        the Lord Protector; while going in, it is 10 fingers; while
        going out, 12. </p>
      <p><i>Notes ~</i> This section refers to the human Aura. The
        subtle <i>Prana</i> surrounds the gross human body like a halo
        of light. The natural length from the body to the circumference
        of this halo is 12 fingers of the man whose <i>Prana</i> is
        measured. This length is affected during the ordinary course of
        inspiration and expiration. At the time of inspiration the
        length is reduced to 10 fingers; at the time of expiration it is
        restored to 12. During certain other actions too, the length
        varies. Thus, in walking the length of <i>Prana</i> becomes 24;
        in running, 42. </p>
      <p>In cohabitation it becomes 65; in sleeping, 100. In eating and
        speaking, it becomes 18. </p>
      <p>In ordinary men, the length is 12 fingers. The ordinary length
        is, however, reduced in extraordinary men. Thus, in those men
        who are free from desire, the length of <i>Prana</i> is reduced
        by one finger; it becomes 11. In men who are always pleasant,
        always hilarious, the length is 10 fingers. A poet has 9
        fingers. A speaker has 8. A ser has s <br>
        7. A levitator has 6, and so on. See the following stanzas. </p>
      <p>217. In walking it is 24 fingers, in running 42; in
        cohabitation 65; in sleeping 100 fingers. </p>
      <p>218. The natural length of <i>Prana</i>, my goddess, is 12
        fingers. In eating and speaking it stretches to 18 fingers. </p>
      <p>219. When the <i>Prana</i> is reduced by one finger, freedom
        from desire is the result. Pleasure results when it is reduced
        by 2; poetical power when by 3; </p>
      <p>220. Power of speech when by 4; second sight when by 5;
        levitation when by 6; great rapidity when by 7; </p>
      <p>221. The eight <i>siddhi</i> when by 8; the nine niddhis when
        by 9; the ten figures when by 10, the loss of the shadow when by
        11; </p>
      <p>222. When it is reduced by 12 the inspiratory and expiratory
        motions drink of the fountain of immortality at the sun [the
        center of <i>Prana</i>]. When the <i>prana</i> fills the body
        up to the end of nails even, for whom else then is food? </p>
      <p>223. Thus has been described the law of <i>prana</i>. It can
        be known by the teaching of a guru, not by millions of sciences
        and <i>shastra</i>. </p>
      <p>224. If the moon does not set in by chance in the morning, and
        the sun in the evening, they do so respectively after midday and
        midnight. </p>
      <p><b>The Battle ~</b> </p>
      <p>225. In distant warfare the moon is victorious; in near places
        the sun. When the foot is raised first in going belongs to the
        flowing <i>Nadi</i>, complete success is the result. </p>
      <p>226. In beginning a journey, in marriage, in entering any town,
        etc., in all auspicious acts, the flow of the moon is good. </p>
      <p>227. Putting the enemy’s army towards the empty <i>Nadi</i>,
        and one’s own towards the full, when the tatwa is congenial, one
        might conquer the whole world. </p>
      <p>228. Let one give battle in the direction towards which the
        breath flows; victory is certain, even if Indra is in front. </p>
      <p>229. If a man puts a question about battle, he will win if he
        is towards the flowing <i>Nadi</i>, lose if he is towards the
        other. </p>
      <p>230. The <i>prithivi tatwa</i> points to wounds in the belly,
        the <i>apas</i> in the feet; the <i>agni</i> in the thighs;
        the <i>vayu</i> in the hands. </p>
      <p>231. The <i>akasa</i> in the head. These fivefold wounds have
        been described in the Science of Breath. </p>
      <p>232. He whose name has even letters wins, if he asks the
        question during the flow of the moon. He who has an odd number
        of letters in his name wins if he asks the question during the
        flow of the sun. </p>
      <p>233. When the question is put during the moon there will be a
        peaceful termination; during the sun the fight must come. </p>
      <p>234. During the <i>prithivi tatwa</i>, the fight will be
        equal. During the apas the result will be equal. During the <i>taijas</i>
        there will be defeat. During the <i>vayu</i> and the <i>akasa</i>
        death will ensue. </p>
      <p>235. When by some cause the flow of the breath is not clearly
        felt at the time of the question, let the wise man resort to the
        following expedient; </p>
      <p>236. Sitting motionless let him have a flower thrown upon
        himself. The flower will fall on the full side. So let him give
        the answer. </p>
      <p>237. Here or elsewhere the knower of the laws of breath is very
        powerful; who is more powerful than he? </p>
      <p>238. Said the goddess: These are the laws of victory when men
        fight among themselves; how does victory come when they fight
        with Yama [the god of death]? </p>
      <p>239. Let him meditate upon the Lord when the <i>prana</i> is
        calm; during the flow of the moon and then give up life when
        after that the two <i>pranas</i> coincide. He will have what he
        desires: great benefit and success. </p>
      <p>240. The whole unmanifested world has come out of the
        unmanifested. That manifested world disappears in the
        unmanifested when the fact is known. </p>
      <p><b>How To Produce Sexual Attachment ~</b> </p>
      <p>241. Said the goddess: Great Lord! Thou hast given a
        description of the battle among men, and with Death; tell me now
        how to produce attachment between the sexes. </p>
      <p>242. Said the god: It has been said by the <i>Yogis</i> that
        if one places himself in the sphere of <i>prana</i>, by drawing
        the moon with the sun, the female will be eternally attached. </p>
      <p><i>Notes ~</i> The sphere of <i>Prana</i> means the halo of
        this force which surrounds the gross body. At the time when the
        male <i>prana</i> has the pure color of the sun, and the female
        that of the moon, let the two halos be brought together. They
        are at that moment in their own element. As the two halos come
        together, they all exchange color. With a certain amount of
        natural satisfaction the individual sun will contract the habit
        of being satisfied by the individual female <i>prana</i>, and
        vice versa. This must of course be repeated for some time in
        order to give each of the two <i>pranas</i> the permanent color
        of the other. One more thing must be done. Any antagonistic
        colors must not be allowed to take even the slightest hold of
        either of these <i>pranas</i>. If this is done the two will
        learn to repel each other, and instead of attachment enmity will
        result. </p>
      <p>243. The <i>prana</i> is caught by the <i>prana</i> if the <i>prana</i>
        does give himself up. When the <i>prana</i> goes in the place
        of the <i>prana</i>, short life is destroyed. </p>
      <p><i>Notes ~</i> The first and third pranas in the verse mean
        either the male or the female, while the second means the
        reverse of either. It means that the male or female prana takes
        with its substance the female or male <i>prana</i>, if either
        of the latter allow. This permission must have two phases. There
        must be a willing mind, otherwise an antagonistic color will be
        introduced and consequent repulsion. </p>
      <p>There must also be an active throwing out of any antagonistic
        colors that might be present in the <i>prana</i>, and also a
        shutting up of both mind and prana against any antagonistic
        influences. </p>
      <p>When the male or female <i>prana</i> goes in the place of,
        i.e., is saturated in the female or male <i>prana</i>, life is
        at an end. The negative <i>prana</i> gives general strength to
        positive and vice versa. Strength causes long life. But in order
        to receive length of life there must be a complete saturation,
        which is impossible with the presence in any one of these <i>pranas</i>
        of any other antagonistic <i>prana</i>. </p>
      <p>244-249. --- </p>
      <p>250. When in the beginning of the monthly period the males have
        the sun and the females the moon, even the barren woman gets a
        child. </p>
      <p>251. In questions about the result of a pregnancy, a female
        child is born if the moon be flowing; a male during the flow of
        the sun. If both are flowing, the fetus will be destroyed. </p>
      <p>252. At the time of this question, when the messenger is
        towards the moon, a female child is born; when towards the sun,
        a male child; when in the middle, a hermaphrodite. When he is
        towards the full <i>Nadi</i> a son is born. </p>
      <p>253. The <i>prithivi</i> brings a son; the <i>apas</i> a son;
        in <i>vayu</i> comes a girl; in the <i>taijas</i> the fetus is
        destroyed; the <i>akasa</i> brings a hermaphrodite. </p>
      <p>254. When the nostril is empty, nothing is born; when two <i>tatwas</i>
        join, twins are born. When one is passing into another, the
        fetus is destroyed. When this happens during the flow of the
        moon, the result is a female child; when the sun, a male. </p>
      <p>255. During the <i>vishuvu</i> conjunction the fetus is
        destroyed, or a hermaphrodite is born. Fair One! I tell thee,
        the knower of the <i>tatwas</i> can know all this. </p>
      <p>256. When at the time of conception the <i>vayu tatwa</i>
        flows, the child will be a sufferer; when the <i>apas tatwa</i>
        flows, the child will be happy and renowned. When the <i>taijas
          tatwa</i> flows, the fetus is destroyed, or the child is
        short-lived. When the <i>prithivi tatwa</i> flows, the child is
        wealthy and full of enjoyment. </p>
      <p>257. During the <i>apas tatwa</i> the child that is conceived
        is always wealthy, happy, and full of enjoyment. During the <i>akasa</i>
        the fetus is destroyed. </p>
      <p>258. During the <i>prithivi</i> a son is born, during the <i>apas</i>
        a girl. During other <i>tatwas</i> either the fetus is
        destroyed or the child is short-lived. </p>
      <p><i>Notes ~</i> These two stanzas (253, 258) seem at first sight
        to record different truths. But they refer to different <i>pranas</i>:
        the one to the positive, the other to the negative. </p>
      <p>259. Children are born when the sun goes into the moon and the
        moon goes into the sun. This can be easily known from a teacher,
        not by millions of sciences and shastras. </p>
      <p><i>Notes ~</i> The female cells in the ovary are the moon. They
        have the capability of being impressed into any form by the male
        cells, the sun. The semen is hotter than the germ cells of the
        female. As the former act upon the latter, these expand. The
        former only act upon the latter when these present themselves to
        them; this is expressed by saying that the sun enters the moon,
        and the moon enters the sun. When both of these thus enter each
        other, the female matter that receives constant nourishment by
        the help of the Power <i>KundAlini</i> begins to expand along
        the lines stretched for it by the inherent power of the sun. In
        the semen lies hidden the future man, just as a tree in the
        seed. This is a veritable picture of the sun, or we might say a
        macrocosmic <i>prana</i>. The semen virile is, in fact, the
        mirror in which on account of tatwic affinity is reflected the
        individual <i>truti</i>, with which the reader must now be
        familiar. The semen thus is the reservoir of the whole <i>pranamaya



          Kosha</i>. </p>
      <p><b>The Year ~</b> </p>
      <p>260. On the first lunar day of the white fortnight of the month
        of <i>Chaitra</i>, let the wise yogi see both the northward and
        southward journey of the sun by an analysis of the <i>tatwas</i>.
      </p>
      <p><i>Notes ~</i> On this day begins the <i>sanwat</i> year of
        the era of King Vikramaditya. </p>
      <p>261. If at the time of the rise of the moon, the <i>prithivi</i>,
        the <i>apas</i>, or the <i>vayu taTwa</i> is flowing, all
        kinds of grain will be plentiful. </p>
      <p>262. The flow of the <i>taijas</i> and the <i>akasa</i> gives
        fearful famines. This is the nature of Time. In this way is
        known the effect of Time in the year, the month, and the day. </p>
      <p>263. If the <i>susumna</i>, which is bad in all worldly
        concerns, is flowing, there will be confusion in the land,
        subversion of the kingdom, or fear thereof, epidemic, and all
        sorts of diseases. </p>
      <p>264. When the sun passes into Aries, let the <i>yogi</i>
        meditate upon the breath and, finding out the prevalent <i>tatwa</i>,
        tell the world what will be the nature of the next year. </p>
      <p><i>Notes ~</i> On this day the solar year begins. The tatwic
        color of the Universal <i>Prana</i>, the External one, is
        determined at any time by the positions of the sun and moon and
        by those of the planets, whose presence exercises a very potent
        influence upon the tatwic value of any moment. This tatwic value
        changes according to a universal law. </p>
      <p>If at any time the <i>apas tatwa</i> is flowing, it can never
        abruptly change into the <i>taijas</i>, but must do so grade by
        grade. These atmospheric <i>taijas</i> run many minor courses.
        Hence it is possible, though extremely difficult and
        complicated, to calculate from the tatwic value of one moment
        the tatwic value of any future moment. </p>
      <p>The living world is always affected by these tatwic changes. In
        the act of breathing nature has furnished a very exact and
        faithful scale for the measurement of tatwic changes. Hence the
        <i>yogi</i>, who can live in conformity with time and space, can
        foretell the future very easily. Ah! But how very difficult it
        is to live in perfect harmony with time and space! </p>
      <p>265. The good aspect of the year, the month, and the day is
        known by the <i>tatwas</i>, <i>prithivi</i>, etc., and the bad
        one by the <i>akasa</i> and the <i>vayu</i>. </p>
      <p>266. If the <i>prithivi tatwa</i> flows there will be plenty
        and prosperity in the kingdom, and the earth will be full of
        good crops; there will be much comfort and enjoyment. </p>
      <p>267. If the <i>apas tatwa</i> flows there will be plenty of
        rain, plenty of grain, great comfort, and well-grown fields. </p>
      <p>268. If the <i>agni tatwa</i> flows there will be famine,
        subversion, or fear thereof; there will be fearful epidemics and
        the least possible rain. </p>
      <p>269. If the <i>vayu tatwa</i> flows when the sun goes into
        Aries, there will be confusion, accidents, famine, little rain,
        or the itis [six afflictions that distress crops: too much rain,
        etc.]. </p>
      <p>270. If the <i>akasa tatwa</i> flows when the sun goes into
        Aries, there will be want of grain and comfort. </p>
      <p>271. When the full breath is in its own proper place, with its
        own proper <i>tatwa</i>, success of all sorts is the result. If
        the sun and the moon are the reverse, grain must be laid up
        [against a scarcity]. </p>
      <p>272. If the <i>agni tatwa</i> flows there will be inequality
        of prices; if <i>akasa</i>, there will be continuous scarcity.
        Let things be laid up then; there will be a rise in the prices
        two months thereafter. </p>
      <p>273. When the breath is changing into the sun it gives birth to
        fearful diseases. When the <i>akasa</i> and the <i>vayu</i>
        are conjoined with the <i>taijas</i>, the earth will become the
        picture of hell. </p>
      <p><i>Notes ~</i> The disturbance of tatwic balance is disease;
        hence every <i>tatwa</i> has its own diseases. </p>
      <p><b>The Diseased ~</b> </p>
      <p>274. In the <i>prithivi tatwa</i> there is its own disease; in
        the <i>apas</i> the disease of the same <i>tatwa</i>; and so
        in the <i>taijas</i>, the <i>vayu</i>, and the <i>akasa</i>,
        similar and hereditary diseases. </p>
      <p><i>Notes ~</i> When two men come together their <i>pranas</i>
        exchange color. It is on this account that you can measure from
        the momentary reflection in your own body the color of any other
        man that is near you. The present of every man is the father of
        is future. Hence you can predict the end of any disease, or the
        time of death. </p>
      <p>All that has been ascertained to be true on these heads has
        been described in the various sections of this book. </p>
      <p>The "messenger" in 275 is the man who comes to ask questions
        about anything. </p>
      <p>275. When the messenger comes first towards the empty half of
        the body, and then towards the full half, he about whom the
        question is put will surely live, even if he is [apparently]
        lying in the swoon [of death]. </p>
      <p>276. If the question is put to the <i>yogi</i> while sitting
        in the same direction with the patient, he will live even though
        many a disease might have gathered strength in his body. </p>
      <p>277. When the breath is in the right nostril, and the messenger
        speaks of his afflictions in piteous accents, the patient will
        live. </p>
      <p>278. If the question is asked while holding the picture of the
        patient towards the <i>prana</i> and looking at it, the patient
        will live. </p>
      <p>279. When during the flow of the sun or the moon, the <i>yogi</i>
        gets into a carriage and the question is put to him while there,
        the message will have success in his desire. </p>
      <p>280. When at the time of the question the <i>yogi</i> sits
        upstairs while the patient is downstairs, he will certainly
        live. If the patient is upstairs, he will certainly go to the
        house of Yama [the god of death]. </p>
      <p>281. If at the time of the question the messenger is towards
        the empty nostril, he will have success. If the reverse is the
        case, the result too is the reverse. </p>
      <p>282. When the patient is towards the moon and the asker towards
        the sun the patient will certainly die, even if he is surrounded
        by hundreds of physicians. </p>
      <p>283. When the patient is towards the sun, and the asker towards
        the moon, then too the patient dies, even if Sambhu be his
        protector. </p>
      <p>284. When one <i>tatwa</i> is out of its proper time, people
        are subdued by disease; when two are wrong, they cause
        misfortune to friends and relation; if it is out of place for
        two fortnights death is the result. </p>
      <p><b>The Prediction of Death ~</b> </p>
      <p>285. In the beginning of a month, a fortnight, and a year, let
        the wise man try to find out the time of death from the
        movements of <i>prana</i>. </p>
      <p>286. The lamp of the five <i>tatwas</i> receives its oil from
        the moon. Protect it from the solar fire; life will thereby
        become long and stationary. </p>
      <p>287. If by mastering the flow of breath, the sun is kept in
        check, life is prolonged. Even solar time is cheated. </p>
      <p>288. The moon falls from heaven giving the nectar of life to
        the lotuses of the body. By the constant practice of good
        actions and <i>yoga</i> one becomes immortal by the lunar
        nectar. </p>
      <p>289. Make the sun flow during the day, the sun during the
        night. He who practices thus is doubtless a true <i>yogi</i>. </p>
      <p>290. If for one night and day continuously the breath flows in
        one <i>Nadi</i>, full three years will bring death. </p>
      <p>291. He whose breath flows by the <i>Pingala</i> two whole
        days and nights continuously has, as the knowers of the tatwas
        say, two years more to live. </p>
      <p>292. If the moon flows continuously during the night and the
        sun during the day, death will come within six months. </p>
      <p>293. When the sun flows altogether, and the moon is not
        altogether seen, death comes by a fortnight. So says the science
        of death. </p>
      <p>294. He whose breath flows from one nostril for three nights
        continuously has, so say the wise, a year only to live. </p>
      <p>295. Take a vessel of the Kansya alloy. Fill it with water, and
        see in it the reflection of the sun. If in the midst of the
        reflection is seen a hole, the seer will die within ten days. If
        the reflection is smoky, death will come the same day. If it is
        seen towards the south, West and North respectively, death will
        come within six, two and three months. Thus has been described
        the measure of life by the omniscient. </p>
      <p>296. [If a man sees the figure of the messengers of death he is
        sure to die]. The messenger of death has red or reddish clothes,
        matted hair, diseased teeth, oil-besmeared body, a weeping and
        red-hot face, a body besmeared with ashes, flying flames of
        fire, having heavy long rods, and standing towards the empty <i>Nadi</i>.
      </p>
      <p>297. When the skin is cool but the inside is hot, death must
        come within a month. </p>
      <p>298. When a man changes suddenly and unaccountably from good
        habits to bad, or from bad habits to good, he is sure to die. </p>
      <p>299. He whose breath that comes out of the nose is cool, but
        that which comes out of the mouth is hot like fire, is sure to
        die of great heat. </p>
      <p>300. He who sees hideous figures, and bright light without
        making out the flame, lives not for nine months. </p>
      <p>301. He who suddenly begins to feel heavy bodies light, and
        light bodies heavy, and he who being dark in color begins in
        disease to look gold-colored, must die! </p>
      <p>302. He whose hands, chest, and feet become at once dry after
        bathing has not ten nights to live. </p>
      <p>303. He who becomes dim of sight, and cannot see his face in
        the pupil of another’s eye must doubtless die. </p>
      <p>304. Now I shall tell thee something about the shady Figure [<i>Chya




          Purusha</i>]. Knowing this, man very soon becomes the knower
        of the three times. </p>
      <p>305. I shall speak of those experiments by means of which even
        distant death is known. I shall describe all these in accordance
        with the <i>Sivagama</i>. </p>
      <p>306. Going to a lonely place and standing with the back towards
        the sun let a man look with attention into the neck of the shade
        he throws on the ground. </p>
      <p>307. Let him see this for as long a time as he can calmly
        repeat the words: "<i>Om Kram parabrahman namah</i>" for 108
        times. Then let him look up into the sky. He will thus see <i>Shankara</i>
        [the figure of a being capable of appearing in many colors]. </p>
      <p>308. By doing this for six months, the <i>yogi</i> becomes the
        lord of those who walk on earth; by two years he becomes
        absolutely independent and his own master. </p>
      <p>309. He obtains the knowledge of the three times and great
        bliss. There is nothing impossible for the constant practice of
        <i>Yoga</i>. </p>
      <p>310. The <i>Yogi</i> who sees this figure in the clear heavens
        having a dark color, dies within six months. </p>
      <p>311. When it is yellow there is fear of disease; when it is red
        there will be loss; when it has many colors there will be great
        confusion and dejection. </p>
      <p>312. If the figure be wanting in feet, shanks, abdomen and the
        right arm, a relation is sure to die. </p>
      <p>313. If the left arm is wanting, the wife will die; when the
        chest and the right arm is wanting, death and destruction will
        come. </p>
      <p>314. When the feces and gas escape at once, the man is sure to
        die in ten days. </p>
      <p>315. When the moon flows altogether, and the sun is not seen at
        all, death comes surely within a month. </p>
      <p>316. Those whose death is near cease to see the <i>Arandhati</i>,
        the <i>Druhva</i>, the steps of <i>Vishnu</i>, and the circle
        of the mothers as they are pointed out to them. </p>
      <p>317. The <i>Arundhati</i> is the tongue; the <i>Dhruva</i>
        the tip of the nose; the eyebrows are the steps of <i>Vishnu</i>;
        the pupil of the eye is the circle of the mothers. </p>
      <p>318. The man who ceases to see the eyebrows dies within nine
        days; he who ceases to see the pupil of the eye dies within five
        days; he who ceases to see the nose dies within three days; he
        who ceases to see the tongue dies within one day. </p>
      <p>319. The pupil of the eye is seen by pressing the eye near the
        nose. </p>
      <p><b>The <i>Nadis</i> ~</b> </p>
      <p>320 The <i>Ida</i> is also technically called <i>Ganga</i>;
        the <i>Pingala</i>, <i>Yamuna</i>; the <i>Susumna, Saraswati</i>;
        the conjunction is called <i>Prayaga</i>. </p>
      <p>321. Let the <i>Yogi</i> sit in the posture called <i>padmasana</i>,
        and perform <i>pranayama</i>. </p>
      <p>322. The Yogi must know the <i>puraka</i>, the <i>rechaka</i>,
        and the third <i>Kumbhaka</i> for obtaining power over the
        body. </p>
      <p>323. The <i>puraka</i> causes growth and nourishment, and
        equalizes the humors; the <i>Kumbhaka</i> causes stability, and
        increases the security of life. </p>
      <p>324. The <i>Rechaka</i> takes away all the sins. He who
        practices this reaches the state of <i>yoga</i>. </p>
      <p>325. In the <i>Kumbhaka</i> hold the air in as much as
        possible; let it go out by the moon and in by the sun. </p>
      <p>326. The sun drinks the moon, the moon drinks the sun; by
        saturating one with the other, one may live till the moon and
        the planets. </p>
      <p>327. The <i>Nadi</i> flows in one’s own body. Have power over
        that; if it is not let go through the mouth or nose, one becomes
        a young man. </p>
      <p>328. When the mouth, nose, eyes and ears are stopped by the
        fingers, the <i>tatwas</i> begin to take their rise before the
        eyes. </p>
      <p>329. He who knows their color, their motion, their taste, their
        places, and their signs, becomes in this world equal to the god
        Rudra. </p>
      <p>330. He who knows all this, and reads it always, is freed from
        all pain and gets what he desires. </p>
      <p>331. He who has the knowledge of breath in his head, has
        fortune at his feet. </p>
      <p>332. Like the One in the <i>Vedas</i>, and the sun in the
        Universe, is the knower of the Science of Breath to be honored.
        He who knows the Science of Breath and the Philosophy of the <i>Tatwas</i>,
        knows not even millions of elixirs to be equal to it. </p>
      <p>333. There is nothing in the world that will release you of the
        debt of the man who gives you the knowledge of the word [<i>Om</i>]&nbsp;
and
of




        breath. </p>
      <p>334. Sitting in his own place, with measured food, and sleep,
        let the <i>Yogi</i> meditate upon the highest <i>Atma</i>
        [whose reflection the Breath is]. Whatever he says will come to
        pass. </p>
