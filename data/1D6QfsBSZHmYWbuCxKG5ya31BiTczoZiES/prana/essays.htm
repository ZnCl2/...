      <p>A word of explanation is necessary with regard to the book now
        offered to the public. In the 9th and 10th volumes of the
        theosophist I wrote certain Essays on "Nature’s Finer Forces".
        The subject of these essays interested the readers of the
        Theosophist so much that I was asked to issue the series of
        Essays in book form. I found that in order to make a book they
        must be almost entirely rearranged, and perhaps rewritten. I
        was, however, not equal to the task of rewriting what I had once
        written. I therefore determined to publish a translation of the
        book in Sanskrit on the <i>Science of the Breath and the
          Philosophy of the Tatwas</i>. As, however, without these
        Essays the book would have been quite unintelligible, I decided
        to add them to the book by way of an illustrative introduction.
        This accordingly has been done. The Essays in the theosophist
        have been reprinted with certain additions, modifications, and
        corrections. Besides, I have written seven more Essays in order
        to make the explanations more complete and authoritative. Thus
        there are altogether 15 introductory and explanatory Essays. </p>
      <p>I was confirmed in this course by one more consideration. The
        book contains a good deal more than the essays touched upon, and
        I thought it better to lay all of it before the public. </p>
      <p>The book is sure to throw a good deal of light upon the
        scientific researches of the ancient Aryans of India, and it
        will leave no doubt in a candid mind that the religion of
        ancient India had a scientific basis. It is chiefly for this
        reason that I have drawn my illustrations of the Tatwic Law from
        the Upanishads. </p>
      <p>There is a good deal in the book that can only be shown to be
        true by long and diligent experiment. Those who are devoted to
        the pursuit of truth without prejudice will no doubt be ready to
        wait before they form any opinion about such portions of the
        book. Others it is useless to reason with. </p>
      <p>To the former class of students I have to say one word more.
        From my own experience I can tell them that the more they study
        the book, the more wisdom they are sure to find in it, and let
        me hope that ere long I shall have a goodly number of
        colleagues, who will with me try their best to explain and
        illustrate the book still better, and more thoroughly. </p>

            Tatwas&nbsp; ~</font></b> </p>
      <p>The <i>tatwas</i> are the five modifications of the great
        Breath. Acting upon <i>prakriti,</i> this Great breath throws
        it into five states, having distinct vibratory motions, and
        performing different functions. The first outcome of the
        Evolutionary State of <i>parabrahma</i> is the <i>akasa tatwa</i>.
        After this come in order the <i>vayu</i>, the <i>taijas</i>,
        the <i>apas</i> and the <i>prithivi</i>. They are variously
        known as <i>mahabhutas</i>. The word <i>akasa</i> is generally
        translated into English by the word ether. Unfortunately,
        however,&nbsp; sound is not known to be the distinguishing
        quality of ether in modern English Science. Some few might also
        have the idea that the modern medium of light is the same as <i>akasa</i>.
        This, I believe, is a mistake. The luminiferous ether is the
        subtle <i>taijas tatwa</i>, and not the <i>akasa</i>. All the
        five subtle <i>tatwas</i> might no doubt be called ethers, but
        to use it for the word <i>akasa</i>, without any distinguishing
        epithet, is misleading. We might call <i>akasa</i> the
        sonoriferous ether, the <i>vayu</i> the tangiferous ether, <i>apas</i>
        the gustiferous ether, and <i>prithivi</i> the odoriferous
        ether. Just as there exists in the universe the luminiferous
        ether, an element of refined mater without which it has been
        found that the phenomena of light find no adequate explanation,
        so do there exist the four remaining ethers, elements of refined
        matter, without which it will be found that the phenomena of
        sound, touch, taste and smell find no adequate explanation. </p>
      <p>The luminiferous ether is supposed by Modern Science to be
        Matter in a most refined state. It is the vibrations of this
        element that are said to constitute light. The vibrations are
        said to take place at right angles to the direction of the wave.
        Nearly the same is the description of the <i>taijas tatwa</i>
        given in the book. It makes this <i>tatwa</i> move in an upward
        direction, and the center of the direction is, of course, the
        direction of the wave. Besides, it says that one whole vibration
        of this element makes the figure of a triangle. </p>
      <p>Suppose in the figure: </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="pras1a.jpg" height="175" width="119"></p>
      </center>
      <p>AB is the direction of the wave; BC is the direction of the
        vibration. CA is the line along which, seeing that in expansion
        the symmetrical arrangements of the atoms of a body are not
        changed, the vibrating atom must return to its symmetrical
        position in the line AB. </p>
      <p>The <i>taijas tatwa</i> of the Ancients is then exactly the
        luminiferous ether of the Moderns, so far as the nature of the
        vibration is concerned. There is no exception, however, of the
        four remaining ethers, at all events in a direct manner, in
        Modern Science. The vibrations of <i>akasa</i>, the soniferous
        ether, constitute sound; and it is quite necessary to recognize
        the distinctive character of this form of motion. </p>
      <p>The experiment of the bell in a vacuum goes to prove that the
        vibrations of atmosphere propagate sound. Any other media,
        however, such as the earth and the metals, are known to transmit
        sound in various degrees. There must, therefore, be some one
        thing in all these media which gives birth to sound -- the
        vibration that constitutes sound. That something is the Indian <i>akasa</i>.
      </p>
      <p>But <i>akasa</i> is all-pervading, just as the luminiferous
        ether. Why, then, is not sound transmitted to our ears when a
        vacuum is produced in the bell-jar? The real fact is that we
        must make a difference between the vibrations of the elements
        that constitute sound and light, etc., and the vibrations in the
        media which transmit these impressions to our senses. It is not
        the vibrations of the ethers -- the subtle <i>tatwas</i> --
        that cause our perceptions, but the ethereal vibrations
        transferred to different media, which are so many modifications
        of gross matter -- the <i>sthula Mahabhutas</i>. The
        luminiferous ether is present just as much in a darkened room as
        in the space without. The minutest space within the dimensions
        of the surrounding walls themselves is not void of it. For all
        this the luminosity of the exterior is not present in the
        interior. Why? The reason is that our ordinary vision does not
        see the vibrations of the luminiferous ether. It only sees the
        vibrations of the media that the ether pervades. The capability
        of being set into ethereal vibrations varies with different
        media. In the space without the darkened room the ether brings
        the atoms of the atmosphere into the necessary state of visual
        vibration, and one wide expanse of light is presented to our
        view. The same is the case with every other object that we see.
        The ether that pervades the object brings the atoms of that
        object into the necessary state of visual vibration. The
        strength of the ethereal vibrations that the presence of the sun
        imparts to the ether pervading our planet is not sufficient to
        evoke the same state in the dead matter of the darkening walls.
        The internal ether, divided from the eternal one by this dead
        mass, is itself cut off from such vibrations. The darkness of
        the room is thus the consequence, notwithstanding the presence
        therein of the luminiferous ether. An electric spark in the
        vacuum of a bell-jar must needs be transmitted to our eyes,
        because the glass of the jar which stands in contact with the
        internal luminiferous ether has a good deal of the quality of
        being put into the state of visual vibration, which from thence
        is transmitted to the external ether and thence to the eye. The
        same would never be the case if we were to use a porcelain or an
        earthen jar. It is this capability of being put into the state
        of visual vibrations that we call transparency in glass and
        similar objects. </p>
      <p>To return to the soniferous ether (<i>akasa</i>): Every form of
        gross matter has, to a certain extent, which varies with various
        forms, what we may call auditory transparency. </p>
      <p>Now I have to say something about the nature of the vibrations.
        Two things must be understood in this connection. In the first
        place the external form of the vibration is something like the
        hole of the ear: </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="pras1b.jpg" height="95" width="93"></p>
      </center>
      <p>It throws matter which is subject to it, into the form of a
        dotted sheet: </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="pras1c.jpg" height="97" width="91"></p>
      </center>
      <p>These dots are little points, rising above the common surface
        so as to produce microscopic pits in the sheet. It is said to
        move by fits and starts (<i>sankrama</i>), and to move in all
        directions (<i>sarvatogame</i>). It means to say that the
        impulse falls back upon itself along the line of its former
        path, which lies on all sides of the direction of the wave: </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="pras1d.jpg" height="105" width="106"></p>
      </center>
      <p>It will be understood that these ethers produce in gross media
        vibrations similar to their own. The form, therefore, into which
        the auditory vibrations throw the atmospheric air is a true clue
        to the form of the ethereal vibration. And the vibrations of
        atmospheric air discovered by Modern Science are similar. </p>
      <p>Now we come to the tangiferous ether (<i>vayu</i>). The
        vibrations of this ether are described as being spherical in
        form, and the motion is said to be at acute angles to the wave (<i>tiryak</i>).



        Such is the representation of these vibrations on the plane of
        the paper: </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="pras1e.jpg" height="108" width="111"></p>
      </center>
      <p>The remarks about the transmission of sound in the case of <i>akasa</i>
        apply here too, <i>mutatis mutandis</i>. The gustiferous ether
        (<i>apas tatwa</i>) is said to resemble in shape the half moon.
        It is, moreover, said to move downward. This direction is
        opposite to that of the luminiferous ether. This force therefore
        causes contraction. Here is the representation of the apas
        vibrations on the plane of paper: </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="pras1f.jpg" height="61" width="250"></p>
      </center>
      <p>The process of contraction will be considered when I come to
        the qualities of the <i>tatwas</i>. </p>
      <p>The odoriferous ether (<i>prithivi</i>) is said to be
        quadrangular in shape, thus: </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="pras1g.jpg" height="92" width="153"></p>
      </center>
      <p>This is said to move in the middle. It neither moves at right
        angles, nor at acute angles, nor upwards, nor downwards, but it
        moves along the line of the wave. The line and the quadrangle
        are in the same plane. </p>
      <p>These are the forms, and the modes of motion, of the five
        ethers. </p>
      <p>Of the five sensations of men, each of these gives birth to
        one, thus: </p>
      <p>(1)&nbsp; <i>Akasa</i>, Sonorifierous ether, Sound; (2)&nbsp;
        <i>Vayu</i>, Tangiferous ether, Touch; (3)&nbsp; <i>Taijas</i>,
        Luminfierous ether, Color; (4) <i>Apas</i>, Gustiferous ether,
        Taste; (5) <i>Prithivi</i>, Odoriferous ether, Smell. </p>
      <p>In the process of evolution, these co-existing ethers, while
        retaining their general, relative forms and primary qualities,
        contract the qualities of the other <i>tatwas</i>. This is
        known as the process of <i>panchikarana</i>, or division into
        five. </p>
      <p>If we take, as our book does, H, P, R, V and L to be the
        algebraic symbols for (1), (2), (3), (4), and (5), respectively,
        after <i>panchikarana</i>&nbsp; the ethers assume the following
        forms: </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="prasx.jpg" height="355" width="227"></p>
      </center>
      <p>One molecule of each ether, consisting of eight atoms, has four
        of the original principle ethers, and one of the remaining four.
      </p>
      <p>The following table will show the five qualities of each of the
        <i>tatwas</i> after <i>panchikarana</i>: </p>

      <p>It might be remarked here that the subtle <i>tatwas</i> exist
        now in the universe on four planes. The higher of these planes
        differ from the lower in having a greater number of vibrations
        per second. The four planes are: </p>
      <p>(1) Physical (<i>Prana</i>); (2) Mental (<i>Manas</i>); (3)
        Psychic (<i>Vijnana</i>); (4) Spiritual (<i>Ananda</i>) </p>
      <p>I shall discuss, however, some of the secondary qualities of
        these <i>tatwas</i>. </p>
      <p>(1) Space ~ This is a quality of the <i>akasa tatwa</i>. It
        has been asserted that the vibration of this ether is shaped
        like the hole of the ear, and that in the body thereof are
        microscopic points (<i>vindus</i>). It follows evidently that
        the interstices between the points serve to give space to
        ethereal minima, and offer them room for locomotion (<i>avakasa</i>).


      </p>
      <p>(2) Locomotion ~ This is the quality of the <i>vayu tatwa</i>.
        <i>Vayu</i> is a form of motion itself, for motion in all
        directions is motion in a circle, large or small. The <i>vayu
          tatwa</i> itself has the form of spherical motion. When to the
        motion which keeps the form of the different ethers is added to
        the stereotyped motion of the <i>vayu</i>, locomotion is the
        result. </p>
      <p>(3) Expansion ~ This is the quality of the <i>taijas tatwa</i>.
        This follows evidently from the shape and form of motion which
        is given to this ethereal vibration. Suppose ABC is a lump of
        metal: </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="pras1h.jpg" height="149" width="154"></p>
      </center>
      <p>If we apply fire to it, the luminiferous ether in it is set in
        motion, and that drives the gross atoms of the lump into similar
        motion. Suppose (a) is an atom. This being impelled to assume
        the shape of the <i>taijas</i>, vibration goes towards (a’),
        and then takes the symmetrical position of (a'). Similarly does
        every point change its place round the center of the piece of
        metal. Ultimately the whole piece assumes the shape of A’B’C’.
        Expansion is thus the result. </p>
      <p>(4) Contraction ~ This is the quality of the <i>apas tatwa</i>.
        As has been remarked before, the direction of this ether is the
        reverse of the <i>agni</i>, and it is therefore easy to
        understand that contraction is the result of the play of this <i>tatwa</i>.
      </p>
      <p>(5) Cohesion ~ This is the quality of the <i>prithivi tatwa</i>.
        It will be seen that this is the reverse of <i>akasa</i>. <i>Akasa</i>
        gives room for locomotion, while <i>prithivi</i> resists it.
        This is the natural result of the direction and shape of this
        vibration. It covers up the spaces of the <i>akasa</i>. </p>
      <p>(6) Smoothness ~ This is a quality of the <i>apas tatwa</i>.
        As the atoms of any body in contraction come near each other and
        assume the semi-lunar shape of the apas, they must easily glide
        over each other. The very shape secures easy motion for the
        atoms. </p>
      <p>This, I believe, is sufficient to explain the general nature of
        the <i>tatwas</i>. The different phases of their manifestation
        on all the planes of life will be taken up in their proper
        places. </p>
      <p><a name="ii"></a><b><font size="+1">II.&nbsp;&nbsp; Evolution ~</font></b>
      </p>
      <p>It will be very interesting to trace the development of man and
        the development of the world according to the theory of the <i>tatwas</i>.
      </p>
      <p>The <i>tatwas</i>, as we have already seen, are the
        modifications of <i>Swara</i>. Regarding <i>Swara</i>, we find
        in our book: "In the <i>Swara</i> are the <i>Vedas</i> and the
        <i>shastras</i>, and in the <i>Swara</i> is music. All the
        world is in the <i>Swara</i>; <i>Swara</i> is the spirit
        itself." The proper translation of the word <i>Swara</i> is
        "the current of the life-wave". It is that wavy motion which is
        the cause of the evolution of cosmic undifferentiated matter
        into the differentiated universe, and the involution of this
        into the primary state of non-differentiation, and so on, in and
        out, forever and ever. From whence does this motion come? This
        motion is the spirit itself. The word <i>atma</i> used in the
        book, itself carries the idea of eternal motion, coming as it
        does from the root at, eternal motion; and it may be
        significantly remarked, that the root <i>at</i> is connected
        with (and in fact is simply another form of) the roots <i>ah</i>,
        breath, and <i>as</i>, being. All these roots have for their
        original the sound produced by the breathing of animals. In <i>The



          Science of Breath</i> the symbol for inspiration is <i>sa</i>,
        and for expiration <i>ha</i>. It is easy to see how these
        symbols are connected with the roots <i>as</i> and <i>ah</i>.
        The current of life-wave spoken of above is technically called <i>Hansachasa</i>,
        i.e., the motion of <i>ha</i> and <i>sa</i>. The word <i>Hansa</i>,
        which is taken to mean God, and is made so much of in many
        Sanskrit works, is only the symbolic representation of the
        eternal processes of life -- <i>ha</i> and <i>sa</i>. </p>
      <p>The primeval current of life-wave is, then, the same which in
        man assumes the form of inspiratory and expiratory motion of the
        lungs, and this is the all-pervading source of the evolution and
        the involution of the universe. </p>
      <p>The book goes on: "It is the <i>Swara</i> that has given form
        to the first accumulations of the divisions of the universe; the
        <i>Swara</i> causes involution and evolution; the <i>Swara</i>
        is God Himself, or more properly the great Power (<i>Mahashwara</i>)."



        The <i>Swara</i> is the manifestation of the impression on
        matter of that power which in man is known to us as the power
        that knows itself. It is to be understood that the action of
        this power never ceases. It is ever at work, and evolution and
        involution are the very necessity of its unchangeable existence.
      </p>
      <p>The <i>Swara</i> has two different states. The one is known on
        the physical plane as the sun-breath, the other as the
        moon-breath. I shall, however, at the present stage of evolution
        designate them as positive and negative respectively. The period
        during which this current comes back to the point from whence it
        started is known as the night of <i>parabrahma</i>. The
        positive or evolutionary period is known as the day of <i>parabrahma</i>;
        the negative or involutionary portion is known as the night of <i>parabrahma</i>.
        These nights and days follow each other without break. The
        sub-divisions of this period comprehend all the phases of
        existence, and it is therefore necessary to give her the scale
        of time according to the Hindu <i>Shastras</i>. </p>
      <p><b>The Divisions of Time ~</b> </p>
      <p>I shall begin with a <i>Truti</i> as the least division of
        time. <br>
        26-2/3 <i>truti</i> = 1 <i>nimesha</i> = 8/45 second. <br>
        18 <i>nimesha</i> = 1 <i>kashtha</i> = 3-1/5 seconds = 8 <i>vipala</i>.
        <br>
        30 <i>kashtha</i> = 1 <i>kala</i> = 1-3/5 minutes = 4 <i>pala</i>.
        <br>
        30 <i>kala</i> = 1 <i>mahurta</i> = 48 minutes = 2 <i>ghari</i>.
        <br>
        30 <i>mahurta </i>= 1 day and night = 24 hours = 60 <i>ghari</i>.
        <br>
        30 days and nights&nbsp; and odd hours = 1 <i>Pitruja</i> day
        and night = 1 month and odd hours. <br>
        12 months = 1 <i>Daiva</i> day and night = 1 year = 365 days,
        15", 30', 31”. <br>
        365 <i>Daiva</i> days and nights = 1 <i>Daiva</i> year. <br>
        4,800 <i>Daiva</i> years = 1 <i>Satya yuga</i>. <br>
        3,600 <i>Daiva</i> years = 1 <i>Treta yuga</i>. <br>
        2,400 <i>Daiva</i> years = 1 <i>Dwapara yuga</i>. <br>
        1,200 <i>Daiva</i> years = 1 <i>Kali yuga</i>. <br>
        12,000 <i>Daiva</i> years = 1 <i>Chaturyugi</i> (four <i>yuga</i>).




        <br>
        12,000 <i>Chaturyugi</i> = 1 <i>Daiva yuga</i>. <br>
        2,000 <i>Daiva yuga</i> = 1 day and night of <i>Brahma</i>. <br>
        365 Brahmic days and nights = 1 year of <i>Brahma</i>. <br>
        71 <i>Daiva yuga</i> = 1 <i>Manwantara</i>. <br>
        12,000 Brahmic years = 1 <i>Chaturyuga</i> of Brahma, and so
        one. <br>
        200 <i>yuga</i> of <i>Brahma</i> = 1 day and night of <i>parabrahma</i>.
      </p>
      <p>These days and nights follow each other in eternal succession,
        and hence eternal evolution and involution. </p>
      <p>We have thus five sets of days and night: (1) <i>Parabrahma</i>,
        (2) <i>Brahma</i>, (3) <i>Daiva</i>, (4) <i>Pitrya</i>, (5) <i>Manusha</i>.
        A sixth is the <i>Manwantara</i> day, and the <i>Manwantara</i>
        night (<i>pralaya</i>). </p>
      <p>The days and nights of <i>parabrahma</i> follow each other
        without beginning or end. The night (the negative period and the
        day (the positive period) both merge into the <i>susumna</i>
        (the conjunctive period) and merge into each other. And so do
        the other days and nights. The days all through this division
        are sacred to the positive, the hotter current, and the nights
        are sacred to the negative, the cooler current. The impressions
        of names and forms, and the power of producing an impression,
        lie in the positive phase of existence. Receptivity is given
        birth to by the negative current. </p>
      <p>After being subjected to the negative phase of <i>parabrahma</i>,
        <i>Prakriti</i>, which follows <i>parabrahma</i> like a shadow,
        has been saturated with evolutionary receptivity; as the hotter
        current sets in, changes are imprinted upon it, and it appears
        in changed forms. The first imprint that the evolutionary
        positive current leaves upon <i>Prakriti</i> is known as <i>akasa</i>.
        Then, by and by the remaining ethers come into existence. These
        modifications of <i>Prakriti</i> are the ethers of the first
        stage. </p>
      <p>Into these five ethers, as now constituting the objective
        phase, works on the current of the Great Breath. A further
        development takes place. Different centers come into existence.
        The <i>akasa</i> throws them into a form that gives room for
        locomotion. With the beginning of the <i>vayu tatwa</i> these
        elementary ethers are thrown into the form of spheres. This was
        the beginning of formation, or what may also be called
        solidification. </p>
      <p>These spheres are our <i>Brahmandas</i>. In them the ethers
        assume a secondary development. The so-called division into five
        takes place. In this Brahmic sphere in which the new ethers have
        good room for locomotion, the <i>taijas tatwa</i> now comes
        into play, and then the <i>apas tatwa</i>. Every tatwic quality
        is generated into, and preserved in, these spheres by these
        currents. In process of time we have a center and an atmosphere.
        This sphere is the self-conscious universe. </p>
      <p>In this sphere, according to the same process, a third ethereal
        state comes into existence. In the cooler atmosphere removed
        from the center another class of centers comes into existence.
        These divide the Brahmic state of matter into two different
        states. After this comes into existence another state of matter
        whose centers bear the names of <i>devas</i> or suns. </p>
      <p>We have thus four states of subtle matter in the universe: </p>
      <p>(1) <i>Prana</i>, life matter, with the sun for center; (2) <i>Manas</i>,
        mental matter, with the <i>manu</i> for center; (3) <i>Vijnana</i>,
        psychic matter, with <i>Brahma</i> for center; (4) <i>Ananda</i>,
        spiritual matter, with <i>parabrahma</i> as the infinite
        substratum. </p>
      <p>Every higher state is positive with regard to the lower one,
        and every lower on is given birth to by a combination of the
        positive and negative phase of the higher. </p>
      <p>(1) <i>Prana</i> has to do with three sets of days and nights
        in the above division of time: (a) Our ordinary days and nights;
        (b) The bright and dark half of the month which are called the
        pitrya day and night; (c) The northern and southern halves of
        the years, the day and night of the <i>devas</i>. </p>
      <p>These three nights acting upon earth-matter impart to it the
        receptivity of the cool, negative shady phase of life-matter.
        These nights imprint themselves on the respective days coming in
        after it. The earth herself thus becomes a living being, having
        a north pole, in which a central force draws the needle towards
        itself, and a south pole in which is centered a for which is, so
        to speak, the shade of the north polar center. It has also
        always a solar force centered in the eastern half, and the lunar
        -- the shade of the former -- centered in the western half. </p>
      <p>These centers come, in fact, into existence even before the
        earth is manifested on the gross plane. So too do the centers of
        other planets come into existence. As the sun presents himself
        to the manu there come into existence two states of matter in
        which the sun lives and moves -- the positive and the negative.
        As the solar <i>prana</i>, after having been for some time
        subjected to the negative shady state, is subjected in its
        revolutionary course to the source of its positive phase, <i>man</i>u,
the




        figure of <i>man</i>u is imprinted upon it. This <i>manu</i>
        is, in fact, the universal mind, and all the planets with their
        inhabitants are the phases of his existence. Of this, however,
        more heareafter. At present we see that earth-life or
        Terrestrial <i>Prana</i> has four centers of force. </p>
      <p>When it has been cooled by the negative current, the positive
        phase imprints itself upon it, and earth-life in various forms
        comes into existence. The essays on <i>prana</i> will explain
        this more clearly. </p>
      <p>(2) <i>Manas</i>: this has to do with <i>manu</i>. The suns
        revolve round these centers with the whole of their atmospheres
        of <i>prana</i>. This system gives birth to the <i>lokas</i>
        or spheres of life, of which the planets are one class. </p>
      <p>These <i>lokas</i> have been enumerated by Vyasa in his
        commentary on the <i>Yogasutra</i> (III. <i>Pada</i>, 26th <i>Sutra</i>).




        The aphorism runs thus: </p>
      <p>"By meditation upon the sun is obtained a knowledge of the
        physical creation." </p>
      <p>On this, the revered commentator says: "There are seven <i>lokas</i>
        (spheres of existence)." </p>
      <p>(1) The <i>Bhurloka</i>: this extends to the Meru; (2) <i>Antareikshaloka</i>:
        this extends from the surface of the <i>Meru</i> to the <i>Dhru</i>,
        the pole-star, and contains the planets, the <i>nakstatras</i>,
        and the stars; (3) Beyond that is the <i>swarloka</i>: this is
        fivefold and sacred to Mahendra; (4) <i>Maharloka</i>: This is
        sacred to the Prajapati; (5) <i>Janaloka</i>; (6) <i>Tapas
          loka</i>, and; (7) <i>Satya loka</i>. These three (5, 6, and
        7) are sacred to <i>Brahma</i>. </p>
      <p>It is not my purpose to try at present to explain the meaning
        of these <i>lokas</i>. It is sufficient for my present purpose
        to say that the planets, the stars, the lunar mansions are all
        impressions of <i>manu</i>, just as the organisms of the earth
        are the impressions of the sun. The solar <i>prana</i> is
        prepared for this impression during the <i>manwantara</i>
        night. </p>
      <p>Similarly, <i>Vijnana</i> has to do with the nights and days
        of <i>Brahma</i>, and <i>Ananda</i> with those of <i>Parabrahma</i>.
      </p>
      <p>It will thus be seen that the whole process of creation, on
        whatever plane of life, is performed most naturally by the five
        <i>tatwas</i> in their double modifications, the positive and
        negative. There is nothing in the universe that the Universal
        Tatwic Law of Breath does not comprehend. </p>
      <p>After this brief exposition of the theory of tatwic evolution
        comes a series of Essays, taking up all the subtle states of
        matter one by one, and describing more in detail the working of
        the tatwic law in those planes, and also the manifestations of
        these planes of life in humanity. </p>
      <p><a name="iii"></a><b><font size="+1">III.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
            Mutual Relation of the Tatwas and of the Principles ~</font></b>
      </p>
      <p>The <i>akasa</i> is the most important of all the <i>tatwas</i>.
        It must, as a matter of course, precede and follow every change
        of state on every plane of life. Without this there can be no
        manifestation or cessation of forms. It is out of <i>akasa</i>
        that every form comes, and it is in <i>akasa</i> that every
        form lives. The <i>akasa</i> is full of forms in their
        potential state. It intervenes between every two of the five <i>tatwas</i>,
        and between every two of the five principles. </p>
      <p>The evolution of the <i>tatwas</i> is always part of the
        evolution of a certain definite form. Thus the manifestation of
        the primary <i>tatwas</i> is with the definite aim of giving
        what we may call a body, a Prakritic form to the <i>Iswara</i>.
        In the bosom of the Infinite <i>Parabrahma</i>, there are
        hidden unnumerable such centers. One center takes under its
        influence a certain portion of the Infinite, and there we find
        first of all coming into existence the <i>akasa tatwa</i>. The
        extent of this <i>akasa</i> limits the extent of the Universe,
        and out of it the <i>Iswara</i> is to come. With this end comes
        out of this <i>akasa</i> the <i>Vayu tatwa</i>. This pervades
        the whole Universe and has a certain center that serves to keep
        the whole expanse together, and separate as one whole, from
        other universes (<i>Brahmandas</i>). </p>
      <p>It has been mentioned, and further on will be more clearly
        explained, that every <i>tatwa</i> has a positive and a
        negative phase. It is also evident on the analogy of the sun
        that places more distant from the center are always negative to
        those which are nearer. We might say that they are cooler than
        these, as it will be seen later on the heat is not peculiar to
        the sun only, but that all the higher centers have a greater
        amount of heat than even the sun itself. </p>
      <p>Well then, in this Brahmic sphere of <i>Vayu</i>, except for
        some space near the <i>parabrahmic akasa</i>, every atom of the
        <i>vayu</i> is reacted upon by an opposite force. The more
        distant and therefore the cooler one reacts upon the nearer and
        therefore the hotter. The equal and opposite vibrations of the
        same force cancel each other, and both together pass into the
        akasic state. Thus, while some of this space remains filled up
        by the Brahmic <i>Vayu</i> on account of the constant outflow
        of this <i>tatwa</i> from the parabrahmic <i>akasa</i>, the
        remainder is rapidly turned into <i>akasa</i>. This <i>akasa</i>
        is the mother of the Brahmic <i>agni tatwa</i>. The <i>agni
          tatwa</i> working similarly gives birth through another <i>akasa</i>
        to the <i>apas</i>, and this similarly to the <i>prithivi</i>.
        This Brahmic <i>prithivi</i> thus contains the qualities of all
        the preceding <i>tatwas</i> besides a fifth one of its own. </p>
      <p>The first stage of the Universe, the ocean of psychic matter
        has now come into existence in its entirety. This matter is, of
        course, very, very fine, and there is absolutely no grossness in
        it as compared with the matter of the fifth plane. In this ocean
        shines the intelligence of <i>Iswara</i>, and this ocean, with
        everything that might be manifest in it, is the self-conscious
        universe. </p>
      <p>In this psychic ocean, as before, the more distant atoms are
        negative to the nearer ones. Hence, except a certain space which
        remains filled with the psychic <i>prithivi</i> on account of
        the constant supply of this element from above, the rest begins
        to change into an <i>akasa</i>. This second <i>akasa</i> is
        full of what are called <i>Manus</i> in their potential state.
        The <i>Manus</i> are so many groups of certain mental forms,
        the ideals of the various genera and species of life to appear
        further on. We have to do with one of these. </p>
      <p>Impelled by the evolutionary current of the Great Breath, <i>manu</i>
        comes out of this <i>akasa</i>, in the same way as <i>Brahma</i>
        did out of the parabrahmic <i>akasa</i>. First and uppermost in
        the mental sphere is the <i>Vayu</i>, and then in regular order
        the <i>taijas</i>, the <i>apas</i>, and the <i>prithivi</i>.
        This mental matter follows the same laws, and similarly begins
        to pass into the third akasic state, which is full of
        innumerable suns. They come out in the same way, and begin to
        work on a similar plan, which will be better understood here
        than higher up. </p>
      <p>Everybody can test here for himself that the more distant
        portions of the solar system are cooler than the nearer ones.
        Every little atom of <i>Prana</i> is comparatively cooler than
        the adjacent one towards the sun from itself. Hence equal and
        opposite vibrations cancel each other. Leaving, therefore, a
        certain space near the sun as always filled up with the <i>tatwas</i>
        of <i>Prana</i>, which are there being constantly supplied from
        the sun, the rest of the <i>Prana</i> passes into the akasic
        state. </p>
      <p>It might be noted down here that the whole of this <i>Prana</i>
        is made up of innumerable little points.&nbsp; In the future I
        shall speak of these points of as <i>trutis</i>, and might say
        here that it is these <i>trutis</i> that appear on the
        terrestrial plane as atoms (<i>anu</i> or <i>paramanu</i>).
        They might be spoken of as solar atoms. These solar atoms are of
        various classes according to the prevalence of one or more of
        the constituent <i>tatwas</i>. </p>
      <p>Every point of <i>Prana</i> is a perfect picture of the whole
        ocean. Every other point is represented in every point. Every
        atom has, therefore, for its constituents, all the four <i>tatwas</i>,
        in varying proportions according to its position in respect of
        others. The different classes of these solar atoms appear on the
        terrestrial plane as the various elements of chemistry. </p>
      <p>The spectrum of every terrestrial element reveals the color or
        colors of the prevalent <i>tatwa</i> or <i>tatwas</i> of a
        solar atom of that substance. The greater the heat to which any
        substance is subjected the nearer does the element approaches
        its solar state. Heat destroys for the time being the
        terrestrial coatings of the solar atoms. </p>
      <p>The spectrum of sodium thus shows the presence of the yellow <i>prithivi</i>,
        that of lithium, the red <i>agni</i> and the yellow <i>prithivi</i>,
        that of cesium, the red <i>agni</i>, the green admixture, the
        yellow <i>prithivi</i>, and the blue <i>vayu</i>. Rubidium
        shows red, orange, yellow, green and blue, i.e., the <i>agni</i>,
        <i>prithivi</i> and <i>agni</i>, <i>prithivi</i>, <i>vayu</i>
        and <i>prithivi</i>, and <i>vayu</i>. These classes of solar
        atoms that make up all put altogether, the wide expanse of the
        solar <i>prana</i>, pass into the akasic state. While the sun
        keeps up a constant supply of these atoms, those that are
        passing into the akasic state pass on the other side into the
        planetary <i>vayu</i>. Certain measured portions of the solar <i>akasa</i>
        naturally separate themselves from others, according to the
        differing creation that is to appear in those portions. These
        portions of <i>akasa</i> are called lokas. The earth itself is
        a <i>loka</i> called the <i>Bhurloka</i>. I shall take up the
        earth for further illustration of the law. </p>
      <p>That portion of the solar <i>akasa</i> that is the immediate
        mother of the Earth, first gives birth to the terrestrial <i>Vayu</i>.
        Every element is now in the state of the <i>Vayu tatwa</i>,
        which may now be called gaseous. The <i>Vayu tatwa</i> is
        spherical in shape, and thus the gaseous planet bears similar
        outlines. The center of this gaseous sphere keeps together round
        itself the whole expanse of gas. As soon as this gaseous sphere
        comes into existence, it is subjected to the following
        influences among others: </p>
      <p>(1) The superposed influence of the solar heat; (2) The
        internal influence of the more distant atoms on the nearer ones
        and <i>vice versa</i>. </p>
      <p>The first influence has a double effect upon the gaseous
        sphere. It imparts more heat to the nearer hemisphere than to
        the more distant one. The superficial air of the nearer
        hemisphere having contracted a certain amount of solar energy,
        rises towards the sun. Cooler air from below takes its place.
        But where does the superficial air go? It cannot pass beyond the
        limit of the terrestrial sphere, which is surrounded by the
        solar <i>akasa</i> through which comes a supply from the solar
        <i>Prana</i>. It therefore begins to move in a circle, and thus
        a rotary motion is established in the sphere. This is the origin
        of the earth’s rotation upon its axis. </p>
      <p>Again, as a certain amount of the solar energy is imparted to
        the gaseous terrestrial sphere, the impulse of the upward motion
        reaches the center itself. Therefore that center itself, and
        along with it the whole sphere, moves towards the sun. It
        cannot, however, go on in this direction, for a nearer approach
        would destroy that balance of forces that gives the earth its
        peculiarities. A <i>loka</i> that is nearer to the sun than our
        planet cannot have the same conditions of life. Hence, while the
        sun draws the earth towards itself, those laws of life that have
        given it a constitution, on which ages must roll on, keep it in
        the sphere they have assigned to it. Two forces thus come into
        existence. Drawn by one the earth would go towards the sun;
        checked by the other it must remain where it is. These are the
        centrifugal and the centripetal forces, and their action results
        in giving the earth its annual revolution. </p>
      <p>Secondly, the internal action of the gaseous atoms upon each
        other ends in the change of the whole gaseous sphere, except the
        upper portion, into the akasic state. This akasic state gives
        birth to the igneous (pertaining to the <i>agni tatwa</i>)
        state of terrestrial matter. This changes similarly into the <i>apas</i>,
        and this again into the <i>prithivi</i>. </p>
      <p>The same process obtains in the changes of matter with which we
        are now familiar. An example will better illustrate the whole
        law. </p>
      <p>Take ice. This is solid, or what the Science of Breath would
        call in the state of <i>prithivi</i>. One quality of the <i>prithivi




          tatwa</i>, the reader will remember, is cohesive resistance.
        Let us apply heat to this ice. As this heat passes into the ice,
        it is indicated by the thermometer. When the temperature rises
        to 78 degrees, the ice changes its state. But the thermometer no
        longer indicates the same amount of heat. 78 degrees of heat
        have become latent. </p>
      <p>Let us now apply 536 degrees of heat to a pound of boiling
        water. As is generally known, this great quantity of heat
        becomes latent while the water passes into the gaseous state. </p>
      <p>Now let us follow the reverse process. To gaseous water let us
        apply a certain amount of cold. When this cold becomes
        sufficient entirely to counteract the heat that keeps it in the
        gaseous state, the vapor passes into the <i>akasa</i> state,
        and from thence into the <i>taijas</i> state. It is not
        necessary that the whole of the vapor should at once pass into
        the next state. The change is gradual. As the cold is gradually
        passing into the vapor, the <i>taijas</i> modification is
        gradually appearing out of, and through the intervention of <i>akasa</i>,
        into which it had passed during latency. This is being indicated
        on the thermometer. When the whole has passed into the igneous
        state, and the thermometer has indicated 536 degrees, the second
        <i>akasa</i> comes into existence. Out of this second <i>akasa</i>
        comes the liquid state at the same temperature, the whole heat
        having again passed into the <i>akasa</i> state, and therefore
        no longer indicated by the thermometer. </p>
      <p>When cold is applied to this liquid, heat again begins to come
        out, and when it reaches 78 degrees, this heat having come out
        of and through the <i>akasa</i>, into which it had passed, the
        whole liquid had passed into the igneous state. Here it again
        begins to pass into the <i>akasa</i> state. The thermometer
        begins to fall down, and out of this <i>akasa</i> begins to
        come the <i>prithivi</i> state of water --- ice. </p>
      <p>Thus we see that the heat which is given out by the influence
        of cold passes into the <i>akasa</i> state, which becomes the
        substratum of a higher phase, and the heat which is absorbed
        passes into another <i>akasa</i> state, which becomes the
        substratum of a lower phase. </p>
      <p>It is in this way that the terrestrial gaseous sphere changes
        into its present state. The experiment described above points
        out many important truths about the relation of these <i>tatwas</i>
        to each other. </p>
      <p>First of all it explains that very important assertion of the
        Science of Breath which says that every succeeding tatwic state
        has the qualities of all the foregoing tatwic states. Thus we
        see that as the gaseous state of water is being acted upon by
        cold, the latent heat of steam is being cancelled and passing
        into the <i>akasa</i> state. This cannot but be the case, since
        equal and opposite vibrations of the same force always cancel
        each other, and the result is the <i>akasa</i>. Out of this
        comes the <i>taijas</i> state of matter. This is that state in
        which the latent heat of steam becomes patent. It will be
        observed that this state has no permanence. The <i>taijas</i>
        form of water, as indeed any other substance, cannot exist for
        any length of time, because the major part of terrestrial matter
        is in the lower and therefore more negative states of <i>apas</i>
        and <i>prithivi</i>, and whenever for any cause any substance
        passes into the <i>taijas</i> state, the surrounding objects
        begin at once to react upon it with such force as at once to
        force it into the next <i>akasa</i> state. Those things that
        now live in the normal state of the <i>apas</i> or the <i>prithivi</i>
        find it quite against the laws of their existence to remain,
        except under external influence, in the <i>taijas</i> (igneous)
        state. Thus an atom of gaseous water before passing into the
        liquid state has already remained in the three states, the <i>akasa</i>,
        the gaseous, and the <i>taijas</i>. It must, therefore, have
        all the qualities of the three <i>tatwas</i>, and so it no
        doubt has. Cohesive resistance is only wanted, and that is the
        quality of the <i>prithivi tatwa</i>. </p>
      <p>Now when this atom of liquid water passes into the icy state,
        what do we see? All the states that have preceded must again
        show themselves. Cold will cancel the latent heat of the liquid
        state, and the <i>akasa</i> state will come out. Out of this <i>akasa</i>
        state is sure to come the gaseous state. This gaseous (<i>Vayava</i>)
        state is evidenced by the gyrations and other motions that are
        set up in the body of the liquid by the mere application of the
        cold. The motion, however, is not of very long duration, and as
        they are ceasing (passing into the <i>akasa</i> state) the <i>taijas</i>
        state is coming out. This too, however, is not of long duration,
        and as this is passing into the <i>akasa</i> state, the ice is
        coming into existence. </p>
      <p>It will be easy to see that all four states of terrestrial
        matter exist in our sphere. The gaseous (<i>Vayava</i>) is there
        in what we call the atmosphere; the igneous (<i>taijas</i>) is
        the normal temperature of earth life; the liquid (<i>apas</i>)
        is the ocean; the solid (<i>prithivi</i>) is the <i>terra firma</i>.
        None of these states, however, exists quite isolated from the
        other. Each is constantly invading the domain of the other, and
        thus it is difficult to find any portion of space filled up only
        with matter in one state. The two adjacent tatwas are found
        intermixed with each other to a greater degree than those that
        are removed from each other by an intermediate state. Thus <i>prithivi</i>
        will be found mixed up to a greater extent with water than with
        <i>agni</i> and <i>vayu</i>, <i>apas</i> with <i>agni</i>
        than with <i>vayu</i>, and <i>vayu</i> with <i>agni</i> more
        than with any other. It would thus appear from the above,
        according to the science of <i>tatwas</i>, that the flame and
        other luminous bodies on earth are not in the terrestrial <i>taijas</i>
        (igneous) state. They are in or near the solar state of matter.

      <p><b>The Centers of <i>Prana</i>; The <i>Nadis</i>; The Tatwic
          Centers of Life; The Ordinary Change of Breath</b> </p>
      <p><i>Prana</i>, as already expressed, is that state of Tatwic
        matter which surrounds the sun, and in which moves the earth and
        other planets. It is the state next higher than matter in the
        terrestrial state. The terrestrial sphere is separated from the
        solar <i>Prana</i> by an <i>akasa</i>. This<i>akasa</i> is the
        immediate mother of the terrestrial <i>vayu</i> whose native
        color is blue. It is on this account that the sky looks blue. </p>
      <p>Although at this point in the heavens, the <i>Prana</i>
        changes into <i>akasa</i>, which gives birth to the terrestrial
        <i>Vayu</i>, the rays of the sun that fall on the sphere from
        without are not stopped in their inward journey. They are
        refracted, but move onwards into the terrestrial sphere all the
        same. Through these rays the ocean of <i>Prana</i>, which
        surrounds our sphere, exerts upon it an organizing influence. </p>
      <p>The terrestrial <i>Prana</i> -- the earth-life that appears in
        the shape of all the living organisms of our planet -- is, as a
        whole, nothing more than a modification of the solar <i>Prana</i>.
      </p>
      <p>As the earth moves round her own axis and round the sun,
        twofold centers are developed in the terrestrial <i>Prana</i>.
        During the diurnal rotation every place, as it is subjected to
        the direct influence of the sun, sends forth the positive
        life-current from the East to the West. During the night the
        same place sends forth the negative current. </p>
      <p>In the annual course the positive current travels from the
        North to the South during the six months of summer -- the day of
        the devas -- and the negative during the remaining six months --
        the night of the devas. </p>
      <p>The North and East are thus sacred to the positive current; the
        opposite quarters to the negative current. The sun is the lord
        of the positive current, the moon of the negative, because the
        negative solar <i>prana</i> comes during the night to the earth
        from the moon. </p>
      <p>The terrestrial <i>prana</i> is thus an ethereal being with
        double centers of work. The first is the northern, the second
        the southern. The two halves of these centers are the eastern
        and western centers. During the six months of summer the current
        of life runs from the North to the South, and during the months
        of winter the negative current goes the other way. </p>
      <p>With every month, with every day, with every <i>nimesha</i>
        this current completes a minor course, and while this current
        continues in this course the diurnal rotation gives it an
        eastern or western direction. The northern current runs during
        the day of man from East to West, and during the night from West
        to East. The directions of the other current are respectively
        opposite to the above. So practically there are only two
        directions -- the eastern and western. The difference of the
        northern and southern currents is not practically felt in
        terrestrial life. These two currents produce in the terrestrial
        <i>prana</i> two distinguishable modifications of the composing
        ethers. The rays of either of these ethereal modifications
        proceeding from their different centers run into each other --
        the one giving life, strength, form and other qualities to the
        other. Along the rays emerging from the northern center, run the
        currents of positive <i>prana</i>; along those emerging from
        the southern, the currents of negative <i>prana</i>. The
        eastern and western channels of these currents are respectively
        called <i>Pingala</i> and <i>Ida</i>, two of the celebrated
        nadis of the Tantrists. It will be better to discuss the other
        bearings of <i>Prana</i>, when we have localized it in the
        human body. </p>
      <p>The influence of this terrestrial <i>Prana</i> develops two
        centers of work in the gross matter that is to form a human
        body. Part of the matter gathers round the northern, and part
        round the southern center. The northern center develops into the
        brain; the southern into the heart. The general shape of the
        terrestrial <i>Prana</i> is something like an ellipse. In this
        the northern focus is in the brain; the southern in the heart.
        The column along which the positive matter gathers runs between
        these foci. </p>
      <p>The line in the middle is the place where the eastern and
        western -- right and left -- divisions of the column join. The
        column is the medulla oblongata the central line is also <i>susumna</i>,
        the right and left divisions the <i>Pingala</i> and <i>Ida</i>.
        The rays of <i>Prana</i> that diverge either way from these <i>nadis</i>
        are only their ramifications, and constitute together with them
        the nervous system. </p>
      <p>The negative <i>Prana</i> gathers round the southern center.
        This, too, takes a form similar to the former. The right and
        left divisions of this column are the right and left divisions
        of the heart. </p>
      <p>Each division has two principal ramifications, and each
        ramification again ramifies into others. The two openings either
        way are one a vein, and one an artery, the four opening into
        four chambers -- the four petals of the lotus of the heart. The
        right part of the heart again, with all its ramifications, is
        called <i>Pingala</i>, the left <i>Ida</i>, and the middle
        part <i>susumna</i>. </p>
      <p>There is reason to think, however, that the heart only is
        spoken of as the lotus, while the three foregoing names are set
        apart for the nervous system. The current of <i>Prana</i> works
        forward and backward, in and out. The cause of this lies in the
        momentary of the being of <i>Prana</i>. As the year advances,
        every moment a change of state takes place in the terrestrial <i>prana</i>,
        on account of the varying strengths of the solar and lunar
        currents. Thus, every moment is, strictly speaking, a new being
        of <i>Prana</i>. As Buddha says, all life is momentary. The
        Moment that is the first to throw into matter the germ that will
        develop the two centers is the first cause of organized life. If
        the succeeding Moments are friendly in their tatwic effect to
        the first cause, the organism gains strength and develops; if
        not, the impulse is rendered fruitless. The general effect of
        these succeeding moments keeps up general life; but the impulse
        of any one moment tends to pass off as the others come in. A
        system of forward and backward motion is thus established. One
        Moment of <i>Prana</i> proceeding from the center of work goes
        to the farthest ends of the gross vessels -- nerves and blood
        vessels -- of the organism. The succeeding moment gives it,
        however, the backwards impulse. A few moments are taken in the
        completion of the forward impulse, and the determination of the
        backward one. This period differs in different organisms. As the
        <i>Prana</i> runs forward, the lungs inspire; as it recedes, the
        process of expiration sets in. </p>
      <p>The <i>Prana</i> moves in the <i>Pingala</i> when it moves
        from the northern center towards the east, and from the southern
        towards the west; it moves in <i>Ida</i> when it moves from the
        northern center towards the west, and from the southern center
        towards the east. This means that in the former case the <i>Prana</i>
        moves from the brain, towards the right, through the heart, to
        the left and back to the brain; and from the heart to the left
        through the brain to the right back to the heart. In the latter
        the case is the reverse. To use other terms, in the former case
        the <i>Prana</i> moves from the nervous system to the right
        through the system of blood vessels to the left, and back again
        to the nervous system; or, from the system of blood vessels to
        the left through the nervous system to the right, and back again
        to the system of blood vessels. These two currents coincide. In
        the latter the case is the reverse. The left part of the body
        containing the nerves and the blood vessels may be called <i>Ida</i>,
        the right the <i>Pingala</i>. The right and left bronchi form
        as well the part respectively of <i>Pingala</i> and <i>Ida</i>,
        as any other parts of the right and left divisions of the body.
        But what is <i>susumna</i>? One of the names of <i>susumna</i>
        is <i>sandhi</i>, the place where the two -- <i>Ida</i> and <i>Pingala</i>
        -- join. It is really that place from which the <i>Prana</i>
        may move either way -- right or left -- or, under certain
        circumstances, both ways. It is that place which the <i>Prana</i>
        must pass when it changes from the right to the left, and from
        the left to the right. It is therefore booth the spinal canal
        and the cardiac canal. The spinal canal extends from the <i>Brahmarandhra</i>,
        the northern center of <i>Prana</i> through the whole vertebral
        column (<i>Brahmadanda</i>). The cardiac canal extends from the
        southern center midway between the two lobes of the heart. As
        the <i>Prana</i> moves from the spinal canal towards the right
        hand to the heart, the right lung works; the breath comes in and
        out of the right nostril. When it reaches the southern canal,
        you cannot feel the breath out of either nostril. As, however,
        it goes out of the cardiac canal to the left, the breath begins
        to come out of the left nostril, and flows through that until
        the <i>Prana</i> again reaches the spinal canal. There, again,
        you cease to feel the breath out of either nostril. The effect
        of these two positions of <i>Prana</i> is identical upon the
        flow of breath, and, therefore, I think that both the northern
        and southern canals are designated by <i>susumna</i>. If we may
        speak in this way, let us imagine that a plane passes midway
        between the spinal and cardiac canals. This plane will pass
        through the hollow of the <i>susumna</i>. But let it be
        understood that there is no such plane in reality. It will
        perhaps be more correct to say that as the rays of the positive
        <i>Ida</i> and <i>Pingala</i> spread either way as nerves, and
        those of the negative as blood-vessels, the rays of <i>susumna</i>
        spread all over the body midway between the nerves and blood
        vessels, the positive and negative <i>nadis</i>. The following
        is the description of <i>susumna</i> in the Science of Breath:
      </p>
      <p>"When the breath goes in and out, one moment by the left and
        the other by the right nostril, that too is <i>susumna</i>.
        When <i>Prana</i> is in that <i>nadi</i> the fires of death
        burn; this is called <i>vishuva</i>. When it moves one moment
        in the right, and the other in the left, let it be called the
        Unequal State (<i>vishamabhava</i>); when it moves thorough both
        at once, the wise have called it <i>vishuva</i>" </p>
      <p>"[It is <i>susumna</i>] at the time of the passing of the <i>Prana</i>
        from the <i>Ida</i> into the <i>Pingala</i>, or vice versa;
        and also of the change of one <i>tatwa</i> into another." </p>
      <p>Then the <i>susumna</i> has two other functions. It is called
        <i>vedo-veda</i> in one of its manifestations, and <i>sandhyasandhi</i>
        in the other. As, however, the right and left directions of the
        cardiac <i>Prana</i> coincide with the left and right of the
        spinal current, there are some writers who dispense with the
        double <i>susumna</i>. According to them, the spinal canal
        alone is the <i>susumna</i>. The <i>Uttaragita</i> and <i>Latachakra




          nirupana</i> are works in this class. This method of
        explanation takes away a good deal of difficulty. The highest
        recommendation of this view is its comparative simplicity. The
        right side current from the heart, and the left side current
        from the spine may both be reckoned without difficulty as the
        left side spinal currents, and so may the remaining two currents
        be reckoned as the right side spinal currents. </p>
      <p>One more consideration is in favor of this view. The nervous
        system represents the sun, the system of blood vessels the moon.
        Hence the real force of life dwells in the nerves. The positive
        and negative -- the solar and lunar -- phases of life matter are
        only different phases of <i>Prana</i>, the solar matter. The
        more distant and therefore the cooler matter is negative to the
        nearer, and therefore, the hotter. It is solar life that
        manifests itself in the various phases of the moon. To pass out
        of technicalities, it is nervous force that manifests itself in
        various forms, in the system of blood vessels. The blood vessels
        are only the receptacles of nervous force. Hence, in the nervous
        system, the real life of the gross body is the true <i>Ida</i>,
        <i>Pingala</i> and <i>susumna</i>. These are, in such a case,
        the spinal column, and the right and left sympathetics, with all
        their ramifications throughout the body. </p>
      <p>The development of the two centers is thus the first stage in
        the development of the fetus. The matter that gathers up under
        the influence of the northern center is the spinal column; the
        matter that gathers up round the southern center is the heart.
        The diurnal rotation divides these columns or canals into the
        right and left divisions. Then the correlative influence of
        these two centers upon each other develops an upper and lower
        division in each of these centers. This happens somewhat in the
        same way, and on the same principle, as a Leyden jar is charged
        with positive electricity by a negative rod. Each of these
        centers is thus divided into four parts: </p>
      <p>(1) The right side positive, (2) the left side positive, (3)
        the right side negative, and (4) the left side negative. </p>
      <p>In the heart these four divisions are called the right and left
        auricles and ventricles. The Tantras style these four divisions
        the four petals of the cardiac lotus, and indicate them by
        various letters. The positive petals of the heart form the
        center from which proceed the positive blood vessels, the
        arteries; the negative petals are the starting points of the
        negative blood vessels, the veins. This negative <i>prana</i>
        is pregnant with ten forces: </p>
      <p>(1) <i>Prana</i>, (2) <i>Apana</i>, (3) <i>Samana</i>, (4) <i>Vyana</i>,
        (5) <i>Udana</i>, (6) <i>Krikila</i>, (7) <i>Naga</i>, (8) <i>Devadatta</i>,
        (9) <i>Dhavanjaya</i>, (10) <i>Kurma</i>. </p>
      <p>These ten forces are called <i>vayu</i>. The word <i>vayu</i>
        is derived from the root <i>va</i>, to move, and means nothing
        more than a motive power. The Tantrists do not mean to give it
        the idea of a gas. Henceforth I shall speak of the <i>vayu</i>
        as the forces or motive powers of <i>prana</i>. These ten
        manifestations of <i>Prana</i> are reduced by some writers to
        the first five alone, holding that the remaining ones are only
        modifications of the former, which are the all-important of the
        functions of <i>prana</i>. This, however, is only a question of
        division. From the left side positive petal the <i>prana</i>
        gathers up into a <i>nadi</i> that ramifies within the chest
        into the lungs, and again gathers up into a <i>nadi</i> that
        opens into the right side negative petal. This entire course
        forms something like a circle (<i>chakra</i>). This <i>nadi</i>
        is called in modern science the pulmonary artery and vein. Two
        lungs come into existence by the alternate workings of the
        positive and negative <i>prana</i> of the eastern and western
        powers. </p>
      <p>Similarly, from the right side positive petal branch several <i>nadi</i>
        that go both upwards and downwards in two directions, the former
        under the influence of the northern, the latter under the
        influence of the southern powers. Both these <i>nadi</i> open
        after a circular march throughout the upper and lower portions
        of the body into the left side negative petal. </p>
      <p>Between the left side positive and the right side negative
        petal is one <i>chakra</i> (disk). This <i>chakra</i>
        comprises the pulmonary artery, the lungs, and the pulmonary
        vein. The chest gives room to this <i>chakra</i>, which is
        positive with respect to the lower portions of the body, in
        which run the ramifications of the lower <i>chakra</i>, which
        latter joins the right side positive and the left side negative
        petals. </p>
      <p>In the above <i>chakra</i> (in the cavity of the chest) is the
        seat of <i>prana</i>, the first and most important of the ten
        manifestations. Inspiration and expiration being a true index of
        the changes of <i>prana</i>, the pulmonary manifestations
        thereof have the same name. With the changes of <i>prana</i> we
        have a corresponding change in the other functions of life. The
        lower negative <i>chakra</i> contains the principal seats of
        some of the other manifestations of life. This <i>apana</i> is
        located in the long intestine, <i>samana</i> in the navel, and
        so on. </p>
      <p>Also, <i>udana</i> is located in the throat; <i>vyana</i> all
        over the body. <i>Udana</i> causes belching; <i>kurma</i> in
        the eyes causes them to shut and open; <i>krikila</i> in the
        stomach causes hunger. In short, proceeding from the four petals
        of the heart we have an entire network of these blood vessels.
        There are two sets of these blood vessels side by side in every
        part of the body, connected by innumerable little channels, the
        capillaries. </p>
      <p>We read in the <i>Prasnopnisat</i>: </p>
      <p>"From the heart [ramify the] <i>nadi</i>. Of these there are
        101 principal ones (<i>Pradhana nadi</i>). Each of these
        branches into 100. Each of these again into 72,000." </p>
      <p>Thus, there are 10,100 branch <i>nadi</i>, and 727,200,000
        still smaller ones, or what are called twig-<i>nadi</i>. The
        terminology is imitated from a tree. There is the root in the
        heart. From these proceed various stems. These ramify into
        branches, and these again into twig vessels; all these <i>nadi</i>
        put together are 727,210,201. </p>
      <p>Now, of these the one is the <i>susumna</i>; the rest are
        divided half and half over the two halves of the body. So we
        read in the <i>Kathopnishat</i>, 6th <i>valli</i>, 16th <i>mantra</i>:
      </p>
      <p>"A hundred and one <i>nadi</i> are connected with the heart.
        Of these one passes out into the head. Going out by that one
        becomes immortal. The others become the cause in sending the
        life principle out of various other states." </p>
      <p>This one that goes to the head, remarks the commentator, is the
        <i>susumna</i>. The <i>susumna</i> then is that <i>nadi</i>
        whose nervous substratum or reservoir of force is the spine. Of
        the remaining principal nadis, the <i>Ida</i> is the reservoir
        of the life force that works in the left part of the body,
        having 50 principal <i>nadi</i>. So also has the right part of
        the body 50 principal <i>nadi</i>. These go on dividing as
        above. The <i>nadi</i> of the third degree become so minute as
        to be visible only by a microscope. The ramifications of the <i>susumna</i>
        all over the body serve during life to carry the <i>prana</i>
        from the positive to the negative portions of the body, and <i>vice



          versa</i>. In case of blood these are the modern capillaries.
      </p>
      <p>The Vedantins, of course, take the heart to be the starting
        point of this ramification. The Yogis, however, proceed from the
        navel. Thus in <i>The Science of Breath</i> we read: </p>
      <p>"From the root in the navel proceed 72,000 <i>nadi</i>
        spreading all over the body. There sleeps the goddess <i>Kundalini</i>
        like a serpent. From this center (the navel) ten <i>nadi</i> go
        upwards, ten downwards, and two and two crookedly." </p>
      <p>The number 72,000 is the result of their own peculiar
        reckoning. It matters little which division we adopt if we
        understand the truth of the case. </p>
      <p>Along these <i>nadi</i> run the various forces that form and
        keep up the physiological man. These channels gather up into
        various parts of the body as centers of the various
        manifestations of <i>prana</i>. It is like water falling from a
        hill, gathering into various lakes, each lake letting out
        several streams. These centers are: </p>
      <p>(1) Hand power centers, (2) Foot power centers, (3) Speech
        power centers, (4) Excretive power centers, (5) Generative power
        centers, (6) Digestive and absorbing power centers, (7)
        Breathing power centers, and (8) the five sense power centers. </p>
      <p>Those <i>nadi</i> that proceed to the outlets of the body
        perform the most important functions of the body, and they are
        hence said to be the ten principal ones in the whole system.
        These are: </p>
      <p>(1) <i>Ghandari</i> goes to the left eye; (2) <i>Hastijihiva</i>
        goes to the right eye; (3) <i>Pasta</i> goes to the right ear;
        (4) <i>Yashawani</i> goes to the left ear; (5) <i>Alamhusha</i>,
        or <i>alammukha</i> (as it is variously spelled in one ms.)
        goes to the mouth. This evidently is the alimentary canal; (6) <i>Kuhu</i>
        goes to the generative organs; (7) <i>Shankini</i> goes to the
        excretive organs; (8) <i>Ida</i> is the <i>nadi</i> that leads
        to the left nostril; (9) <i>Pingala</i> is the one that leads
        to the right nostril. It appears that these names are given to
        these local <i>nadi</i> for the same reason that the pulmonary
        manifestation of <i>prana</i> is known by the same name; (10) <i>Susumna</i>
        has already been explained in its various phases and
        manifestations. </p>
      <p>There are two more outlets of the body that receive their
        natural development in the female: the breasts. It is quite
        possible that the <i>nadi Danini</i>, of which no specific
        mention has been made, might go to one of these. Whatever it may
        be, the principle of the division and classification is clear,
        and this is something actually gained. </p>
      <p>Centers of moral and intellectual powers also exist in the
        system. Thus we read in the <i>Vishramopnishat </i>(The
        following figure will serve to illustrate the translation): </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="pras1i.jpg" height="243" width="285"></p>
      </center>
      <p>"(1) While the mind rests in the eastern portion (or petal),
        which is white in color, then it is inclined towards patience,
        generosity, and reverence. </p>
      <p>"(2) While the mind rests in the southeastern portion, which is
        red in color, then it is inclined towards sleep, torpor and evil
        inclination. </p>
      <p>"(3) While the mind rests in the southern portion, which is
        black in color, then it is inclined towards anger, melancholy,
        and bad tendencies. </p>
      <p>"(4) While the mind rests in the southwestern portion, which is
        blue in color, then it is inclined towards jealousy and cunning.
      </p>
      <p>"(5) While the mind rests in the western portion, which is
        brown in color, then it is inclined towards smiles, amorousness,
        and jocoseness. </p>
      <p>"(6) While the mind rests in the northwestern portion, which is
        indigo in color, then it is inclined towards anxiety, restless
        dissatisfaction, and apathy. </p>
      <p>"(7) While the mind rests in the northern portion, which is
        yellow in color, then it is inclined towards love and enjoyment
        and adornment. </p>
      <p>"(8) While the mind rests in the northeastern portion, which is
        white in color, then it is inclined towards pity, forgiveness,
        reflection, and religion. </p>
      <p>"(9) While the mind rests in the <i>sandhi</i> (conjunctions)
        of these portions, then disease and confusion in body and home,
        and the mind inclines towards the three humors. </p>
      <p>"(10) While the mind rests in the middle portion, which is
        violet in color, then Consciousness goes beyond the qualities
        [three qualities of <i>Maya</i>] and it inclines toward
        Intelligence." </p>
      <p>When any of these centers is in action the mind is conscious of
        the same sort of feelings, and inclines towards them. Mesmeric
        passes serve only to excite these centers. </p>
      <p>These centers are located in the head as well as in the chest,
        and also in the abdominal region and the loins, etc. </p>
      <p>It is these centers, together with the heart itself, that bear
        the name of <i>padma</i> or <i>kamala</i> (lotus). Some of
        these are large, some small, some very small. A tantric lotus is
        the type of a vegetable organism, a root with various branches.
        These centers are the reservoirs of various powers, and hence
        the roots of the <i>padma</i>; the <i>nadi</i> ramifying these
        centers are their various branches. </p>
      <p>The nervous plexus of the modern anatomists coincide with these
        centers. From what has been said above it will appear that the
        centers are constituted by blood vessels. But the only
        difference between the nerves and the blood vessels is the
        difference between the vehicles of the positive and negative <i>prana</i>.
        The nerves are the positive, and the blood vessels are the
        negative system of the body. Wherever there are nerves there are
        corresponding blood vessels. Both of them are indiscriminately
        called <i>nadi</i>. One set has for its center the lotus of the
        heart, the other the thousand-petalled lotus of the brain. The
        system of blood vessels is an exact picture of the nervous
        system; it is, in fact, only its shadow. Like the heart, the
        brain has its upper and lower divisions -- the cerebrum and the
        cerebellum -- and its right and left divisions as well. The
        nerves going to very part of the body and coming back from
        thence together with those going to the upper and lower portions
        correspond to the four petals of the heart. This system, too,
        has as many centers of energy as the former. Both these centers
        coincide in position. They are, in fact, the same: the nervous
        plexuses and ganglia of modern anatomy. Thus, in my opinion, the
        tantric <i>padma</i> are not only the centers of nervous power
        -- the positive northern <i>prana</i> -- but necessarily of the
        negative <i>prana</i> as well. </p>
      <p>The translation of the <i>Science of Breath</i> that is now
        presented to the reader has two sections enumerating the various
        actions that are to be done during the flow of the positive and
        negative breath. They show nothing more than what can in some
        cases be very easily verified, that certain actions are better
        done by positive energy, and others by negative energy. The
        taking in of chemicals and their changes are actions, as well as
        any others. Some of the chemicals are better assimilated by the
        negative for example, milk and other fatty substances), others
        by the positive <i>Prana</i> (other food, that which is
        digested in the stomach). Some of our sensations produce more
        lasting effects upon the negative, others upon the positive <i>prana</i>.
      </p>
      <p><i>Prana</i> has now arranged the gross matter in the womb into
        the nervous and blood vessel systems. The <i>Prana</i>, as has
        been seen, is made of the five <i>tatwa</i>, and the <i>nadi</i>
        serve only as lines for tatwic currents to run on. The centers
        of power noticed above are centers of tatwic power. The tatwic
        centers in the right part of the body are solar, and those in
        the left are lunar. Both these solar and lunar centers are of
        five descriptions. Their kind is determined by what are called
        the nervous ganglia. The semi-lunar ganglia are the reservoirs
        of the <i>apas tatwa</i>. Similarly, we have the reservoirs of
        the other forces. From these central reservoirs the tatwic
        currents run over the same lines, and do the various actions
        allotted to them in physiological anatomy. </p>
      <p>Everything in the human body that has more less of the cohesive
        resistance is made up of the <i>prithivi tatwa</i>. But in this
        the various <i>tatwas</i> work imprinting differing qualities
        upon the various parts of the body. </p>
      <p>The <i>vayu tatwa</i>, among others, performs the functions of
        giving birth to, and nourishing the skin; the positive gives us
        the positive, and the negative the negative skin. Each of these
        has five layers: </p>
      <p>(1) Pure <i>vayu</i>, (2) <i>Vayu-agni</i>, (3) <i>Vayu-prithivi</i>,
        (4) <i>Vayu-apas</i>, (5) <i>Vayu-akasa</i>. These five
        classes of cells have the following figures: </p>
      <p>(1) Pure <i>Vayu</i> ~ This is the complete sphere of the <i>Vayu</i>:
      </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="pras1j.jpg" height="109" width="100"></p>
      </center>
      <p>(2) <i>Vayu-Agni</i> ~ The triangle is superposed over the
        sphere, and the cells have something like the following shape: </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="pras1k.jpg" height="57" width="183"></p>
      </center>
      <p>(3) <i>Vayu-Prithivi</i> ~ This is the result of the
        superposition of the quadrangular <i>Prithivi</i> over the
        spherical <i>Vayu</i>: </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="pras1l.jpg" height="47" width="155"></p>
      </center>
      <p>(4) <i>Vayu-Apas</i> ~ Something like an ellipse, the
        semi-moon superposed over the sphere: </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="pras1m.jpg" height="63" width="225"></p>
      </center>
      <p>(5) <i>Vayu-Akasa</i> ~ The sphere flattened by the
        superposition of the circle and dotted: </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="pras1n.jpg" height="69" width="145"></p>
      </center>
      <p>A microscopic examination of the skin will show that the cells
        of the skin have this appearance. </p>
      <p>Similarly, bone, muscle and fat are given birth to by the <i>prithivi</i>,
        the <i>agni</i>, and the <i>apas</i>. <i>Akasa</i> appears in
        various positions. Wherever there is any room for any substance,
        there is <i>akasa</i>. The blood is a mixture of nutritive
        substances kept in the fluidic state by the <i>apas tatwa</i>
        of <i>Prana</i>. </p>
      <p>It is thus seen that while Terrestrial <i>Prana</i> is an
        exact manifestation of the Solar <i>Prana</i>, the human
        manifestation is an exact manifestation of either. The microcosm
        is an exact picture of the macrocosm. The four petals of the
        lotus of the heart branch really into twelve <i>nadi</i> (<i>K,
          Kh, g, gn, n, K’, Kh’, j, jh, n, t, the</i>). Similarly the
        brain has twelve pairs of nerves. These are the twelve signs of
        the Zodiac, both in their positive and negative phases. In every
        sign the sun rises 31 times. Therefore we have 31 pairs of
        nerves. Instead of pairs, we speak in the language of the
        Tantras of a <i>chakra</i> (disk or circle). Wherever these 31
        <i>chakra</i> connect with the 12 pairs (<i>chakras</i>) of
        nerves in the brain, pass throughout the body, we have running
        side by side the blood vessels proceeding from the 12 <i>nadis</i>
        of the heart. The only difference between the spinal and cardiac
        <i>chakras</i> is that the former lie crosswise, while the
        latter lie lengthwise in the body. The sympathetic chords
        consist of lines of tatwic centers: the <i>padma</i> or <i>kamal</i>.
        These centers lie on all the 31 <i>chakra</i> noticed above.
        Thus from the two centers of work, the brain and the heart, the
        signs of the Zodiac in their positive and negative aspects -- a
        system of <i>nadi</i> branch off. The <i>nadi</i> from either
        center run into one another so much that one set is found always
        side by side with the other. The 31 <i>chakra</i> are various
        tatwic centers; one set is positive, and the other is negative.
        The former owe allegiance to the brain, with which they are
        connected by the sympathetic chords; the latter owe allegiance
        to the heart, with which they have various connections. This
        double system is called <i>Pingala</i> on the right side, and <i>Ida</i>
        on the left. The ganglia of the <i>apas</i> centers are
        semi-lunar, those of the <i>taijas</i>, the <i>vayu</i>, the <i>prithivi</i>,
        and the <i>akasa</i> respectively triangular, spherical,
        quadrangular, and circular. Those of the composite <i>tatwa</i>
        have composite figures. Each tatwic center has ganglia of all
        the <i>tatwa</i> surrounding it. </p>
      <p><i>Prana</i> moves in this system of <i>nadi</i>. As the sun
        passes into the sign of Aries in the Macrocosm, the <i>Prana</i>
        passes into the corresponding <i>nadi</i> (nerves) of the
        brain. From thence it descends every day towards the spine. With
        the rise of the sun it descends into the first spinal <i>chakra</i>
        towards the right. It thus passes into the <i>Pingala</i>. It
        moves along the nerves of the right side, at the same time
        passing little by little into the blood vessels. Up to noon of
        every day the strength of this <i>Prana</i> is greater in the
        nervous chakra than in the venous. At noon they become of equal
        strength. In the evening (with sunset), the <i>Prana</i> with
        its entire strength has passed into the blood vessels. From
        thence it gathers up into the heart, the negative southern
        center. Then it spreads into the left side blood vessels,
        gradually passing into the nerves. At midnight the strength is
        equalized; in the morning (<i>pratasandhia</i>) the <i>prana</i>
        is just in the spine; from thence it begins to travel along the
        second <i>chakra</i>. This is the course of the solar current
        of <i>prana</i>. The moon gives birth to other minor currents.
        The moon moves 12 odd times more than the sun. Therefore, while
        the sun passes over one <i>chakra</i> (i.e., during 60 <i>ghari</i>
        -- day and night), the moon passes over 12 odd <i>chakra</i>.
        Therefore we have 12 odd changes of <i>prana</i> during 24
        hours. Suppose the moon too begins in Aries; she begins like the
        sun in the first <i>chakra</i>, and takes 58 min. 4 sec. in
        reaching the spine to the heart, and as many minutes from the
        heart back to the spine. </p>
      <p>Both these <i>prana</i> move in their respective course along
        the tatwic centers. Either of them is present at any one time
        all over the same class of tatwic centers, in any one part of
        the body. It manifests itself first in the <i>vayu</i> centers,
        then in the <i>taijas</i>, thirdly in the <i>prithivi</i>, and
        fourthly in the <i>apas</i> centers. <i>Akasa</i> comes after
        each, and immediately precedes the <i>susumna</i>. As the lunar
        current passes from the spine towards the right, the breath
        comes out of the right nostril, and as long as the current of <i>Prana</i>
        remains in the back part of the body, the <i>tatwa</i> changes
        from the <i>vayu</i> to the <i>apas</i>. As the current passes
        into the front part of the right half, the <i>tatwa</i> changes
        back from the <i>apas</i> to the <i>vayu</i>. As the prana
        passes into the heart, the breath is not felt at all in the
        nose. As it proceeds from the heart to the left, the breath
        begins to flow out of the left nostril, and as long as it is in
        the front part of the body, the <i>tatwa</i> change from the <i>vayu</i>
        to the <i>apas</i>. They change back again a before, until the
        <i>prana</i> reaches the spine, when we have the <i>akasa</i>
        of <i>susumna</i>. Such is the even change of <i>prana</i>
        that we have in the state of perfect health. The impulse that
        has been given to the localized <i>prana</i> by the sun and
        moon forces that give active power and existence to its
        prototype <i>Prana</i>, makes it work in the same way forever
        and ever. The working of the human free will and other forces
        change the nature of the local prana, and individualize it in
        such a way as to render it distinguishable from the universal
        Terrestrial and Ecliptical <i>prana</i>. With the varying
        nature of prana, the order of the <i>tatwa</i> and the positive
        and negative currents may be affected in various degrees.
        Disease is the result of this variation. In fact, the flow of
        breath is the truest indication of the changes of <i>tatwa</i>
        in the body. The balance of the positive and negative currents
        of <i>tatwa</i> results in health, and the disturbance of their
        harmony in disease. The science of the flow of breath is
        therefore of the highest importance to every man who values his
        own health and that of his fellow creatures. At the same time,
        it is the most important, useful and comprehensive, the easiest
        and the most interesting branch of <i>Yoga</i>. It teaches us
        how to guide our will so as to effect desired changes in the
        order and nature of our positive and negative tatwic currents.
        This it does in the following way. All physical action is prana
        in a certain state. Without <i>prana</i> there is no action,
        and every action is the result of the differing harmonies of
        tatwic currents. Thus, motion in any one part of the body is the
        result of the activity of the <i>vayu</i> centers in that part
        of the body. In the same way, whenever there is activity in the
        <i>prithivi</i> centers, we have a feeling of enjoyment and
        satisfaction. The causes of the other sensations are similar. </p>
      <p>We find that while lying down we change sides when the breath
        passes out of that nostril. Therefore we conclude that if we lie
        on any side the breath will flow out the opposite nostril.
        Therefore, whenever we see that it is desirable to change the
        negative conditions of our body to the positive, we resort to
        this expedient. An investigation into the physiological effects
        of <i>prana</i> on the gross coil, and the counter effects of
        gross action upon <i>prana</i>, will form the subject of the
        next essay. </p>
      <p><a name="v"></a><b><font size="+1">V.&nbsp; <i>Prana</i> (II)
            ~</font></b> </p>
      <p>The <i>Pranamaya Kosha</i> (Coil of Life) changes into three
        general states during day and night: the waking, the dreaming,
        and the sleeping (<i>jagrata, swapna, susupti</i>). These three
        changes produce corresponding changes in the <i>manamaya Kosha</i>
        (the mental coil), and thence arises the consciousness of the
        changes of life. The mind, in fact, lies behind the <i>prana</i>.
        The strings (tatwic lines) of the former instrument are finer
        than those of the latter; that is, in the former we have a
        greater number of vibrations than in the latter during the same
        space of time. Their tensions stand to each other, however, in
        such a relation that with the vibrations of the one, the other
        of itself begins to vibrate. The changes give to the mind,
        therefore, a similar appearance, and consciousness of the
        phenomenon is caused. This, however, some time after. My present
        object is to describe all those changes of <i>prana</i>,
        natural or induced, that make up the sum total of our worldly
        experience, and which, during ages of evolution, have called the
        mind itself out of the state of latency. These changes, as I
        have said, divide themselves into three general states: the
        waking, the dreaming, and the sleeping. Waking is the positive,
        sleeping the negative state of prana; dreaming is the
        conjunction of the two (<i>susumna sandhi</i>). As stated in the
        foregoing essay, the solar current travels in a positive
        direction during the day, and we are awake. As night approaches
        the positive current has made itself lord of the body. It gains
        so much strength that the sensuous and active organs lose
        sympathy with the external world. Perception and action cease,
        and the waking state passes off. The excess of the positive
        current slackens, as it were, the tatwic chords of the different
        centers of work, and they accordingly cease to answer to the
        ordinary ethereal changes of external nature. If at this point
        the strength of the positive current passed beyond ordinary
        limits, death would ensue, <i>pran</i>a would cease to have any
        connection with the gross body, the ordinary vehicle of the
        external tatwic changes. But just at the moment the <i>prana</i>
        passes out of the heart, the negative current sets in, and it
        begins to counteract the effects of the former. As the <i>prana</i>
        reaches the spine, the effects of the positive current have
        entirely passed of, and we awake. If at this moment the strength
        of the negative current passes the ordinary limit by some cause
        or other, death would ensue, but just at this moment the
        positive current sets in with midnight, and begins to counteract
        the effect of the former. A balance of the positive and negative
        currents thus keeps body and soul together.&nbsp; With excess in
        the strength of either current, death makes its appearance. Thus
        we see that there are two kinds of death: the positive or
        spinal, and the negative or cardiac. In the former the four
        higher principles pass out of the body through the head, the <i>brahmarandhra</i>,
        along the spine; in the latter they pass out of the mouth
        through the lungs and the trachea. Besides these there are
        generally speaking about six tatwic deaths. All these deaths
        chalk out different paths for the higher principle. Of these,
        however, more hereafter. At this stage, let us investigate the
        changes of <i>prana</i> more thoroughly. </p>
      <p>There are certain manifestations of <i>prana</i> that we find
        equally at work in all three states. As I have said before, some
        writers have divided these manifestations into five heads. They
        have different centers of work in different parts of the body,
        from whence they assert their dominion over every part of the
        physical coil. Thus: </p>
      <p>Positive: (1) <i>Prana</i>, right lung; Negative: <i>Prana</i>,
        left lung. <i>Prana</i> is that manifestation of the life coil
        which draws atmospheric air from without into the system. </p>
      <p>Positive: (2) <i>Apana</i>, the apparatus that passes off
        feces, long intestine, etc.; Negative:&nbsp; <i>Apana</i>, the
        urinary apparatus. <i>Apana</i> is the manifestation that
        throws, from the inside, out of the system, things that are not
        wanted there. </p>
      <p>Positive: (3) <i>Samana</i>, stomach; Negative: <i>Samana</i>,
        duodenum. <i>Samana</i> is that manifestation which draws in
        and carries the juice of food to every part of the body. </p>
      <p>Positive: (4) <i>Vyana</i>, all over the body, appearing in
        varying states with different organs (on the right side);
        Negative: <i>Vyana</i>, all over the body (on the left side). <i>Vyana</i>
        is that manifestation which inclines the currents of life back
        to the centers -- the heart and the brain. It is, therefore,
        this manifestation that causes death, local or general. </p>
      <p>Positive: (5) <i>Udana</i>, at the spinal and cardiac centers
        (right side), and the region of the throat; Negative: <i>Udana</i>,
        the spinal and cardiac centers (left side). </p>
      <p>If <i>Prana</i> recedes from any part of the body (for some
        reason or other), that part loses its power of action. This is
        local death. It is in this way that we become deaf, dumb, blind,
        etc. It is in this way that our digestive powers suffer, and so
        on. General death is similar in its operations. With the excess
        of the strength of either of the two currents, the <i>prana</i>
        remains in the <i>susumna</i>, and does not pass out. The
        acquired power of work of the body then beings to pass off. The
        farther from the centers (the heart and the brain), the sooner
        they die. It is thus that the pulse first ceases to be felt in
        the extremities, and then nearer and nearer the heart, until we
        find it nowhere. </p>
      <p>Again, it is this upward impulse that, under favorable
        conditions, causes growth, lightness, and agility. </p>
      <p>Besides the organs of the body already mentioned or indicated,
        the manifestation of <i>vyana</i> serves to keep in form the
        five organs of sense, and the five organs of action. The organs
        of the gross body and the powers of <i>prana</i> that manifest
        themselves in work have both the same names. Thus we have: </p>
      <p>Active Organs &amp; Powers: (1) <i>Vak</i>, the coal organs
        and the power of speech; (2) <i>Pani</i>, the hands and the
        manual power; (3) <i>Pada</i>, the feet and the walking power;
        (4) <i>Payu</i>, anus; (5) <i>Upastha</i>, the generative
        organs and the powers that draw these together. </p>
      <p>Sensuous Organs &amp; Powers: (1) <i>Chaksus</i>, eye and
        ocular power; (2) <i>Twak</i>, skin and tangiferous power; (3)
        <i>Srotra</i>, ear and sonoriferous power; (4) <i>Rasama</i>,
        tongue and gustatory power; (5) <i>Cobrana</i>, nose and
        odoriferous power. </p>
      <p>The real fact is that the different powers are the
        corresponding organs of the principle of life. It will now be
        instructive to trace the tatwic changes and influences of these
        various manifestations of life. </p>
      <p><i>Prana</i>: During health <i>prana</i> works all over the
        system in one class of tatwic centers at one time. We thus see
        that both during the course of the positive and negative current
        we have five tatwic changes. The color of <i>prana</i> during
        the reign of the positive and negative current is pure white;
        during that of the positive, reddish white. The former is calmer
        and smoother than the latter. </p>
      <p>The tatwic changes give to each of these five new phases of
        color. Thus: </p>
      <p>Positive ~ reddish white/ Negative ~ pure white: </p>
      <p>(1) The <i>vayu tatwa</i>, blue; (2) The <i>agni tatwa</i>,
        red; (3) The <i>prithivi</i>, yellow; (4) The <i>apas</i>,
        white; (5) The <i>akasa tatwa</i>, dark </p>
      <p>It is evident that there is a difference between the positive
        and negative tatwic phases of color. There are thus ten general
        phases of color. </p>
      <p>The positive current (reddish white) is hotter than the
        negative (the pure white). Therefore it may be generally said
        that the positive current is hot, and the negative cool. Each of
        these then undergoes five tatwic changes of temperature. The <i>agni</i>
        is the hottest, the yellow next to it; the <i>vayu</i> becomes
        cool, and the <i>apas</i> is the coolest. The <i>akasa</i> has
        a state that neither cools nor heats. This state is the most
        dangerous of all, and if prolonged it causes death, disease and
        debility. It is evident that, if the cooling <i>tatw</i>a does
        not set in to counteract the accumulated effect of the latter in
        due time, the functions of life will be impaired. The just color
        and the just temperature at which these functions work in their
        vigor will be disturbed, and disease, death and debility are
        nothing more than this disturbance in various degrees. The case
        is similar if the heating <i>tatwa</i> does not set in in due
        time after the cooling one. </p>
      <p>It will be easy to understand that these changes of tatwic
        colors and temperatures are not abrupt. The one passes of easily
        and smoothly into the other, and the tatwic mixtures produce
        innumerable colors -- as many, in fact, as the solar <i>prana</i>
        has been shown to possess. Each of these colors tend to keep the
        body healthy if it remains in action just as long as it ought,
        but no sooner does the duration change than disease results.
        There is a possibility, therefore, of as many and more diseases
        as there are colors in the sun. </p>
      <p>If any one color is prolonged, there must be some one or more
        that have given the period of their duration to it; similarly,
        if one color takes less time than it ought to, there must be
        some one or more that take its place. This suggests two methods
        of the treatment of diseases. But before speaking of these, it
        will be necessary to investigate as fully as possible the causes
        that lengthen and shorten the ideal periods of the <i>tatwas</i>.
      </p>
      <p>To return at present to <i>Prana</i>: This pulmonary
        manifestation of the principle of life is the most important of
        all, because its workings furnish us with a most faithful
        measure of the tatwic state of the body. It is on this account
        that the name <i>prana</i> has been given by pre-eminence to
        this manifestation. </p>
      <p>Now, as the <i>prana</i> works in the pulmonary<i> taijas</i>
        centers (i.e., the centers of the luminiferous ether), the lungs
        are thrown into a triangular form of expansion, atmospheric air
        runs in, and the process of inspiration is complete. With every<i>
          truti</i>, a backwards impulse is given to the currents of <i>prana</i>.
        The lungs are thrown into their stationary state with this
        returning current, and the excess air is expelled. The air that
        is thus thrown out of the lungs bears a triangular form. To some
        extent, the water vapor that this air contains furnishes us with
        a method of testing this truth by experiment. If we take a
        smooth, shining looking glass, put it under the nose, and breath
        steadily upon its cool surface, the water vapor of the air will
        be condensed, and it will be seen that this bears a particular
        figure. In the case of pure <i>agni</i>, this figure will be a
        triangle. Let another person look steadily at the looking glass
        because the impression passes off rather quickly. </p>
      <p>With the course of the other <i>tatwas</i> the lungs are
        thrown into their respective shapes, and the looking glass gives
        us the same figures. Thus, in <i>apas </i>we have the
        semi-moon, in <i>vayu</i> the sphere, and in <i>prithivi</i>
        the quadrangle. With the composition of these <i>tatwas</i> we
        may have other figures: oblongs, squares, spheroids, and so on.
      </p>
      <p>It may also be mentioned that the luminiferous ether carries
        the materials drawn from the atmospheric air to the centers of
        the luminiferous ether, and thence to every part of the body.
        The other ethers also carry these materials to their respective
        centers. It is not necessary to trace the working of the other
        manifestations one by one. It may, however, be said that
        although all the five <i>tatwas</i> work in all the five
        manifestations, each of these manifestations is sacred to one of
        these tatwas. Thus in <i>prana</i> the <i>vayu tatwa</i>
        prevails, in s<i>amana</i> the <i>agni</i>, in <i>apana</i>
        the <i>prithivi</i>, in <i>vyana</i> the <i>apas</i>, in <i>udana</i>
        the <i>akasa</i>. I may remind the reader that the general
        color of <i>prana</i> is white, and this will show how the <i>apas



          tatwa</i> prevails in <i>Vyana</i>. The darkness of <i>akasa</i>
        is the darkness of death, etc., caused by the manifestation of <i>udana</i>.
      </p>
      <p>During life these ten changes are always taking place at the
        intervals of about 26 minutes each. In waking, in sleep, or in
        dream, these changes never cease. It is only in the two <i>susumnas</i>
        or the <i>akasa</i> that these changes become potential for a
        moment, because it is from these that these tatwic
        manifestations show themselves on the plane of the body. If this
        moment is prolonged, the forces of <i>prana</i> remain
        potential, and in death the <i>prana</i> is thus in the
        potential state. When those causes that tended to lengthen the
        period of i, and thus cause death, are removed, this individual
        <i>prana</i> passes out of the potential into the actual,
        positive, or negative state as the case may be. It will energize
        matter, and will develop it into the shape towards which its
        accumulated potentialities tend. </p>
      <p>Something may now be said about the work of the sensuous and
        active organs. </p>
      <p>It may be generally said that all work is tatwic motion. This
        work is capable of being carried on during the waking state, and
        not in sleep or dream. These ten organs have ten general colors,
        generally thus: </p>
      <p>Sensuous Organs: (1) Eye, <i>agni</i>, red; (2) Ear, <i>akasa</i>,
        dark; (3) Nose, <i>prithivi</i>, yellow; (4) Tongue (taste), <i>apas</i>,
        white; (5) Skin, <i>vayu</i>, blue; </p>
      <p>Active Organs: (1) Hand,<i> vayu</i>, blue; (2) Foot, i,
        yellow; (3) Tongue (speech), <i>apas</i>, white; (4) Anus, <i>akasa</i>,
        dark; (5) Genitals, i, red. </p>
      <p>Although these are the generally prevalent tatwas in these
        various centers, all the other <i>tatwas</i> exist in a
        subordinate position. Thus in the eye we have a reddish yellow,
        reddish white, reddish dark, reddish blue, and similarly in the
        other organs. This division into five of each of these colors is
        only general; in reality there is an almost innumerable
        variation of colors in each of these. </p>
      <p>With every act of every one of these ten organs, the organ
        specially and the whole body generally assumes a different
        color, the color of that particular tatwic motion which
        constitutes that act. </p>
      <p>All these changes of <i>Prana</i> constitute the sum total of
        our worldly experience. Furnished with this apparatus, <i>prana</i>
        begins its human pilgrimage, in company with a mind, which is
        evolved only to the extent of connecting the "I am" of the <i>ahankara</i>
        or <i>vijnana</i>, the fourth principle from below, with these
        manifestations of <i>prana</i>. Time imprints upon it all the
        innumerable colors of the universe. The visual, the tangible,
        the gustatory, the auditory, and the olfactory appearances in
        all their variety gather into <i>prana</i> just as our daily
        experience carries many messages at one and the same time. In
        the same way do the appearances of the active organs, and the
        five remaining general functions of the body, gather up in this
        <i>prana</i> to manifest themselves in due time. </p>
      <p>A few illustrations will render all this clear: </p>
      <p><b>Sexual Relations ~</b> </p>
      <p>The generative <i>agni tatwa</i> of the male is positive, and
        that of the female is negative. The former is hotter, harsher,
        and more restless than the latter; the latter is cooler,
        smoother, and calmer than the former. These two currents tend to
        run into each other, and a feeling of satisfaction is the result
        if the two currents are allowed to take their course; if not, a
        feeling of uneasiness is the result. The genesis of these
        feelings will be my subject under the head of the <i>manomaya
          kosha</i> (mental principle). Here I shall only speak of the
        coloration of <i>prana</i> by the action or inaction of this
        organ. The positive <i>agni</i> tends to run into the negative,
        and vice versa. If it is not allowed to do so, the repeated
        impulses of this <i>tatwa</i> turn upon themselves, the center
        gains strength, and every day the whole <i>prana</i> is colored
        deeper and deeper red. The centers of the <i>agni tatwa</i> all
        over the body become stronger in their action, while all the
        others contract a general tinge of the red. The eyes and the
        stomach become stronger. This, however, is the case only within
        certain limits and under certain circumstances. If the <i>agni</i>
        gains too much strength, all the other centers of the remaining
        tatwas become vitiated in their action by an over-coloration of
        <i>agni</i>, and disease and debility result. If, however, man
        indulges in this luxury more often than he should, and in more
        than one place, the male <i>prana</i> gets colored by the
        female <i>agni</i>, and vice versa. This tends to weaken all
        the centers of this <i>tatwa</i>, and gives a feminine color to
        the whole <i>prana</i>. The stomach becomes cooled down, the
        eyes grow weak, and virile manly power departs. If, however,
        more than one individual female <i>agni</i> takes possession of
        the male <i>prana</i>, and vice versa, the general antagonistic
        <i>tatwa</i> becomes deeper and stronger. The whole <i>prana</i>
        is vitiated to a greater extent, greater debility is the result,
        and spermatorrhea, impotence, and other such antagonistic colors
        take possession of the <i>prana</i>. Besides, the separate
        individualities of the male or female <i>agni</i> that has
        taken possession of any one <i>prana</i> will tend to repel
        each other. </p>
      <p><b>Walking ~</b> </p>
      <p>Suppose now that a man is given to walking. The <i>prithivi
          tatwa</i> of the feet gains strength, and the yellow color
        pervades the whole <i>prana</i>. The centers of the <i>prithivi</i>
        all over the body begin to work more briskly; <i>agni</i>
        receives a mild and wholesome addition to its power, the whole
        system tends towards healthy equilibrium, neither too hot, nor
        too cold, and a general feeling of satisfaction accompanied with
        vigor, playfulness, and a relish of enjoyment is the result. </p>
      <p><b>Speech ~</b> </p>
      <p>Let me take one more illustration from the operation of <i>Vak</i>
        (speech), and I shall be done with the organs of action. The
        power (<i>Sakti</i>) of speech (<i>Vak, saraswati</i>) is one of
        the most important goddesses of the Hindu pantheon. The <i>apas
          tatwa</i> is the chief ingredient of <i>prana</i> that goes
        towards the formation of this organ. Therefore the color of the
        goddess is said to be white. The vocal chord with the larynx in
        front form the <i>vina</i> (musical instrument) of the goddess.
      </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="pras1o.jpg" height="281" width="139"></p>
      </center>
      <p>In the above figure of the vocal apparatus, AB is the thyroid,
        a broad cartilage forming the projection of the throat, and much
        more prominent in men than in women. Below this is the annular
        cartilage C, the crecoid. Behind this, or we may say on this,
        are stretched the chord a and b. </p>
      <p>Atmospheric air passing over these chords in the act of
        breathing sets these chords in vibration, and sound is the
        result. Ordinarily these chords are too loose to give any sound.
        The <i>apas tatwa</i>, the milk-white goddess of speech,
        performs the all-important function of making these chords
        tense. As the semi-lunar current of the apas tatwa passes along
        the muscles of these chords, they are as it were shriveled up
        and curves are formed in the chords; they become tighter. </p>
      <p>The depth of these curves depends upon the strength of the <i>apas</i>
        current. The deeper these curves, the tenser are the chords. The
        thyroid serves to vary the intensity of the voice thus produced.
        The thyroid serves to vary the intensity of the voice thus
        produced. This will do here, and it is enough to show that the
        real motive power in the production of voice is the <i>apas
          tatwa</i> or <i>Prana</i>. As will be easily understood,
        there are certain ethereal conditions of the external world that
        excite the centers of the <i>apas tatwa</i>; the current passes
        along the vocal chords, they are made tense, and sound is
        produced. But the excitement of these centers also comes from
        the soul through the mind. The use of this sound in the course
        of evolution as the vehicle of thought is the marriage of <i>Brahma</i>
        (the <i>Vijana mayakosha</i>, the soul) with <i>Saraswati</i>,
        the power of speech as located in man. </p>
      <p>The <i>apas tatwa</i> of the vocal apparatus, although it is
        the chief motive power in the production of sound, is modified
        according to the circumstance by the composition of the other
        tatwas in various degrees. As far as human ken reaches, about 49
        of these variations have been recorded under the name of <i>swara</i>.
        First, there are seven general notes. These may be positive and
        negative (<i>tivra</i> and <i>komala</i>), and then each of
        these may have three subdivisions. These notes are then composed
        into eight <i>raga</i>, and each <i>raga</i> has several <i>ragini</i>.
        The simple <i>ragini</i> may then be compounded into others,
        and each <i>ragini</i> may have a good many arrangements of
        notes. The variations of sound thus become almost innumerable.
        All these variations are caused by the varying tensions of the
        vocal chords, the <i>Vina</i> of <i>Saraswati</i>, and the
        tensions vary by the varying strength of the <i>apas</i>
        current, caused by the superposition of the other <i>tatwas</i>.
      </p>
      <p>Each variation of sound has a color of its own that affects the
        whole <i>prana</i> in its own way; the tatwic effect of all
        these sounds is noted in books of music. Various diseases may be
        cured, and good or bad tendencies imprinted on the <i>prana</i>
        by the power of sound. <i>Saraswati</i> is an all-powerful
        goddess, and controls our <i>prana</i> for good or evil as the
        case may be. If a song or note is colored by the <i>agni tatwa</i>,
        the sound colors the <i>prana</i> red, and similarly the <i>vayu</i>,
        the <i>apas</i>, the <i>akasa</i>, and the <i>prithivi</i>,
        blue, white, dark, and yellow. The red colored song causes heat;
        it may cause anger, sleep, digestion, and redness of color. The
        <i>akasa</i> colored song causes fear, forgetfulness, etc. Songs
        may similarly give our <i>prana</i> the color of love, enmity,
        adoration, morality, or immorality, as the case may be. </p>
      <p>Let us turn to another key. If the words we utter bear the
        color of the <i>agni tatwa</i> -- anger, love, lust -- our <i>prana</i>
        is colored red, and this redness turns upon ourselves. It may
        burn up our substance, and we may look lean and lank and have
        10,000 other diseases. Terrible retribution of angry words! If
        our words are full of divine love and adoration, kindness and
        morality, words that give pleasure and satisfaction to whoever
        hears them -- the colors of the <i>prithivi</i> and the <i>apas</i>
        -- we become loving and beloved, adoring and adored, kind and
        moral, pleasing and pleased, satisfying and ever satisfied. The
        discipline of speech itself -- the <i>satya</i> of Patanjali --
        is thus one of the highest practices of <i>Yoga</i>. </p>
      <p>Sensuous impressions color the prana in a similar way. If we
        are given to too much of sight-seeing, to the hearing of
        pleasant sounds, to the smelling of dainty smells, etc., the
        colors of these <i>tatwas</i> will be overly strengthened, and
        will gain a mastery over our <i>prana</i>. If we are too fond
        of seeing beautiful women, hearing the music of their voices,
        heaven help us, for the least and most general effect will be
        that our <i>pranas</i> will receive the feminine coloration. If
        it were only for the love of women, man should avoid this
        over-indulgence, for feminine qualities in men do not obtain
        favor in the eyes of women. </p>
      <p>These illustrations are sufficient to explain how the tatwic
        colors of external nature gather up in <i>prana</i>. It may be
        necessary to say that no new colors enter into the formation of
        <i>prana</i>. All the colors of the universe are present there
        already, just as they are in the sun, the prototype of <i>prana</i>.
        The coloration I have spoken of is only the strengthening of
        this particular color to an extent that throws the others in
        shade. It is this disturbance of balance that in the first place
        causes the variety of human <i>prana</i>, and in the second
        those innumerable diseases to which flesh is heir. </p>
      <p>From this point it is evident that every action of man gives
        his <i>prana</i> a separate color, and the color affects the
        gross body in turn. But when, at what time, does the particular
        tatwic color affect the body? Ordinarily it is under similar
        tatwic conditions of the external universe. This means that if
        the <i>agni tatwa</i> has gained strength in any <i>prana</i>
        at any one particular division of time, the strength will show
        itself when that particular division of time recurs again.
        Before attempting a solution of this problem, it is necessary to
        understand the following truths: </p>
      <p>The sun is the chief life-giver of every organism in the
        system. The moment that a new organism has come into existence,
        the sun changes his capacity in relation to that organism. He
        now becomes the sustainer of positive life in that organism.
        Along with this the moon begins to influence the organism in her
        own way. She becomes the sustainer of negative life. The planets
        each establish their own currents in the organism. For the sake
        of simplicity, I have as yet spoken only of the sun and moon,
        the respective lords of the positive and negative currents of
        the right and left halves of the body, of the brain and the
        heart, of the nerves and the blood vessels. These are the two
        chief sources of life, but it must be remembered that the
        planets exercise a modifying influence over these currents. The
        real tatwic condition of any moment is determined by all the
        seven planets, just like the sun and the moon. Each planet,
        after determining the general tatwic condition of the moment,
        goes to introduce changes in the organism born at that moment.
        These changes correspond with the manifestation of that color of
        <i>prana</i> that rose at that time. Thus, suppose the red color
        has entered <i>prana</i> when the moon is in the second degree
        of the sign of Libra. If there is no disturbing influence of any
        other luminary, the red color will manifest itself whenever the
        moon is in the same position; in the other case, when the
        disturbing influence is removed. It may show itself in a month,
        or it may be postponed for ages. It is very difficult to
        determine the time when an act will have its effect. It depends
        a good deal upon the strength of the impression. The strength of
        the impression may be divided into ten degrees, although some
        writers have gone further. </p>
      <p>(1) Momentary: This degree of strength has its effect then and
        there; </p>
      <p>(2) 30 degrees strength: In this case the effect will show
        itself when each planet is in the same sign as at the time of
        the impression; </p>
      <p>(3) 15 degrees strength: <i>Hora</i>; (4) 10 degrees strength:
        <i>Dreskana</i>; (5) 200 degrees strength:<i> Navaansha</i>; (6)
        150 degrees strength: <i>Dwadasansa</i>; (7) 60 or 1 degree
        strength: <i>Trinsansa</i>; (8) 1" strength: <i>Kala</i>; (9)
        1’’’ strength: <i>Vipala</i>; (10) 1’’’’ strength: <i>Truti</i>.
      </p>
      <p>Suppose in any <i>prana</i>, on account of any action, the <i>agni




          tatwa</i> obtains the strongest possible prevalence consistent
        with the preservation of the body, the <i>tatwa</i> will begin
        to have its effect then and there until it has exhausted itself
        to a certain extent. It will then become latent and show itself
        when at any time the same planets sit in the same mansions.
        Examples will illustrate better. Suppose the following
        advancement of the planets at any moment denotes the tatwic
        condition when any given color has entered the <i>prana</i>: </p>

      <p>It is at this time, we suppose, that the act above referred to
        is committed. The present effect will pass off with the two
        hours’ lunar current that may be passing at that time. Then it
        will become latent, and remain so till the time when these
        planets are in the same position again. As has been seen, these
        positions might be nine or more in number. </p>
      <p>As soon as the exact time passes of when a color has obtained
        predominance in prana, the effect thereof on the gross body
        becomes latent. It shows itself again in a general way when the
        stars sit in the same mansions. Some of the strength is worn off
        at this time, and the force becomes latent to show itself in
        greater minuteness when at any time the half-mansions coincide,
        and so on with the remaining parts noticed above. There may be
        any number of times when there is only an approach to
        coincidence, and then the effect will tend to show itself,
        though at that time it will remain only a tendency. </p>
      <p>These observation, although necessarily very meager, tend to
        show that the impression produced upon <i>prana</i> by any act,
        however insignificant, really takes ages to pass off, when the
        stars coincide in position to a degree with that when the act
        was committed. Therefore, a knowledge of astronomy is highly
        essential in occult Vedic religion. The following observation
        may, however, render the above a little more intelligible. </p>
      <p>As often remarked, the <i>prana mayokosha</i> is an exact
        picture of the Terrestrial <i>Prana</i>. The periodical
        currents of the finer forces of nature that are in the earth
        pass according to the same laws in the principle of life; just
        like the Zodiac, the <i>prana mayakosha</i> is subdivided into
        mansions, etc. The northern and southern inclinations of the
        axis give us a heart and a brain. Each of these has 12
        ramifications branching off from it; these are the 12 signs of
        the Zodiac. The daily rotation than gives us the 31 chakras
        spoken of previously. There is the positive semi-mansion and the
        negative semi-mansion. Then we have the one-third, the
        one-ninth, the one-twelfth, and so on to a degree, or the
        divisions and subdivisions thereof. Each <i>chakra</i>, both
        diurnal and annual, is in fact a circle of 360 degrees, just
        like the great circles of the heavenly spheres. Through the <i>chakra</i>
        a course of seven descriptions of life-currents is established:
      </p>
      <p>(1) Solar, (2) lunar, (3) Mars, <i>agni</i>, (4) Mercury, <i>prithivi</i>,
        (5) Jupiter, <i>vayu</i>, (6) Venus, <i>apas</i>, (7) Saturn,
        <i>akasa</i>. </p>
      <p>It is quite possible that along the same <i>chakra</i> there
        may be passing all or any one or more of these differing
        currents at one and the same time. The reader is reminded of the
        telegraph currents of modern electricity. It is evident that the
        real state of <i>prana</i> is determined by the position of
        these localized currents. Now if any one or more of these tatwic
        currents is strengthened by any act of ours, under any position
        of the currents, it is only when we have to a degree the same
        position of the currents that the tatwic current will makes it
        appearance at full strength. There may also be appearances of
        slight power at various times, but the full strength will never
        be exhausted until we have the same position of these currents
        to the minutest division of a degree. This takes ages upon ages,
        and it is quite impossible that the effect should pass off in
        the present life. Hence rises the necessity of a second life
        upon this earth. </p>
      <p>The accumulated tatwic effects of a life’s work give each life
        a general tinge of its own. This tinge wears off gradually as
        the component colors pass off or weaken in strength, one by one.
        When each of the component colors is one by one sufficiently
        worn off, the general color of a life passes off. The gross body
        that was given birth to by this particular color ceases to
        respond to the now generally different colored <i>prana</i>.
        The <i>prana</i> does not pass out of the <i>susumna</i>.
        Death is the result. </p>
      <p><b>Death ~</b> </p>
      <p>As already said, the two ordinary forms of death are the
        positive through the brain, and the negative through the heart.
        This is death through the <i>susumna</i>. In this all the
        tatwas are potential. Death may also take place through the
        other nadis. In this case there must always be the prevalence of
        one or more <i>tatwas</i>. </p>
      <p>The <i>prana</i> goes towards different regions after death,
        according to the paths through which it passes out of the body.
        Thus: </p>
      <p>(1) The negative <i>susumna</i> takes it to the moon; (2) the
        positive <i>susumna</i> takes it to the sun; (3) the <i>agni</i>
        of the other <i>nadi</i> takes it to the hill known as <i>Raurava</i>
        (fire); (4) the <i>apas</i> of the other <i>nadi</i> takes it
        to the hill known as <i>Ambarisha</i>, and so on, the <i>akasa</i>,
        the <i>vayu</i>, and the <i>prithivi</i> take it to <i>Andhatanusra</i>,
        <i>Kalasutra</i>, and <i>Maha kala</i> (See <i>Yoga Sutra</i>,
        <i>pada</i> 111, Aphorism 26, commentary). </p>
      <p>The negative path is the most general one that the <i>prana</i>
        takes. This path takes it to the moon (the <i>chandraloka</i>)
        because the moon is the lord of the negative system, and the
        negative currents, and the negative <i>susumna</i> the heart,
        which therefore is a continuation of the lunar <i>prana</i>.
        The <i>prana</i> that has the general negative color cannot
        move but along this path, and it is transferred naturally to the
        reservoirs, the centers of the negative <i>prana</i>. Those men
        in whom the two hours’ lunar current is passing more or less
        regularly take this path. </p>
      <p>The <i>prana</i> that has lost the intensity of its
        terrestrial color energizes lunar matter according to its own
        strength, and thus establishes for itself there a sort of
        passive life. Here the mind is in a state of dream. The tatwic
        impressions of gathered up forces pass before it in the same way
        as they pass before it in our earthly dreams. The only
        difference is that in that state there is not the superimposed
        force of indigestion to render the tatwic impressions so strong
        and sudden as to be terrible. That dreamy state is characterized
        by extreme calmness. Whatever our mind has in it of the
        interesting experiences of this world, whatever we have thought,
        heard, seen or enjoyed, the sense of satisfaction and enjoyment,
        the bliss and playfulness of the <i>apas</i> and the <i>prithivi




          tatwa</i>, the languid sense of love of the <i>agni</i>, the
        agreeable forgetfulness of the <i>akasa</i>, all make their
        appearance one after the other in perfect calm. The painful
        impressions make no appearance, because the painful arises when
        any impression forces itself upon the mind that is out of
        harmony with its surroundings. In this state the mind lives in <i>Chandraloka</i>,
        as will be better understood when I come to speak of the tatwic
        causes of dreams. </p>
      <p>Ages roll on in this state, when the mind has, according to the
        same general laws that obtain for <i>prana</i>, worn out the
        impressions of a former life. The intense tatwic colors that the
        ceaseless activity of <i>prana</i> had called into existence
        now fade away, until at last the mind comes upon a chronic level
        with the <i>prana</i>. Both of them have now lost the tinge of
        a former life. It may be said of <i>prana</i> that it has a new
        appearance, and of the mind that it has a new consciousness.
        When they are both in this state, both very weak, the
        accumulated tatwic effects of <i>prana</i> begin to show
        themselves with the return of the stars to the same positions.
        These draw us back from the lunar to the terrestrial <i>prana</i>.
        At this stage, the mind has no individuality worth taking
        account of, so that it is drawn by <i>prana</i> to wherever its
        affinities carry it. It comes and joins with those solar rays
        that bear a similar color, with all those mighty potentialities
        that show themselves in the future man remaining quite latent.
        It passes with the rays of the sun according to the ordinary
        laws of vegetation into grain that bears similar colors. Each
        grain has a separate individuality, which accounts for its
        separate individuality from others of its brothers, and in many
        there may be human potentialities giving it an individuality of
        its own. The grain or grains produce the virile semen, which
        assumes the shape of human beings in the wombs of women. This is
        rebirth. </p>
      <p>Similarly do human individualities come back from the five
        states that are known as hells. These are the states of
        posthumous existence fixed for those men who enjoy to an
        excessive and violent degree the various impressions of each of
        the tatwas. As the tatwic intensity, which disturbs the balance
        and therefore causes pain, wears off in time, the individual <i>prana</i>
        passes off to the lunar sphere, and thence undergoes the same
        states that have been described above. </p>
      <p>Along the positive path through the <i>brahmarandhra</i> pass
        those <i>prana</i> that pass beyond the general effects of
        Time, and therefore do not return to the earth under ordinary
        laws. It is Time that brings back <i>prana</i> from the moon,
        when he is even the most general, and the least strong tatwic
        condition comes into play with the return of identical astral
        positions; but the sun being the keeper of Time himself, and the
        strongest factor in the determination of his tatwic condition,
        it would be impossible for solar Time to affect solar <i>prana</i>.
        Therefore, only that <i>prana</i> travels towards the sun in
        which there is almost no preponderance of any tatwic color. This
        is the state of the <i>prana</i> of <i>Yogin</i> alone. By the
        constant practice of the eight branches of <i>Yoga</i>, the
        prana is purified of any very strongly personifying colors, and
        since it is evident that on such a <i>prana</i> Time can have
        no effect, under ordinary circumstances, they pass off to the
        sun. These <i>prana</i> have no distinct personifying colors;
        all of them that go to the sun have almost the same general
        tinge. But their minds are different. They can be distinguished
        from each other according to the particular branch of science
        that they have cultivated, or according to the particular and
        varying methods of mental improvement that they have followed on
        earth. In this state the mind is not dependent, as in the moon,
        upon the impressions of <i>prana</i>. Constant practice of <i>Yoga</i>
        has rendered it an independent worker, depending only upon the
        soul, and molding the <i>prana</i> to its own shapes, and
        giving it its own colors. This is a kind of <i>Moksha</i>. </p>
      <p>Although the sun is the most potent lord of life, and the
        tatwic condition of <i>prana</i> now has no effect upon the
        prana that has passed to the sun, the planetary currents still
        have some slight effect upon it, and there are times when this
        effect is very strong, so that the earthly conditions in which
        they have previously lived are called back again to their minds.
        A desire to do the same sort of good they did the world in their
        previous life takes possession of them, and impelled by this
        desire they sometimes come back to earth. Snakaracharya has
        noticed in his commentary of the <i>Brahmasutra</i> that
        Apantaramah, a Vedic <i>rishi</i>, thus appeared on earth as
        Krishna-dwaipayana, about the end of the <i>Dwapara</i> and the
        beginning of the <i>Kaliyuga</i>. </p>
      <p><a name="vi"></a><b><font size="+1">VI. <i>Prana</i> (III) ~</font></b>
      </p>
      <p>As it is desirable that as much as possible should be known
        about <i>Prana</i>, I give below some quotations on the subject
        from the <i>Prasnopnishat</i>. They will give additional
        interest to the subject, and present it in a more comprehensive
        and far more attractive garb. </p>
      <p>Six things are to be known about <i>Prana</i>, says the <i>Upanishad</i>:
      </p>
      <p>"He who knows the birth (1), the coming in (2), the places of
        manifestation (3), the rule (4), the macrocosmic appearance (5),
        and the microcosmic appearance of <i>Prana</i> becomes immortal
        by that knowledge." </p>
      <p>Practical knowledge of the laws of life, i.e., to live up to
        them, must naturally end in the passing of the soul out of the
        shadowy side of life into the original light of the Sun. This
        means immortality, that is, passing beyond the power of
        terrestrial death. </p>
      <p>But to go on with what the <i>Upanishad</i> has to say about
        the six things to be known about <i>Prana</i>: </p>
      <p><b>The Birth of <i>Prana</i> ~</b> </p>
      <p>The <i>Prana</i> is born from the <i>Atma</i>; it is caused
        in the <i>atma</i>, like the shadow in the body. </p>
      <p>The human body, or any other organism, becomes the cause of
        throwing a shade in the ocean of <i>prana</i>, as it comes
        between the sun and the portion of space on the other side of
        the organism. Similarly, the <i>prana</i> is thrown as a shade
        in the macrocosmic soul (<i>Iswara</i>) because the macrocosmic
        mind (<i>manu</i>) intervenes. Briefly the <i>prana</i> is the
        shade of <i>Manu</i> caused by the light of the Logos, the
        macrocosmic center. The suns are given birth to in this shade,
        by the impression of the macrocosmic mental ideas into this
        shade. These suns, the centers of <i>Prana</i>, become in their
        turn the positive starting point of further development. The
        manus throwing their shade by the intervention of the suns, give
        birth in those shades to planets, etc. The suns throwing their
        shades by the intervention of planets, give birth to moons. Then
        these different centers begin to act upon the planets, and the
        sun descends on the planets in the shape of various organisms,
        man included. </p>
      <p><b>The Macrocosmic Appearance ~</b> </p>
      <p>This <i>prana</i> is found in the macrocosm as the ocean of
        life with the sun for its center. It assumes two phases of
        existence: (1) the <i>prana</i>, the solar, positive
        life-matter, and (2) the <i>rayi</i>, the lunar, negative
        life-matter. The former is the northern phase and the eastern;
        the latter is the southern phase and the western. In every
        Moment of Terrestrial life, we have thus the northern and
        southern centers of <i>prana</i>, the centers from which the
        southern and northern phases of life-matter take their start at
        any moment. The eastern and western halves are there too. </p>
      <p>At every moment of time -- i.e., in every <i>truti</i> --
        there are millions of <i>truti</i> -- perfect organisms -- in
        space. This might require some explanation. The units of time
        and space are the same: a <i>truti</i>. </p>
      <p>Take any one <i>truti</i> of time. It is well known that every
        moment of time the tatwic rays of <i>prana</i> go in every
        direction from every point to every other point. Hence it is
        clear enough that every <i>truti</i> of space is a perfect
        picture of the whole apparatus of <i>prana</i>, with all its
        centers and sides, and positive and negative relations. To
        express a good deal in a few words, every <i>truti</i> of space
        is a perfect organism. In the ocean of <i>Prana</i> that
        surrounds the sun there are innumerable such <i>truti</i>. </p>
      <p>While essentially the same, it is easy to understand that the
        following items will make a difference in the general color,
        appearance, and forms of these trutis: (1) distance from the
        solar center; (2) inclination from the solar axis. </p>
      <p>Take the earth for illustration. That zone of solar life,
        taking into consideration both the distance and the inclination
        in which the earth moves, gives birth to earth-life. This zone
        of earth-life is known as the ecliptic. Now every <i>truti</i>
        of space in this ecliptic is a separate individual organism. As
        the earth moves in her annual course, i.e., as the <i>truti</i>
        of time changes, these permanent <i>truti</i> of space change
        the phases of their life. But their permanency is never
        impaired. They retain their individuality all the same. </p>
      <p>All the planetary influences reach these trutis always,
        wherever the planets may be in their journey. The changing
        distance and inclination is, of course, always causing a change
        of life-phase. </p>
      <p>This <i>truti</i> of space, from its permanent position in the
        ecliptic, while maintaining its connection with all the planets,
        at the same time sends its tatwic rays to every other quarter of
        space. They also come to the earth. </p>
      <p>It is a condition of earth life that the positive and negative
        currents, the <i>prana</i> and the <i>rayi</i>, be equally
        balanced. Therefore, when the two phases of life matter are
        equally strong in this ecliptical <i>truti</i>, the tatwic rays
        that come from it to the earth energize gross matter there. The
        moment that the balance is disturbed by the tatwic influence of
        the planets, or by some other cause, terrestrial death ensues.
        This simply means that the tatwic rays of the <i>truti</i> that
        fall on earth cease to energize gross matter, although they do
        fall there all the same, and although the <i>truti</i> is there
        all the same in its permanent ecliptical abode. In this
        posthumous state, the human <i>truti</i> will energize gross
        matter in that quarter of space whose laws of relative, negative
        and positive predominance coincide with that state. Thus, when
        the negative life matter, the <i>rayi</i>, becomes overly
        strong, the energization of the <i>truti</i> is transferred
        from the earth to the moon. Similarly it may pass to other
        spheres. When the terrestrial balance is restored again, when
        this posthumous life has been lived, the energization is
        transferred to the earth again. </p>
      <p>Such is the macrocosmic appearance of <i>Prana</i>, with the
        pictures of all the organisms of the earth. </p>
      <p><b>The Coming In Of <i>Prana</i> ~</b> </p>
      <p>How does this <i>prana maya kosha</i> -- this <i>truti</i> of
        the macrocosm -- come into this body? Briefly, "By actions at
        whose root lies the mind", says the <i>Upanishad</i>. It was
        explained previously how every action changes the nature of the
        <i>prana maya kosha</i>, and it will be explained in the essay
        on the "Cosmic Picture Gallery" how these changes are
        represented in the cosmical counterpart of our life-principle.
        It is evident that by these actions change is produced in the
        general relative nature of the <i>prana</i> and the <i>rayi</i>,
        which has been spoken of previously. It is hardly necessary to
        say that the mind -- the human free will -- lies at the root of
        those actions that disturb the tatwic balance of the
        life-principle. Hence, "The <i>prana</i> comes into this body
        by actions, at whose root lies the mind." </p>
      <p><b>The Places of Manifestation ~</b> </p>
      <p>"As the paramount Power appoints its servants, telling, ‘Rule
        such and such villages’, so does the <i>Prana</i>. It puts its
        different manifestations in different places. The <i>apana</i>
        (this discharges faces and urine) is in the <i>Payu</i> (anus)
        and the <i>upastha</i>. The manifestations known as sight and
        hearing (<i>Chakahus</i> and <i>Srotra</i>) are in the eye and
        ear. The <i>prana</i> remains itself, going out of mouth and
        nose. Between (the places of <i>prana</i> and <i>apana</i>,
        about the navel) lives the <i>Samana</i>. It is this that
        carries equally (all over the body) the food (and drink) that is
        thrown in the fire. Hence are those seven lights (by means of <i>prana,</i>
        light of knowledge is thrown over color, form, sound, etc.) </p>
      <p>"In the heart is of course this <i>atma</i> (the <i>pranamaya
          kosha</i>) and in it, of course, the other coils. Here there
        are a hundred and one <i>nadi</i>. Of these there are a hundred
        in each. In each of these branch nadis there are 72,000 other <i>nadi</i>.
        In these moves the <i>vyana</i>. </p>
      <p>"By one (the <i>Susumna</i>) going upward, the udana carries
        to good worlds by means of goodness, and to bad ones by means of
        evil; by both to the world of men. </p>
      <p>"The sun is, of course, the macrocosmic <i>prana</i>; he
        rises, and thereby helps the eyesight. The Power that is in the
        earth keeps up the power of <i>apana</i>. The <i>akasa</i>
        (the ethereal matter) that is between heaven and earth, helps
        the <i>samana</i>. </p>
      <p>"The ethereal life-matter (independent of its being between
        heaven and earth) which fills macrocosmic space, is <i>vyana</i>.
      </p>
      <p>"The <i>taijas</i> -- the luminiferous ether -- is <i>udana</i>;
        hence he whose natural fire is cooled down approaches death. </p>
      <p>"Then the man goes toward the second birth; the organs and
        senses go into the mind; the mind of the man comes to the <i>Prana</i>
        (its manifestations now ceasing). The <i>prana</i> is combined
        with the <i>taijas</i>; going with the soul, it carries her to
        the spheres that are in view." </p>
      <p>The different manifestations of <i>Prana</i> in the body, and
        the places where they manifest themselves have been dwelt upon.
        But other statements of interest appear in this extract. It is
        said that this <i>atma</i>, this <i>prana maya kosha</i>, with
        the other coils of course, is located in the heart. The heart,
        as has been seen, represents the negative side of life, the
        rayi. When the positive <i>prana</i> impresses itself upon the
        <i>rayi</i> -- the heart and the nadis that flow from it -- the
        forms of life and the actions of man come into existence. It is
        therefore, properly speaking, the reflection in the heart that
        works in the world, i.e., is the proper lord of the sensuous and
        active organs of life. If this being of the heart learns not to
        live here, the sensuous and active organs both lose their life;
        the connection with the world ceases. The being of the brain
        that has no immediate connection with the world, except through
        the heart, now remains in unrestrained purity. This means to say
        that the soul goes to the <i>suryaloka</i> (the Sun). </p>
      <p>The next point of interest is the description of the functions
        of the External <i>Prana</i>, which lie at the root of, and
        help the working of the individualized <i>prana</i>. It is said
        that the Sun is the <i>Prana</i>. This is evident enough, and
        has been mentioned man times before this. Here it is meant to
        say that the most important function of life, inspiration and
        expiration, the function of which, according to the Science of
        Breath, is the One Law of existence in the Universe on all the
        planes of life, is brought into existence and kept in activity
        by the sun in himself. It is the solar breath that constitutes
        his existence, and this reflected in man producing matter gives
        birth to human breath. </p>
      <p>The Sun then appears in another phase. He rises, and as he
        does, he supports the eyes in their natural action. </p>
      <p>Similarly, the power that is in the earth sustains the <i>apana</i>
        manifestation of <i>prana</i>. It is the power that draws
        everything towards the earth, says the commentator. In modern
        language, it is gravity. </p>
      <p>Something more might be said here about the <i>udana</i>
        manifestation of <i>prana</i>. As everybody knows, there is a
        phase of microcosmic <i>prana</i> that carries everything,
        names, forms, sight, sounds, and all other sensations, from one
        place to another. This is otherwise known as the universal <i>agni</i>,
        or the <i>Tejas</i> of the text. The localized manifestation of
        <i>Prana</i> is called <i>udana</i>, that which carries the
        life-principle from one place to another. The particular
        destination is determined by past actions, and this universal
        agni carries the <i>prana</i>, with the soul, to different
        worlds. </p>
      <p><a name="vii"></a><b><font size="+1">VII. <i>Prana</i> (IV) ~</font></b>
      </p>
      <p>This <i>Prana</i> is then a mighty being, and if its localized
        manifestations were to work in unison, and with temperance,
        doing their own duty, but not usurping the time and place of
        others, there would be but little evil in the world. </p>
      <p>But each of these manifestations asserts its sole power over
        the bewildered human soul. Each of these claims the whole life
        of man to be its own proper domain: </p>
      <p>"The <i>akasa</i>, the <i>vayu</i>, the <i>agni</i>, the <i>prithivi</i>,
        the <i>apas</i>, speech, sight and hearing -- all of them say
        clearly that they are the sole monarchs of the human body." </p>
      <p>The principal <i>prana</i>, he whose manifestations all these
        are, tells them: </p>
      <p>"Be not forgetful; it is I who sustain the human body, dividing
        myself into five." </p>
      <p>If the five manifestations of <i>Prana</i> with all their
        minor subdivisions revolt against him, if each begin to assert
        its own lordship and cease to work for the general benefit of
        the lord paramount, the real life, misery makes its sad
        appearance to harass the poor human soul. "But the manifestation
        of <i>prana</i>, blinded by ignorance," would not "put forth"
        in the admonitions of their lord. "He leaves the body, and as he
        leaves, all the other minor pranas leave it too; they stay there
        as he stays." Then their eyes are opened. "As the bees follow
        the queen bee in every posture, so does <i>prana</i>; these,
        speech, the mind, the eye, the ear, follow him with devotion,
        and thus praise him." </p>
      <p>"He is the <i>agni</i>, the cause of heat; he is the sun (the
        giver of light); he is the cloud, he is the <i>Indra</i>, he is
        the <i>Vayu</i>, he is the <i>prithivi</i>, he is the <i>rayi</i>,
        and the <i>deva</i>, the <i>sat</i>, and the <i>asat</i>, and
        he is the immortal. </p>
      <p>[<i>Rayi</i> and <i>asat</i> are the negative, <i>deva</i>
        and <i>sat</i> the positive phases of life-matter.] </p>
      <p>"Like the spokes in the nave of a wheel, everything is
        sustained in <i>prana</i>: the hymns of the <i>Rik</i>, the <i>Yajur</i>,
        and the <i>Sama Veda</i>, the sacrifice, the <i>Kshatriya</i>,
        and the <i>Brahmin</i>, etc. </p>
      <p>"Thou art the Progenitor; thou movest in the womb; thou art
        born in the shape of the father or the mother; to thee, O <i>Prana</i>,
        that puts up in the body with thy manifestations, these
        creatures offer presents. </p>
      <p>"Thou art the carrier of offerings to the <i>deva</i>, thou
        art the carrier of oblations to the fathers; thou art the action
        and the power of the senses and other manifestations of life. </p>
      <p>"Thou art, O <i>Prana</i>, in power the great lord, the <i>Rudra</i>
        [the destroyer] and the Preserver; thou movest in the sky as the
        sun, thou art the preserver of the light of heaven. </p>
      <p>"When thou rainest, these creatures are full of joy because
        they hope to have plenty of food. </p>
      <p>"Thou art <i>Prana</i>, pure by nature; thou art the consumer
        of all oblations, as the <i>Ekarshi</i> fire [of the <i>Atharva</i>;
        thou art the preserver of all existence; we are to thee the
        offerers of food; thou art our father as the Recorder [or, the
        Life-giver of the Recorder]. </p>
      <p>"Make healthy that appearance of thine which is located in the
        speech, the ear, the eye, and that which is stretched towards
        the mind; do not fly away. </p>
      <p>"Whatever exists in the three heavens, all of it is in the
        power of <i>prana</i>. Protect us like a mother her offspring;
        give us wealth and intellect." </p>
      <p>With this I conclude my description of <i>Prana</i>, the
        second principle of the Universe, and the human body. The
        epithets bestowed upon this mighty being in the above extract
        will be easy of understanding in the light of all that has gone
        before. It is now time to trace the working of the universal
        Tatwic Law of Breath on the next higher pane of life, the mind (<i>manomayakosha</i>).

      <p><a name="viii"></a><b><font size="+1">VIII. The Mind (I) ~</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Introduction~</b> </p>
      <p>No theory of the life of the Universe is at once so simple and
        so grand as the theory of breath (<i>Swara</i>). It is the one
        universal motion, which makes its appearance in <i>maya</i> by
        virtue of the unseen substratum of the Cosmos, the <i>parabrahma</i>
        of the Vedantins. The most appropriate expression for <i>Swara</i>
        in English is the "current of life". The Indian Science of
        Breath investigates and formulates the laws, or rather the one
        Universal Law, according to which this current of life, this
        motive power of Universal Intelligence, running (as Emerson so
        beautifully puts it) along the wire of thought, governs
        evolution and involution and all the phenomena of human life,
        physiological, mental and spiritual. In the whole length and
        breadth of this universe there is no phenomenon, great or small,
        that does not find its most natural, most intelligible, most
        apposite explanation in the theory of the five modes of
        manifestation of this universal motion: the five elementary <i>tatwas</i>.
        In the foregoing essays I have tried to explain generally how
        every physiological phenomenon was governed by the five <i>tatwas</i>.
        The object of the present essay is to briefly run over the
        various phenomena relating to the third higher body of man --
        the <i>manomaya kosha</i>, the mind -- and note how
        symmetrically and universally the <i>tatwas</i> bring about the
        formation and work of this principle. </p>
      <p><b>Knowledge ~</b> </p>
      <p>It is what is in general language called knowledge that
        distinguishes the mind from physiological life (<i>prana</i>),
        but it will be seen on a little consideration that different
        degrees of knowledge might very well be taken as the
        distinguishing characteristics of the five states of matter,
        which in man we call the five principles. For what is knowledge
        but a kind of tatwic motion of breath, elevated into
        self-consciousness by the presence, in a greater or lesser
        degree, of the element of <i>ahankara</i> (egoism)? His is no
        doubt the view taken of knowledge by the Vedantic philosopher
        when he speaks of intelligence as being the motive power, the
        first cause of the universe. The word <i>swara</i> is only a
        synonym of intelligence, the one manifestation of the One
        descending into <i>prakriti</i>. </p>
      <p>"I see something" means, according to our view of knowledge,
        that my <i>manomaya kosha</i> has been put into visual
        vibration. "I hear" means that my mind is in a state of auditory
        vibration."I feel" means that my mind is in a state of tangible
        vibration. And so on with the other senses. "I love" means that
        my mind is in a state of amatory vibration (a form of
        attraction). </p>
      <p>The first state, that of the <i>anandamaya</i>, is the state
        of the highest knowledge. There is then but one center, the
        substratum for the whole infinity of <i>parabrahma</i>, and the
        ethereal vibrations of his breath are one throughout the whole
        expanse of infinity. There is but one intelligence, but one
        knowledge. The whole universe with all its potentialities and
        actualities is a part of that knowledge. This is the highest
        state of bliss. There is no consciousness of self here, for the
        I has only a relative existence, and there must be a Thou or a
        He before there can be an I. </p>
      <p>The ego takes form when, in the second plane of existence, more
        than one minor center comes into existence. It is for this
        reason that the name <i>ahankara</i> has been given to this
        state of matter. The ethereal impulses of those centers are
        confined to their own particular domain in space, and they
        differ in each center. They can, however, affect each other in
        just the same way as the individualized ethereal impulses of one
        man are affected by those of others. The tatwic motion of one
        center of <i>Brahma</i> is carried along the same universal
        lines to the other. Two differing motions are thus found in one
        center. The stronger impulse is called the I, the weaker the
        Thou or the He as the case may be. </p>
      <p>Then comes <i>manas</i>. <i>Viraj</i> is the center, and <i>manu</i>
        the atmosphere of this state. These centers are beyond the ken
        of ordinary humanity, but they work under laws similar to those
        ruling the rest of the cosmos. The suns move the <i>virats</i>
        in the same way as the planets move around the sun. </p>
      <p><b>The Functions of the Mind ~</b> </p>
      <p>The composition of the <i>manu</i> is similar to that of <i>prana</i>:
        it is composed of a still finer grade of the five <i>tatwas</i>,
        and this increased fineness endows the tatwas with different
        functions. </p>
      <p>The five functions of <i>prana</i> have been given. The
        following are the five functions of <i>manas</i>, as given by
        Patanjali and accepted by Vyasa: </p>
      <p>(1) Means of knowledge (<i>Pramana</i>), (2) False knowledge (<i>Viparyaya</i>),
(3)




        Complex imagination (<i>Vikalpa</i>), (4) Sleep (<i>Nidra</i>),
        (5) Memory (<i>Smrite</i>). </p>
      <p>All the manifestation of the mind fall under one or another of
        these five heads. Thus, <i>Pramana</i> includes: </p>
      <p>(1) Perception (<i>pratyaksha</i>), (2) Inference (<i>anumana</i>),
(3)




        Authority (<i>Agama</i>). </p>
      <p><i>Viparyana</i> includes: </p>
      <p>(1) Ignorance (<i>avidya, tamas</i>), (2) Egoism (<i>asinita,
          moha</i>), (3) Retention (<i>raja, mahamoka</i>), (4)
        Repulsion (<i>tamisra, dwesha</i>), (5) Tenacity of life (<i>abhinwesha,



          andhatamisra</i>). </p>
      <p>The remaining three have no definite subdivisions. Now I shall
        show that all the modifications of thought are forms of tatwic
        motion on the mental plane. </p>
      <p><b><i>Pramana</i> (Means of Knowledge) ~</b> </p>
      <p>The word <i>pramana</i> (means of knowledge) is derived from
        two roots, the predicative <i>ma</i>, and the derivative root <i>ana</i>,
        with the prefix <i>pra</i>. The original idea of the root <i>ma</i>
        is "to go", "to move", and hence "to measure". The Prefix <i>pra</i>
        gives the root idea of fullness, connected as it is with the
        root <i>pri</i>, to fill. That which moves exactly up or down
        to the same height with any other thing is the <i>pramana</i>
        of that thing. In becoming the <i>pramana</i> of any other
        thing, the first thing assumes certain qualities that it did not
        have before. This is always brought about by a change of state
        caused by a certain kind of motion, for it is always motion that
        causes change of state. In fact, this is also the exact meaning
        of the word pramana, as applied to a particular manifestation of
        the mind. </p>
      <p><i>Pramana</i> is a particular tatwic motion of the mental
        body; its effect is to put the mental body into a state similar
        to that of something else. The mind can undergo as many changes
        as the external tatwas are capable of imprinting upon it, and
        these changes have been classified into three general heads by
        Patanjali. </p>
      <p><b><i>Pratyaksha</i> (Perception) ~</b> </p>
      <p>This is that change of state which the operations of the five
        sensuous organs produce in the mind. The word is a compound of
        "I", each, and "<i>aksha</i>", sensuous power, organ of sense.
        Hence is that sympathetic tatwic vibration that an organ of
        sense in contact with its object produces in the mind. These
        changes can be classified under five heads, according to the
        number of the senses. </p>
      <p>The eye gives birth to the <i>taijas</i> vibrations, the
        tongue, the skin, the ear, and the nose respectively to the <i>apas</i>,
        the <i>vayu</i>, the <i>akasa</i> and the <i>prithivi</i>
        vibrations. The pure <i>agni</i> causes the perception of red,
        the <i>taijas-prithivi</i> of yellow, the <i>taijas-apas</i>
        of white, the <i>taijas-vayu</i> of blue, and so on. Other
        colors are produced in the mind by mixed vibrations in a
        thousand varying degrees. The <i>apas</i> gives softness, the <i>vayu</i>
        roughness, the <i>agni</i> harshness. We see through the eyes
        not only color, but also form. It will be remembered that a
        particular form has been assigned to every tatwic vibration, and
        all the forms of gross matter answer to corresponding tatwic
        vibrations. Thus, form can be perceived through every sense. The
        eyes can see form, the tongue can taste it, the skin can touch
        it, and so on. This may probably appear to be a novel assertion,
        but it must be remembered that virtue is not an act. The ear
        would hear form, if the more general use of the eye and skin for
        this purpose had not almost stifled it into inaction. </p>
      <p>The pure <i>apas</i> vibrations cause an astringent taste, the
        <i>apas-prithivi</i> a sweet, the <i>apas-agni</i> hot, the <i>apas-vayu</i>
        acid, and so on. Innumerable other vibrations of taste are
        caused by intermediate vibrations in various degrees. </p>
      <p>The case is similar with the vocal and other changes of
        vibration. It is clear that our perceptive knowledge is nothing
        more than a veritable tatwic motion of the mental body, caused
        by the sympathetic communications of the vibrations of <i>prana</i>,
        just as a stringed instrument of a certain tension begins to
        vibrate spontaneously when vibration is set up in another
        similar instrument. </p>
      <p><b><i>Anumana</i> (Inference) ~</b> </p>
      <p>The word <i>anumana</i> has the same roots as the word <i>pramana</i>.
        The only difference is in the prefix. We have here <i>anu</i>,
        "after", instead of <i>pra</i>. Inference (anumana) is
        therefore after-motion. When the mind is capable of sustaining
        two vibrations at one and the same time, then if any one of
        these vibrations is set up and perceived, the second vibration
        must also manifest itself. Thus, suppose a man pinches me. The
        complex vibrations that make up the perception of the action of
        man pinching me are produced in my mind. I recognize the
        phenomena. Almost simultaneously with these vibrations another
        set of vibrations is produced in me. I call this pain. Now here
        are two kinds of tatwic motion, one coming after the other. If
        at any other time I feel similar pain, the image of the man
        pinching will be recalled to my consciousness. This after-motion
        is "inference". Induction and deduction are both modifications
        of this after-motion. The sun always appears to rise in a
        certain direction. The concept of that direction becomes forever
        associated in my mind with the rising of the sun. Whenever I
        think of the phenomenon of sunrise, the concept of that
        direction presents itself. Therefore I say that, as a rule, the
        sun rises in that direction. Inference is therefore nothing more
        than a tatwic motion coming after another related one. </p>
      <p><b><i>Agama</i> (Authority) ~</b> </p>
      <p>The third modification of what is called the means of knowledge
        (<i>pramana</i>) is authority (<i>agama</i>). What is this? I
        read in my geography, or hear from the lips of my teacher that
        Britain is surrounded by the ocean. Now what has connected these
        words in my mind with the picture of Britain, the ocean, and
        their mutual relations? Certainly it is not perception, and
        therefore not inference, which must by nature work through
        sensuous knowledge. What then? There must be some third
        modification. </p>
      <p>The fact that words possess the power to raise a certain
        picture in our minds is one of very deep interest. Every Indian
        philosopher recognizes it as a third modification of the mind,
        but it receives no recognition at the hands of modern European
        philosophy. </p>
      <p>There is, however, little doubt that the color corresponding to
        this mental modification differs from that corresponding to
        either perception or inference. The color belonging the
        perceptive modifications of the mind is always single in nature.
        A certain phase of the <i>taijas</i> vibration must always
        prevail in the visual modification, and similarly the vibrations
        of other tatwas correspond to our different sensuous
        modifications. Each manifestation has its own distinctive color.
        The red will appear as well in the visual as in the auditory or
        any other vibration, but the red of the visual will be bright
        and pure; that of the organ of smell will be tinged with yellow;
        that of the organ of touch with blue, and the soniferous ether
        will be rather dark. There is, therefore, not the least
        likelihood that the vocal vibration will coincide with the pure
        perceptive vibration. The coal vibrations are double in their
        nature, and they can only (if at all) coincide with the
        inferential vibrations; and here, too, they can only coincide
        with the auditory vibrations. A little consideration will,
        however, show that there is some difference between the vocal
        and inferential vibrations. In inference, a certain modification
        of sound in our mind is followed by a certain visual picture,
        and both these vibrations retain an equally important position
        in our mind. We place two precepts together, compare them, and
        then say that one follows the other. In the verbal modification
        there is no comparison, no simultaneous consciousness, no
        placing together of the two precepts. The one causes the other,
        but we are not at all conscious of the fact. In inference the
        simultaneous presence for some time of both the cause and the
        effect brings about a change in the color of the effect. The
        difference is less great in the vocal as compared with the
        inferential vibration. Axiomatic knowledge is not inferential in
        the present, tough it has no doubt been so in the past; in the
        present it has become native to the mind. </p>
      <p><b><i>Viparyaya</i> (False Knowledge) ~</b> </p>
      <p>This is the second mental modification. This word also is
        derived from a root meaning motion : <i>i</i> or <i>ay</i>.
        "to go", "to move". The prefix <i>pari</i> is connected with
        the root <i>pra</i>, and gives the same radical meaning as <i>pramana</i>.
        The word <i>Paryaya</i> has the same radical meaning as <i>pramana</i>.
        The word Viparyaya therefore means "a motion removed from the
        motion that coincides with the object". The vibrations of <i>pramana</i>
        coincide in nature with the vibrations of <i>viparyaya</i>.
        Certain acquired conditions of the mind imprint on the precepts
        a new color of their own, and thus distinguish them from the
        precepts of <i>pramana</i>. There are five modifications of
        this manifestation. </p>
      <p><b><i>Avidya</i> (Ignorance) ~</b> </p>
      <p>This is the general field for the manifestation of all the
        modifications of false knowledge. The word comes from the root <i>vid</i>,
        "to know", the prefix <i>a</i>, and the suffix <i>ya</i>. The
        original meaning of the <i>vidya</i> is, therefore, "the state
        of a thing as it is", or expressed in terms of the mental plane
        in one word, "knowledge". As long as in the face of a human
        being I see a face and nothing else, my mental vibration is said
        to be <i>vidya</i>. But as soon as I see a moon or something
        else not a face, when it is a face I am looking at, my mental
        vibration is no longer said to be <i>vidya</i>, but <i>avidya</i>.
        <i>Avidya</i> (ignorance) is therefore not a negative
        conception; it is just as positive as <i>vidya</i> itself. It
        is a great mistake to suppose that words having the privative
        prefixes always imply abstractions and never realities. This,
        however, is by the bye. The state of <i>avidya</i> is that
        state in which the mental vibration is disturbed by that of <i>akasa</i>,
        and some other <i>tatwas</i>, which thus result in the
        production of false appearances. The general appearance of <i>avidya</i>
        is <i>akasa</i>, darkness, and this is why tamas is a synonym
        of this word. </p>
      <p>This general prevalence of darkness is caused by some defect in
        individual minds, because, as we find from daily experience, a
        given object does not excite the same set of vibrations in all
        minds. What, then is the mental defect? It is to be found in the
        nature of the stored-up potential energy of the mind. This
        storing-up of potential energy is a problem of the deepest
        importance in philosophy, and the doctrine of transmigration of
        souls finds its most intelligible explanation in this. The law
        might be enunciated as follows: </p>
      <p><b>The Law of <i>Vasana</i> ~</b> </p>
      <p>If anything be set in any particular kind of tatwic motion,
        internal or external, it acquires for a second time the
        capability of easily being set in motion, and of consequently
        resisting a different sort of motion. If the thing is subjected
        to the same motion for some time, the motion becomes a necessary
        attribute of the thing. The superposed motion becomes, so to
        speak, "second nature". </p>
      <p>Thus, if a man accustoms his body to a particular form of
        exercise, certain muscles in his body are very easily set into
        motion. Any other form of exercise that requires the use of
        other muscles will be found fatiguing on account of the
        resistance set up by muscular habits. The case is similar with
        the mind. If I have a deep-rooted conviction, as some do to this
        day, that the earth is flat and the sun moves around it, it may
        require ages to dislodge it. A thousand examples might be cited
        of such phenomena. It is, however, only necessary in this place
        to state that the capacity of turning easily to one mental state
        and offering resistance to another one is what I mean by this
        stored-up energy. It is variously called <i>vasana</i> or <i>Sansakara</i>
        in Sanskrit. </p>
      <p>The word <i>vasana</i> comes from the root <i>vas</i>, "to
        dwell". It means the dwelling or fixing of some form of
        vibratory motion in the mind. It is by <i>vasana</i> that
        certain truths become native to the mind, and not only certain
        so-called truths, but all the so-called natural tendencies,
        moral, physical, spiritual, become in this way native to the
        mind. The only difference in different <i>vasana</i> is their
        respective stability. The <i>vasana</i> that are imprinted upon
        the mind as the result of the ordinary evolutionary course of
        nature never change. The products of independent human actions
        are of two kinds. If actions result in tendencies that check the
        evolutionary progressive tide of nature, the effect of the
        action exhausts itself in time by the repellant force of the
        undercurrent of evolution. If, however, the two coincide in
        direction, increased strength is the result. The latter sort of
        actions we call virtuous, the former vicious. </p>
      <p>It is this <i>vasana</i>, this temporary dominion of the
        opposite current, that causes false knowledge. Suppose the
        positive generative current has in any man the strength <i>a</i>,
        if too it is presented a negative female current of the same
        degree of strength <i>a</i>, the two will try to unite. An
        attraction that we term sexual love will then be set up. If
        these two currents are not allowed to unite, they increase in
        strength and react on the body itself to its injury; if allowed
        to unite, they exhaust themselves. This exhaustion causes a
        relief to the mind, the progressive evolutionary current asserts
        itself with greater force, and thus a feeling of satisfaction is
        the result. This tatwic disturbance of the mind will, as long as
        it has sufficient strength, give its own color to all
        perceptions and concepts. They will not appear in their true
        light, but as causes of satisfaction. Thus they say that true
        lovers see all things rose-colored. The appearance of a face we
        love to see causes a partial running of currents into one
        another, and a certain amount of satisfaction is the result. We
        forge that we are seeing a face: we are only conscious of some
        cause resulting in a state of satisfaction. That cause of
        satisfaction we call by different names. Sometimes we call it a
        flower, at others we call it a moon. Sometimes we feel that the
        current of life is flowing from those dear eyes, at others we
        recognize nectar itself in that dear embrace. Such are the
        manifestations of <i>avidya</i>. As Patanjali says, <i>avidya</i>
        consists in the perception of the eternal, the pure, the
        pleasing, and the spiritual instead of or rather in the
        non-eternal, the impure, the painful, and the non-spiritual.
        Such is the genesis of <i>avidya</i>, which, as has been
        remarked, is a substantial rality, and not a mere negative
        conception. </p>
      <p>This mental phenomenon causes the four remaining ones. </p>
      <p><b><i>Asmita</i> (Egoism) ~</b> </p>
      <p>Egoism (<i>Asmita</i>) is the conviction that real life
        (purusha swara) is one with the various mental and physiological
        modifications, that the higher self is one with the lower one,
        that the sum of our percepts and concepts is the real ego, and
        that there is nothing beyond. In the present cycle of evolution
        and in the previous ones, the mind has been chiefly occupied
        with these percepts and concepts. The real power of life is
        never seen making any separate appearance, hence the feeling
        that the ego must be the same with the mental phenomena. It is
        plain that <i>avidya</i>, as defined above, lies at the root of
        this manifestation. </p>
      <p><b><i>Raga</i> (Desire to Retain) ~</b> </p>
      <p>The misleading feeling of satisfaction above mentioned under
        avidya is the cause of this condition. When any object
        repeatedly produces in our mind this feeling of satisfaction,
        our mind engenders the habit of falling again and again into the
        same state of tatwic vibration. The feeling of satisfaction and
        the picture of the object that seemed to cause that satisfaction
        tend to appear together, and this is a hankering after the
        object, a desire not to let it escape us -- that is to say, <i>Raga</i>.
      </p>
      <p><b>Pleasure ~</b> </p>
      <p>Here may investigate more thoroughly the nature of this feeling
        of satisfaction and its opposite: pleasure and pain. The
        Sanskrit words for these two mental states are respectively <i>sukha</i>
        and <i>dukkha</i>. Both come from the root <i>khan</i>, "to
        dig"; the prefixes <i>su</i> and <i>dus</i> make the
        difference. The former prefix conveys the idea of "ease" and it
        derives this idea from the unrestrained easy flow of breath. The
        radical idea of <i>sukha</i> is, therefore, unrestrained
        digging -- digging where the soil offers but little resistance.
        Transferred to the mind, that act becomes <i>sukha</i>, which
        makes an easy impression upon it. The act must, in the nature of
        its vibrations, coincide with the then prevailing conditions of
        the mental vibrations. Before any percepts or concepts had taken
        root in the mind, there was no desire, no pleasure. The genesis
        of desire and what is called pleasure -- that is, the sense of
        satisfaction caused by the impressions produced by external
        objects -- begins with certain percepts and concepts taking root
        in the mind. This taking root really is only an overclouding of
        the original set of impressions arising out of evolutionary
        mental progress. When contact with the external object
        momentarily removes that cloud from the clear horizon of the
        mind, the soul is conscious of a feeling of satisfaction that <i>avidya</i>
        connects with the external object. This, as shown above, gives
        birth to desire. </p>
      <p><b>Pain &amp; <i>Dwesha</i> ~</b> </p>
      <p>The genesis of pain and the desire to repel (<i>dwesha</i>) is
        similar. The radical idea of <i>dukkha</i> (pain) is the act of
        digging where a good deal of resistance is experienced.
        Transferred to the mind, it signifies an act that encounters
        resistance from the mind. The mind does not easily give place to
        these vibrations; it tries to repel them with all its might.
        There arises a feeling of privation. It is as if something of
        its nature was being taken away, and an alien phenomenon
        introduced. The consciousness of privation, or want, is pain,
        and the repulsive power that these alien vibrations excite in
        the mind is known by the name of <i>dwesha</i> (desire to
        repel). The word <i>dwesha</i> comes from the root <i>dwesh</i>,
        which is a compound of <i>du</i> and <i>ish</i>. <i>Ish</i>
        itself appears to be a compound root, <i>i</i> and <i>s</i>.
        The final <i>s</i> is connected to the root <i>su</i>, "to
        breath", "to be in one’s natural state". The root <i>i</i>
        means "to go", and the root <i>ish</i>, therefore, means to go
        toward one’s natural state. Transferred to the mind, the word
        becomes a synonym of <i>raga</i>. The word <i>du</i> in <i>dwesh</i>
        performs the same function as <i>dus</i> in <i>dukkh</i>.
        Hence <i>dwesh</i> comes to mean "a hankering after repulsion".
        Anger, jealousy, hatred, etc., are all modifications of this, as
        love, affection and friendship are those of <i>raga</i>. By
        what has been said above, it is easy to follow up the genesis of
        the principle of "tenacity of life". I must now try to assign
        these actions to their prevailing tatwas. </p>
      <p>The general color of <i>avidya</i> is, as already said, that
        of <i>akasa</i>, darkness. Otherwise, the <i>agni tatwa</i>
        prevails in anger. If this is accompanied by <i>vayu</i>, there
        will be a good deal of motion in the body, <i>prithivi</i> will
        make it stubborn, and <i>apas</i> easily manageable. <i>Akasa</i>
        will give a tinge of fear. </p>
      <p>The same <i>tatwa</i> prevails in love. <i>Prithivi</i> makes
        it abiding, <i>vayu</i> changeable, <i>agni</i> fretting, <i>apas</i>
        lukewarm, and <i>akasa</i> blind. </p>
      <p><i>Akasa</i> prevails in fear; it tends to produce a hollow in
        the veins themselves. In <i>prithivi</i> the timid man is
        rooted to the spot, with <i>vayu</i> he runs away, with <i>apas</i>
        he succumbs to flattery, and <i>agni</i> tends to make one
        vengeful. </p>
      <p><b><i>Vikalpa</i> ~</b> </p>
      <p><i>Vikalpa</i> is that knowledge which the words imply or
        signify, but for which there is no reality on the physical
        plane. The sounds of nature connected with its sight have given
        us names for precepts. With the additions or subtractions of the
        percepts we have also had additions and subtractions of the
        sounds connected therewith. The sounds constitute our words. </p>
      <p>In <i>vikalpa</i> two or more precepts are added together in
        such a way as to give birth to a concept having no corresponding
        reality on the physical plane. This is a necessary result of the
        universal law of <i>visana</i>. When the mind is habituated to
        a perception of more phenomena than one, all of them have a
        tendency to appear again; and whenever two or more such
        phenomena coincide in time, we have in our mind a picture of a
        third something. That something may or may not exist in the
        physical plane. If it does not, the phenomenon is <i>vikalpa</i>.
        If it does, however, we call it <i>Samadhi</i>. </p>
      <p><b><i>Nidra</i> (Sleep) ~</b> </p>
      <p>This also is a phenomenon of the <i>manomaya kosha</i> mind.
        Indian philosophers speak of three states in this connection:
        waking, dream, and sleep. </p>
      <p><b>Waking ~</b> </p>
      <p>This is the ordinary state when the principle of life works in
        connection with the mind. The mind then receives impressions of
        the external objects through the action of the senses. The other
        faculties of the mind are purely mental, and they may work in
        the waking as in the dreaming state. The only difference is that
        in dreams the mind does not undergo the perceptive changes. How
        is this? These changes of state are always passive, and the soul
        has no choice in being subjected to them. They come and go as a
        necessary result of the working of <i>swara</i> in all its five
        modifications. As has been explained in the articles on <i>Prana</i>,
        the different sensuous organs cease to respond to external
        tatwic changes when the positive current gains more than
        ordinary strength in the body. The positive force appears to us
        in the shape of heat, the negative in the shape of cold.
        Therefore I may speak of these forces as heat and cold. </p>
      <p><b>Dreams ~</b> </p>
      <p>The <i>Upanishad</i> says that in dreamless sleep the soul
        sleeps in the blood vessels (<i>nadi</i>), the pericardium (<i>puritat</i>),




        the hollow of the heart. Has the system of blood vessels, the
        negative center of <i>Prana</i>, anything to do with dreams
        also? The state of dream, according to the Indian sage, is an
        intermediate one between waking and sleeping, and it is but
        reasonable to suppose that there must be something in this
        system that accounts for both these phenomena. What is that
        something? It is variously spoken of as the <i>pitta</i>, the <i>agni</i>,
        and the sun. It is needless to say that these words are meant to
        denote one and the same thing. It is the effect produced on the
        body by the solar breath in general, and the <i>agni tatwa</i>
        in particular. The word <i>pitta</i> might mislead many, and
        therefore it is necessary to state that the word does not
        necessarily always mean lull. There is one <i>pitta</i> that
        Sanskrit physiology locates specifically in the heart. This is
        called the <i>sadhaka pitta</i>. It is nothing more or less
        than cardiac temperature, and it is with this that we have to do
        in sleep or dream. </p>
      <p>According to the Indian philosopher, it is the cardiac
        temperature that causes the three states in varying degrees.
        This and nothing more is the meaning of the Vedic text that the
        soul sleeps in the pericardium, etc. All the functions of life
        are carried on properly as long as we have a perfect balance of
        the positive and negative currents, heat and cold. The mean of
        the solar and lunar temperatures is the temperature at which the
        <i>prana</i> keeps up its connection with the gross body. The
        mean is struck after an exposure of a whole day and night.
        Within this period the temperature is subjected to two general
        variations. The one is the extreme of the positive; the other
        the extreme of the negative. When the positive reaches its daily
        extreme the sensuous organs pass out of time with the external
        tatwas. </p>
      <p>It is a matter of daily experience that the sensuous organs
        respond to external tatwic vibrations within certain limits. If
        the limit is exceeded either way, the organs become insensible
        to these vibrations. There is, therefore, a certain degree of
        temperature at which the sensuous organs can ordinarily work;
        when this limit is exceed either way, the organs become
        incapable of receiving any impression from without. During day
        the positive life current gathers strength in the heart. The
        ordinary working temperature is naturally exceeded by this
        gathering up of the forces, and the senses sleep. They receive
        no impression from without. This is sufficient to produce the
        dreaming state. As yet the chords of the gross body (<i>sthula
          sharira</i>) alone have slackened, and the soul sees the mind
        no longer affected by external impressions. The mind is,
        however, habituated to various precepts and concepts, and by the
        mere force of habit passes into various states. The breath, as
        it modifies into the five tatwic states, becomes the cause of
        the varying impressions coming up. As already said, the soul has
        no part in calling up these visions of its own free will. It is
        by the working of a necessary law of life that the mind
        undergoes the various changes of the waking and the sleeping
        states. The soul does nothing in conjuring up the phantasms of a
        dream, otherwise it would be impossible to explain horrible
        dreams. Why, indeed, if the soul is entirely free in dreaming
        does it sometimes call into being the hideous appearances that,
        with one terrible shock, seem to send our very blood back to our
        heart? No soul would ever act thus if it could help it. </p>
      <p>The fact is that the impressions of a dream change with the
        tatwas. As one <i>tatwa</i> easily glides into the other, one
        thought gives place to another. The <i>akasa</i> causes fear,
        shame, desire, and anger; the <i>vayu</i> takes us to different
        places; the <i>taijas</i> shows us gold and silver, and the <i>prithivi</i>
        may bring us enjoyment, smiles, dalliance, and so on. And then
        we might have composite tatwic vibrations. We might see men and
        women, dances and battles, councils and popular gatherings; we
        might walk in gardens, smell the choicest flowers, see the most
        beautiful spots; we might shake hands with our friends, we might
        deliver speeches, we might travel into different lands. All
        these impressions are caused by the tatwic state of the mental
        coil, brought about either by (1) physical derangement, (2)
        ordinary tatwic changes, (3) or some other coming natural change
        of state. </p>
      <p>As there are three different causes, there are three different
        kinds of dreams. The first cause is physical derangement. When
        the natural currents of <i>prana</i> are disturbed so that
        disease results, or are about to be so disturbed, the mind in
        the ordinary way undergoes these tatwic changes. The sympathetic
        chords of the minds are excited, and we dream of all the
        disagreeable accompaniments of whatever disease may be within
        our physical atmosphere in store for us. Such dreams are akin in
        their nature to the ravings of delirium; there is only a
        difference in strength and violence. When ill, we may in a
        similar way dream of health and its surroundings. </p>
      <p>The second kind of dream is caused by ordinary tatwic changes.
        When the past, the present, and the future tatwic condition of
        our surroundings is uniform in its nature, when there is no
        change, and when no change is in store for us, the stream of
        dreams is most calm and equable in its easy flow. As the
        atmospheric and the healthful physiological tatwas glide
        smoothly one into the other, so do the impressions of our minds
        in this class of dreams. Ordinarily we cannot even remember
        these dreams, for in them there is nothing of special excitement
        to keep them in our memory. </p>
      <p>The third kind of change is similar to the first; there is only
        a difference in the nature of the effects. These we call the
        effects of disease or health, as the case may be; here we might
        group the results under the general name of prosperity or
        calamity. </p>
      <p>The process of this sort of mental excitement is, however, the
        same in both. The currents of life, pregnant with all sorts of
        good and evil, are sufficient in strength while yet potential
        and only tending towards the actual, to set the sympathetic
        chords of the mind in vibration. The purer the mind, and the
        freer from dust of the world, the more sensitive it is to the
        slightest and the remotes tendency of <i>prana</i> towards some
        change. Consequently we become conscious of coming events in
        dreams. This explains the nature of prophetic dreams. To weigh
        the force of these dreams, however, to find out exactly what
        each dream means, is a most difficult task, and under ordinary
        circumstances quite impossible. We may make 10,000 mistakes at
        ever step, and we need nothing less than a perfect <i>Yogi</i>
        for the right understanding of even our own dreams, to say
        nothing of those of others. Let us explain and illustrate the
        difficulties that surround us in the right understanding of our
        dreams. A man in the same quarter of the city in which I live,
        but unknown to me, is about to die. The tatwic currents of his
        body, pregnant with death, disturb the atmospheric tatwas, and
        through their instrumentality are spread in various degrees all
        over the world. They reach me, too, and excite the sympathetic
        chords of my mind while I am sleeping. There being no special
        room in my mind for that man, my impression will be only
        general. A human being, fair or ugly, male or female, lamented
        or not, and having other similar qualities, will come into the
        mid on his deathbed. But what man? The power of complex
        imagination, unless strongly kept in check by the hardest
        exercise of <i>yoga</i>, will have its play, and it is almost
        certain that a man who has previously been connected in my mind
        with all these tatwic qualities will make his appearance in my
        consciousness. It is evident that I shall be on the wrong track.
        That someone is dead or dying, we may be sure, but who or where
        is impossible for ordinary men to discover. And not only does
        the manifestation of <i>vikalpa</i> put us on the wrong track,
        but all the manifestations of the mind do that. The state of <i>samadhi</i>,
        which is nothing more than putting one’s self into a state of
        the most perfect amenability to tatwic surroundings, is
        therefore impossible unless all the other manifestations are
        held in perfect check. Patanjali says, "<i>Yoga</i> is keeping
        in check the manifestations of the mind." </p>
      <p><b>Sleep ~</b> </p>
      <p>The dreamy state is maintained as long as and when the cardiac
        temperature is not strong enough to affect the mental coil. But
        with increasing positive strength, that too must be affected.
        The <i>manas</i> and the <i>prana</i> are made of the same
        materials and are subject to the same laws. The more subtle
        these materials are, however, the stronger must be the forces
        that produce similar changes. All the coils are tuned together,
        and changes in the one affect the other. The vibrations per
        second of the first one are, however, larger in number than
        those of the lower one, and this causes its subtlety. The higher
        are always affected through the immediately lower principles.
        Thus the external tatwas will affect <i>prana</i> immediately,
        but the mind can only be affected through the <i>prana</i> and
        not directly. The cardiac temperature is only an indication of
        the degree of heat in <i>prana</i>. When sufficient strength is
        gathered up there, the <i>prana</i> affects the mental coil.
        That too now passes out of tune with the soul. The mental
        vibration can only work at a certain temperature; beyond that it
        must go to rest. In this state we have no more dreams. The only
        manifestation of the mind is that of rest. This is the state of
        dreamless sleep. </p>
      <p>I pass on now to the fifth and last mental manifestation. </p>
      <p><b><i>Smrite</i> (Retention, Memory) ~</b> </p>
      <p>As Professor Max Muller has remarked, the original idea at the
        root <i>smri</i> (from which <i>smrite</i>) is "to make soft,
        to melt". The process of making soft or melting consists in the
        melting thing assuming a consistency nearer and nearer to the
        tatwic consistency of the melting force. All change of state is
        equivalent to the assumption on the part of the thing changing,
        of the state of <i>tatwa</i> that causes the change. Hence the
        secondary idea of the root, "to love". Love is that state of
        mind in which it melts into the state of the object of love.
        This change is analogous to the chemical change that gives us a
        photograph on a sensitive plate. As in this phenomenon the
        materials on the sensitive plate are melted into the state of
        the reflected light, so the sensitive plate of the mind melts
        into the state of its percepts. The impression upon the mind is
        deeper, the greater the force of the imprinting rays and the
        greater the sympathy between the mind and the object perceived.
        This sympathy is created by stored up potential energy, and the
        perceptive rays themselves act with greater force when the mind
        is in a sympathetic state. </p>
      <p>Every percept takes root in the mind, as explained above. It is
        nothing more than a change of the tatwic state of the mind, and
        what is left behind is only a capacity for sooner falling into
        the same state again. The mind falls back into the same state
        when it is under the influence of the same tatwic surroundings.
        The presence of the same thing calls back the same mental state.
      </p>
      <p>The tatwic surroundings may be of two descriptions, astral and
        local. The astral influence is the effect upon the individual
        prana of the condition of the terrestrial <i>prana</i> at that
        time. If this effect appears as the <i>agni tatwa</i>, those of
        our concepts that have a prominent connection with this <i>tatwa</i>
        will make their appearance in the mind. Some of these are a
        hankering after wealth, a desire for progeny, etc. If we have
        the <i>vayu tatwa</i>, a desire to travel may take possession
        of our minds and so on. A minute tatwic analysis of all of our
        concepts is of the greatest interest; suffice it to say here
        that the tatwic condition of <i>prana</i> often calls up into
        the mind objects that have made the objects of perception in
        similar previous conditions. It is this power that underlies
        dreams of one class. In the waking state too this phase of
        memory often acts as reminiscence. </p>
      <p>Local surrounding are constituted by those object which the
        mind has been accustomed to perceive together with the immediate
        object of memory. This is the power of association. Both these
        phenomena constitute memory proper (<i>smrite</i>). Here the
        object comes first into the mind, and afterwards the act and the
        surroundings of perception. Another very important kind of
        memory is what is called <i>buddhi</i>, literary memory. This
        is the power by which we call to mind what we have learned of
        scientific facts. The process of storing up these facts in the
        mind is the same, but the coming back into consciousness differs
        in this, that here the act first comes into the mind and then
        the object. All the five tatwas and the foregoing mental
        phenomena may cause the phenomenon of memory. Literary memory
        has a good deal to do with <i>yoga</i>, i.e., the exercise of
        free will to direct the energies of the mind into desirable
        channels. While those impressions that take root in the mind on
        account of natural surroundings make the mind the unwilling
        slave of the external world, <i>buddhi</i> may lead it to bliss
        and freedom. But will these tatwic surroundings always bring
        related phenomena into consciousness? No! This depends upon
        their correlative strength. It is well known that when the
        vibrations per second of <i>akasa</i> (sound) pass beyond a
        certain limit either way, they do not affect the tympanum. It
        is, for example, only a certain number of vibrations per second
        of the <i>taijas tatwa</i> that affects the eye, and so on with
        the other senses. The case with the mind is similar. It is only
        when mental and external tatwic tensions are equal that the mind
        begins to vibrate as it comes into contact with the external
        world. Just as the varying states of the external organs make us
        more or less sensitive to ordinary sensation, so different men
        might not hear the same sounds, might not see the same sights,
        the mental tatwas might not be affected by percepts of the same
        strength, or might be affected in different degrees by percepts
        of the same strength. The question is, how is the variation of
        this mental tatwic strength produced? By exercise, and the
        absence of exercise. If we accustom the mind, just as we do the
        body, to any particular precept or concept, the mind easily
        turns to those percepts and concepts. If, however, we give up
        the exercise, the mind becomes stiff and ceases by degrees to
        respond to these percepts and concepts. This is the phenomenon
        of forgetting. Let a student whose literary exercises is just
        opening the buds of his mind, whose mind is just gaining
        strength enough to see into the causes and effects of things,
        give up his exercise. His mind will begin to lose that nice
        perception. The stiffer the mind becomes the less will the
        casual relation affect him, and the less he will know of it,
        until at last he loses all his power. </p>
      <p>Ceaseless influence and activity of one sort being impossible
        in the ordinary course of time, every impression tends to pass
        away as soon as it is made. Its degree of stability depends upon
        the duration of the exercise. But although activity of one sort
        is impracticable, activity of some sort is always present in the
        mind. With every action the color of the mind changes, and one
        color may take so deep a root in the mind as to remain there for
        ages upon ages, to say nothing of minutes, hours, days and
        years. Just as time takes ages to demolish the impressions of
        the physical plane, just as marks of incision upon the skin may
        not pass away even in two decades, so also it takes ages to
        demolish the impressions of the mind. Hundreds and thousands of
        years may this be spent in <i>devachan</i> in order to wear
        away those antagonistic impressions that the mind has contracted
        in earthly life. By antagonistic impressions, I mean those
        impressions that are not compatible with the state of <i>moksha</i>,
        and have about them a tinge of earthly life. </p>
      <p>With every moment the mind changes its color, whether the
        impression be adding or subtracting. These changes are
        temporary. But there is at the same time a permanent change
        going on in the color of the mind. With every little act of our
        worldly experience, the evolutionary tide of progress is gaining
        strength and passing into variety. The color is constantly
        changing. But the same general color is maintained under
        ordinary circumstances, during one earthly life. Under
        extraordinary circumstances we might have men having two
        memories. Under such circumstances as in the case of approaching
        death, the accumulated forces of a whole life combine into a
        different color. The tension, so to speak, becomes different
        from what it was before. Nothing can put the mind into the same
        state again. This general color of the mind differing from that
        of other minds, and yet retaining its general character for a
        whole life, gives us the consciousness of personal identity. In
        every act that has been done, or that is, or might be done, the
        soul sees the same general color, and hence the feeling of
        personal identity. In death the general color changes, and
        although we have the same mind, we have a different
        consciousness. Hence no continuance of the feeling of personal
        identity is possible through death. </p>
      <p>Such is a brief account of the <i>manomaya kosha</i>, the
        mental coil in the ordinary state. The influence of the higher
        principle (the <i>vijnana maya kosha</i>) through the exercise
        of yoga induces in the mind a number of other manifestations.
        Psychic manifestations show themselves in the mind and the <i>prana</i>,
        in the same way as mental manifestations are seen influencing
        and regulating the <i>prana</i>. </p>
      <p><a name="ix"></a><b><font size="+1">IX. The Mind (II) ~</font></b>
      </p>
      <p>As has been seen, the universe has five planes of existence
        (which may also be divided into seven). The forms of the earth,
        which are little pictures of the universe, also have the same
        five planes. In some of these organisms the higher planes of
        existence are absolutely latent. In man, in the present age, the
        <i>Vijnana maya kosha</i> and the lower principles make their
        appearance. </p>
      <p>We have had an insight into the nature of the macrocosmic <i>prana</i>,
        and we have seen that almost every point in this ocean of life
        represents a separate individual organism. </p>
      <p>The case is similar with the macrocosmic mind. Every <i>truti</i>
        of that center takes in the whole of the macrocosmic mind in the
        same way. From every point the tatwic rays of the mental ocean
        go to every point, and thus every point is a little picture of
        the universal mind. This is the individual mind. </p>
      <p>The Univesal mind is the original of all the centers of <i>Prana</i>,
        in the same way as the solar <i>prana</i> is the original of
        the species of earth-life. Individual mind, too, is similarly
        the original of all the individual manifestations of the <i>prana



          maya kosha</i>. Similarly the soul, and the individual spirit
        on the highest plane, is the perfect picture of all that comes
        below. </p>
      <p>With the four higher planes of life there are four different
        states of consciousness, the waking, the dreaming, the sleeping,
        and the <i>Tureya</i>. </p>
      <p>With these remarks the following extract from the <i>Prasnopnishat</i>
        will be intelligible and instructive. </p>
      <p>"Now Sauryayana Gargya asked him, ‘Sir, in this body, what
        sleeps, and what remains awakened? Which of these luminous
        beings sees dreams? Who has this rest? In whom do all these
        [manifestations] rest in the potential unmanifested state?’ </p>
      <p>"He answered him, ‘O Gargya, as the rays of the setting sun are
        all collected in the luminous shell, and then go out again, as
        he rises again and again, so all that is collected in the
        luminous shell of mind beyond. For this reason then, the man
        does not hear, does not see, does not smell, does not taste,
        does not touch, does not take, does not cohabit, does not
        excrete, does not go on. They say that he sleeps. The fires of <i>prana</i>
        alone remain awakened in his body. The <i>apana</i> is the <i>Garhapatya</i>
        fire; the <i>Vyana</i> is the right hand fire. The <i>prana</i>
        is the <i>ahavanurya</i> fire, which is made by the <i>Garhapatya</i>.
        That which carries equally everywhere the oblations of food and
        air, is the <i>samana</i>. The mind (<i>manas</i>) is the
        sacrificer (<i>vajmana</i>). The <i>Udana</i> is the fruit of
        the sacrifice. He carries the sacrificer every day to <i>Brahma</i>.
        Here this luminous being [the mind] enjoys great things in
        dreams. Whatever was seen, he sees again as if it were real;
        whatever was experienced in different countries, in different
        directions, he experiences the same again and again -- the seen
        and the unseen, the heard or the unheard, thought or not thought
        upon. He sees all, appearing as the self of all manifestations.
      </p>
      <p>"’When he is overpowered by the <i>taijas</i>, then this
        luminous being sees no dreams in this state; then there appears
        in the body this rest [the dreamless sleep]. </p>
      <p>"’In this state, my dear pupil, all [that is enumerated below]
        stays in the ulterior <i>atma</i>, like birds that resort to a
        tree for habitation -- the <i>prithivi</i> composite and the <i>prithivi</i>
        non-composite; the <i>apas</i> composite and the <i>apas</i>
        non-composite; the <i>taijas</i> composite and the <i>taijas</i>
        non-composite; the <i>vayu</i> composite and the <i>vayu</i>
        non-composite; the <i>akasa</i> composite and the <i>akasa</i>
        non-composite; the sight and the visible, the hearing and the
        audible, the smell and the smellable, the taste and the
        tasteable, the touch and the tangible, the speech and the
        utterable, the hands and whatever might be grasped, the
        generative organ and the excrements, the feet and that which may
        be gone over, the faculty and the object of doubt, the faculty
        and the object of egoism, the faculty and the object of memory,
        the light and that which might be enlightened, the <i>prana</i>
        and that which keeps it together. </p>
      <p>"’The soul is the <i>Vijnana atma</i>, the seer, the toucher,
        the hearer, the smeller, the taster, the doubter, the
        ascertainer, the agent. This soul [the <i>Vijnana atma</i>]
        stays in the ulterior, unchangeable <i>atma</i> [the <i>ananda</i>].



      </p>
      <p>"’So there are four <i>atma</i> -- the life, the mind, the
        soul, the spirit. The ultimate force that lies at the root
        macrocosmic Power of all the manifestation of soul, mind, and
        the life the principle, is the spirit.’" </p>
      <p>By composite is meant that <i>tatwa</i> which has come into
        existence after the division into five, noticed in the first
        essay. The non-composite means a <i>tatwa</i> before the
        division into five. </p>
      <p>The principal interest of this quotation lies in presenting in
        authoritative fashion the views that have already been
        propounded. The next essay explains one of the most important
        functions of the macrocosmic Power and Mind, that of recording
        the human actions, and touches upon some other rather important
        truths. </p>
      <p><a name="x"></a><b><font size="+1">X. The Cosmic Picture
            Gallery ~</font></b> </p>
      <p>We are directed by our <i>Guru</i> in the philosophy of tatwas
        to look into vacant space toward the sky, when the sky is
        perfectly clear, and fix your attention there with the utmost
        possible strength. </p>
      <p>We are told that after sufficient practice we shall see there a
        variety of pictures -- the most beautiful landscapes, the most
        gorgeous palaces of the world, and men, women and children in
        all the varying aspects of life. How is such a thing possible?
        What do we learn by this practical lesson in the science of
        attention? </p>
      <p>I think I have described with sufficient explicitness in the
        essays, the ocean of prana with the sun for its center, and have
        given a hint sufficiently suggestive of the nature of the
        macrocosmic mental and psychic atmospheres. It is of the
        essential nature of these atmospheres that every point therein
        forms a center of action and reaction for the whole ocean. From
        what has already been said, it will be plain that each of these
        atmospheres has a limit of its own. The terrestrial atmosphere
        extends only to a few miles, and the external boundary line of
        this sphere must, it will be readily understood, give it the
        appearance of an orange, just like that of the earth. The case
        is the same with the solar <i>prana</i>, and the higher
        atmospheres. To begin with the terrestrial <i>Prana</i>, which
        has the measured limits of our atmosphere. Every little atom of
        our earth, and the most perfect organisms, as well as the most
        imperfect, makes a center of action and reaction for the tatwic
        currents of terrestrial <i>Prana</i>. The <i>prana</i> has the
        capability of being thrown into the shape of every organism or,
        to use a different language, the rays of prana as they fall upon
        every organism are returned from that organism according to the
        well-known laws of reflection. These rays, as is again well
        known, carry within themselves our pictures. Bearing these
        within them, they go up to the limit of the terrestrial <i>prana</i>
        noted above. It will be easy to conceive that within the
        imaginary sphere that surrounds our terrestrial prana, we now
        have a magnified picture of our central organism. Not one
        organism only, but all the smallest points, the most imperfect
        beginnings of organized life, as well as the most perfect
        organisms -- all are pictured in this imaginary sphere. It is a
        magnificent picture-gallery; all that is seen or heard, touched,
        tasted or smelled on the face of the earth has a glorious and
        magnified picture there. At the limit of this terrestrial <i>prana</i>,
        the picture-forming tatwic rays exercise a double function. </p>
      <p>Firstly they throw the sympathetic tatwic chords of the solar <i>prana</i>
        into similar motion. That is to say, these pictures are now
        consigned to the solar <i>prana</i>, from whence in due course
        they reach step by step to the universal intelligence itself. </p>
      <p>Secondly, these rays react upon themselves, and turning back
        from the limiting sphere, are again reflected back to the
        center. </p>
      <p>It is these pictures that the attentive mind sees in its
        noonday gaze into vacancy, and it is these pictures, seen in
        this mysterious way, that give us the finest food for our
        imagination and intellect, and supply us with a far-reaching
        clue to the nature and working of the laws that govern the life
        of the macrocosm and the microcosm. For these pictures tell us
        that the smallest of our actions, on whatever plane of our
        existence, actions that may be so insignificant to us as to pass
        unnoticed even by ourselves, are destined to receive an
        everlasting record, as the effect of the past and the cause of
        the future. These pictures again tell us of the existence of the
        five universal tatwas that play so important a part in the
        universe. It is these pictures that lead us to the discovery of
        the manifold constitution of man and the universe, and of those
        powers of the mind that have not yet received recognition at the
        hands of the official science of the day. </p>
      <p>That these truths have found place in the <i>Upanishad</i> may
        be seen from the following quotation from the <i>Ishopnishat</i>,
        <i>mantra</i> 4: </p>
      <p>"The <i>Atma</i> does not move: is one: is faster than the
        mind: the senses reach it not: as it is the foremost in motion.
        It goes beyond the others in rapid motion while itself at rest,
        in it the Recorder preserves the actions." </p>
      <p>In the above quotation it is the word <i>Matarishwa</i> that I
        translate "Recorder". Ordinarily the word is translated as air,
        and so far as I know, the word has never been understood clearly
        in the sense of the "Recorder". My view, therefore, may be
        further explained with advantage. </p>
      <p>The word is a compound of the words <i>matari</i> and <i>swah</i>.
        The word matari is the locative case of <i>matri</i> which
        ordinarily means mother, but which is rendered here as space, as
        the substratum of distance, from the root <i>ma</i>, to
        measure. The second word of the compound means the breather,
        coming as it does from the root <i>Swas</i>, to breathe. Hence
        the compound means "he who breathes in space". In explaining
        this word the commentator Sankaracharya goes on to say: </p>
      <p>"The word ‘<i>Matarishwa</i>’, which has been derived as above,
        means the <i>Vayu</i> [the mover] which carries in it all the
        manifestations of <i>prana</i>, which is action itself, that
        which is the substratum of all the groups of causes and effects,
        and in which all the causes and effects are held like beads in a
        thread, that which is given the name of <i>sutra</i> [the
        thread] inasmuch as it holds in itself the whole of the world."
      </p>
      <p>It is further said that the "actions" in the above quotation
        which this <i>matarishwa</i> holds in itself are all the
        movements of the individualized <i>prana</i>, as well as the
        actions of heating, lighting, ruining, etc., of the macrocosmic
        powers known as <i>Agni</i>, etc. </p>
      <p>Now such a thing can by no means be the atmospheric air. It is
        evidently that phase of <i>prana</i> which acts as carrying the
        pictures of all actions, all motions from every point of space
        to every other point and to the limits of the <i>surya mandala</i>.
        This phase of <i>prana</i> is nothing more or less than the
        Recorder. It holds in itself forever and ever all the causes and
        effects, the antecedents and consequents of this world of ours.
      </p>
      <p>It is action itself. This means that all action is a change of
        phase of <i>prana</i>. </p>
      <p>It is said in the above quotation that this Recorder lives in
        the <i>atma</i>. Inasmuch as the <i>atma</i> exists, this
        Power always performs its function. The <i>prana</i> draws its
        life itself from the <i>atma</i>, and accordingly we find a
        similarity between the dualities of the two. It is said of the
        atma in the above extract that it does not move, and yet it
        moves faster than the mind. These appear to be contradictory
        qualities at first sigh, and it is such qualities that make the
        ordinary God of commonplace theologians the absurd being he
        always looks to be. Let us, however, apply these qualities to <i>prana</i>,
        and once understood on this plane, they will be quite as clearly
        understood on the highest plane, the atma. It has been said more
        than once that from every point of the ocean of prana the tatwic
        rays fly in every direction, to every point within the <i>surya
          mandala</i>. Thus the ocean of prana is in eternal motion. For
        all this, however, does one point of this ocean ever change its
        place? Of course not. Thus while every point keeps its place,
        every point at the same time goes and shows itself in every
        other point. </p>
      <p>It is the same simple way that the all-pervading atma is in
        eternal motion and yet always at rest. </p>
      <p>The case is similar with all the planes of life; all our
        actions, all our thoughts, all our aspirations, receive an
        everlasting record in the books of <i>Matarishwa</i>. </p>
      <p>I must now notice these pictures in a little more detail. The
        science of photography tells us that under certain conditions
        the visual pictures can be caught on the plane of the sensitive
        film. But how can we account for the reading of letters at a
        distance of 40 miles or more? Such phenomena are a matter of
        personal experience to me. Very recently, while sitting
        abstracted, or it may be in a kind of dream, about 4 o’clock in
        the morning, I read a postcard written by a friend to a friend
        about me, the very same night, at a distance of almost 30 miles.
        One more thing must be noticed here, I think. Almost half the
        card spoke about me, and the rest referred to other matters that
        might have a passing interest for me, but could not be
        engrossing. Now this rest of the card did not come before my
        eyes very clearly, and I felt that with all my effort I could
        not even keep my eye upon those lines or a sufficiently long
        time to understand them, but was irresistibly drawn towards the
        paragraph that spoke of me, and which I could read very clearly.
        Four days after this, the addressee showed it to me; it was
        exactly the same, sentence by sentence (so far as I could
        remember), as I had seen before. I mention this phenomenon in
        particular, as in it the various prerequisites for the
        production of these phenomena are clearly defined. We learn from
        an analysis of this incident the following facts: </p>
      <p>(1) When he was writing, the writer of the card meant that I
        should read the card, and especially the paragraph that
        concerned me. </p>
      <p>(2) I was very anxious to know the news about me that the card
        contained. </p>
      <p>(3) In the frame of mind mentioned above my friend wrote the
        card. What happened? The picture of his thoughts on the card,
        both on the physical and the mental plane, flew in every
        direction along the tatwic rays of the macrocosmic <i>prana</i>
        and mind. A picture was immediately made on the macrocosmic
        spheres, and from thence it bent its rays towards the
        destination of the postcard. No doubt all minds in the earth
        received a shock of this current of thought at the same time.
        But my mind alone was sensitive to the card and the news it
        contained. It was, therefore, on my mind alone that any
        impression was made. The rays were, as it were, refracted into
        my mind, and the result described above followed. </p>
      <p>It follows from this illustration that in order to receive the
        pictorial rays of the prana we must have a mind in a state of
        sympathy, and not of antipathy; that is to say, a mind free from
        all action or intense feeling for the time being is the fittest
        receptacle for the pictorial representations of the cosmos, and
        so for a correct knowledge of the past and the future. And if we
        have an intense desire to know the thing, so much the better for
        us. It is in this way that the divine occultist reads the
        records of the past in the book of nature, and it is on this
        road that the beginner of this science must walk according to
        the direction of our <i>Guru</i>. </p>
      <p>It must be understood that everything in every aspect that has
        been or is being n our planet has a legible record in the book
        of nature, and the tatwic rays of the <i>prana</i> and the mind
        are constantly bringing the outlines of these pictures back to
        us. It is to a great extent due to this that the past never
        leaves us, but always lives within us, although many of its most
        magnificent monuments have been forever effaced from the face of
        our planet for the ordinary gaze. These returning rays are
        always inclined toward the center that originally gave them
        birth. In the case of the mineral surroundings of terrestrial
        phenomena these centers are preserved intact for ages upon ages,
        and it is quite possible for any sensitive mind, at any time, to
        turn these rays towards itself by coming into contact with any
        material remains of historic phenomena. A stone unearthed at
        Pompeii is pictured as part of the great event that destroyed
        the city, and the rays of that picture naturally are inclined
        towards that piece of stone. If Mrs. Denton puts the stone to
        her forehead, a sympathetic and receptive condition is the only
        pre-requisite for the transference of the whole picture to her
        mind. This sympathetic state of mind may be natural to a person,
        or it may be acquired. It may be mentioned that what we are in
        the habit of calling natural powers are really acquired, but
        they have been acquired in previous incarnations. <i>Shiva</i>
        says: </p>
      <p>"There are some to whom the tatwas become known, when the mind
        is purified by habituation, either by the acquired velocity of
        other births or by the kindness of the <i>Guru</i>." </p>
      <p>It seems that two pieces of granite, the same to all intents
        and purposes externally, may have an entirely different tatwic
        color, for the color of a thing depends to a very great extent
        upon its tatwic surrounding. It is this occult color that
        constitutes the real soul of things, although the reader must by
        this time know that the Sanskrit word <i>prana</i> is more
        appropriate. </p>
      <p>It is no myth to say that the practiced <i>yogi</i> might
        bring the picture of any part of the world, past or present,
        before his mind’s eye with a single effort of his will. And not
        only visual pictures, as our illustration might lead the reader
        to think. The preservation and formation of visual pictures is
        only the work of the luminiferous ether, the <i>taijas tatwa</i>.
        The other tatwas perform their functions as well. The <i>akasa</i>
        or soniferous ether preserves all the sounds that have ever been
        heard or are being heard on earth, and similarly the remaining
        three other preserve the records of the remaining sensations. We
        see, therefore, that combining all these pictures, a <i>yogi</i>
        in contemplation might have before his mind’s eye any man at any
        distance whatsoever and might hear his voice also. Glyndon, in
        Italy, seeing and hearing the conversation of Viola and Zanoni
        in their distant home, is therefore not merely a dream of the
        poet; it is a scientific reality. The only thing necessary is to
        have a sympathetic mind. The phenomena of mental telepathy,
        psychometry, clairvoyance and clairaudience, are all phases of
        this tatwic action. Once understood, it is all a very simple
        affair. It may be useful in this place to offer some reflections
        as to how these pictorial representations of a man’s present go
        to shape his future. I shall first attempt to show how complete
        the record is. At the outset I may remind the reader of what I
        have said about the tatwic color of everything. It is this that
        gives individuality even to a piece of stone. </p>
      <p>This pictorial whole is only the cosmic counterpart of the
        individual <i>prana maya kosha</i> (the coil of life). It is
        possible that anyone who may not have thoroughly understood the
        manner of the storing up of tatwic energy in the individual <i>prana</i>
        may more easily comprehend the phenomena in its cosmic
        counterpart. In fact, the macrocosmic and microcosmic phenomena
        are both links of the same chain, and both will conduce to the
        thorough understanding of the whole. Suppose a man stands on a
        mountain, with the finest prospect of nature stretched out
        before his eyes. As he stands there contemplating this wealth of
        beauty, his picture in this posture is at once made in the
        ecliptic. Not only is his external; appearance pictured, but the
        hue of is life receives the fullest representation. If the <i>agni




          tatwa</i> prevails in him at that moment, if there is the
        light of satisfaction in his face, if the look in his eyes is
        calm, collected and pleasant, if he is so much absorbed in the
        gaze as to forget everything else, tatwas separate or in
        composite will do their duty, and all the satisfaction,
        calmness, pleasure, attention or inattention will be represented
        to the finest degree in the sphere of the ecliptic. If he walks
        or runs, comes down or jumps up or forward, the tatwic rays of <i>prana</i>
        picture the generating and the generated colors with the utmost
        faithfulness in the same retentive sphere. </p>
      <p>A man stands with a weapon in his hand, with the look of
        cruelty in his eye, with the glow of inhumanity in his veins,
        his victim, man or animal, helpless or struggling before him.
        The whole phenomenon is instantly recorded. There stands the
        murderer and the victim in their truest possible colors, there
        is the solitary room or the jungle, the dirty shed or the filthy
        slaughterhouse; all are there as surely and certainly as they
        are in the eye of the murderer r the victim himself. </p>
      <p>Let us again change the scene. We have a liar before us. He
        tells a lie, and thereby injures some brother man. No sooner is
        the word uttered than the <i>akasa</i> sets to work with all
        possible activity. There we have the most faithful
        representation. The liar is there from the reflection that the
        thought if the injured person throws into the individual <i>prana</i>;
        there is the injured man also. The words are there with all the
        energy of the contemplated wrong. And if that contemplated wrong
        is completed, there is also the change for the worse that his
        mendacity has produced in the victim. There is nothing of the
        surroundings, the antecedent and the consequent postures -- the
        causes and effects -- that is not represented there. </p>
      <p>The scene changes, and we come to a thief. Let the night be as
        dark as it may, let the thief be a circumspect and wary as he
        can; our picture is there with all its colors well defined,
        though perhaps not so prominent. The time, the house, the wall,
        the sleeping and injured inmates, the stolen property, the
        subsequent day, the sorrowful householders, with all the
        antecedent and consequent postures, are pictured. And this is
        not only for the murderer, the thief, or the liar, but for the
        adulterer, the forger, the villain who thinks his crime is
        hidden from every human eye. Their deeds, like all deeds that
        have ever been done, are vividly, clearly, exactly recorded in
        nature’s picture gallery. Instances might be multiplied, but it
        is unnecessary. What has been said is sufficient to explain the
        principle, and the application is useful and not very difficult.
        But now we must bring our pictures back from our gallery. </p>
      <p>We have seen that time and space and all the possible factors
        of a phenomenon receive an accurate representation there, and
        these tatwic rays are united to the time that saw them leaving
        their record on the plane of our pictorial region. When, in the
        course of ages, the same Time throws its shade again upon the
        earth, the pictorial rays, stored up long since, energize
        man-producing matter, and shape it according to their own
        potential energy, which now begins to become active. It will be
        readily conceded that the sun dives life to the earth -- to men
        as well as to vegetables and minerals. Solar life takes human
        shape in the womb of the mother, and this is only an infusion of
        some one set of our pictorial rays into the sympathetic life
        that already shows itself on our planet. These rays thus produce
        for themselves a gross human body in the womb of the mother, and
        then having the now somewhat different and differing maternal
        body, start on their terrestrial journey. As time advances, the
        pictorial representation changes it tatwic postures, and with it
        the gross body does the same. </p>
      <p>In the case of the rebirth of the man we saw gazing on the
        mountains, the calm, watchful, contented attitude of the mind
        that he cultivated then has its influence upon the organism now,
        and once more the man enjoys the beauty of nature and so is
        pleased and happy. </p>
      <p>But now take the case of the cruel murderer. He is by nature
        cruel, and he still yearns to murder and destroy, and he could
        not be restrained from his horrible practices; but the picture
        of the ebbing life of his victim is now part and parcel of his
        constitution, the pain, the terror, and the feeling of despair
        and helplessness are there in all their strength. Occasionally
        he feels as if the blood of life were leaving his very veins.
        There is no apparent cause, and yet he suffers pain; he is
        subject to unaccountable fits of terror, despair and
        helplessness. His life is miserable; slowly but surely it wanes
        away. </p>
      <p>Let the curtain fall on this stage. The incarnated thief now
        comes on the stage. His friends leave him one by one or he is
        driven away from them. The picture of the lonely house must
        assert its power over him. He is doomed to a lonely house. The
        picture of somebody coming into the house through some
        unfrequented part and stealing some of his property, makes its
        appearance with the fullest strength. The man is doomed to
        eternal cowardice. He draws towards himself the same grief and
        heart-rending that he caused to others long ago. This posture of
        heart-rending grief has its influence upon him in the ordinary
        way, and it creates its surrounding under the same influence. </p>
      <p>These illustrations are sufficient to explain the law according
        to which these cosmic pictures govern our future lives. Whatever
        other sins may be committed under the innumerable circumstance
        of life, their tatwic effects can be traced easily through the
        pictorial representations of the cosmos. </p>
      <p>It is not difficult to understand that the picture of each
        individual organism upon the face of the earth is pictured in <i>prana</i>,
        and it is these pictures, in my opinion, that correspond to the
        ideas of Plato on the highest plane of existence. A very
        interesting question arises at this point. Are these pictures of
        eternal existence, or do they only come into existence after
        formations have taken place on the terrestrial plane? <i>Ex
          nihilo nihil fit</i> is a well-known doctrine of philosophy,
        and I hold with Vyasa that the representations (what we now call
        pictures) of all objects in their generic, specific, and
        individual capacities have been existing forever in the
        universal mind. <i>Swara</i>, or what may be called the Breath
        of God, the Breath of Life, is nothing more or less than
        abstract intelligence, as has been explained, or intelligent
        motion, if such an expression is better understood. Our book
        says: </p>
      <p>"In the <i>swara</i> are pictured, or represented, the <i>Vedas</i>
        and the <i>Sastras</i>, in the <i>swara</i> the highest <i>Gandharvas</i>,
        and in the <i>swara</i> all the three worlds; the <i>swara</i>
        is <i>atma</i> itself." </p>
      <p>It is not necessary to enter more thoroughly into a discussion
        of this problem; the suggestion is sufficient. It might be said,
        however, that all formation in progress on the face of our
        planet is the assuming by everything under the influence of
        solar ideas of the shape of these ideas. The process is quite
        similar to the process of wet earth taking impressions of
        anything that is pressed upon it. The idea of anything is its
        soul. </p>
      <p>Human souls (<i>prana maya kosha</i>) exist in this sphere just
        like the souls of other things, and are affected in that home of
        theirs by terrestrial experience in the manner mentioned above.
      </p>
      <p>In the course of ages, these ideas make their appearance in the
        physical plane again and again, according to the laws hinted at
        previously. </p>
      <p>I have also said that these pictures have their counterparts in
        the mental and the higher atmospheres. Now it might be said that
        just as these solar pictures recur again and again, there are
        times at which these mental pictures also recur. The ordinary
        deaths known to us are terrestrial deaths. This means to say
        that the influence of the solar pictures is withdrawn for some
        time from the earth. After some time, the duration depending
        upon the colors of the picture, they throw their influence again
        upon the earth, and we have terrestrial rebirth. We may die any
        number of terrestrial deaths, and yet our solar life might not
        be extinct. </p>
      <p>But men of the present <i>manwantara</i> might die solar
        deaths under certain circumstances. Then they pass out of the
        influence of the sun and are born again only in the region of
        the second <i>Manu</i>. Men who now die solar deaths will
        remain in the state of bliss all through the present <i>manwantara</i>.
        Their rebirth might also be delayed for more than one <i>manwantara</i>.
        All these pictures remain in the bosom of <i>Manu</i> during
        the <i>manwantarapralaya</i>. In the same way, men might
        undergo higher deaths, and pass their time in a state of even
        higher and more enduring bliss. The mental coil may be broken,
        too, just as the gross, the terrestrial, and the solar might be,
        and then the blessed soul remains in bliss and unborn until the
        dawn of the second day of <i>Brahma</i>. Higher still and
        longer still is the state that follows Brahmic death. Then the
        spirit is at rest for the remaining <i>Kalpa</i> and the <i>Mahapralaya</i>
        that follows. After this it will be easy to understand the
        meaning of the Hindu doctrine, that during the night of <i>Brahma</i>
        the human soul and the whole of the universe is hidden in the
        bosom of <i>Brahma</i> like the tree in the seed. </p>
      <p><a name="xi"></a><b><font size="+1">XI. The Manifestations of
            Psychic Force ~</font></b> </p>
      <p>Psychic Force is the form of matter known as <i>vijnana</i> in
        active connection with the mental and life matters. In the
        quotation given above from the <i>Ishnopnishat</i>, it has been
        said that the <i>deva</i> -- the macrocosmic and microcosmic
        manifestations of <i>prana</i> -- do not reach the <i>atma</i>,
        inasmuch as it moves faster than even the mind. The <i>tatwas</i>
        of <i>prana</i> move with a certain momentum. The mind has
        greater velocity, and psychic matter greater still. In the
        presence of the higher, the lower plane always appears to be at
        rest, and is always amenable to its influence. Creation is a
        manifestation of the various macrocosmic spheres with their
        various centers. In each of these spheres -- the <i>prana</i>,
        the <i>manas</i>, and the <i>vijnana</i> -- the universal
        tatwic rays give birth to innumerable individualities on their
        own planes. Each <i>truti</i> on the plane of <i>prana</i> is
        a life-coil (<i>prana maya kosha</i>). The rays that give
        existence to each of these <i>truti</i> come from each and all
        of the other <i>truti</i>, which are situated in the space
        allotted to each of the five <i>tatwas</i> and their
        innumerable admixtures, and which represent therefore all the
        possible tatwic manifestations of life. </p>
      <p>On the plane of <i>manas</i> each mental <i>truti</i>
        represents an individual mind. Each individual mind is given
        birth to by mental tatwic rays from the other quarter. These
        rays came from all the other <i>truti</i> situated under the
        dominion of each of the five <i>tatwas</i> and their
        innumerable admixtures and representing therefore all the
        possible tatwic phases of mental life. </p>
      <p>On the psychic plane, each <i>truti</i> represents an
        individual soul brought into existence by the psychic <i>tatwas</i>
        flying from every point to every other point. These rays come
        from every <i>truti</i> situated under the dominion of each of
        the five tatwas and their innumerable admixtures, and thus
        representing all the possible manifestations of psychic life. </p>
      <p>The latter class of <i>truti</i> on the various planes of
        existence are the so-called gods and goddesses. The former class
        are coils that manifest themselves in earthly life. </p>
      <p>Each psychic <i>truti</i> is thus a little reservoir of every
        possible tatwic phase of life that might manifest itself on the
        lower planes of existence. And so, sending its rays downward
        just like the sun, these <i>truti</i> manifest themselves in
        the <i>truti</i> of the lower planes. According to the
        prevalent phase of tatwic color in these three sets of <i>truti</i>,
        the <i>vijana</i> (psychic) selects its mind, the mind selects
        its coil, and in the end the life-coil creates its habitation in
        the earth. </p>
      <p>The first function of the individual <i>truti vijana</i> is to
        sustain in the life of the mental <i>truti</i> just as the
        macrocosmic <i>vijana</i> sustains the life of the macrocosmic
        mind. And so also does the mental <i>truti</i> sustain the life
        of the individual <i>truti</i> of <i>prana</i>. In this state,
        the souls are conscious only of their subjectivity with
        reference to the mind and the <i>prana</i>. They know that they
        sustain the lower <i>truti</i>, they know themselves, they know
        all the other psychic <i>truti</i>, and they know the whole of
        the macrocosm of <i>Iswara</i>, the tatwic rays reflecting
        every point into their indvidual consciousness. They are
        omniscient; they are perfectly happy because they are perfectly
        balanced. </p>
      <p>When the <i>prana maya kosha</i> enters the habitation of
        earth, the soul is assailed by finitude for the first time. This
        means a curtailment, or rather the creation of a new curtailed
        consciousness. For long ages the soul takes no note of these
        finite sensations, but as the impressions gain greater and
        greater strength they are deluded into a belief of identity with
        these finite impressions. From absolute subjectivity
        consciousness is transferred to relative passivity. A new world
        of appearances is created. This is their fall. How these
        sensations and perceptions, etc., are born, and how they affect
        the soul, already has been discussed. How the soul is awakened
        out of this forgetfulness and what it does then to liberate
        itself will come further on. </p>
      <p>It will be seen at this stage that the soul lives two lives, an
        active and a passive. In the active capacity it goes on
        governing and sustaining the substantial life of the lower <i>truti</i>.
        In the passive capacity it forgets itself and deludes itself
        into identity with the changes of the lower <i>truti</i>
        imprinted upon them by the external tatwas. The consciousness is
        transferred to finite phases. </p>
      <p>The whole fight of the soul upon reawakening consists in the
        attempt to do away with its passive capacity and regain this
        pristine purity. This fight is <i>yoga</i>, and the powers that
        yoga evokes in the mind and the <i>prana</i> are nothing more
        than tatwic manifestations of the psychic force, calculated to
        destroy the power of the external world on the soul. This
        constant change of phase in the new unreal finite coils of
        existence is the upward march of the life current from the
        beginnings of relative consciousness to the original absolute
        state. </p>
      <p>There is no difficulty in understanding the how of these
        manifestations. They are there in the psychic reservoir, and
        they simply show themselves when the lower trutis assume the
        state of sympathetic polish and tatwic inclination. Thus the
        spectrum only shows itself when certain objects assume the
        polish and form of a prism. </p>
      <p>Ordinarily the psychic force does not manifest itself either in
        the <i>prana</i> or the mind in any uncommon phase. Humanity
        progresses as a whole, and whatever manifestations of this force
        take place, they take in races as a whole. Finite minds are
        therefore slow to recognize it. </p>
      <p>But all the individuals of a race do not have the same strength
        of tatwic phase. Some show greater sympathy with the psychic
        force in one or more of its component tatwic phases. Such
        organisms are called mediums. In them the particular tatwic
        phase of psychic force with which they are in greater sympathy
        than the rest of their mind, makes its uncommon appearance. This
        difference of individual sympathy is caused by a difference of
        degree in the commissions and omission of different individuals,
        or by the practice of <i>yoga</i>. </p>
      <p>In this way, this psychic force might manifest itself in the
        shape of all the innumerable possibilities of tatwic
        combination. So far as theory is concerned, these manifestations
        might cover the whole domain of tatwic manifestations in the
        visible macrocosm (and also in the invisible, which, however, we
        do not know). These manifestations may violate all our present
        notions of time and space, cause and effect, force and matter.
        Intelligently utilized, this force might very well perform the
        functions of the <i>vril</i> of&nbsp; "The Coming Race". The
        following essays will trace some of these manifestations on the
        plane of the mind. </p>
      <p><a name="xii"></a><b><font size="+1">XII. <i>Yoga</i> -- The
            Soul (I) ~</font></b> </p>
      <p>I have described two principles of the human constitution: <i>prana</i>
        and <i>manas</i>. Something also has been said about the nature
        and relations of the soul. The gross body was omitted as needing
        no special handling. </p>
      <p>The five manifestations of each of the two principles (the <i>prana</i>
        and the <i>manas</i>), it may be mentioned, may be either
        fortunate or unfortunate. Those manifestations are fortunate
        which are consonant with our true culture, which lead us to our
        highest spiritual development, the <i>summum bonum</i> of
        humanity. Those that keep us chained to the sphere of recurring
        births and deaths may be called unfortunate. On each of the two
        planes of life (<i>prana</i> and <i>manas</i>) there is a
        possibility of double existence. We might have a fortunate and
        an unfortunate <i>prana</i>, a happy and an unhappy mind.
        Considering these two to be four, the number of principles of
        the human constitution might be raised from five to seven. The
        unhappy intelligences of the one plane ally themselves with the
        unhappy ones of the other, the happy ones with the happy, and we
        have in the human constitution an arrangement of principles
        something like the following: </p>
      <p>(1) The gross body (<i>sthula sarira</i>), (2) the unhappy <i>prana</i>,
        (3) the unhappy mind, (4) the happy <i>prana</i>, (5) the happy
        mind, (6) the soul (<i>vijana</i>), and (7) the spirit (<i>ananda</i>).



      </p>
      <p>The fundamental division in the fivefold division is upadhi,
        the particular and distinct state of matter (<i>prakriti</i>) in
        each case; in the sevenfold division it is the nature of <i>Karma</i>
        with reference to its effect upon human evolution. </p>
      <p>Both the sets of these powers, the blessed and the unhappy,
        work upon the same plane, and although the blessed
        manifestations tend in the long run towards the state of <i>moksha</i>,
        that state is not reached unless and until the higher powers
        (the <i>siddhi</i>) are induced in the mind by the exercise of
        <i>yoga</i>. <i>Yoga</i> is a power of the soul. Therefore it
        is necessary to say something about the soul and <i>Yoga</i>
        before the higher powers of the mind can be intelligibly
        described. <i>Yoga</i> is the science of human culture in the
        highest sense of the word. Its purpose is the purification and
        strengthening of the mind. By its exercise is filled with high
        aspirations, and acquires divine powers, while the unhappy
        tendencies die out. The second and third principles are burnt up
        by the fire of divine knowledge, and the state of what is called
        salvation in life is attained. By and bye the fourth principle
        too becomes neutralized, and the soul passes into a state of <i>manwantaric



          moksha</i>. The soul may pass higher still according to the
        strength of her exercise. When the mind too is at rest, as in
        sound sleep (<i>sushupti</i>) during life, the omniscience of
        the <i>vijnana</i> is reached. There is still a higher state:
        the state of <i>ananda</i>. Such are the results of <i>yoga</i>.
        I must now describe the nature of the thing and the process of
        acquirement. </p>
      <p>So far as the nature of <i>Yoga</i> is concerned, I may say
        that mankind has reached its present state of development by the
        exercise of this great power. Nature herself is a great <i>Yogi</i>,
        and humanity has been, and is being, purified into perfection by
        the exercise of her sleepless will. Man need only imitate the
        great teacher to shorten the road to perfection for his
        individual self. How are we to render ourselves fit for that
        great imitation? What are the steps on the great ladder of
        perfection? These things have been discovered for us by the
        great sages of yore, and Patanjali’s little book is only a short
        and suggestive transcript of so much of our past experiences and
        future potentialities as is recorded in the book of nature. This
        little book uses the word <i>Yoga</i> in a double
        signification. The first is a state of the mind otherwise called
        <i>samadhi</i>; the second is a set of acts and observances that
        induce that state in the mind. The definition given by the sage
        is a negative one, and is applicable only on the plane of the
        mind. The source of the positive power lies in the higher
        principle; the soul <i>Yoga</i> (it is said) is the keeping in
        check of the five manifestations of the mind. The very wording
        of the definition is involved in the supposition of the
        existence of a power that can control and keep the mental
        manifestations in check. This power is familiar to us as freedom
        of the will. Although the soul is deluded by the manifestations
        of egoism (<i>asmita</i>) on the mental plane into regarding
        herself as a slave of the second and third principles, that is
        not the fact, and the awakening takes place as soon as the chord
        of egoism is slackened to a certain extent. This is the first
        step in the initiation by nature herself of the race of man. It
        is a matter of necessity. The side-by-side working with each
        other of the second and third and the fourth and fifth
        principles weakens the hold of natural mental <i>asmita</i>
        upon the soul. "I am these, or of these mental manifestations",
        says Egoism. Such a state of affairs, however, cannot last long.
        These manifestations are double in nature; the one is just the
        reverse of the other. Which of them is one with the ego: the
        unhappy or the blessed? No sooner is this question asked than
        the awakening takes place. It is impossible to answer any of
        these questions in the affirmative, and the soul naturally ends
        in discovering that she is a separate thing from the mind, and
        that although she has been the slave, she might be (what she
        naturally is) the Lord of the mind. Up to this time the soul has
        been tossed this way or that in obedience to the tatwic
        vibrations of the mind. Her blind sympathy with the mental
        manifestations gives her unison with the mind, and hence the
        tossing. The chord of sympathy is loosened by the waking. The
        stronger the nature, the greater the departure from unison.
        Instead of the soul being tossed by the mental vibrations, it is
        now time that the mind should vibrate in obedience to the
        vibrations of the soul. This assumption of lordship is the
        freedom of the will, and this obedience of the mind to the
        vibrations of the soul is <i>Yoga</i>. The manifestations
        evoked in the mind by the external <i>tatwas</i> must now give
        way to the stronger motion coming from the soul. By and bye the
        mental colors change their very nature, and the mind comes to
        coincide with the soul. In other words, the individual mental
        principle is neutralized, and the soul is free in her
        omniscience. </p>
      <p>Let us now trace the acquirements of the mind step by step up
        to <i>samadhi</i>. </p>
      <p><i>Samadhi</i>, or the mental state induced by the practice of
        <i>Yoga</i>, has two descriptions. As long as the mind is not
        perfectly absorbed in the soul the state is called <i>samprajnata</i>.
        That is the state in which the discovery of new truths follows
        labor in every department of nature. The second is the state of
        perfect mental absorption. It is called <i>asamprajnata</i>. In
        this there is no knowing, no discovering of unknown things. It
        is a state of intuitive omniscience. Two questions are naturally
        suggested at the awakening stage: </p>
      <p>"If I am these manifestations, which of them am I? I think I am
        none of them. What am I then? What are these?" </p>
      <p>The second question is solved in the <i>samprajnata samadhi</i>,
        the first in the other. Before entering further into the nature
        of <i>samadhi</i>, a word about habituation and apathy. These
        two are mentioned by Patanjali as the two means of checking
        mental manifestation, and it is very important to understand
        them thoroughly The manifestation of apathy is the reflection in
        the mind of the color of the soul when she becomes aware of her
        free nature and consequently is disgusted at the mastery of the
        passions. It is a necessary consequence of the awakening.
        Habituation is the repetition of the state so as to confirm it
        in the mind. </p>
      <p>The confirmation of the mind in this state means a state of
        ordinary mental inactivity. By this I mean that the five
        ordinary manifestations are at rest for the first time. This
        being so, the mind is for the time being left free to receive
        any influences. Here for the first time we see the influence of
        the soul in the shape of curiosity (<i>Vitarka</i>). What is
        this? What is that? How is this? How is that? This is the form
        in which curiosity shows itself in the mind. Curiosity is a
        desire to know, and a question is a manifestation of such a
        desire. But how does man become familiar with questions? The
        mental shape of curiosity and question will be understood easily
        by paying a little attention to the remarks I have made on the
        genesis of desire. The process of the birth of philosophical
        curiosity is similar to that of the birth of desire. In the
        latter the impulse comes from the external world through <i>Prana</i>,
        and in the former, directly from the soul. The place of pleasure
        in this is supplied by the reflection into the mind of the
        knowledge of the soul that self and independence are better than
        non-self and the enslaving cords thereof. The strength of the
        philosophical curiosity depends upon the strength of this
        reflection, and as this reflection is rather faint in the
        beginning (as it generally is in the present state of the
        spiritual development), the hold of philosophical curiosity upon
        the mind bears almost no comparison in strength with the hold of
        desire. </p>
      <p>Philosophical curiosity is then the first step of mental ascent
        towards <i>Yoga</i>. To begin with, we place before our mind
        every possible manifestation of nature, and try to fit in every
        possible phase of it with every related manifestation. In plain
        language, it is to apply ourselves to the investigation of all
        the branches of natural science one by one. </p>
      <p>This is the natural result of curiosity. By this attempt to
        discover the relations already existing or possible, essential
        or potential, among the phenomena of nature, another power is
        induced in the mind. Patanjali calls this power <i>vichara</i>,
        meditation. The radical idea of the word is to go among the
        various relations of the portions that make up the whole subject
        of our contemplation. It is only a deeper hold on the mind of
        the philosophical curiosity noticed above. The third state of
        this <i>samadhi</i> is what is called <i>ananda</i>, happiness
        or bliss. As long as there is curiosity or meditation, the mind
        is only assuming the consistency of the soul. This means to say
        that as yet the vibrations of the soul are only making way into
        the mind; they have not yet entirely succeeded. When the third
        stage is arrived at, however, the mind is sufficiently polished
        to receive the full and clear image of the sixth coil. The mind
        is conscious of this image as bliss. Every man who has devoted
        himself to the study of nature has been in that coveted state
        for however short a time. It is very difficult to make it
        intelligible by description, but I am sure that the majority of
        my readers are not strangers to it. </p>
      <p>But whence does this bliss come? What is it? I have called it a
        reflection of the soul. But first of all, what is the soul? From
        what I have written up to this time, the reader will no doubt
        surmise that I understand the soul to be only a picture of the
        gross body, the <i>prana</i>, and the mind, so far only as its
        constitution is concerned. </p>
      <p>I have mentioned that in the macrocosm the sun is in the
        center, the <i>prana</i> the atmosphere of the second
        principle, and that the ecliptic marks the shape of this
        principle. I have also mentioned that the individual human
        principle is only a picture of this macrocosmic whole. I have
        mentioned again that in the macrocosm <i>virat</i> is the
        center and <i>manu</i> the atmosphere of second principle. This
        atmosphere is made of the five universal <i>tatwas</i>, just
        like <i>prana</i>, the only difference being that the mental <i>tatwas</i>
        undergo a greater number of vibrations per second than the <i>tatwas</i>
        of <i>prana</i>. I have also said that the individual mind is
        an exact picture of the macrocosmic mind, the aspect differing
        with the surroundings of time, just as in the case of <i>prana</i>.
      </p>
      <p>Now I have to say the same with regard to the soul. In the
        macrocosm there is <i>Brahma</i> for the center, and <i>vijana</i>
        for the atmosphere of this principle. As the earth moves in <i>prana</i>,
        as the sun moves in <i>manu</i>, as the <i>manu</i> (or <i>virat</i>)
        breathes in <i>vijana</i>, so the soul breathes in the highest
        atmosphere of <i>ananda</i>. <i>Brahma</i> is the center of
        spiritual life, as the sun is the center of <i>prana</i>, and <i>virat</i>
        the center of mental life. These centers are similar in
        luminosity to the sun, but ordinary senses cannot perceive them
        because the number of tatwic vibrations per second is beyond
        their power. </p>
      <p>The soul of the universe (the <i>vijana maya kosha</i>), with
        <i>Brahma</i> for its center, is our psychic ideal. </p>
      <p>The tatwic wires of this sphere extend over what we call a <i>Brahmanda</i>.
        This they do in a way similar to the tatwic rays of <i>prana</i>
        with which we are familiar through the medium of gross matter.
        This center with this universe forms the self-conscious
        universe. All the lower centers exist within the bosom of this
        atmosphere. </p>
      <p>Under the influence of gross matter the mental macrocosm
        registers the external pictures; that is to say, it gains the
        power of manifesting itself in the five ways I have described in
        the essay on mind. Under the <i>Brahma</i>, however, the mental
        macrocosm (<i>Manu</i>) attains the higher powers under
        discussion. This double influence changes, after a time, the
        nature of <i>Manu</i> itself. The universe has, as it were, a
        new mind after every <i>manwantara</i>. This change is always
        for the better. The mind is ever spiritualizing. The later the <i>Manu</i>
        the more spiritual. A time will come when the present
        macrocosmic mind will be entirely absorbed into the soul. The
        same is the case with the microcosm of man. Thus <i>Brahma</i>
        is by nature omniscient. He is conscious of a self. The types of
        everything that was or is to be in the process of time are but
        so many varying compositions of his <i>tatwas</i>. Every phase
        of the universe, with its antecedents and consequents, is in
        him. It is himself, his own self-consciousness. One mind is
        absorbed in him in the space of fourteen <i>manwantara</i>. The
        motion of the mental tatwas is so much accelerated that they
        become spiritual. By the time that this takes place in the
        Universe the vibrations of the <i>tatwas</i> of <i>prana</i>
        too are being accelerated under the influence of <i>Manu</i>
        until the <i>prana</i> itself is turned into the <i>Manu</i>
        of the next period. And again, while this is being done, the
        gross matter is similarly developing itself into <i>prana</i>.
      </p>
      <p>This is the process of involution, but for the present let us
        leave it here and resume the subject. </p>
      <p>The human soul is an exact picture of this macrocosmic
        principle. It is omniscient like its prototype, and has the same
        constitution. But the omniscience of the human soul is yet
        latent on account of her forgetfulness. The sixth principle
        (absolute) has developed only a little. Humanity in general has
        only a very dim notion of infinity, of Godhead, and of all such
        subjects. This means that the rays of the infinite are only just
        evoking our sixth principle into active life at this stage of
        our progress. When in the process of time the rays of the
        infinite gather sufficient strength, our soul will come out in
        her true light. We might accelerate this process by <i>vairagya</i>
        (apathy), which gives strength to <i>Yoga</i>, as we have seen.
      </p>
      <p>The means of strengthening <i>Yoga</i> deserve separate
        consideration. Some of them help to remove those influences and
        forces that are antagonistic to progress; others, such as the
        contemplation of the divine principle, accelerate the process of
        development of the human soul, and the consequent absorption of
        the mind in the soul. At present I have simply to discover the
        nature of the blissful <i>samadhi</i>, which I spoke of as
        being caused by the reflection of the soul in the mind. </p>
      <p>This reflection simply means the assumption by the mind of the
        state of the soul. The mind passes from its own ordinary state
        to the state of the higher energy of the soul. The greater
        number of tatwic vibrations per second make their way in the
        matter of a lower number of tatwic vibrations per second. The
        English language recognizes this rising up of the mind, this
        passing out of itself, as elation, and this is the meaning of
        the word <i>ananda</i> as qualifying the third state of the <i>samprajnata




          samadhi</i>. The <i>ananda maya kosha</i> takes its name from
        its being the state of the highest upheaval. Every moment of <i>ananda</i>
        is a step towards the absorption of the mind as it changes its
        nature, passing forever into a higher state of consistency. That
        state which in <i>ananda</i> only appeared in the moment of
        triumph now becomes part and parcel of the mind. This
        confirmation of the higher energy is known by the name of <i>Asmita</i>,
        which may be translated by the word egoism, but means making
        part and parcel of self. </p>
      <p><a name="xiii"></a><b><font size="+1">XIII. <i>Yoga</i> (II) ~</font></b>
      </p>
      <p>The object in view in this article is to mark the stages along
        the road of mental matter to its final absorption in the soul.
        In the last essay I brought the mind to the state of <i>samprajnata



          samadhi</i>. It is in this state that the mind acquires the
        power of discovering new truths, and seeing new combinations of
        things existent. As this state has been attained in the long
        cycle of bygone ages, man has acquired a knowledge of science to
        its present stage of development, and the attainment of this
        quantum of knowledge has been the means of raising our minds to
        our present pitch of perfection, when we have learned to say
        that these great powers are native to the human mind. As I have
        shown, these powers have become native to the mind only after
        long submission of the mind to the influence of the soul. </p>
      <p>By the constant exercise of this <i>samadhi</i> the mind
        learns to incline towards those cosmic influences that are in
        their very nature antagonistic to those bad powers of our
        constitution that check our progress. These powers tend to die
        out naturally. The ultimate goal of this march is that the state
        of mind when its manifestation become entirely potential. The
        soul, if she pleases, might propel them by her inherent power
        into the domain of the actual, but they lose all power to draw
        the soul after them. </p>
      <p>When this state is reached, or when it is about to be reached,
        certain powers begin to show themselves in the mind, which in
        the present cycle are by no means common. This state is
        technically called <i>paravairagya</i>, or the Higher Apathy. </p>
      <p>The word <i>vairagya</i> usually is rendered into English as
        apathy, and is looked upon with disfavor by modern thinkers.
        This is, I believe, owing to a misconception of the meaning of
        the word. It is generally understood that misanthropy is the
        only indication, or perhaps the highest perfection, of this
        mental state. Nothing can be further from the intention of those
        sages who put <i>vairagya</i> down as the highest means of the
        attainment of bliss. <i>Vairagya</i> or apathy is defined by
        Vyasa in his commentary on <i>The Aphorisms of Yoga</i> as the
        "final state of perfected knowledge". It is that state in which
        the mind, coming to know the real nature of things, would no
        longer be deluded into false pleasure by the manifestations of <i>avidya</i>.
        When this upward inclination becomes confirmed, when this habit
        of soaring towards the divine becomes second nature, the name of
        <i>paravairagya</i> is given to the complementary mental state.
      </p>
      <p>This state is reached in many ways, and the road is marked by
        many clearly defined stages. One way is the practice of <i>samprajnata




          samadhi</i>. By the constant practice of this <i>samadhi</i>,
        to which the mind runs of itself when it once tastes the bliss
        of the fourth stage of that state, the mind is habituated to a
        state of faith in the efficacy of the pursuit. This faith is
        nothing more than a state of mental lucidity in which the yet
        unknown truths of nature begin to throw their shadows before
        them. The mind begins to feel truth in any and every place, and
        drawn by the taste of bliss (<i>ananda</i>), sets to work out
        the process of its evolution with greater and greater zeal. This
        faith has been called <i>Sraddha</i> by Patanjali, and he calls
        the consequent zeal <i>Virya</i>. </p>
      <p>Confirmed in this zeal and working on, the manifestation of
        memory comes in naturally. This is a high state of evolution.
        Every truth becomes present before the mind’s eye at the
        slightest thought, and the four stages of <i>samadhi</i> make
        their appearance again and again till the mind becomes very
        nearly a mirror of Nature. </p>
      <p>This corresponds to the state of <i>paravairagya</i>, which in
        the second place would also be attained by the contemplation of
        the High Prototype of the Soul. This is the <i>Iswara</i> of
        Ptanjali, the macrocosmic soul that remains forever in that
        entity’s soul of pristine purity. It is this <i>Iswara</i> of
        that I have spoken as the self-conscious universe. </p>
      <p>This <i>Iswara</i>, as I conceive it, is only a macrocosmic
        center, similar in nature to the sun, though higher in function.
      </p>
      <p>As the sun with his ocean of <i>Prana</i> is the prototype of
        our life-principle, <i>prana maya kosha</i>, so <i>Iswara</i>
        is the great prototype of our souls. What is the sixth principle
        of not only a phase of the existence of this great being
        prolonged as a separate phase into the lower principles, yet
        destined to emerge again into its own true self? Just as I have
        shown that the principles of life live in the sun after our
        terrestrial death, to recur again and again into actual life, so
        too the soul lives in the <i>Iswara</i> in a similar fashion.
        We may look upon this entity as being the group of all the
        liberated souls, but at the same time we must remember that the
        unliberated souls also are his undeveloped reflections, destined
        in the long run to attain their original state. It is therefore
        necessary to assume the independent existence of <i>Iswara</i>,
        and of other souls in <i>Iswara</i>. </p>
      <p>This macrocosmic psychic center, this ideal of the sixth
        principle in man, is the great reservoir of every actual force
        in the universe. He is the true type of the perfection of the
        human soul. The incidents of mental and physical existence
        which, however perfect in themselves, are to His more
        comprehensive nature mere imperfections, find no place in Him.
        There is no misery for Him -- the five comprehensive miseries of
        Patanjali are enumerated above -- for misery can arise only in
        the retrograde process of the first awakening of the mind, only
        being caused by sensation, and the human sixth principle not yet
        gaining sufficient strength in the process of time to draw the
        mind towards itself and out of the domain of the senses, to make
        it what its prototype originally is, the rod of dominion, and
        not as sensation has made it, the instrument of slavery. </p>
      <p>By this conemplation of the sixth principle of the Universe, a
        sympathy is established naturally between it and the human soul.
        That sympathy is only necessary for the Universal Tatwic Law to
        work with greater effect. The human soul begins to be cleansed
        of the dust of the world and in its turn affects the mind in a
        similar way, and therein the <i>yogi</i> becomes conscious of
        this influence by the slackening of the fetters forged by <i>Prakriti</i>,
        and a daily, hourly strengthening of heavenward aspirations. </p>
      <p>The human soul then begins to become a center of power for its
        own little universe, just as <i>Iswara</i> is the center of
        power in His universe. The microcosm then becomes a perfect
        little picture of the macrocosm. When perfection is attained,
        all the mental and physiological tatwas of the microcosm, and to
        a certain extent of the surrounding world, become the slaves of
        the soul. Whitherso it may incline, the tatwas are at its back.
        He may will, and the atmospheric <i>Vayu tatwa</i>, with any
        amount of strength he pleases or is capable of centering, will
        set in motion any piece of furniture within the reach of his
        will. He may will, and at the instant the apas tatwa will slake
        your thirst, cure your fever, or in fact wash off the germs of
        any disease. He may will, and any and every <i>tatwa</i> on
        either of the lower planes will do its work for him. These high
        powers do not wait to come in all of a sudden, but show
        themselves gradually, and according to the special aptitudes in
        special forms. </p>
      <p>But a description of these powers is not my present business.
        My only purpose is to show in what way, according to the
        universal law of nature, by contemplation of the macrocosmic
        sixth principle, that the human soul becomes the means for the
        mind attaining the state called <i>paravairagya</i>. </p>
      <p>Besides these two, the author of <i>The Aphorisms of Yoga</i>
        enumerates five more ways in which the minds of those who are
        already by the power of previous <i>karma</i> inclined towards
        the divine, are seen to work out their way to the sate of <i>paravairagya</i>.
      </p>
      <p>This first way is the habituating of the mind to the
        manifestations of pleasure, sympathy, elation, and pity toward
        the comfortable, the miserable, and the vicious respectively.
        Every good man will tell us that the manifestation of joy at the
        comfort of another is a high virtue. Why, what harm is there in
        jealousy? I think no other science except the philosophy of the
        <i>tatwas</i> explains with any amount of satisfaction the
        reason why of such questions. </p>
      <p>We have seen that in a state of enjoyment, comfort, pleasure,
        satisfaction, and the like, the <i>prithivi</i> or the apas
        tatwa prevails in the <i>prana</i> and the mind. It is evident
        that if we put our minds in the same, we induce either of the
        two tatwas in our life and mental principles. What will be the
        result? A process of purification will set in. Both the
        principles will being to be cleansed of any trace of defect that
        the excess of any remaining <i>tatwas</i> may have given to our
        constitution. </p>
      <p>All those physiological or mental causes that induce
        inattention in the mind are removed. Bodily distempers take
        their leave for they are the result of the disturbance of the
        balance of the physiological <i>tatwas</i>, and comfort,
        pleasure and enjoyment are foreign to these. The one induces the
        other. As the balance of the <i>tatwas</i> brings comfort and
        enjoyment of life, so the sense of comfort and enjoyment that
        colors our <i>prana</i> and mind when we put ourselves in
        sympathy with the comfortable, restores the balance of our <i>tatwas</i>.
      </p>
      <p>And when the balance of <i>tatwas</i> is restored, what
        remains? Disinclination to work, doubt, laziness and other
        feelings of that kind can no longer stand, and the only result
        is the restoration of the mind to perfect calmness. As Vyasa
        says in his commentary, the White Law makes its appearance in
        the mind. Such and in a similar way is the result of the
        manifestation of the other qualities. But for such a result to
        beachieved, there must be long and powerful application. </p>
      <p>The next method is <i>Pranayama</i>, deep expiration and
        inspiration. This too conduces to the same end and in the same
        way. The drawing of deep breaths in and out has to some extent
        the same effect as running and other hard exercise. The heat
        that is produced burns down certain elements of disease, which
        if it desirable should be burnt. But the practice in its effects
        differs for the better from hard exercise. In hard exercise the
        <i>susumna</i> begins to play, and that is not good for
        physiological health. <i>Pranayama</i>, if properly performed,
        however, is beneficial from a physiological as well as from a
        mental point of view. The first effect that is produced in <i>pranayama</i>
        is the general prevalence of the <i>prithivi tatwa</i>. It is
        unnecessary to remind the reader that the <i>apas tatwa</i>
        carries the breath lowest down, and that the <i>Prithivi</i> is
        the next. In our attempt to draw deeper breaths than usual, the
        <i>prithivi tatwa</i> cannot but be introduced, and the general
        prevalence of this <i>tatwa</i>, with the consequent golden
        tinge of the circle of light round our heads, can never fail to
        cause fixity of purpose and strength of attention. The <i>apas
          tatwa</i> comes in next. This is the silvery hue of innocence
        that encircles the head of a saint and marks the attainment of <i>paravairagya</i>.
      </p>
      <p>The next is the attainment of the two-fold lucidity -- the
        sensuous and the cardiac. The sensuous lucidity is the power of
        the senses to perceive the changes of <i>prana</i>. The
        previously trained attention, according to special aptitudes, is
        centered on any one of the five senses or more. If centered in
        the eyes, one can see the physiological and atmospheric colors
        of <i>prana</i>. I can affirm this by personal experience. I
        can see the various colors of the seasons. I can see the rain
        coming an hour, two hours, and sometimes even two days before an
        actual shower. Bright sheets of the green washed into coolness
        and purity by the white make their appearance anywhere about me
        -- in the room, in the heavens, on the table before me, on the
        wall in front. When this happens, I am sure that rain is in the
        air and will come down soon. If the green is streaked with red,
        it takes some time to come, but it is surely preparing. </p>
      <p>These remarks are enough for color. The power can be made to
        show itself by a sustained attempt to look into space, or
        anything else, as the moon, a star, a jewel, and so on. The
        remaining four senses also attain similar powers, and sounds,
        smells, tastes and touches that ordinary humanity cannot
        perceive begin to be perceived by the <i>Yogi</i>. </p>
      <p>The cardiac lucidity is the power of the mind to feel and also
        that of the senses to perceive thoughts. In the article on <i>Prana</i>,
        I have given a chart of the head, specifying the places and
        giving the colors of the various kinds of mental manifestations.
        These colors are seen by anyone who has or acquires the power,
        and they constitute the surest book in which to read the
        thoughts of any man. By sustained practice one will recognize
        the finest shades. </p>
      <p>One can also feel these thoughts. The modifications of thought
        moving along the universal tatwic wires affect any and every
        man. They each impart a distinct impulse to the <i>prana maya
          kosha</i>, and thus a distinguishable impulse to the throbs of
        the brain and the more easily perceivable throbs of the heart. A
        man who studies these throbs of the heart and sits with his
        attention centered into the heart (while it is of course open to
        every influence) learns to feel every influence there. The
        effect on the heart of the mental modifications of other people
        is a fact that, so far as quality is concerned, may be verified
        by the commonest experience. </p>
      <p>This sensuous or cardiac lucidity, as the case may be, once
        attained kills skepticism, and in the end conduces to the state
        of <i>paravairagya</i>. </p>
      <p>In the next place, says Patanjali, one may rely upon the
        knowledge obtainable through dreams and sleep. But this will do
        for the present. </p>
      <p><a name="xiv"></a><b><font size="+1">XIV. <i>Yoga</i> The Soul
            (III) ~</font></b> </p>
      <p>The five ethereal currents of sensation are focused in the
        brain, and motion is transmitted to the mental principle from
        these five centers of force. These various foci serve a
        connecting links between the mental and the life-principles. The
        visual currents produce in the mind the capability of becoming
        conscious of color. In other words, they produce eyes in the
        mind. Similarly, the mind gets the capability of receiving the
        impressions of the four remaining sensations. This capability is
        acquired after the exposure of ages. Cycles upon cycles pass,
        and the mind is not yet capable of receiving these tatwic
        vibrations. The wave of life begins its organized journey upon
        earth with vegetable forms. Since that time external currents
        begin to affect the vegetable organism, and this is the
        beginning of what we call sensation. The modifications of the
        external tatwas through the individualized vegetable life strike
        the chords of the latent mind, but it will not yet respond. It
        is not in sympathy. Higher and higher through vegetable forms
        the life-wave travels; greater and greater is the force with
        which it strikes the mental chords, and better and better is the
        capability of that principle to respond to the tatwic calls of
        life. When we reach the animal kingdom the external tatwic foci
        are just visible. These are the sensuous organs, each of which
        has the capability of focusing its own peculiar tatwic rays into
        itself. In the lowest forms of animal life they are just
        visible, and this is a sign that the mental principle is then in
        a comparatively high state of perfection: it has begun to
        respond somewhat to the external tatwic call. It might be
        remarked here that this is the superposed relative mind, and not
        the absolute original mental <i>truti</i>, both of which I have
        already described. It is the uprising of this evolutionary
        finite structure on all the planes of life that has led a German
        philosopher to the conclusion that God is Becoming. This is true
        of course, but it is only true of the finite Universe of names
        and forms and not of the absolute towards which it is moving. </p>
      <p>To resume: The exposure of this animal life to the external
        tatwas is longer and longer, and the strength becomes greater
        and greater in their various foci, the formation of these foci
        becomes higher and higher, the external call upon the mind is
        stronger and stronger, and the mental response is more and more
        perfect. A time comes in the progress of this mental evolution
        when the five mental senses are perfectly developed, as is
        marked by the development of the external senses. We call the
        action of the five mental senses the phenomenon of perception.
        On the manifestation of this perception is raised the mighty
        fabric of perception of those mental manifestations that I have
        discussed in the essay on Mind. The way in which this evolution
        takes place is sketched there too. </p>
      <p>The external tatwas of gross matter create gross foci in a
        gross body from whence to send their currents. The soul does the
        same. The tatwic currents of the external soul, <i>Iswara</i>,
        create similar centers of action in connection with the mind.
        But the tatwic vibrations of the soul are finer than those of
        the life-principle. The mental matter takes a longer time to
        respond to the call of <i>Iswara</i> than it does to answer to
        the call of <i>Prana</i>. It is not till the life-wave reaches
        humanity that the vibrations of the soul begin to show
        themselves in the mind. The foci of psychic currents are located
        in what is called the <i>vijnana maya kosha</i>, the psychic
        coil. At the time of the beginning of human life, the psychic
        foci go on gaining strength, race after race, till we reach the
        point that I have called the awakening of the soul. That process
        ends in the confirmation of the state of <i>paravairagya</i>.
        From this state there are only a few steps to the power of what
        has been called ulterior or psychic perception. Our former
        perception may now be called animal perception. And just as the
        mighty fabric of inference and verbal authority has been raised
        on the basis of animal perception, a more mighty fabric of
        inference and verbal authority has been raised on the basis of
        psychic perception by ancient Aryan sages. We shall come to that
        by and bye. </p>
      <p>As practice confirms the state of <i>paravairagya</i> in the <i>Yogi</i>’s
mind,




        it gets the most perfect calm. It is open to all sorts of tatwic
        influences, without any sensuous disturbance. The next power
        that consequently shows itself is called <i>samapatti</i>. I
        define this word as that mental state in which it becomes
        capable of receiving the reflection of the subjective and the
        objective worlds, and the means of knowledge at the slightest
        motion, however imparted. </p>
      <p>Intuition has four stages: (1) <i>Sa vitarka</i>, verbal, (2)
        <i>Nir vitarka</i>, wordless, (3) <i>Sa vichara</i>,
        meditative, (4) <i>Nir vichara</i>, ultra-meditative. </p>
      <p>The state of intuition has been likened to a bright, pure,
        transparent, colorless crystal. Place whatever you will behind
        such a crystal, and it will show itself in the color of that
        object. And so does the mind behave in this state. Let the
        tatwic rays that constitute the objective world fall on it, and
        it shows itself in the colors of the objective world. Remove
        these colors, and it is again as pure as crystal, ready to show
        in itself any other colors that might be presented to it. Think
        of the elementary forces of Nature, the <i>tatwa</i>, think of
        the gross objects where they work, think of the organs of sense
        and their genesis and the method of their operations, think of
        the soul, liberated or bound, and the mind readily falls into
        each of these states. It retains no particular color that might
        oppose or vitiate any other color entering it. The first stage
        of intuition is verbal. It is the most common in this age and
        therefore the most easily intelligible. Let the reader think of
        a mind in which no color is evoked at the sound of scientific
        words. Let him think of thousands of those men in whose minds
        the sounds of their own language, full of high and great ideas,
        is as strange as Hebrew. Take an uneducated English peasant and
        teach him to read Comus. Do you think those beautiful words will
        carry to him all they are intended to convey? But why an
        uneducated peasant? Did the great Johnson himself understand the
        beauties of Milton? Take again a common schoolboy, and read to
        him in his own language the truths of philosophy. Does that
        language, even if you gave him its lexicographic meaning, convey
        any idea to his mind? Take the <i>Upanishad</i>, and read it to
        any <i>pandit</i> who can understand Sanskrit reasonably well.
        Does anyone doubt (I do not) that he does not understand all
        that those noble words convey? With such a mind, let him compare
        the mind of a really educated man, a mind that almost
        intuitively takes in the true sense of words. To take in the
        full sense that words are intended to convey is not an easy
        task, even for the highly educated. Prejudice, deep-seated
        antagonistic theories, the strength of one’s own convictions,
        and perhaps some other characteristics of the mind prove to be
        an insurmountable obstacle. Even a John Stuart Mill could not
        properly understand the philosophy of Sir William Hamilton. One
        of the greatest Oriental scholars says that Patanjali’s system
        is no philosophy at all! Another has expressed himself to the
        effect that Patanjali’s <i>Aphorisms on Yoga</i> are mere
        fanaticism! There are many <i>tantras</i> of which, though we
        might translate them into any language, very few of us really
        know the meaning. This is a very grave shortcoming, and
        sometimes much to be regretted. It disappears only with the
        manifestation of verbal intuition. In this state the <i>Yogi</i>
        is at once <i>en rapport</i> with the author of the book, and
        this is because his mind is free from every blinding prejudice,
        and is in fact a pure, bright, colorless crystal, ready to show
        any phase of color that might come in contact with it. </p>
      <p>The next stage of intuition is wordless. In this you no longer
        stand in need of books to initiate yourself into the secrets of
        nature. Your mind becomes capable of serving these truths from
        their fountainhead: true pictures of everything in every state
        of the objective word which through the agency of <i>prana</i>
        are represented in the universal mind, pictures that are the
        souls of these things, their own true selves, pregnant with
        every state in which the thing has passed, or has to pass, the
        realities of the various and varying phases of the phenomenal
        world, the thing which in a table, a glass, a pen, and in fact
        any and every thing, is hard or soft, long or short, white or
        black. </p>
      <p>These state have for their object the gross phenomenal world.
        The next two stages of intuition have for their object the world
        of forces that lies at the root of the changes of the gross
        world, the world of subtle bodies. The meditative intuition has
        for its object only the present manifestation of the currents of
        the subtle body, the forces that are already showing or going to
        show themselves. In this state, for example, the <i>Yogi</i>
        knows intuitively the present forces of the atmospheric <i>Prana</i>
        as they are gathering strength enough to give us a shower of
        rain or snow, but he does not know what has given them their
        present activity, or whether the potential will ever become the
        actual, and if yes, to what extent. He knows the forces that are
        working at the present moment in that tree, that horse, that
        man, the powers that keep these things in the state they are in,
        but he does not know the antecedents and consequents of that
        state. </p>
      <p>The next state has for its object all the three states of
        subtle bodies. The present state is know of course, but with it
        the <i>Yogi</i> draws in the whole history of the object from
        beginning to end. Place before him a rose, and he knows its
        subtle principle in all this states, antecedents and
        consequents. He is familiar with the little beginnings of the
        bush and its growth in various stages; he knows how the budding
        began, how the bud opened, and how it grows into a beautiful
        flower. He knows what its end shall be, and when. Put before him
        a closed letter, and he knows not only what that letter
        contains, but he can trace those thoughts to the brain whence
        they proceeded, to the hand that wrote the letter, to the room
        in which they were written, and so on. It is in this state too
        that the mind knows mind, without the medium of words. </p>
      <p>These four states constitute what is called the objective
        trance (<i>savija samadhi</i>). </p>
      <p>Occasionally these powers show themselves in many minds. But
        that simply shows that the favored mortal is on the right track.
        He must make sure of the point if he would win. </p>
      <p>When the last stage of this <i>samadhi</i> is confirmed in the
        mind, our psychic senses gain the power of that amount of
        certain knowledge which is the portion of our animal senses. The
        authority of these senses is supreme with us, so far as the
        gross world is concerned. In a similar way there is no room left
        for us to doubt the truth of the knowledge that our psychic
        senses bring us. The high power of knowing every supersensuous
        truth with perfect certainty is known as <i>Ritambhara</i>, or
        psychic perception. </p>
      <p>The knowledge that psychic perception gives us is by no means
        to be confounded with the knowledge obtained through inference,
        imagination, or the records of others’ experience. </p>
      <p>Inference, imagination, and verbal authority, based on animal
        perception, can only work upon knowledge obtained through animal
        senses. But psychic perception and inference based upon that has
        for its object things of the supersensuous world, the realities
        that underlie the phenomenal existence with which we are
        familiar. That perception takes in the fact of the existence and
        the nature of <i>Prakriti</i>, the most subtle state of matter,
        just as animal perception takes in gross matter. </p>
      <p>Animal perception draws the mind towards gross matter, the
        world that has given it birth. So does psychic perception draw
        the mind towards the soul. The practice of objective <i>samadhi</i>
        destroys itself. The mind takes in so much of the higher energy
        of the soul that it loses its mental consistency. Down goes the
        entire structure of unreal names and forms. The soul lives in
        herself, and not in the mind as now. </p>
      <p>With this the greater part of my work is done. It is now clear
        that what we call man lives chiefly in the mind. The mind has
        two entities to affect it. The one is the life-principle, the
        other the psychic principle, the once producing certain changes
        in the mind from below, the other from above. These changes have
        been recorded, and it has been found that the dominion of the
        soul is more desirable than that of the life principle. When the
        mind loses itself entirely in the soul, man becomes God. </p>
      <p>The object of these essays has been roughly to portray the
        nature, function and mutual relation of the principles; in other
        words, to trace the operation of the universal tatwic law on all
        the planes of existence. This has been briefly done. A good deal
        more remains to be said about the powers latent in the <i>Prana</i>
        and the mind, which show themselves in special departments of
        the progress of man. That need not, however, form part of the
        present series, and therefore I close this series with some
        description of the first and last principle of the cosmos: the
        Spirit. </p>
      <p><a name="xv"></a><b><font size="+1">XV. The Spirit ~</font></b>
      </p>
      <p>This is the <i>anandamaya kosha</i>, literally the coil of
        bliss of the Vedantins. With the power of psychic perception,
        the soul knows the existence of this entity, but in the present
        stage of human development it has hardly made its presence
        directly felt in the human constitution. The characteristic
        difference between the soul and the spirit is the absence of the
        "I" in the latter. </p>
      <p>It is the dawn of the day of evolution. It is the first
        setting-in of the positive current of the great breath. It is
        the first state of cosmic activity after the night of <i>Mahapralaya</i>.
        As we have seen, the breath in every state of existence has
        three states: the positive, the negative, and the <i>susumna</i>.
        The susumna is pregnant with either of the two states. This is
        the state that is described in the <i>Parameshthi sukta</i> of
        the <i>Rig Veda</i> as neither <i>Sat</i> (positive) nor <i>Asat</i>
        (negative). This is the primary state of <i>parabrahma</i>, in
        which the whole universe lies hidden like a tree in the seed. As
        billows rise and lose themselves in an ocean, the two states of
        evolution and involution take their rise in this state, and in
        due time are lost in the same. What is <i>Prakriti</i> itself
        in this state of potential omnipotence? The phenomena of <i>Prakriti</i>
        owe their origin and existence to the modifications of the great
        breath. When that great breath is in the state of <i>susumna</i>,
        can we not say that <i>Prakriti</i> itself is held in that
        state by <i>susumna</i>? It is in fact <i>parabrahma</i> that
        is all in all. <i>Prakriti</i> is only the shadow of that
        substance, and like a shadow it follows the modifications of His
        great breath. The first modification of the great breath is the
        setting in of the evolutionary (positive) current) In this
        state, <i>Prakriti</i> is ready to modify into the ethers of
        the first degree, which make up the atmosphere from which <i>Iswara</i>
        draws life. In the first state of evolution, the Subject (<i>parabrahma</i>)
        whose breath causes these modifications of <i>Prakriti</i>, is
        known as <i>Sat</i>, the fountainhead of all existence. The I
        is latent in this state. Naturally enough, because it is the
        differentiation that gives birth to the I. But what is this
        state? Must man be annihilated before he reaches this state of
        what from the standpoint of man is called <i>nirvana</i> or <i>paranirvana</i>?
        There is no reason to suppose that it is the state of
        annihilation any more than a certain amount of latent heat is
        annihilated in water. The simple fact is that the color that
        constitutes the ego becomes latent in the spirit’s higher form
        of energy. It is a state of consciousness or knowledge above
        self, not certainly destroying it. </p>
      <p>The individual spirit bears the same relation to the <i>Sat</i>
        which the individual soul bears to the <i>Iswara</i>, the
        individual mind to the <i>Virat</i>, and the individual
        life-principle to the <i>Prana</i>. Each center is given birth
        to by the tatwic rays of that degree. Each is a drop in its own
        ocean. The <i>Upanishad</i> explains this state under many
        names. The <i>Chhandogva,</i> however, has a very comprehensive
        dialogue on this subject between Uddalaka and his son
        Shwetakete. </p>
      <p>Professor Max Muller has made some very questionable remarks on
        certain assertions in this dialogue, calling them "more or less
        fanciful". These remarks could never have fallen from so learned
        a man had he known and understood something of the ancient
        Science of Breath and the Philosophy of the Tatwas. The <i>Upanishad</i>
        can never be very intelligible without this comprehensive
        science. It must be remembered that the <i>Upanishads</i>
        themselves have in many places clearly laid down that a teacher
        is wanted for the proper understanding of these divine words.
        Now the teacher taught nothing else but the Science of Breath,
        which is said to be the secret doctrine of all secret doctrines.
        It is, in fact, the key to all that is taught in the <i>Upanishad</i>.
        The little book that tries to explain these essays to the world
        appears from its very arrangement to be a compilation of various
        couplets on the same subject, inherited from various esoteric
        circles. In fact, this handful of stanzas has its chief value as
        a key to Aryan philosophy and occult science, but even this
        little book will hardly serve to dispel the gloom of ages. </p>
      <p>To return, however, to the dialogue between the father and the
        son: it is contained in the sixth <i>Prapathaka</i> of the <i>Chhandogya




          Upanishad</i>. </p>
      <p>"In the beginning, my dear, there was only that which is one
        only, without a second. Others say in the beginning there was
        that only, which is not one only, without a second, and from
        which is not, that which is was born." </p>
      <p>This is the translation of Professor max Muller.
        Notwithstanding the authority of his great name, and real
        scholarship, I venture to think that the sense of the <i>Upanishad</i>
        is totally lost sight of in this translation. The words of the
        original are: </p>
      <p>"<i>Sad eva saumyedamagre asit</i>." </p>
      <p>I cannot find any word in the translation giving the sense of
        the word idam in the original. <i>Idam</i> means "this", and it
        has been explained as meaning the phenomenal world. This that is
        perceived, etc. Therefore real translation of the text would be:
      </p>
      <p>"This (world) was <i>Sat</i> alone in the beginning." </p>
      <p>Perhaps in the translation of Professor Muller the word "there"
        is printed by mistake for "this". If this is the case, the
        defect in the translation is at once cured. </p>
      <p>The text means that the first state of the world before
        differentiation was the state known as <i>Sat</i>. From what
        comes afterwards, it appears that this is the state of the
        Universe in which all its phenomena, material, mental and
        psychic, are held <i>in posse</i>. The word <i>eva</i>, which
        in the translation stands for the word "alone" or "only",
        signifies that in the beginning of the Day of Evolution the
        universe had not all the five, or even two or more of the five
        planes of existence together. Now such is the case, but in the
        beginning the <i>Sat</i> existed alone. </p>
      <p>The <i>Sat</i> is one only, without a second. There is no
        qualification of time in these two epithets. The <i>Sat</i> is
        one alone, not like the <i>Prana</i>, the <i>Virat</i>, and <i>Iswara</i>,
        having all three existing simultaneously, a shadowy side of
        existence. </p>
      <p>The next sentence goes on to say that in the beginning there
        was <i>Asat</i> alone. As Professor Muller renders it, "There
        [?] was that only which is not." </p>
      <p>Now this carries no meaning, notwithstanding the Greek
        accompaniment. That the word <i>Asat</i> is used in the sense
        of "that which is not" or briefly "nothing", there is no doubt.
        But there is also no doubt that such is not the meaning of the <i>Upanishad</i>.
        The words are used here in the same sense in which they are used
        in the "<i>Nosad asit</i>" hymn of the <i>Rigveda</i>. </p>
      <p>"Then there was neither the <i>Sat</i> nor the <i>Asat</i>."
      </p>
      <p>This of course is a state quite other than the <i>Sat</i> of
        the <i>Upanishad</i>. It is nothing more than the <i>susumna</i>
        of the Brahmic breath. After this in the beginning of evolution
        the <i>Brahma </i>became <i>Sat</i>. This is the positive
        potential phase. The <i>Asat</i> is nothing more than the
        cooler negative life current that rules during the night of <i>Maha




          pralaya</i>. When the shadowy <i>Prakriti</i> has undergone
        the preparatory influence of the negative current, the day of
        evolution sets in with the beginning of the positive current.
        The dispute as to beginning is merely of a technical nature. In
        reality there is no beginning. It is all a motion in the circle,
        and from this point of view we may put whatever state we like in
        the beginning. </p>
      <p>But the <i>Asat</i> philosopher argues that unless the <i>Maya</i>
        undergo the preparatory influence of the Night, there can be no
        creation. Hence, according to him, we must put <i>Asat</i> at
        the beginning. </p>
      <p>The sage Uddalaka would not consent to this. According to him,
        the active impressive force is in the <i>Sat</i>, the positive
        state, just as all the life-forms take their origin from <i>Prana</i>
        (the positive life matter) and not from <i>Rayi</i> (the
        negative life matter) -- see the <i>Prasnopnishat</i>. It is
        only impressibility that exists I the <i>Asat</i>; the real
        names and forms of the phenomenal Universe do not exist there.
        In fact, the name <i>Asat</i> has been given to the primary
        state of the evolving universe for this very reason. If we would
        translate these two words into English, we would have to coin
        two very unique compounds: <i>Sat</i> (that-in-which-is) and <i>Asat</i>
        (that-in-which-is-not). </p>
      <p>It is only such a rendering that would carry the true idea, and
        hence it is advisable to retain the Sanskrit words and explain
        them as well as one can. </p>
      <p>That actually existing state in which the names and forms do
        not exist cannot very properly stand as the cause of the names
        and forms that do not exist. Hence the <i>Sat</i> alone was in
        the beginning, etc. </p>
      <p>The individual spirit has the same relation to the Sat as the
        soul has to the <i>Iswara</i>. </p>
      <p>That will do for now. It is enough to show that there is no
        annihilation anywhere in the Universe. <i>Nirvana</i> simply
        means the enlightenment (which is not extinction) of the
        phenomenal rays. </p>
