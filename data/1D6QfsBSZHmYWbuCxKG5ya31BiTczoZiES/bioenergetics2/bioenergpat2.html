      <br>
      A method of preparing bioenergetic nourishing water has steps of
      filtrating water from a water source to form a filtrated water,
      adjusting a hardness of the filtrated water, filtrating the
      filtrated water with ceramics to remove an original memory
      structure of the filtrated water, adding main herb liquid into the
      filtrated water to form a mixture, magnetizing the mixture to
      remove the main herb liquid from the mixture and to input and to
      arrange a new memory structure of the mixture, staying the mixture
      in a mineral-containing container still to release trace mineral
      elements into the mixture, and killing bacteria in the mixture to
      form a product.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0001] The present invention relates to a method of preparing
      bioenergetic nourishing water. More particularly, the present
      invention relates to a method of preparing bioenergetic nourishing
      water which will increase a health of a user under such a regimen.<br>
      <br>
      [0002] There are many methods to clean water from a water source.
      A water softening method uses cations in an ion exchange resin to
      exchange magnesium and calcium in water. However, the water
      softening method cannot filter impurities in water effectively. An
      active carbon filtration method uses active carbons to adsorb
      organic compounds such as trichloromethane and pesticides in order
      to clean water. However, active carbons cannot remove nitrates,
      nitrites, and heavy metals effectively. Furthermore, bacteria will
      be adsorbed on the active carbons to produce biological films. A
      distillation method cannot remove volatile compounds such as
      trichloromethane and trifluoromethane from the distilled water.
      Volatile compounds such as trichloromethane and trifluoromethane
      will remain in a boiling water also. A reverse osmosis method will
      produce pure water. However, trace mineral elements cannot remain
      in the pure water. Trace mineral elements are essential to health.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0003] An object of the present invention is to provide a method
      of preparing bioenergetic nourishing water which will increase a
      health of a user under such a regimen.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Accordingly, a method of preparing bioenergetic nourishing
      water comprises steps of filtrating water from a water source to
      form a filtrated water, adjusting a hardness of the filtrated
      water, filtrating the filtrated water with ceramics to remove an
      original memory structure of the filtrated water, adding main herb
      liquid into the filtrated water to form a mixture, magnetizing the
      mixture to remove the main herb liquid from the mixture and to
      input and to arrange a new memory structure of the mixture,
      staying the mixture in a mineral-containing container still to
      release trace mineral elements into the mixture, and killing
      bacteria in the mixture to form a product.<br>
      <br>
      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0005] A method of preparing bioenergetic nourishing water
      comprises steps of:<br>
      <br>
      [0006] step A: filtrate water from a water source to form a
      filtrated water in order to remove impurities and toxic materials
      in the water source,<br>
      <br>
      [0007] step B: adjust a hardness of the filtrated water in order
      to decrease a degree of calcification and a total solid amount in
      the filtrated water,<br>
      <br>
      [0008] step C: filtrate the filtrated water with ceramics to
      remove an original memory structure of the filtrated water and to
      remove alga and fungi in the filtrated water,<br>
      <br>
      [0009] step D: add main herb liquid into the filtrated water to
      form a mixture,<br>
      <br>
      [0010] step E: magnetize the mixture to remove the main herb
      liquid from the mixture and to input and to arrange a new memory
      structure of the mixture with a frequency resonance method,<br>
      <br>
      [0011] step F: stay the mixture in a mineral-containing container
      still to release trace mineral elements into the mixture, and<br>
      <br>
      [0012] step G: kill bacteria in the mixture to form a product.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] The trace mineral elements comprise magnesium, iron, zinc,
      copper, cobalt, chromium, iodine, fluorine, nickel, and selenium.
      The trace mineral elements will become active centers of hormones,
      vitamins, and nucleic acids.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] The bioenergetic nourishing water will increase a health of
      a user under such a regimen. The bioenergetic nourishing water has
      trace mineral elements and maintain a herb effect.<br>

        <b><b> </b>Formulations containing iron ores for the topical
          treatment of bioenergetic and electromagnetic disorders</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      The invention relates to formulations for the topical treatment of
      disorders with a bioenergetic basis, which contain a suspension
      obtainable by treating one or more iron ores with aqueous
      solutions having pH values of between 4 and 8. These formulations
      will be applied directly to the acupuncture points corresponding
      to the meridians involved in the conditions to be treated.<br>
      <br>
      <b>DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0001] This invention relates to ore-based formulations for the
      topical treatment of disorders with a bioenergetic basis.<br>
      <br>
      [0002] In particular, the invention relates to topical
      formulations containing a suspension obtainable by treating iron
      ores with aqueous solutions having pH values of between 4 and 8.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] The formulations of the invention are prepared by
      suspending suitable iron ores, previously pulverised, in
      sulphate-alkaline-ferruginous waters or in suitable inorganic salt
      solutions.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] The iron ores used in accordance with the invention
      include, in particular:<br>
      <br>
      [0005] a) Ferrites, especially spinels such as chromite, magnetite
      and magnesioferrite<br>
      <br>
      [0006] b) Ferric oxides and hydroxides such as haematite, limonite
      and goethite<br>
      <br>
      [0007] c) Ferric carbonates such as siderite<br>
      <br>
      [0008] d) Sulphides such as pyrrhotine or pyrrhotite, also known
      as magnetic pyrite or magnetopyrite<br>
      <br>
      [0009] e) Disulphides such as pyrite and marcasite<br>
      <br>
      [0010] f) Sulphates such as fibroferrite and jarosite<br>
      <br>
      [0011] g) Micas such as biotite<br>
      <br>
      [0012] h) Chlorites such as chamosite<br>
      <br>
      [0013] i) Silicates or metasilicates such as orthorhombic or
      monoclinic pyroxenes<br>
      <br>
      [0014] j) Iron organic compounds.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] The compositions of the invention may contain a mixture of
      iron ores constituted by all the types listed above or only some
      of them, such as a mixture of ferrites/spinels, carbonates,
      disulphides, sulphates and chlorites or oxides/hydroxides,
      sulphides, titanites, micas and silicates. Chlorites, jarosite,
      marcasite, pyrite and mixtures thereof are particularly preferred.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] Metallic iron, for example in the form of iron-bearing
      sands, iron filings and the like, may be added to the ore
      suspensions of the invention to further increase their
      electromagnetic potential.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] This potential can be further boosted by subjecting the
      suspensions, possibly enriched with iron powder, to magnetic
      fields which impart electromagnetic charges of at least 500 gauss
      to the suspensions; this is the minimum value for cosmetic
      applications, while higher values (=3000 gauss) are indicated for
      therapeutic use.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] Suspensions of particular ores of volcanic origin are known
      (EP 0759290) which differ from those forming the object of the
      invention because they have little or no iron ore content. Known
      suspensions are based on a totally different application concept
      associated with antioxidant activity and inhibition of the
      formation of free radicals of suitably treated volcanic ores.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] The novel compositions of this invention have little
      antioxidant activity, but focus on electromagnetic and
      bioenergetic properties typical of ores with a high iron content.
      These properties are to some extent the opposite of the
      antioxidant and anti-free radical properties of the suspensions
      described in EP 0759290.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] Powdered iron ores, obtained by grinding operations, for
      example, are suspended in ferruginous sulphate water, possibly
      after separation by sieving and heat treatment up to 50[deg.] C.
      or magnetic treatment (exposure to pulsating magnetic fields), at
      the typical rate of 1 kg of ore to 500 ml of water. Suitable
      rheological agents such as amorphous or microcrystalline silica,
      diatomaceous earths, and argillaceous phyllosilicates such as
      montmorillonite, bentonite, smectite, halloysite and the like, can
      then be added to the suspension.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] Iron salts solutions can replace the ferruginous sulphate
      waters. The pH of the suspensions of the invention is between 4
      and 8.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] The waters or solutions usable in accordance with the
      invention will preferably contain other salts, in particular
      reducing salts, so as to reduce the ferric or ferrous ion content
      of the ore at least partly to metallic iron, thus further
      enhancing the magnetic properties of the formulations.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] An increase in the metallic iron component can also be
      obtained at the ore treatment stage, by subjecting iron sulphates,
      carbonates, oxides or sulphates in particular to suitable
      degassing of the solutions at high temperature, under vacuum.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] The process for preparation of the formulations of the
      invention comprises the following steps:<br>
      <br>
      [0025] 1) drying the ore in air current at temperatures of between
      20[deg.] and 40[deg.] C.;<br>
      <br>
      [0026] 2) grinding without thermal stress;<br>
      <br>
      [0027] 3) screening to a constant, homogenous particle size of
      approx. 340 microns;<br>
      <br>
      [0028] 4) addition of predetermined volumes of aqueous solutions
      with a suitable pH to the resulting powders.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] At step 4), each ore component is added under stirring with
      turboemulsifiers at high speed for predefined times.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] The process is characterised by continuous extraction and
      recycling of the soluble or finely dispersed phase, the coarser
      solid components being eliminated by sifting with a vibrating
      sieve. After dissolving/dispersal, a pre-determined amount of a
      thickener such as diatomaceous earth is added until the required
      viscosity is reached.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] The formulations of the invention will be presented in the
      form of ore suspensions packaged in polyethylene-lined aluminium
      sachets, heat-sealed under a 99.9% vacuum.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] The iron ores usable in accordance with this invention may
      be of synthetic or natural origin, extracted from rocks with a
      high content of the ore in question, or of volcanic, sedimentary
      or other origin, provided that they are characterised by the same
      or very similar chemical and crystallographic compositions and the
      absence of other inorganic elements liable to interfere adversely
      with the biological activity of the suspensions of the invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] These compositions are useful for the cosmetic or
      therapeutic treatment of a variety of conditions, such as diffuse
      oedema, local adiposity, vascular lability, excess weight,
      hypotonicity, dysmetabolism, atonicity, acute and chronic
      articular and extra-articular muscular degenerative processes with
      an inflammatory basis, organic hypofunctionality, metabolic
      disorders, endocrine disorders, hypofunctionality of individual
      organs and apparatus, inappropriate immune responses, etc.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] The main therapeutic indications for the ore suspensions of
      the invention comprise acute joint disease (arthritis) and chronic
      joint disease (osteoarthritis), as demonstrated by comparison with
      classic therapeutic strategies (drugs), instrumental strategies
      (laser, ultrasound, direct and alternating current) and manual
      strategies (acupuncture and electroacupuncture).<br>
      <br>
      [0035] The therapeutic use of the formulations of the invention is
      based on the concepts of bioenergetic and electromagnetic
      remodulation of the affected apparatus and/or organs, thus
      inhibiting the degenerative processes before they reach them. In
      fact, measurement of the electromotive force potentials with
      suitable instruments at the acupuncture and/or electroacupuncture
      points reveals the hypo/hyperfunctionality of the areas concerned,
      allowing their bioenergetic remodulation and consequent
      restoration of the impaired metabolic processes.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] The topical formulations of the invention are applied
      directly to the acupuncture points corresponding to the various
      meridians involved in the cosmetic or pathological conditions to
      be treated.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] Particular attention should be paid to the application of
      these ore fractions in the spaces between the fingers and toes,
      the anatomical areas in which the acupuncture points corresponding
      to each meridian are most easily found.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] The ore suspensions of the invention may be used in
      association with the ore suspensions with a high antioxidant
      capacity disclosed in EP 0759290, which perform their specific
      activity directly in the areas in which they are applied, and can
      attract the electromagnetic flows released by the iron ore
      suspensions applied to the peripheral acupuncture points as a
      result of the potential difference.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] Energy is therefore released which flows from the hands or
      feet towards other areas, modifying their biochemical, functional
      and reactive characteristics, and synergising the antioxidant and
      anti-inflammatory action of the antioxidant ore suspensions
      already known.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] The following examples describe the invention in greater
      detail.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 1</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0041] The types of formulation can be summarised in three
      different methods.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] 10 kg of each type of iron ore constituting the 10 groups
      listed is added separately to 50 l of ferruginous sulphate water
      or suitably prepared iron salt solution (total 100 kg of ore +50 l
      of ore solution).<br>
      <br>
      [0043] This is followed by centrifugation, sieving and molecular
      excitation at different temperatures (30/40/50[deg.] C.), and a
      suitable consistency is obtained by adding micronised diatomaceous
      earths.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] The same process can be repeated using only one of the ores
      listed above or a mixture thereof, such as those constituted by
      ferrites/spinels, carbonates, disulphides, sulphates and chlorites
      or oxides/hydroxides, sulphides, micas and silicates.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 2</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0045] STEP A: 30 kg of chlorite-based ore, 10 kg of pyrite, 10 kg
      of marcasite and 10 kg of jarosite.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] STEP B: each ore in the formulation is added successively
      to a 100 l quantity of sulphate-ferruginous water by
      centrifugation for 20 minutes at not less than 1200 rpm.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] The suspensions are subjected to a first filtration with a
      vibrating sieve, then 20 kg of bentonite+20 kg of montmorillonite
      are added. The suspensions are then left to dissolve with a
      suitable emulsifier overnight (at least 12 hours), refiltered with
      a vibrating sieve, made up to consistency with 10 kg of
      diatomaceous earth, homogenised for 24 consecutive hours, and
      vacuum packed.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] This formulation can be used for cosmetic and
      pharmaceutical purposes, for the treatment of conditions such as
      such as diffuse oedema, local adiposity, vascular lability, excess
      weight, hypotonicity, dysmetabolism, atonicity, acute and chronic
      articular and extra-articular muscular degenerative processes with
      an inflammatory basis, organic hypofunctionality, metabolic
      disorders, endocrine disorders, hypofunctionality of individual
      organs and apparatus, inappropriate immune responses, etc.<br>

        <b><b> </b>Methods of using silica hydride mineral</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      The exact health benefits of silica hydride minerals,
      traditionally found in glacial streams, have long been the subject
      of speculation. Geochemical analysis indicates that such colloidal
      silica hydrides in water possess a silica-water interface that
      provides a hydrated surface and adsorbs other elements or
      compounds such as potassium, iron, magnesium, lithium, calcium,
      and hydrogen. Dietary supplements with similar properties have
      been formulated. When the silica-water interface of such compounds
      is saturated with reduced hydrogen, the compounds take on an
      overall negative charge and act as a reducing agent or antioxidant
      when in solution. When consumed, hydride ions introduced into the
      body by the silica hydride supplement donate electrons to body
      fluids. With proper dosages, the benefits of consuming silica
      hydride include reduction of lactic acid build-up, increasing
      cellular hydration, reduction of free radical damage, enhancement
      of mitochondrial bioenergetic capacity, increasing antioxidant
      activity, and enhancing the properties of drinking water.<br>
      <br>
      <b>TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0001] This invention relates to methods of using silica hydride
      minerals. More particularly, this invention relates to methods of
      using silica hydride minerals that have beneficial effects on
      lactic acid buildup during exercise, cellular hydration, free
      radical damage, mitochondrial bioenergetic capacity, antioxidant
      activity, and the suitability of water for conversion into optimal
      cellular body fluids.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0002] Amorphous silicate minerals, many of which are in the
      nanoparticle size range, were once common in natural water sources
      and abundant in glacial stream waters. Not only do the silica
      mineral particles bond water and other elements for transport;
      they also can be adsorbed with reduced hydrogen, which releases
      electrons, providing antioxidant or reducing potential to
      surrounding fluids.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] In one region of West Pakistan the people are known to
      enjoy excellent health and amazing longevity. A team of
      cardiologists found the heart health of the people to be
      exceptionally good and evidence of the people's delayed aging. The
      cardiologists attributed the good health and longevity in
      significant part to the abundance of colloidal silicate minerals
      in the glacial streams the people used for irrigation of food
      crops and drinking water.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Geochemical analysis indicates that colloidal silicate
      minerals display a variety of properties, including the formation
      of structured water around the silica-water interface, which
      provides a hydrated surface that adsorbs elements or compounds
      such as potassium, iron, magnesium, lithium, calcium, and
      hydrogen. FIG. 1 illustrates an example of the silica-water
      interface and the concentric structured water arrangement about
      the interface with the adsorption of elements within the layers.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] From silicate analogs, it is possible to formulate dietary
      supplements that are similar to the colloidal silicate minerals
      found in glacial waters and retain the geo-physical properties
      inherent to these minerals. An example of such synthesized
      silicate analogs is a silica hydride formula sold under the
      trademark Microhydrin(R) (a proprietary formula manufactured by
      Flanagan Technologies, Inc., Cottonwood, Ariz.). Substances
      possessing the characteristics and functions described in this
      application, such as Microhydrin(R), have assumed many names. For
      example, in addition to being called silica hydrides, such
      substances are known as amorphous silicate minerals, silicate
      particles, silicates, colloidal silicate minerals, silicate
      analogs, synthesized silicate analogs, functional silicate
      nanocolloids, dielectric interstitial hydrides, dietary silicate
      supplements, or dietary silicate antioxidants. Considering the
      many labels afforded this class of substances, the characteristics
      and functions of supplements must necessarily determine whether a
      particular supplement falls within the class.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Referring again to FIG. 1, the particle's silica-water
      interface can be saturated with reduced hydrogen, or hydride (H-)
      ions, and takes on an overall negative charge. In such cases, the
      particle then acts as a reducing agent or antioxidant when in
      solution (standard reduction-oxidation potential, -550 mV). It is
      capable of providing literally trillions of hydride ions able to
      donate electrons into body fluids. Electrons, which Albert
      Szent-Gyorgyi called the "fuel of life," are abundantly available
      in inorganically grown raw vegetables, fruits, and grains, but are
      deficient in our modem diet of over-cooked, acidic, or highly
      oxidized foods, beverages, and drinking water. In silica hydride
      minerals, the structured water around the silica-water interface
      stabilizes electron transfer. Such specific silicate interactions
      could play a substantial role in many biological processes by
      enhancing salvation properties and ion and water transport and by
      providing free radical antioxidant protection.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] Such electron deficiencies resulting from inadequate diet
      have a derogatory impact on specific biological processes such as
      lactic acid build-up, cellular hydration, damage from free
      radicals, mitochondrial bioenergetic capacity, antioxidant
      activity, and suitability of drinking water for conversion into
      optional cellular body fluids. Therefore, a need exists for a
      method of counter balancing these electron deficiencies and, as a
      result, enhancing each of these biological phenomena.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0008] The present invention identifies certain beneficial health
      effects of silica hydride minerals and the effective doses
      necessary to achieve desired results. With proper dosages, the
      benefits of using silica hydride minerals as a dietary supplement
      include: reduction of lactic acid buildup during and after
      exercise, increasing cellular hydration, reduction of free radical
      damage, enhancement of mitochondrial bioenergetic capacity,
      increasing antioxidant activity, and enhancing the suitability of
      water for conversion into optimal cellular body fluids.<br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0030] FIG. 2 charts the results of a study of blood lactic acid
      (lactate) levels 100 in six male cyclists during a 40K (24.8 mi)
      timed bicycle ride at maximum speed. In this embodiment of an
      effective dose, subjects received four 250 mg capsules of a silica
      hydride mineral or placebo each day, taking one in the morning,
      two at noon and one in the evening during the week prior to
      testing and during the week of testing. Subjects refrained from
      all other non-prescribed supplements during the testing period.
      Additionally, subjects took two 250 mg capsules with water thirty
      minutes before the start of exercise. Blood lactate was measured
      before, and five minutes after, each exercise session. During
      strenuous exercise, the blood lactate levels 100 of the group
      taking silica hydride 102 were significantly decreased as compared
      to the placebo group 104, from about 2 to about 1 mmol/L.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] Typically, lactic acid accumulates during strenuous or
      prolonged exercise. It causes pain, limits endurance, and is a
      common problem for athletes and people who lift weights, play
      sports, or do physical exercise for an extended time. Decreased
      lactate levels observed immediately after strenuous exercise
      indicate the silica hydride mineral's ability to help in providing
      a direct energy source (ATP production) to cellular function. An
      ergogenic energy function, such as this, is one that occurs when a
      substance enhances biochemical energy without introducing
      additional carbohydrates or calories to the diet.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] The dose of silica hydride for reduction of lactic acid
      build-up described above calls for 250 mg, four times per day. It
      will be understood by those skilled in the art, however, that a
      wide range of doses, ascertainable without undo experimentation,
      produce similar beneficial effects to a greater or lesser degree.
      Alternative embodiments for reduction of lactic acid build-up
      include ingesting silica hydride in amounts as small as about 10
      mg per day, or amounts as large as about 5000 mg per day. In
      addition, the doses may be ingested any number of times per day,
      as infrequently as once, or several more than the above-mentioned
      four times per day. Individuals may also find it necessary to
      increase or decrease the amount of silica hydride ingested to
      achieve desired results. For example, an individual may find 75 mg
      of silica hydride per day more beneficial than 10 mg. Similarly,
      one may find that increasing the dosage to 150 mg per day, 250 mg
      per day, or even 400 mg per day, and so on, achieves progressively
      better results. On the other hand, where one individual sees peak
      results taking 5000 mg per day at various intervals, another may
      see similar results by ingesting 3500 mg per day at a different
      set of intervals. Likewise, it may be advantageous to limit the
      dose, say from 3500 mg per day to 2000 mg per day, or to 1000 mg
      per day, or even to 750 mg per day, in order to see if the same
      results may be obtained at lower dosage levels.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] FIGS. 3 through 6 show the results of a study where
      consumption of silica hydride mineral increased intra- and
      extra-cellular hydration as compared to a placebo group. Hydration
      of the body was measured using the RJL Bioelectrical Impedance
      Analyzer, developed by R. J. Liedtke, which measures body
      hydration based on nutritional status. In the study, seven
      subjects received four 250 mg capsules of silica hydride mineral
      per day for two weeks and were crossed over receiving four
      capsules per day of a placebo.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] Body Cell Mass and Intracellular Water are assessments of
      intracellular volume and water inside the cell, respectively.
      Intracellular Water makes up approximately 60% of the total body
      water of healthy adults. Intracellular Water, as an indicator of
      cell integrity, is found to be higher in babies but decreases as
      adults age or lose body cell mass. Healthy tissue cells hold water
      within the cells and have higher anabolic (building up) function
      rather than catabolic (breaking down) function.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] FIG. 3 charts the value for Total Body Water (TBW) (110),
      the sum of intracellular (ICW) and extracellular water (ECW),
      which increased by 2.7% (112) when consuming silica hydride. The
      changes observed in TBW when subjects consumed the silica hydride
      mineral (116), compared to the placebo (118), showed statistical
      significance using a student's test for small sample groups.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] FIG. 4 shows the consumption of silica hydride also
      increased ICW (120), the most sensitive indicator of nutrition and
      metabolic state, of the silica hydride consuming group (126) over
      the placebo group (128), by 2.7% (122). As indicated by FIG. 5,
      Body Cell Mass (BCM) (130), or intracellular volume, another
      indicator of water within cells, also showed a 2% increase (132)
      during supplementation with silica hydride (136) compared to the
      placebo (138). Similarly, as indicated by FIG. 6, the increase in
      volume of water observed in ECW values (140), was also
      statistically significant, about 3.0% (142), when consuming silica
      hydride (144) as compared to taking the placebo (146).<br>
      <br>
      [0037] The dose of silica hydride for increasing cellular
      hydration described above calls for 250 mg, four times per day. It
      will be understood by those skilled in the art, however, that a
      wide range of doses, ascertainable without undo experimentation,
      produce similar beneficial effects to a greater or lesser degree.
      Alternative embodiments for increasing cellular hydration include
      ingesting silica hydride in amounts as small as about 10 mg per
      day, or amounts as large as about 5000 mg per day. In addition,
      the doses may be ingested any number of times per day, as
      infrequently as once, or several more than the above-mentioned
      four times per day. Individuals may also find it necessary to
      increase or decrease the amount of silica hydride ingested to
      achieve desired results. For example, an individual may find 75 mg
      of silica hydride per day more beneficial than 10 mg. Similarly,
      one may find that increasing the dosage to 150 mg per day, 250 mg
      per day, or even 400 mg per day, and so on, achieves progressively
      better results. On the other hand, where one individual sees peak
      results taking 5000 mg per day at various intervals, another may
      see similar results by ingesting 3500 mg per day at a different
      set of intervals. Likewise, it may be advantageous to limit the
      dose, say from 3500 mg per day to 2000 mg per day, or to 1000 mg
      per day, or even to 750 mg per day, in order to see if the same
      results may be obtained at lower dosage levels.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] FIG. 7 shows the results of testing to observe the effect
      of silica hydride mineral consumption on protection against free
      radical damage. The test of free radical damage was a double blind
      placebo controlled crossover pilot study conducted on seven
      subjects who received four 250 mg capsules per day of silica
      hydride for two weeks and received four capsules per day of a
      placebo for two weeks. Urine alkenal/creatinine ratios reflect
      free radical damage (150). The ratios were measured during silica
      hydride mineral supplementation (152). A 43% decrease (154) in
      free radical damage was observed as compared to the placebo group
      (156). The results demonstrate the ability of silica hydride to
      protect against serum alkenals. Alkenals are the oxidative
      products of serum lipid peroxides occurring from free radical
      attacks on cellular lipid membranes and lipoproteins. They are
      indicators of free radical damage in the body associated with a
      higher risk of age related diseases.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] The dose of silica hydride for reduction of free radical
      damage described above calls for 250 mg, four times per day. It
      will be understood by those skilled in the art, however, that a
      wide range of doses, ascertainable without undo experimentation,
      produce similar beneficial effects to a greater or lesser degree.
      Alternative embodiments for reduction of free radical damage
      include ingesting silica hydride in amounts as small as about 10
      mg per day, or amounts as large as about 5000 mg per day. In
      addition, the doses may be ingested any number of times per day,
      as infrequently as once, or several more than the above-mentioned
      four times per day. Individuals may also find it necessary to
      increase or decrease the amount of silica hydride ingested to
      achieve desired results. For example, an individual may find 75 mg
      of silica hydride per day more beneficial than 10 mg. Similarly,
      one may find that increasing the dosage to 150 mg per day, 250 mg
      per day, or even 400 mg per day, and so on, achieves progressively
      better results. On the other hand, where one individual sees peak
      results taking 5000 mg per day at various intervals, another may
      see similar results by ingesting 3500 mg per day at a different
      set of intervals. Likewise, it may be advantageous to limit the
      dose, say from 3500 mg per day to 2000 mg per day, or to 1000 mg
      per day, or even to 750 mg per day, in order to see if the same
      results may be obtained at lower dosage levels.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] Another benefit of consumption of silica hydride is
      enhancement of the bioenergetic capacity of the mitochondria. Such
      enhancement occurs by promoting formation of NADH, which enhances
      production of ATP, the principal mitochondrial energy source, as
      well as by enhancing the membrane potential of the mitochondria.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] Hydrogen is one of the most important elements donating an
      electron, an electron pair, or its proton to reduction/oxidation
      reactions of numerous enzymes and intermediates within the cell's
      metabolic pathways. Some of those reactions lead to production of
      ATP, the principal energy source of the mitochondria. In
      particular, ATP production depends on the production of NADH. NADH
      carries reduced hydrogen, generated by the Kreb's Cycle, into the
      mitochondria for the electron transport chain reactions that will
      ultimately create a molecule of water and ATP.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] FIG. 8 shows the results of tests of in vitro assays
      designed to measure the direct conversion of NAD&lt;+&gt; to NADH
      by the addition of silica hydride mineral. The sequential addition
      of increasing concentrations of silica hydride (160), up to at
      least 800 micrograms/ml (164), to NAD&lt;+&gt; shows a linear
      increase in NADH production (162) as measured by its absorption at
      350 nm.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] Silica hydride mineral has also proven to enhance NADH
      production in other tests. FIG. 9 shows measurements of
      mitochondrial NADH in cultures of intact living hypatocytes.
      Silicia hydride mineral was introduced to the cultured 90% viable
      rat hepatocytes. A laser scanning confocal microscope was used to
      visualize the blue auto-fluorescence of mitochondrial NADH. Under
      the conditions used, auto-fluorescence arises primarily from
      mitochondrial NADH. Oxidation of NADH to NAD&lt;+&gt; causes loss
      of fluorescence since only NADH is fluorescent, not NAD&lt;+&gt;.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] FIG. 9 summarizes data from three silica hydride mineral
      and three vehicle (control) experiments. In the silica hydride
      mineral group, NADH (178) increased 20% (170) over 20 minutes
      (180), while the vehicle group showed that NADH fluorescence (178)
      decreased by about 30% (172). These experiments demonstrate the
      promotion of electron transfers to NAD&lt;+&gt; in intact living
      hepatocytes. Moreover, the silica hydride mineral prevented the
      spontaneous oxidation (or bleaching) of NADH that generally occurs
      during incubation (see vehicle plot (172)), thereby indicating a
      continuous recharging of the pyridine nucleotide (NADH).<br>
      <br>
      [0045] In FIG. 10, mitochondrial membrane potential (200) was
      monitored using overnight cultured hepatocyes similar to the NADH
      experiment. The cultured hepatocytes were loaded for 20 minutes
      (194) with the fluorescent probe, tetramethylrhodamine methylester
      (TMRM). The medium was adjusted to pH 7.4. In these experiments,
      an increase of the mitochondrial fluorescence of TMRM represents
      an increase of mitochondrial depolarization (more negative
      membrane potential). The line graph summarizes data from three
      silica hydride mineral, and four vehicle experiments. In the
      vehicle group, TMRM fluorescence decreased by about 6% (192) over
      twenty minutes (194). In the silica hydride group, TMRM increased
      about 25% (198). These experiments demonstrate that silica hydride
      minerals enhance mitochondrial membrane potential in intact living
      hepatocytes.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] The combination of increased mitochondrial membrane
      potential and increased NADH relates to an enhancement of
      bioenergetic capacity of the mitochondria when silica hydride is
      present in the cell suspension. Silica hydride makes electrons or
      H- available to cofactors able to utilize these for cellular
      energy production. NADH provides electrons to the mitochondrial
      electron transport chain, directly producing H2O and ATP, the
      primary cellular energy source for numerous biochemical reactions
      throughout the cell.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] It will be understood by those skilled in the art that a
      wide range of effective doses of silica hydride, ascertainable
      without undo experimentation, enhance mitochondrial bioenergetic
      capacity in humans to a greater or lesser degree. Such range
      includes doses as small as about 10 mg per day, or doses as large
      as about 5000 mg per day. The doses may be ingested any number of
      times per day. Additionally, individuals may find it necessary to
      increase or decrease the amount of silica hydride ingested to
      achieve desired results. For example, an individual may find 75 mg
      of silica hydride per day more beneficial than 10 mg. Similarly,
      one may find that increasing the dosage to 150 mg per day, 250 mg
      per day, or even 400 mg per day, and so on, achieves progressively
      better results. On the other hand, where one individual sees peak
      results taking 5000 mg per day at various intervals, another may
      see similar results by ingesting 3500 mg per day at a different
      set of intervals. Likewise, it may be advantageous to limit the
      dose, say from 3500 mg per day to 2000 mg per day, or to 1000 mg
      per day, or even to 750 mg per day, in order to see if the same
      results may be obtained at lower dosage levels.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] Silica hydride minerals have also been tested for, and
      shown, antioxidant characteristics. In one evaluation, tests on
      silica hydride were conducted using electron spin resonance
      techniques (ESR) by a scientist who specializes in the evaluation
      of antioxidants at a major university. The following is quoted
      from the test report:<br>
      <br>
      [0049] We have made a thorough investigation of the antioxidant
      activity of [silica hydride] by several experimental methods.
      Hydroxyl radical scavenging activity was found in two different
      [silica hydride] preparations provided.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] Our conclusions are that [silica hydride] has antioxidant
      activity towards hydroxyl radicals. Hydroxyl radicals are among
      the most dangerous of oxygen free radicals that occur in
      biological systems. They are the same types of radicals that can
      be produced by exposure to ionizing radiation. Therefore, it can
      be stated that [silica hydride] has antioxidant activity in this
      regard.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] (Lester Packer, Ph.D., University of California at
      Berkeley, 1999).<br>
      <br>
      [0052] In a second evaluation of the antioxidant characteristics
      of silica hydride, tests were conducted by another scientist who
      specializes in the evaluation of antioxidants at a separate major
      university. The following is quoted from the test report:<br>
      <br>
      [0053] When assayed in the standard assay for super oxide
      dismutase activity based upon the reduction of cytochrome c by
      xanthine (see J. Biol. Chem. 244: 6049-6055, 1969), silica hydride
      mineral showed two characteristics:<br>
      <br>
      [0054] 1) Silica hydride can directly reduce cytochrome c, showing
      that it is a reducing agent (or an antioxidant).<br>
      <br>
      [0055] 2) Silica hydride can inhibit the superoxide-mediated
      reduction of cytochrome c, indicating that it can scavenge the
      superoxide free radical.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] (Joe McCord, Ph.D., University of Colorado Health Sciences
      Center, 1998).<br>
      <br>
      [0057] FIG. 11 shows the results of one evaluation of silica
      hydride's antioxidant capabilities. In this test, the silica
      hydride mineral was assayed with an alternative method based on
      the ability of superoxide to oxidize epinephrine to adrenochrome.
      As FIG. 11 demonstrates, silica hydride's antioxidant effects
      (200) increased linearly (210) from concentrations of less than 60
      micrograms/ml (220) to greater than 120 micrograms/ml (230).<br>
      <br>
      [0058] It will be understood by those skilled in the art that a
      wide range of effective doses of silica hydride, ascertainable
      without undo experimentation, increase antioxidant activity in
      humans to a greater or lesser degree. Such range includes doses as
      small as about 10 mg per day, or doses as large as about 5000 mg
      per day. The doses may be ingested any number of times per day.
      Additionally, individuals may find it necessary to increase or
      decrease the amount of silica hydride ingested to achieve desired
      results. For example, an individual may find 75 mg of silica
      hydride per day more beneficial than 10 mg. Similarly, one may
      find that increasing the dosage to 150 mg per day, 250 mg per day,
      or even 400 mg per day, and so on, achieves progressively better
      results. On the other hand, where one individual sees peak results
      taking 5000 mg per day at various intervals, another may see
      similar results by ingesting 3500 mg per day at a different set of
      intervals. Likewise, it may be advantageous to limit the dose, say
      from 3500 mg per day to 2000 mg per day, or to 1000 mg per day, or
      even to 750 mg per day, in order to see if the same results may be
      obtained at lower dosage levels.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] Silica hydride minerals are also capable of making water
      more suitable for conversion into optimal extracellular and
      intracellular body fluids. Tap water and bottled waters are
      oxidized, acidic, and do not provide a source of electrons. When
      consumed, the body must substantially alter their chemical
      characteristics in order to convert water into optimal
      extracellular and intracellular body fluids. Three such
      characteristics are conductivity, oxidation-reduction potential
      (ORP) and surface tension.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] Conductivity is critical to the optimal function of body
      fluids, and the conductivity of typical tap water is much lower
      than desirable. When conductivity was assessed, 250 mg of silica
      hydride in 8 oz of tap water increased conductivity from 10 to 895
      [mu]Mhos/c. Total dissolved solids also increased from 30 ppm to
      400-450 ppm.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] Oxidation-reduction potential is a measure of negative ions
      in solution. Metabolic oxidation-reduction reactions are extremely
      important to the cell. Oxidation-reduction reactions (or "redox"
      reactions) involve the loss of electrons by one chemical species,
      becoming oxidized, and the gain of electrons by another species,
      becoming reduced. The flow of electrons in redox reactions is
      responsible, directly or indirectly, for all of the work done by
      living organisms. The tendency of these reactions to occur depends
      upon the relative affinity of the electron acceptor for electrons.
      Electron flow is spontaneous and exergonic (releases energy) in
      the cell because oxygen, the final electron acceptor, has a higher
      affinity for electrons than do the intermediates that donate
      electrons.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] ORP is a measure of oxidation-reduction potential with
      standard meters, such as the Electronmeter, that measure negative
      ions in solution. Various types of water, depending on mineral
      salt content, and water treatments will show variability in ORP
      readings with standard meters. ORP measurements, when silica
      hydride is added to water, vary depending on water purity,
      dilution, the time it has remained in solution, proper cleaning of
      the meter probes, and maintenance of the meter.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] To measure the level of electrons available in silica
      hydride, a 250 mg capsule was dispersed into 8 oz of tap water and
      into each of twelve 8 oz. glasses of different brands of bottled
      water. The results shown in FIG. 12 were measured before, and one
      hour after, the addition of silica hydride. The average ORP of the
      bottled waters (240), +60 to +490 mv, was lower and more desirable
      than the ORP of tap water (242), +250 to +600 mv. In contrast, the
      average ORP of both tap water and bottled water after addition of
      250 mg of silica hydride (244), (246), -300 to -650 mv for both,
      was dramatically lower. FIG. 13 compares the ORP of 250 mg of
      silica hydride mineral in 4 oz. of water (248) to that of other
      common antioxidants.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] In addition to conductivity and oxidation-reduction
      potential, surface tension is a third property of concern when
      comparing the characteristics of tap or bottled water to the
      characteristics of optimal body fluids. The surface tension of tap
      water is approximately 73 dynes. The surface tension of
      extracellular fluids is much lower at approximately 45 dynes. This
      low surface tension is critical to cellular function, absorption
      of nutrients, and to the removal of toxins. 250 mg of silica
      hydride dispersed into an 8 oz. glass of tap water has been shown
      to reduce surface tension to approximately 45 dynes, the same
      surface tension as extracellular fluids.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] A wide range of doses of silica hydride, readily
      ascertainable by those skilled in the art, will make water more
      suitable for conversion into optimal intra- and extra-cellular
      body fluids. Such range includes amounts as small as about 1 mg
      per 8 oz. of tap water, or amounts as large as about 5000 mg per 8
      oz. of tap water. Individuals may find it necessary to increase or
      decrease the amount in order to achieve desired results. For
      example, an individual may find 30 mg of silica hydride per 8 oz.
      of tap water more beneficial than 1 mg. Similarly, one may find
      that increasing the dosage to 100 mg, 200 mg, or even 400 mg per 8
      oz. of tap water, and so on, achieves progressively better
      results. On the other hand, where one individual sees peak results
      by including 5000 mg of silica hydride in 8 oz. of tap, another
      may see similar results by mixing 3500 mg per 8 oz. of tap water.
      Likewise, it may be advantageous to limit the dose, say from 3500
      mg, to 2000 mg, to 1000 mg, or even to 750 mg per 8 oz. of tap
      water, in order to see if the same results may be obtained at
      lower dosage levels.<br>
      <br>
      [0066] Other tests of silica hydride also showed that in eight
      normal adult subjects, supplementation with silica hydride
      improved the characteristics of body fluids. As shown in FIGS. 14
      through 17, respectively, saliva pH, saliva rH2, blood
      resistivity, and urine resistivity showed statistically
      significant improvement in eight subjects after eighteen days of
      supplementation with four 250 mg doses of silica hydride per day
      on a schedule of one in the morning, two at midday, and one in the
      evening. FIG. 14 shows that the optimal range for saliva pH is
      6.75 to 6.50 (300) and that the supplementation decreased the
      group's average saliva pH from 7.03 (302) to 6.79 (304). FIG. 15
      shows that the optimal range for saliva rH2 is 21.5 to 23.5 (310)
      and the supplementation decreased the group's average saliva rH2
      from 24.9 (312) to 24.3 (314). The optimal range for blood
      resistivity, as shown by FIG. 16, is 190 to 210 (320), and the
      supplementation accounted for an average decrease of from 234
      (322) to 200 (324). The results of the urine resistivity tests are
      shown in FIG. 17, which reflects an optimal range from 30 to 45
      (330) and a decrease in the average value for the group after
      supplementation from 82 (332) to 64 (334).<br>
      <br>
      [0067] FIGS. 18 through 20 reflect data for three other
      parameters, urine pH, urine rH2, and saliva resistivity,
      respectively, that also showed improvement over the 18-day
      supplementation period when their average changes were calculated.
      The optimal range for urine pH is reported from 6.50 to 6.80
      (340). The described supplementation with silica hydride increased
      the average urine pH value from 5.87 (342) to 6.26 (344). The
      optimal range for Urine rH2 is reported from 22.5 to 24.5 (350).
      The silica hydride supplementation increased average urine rH2
      values from 21.9 (352) to 22.6 (354). As for saliva resistivity,
      FIG. 20 shows the optimal range is reported from 21.5 to 23.5
      (360) and the average values for the group decreased from 239
      (362) to 209 (364) with supplementation.<br>
      <br>
      [0068] The preceding effective dose of silica hydride for
      improving the characteristics of certain body fluids calls for 250
      mg, four times per day. It will be understood by those skilled in
      the art, however, that a wide range of doses, ascertainable
      without undo experimentation, produce similar beneficial effects
      to a greater or lesser degree. Alternative embodiments for
      improving the characteristics of certain body fluids include
      ingesting silica hydride in amounts as small as about 10 mg per
      day, or amounts as large as about 5000 mg per day. In addition,
      the doses may be ingested any number of times per day, as
      infrequently as once, or several more than the above-mentioned
      four times per day. Individuals may also find it necessary to
      increase or decrease the amount of silica hydride ingested to
      achieve desired results. For example, an individual may find 75 mg
      of silica hydride per day more beneficial than 10 mg. Similarly,
      one may find that increasing the dosage to 150 mg per day, 250 mg
      per day, or even 400 mg per day, and so on, achieves progressively
      better results. On the other hand, where one individual sees peak
      results taking 5000 mg per day at various intervals, another may
      see similar results by ingesting 3500 mg per day at a different
      set of intervals. Likewise, it may be advantageous to limit the
      dose, say from 3500 mg per day to 2000 mg per day, or to 1000 mg
      per day, or even to 750 mg per day, in order to see if the same
      results may be obtained at lower dosage levels.<br>

      </div>
      <br>
      FIELD: medicine. SUBSTANCE: method includes performance of
      diagnostics of pupil's energetic envelope by teacher-sensitive in
      order to reveal its sizes and form, teaching of pupil to feel
      energy flux between his palms by teacher's feelings and to
      manipulate it. In this case, teacher directs energy flux of his
      own to space between pupil's palms to enlarge pupil's energetic
      field. Then teacher and pupil establish energetic contact between
      their palms for correction of pupil's energetic envelope. Teacher
      activates pupil's energy flux till pupil has feelings of prickling
      or chill, warmth or humming, to create single magnetic field. This
      done, teacher moves energy flux along pupil's body by passes of
      his hands, with pupil checking his feelings of energy flux, after
      which pupil starts moving his energy flux over his body mentally
      at the same time checking its movement by his feelings at
      different points of body. In this case, teacher checks
      continuously energy flux movement by pupil with feelings of his
      own. Then teacher takes position of pupil, and pupil takes
      position of teacher and performs the same manipulations of
      teacher's energetic field for correction of the latter. In
      addition, teacher and pupil may exchange their positions many
      times to enhance correction efficiency. EFFECT: enhanced
      efficiency of correction. <br>
      <br>
      [0001]<br>
      The invention concerns medicine and can be used for mutual
      influence and correction of the functional state of the patient
      and the student-teacher-the sensitive, in which there is
      harmonization of the body, the development of its functions and
      systems of both parties bio energy cooperation.<br>
      <br>
      [0002]<br>
      It is known that for the correction of the functional state of the
      biological object using a variety of methods, including
      non-traditional.<br>
      Each of the known methods include a preliminary diagnosis of the
      biological object.<br>
      For example, a method of correcting the functional state of the
      biological object, in which diagnosis is carried out as the energy
      shell (RU, 2083239, 1997, A 61 N 2/00).<br>
      <br>
      [0003]<br>
      It is known as a method for correcting the functional state of the
      body, which carries out the diagnosis psychic healer (M. Frolov.<br>
      "Your health - in your hands."<br>
      Phoenix, 1996, S.35-102).<br>
      <br>
      [0004]<br>
      There is a method of correcting the functional state of the
      organism, is the impact of the operator's hand on the first series
      of the projection area of ??the thyroid and thymus, and then on
      the projection area of ??the pituitary gland several times over
      each projection in a circular motion in a clockwise direction at a
      distance from the skin surface, sufficient for the perception of
      the physical effects of the operator's hand to run periodically
      shakes movements (SU 1764509, 1985).<br>
      <br>
      [0005]<br>
      The disadvantage of the known methods of correcting the functional
      state is the low efficiency of energy harmonization of the entire
      human body, so that these methods can be applied to the correction
      of the impact of energy in a particular area of the body. In
      addition, the known methods are based on the unilateral action of
      the sensitive between operator and patient-student, do not make
      the task of mastering the technique autokorrektsii patient
      functional status and transfer of new knowledge and skills to the
      next patient-pupil to achieve bioenergoobmena and mutual
      correction of the body.<br>
      <br>
      [0006]<br>
      However, it is known that non-traditional methods of correction of
      the functional state of the body can be based on cooperation
      through the exchange of bioenergy (RU, 96100536, 1997).<br>
      <br>
      [0007]<br>
      Analogues of the invention solves the same problem in the
      available scientific, technical and patent literature have been
      found.<br>
      <br>
      [0008]<br>
      The technical result achieved the present invention is to provide
      a method for the mutual correction of the functional state of the
      two persons within a single energy fields, each of which can be
      located in the pupil-position of the patient, and the position of
      the teacher operator.<br>
      <br>
      [0009]<br>
      The essence of the invention is to achieve said technical result
      means the bio energy of interaction of the sensitive teacher and
      student in a single bio-field for the mutual correction of the
      body to its harmonization and development of functions and systems
      is the fact that the teacher previously taught student, focusing
      on their feelings, to feel the energy flow between the hands and
      manipulate it, for what the teacher directs the space between the
      arms student own energy flow, thereby increasing the energy field
      of the student and closing the latter with its own energy field to
      create a single energy field of bio energy cooperation between the
      parties, then under the control of the teacher pupil sensation
      energy flow in the form of tingling, heat, cold,buzz moves the
      energy flow through the body with the help of student passes his
      hands, and then goes to the student movement of their own mental
      energy flow through the body, controlling the movement of your own
      feelings energy field at different points of the body, while the
      teacher constantly monitors the movement of the energy flow of the
      pupil's own feelings, followed by treatment energy field on the
      student teachers and teacher movement control energy flow disciple
      of his own body and the subsequent change of the multiple
      positions teachers and students as participants in the bio energy
      cooperation.<br>
      <br>
      [0010]<br>
      The method is as follows.<br>
      <br>
      [0011]<br>
      First teacher diagnoses the sensitive energy shell patient learner
      to identify its size and shape, and the student is placed in the
      teacher more than 7 meters. In the diagnosis of the patient's
      energy shell-student should not cross arms, legs.
      Teacher-Sensitive activates its own energy exchange, rubbing his
      hands together until they sensible heat or other sensations in the
      form of buzz, tingling, pressure, raises his arm bent at the
      elbow, palm facing to the diagnosed patient pupil. Slightly
      shaking his hand back and forth, gradually approaching the teacher
      to the student until the background in the palm (buzzing,
      tingling, crushing) the feeling that testifies to capture the
      sensitive energy flow coming from the student, and then - before
      the first boundary of the energy dense shell. Thus defined the
      boundaries of the energy shell and shape in front and behind the
      pupil. Field of the distance from the palm of the teacher to the
      student should be OK 7 meters or more (at any age and growth)
      thick, active, uniform, regular round shape.<br>
      <br>
      [0012]<br>
      To determine the vertical boundaries of the energy shell teacher
      stands in front or to the side of the student on the platform or
      lifting his hand high over his head. The patient should not cower.
      Similarly to the above define the boundary energy shell top.
      Normally, it should be more than 60 cm.<br>
      <br>
      [0013]<br>
      Next, the operator conducts teacher with a student exercise to
      capture their own energy flow. For this student rubs his hands
      together, and focuses on the feelings arising in his hands in the
      form of tingling, heat, cold, pressure, buzz. To better capture
      those feelings and remove the patient brings the palm provides a
      team of experience between your hands, "ball", its elasticity, its
      rotating the changing position of the hands. Then the pupil
      spreads palms on the distance at which caused sensations do not
      disappear, manipulating energy flows passing between the hands
      without losing his feeling. At the same time the patient is
      approaching and departing the palm as it creates a compressive and
      tensile energy flow - "energy accordion"; give yourself a mental
      command, spreading his hands at a distance of 15-20 cm, about that
      from one palm to another send and return the energy flow; the
      index finger of one hand rotates the opposite palm of the other
      hand, sends a beam of energy and feels it in the palm of the
      rotation, while it is advisable to carry out not only the
      rotation, but also to "draw" an energy ray square, rectangle,
      triangle, etc. In carrying out this exercise, the patient-student
      should clearly feel the energy contact and constantly evaluate the
      strength of feelings and their ability to manage the energy flow.<br>
      <br>
      [0014]<br>
      Then the teacher turns to the impact of the shell correction
      energy-patient student, which is carried out in two stages: I
      stage - for the correction of the external form; Stage II - for
      the correction of internal form. During the procedures the
      patient-student must stand steadily and quietly (without any
      unnecessary movements, attention is focused on their own
      feelings). The operator in the process of impact does not use any
      thought forms, the work is carried out only with energy. First,
      the teacher and the student establish contact between the energy
      of each other palms (hands in front of chest, elbows bent). The
      teacher makes a circular motion with his hands, activating the
      power of the patient. In the hands of the patient having different
      kind of feeling, similar to the above in the training of the
      patient's own sensations capture the energy flow. To control the
      appearance of the power contacts of patients is constantly
      focusing on their own feelings. Over time, the further development
      of the sensitivity of feeling will occur in other parts of the
      body of the patient-pupil.<br>
      <br>
      [0015]<br>
      In the event of the Sustainable Energy patient-student contact,
      focusing on their feelings, she says "there" and slowly fades into
      7 meters from the teacher, hands down. Both hands remain through
      energokontakt, "stretching" the energy field. Next, the operator
      begins to correct the effects of the external form, which includes
      three procedures: first - the teacher swirls smooth hand movements
      raises energy flow from the bottom up, as if whipping featherbed,
      creating waves in the combined field and patient teacher. From the
      top position, arms to the side, making flowing motion with his
      hands, hands down. Repetitive motion 10-12 times; the second - the
      pupil is rotated clockwise 180 back to the master, and slowly
      lowers his hands down. The teacher repeats the above movement
      "whipping featherbeds" 10-12 times; third - student rotates
      clockwise facing the teacher and the teacher makes the same
      movements 2-3.<br>
      <br>
      [0016]<br>
      The teacher then conducts exposure to correct internal form, for
      which the patient-student is standing still with his hands down,
      the teacher approaches him and gets behind him (all the teachers
      move around the patient are produced only in a clockwise
      direction). Impact includes six procedures for stored energy
      contact between teacher and student, which is controlled by the
      above feelings student: first - hand movements to drag the teacher
      directs the energy flow from the feet to the coccyx and spine up
      to the head of the patient, making the flowing movements with his
      hands over his head and along the sides of the patient, palms
      facing down to the floor and repeat the movement 5-6 times; the
      second - a teacher standing on the left side of the patient and
      placing the right hand rear, left (screen) - Front pupil at a
      distance of 10-15 cm from the body, the right hand does splashing
      movement, pushing energy flow through the body of the patient and
      reflecting left-handed (TV) energy flow . After each stroke the
      teacher consistently raises both hands up to 15-20 cm, and repeats
      the motion splashing. Movement is carried out from the bottom up,
      and when he reached the patient's head, the teacher takes the
      right arm forward and slowly lowers his hands down. Movement
      repeated 5-6 times; third - the teacher, standing face-to-patient,
      jumping movements palms moves energy flow along the sides of the
      pupil from the bottom up, gets his hands behind his neck and drops
      them down movement is repeated 5-6 times; Fourth - as in the
      second, only the teacher has changed hands in places, is on the
      right side of the patient, working behind the left hand, right in
      front - "screen"; fifth - standing behind the student, the
      teacher, setting the stage hands forward of the patient at the
      level of the neck moves the energy flow to the back of the head
      and carries it through the patient's head forward and down,
      forming an analogy helmet. It also checks the correct shape and
      density of the field around the patient's head; sixth - a teacher
      standing in front of a pupil moves the energy flow in a circular
      motion for 2-3 clockwise circle above his head, slowly lowering
      your hands down. Those movements are carried out before the eyes
      of the patient.<br>
      <br>
      [0017]<br>
      All the procedures for correcting the effects of the energy shell
      held at energokontakte between teacher-sensitives and
      patient-pupil, which is controlled by the patient's feelings
      arising in his own perception of teaching energy flow.<br>
      <br>
      [0018]<br>
      Next, the teacher offers the student repeat the previous movements
      of the energy flow, which is held in the body of the student
      teacher, do yourself. At the same time the teacher constantly
      monitors the movement of the energy flow of the student and, if
      necessary, helps him with the same passes hands, reminding problem
      mentally "push" energy flow.<br>
      <br>
      [0019]<br>
      After mastering the technique of self-disciple move the energy
      flow of your own body, the teacher becomes the position of the
      pupil and a new teacher (ie the pupils) is doing the same
      manipulation of the energy field of a new student (ie, previously
      trained teachers), described above. Next, the teacher and student,
      as participants in the bio energy cooperation, repeatedly changing
      the positions of teacher and student.<br>
      <br>
      [0020]<br>
      In this lesson, one of the partners does not lose energy as first
      teacher produces enhanced "exhale" energy to enhance energy flow
      and simplify the pupil sensitive energy flow, and then the
      disciple carries out energy "breath", while in the position of
      teacher.<br>
      <br>
      [0021]<br>
      In principle, the method of moving the energy flow through the
      body can learn on their own, with appropriate instructions. But,
      firstly, it is not always possible, and secondly, the process is,
      in practice, very long. Education is such a movement with a
      partner, the sensitive rezultativen in 100% of cases, and ten
      times faster than with learning.<br>
      <br>
      [0022]<br>
      The method is illustrated by the following examples.<br>
      <br>
      [0023]<br>
      Example 1. Nadia P., born in 1985 In a class by the method
      according to the invention has led her mother, because the
      daughter was always sluggish, inactive behavior in school and at
      home. In addition, constant pain in the stomach during the
      examination revealed intestinal dyskinesia (often at very strong
      pains had to call an ambulance). Nadi condition was confirmed by
      medical findings.<br>
      <br>
      [0024]<br>
      In the method according to the invention with Nadia became engaged
      two "teachers" - VB and NB Three sessions were held on the
      principle of "teacher" - "student" when the "teacher" is only as
      energy donors. The fourth lesson, Nadia felt energy flow, the
      fifth NB I felt a strong energy flow from Nadi, and the impact has
      been powerful, dramatically noticeable, if the accumulated number
      of first employment grew dramatically in quality.<br>
      <br>
      [0025]<br>
      Mastering the technique autokorrektsii allowed Nadia to normalize
      all systems of the body's own, harmonizing the it: Nadia stopped
      tired of schoolwork, began to maintain clarity of thought into the
      evening, got stronger physically stopped the pain in the gut.
      According to Nadia, she began to feel the lightness in the body
      and in the head. Medical institutions confirm the changes in the
      body, health Nadi.<br>
      <br>
      [0026]<br>
      Mastering the same procedure to the second party vzaimokorrektsii
      energy cooperation has led to the fact that Nagy was the correct
      functional state of the sisters, who suffer from chronic angina.
      Nadia also warns sciatica and low back pain in the mother helps
      with headaches and high blood pressure at a friend's, which was
      confirmed surveys.<br>
      <br>
      [0027]<br>
      Example 2. Katja R., born in 1985 I became involved in the process
      according to the invention at 11 years of age. At this point: 12
      tiperstnoj inflammation intestine, cholecystitis, which is
      confirmed by the medical reports. Appeal to traditional medicine
      does not help. Katya involved two teachers who stated that at the
      first lesson, Kate was able to manage their own energy flow by
      moving his body. At the first lesson, the teacher felt the reverse
      flow of energy. Functional and organic changes in the body of
      Katie disappeared, which was confirmed by the medical reports.
      After mastering the technique vzaimokorrektsii Katya herself moved
      to the status of teachers, and currently successfully working with
      the students, giving them their experience, as well as helping
      them to autokorrektsii body.<br>
      <br>
      [0028]<br>
      Example 3. TK Brothers (born 1984) and EK (born 1985). Tired at
      school, often sick: TK - Pancreatitis, gastrointestinal disease,
      constant runny nose; EK - Obstruction of the left iliac artery,
      intermittent claudication, persistent colds (diagnosis confirmed
      in the Children's Clinical Hospital. Filatov children's polyclinic
      N 19). Classes are conducted with the teacher VG, which is already
      on the 2nd and 3rd class felt the energy exchange with the
      brothers. For family reasons brothers were engaged in accordance
      with the invention only once a week, while the rest of the
      students engaged in group 3 times a week. After explanations and
      even primary influence teacher brothers are successfully and
      quickly, keeping up with the other students have mastered the
      procedure of energy groups, as continued employment at home with
      each other, where they were constantly changing position of the
      teacher - student. As a result, at the moment vzaimokorrektsii
      healthy brothers, as evidenced by extracts from medical
      institutions.<br>
      <br>
      [0029]<br>
      Example 4. P. Family - husband, wife and daughter. Husband (AN) -
      a disease of the thyroid gland (autoimmune tereoidit), gastritis,
      liver hypotheses. AN She became engaged in the procedure of the
      invention, together with his wife and daughter. The first lesson
      the teacher did not bring any result, become annoying. However, at
      home with their homework with the help of his wife suddenly I felt
      the flow of energy, that further helped to successfully master the
      technique. The family at the moment everyone is healthy, continue
      to engage in energy exchange teacher - student when changing
      positions constantly. An additional effect was that the improved
      visual acuity and color vision acuity in both eyes.<br>
      <br>
      [0030]<br>
      Below are details of the conduct of activities in groups engaged
      by the method according to the invention: the group consisted of 5
      children and 5 parents after 1st class all the children began to
      feel the energy flow, the parents - after the 2nd, control the
      energy after the children were 2 th class, the parents - after the
      4th. Classes are held not only in the group but also individually
      at home between parent and child, which gave good results in the
      development of methodology. With chronic diseases (such as
      parents, and children) were quickly offset by a skills energy
      exchange.<br>
      <br>
      [0031]<br>
      As seen from the above examples, the method according to the
      invention allows to adjust the status of the body of both
      participants of energy that is constantly changing its position of
      teacher and student. This condition is corrected not only the
      individual organs and systems, but also the whole organism.<br>

      <b>TECHNICAL FIELD </b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The present invention relates to medical engineering and is
      intended for the protection of human and living organisms from
      harmful anthropogenic origin fields.<br>
      <br>
      [0002]<br>
      <b>BACKGROUND.</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0003]<br>
      The concept of the field in modern physics is defined as a form of
      existence of matter, transmission interference. Status of atoms
      and molecules, living cells correspond to transitions between the
      different energy states of their own. These states correspond to
      well-defined internal motion of atoms or molecules. So in an atom
      can only motion of electrons. The molecules have a further field
      of vibrational and rotational motion. Influence of molecular
      vibrational fields hardly evident in everyday life. However, the
      rotational motion of molecules and groups of atoms create a field
      rotation, which at certain frequencies can enter into resonance
      with the field of human interaction or a living organism.<br>
      <br>
      [0004]<br>
      A characteristic feature of the field of rotation is the property
      of imprinting, the Transfer of the main characteristics of the
      material object on the field without mass transfer. Due to the
      proximity of the physical nature of fields of rotation and
      gravitational fields of the field considered almost escaped
      natural and built environments and can travel considerable
      distances with an abnormally low attenuation. This in turn leads
      to permanent effects on humans and other living organisms are an
      enormous amount of harmful fields of technological origin.
      Influence of technological fields, and rotation on human organisms
      can be very different, ranging from the termination of life before
      the appearance of mutants with unusual properties. The physical
      parameters of the field due to the rotational motion of the
      molecules is different from the field of the electromagnetic wave
      generated by various vibrators, the presence of divergent spiral
      Poynting vector from the point of generation in the molecule in
      the presence of the rotating components of the electric and
      magnetic field component. <b>The most harmful to human health and
        living organisms are man-made rotating field in the wavelength
        range of 100 ... 900 nm, which coincide with the spectrum of the
        functioning of cells.</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      [0005]<br>
      According to the fundamental law of the material world physical
      field it can be absorbed, offset or rejected just such a field, or
      its individual components having the same nature background close
      vzaimokorreliruyuschie frequency spectra and interaction in space.
      Airspace is inherently linear space, t. E. There is no
      transformation of spectra and fields. In this connection any
      person bioenergetic protection and living organisms is possible
      only on the basis of correlated or fields based on nonlinear
      spaces and environments.<br>
      <br>
      [0006]<br>
      A device protect living organisms from adverse effects of
      electromagnetic fields and others (see. U.S., A 61 B 19/00, N WO
      9608207 A1), which generates electromagnetic fields. These fields
      are superimposed in opposition to the external field, offsetting
      their negative effects. Since this device generates a transverse
      electromagnetic wave, offset rotary field it can not in principle
      due to the lack of correlation parameters.<br>
      <br>
      [0007]<br>
      Known radiation protection device (see. Patent of the Russian
      Federation N 2033200, cl. A 61 N 1/16, Patent of Russian
      Federation N 2071366, cl. A 61 N 1/16), ensure the protection of
      personnel working in the area of the electromagnetic radiation
      through the formation of local area by receiving compensation and
      reflection in the opposite harmful electromagnetic field. By
      virtue of a constructive solution on the basis of the resonant
      coil and a silver plate these devices can not form a compensating
      field for technological fields with the quantum wave nature.<br>
      <br>

      A device for forming a protective energy field (see. Patent of the
      Russian Federation N 2057552, cl. A 61 N 1/16, Patent of Russian
      Federation N 2033200, cl. A 61 N 1/16), thus providing a
      biological screen due to excitation of a discharge lamp and an
      oscillatory circuit. In essence gas-discharge device it is a
      variant of the nonlinear plasma antenna, forming a spherical
      quantum wave and electromagnetic fields. Together, these fields
      simultaneously emitted into space, creating a biological screen
      large enough area simultaneously irradiated to protect biological
      objects in range of the device, which in some cases is
      undesirable.<br>
      <br>
      [0009]<br>
      Known useful model of the device for protection against the energy
      field (see. The certificate for a utility model N 0002741, cl. A
      61 H 39/00), in which the biological shield is formed by IR source
      of electromagnetic energy and the divergent optical radiation. The
      device in question is designed to protect the bio-energetic
      doctors Follistim by IR fields of sick people. The effective
      protection of people from most of the fields of technological
      origin of rotation the device in question can not provide because
      of limited width and power spectrum, and the lack of correlation
      structure of physical interaction with the fields generated by
      rotational motion of molecules.<br>
      <br>
      [0010]<br>
      <b>SUMMARY</b> <br>
      <br>
      The Irresistible technological progress has led to the fact that
      today the military equipment, research laboratories, production
      facilities, many residential and office buildings full of
      different electronic equipment that is in addition to the usual
      for all of &amp; alpha;, &amp; beta;, &amp; gamma; radiation,
      X-rays TVs and PC monitors emit field level before rotation (10-16
      J / s) or more. Together, these fields are absorbed by the human
      body, to compensate for that organism consumes a significant
      amount of internal energy, and the person gets tired quickly, he
      can develop various diseases. For example, a survey of the
      operators PC company VTsIOM showed Russia (Savelyev IV
      Karmaenergeticheskie vampires. Dubna. 1997): 74% of respondents
      said that they have tired eyes, among them 31% responded that they
      are visually impaired; 30% feel after working on the PC
      irritability; many operators torment, depression, headache,
      insomnia, skin irritation, and chronic fatigue.<br>
      <br>
      [0011]<br>
      Protection of technological fields rotation plays an important
      role in conducting biological experiments in laboratories. The
      technical result of the invention is to provide a flat vertical
      screen protective bioenergy, energy-absorbing man-made field
      rotation with a level of 10-16 J / s or more.<br>
      <br>
      [0012]<br>
      To do this, the basis of the physical principle of the device
      bioenergetic protection of human and living organisms from the
      rotation fields of technological origin laid quantum correlations
      properties of spatially separated quantum interacting systems. The
      nature of quantum correlations provides almost instant effect on
      the beams of particles and fields, it does not depend on the
      distance and extends to interacting quantum systems having the
      same emission and absorption spectra.<br>
      <br>
      [0013]<br>
      Creating a flat vertical protective screen bioenergetic energy
      absorbing technological fields rotation is performed by
      space-energy and magnetic field of the earth in the apparatus
      comprising a cylindrical resonator volume made of magnetic
      material, with vertically arranged holes, inside of which are
      placed in series: the magnetic shield, the wave emitter absorber.
      The cavity resonator is made of a ferromagnetic material and has
      at the bottom an annular cylindrical magnet that provides a
      vertical cavity surface forming a magnetic pole "S", and at the
      base of the pole "N". To reduce losses during the formation of the
      quantum-field interacting inside the cavity inner surface of the
      latter is made of mirror to multiple reflection of electromagnetic
      fields and electron beams with a spectrum of up to 1015 Hz.
      Magnetic screen made of steel mesh, provides closure of magnetic
      field lines of the upper air space of the cavity resonator, and
      also serves as a magnetic mirror for vertical flow of cosmic
      energy by passing it just inside the resonator. Formation of the
      necessary correlation of the field is carried out in a wave
      emitter due to bremsstrahlung and the precession of the
      composition of inorganic ions crystals Na2B2O4, CaCl, KMnO4,
      having the desired (100 ... 900 nm) radiation range.<br>
      <br>
      [0014]<br>
      To improve the efficiency of the device at the bottom of the
      cavity is placed an absorber made based on the composition of
      inorganic ions crystals KMnO4, SiO2, dipoles of carbon filaments
      and having a broad absorption band.<br>
      <br>

      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b> <br>
      <br>
      The device 1 comprises a cavity 1 formed by a ferromagnetic
      material having a relative permeability &amp; mu ;, two magnetic
      shield formed by a magnetized steel mesh wave transmitter 3,
      comprising a set inorganic ions crystals Na2B2O4 , CaCl, KMnO4,
      having emission bands of precession and in the region of 100 ...
      900 nm absorber 4 is made on the basis of composition of inorganic
      ions crystals KMnO4, SiO2, dipoles of carbon filaments and having
      absorption in the range of 100 ... 1000 nm, annular cylindrical
      magnet 5.<br>
      <br>
      [0017]<br>
      The device operates as follows.<br>
      <br>
      [0018]<br>
      The cavity resonator 1 and the magnetic shield 2 is concentrated
      magnetic flux B land within its scope (in the thickness of the
      walls of a ferromagnetic material and in the air).<br>
      <br>
      [0019]<br>
      When excited by the wave emitter 3 Earth's magnetic field B,
      cosmic flow of energy and charged particles formed by the
      precession of the components of the radiator 3, the brake light
      and the vertical flow of electrons that are in motion along the
      magnetic field lines in a spiral downwards inside the cavity
      formed vortex quantum-wave and magnetic fields . These fields, in
      turn, is formed in the area outside the openings of the cavity
      resonator complex spanning one quantum-wave and magnetic vortex
      field which covers an area of about 80o ... 85o vertically and a
      width equal to the width of the hole.<br>
      <br>
      The magnetic field due to the action of the Lorentz force deflects
      all moving charged particles perpendicular to the field, or at a
      certain angle, which are then tightened by a magnetic field in the
      interior of the device through the openings surround the
      cylindrical resonator 1. Power lines rotation fields deflected
      towards the holes and tightened into the interior of the quantum
      wave field of the resonator 1.<br>
      <br>
      [0020]<br>
      For the purpose of the additional resonance absorption of the
      energy of the field of rotation and moving charges inside the
      cavity resonator mounted sink 4, the range of molecular absorption
      coincides with the range of rotation of the wave field and moving
      particles. The annular cylindrical magnet 5 acts as a
      magnetization body cavity 1.<br>
      <br>
      [0021]<br>
      The height h and the width t of the field generated, FIG. 2 can be
      changed by changing the height of the cavity resonator 1 and the
      width of its apertures. The length field L generated depends on
      the magnetic induction B and &amp; mu; the magnetic material of
      the cavity resonator 1, and the power flow space type ions the
      chemical components of the wave transmitter 3 and may reach 5 ...
      7 m. The more B &amp; mu ;, and the greater the absorbed power and
      the length of the generated field. The wavelength range of the
      absorbed fields is governed by the type of chemical and crystal
      diameter cavity.<br>
      <br>
      [0022]<br>
      Protective device properties bioenergetic protection lies in the
      fact that when exposed to external harmful anthropogenic emissions
      similar properties and structure of the field generated within the
      cavity, the device absorbs and prevents their entry into the
      protected zone. In addition, the device provides absorption of
      charged particles moving perpendicular to the field, or at some
      angle to the energy of motion to 10-16 J / s or more.<br>
      <br>
      [0023]<br>
      Generated field also protects against unauthorized psychic impact,
      and by imprinting diseases of the sick person and other biological
      objects surrounding people and other living organisms.<br>

      this group of biological objects.<br>
      <br>
      [0003]<br>
      It is known that for the correction of the functional state of a
      biological object using a variety of methods, including
      non-traditional. Each of the known methods include a preliminary
      diagnosis of the biological object. For example, a method of
      correcting the functional state of the biological object, in which
      diagnosis is carried out as the energy shell (RU, 2083239, 1997, A
      61 N 2/00).<br>
      <br>
      [0004]<br>
      It is known as a method for correcting the functional state of the
      body, which carries out the diagnosis psychic healer (M. Frolov.
      Your health - in your hands. 1996, p. 35-102).<br>

      In the available literature sources were found, illustrating the
      correction of functional state of a group of people united by a
      common implementation of the work.<br>
      <br>
      [0006]<br>
      The concept is based on the authors that the most delicate
      information up being a world of causes. In the causal image
      recorded spiritual and physical condition of any object, group of
      objects, and the quality of his or their interaction with the
      environment, with a group of people united by a common
      implementation of the work can be considered as a single
      biological object. On the basis of the causal impact of the
      structure and mechanisms of transport phenomena in chains of
      causality carried out all kinds of creation, transmission,
      storage, processing and use of information technology devices, the
      individual biological objects, groups of people, ie, collectives.
      The causal approach allows to perceive the causes of outgoing as a
      place of gathering information, fields and forces. The image of
      the reason interacts with time and space, creates a spinor field,
      which is informative and becomes a power factor manifested through
      causal relationships. The reason, condensing and creating, through
      the following stages: information, in the form of an image
      recording in the spinor field, the implementation and the effect
      on the gross material physical plane.<br>
      <br>
      [0007]<br>
      Spinor field is purely informational (GI Shipov. The theory of the
      physical vacuum. Science, 1997), but the interaction with the
      energy fields in the structure of their energy-twist occur which
      cause the distortion of space and time components of the ongoing
      process, and on the physical plane manifest adverse events and
      situations. The homogeneous structure of the spinor field is the
      harmonious development of people, ie, Social bioobject.<br>
      <br>
      [0008]<br>
      The authors found that the starting point for the correction of
      Energy twists mental images is a perfect development of any group
      of people united by a common implementation of the work for the
      realization of any problems. This mental images and corrects the
      functional state of people.<br>
      <br>

      The method consists of three phases: a survey group of people
      united by a common implementation of the work by finding the
      causes of the violations, the effect to eliminate the cause, it is
      as follows.<br>
      <br>
      [0013]<br>
      Working with a group of people united by a common implementation
      of the work requires bioenergospetsialista more subtle perception
      of attitude than the average person, which is achieved by practice
      and exercise hands and sensitivity setting of consciousness prior
      to the examination. This comprehensive approach by the authors
      called "tonkochuvstvitelnogo perception." Screening and diagnosis
      is direct access to the causes of deviations in the normal
      functioning of the group of people who are seen in the form of
      bulk bioenergospetsialistom fancies.<br>
      <br>
      [0014]<br>
      As the worsening perception bioenergospetsialista that it is
      possible in the presence of a certain experience, it is possible
      to see (feel) more subtle threads of causality and to conduct a
      deeper analysis of the team.<br>
      <br>
      [0015]<br>
      Bioenergospetsialist first a left hand, palm up, and mentally
      builds on it a coordinate system that is the basis on which rests
      fancies. Palm has a horizontal thumb maximum allotted from the
      other four, contiguous. Mentally, carried in the palm of the axes,
      which from a point in the center of the palmar surface, carried
      out perpendicular to the line up, the other - down. Also through
      this point is performed mentally two intersecting at right angles
      in the same plane in the palm lines, with one line extending
      between the third and fourth contacting fingers through a point
      near the middle of the palm and wrist, and the other - it
      perpendicularly through the center of the palm.<br>
      <br>
      [0016]<br>
      The need to introduce the coordinate system for fixing the mental
      images caused by that change (does not meet the norm) fancies
      strives for self-preservation and restoration. Mental images,
      which sees bioenergospetsialist in a three-dimensional coordinate
      system, the authors called the matrix. When working with this
      template changes the negative image and the formation of the
      optimal harmonious way, is correct.<br>
      <br>
      [0017]<br>
      The coordinate system TSL contains axis: T - time, S -
      interaction, L - space. In each case, the condition of these
      components is used, the topological scheme sketched the general
      condition of people and analyzes the process of its interaction
      with external factors. The projection of any image on the dynamic
      coordinate system is static, stationary and respond well to the
      hand. Fixing mental images, dynamic coordinate system distorts his
      view of the image is identical to the image, and make the
      appropriate changes in the way the changes in the functional state
      of the real group.<br>
      <br>
      [0018]<br>
      Specialist at the beginning of the study a left hand, palm up,
      mentally builds on it a coordinate system and then by asking the
      question of the study group, shows fancies and projects it on
      dynamic coordinate system. All movements of Energy flows over the
      left hand (Fig. 1 - coordinate 1) show the rise of the spiritual,
      the harmonious development of the group. All movements under the
      palm (coordinate 2) - disharmony, drop weight of the past,
      dropping into the lower vibrations. Coordinate 3 shows the
      movement of the group and its development in the outer space, and
      coordinate 4 characterizes the interior of the group, that is, an
      operating time of creativity, which can occur at high creative
      rise to spiritual perfection or self-interest, the pursuit of
      profit by any means on the move following coordinates 4.
      Coordinates 5 and 6 include internal and external interaction, as
      manifested in the operating time of any good: it is spiritual
      achievements, knowledge, skill, ability and wealth. The further
      movement of energy-flow above the axis 5-6 from the origin, the
      greater the benefit. Failures at this point to the axis of the
      loss of a certain kind of good.<br>
      <br>
      [0019]<br>
      In the chosen coordinate system dynamic matrix exploring right
      hand, using the property of hands catching energy-flows in the
      matrix space. The matrix is ??not limited to a plane, matrix space
      defined beyond the reach of the right hand.<br>
      <br>
      [0020]<br>
      Location mental images in the dynamic coordinate system to
      determine the direction of the forces and their topology. The
      study of mental images produced with his right hand, which is
      making passes, explores the mental images, while constantly
      keeping specialist during mental images in your mind and in your
      hand the emergence of any sensations in any coordinate identifies
      abnormalities that cause finds violations of the functional state
      group and eliminates mental image of reasons. Then the group
      formed mental images in normal (Figure 2), and for the correction
      of mental images, characterizing the actual functional state, a
      "normal" mental images is combined with the actual number of
      times, and with the group (or team leader) conduct a conversation
      about the need for change in this or that respect for stabilizing
      the shape and arrangement of mental images.<br>
      <br>
      [0021]<br>
      In the process of removing the cause of functional disorders and
      combining "normal" mental images in the group subjected to the
      actual correction of the functional state of the group is as if "a
      manifestation of" the causes of violation, ie the link group (a
      particular member of the group or unit group) begins to falter,
      which confirms the correctness of the chosen tactic for correcting
      the functional state of the group.<br>
      <br>
      [0022]<br>
      The "normal" mental images is as follows: expanding vertically
      rising along the axis T spiral with center at the origin.<br>
      <br>
      [0023]<br>
      In the study of different groups of people were analyzed groups
      involved in different businesses at the same time as mental
      images, which characterizes the actual condition of the group,
      most often occurs in the twisting of space different time forms
      (the tube, corridor, etc.), which shows the limitations of the
      case or manifested in the space rising wave interaction, reaching
      both the inner world, as well as from outside interference,
      showing a "roll forward" group on outer space, fouling the
      environment, the use of any methods in the pursuit of profit.
      Various dips and folds characterize passion only external
      interactions to the detriment of internal development that results
      in loss of benefits in any form - both material and spiritual.<br>
      <br>
      [0024]<br>
      Depending on the set during the formation of mental images, you
      can explore the different question of the matrix, "the idea of
      ??creating the company", "management and state management",
      "overall business", "financial condition". For large groups, you
      can also explore the matrix "pre-production", "state of the main
      production", "state of the implementation of the product", etc.<br>
      <br>
      [0025]<br>
      To assess the participation of a new member in the functioning of
      the group and the influence of each member of the group on its
      functioning in the various aspects of the possible combination of
      the matrices with matrix topology of the entire group as a whole.<br>
      <br>
      [0026]<br>
      The method is illustrated by the following examples.<br>
      <br>
      [0027]<br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 1 (FIG. 3a).</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Wholesale company addressed the problem of the fall sales and
      reduced profits. The study showed bioenergospetsialist surround
      mental images located in the coordinate system from which revealed
      that the normal operation of a group of people united in the
      enterprise, affects energy-twisting going from internal
      communication, running along the axis of internal communication,
      which prevents the normal functioning group. After combining
      subjected to removal of the causes of the actual mental images
      mental images with the group in the group norm (spiral expands and
      rises through the vertical axis from the origin) appeared
      differences in the leadership group. Held with the leadership of
      the group due to violation of the functional state, causing one of
      the founders left the group. After that fancies normalized - a
      good deal.<br>
      <br>
      [0028]<br>
      Example 2 (Fig. 3b).<br>
      <br>
      The team leader in the production and sale of sunflower oil is
      concerned failure group. A diagnostic survey of bioenergy
      bioenergospetsialistom. Manifesting mental images, is a spiral,
      twisted in an arc down the axis of the outgoing S (axis of
      interaction) and a wave from outside interference, which suggests
      that the group tends to get good by any means, giving the group a
      permanent loss of wealth and causing a wave of discontent
      partners. As a result of the correction of the functional state by
      removing the cause and combining "normal" and actual mental images
      revealed dissatisfaction with partners, which resulted in a
      decline in sales market and the reluctance of partners to work
      with the study group. Held with the leadership of the group,
      resulting in a change in policy regarding partners, mental images
      has stabilized, indicating the functional state of the normal
      group.<br>

      enterprise. Identified mental images along the axis of the
      well-being is of the form tightly twisted ribbon, leaving
      vertically downwards. Lowering fancies down indicates a loss of
      certain benefits. The combination of "normal" mental images with a
      valid revealed trouble in finance. In an interview with the
      management of the company was recommended to inspect all financial
      divisions of the branch that led to the identification of large
      shortages and more abuse management. After the adoption of the
      necessary measures actual mental images of the functional state of

        <b><b> </b>METHOD FOR INCREASING BIOENERGETIC VALUE OF FOOD</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      SUBSTANCE: method involves exposing food to thermal treatment by
      permanent action of energy of natural mineral weighing 300-800 g
      and having positive field determined by biological detection
      method; attaching mineral by means of metal bracket to gas line or
      to power line, with the result that all consumers become connected
      to natural mineral energy since metal of power line or gas is
      power conductor. Food prepared by mentioned method possesses
      maximum power factor, which increases individual's working
      capacity, health and longevity. Method allows food energetic value
      to be increased during preparing, including during cooking, and
      adverse effect upon individual's organism of interaction rays
      created during water boiling and possessing negative fields to be
      eliminated. So food may be prepared on gas or electric stoves or
      any other facilities. EFFECT: simplified method and improved
      quality of food<br>
      <br>
      [0001]<br>
      The invention relates to the field of human nutrition and can be
      used for heat treatment of food on gas or electric range, and any
      other devices.<br>
      <br>
      [0002]<br>
      The food, which is used daily by all the inhabitants of the planet
      Earth people, plays a central role in life, aging and death of
      every human being. She paid special attention to Cooking methods
      are constantly improved depending on the material culture of human
      rights.<br>
      <br>
      [0003]<br>
      Known method of cooking food cooking on gas and electric stoves
      such as cooking (BOGDANOVA MA et al. Catering equipment. M .:
      Economics, 1986, p.130, 181).<br>
      <br>
      [0004]<br>
      Cooking is done in water, without which there can be no life on
      earth. It is known that each person on the day you want to 1.5-2
      liters of water for drinking and 2-2.5 liters of water for
      cooking. But when boiling water is dead and acquiring a negative
      aura (determined in the process of boiling water by dowsing)
      communicates vertically with the Cosmos in any direction with the
      surrounding biological active substances (products). The man who
      had been drinking a glass of boiled water, loses some of its
      bioenergy its neutralization. Time dependent neutralization
      substance content in the stomach and is a few minutes (determined
      by dowsing near the stomach).<br>
      <br>
      [0005]<br>
      In nature, all natural products that are used for cooking, have a
      positive field, and in the process of cooking a product of the
      energy is spent on neutralization of negative field of boiling
      water. Today, due to lack of bioenergy instrumentation loss of
      bioenergy products can be identified by the value of field cooked
      food in the usual way, and under the influence of a natural
      mineral having the field. It should be noted that the performance
      of the field of the same product used may vary. It depends on the
      quality of the product itself, and the water, because Water - a
      very complicated matter, which is a mixture of many different
      substances and the end of another, as shown by studies carried
      out, it has not been studied.<br>
      <br>
      [0006]<br>
      The technical result from the use of the invention is to improve
      bioenergy value of food in the cooking process, including cooking,
      and in the elimination of harmful influence on the human body ray
      interactions which occur during boiling water and have a negative
      pitch.<br>
      <br>
      [0007]<br>
      This is solved in a method of cooking food when cooked on gas or
      electric stove, providing for a permanent impact energy of natural
      mineral weighing 300-800 grams, has a field defined by dowsing, by
      fixing it with a metal bracket to the gas network or to the
      electric wire, when This use one mineral on the gas network or one
      - to the mains.<br>
      <br>
      [0008]<br>
      Exposure is carried out during cooking plates, for example, gas.
      Applicant as a result of special experimental studies have shown
      that the energy conductors are metal, water, ores, natural gas,
      oil, et al., Which during the transfer of energy from natural
      source fields (mineral) "excited" themselves are secondary
      radiation sources, acquiring a value of the mineral field, and
      also interact vertically with the Cosmos in any direction with the
      sources of the field opposite sign.<br>
      <br>
      [0009]<br>
      From the foregoing, it follows that the pipeline and filling - gas
      environment - are conduits of energy from the natural mineral to
      consumers. Therefore, it suffices to a metal object gas network
      (gas cooker, gas pipeline, etc.), Fixed with metal brackets
      mineral weighing 300-800 grams, has a positive field is determined
      by dowsing, the entire gas network instantly becomes a secondary
      source of positive field and all that It is standing on the gas
      stove, instantly exposed to energy minerals, being charged to the
      value of its field, as evidenced by the applicant's experiments,
      which were carried out with the gas pipeline network in the
      Bukhara-Ural with the 18.08.1997 on 08.06.1998 in the city of
      Snezhinsk Chelyabinsk region and in Chelyabinsk.<br>
      <br>
      [0010]<br>
      It is known that in nature there are positive and negative field
      sources (minerals). To determine the sign of the field, using the
      two L-shaped frames provided with springs. The springs are
      designed to return the frames to the initial state in the absence
      of a field and the sliding contact between the spring and the
      frame in the field of human interaction with the natural fields.
      Studies have shown that the field can be detected by only the
      framework is the man who is endowed with the nature of the
      specific abilities - such people on planet Earth of 5-8%, which is
      enough to use a natural field for good purposes. Sign of the
      natural source of the field (mineral), the applicant determined by
      the position in space frames (1, 2, 3): 1 - a parallel (original
      state) - the field is absent; 2 - frames intersect - the existence
      of a negative sign of the field; 3 - Expenditure Framework - the
      presence of the field of positive sign.<br>
      <br>
      [0011]<br>
      This definition of sign of the field based on the results of
      personal research and intuition of the applicant.<br>
      <br>
      [0012]<br>
      Natural minerals which have positive or negative fields, eternal,
      t. To. They are constantly interacting with the cosmos and with
      each other. However, their physical destruction on the part they
      instantly neutralized.<br>
      <br>
      [0013]<br>
      It should be noted that in their interaction under the earth, or
      on the air power advantage has negative margins, but their
      physical contact with the source of negative field immediately
      neutralized.<br>

      To neutralize the negative field of boiled water, it is enough to
      put in a bowl of boiling water a little tea or coffee, etc. and as
      a result of direct contact there is a complete neutralization of
      the negative field of boiled water. It is also possible to
      neutralize the negative field of boiled water at the touch of a
      fraction of a second container with boiling water with natural
      minerals with a positive field.<br>

      In nature, everything reacts on the energy level. From the
      foregoing, it follows that it is the most cost-efficient way to
      increase the bio-energetic value of food, as Its basis is the
      energy of a priceless natural mineral. Cooked food is way above is

      SUBSTANCE: method includes performance of preliminary diagnostics
      of meridians by operator by means of biolocation methods for
      determination of energetic blocks. Diagnostics is performed by
      exposure of patient to sound, light, heat, and odor with
      simultaneous carrying out of physical exercises by using
      cylindrical spring. To this end, spring is first positioned on
      cervical section of vertebral column, and patient moves it along
      vertebral column, and then it is clamped in region of large-sized
      joints of upper and lower limbs, and patient stains muscles of
      limbs with subsequent change of position of joint surfaces.
      Physical exercises are performed in synchronism with respiration,
      and exposure to sound is performed at frequency and rhythm of
      systoles. In process of correction operator performs additional
      diagnostics repeatedly with aid of biolocation method for chancing
      the exposure parameters and selecting the spring characteristics.

      [0003]<br>
      Known methods of disease prevention and healing of the human body
      based on the creation of conditions conducive to the isolation of
      the patient from the influence of external disturbances and the
      creation of sound effects, heat, light signals, bioenergetic
      field.<br>
      <br>
      [0004]<br>
      In some prior art methods sometimes as an active factor added
      ionization environment to the patient further the influence of the
      smell, air currents, and the use biogenerator different design,
      concentrating the energy of the cosmos, bio environment and
      people.<br>

      [0005]<br>
      A method of treating diseases comprising bioenergetichsskom human
      exposure field frequency of<b> 3 - 5 MHz at a distance of 1 - 2 m</b>
      and redistribution of energy in the body by impact study using
      hand passes a field frequency of<b> 1 - 3 MHz for a distance of 30
        - 100 cm (see Fig. RF Patent 2030186</b>, from 1994).<br>
      <br>
      [0006]<br>
      Generally known methods provide relaxation problem of the patient,
      the treatment effect is insignificant and short term. The closest
      analogue bioenergetic method of disease prevention and health
      improvement of the present invention is a method in which the
      impact on the patient's heat, sound, light exposure and bioenergy
      field and perform a set of exercises with the formation of the
      motivational component in the process of being committed (VI
      Dontsov, Bioenergy human encyclopedia folio, Moscow, 1994, p. 92 -
      132).<br>
      <br>
      [0007]<br>
      The disadvantages of the known method include: a low therapeutic
      effect with a short-term effect and the prevalence of the
      relaxation component, there is no comprehensive impact due to lack
      of understanding of the mechanism of action of various factors and
      their relationships, lack of funds, defining the parameters of
      external mechanical influences, the inability to eradicate the
      negative impact of external power channels (bindings).<br>
      <br>
      [0008]<br>
      It is known that there is a category of people who have the
      ability to impact on information field of other people and objects
      that does not know about these abilities. In addition to this
      category of persons are deliberately acting on information and
      energy fields. Both groups have a pronounced ability to create
      bioenergetic connection with the fields of energy channels and
      facilities, and with the same probability of such bonds can be
      both negative and positive. When securing information links
      between these categories of persons and objects to certain
      permanent effects flipping the channels of energy influences -
      bindings that can be combined with equal probability and fields of
      biological objects (people), and the field of biological object
      with a significant object for him inanimate world or the emotional
      coloring of the situation.<br>
      <br>
      [0009]<br>
      Bioenergy correction method of the human condition of the present
      invention eliminates these drawbacks due to the fact that it is to
      conduct a preliminary diagnosis of meridians operator using
      dowsing method for determining the energy blocks, the impact on
      the patient's sound, light, heat and odor while taking exercise
      with cylindrical springs spring, which spring is first placed on
      the cervical spine and the patient carries out its movement along
      the spine, then spring is clamped in the large joints of the upper
      and lower limbs and the patient is straining muscles of the limbs,
      followed by changing the position of the articular surfaces, and
      the exercise is carried out synchronously breathing sound effects
      performed with the frequency of heart rate and rhythm, and in
      percent<br>
      <br>
      [0010]<br>
      The essence of the method according to the invention is as
      follows.<br>
      <br>
      [0011]<br>
      The effect is achieved by using resonance-wave effects, based on
      the fact that human organs and tissues have a non-uniform density,
      and therefore respond differently to the resonant frequency
      response effects. This fact creates the conditions for a strictly
      selective action on any fabric and any body, not only in general,
      but also in its structural and functional elements and education.<br>
      <br>
      [0012]<br>
      The reflected wave bioenergy allows continuous exercise dowsing
      diagnosis during the correction bioenergetic condition of the body
      by the presented method. Resonance-wave interaction in the present
      process produces cerebrospinal fluid and hemodynamic wave, which
      ensure the reconstruction of the dynamics of liquids brain while
      stimulating the recovery orientation disorganized cellular
      structures and the proper flow of energy processes in all systems
      and structural units of the organism as a whole and of the
      musculoskeletal system in Specifically. The most convincing proof
      of the effectiveness of the method used is to reduce muscle
      hypertonus and a significant improvement of peripheral functions
      that take place at such influences.<br>
      <br>
      [0013]<br>
      Consider the mechanism of action of the present method for more.
      Sound, light, heat, bioenergy and the impact of odor impact by
      specifying the manipulation of spatial movements of individual
      parts of the spine and other segments of the musculoskeletal
      system of the patient, as well as vibrational and electromagnetic
      interference from external mechanical generator generate
      mechanical vibration waves in conducting media body. Dynamic
      change of parameters of influence by external mechanical generator
      and specific provisions of certain parts of the musculoskeletal
      system set the parameters of the waves, such as amplitude and
      intensity, propagation direction and frequency characteristics.
      Mezhorgannye and intraorgan cavities and interstitial capillary
      gap provide an opportunity to form a vibrational wave is very
      complex configuration, the ability to penetrate any given part of
      the body or organ. Reaching the target, causing a wave of this
      section as if the local micro-explosion, shattering spikes, making
      razvoloknenie and separation of tissue, breaking the salt formed
      by eliminating blocks, plugs, power clamps, etc. This ensures
      continuity from procedure to procedure structuring and restore
      damaged tissue and replenish energy body or body part. Along with
      the destruction and elimination of pathological changes in the
      tissues occurs parallel restoration of their functional physical
      and energetic properties.<br>
      <br>
      [0014]<br>
      When the bioenergetic exercises in accordance with the present
      process also occurs automatically massage the acupuncture points
      of the body, the effects of which improves skin tone and improves
      the immune system of the whole body, there is an independent
      editing position of the vertebrae and intervertebral discs.<br>
      <br>
      [0015]<br>
      The first and main objective of this process is to eliminate the
      reasons, which do not allow the energy to circulate freely and
      uniformly in the body. These reasons include any factors that
      prevent a person to improve their energy state (salt deposits,
      deformation and displacement of the vertebrae and intervertebral
      discs, fear and other negative emotions). Given the current
      understanding of the power of perception and distribution of the
      electromagnetic energy in the meridians of the human body, the
      present method eliminates the following causes of disease: produce
      energy gap bindings and connections biopathogenic energy level
      OPRRNA field of human and fundamental energy meridians, eliminate
      energy clip - overlapping channel or meridian of energy, remove
      the physical unit - muscle paralysis, salt deposition, the
      formation of stones, sand, etc., to remove the energy binding the
      main channels and meridians person associated with biopathogenic
      and geopathic influence, relieve nerve blocks - a nervous
      breakdown, overvoltage, eliminate psychological block - stress ,
      emotional breakdown, depression.<br>
      <br>
      [0016]<br>
      Elimination of nervous and mental blocks and external energy gap
      bindings from the main meridians and OPRRNA field of human
      restores the continuity of energy feedback and integrity of the
      information field of the patient.<br>
      <br>
      [0017]<br>
      Open feedback and education of energy binding occurs under the
      influence of earlier negative energies. Energy tube form blocks
      that, together with bindings cause impaired function of specific
      organs and further adversely affect the dynamics of the general
      state of the organism.<br>
      <br>
      [0018]<br>
      The resulting blocks and binding energy and geopathic
      biopathogenic effects do not allow energy to circulate properly
      and evenly throughout the body and get it outside of any existing
      sources of additional energy (music, flowers, plants, animals,
      etc.). The most effective way to eliminate the blocks and binding
      energy associated with such common diseases as sciatica, low back
      pain, nerve diseases, diseases of the immune system and a
      malfunction in the power unit of the body due to external
      pathogenic influences the nature of information and energy.<br>
      <br>
      [0019]<br>
      One of the main achievements of this method is that each exercise
      will involve the maximum number of muscles and structures of the
      energy field, so harmful substances, products of metabolism and
      negative energy have nowhere to stay and they are actively removed
      from the body of the patient and OPRRNA field.<br>
      <br>
      [0020]<br>
      The second advantage of the method according to the invention -
      cleansing the energy channels of the subtle bodies and structures,
      that subsequently leads to the purification of the body and its
      recovery. This is achieved by exposure to external mechanical
      oscillator and an external oscillator bioenergy field.<br>
      <br>
      [0021]<br>
      Slagging and fouling the energy channels of the body takes place
      every day under the influence of food intake, thoughts, feelings
      and emotions in relation to the situation and the people coming
      into the verbal and energy contact. If such negative effects, the
      level of physical and chemical reactions in the body are formed
      toxic substance contaminating organism at the cellular level. The
      negative impact of the energy field of the person affected OPRRNA
      main channels and meridians and energy flow, which leads to the
      formation of the binding energy between the patient and the
      objects of the external world, the emergence of traffic jams and
      blocks in the way of flowing normally in the human body energy.<br>
      <br>
      [0022]<br>
      Set of exercises together with other actions that are used in the
      present process, can actively excrete toxins and replacing
      contaminated clean energy. In addition, the work includes not work
      before or blocked energy centers. The body begins to consume no
      energy and radiate it outward. There is an internal harmonization
      of the body and the person begins to have a positive impact on the
      world around us.<br>
      <br>
      [0023]<br>
      A third advantage of the process according to the invention - to
      achieve a uniform distribution of energy throughout the body. To
      do this, in many exercises used smooth and plastic movement with
      cylindrical springs spring, distributes energy in the human body
      and the effects of the external oscillator. The elimination of the
      binding energy associated with the adverse effects of
      geopathogenic zones and the environment, including humans, also
      leads to a uniform distribution of energy in the human aura and
      eliminates channel leakage power of OPRRNA field.<br>
      <br>
      [0024]<br>
      The basis of the method consists of exercise, clearing the spine
      and almost all the major muscle groups: the back, chest, abdomen,
      neck, muscles of the upper and lower extremities. As a result, a
      complete study of the complex improves circulation and recharge
      the body's energy. The active work involved almost the entire
      skeleton and all joints, all parts of the spinal column. Exercise
      combined with breathing exercises, psihokontsentratsiey, the
      influence of external mechanical oscillator and bioenergy field
      normalize the process of excitation and inhibition in the cerebral
      cortex, thereby providing therapeutic and curative effect on the
      human body as a whole. Exercising without mental concentration and
      without synchronization with the respiration parameters and the
      impact of external generator does not have the desired effect on
      the body.<br>
      <br>
      [0025]<br>
      Synchronization with the parameters of breathing and the influence
      of external generators improves muscle tone, work vessels,
      normalization of the nervous system, reducing the cholesterol
      content in the blood, removes the negative energy from the body
      and nourishes it with positive energy. An important role in the
      implementation of the proposed ways to play pause of the
      respiratory cycle, during which by specifying certain spatial
      movements and the combination of tension and relaxation of certain
      muscle groups to saturate the body with energy and the partial
      elimination of the bindings.<br>
      <br>
      [0026]<br>
      In addition to these influences an important role in removing
      negative energy factors and bringing the body back to normal
      energy state plays a range of colors, to the patient during the
      session, the health of the present process.<br>
      <br>
      [0027]<br>
      In the muscular system positively influenced red on blood - green,
      airway corresponds to the color blue, the skeletal system - blue,
      orange acts on the sexual sphere, and genitourinary system, yellow
      - on the nervous system, purple - in the endocrine glands.<br>

      Consider the mechanism of bio-energetic way of prevention and
      healing of the human body according to the invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0030]<br>
      According to the present method on the patient affect the resonant
      wave action by defining the spatial movements of the individual
      segments of the spine and other parts of the musculoskeletal
      system. The patient is affected simultaneously and oscillating
      electromagnetic field from external mechanical oscillator is
      constructed as a cylindrical spring the spring. The length of the
      coil spring 20 - 60 cm, diameter - 5 - 30 cm diameter spiral - 2 -
      10 mm, the number of turns is 5 - 20. The coil spring may be made
      of any metal, such as steel, copper. External mechanical generator
      in conjunction with the patient forms a complex oscillatory
      system. When the spatial movements of the cylindrical coil spring
      makes microvibrations that at certain joints come for the entire
      musculoskeletal system and its individual segments.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 4 shows graphs of oscillation modes created by external
      mechanical oscillator. These vibrations are composed of
      low-frequency vibrations, high-frequency and high-frequency
      oscillations superimposed. Thus it is able to achieve
      resonance-wave effects on the human body, and the individual
      segments of the musculoskeletal system of the patient under the
      influence of other external disturbances. Selecting and setting
      the mode effects due to resonant wave action, you can remove the
      obstacles in the form of disturbances and blocks in the body,
      preventing the normal and proper dissemination of energy in the
      meridians.<br>
      <br>
      [0031]<br>
      The complex exercise set so as to influence them and the impact of
      external mechanical generator in resonance. In addition to the
      vibrational effects of external mechanical oscillator has on the
      patient's electromagnetic effects due to the concentration of
      electromagnetic environmental studies, including the energy of the
      cosmos. And this electromagnetic effect on the patient overlaps
      the committed action of complex rhythmic exercises and the impact
      of well-defined external vibrations in the form of color, heat,
      sound, odor influences. These effects give rise to the primary
      mechanical waves in conducting media of the body, providing
      revitalizing effect. Parameters external oscillator are selected
      in such a manner that due to its elastic properties can be formed
      of different oscillatory motions of frequency and amplitude.<br>
      <br>
      [0032]<br>
      The method is applied as follows.<br>
      <br>
      [0033]<br>
      At the beginning of diagnosing a patient with the help of dowsing
      using the framework of conventional construction on major
      bioenergy meridians, with fixed places of education power plugs,
      power and continuity of energy ties, as well as places of
      education energy bindings.<br>
      <br>
      [0034]<br>
      Thereafter, the patient cervical spine located on the external
      mechanical generator, made in the form of a coil spring. Ask the
      movement of the generator along the longitudinal axis of the
      patient. Then, a cylindrical spring spring clamped in the large
      joints of the upper and lower extremities. When the friction
      spring on the skin massage is performed periarticular tissues, for
      example, at the level of the spinal column. Straining certain
      muscle groups, the patient presses the coil spring to the body,
      thereby acting plunging deep into the soft tissue elements and
      carrying their stimulation and correction of surrounding joints.
      This results in relaxation of spastic muscles and ligaments, blood
      vessels to dilate, increasing the conductivity of nerve fibers to
      the surrounding tissues. Cyclically repeating the above-described
      movement, the patient rhythmically massages the periarticular
      tissue, alternating massage with position correction of the
      articular surfaces. In the present method retains the traditional
      types of wave action - sound, light, heat, odor impacts.<br>
      <br>
      [0035]<br>
      Since the spine is the foundation of the energy of our body, the
      main parameters of the resonant wave action define a set of
      exercises using a cylindrical spring spring. At the same time from
      an external generator receives the mechanical oscillations whose
      frequency and amplitude are also dependent on the applied set of
      exercises and the inner resonating frequency and amplitude of the
      metal itself. During the exercise seeking to achieve
      synchronization of the parameters of breathing. This
      synchronization (duration, depth of breathing, rhythm, etc..)
      Allows you to create the most favorable conditions for the
      occurrence of resonance-wave processes in the body of the patient
      in general and the cardiovascular system in particular. Along with
      the resonant wave action on the body of the patient from an
      external mechanical generator receives electromagnetic influence
      due to the accumulation of electromagnetic fields of the
      environment, including the energy of the cosmos.<br>
      <br>
      [0036]<br>
      In contrast to the stimuli for the perception that there are
      specialized receptors alternating magnetic field, having a large
      penetrating action can simultaneously affect different tissues.
      However, due to the sensitivity of different tissues and organs,
      and also due to the inclusion of reparative processes, the overall
      response of the body changes at different stages of the impact.
      But in all phases of it involved the central nervous system as the
      main regulator of the central link of the chain response. <br>
      <br>
      [0037]<br>
      The electromagnetic field, causing a variety of sensations,
      changing the electrical activity of the brain (particularly the
      hypothalamus and the cortex), affects the process of formation of
      skills, information storage and its playback, it changes the
      emotional and volitional violates cerebral function devices,
      vascular regulation, changes hematological and biochemical
      parameters. Therefore necessary to optimize the electromagnetic
      characteristics of the environment with parameters corresponding
      to the needs of the body in the performance of an activity, ie,
      You need some kind of electromagnetic comfort.<br>
      <br>
      [0038]<br>
      According to the present method, the patient is affected mild
      irritant nature of bioenergy, the intensity of which varies from
      10-12 to 10-15 W / cm2. For this purpose the external bioenergetic
      field generator, which is under the same environmental conditions
      as the patient. Options impacts that come from an external
      oscillator bioenergy, change to ensure resonance with all other
      influences.<br>
      <br>
      [0039]<br>
      Bioenergy effect eliminates those blocks and binding energy, which
      can not be removed by other types of impacts. In the process of
      the method is carried out biolocation of the main energy channels,
      meridians and change the parameters of the external generator
      bioenergy field, its frequency and amplitude until the fixing
      using dowsing separation energy bindings and eliminate blocks in
      various parts of the body and the patient OPRRNA field.<br>
      <br>
      [0040]<br>
      As decision block that controls assignment modes effects generator
      may be used with the computer. In its absence, this function can
      be performed by the operator. The source forming light, heat,
      sound effects and smell generators are used widely applied, for
      example such as in the analogs. The mechanism of their effect is
      similar to the patient PA.<br>
      <br>
      [0041]<br>
      Impact sound is selected according to the frequency and rhythm of
      heart contractions involved, with the result that anyone can do
      the exercises at their own pace. When the coincidence of human
      vibration and rhythm of music resonance occurs, at which the
      energy is added and there is an optimal selection of rhythmic
      effects. Using a variety of musical styles and genres, as well as
      the sounds of ritual character - the ringing bells, tambourine,
      tom-toms, etc. It allows you to choose the optimal resonance
      frequency corresponding to the organisms of different age groups
      involved. Here the music plays the role of an additional source of
      energy guide. Under the influence of the resonant effect of energy
      supply takes place internal organs, alteration of the nervous
      system and psychological perception of a person.<br>
      <br>
      [0042]<br>
      The main influence in determining the rhythmic and wave effects on
      the body, is a complex exercise with external mechanical
      oscillator and the impact of external bioenergetichesskogo
      generator, the impact of which depends on the kind of violations
      in the human body and the localization of energy blocks and
      bindings in the information and energy field of the patient.<br>
      <br>
      [0043]<br>
      The preventive effect and improvement of the body of this method
      is provided by the participation of all the biochemical and
      psychological processes - namely, memory, sensation, perception,
      attention, representation, imagination, thought and emotion.
      Although these aspects of human activity are manifested only in
      the aggregate, the optimal conditions during the process of
      prevention and healing the body as a whole depends on the specific
      conditions of flow and formation of each of these processes.
      However, the determining influence on the formation and management
      of these processes has a rhythm, because the rhythm is inseparable
      from the person who is the conductor of the rhythmic
      manifestations in all aspects of biological, psychological and
      social life and self-synchronization of oscillating systems and
      organs.<br>
      <br>
      [0044]<br>
      Hence the rhythm should be considered as the material basis of two
      components of human activity - the knowledge and actions with
      indirect effects on respiration, circulation and internal
      secretion, which in turn will create a field of activity of
      emotions, as well as exciting, supports and enriches the
      association, causing a pleasant feeling of regularity and general
      stabilization.<br>
      <br>
      [0045]<br>
      The periodicity and rhythm are characteristic of all mental
      processes, then in solving optimization problems of prevention and
      healing the body there is a need in a meaningful change in this
      frequency, ie, in its management. The sound of music and the
      rhythm of the different rhythmically composed phrases and phrases
      (conspiracies, prayers), the perceived audio analyzer has a strong
      and direct impact on the process of formation and organization of
      the rhythmic characteristics of the body, including the permit to
      reprogram certain abnormal rhythms and lead them to the rhythmic
      manifestations ozdoravlivayuschim .<br>

      Visual rhythm perceived visually is embodied in a linear space and
      in a plane in a uniform alternation of certain forms, their
      interconnections in various optical phenomena. Linear thrust
      rhythm is embodied in the schedule. This method involves the use
      of signs and graphic constructions for the selection and inclusion
      of certain visual rhythmic direction.<br>
      <br>
      [0047]<br>
      Touch specifies the impression of rhythm and affects perception is
      stronger than the rhythm perceived auditory or visual analyzer.
      The sense of touch is activating factor for the perception of
      rhythm and his way of direct transfer to humans. In practicing the
      method of the present invention, the construction of rhythmic
      tactile feedback is carried out via a cylindrical spring spring
      which carries in its structure laid via the number of turns, their
      frequency and the diameter of the tactile rhythm.<br>
      <br>
      [0048]<br>
      These examples clearly shows that factors synchronizing biological
      processes may make light, temperature, electromagnetic and
      bioenergetic field, music, poetry, the influence of external
      mechanical generators, the rhythm of graphic images, etc.<br>
      <br>
      [0049]<br>
      We can say that the study point to the fact legitimate
      biopotentials restructuring, which resulted in the application of
      all these factors establishes certain ritmoobrazuyuschih tuned to
      the rhythm of recovery of the central nervous system and brain. To
      do this set of exercises, visual, auditory, olfactory factors and
      the influence of electromagnetic and bioenergetic fields, coupled
      with the restoration of the state of the energy body can be
      likened to a presentation of the positive potential of great
      power, causing processes in different parts of the cortex begin to
      flow is similar, that is, the combination of synchronized actions
      results in effect of a mechanism, in turn clock rhythmic activity
      of the cortex, and this ability has only a positive signal.<br>
      <br>
      [0050]<br>
      All of the above suggests that the need for and effectiveness of
      complex clock influences the organization of disease prevention
      and health improvement is not currently in doubt.<br>
      <br>
      [0051]<br>
      Above the mechanism of action of certain influences. The high
      efficiency of the method of correction bioenergetic state of the
      person of the present invention is achieved by compliance with the
      general principles of the known interaction of systems: the
      principle of resonance, the principle of self-synchronization of
      oscillating systems.<br>
      <br>
      [0052]<br>
      At present, mechanisms of action of individual disturbances
      sufficiently substantiated. However, an integrated management and
      the impact of this exposure with sufficient efficacy is lacking.
      Therefore, the novelty of the proposed method differs from
      previously known. High efficiency is achieved by way of the
      following characterizing method of the invention: the complex of
      exercises corresponding to specific diseases and disorders
      bioenergy defining spatial movement of certain segments of the
      musculoskeletal system using cylindrical springs spring, which in
      combination with the rhythmic sound and wave effects, light, heat,
      electromagnetic and bioenergetic resonance effects is salutary
      effect on the human body as a whole and the individual organs and
      tissues, the optimal system is designed to eliminate the external
      radiation on the human biofield by removing blocks in the energy
      meridians and pathological fracture energy human binding to
      specific objects and biopathogenic geopathogenic characterthe
      process of learning the spatial movements of the musculoskeletal
      system, the implementation process of movement is brought to
      automaticity, to achieve sustainable resonant wave action that is
      by focusing on the patient's morbid thoughts organ or body part
      comes in these parts of the body, causing a therapeutic and
      prophylactic effect.<br>
      <br>
      [0053]<br>
      As a result of the invention: heals the physical body, its organs
      and systems, there is a cleansing energy meridians of the blocks,
      which leads to the correct flow of energy processes and
      interactions of organs and tissues, the human energy field is
      released from the external energy bindings that allows you to
      direct the released energy in recovery organism and the
      optimization of the brain, through the application of external
      mechanical oscillator going optimization of the muscular system
      and joints, eliminates external pathogenic effects on the human

      nervous system to achieve positive agreed perception and
      evaluation of reality.<br>

      The application describes a method of disease prevention and
      health improvement allows already after the first session to
      increase the mobility of the skeleton, to feel the positive
      effects of reprogramming rhythm perception of the situation, bring

        <b> METHOD OF HOMEOPATHIC PREPARATION SELECTION</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      FIELD: medicine, homeopathy. SUBSTANCE: patient keeps glass filled
      with physiological solution in palm. Then solution sample is
      applied and distributed uniformly on slide, dried and
      crystallographic pattern is estimated under microscope. For
      distinction of crystalline picture from the normal one that fills
      light snow flakes with centered clear crystal and light concentric
      circles the central matured crystals show increased turbidity and
      concentric circles are more "heavy", mineralized. Patient keeps
      glass filled with physiological solution in one hand and
      homeopathic preparation to be tested in another hand. Then
      crystals are isolated from physiological solution by indicated
      method and the homeopathic preparation is considered to be useful
      for treatment of this patient if crystalline picture is
      normalized. Method is based on bioenergetic principle. EFFECT:
      objectivity of method.<br>
      <br>
      [0001]<br>
      The invention relates to medicine and concerns the selection of
      homeopathic drugs in the treatment of various diseases.<br>
      <br>
      [0002]<br>
      At different times, different theories were proposed to explain
      the mechanisms of homeopathy. The first was Hahnemann. He was one
      of those thinkers who spoke of the existence of a fine substance,
      called them "vital force", which organizes and animates all forms
      of matter. Goethe also wrote about "the life-giving forces of
      nature", according to these views the world as a whole and all its
      parts are imbued with some kind of matter, subtle enough to grasp
      and inaccessible. Hahnemann believed that all drugs containing
      this kind of power, but in the natural form in which they are
      found in nature, this delicate matter related more or less active.
      Seeing the increased activity of the drug as a result of
      successive dilutions Hahnemann suggested that this "life force"
      medicine more relieved. The same kind of matter - the life force -
      there are in man. It was she, for Hahnemann, weakened, and this is
      the essence of the disease. The vital force of the body is the
      point of application of homeopathic medicines.<br>
      <br>
      [0003]<br>
      With the advent of information theory and the concept of the
      concept were considering homeopathic treatment, as information
      impacts under which influence the body's self-regulating
      cybernetic systems independently restore the disturbed
      equilibrium. This opinion is in itself is true, but questions
      about the current beginning, the point of application, the
      mechanisms of interaction and the first link of the healing
      process remains open to this day.<br>
      <br>
      [0004]<br>
      Currently, the standard is an information-energetic hologram
      theory of homeopathy (NK Simeonova, 1993), based on the concept of
      homeopathic medicine and the human body as a hologram and
      resonance between them.<br>
      <br>
      [0005]<br>
      The general form of medicine known that drugs should be used,
      focusing on the individual sensitivity of the patient, but in
      practice this is not happening. The fact that a drug for this
      patient was helpful, harmful or useless, learn later, is not rare
      at great cost to the patient and the authority of medicine.<br>
      <br>
      [0006]<br>
      You must have a clear direction and know in advance the
      sensitivity of the patient to the drug.<br>
      <br>
      [0007]<br>
      The annotations to the use of allopathic drugs are no indications
      of the type of patients who have a risk of side effects. Abstract
      contains a list of indications, contraindications and side
      effects. By contrast, in classical homeopathy medicines response
      begins with a description of the type of sensitive people, then -
      reading. There are no contraindications and side effects is not -
      another type of medication the patient will not act at all.
      However, there are certain difficulties in determining the
      constitutional types and homeopaths, that is, from our point of
      view, a deterrent to the development of homeopathy among general
      practitioners.<br>
      <br>
      [0008]<br>
      In order to overcome these difficulties - namely the definition of
      the patient's constitution and selection of appropriate drugs, and
      objective monitoring of their performance, now there are several
      ways. It is the creation of computer programs, allowing for a
      relatively short time to interview patients and give advice on the
      appointment of the preparations, the reception of which is
      appropriate in this case. Broad popular method of diagnosis by
      Voll. Various methods and techniques that help homeopathic
      preparation of recipes, such as iridology (Mikheyev AV). There are
      known methods of selection of drugs on the energy principle
      (Yu.M.Zalesskaya RU 2074637 C1, 10/03/97). All of these approaches
      are informative, some are standardized and greatly enhance the
      efficiency of the homeopath.<br>
      <br>
      [0009]<br>
      The effectiveness of all existing auxiliary methods in homeopathy
      should be assessed according to their ability to combine the
      account the individual characteristics of a particular patient at
      a particular time on the one hand, and objective assessment - on
      the other. The object of the present invention is to provide such
      a test which would be highly effective, it has been given
      objective and quick results.<br>
      <br>
      [0010]<br>
      The invention is based crystallographic method.<br>
      <br>
      [0011]<br>
      This method was elaborated Pfeiffer in 1935 and called "sensitive
      crystallisation". This is not about quantity, but about
      qualitative methods. The principle of the method is comparable to
      the visualization of the magnetic field. It is known that if a
      piece of paper with crumbled iron filings put the magnet, the
      filings on paper form a characteristic pattern corresponding to
      the direction of the magnetic field strength. So, if in a
      supersaturated solution of salt to add a few drops of extract of
      living substance, we see that the crystals precipitated from
      solution also give a certain picture, which reflects not only the
      properties of inorganic salts (crystals themselves), but also a
      modification of the action of the etheric forces studied organic
      substance. The similarity with the method of imaging the magnetic
      field is only external analogy. Figure magnetic field is always
      the same, whereas the sensitive crystallization gives a virtually
      infinite variety of patterns. However, with some experience, can
      find crystalline structure essentially similar patterns, allowing
      to use this method to practical needs.<br>
      <br>
      [0012]<br>
      Crystallographic method is used in pharmacology and forensic
      medicine. Known for its use to detect changes in food (MP Kuzmin,
      NV Galkin, 1964). In the 80s the method is widely used in
      medicine, but it was considered only as an auxiliary diagnostic
      physical and chemical test. As a result, cerebrospinal fluid,
      urine, sputum, saliva, ascites, tumor pieces were attempts to
      differentiate the nature of the pathological process (tumor,
      inflammatory, allergic). In the most accessible form of this
      method was used in the MONICA them. Vladimir (LA Frost et al,
      1981).<br>
      <br>
      [0013]<br>
      In the traditional version of the method used to obtain crystals
      of copper chloride (CuCl2). In 1985, in order to simplify the
      method of crystallography IL Theodore and colleagues began to use
      saline solution (0,9% NaCI). The results obtained by the author,
      is very informative, but their interpretation was limited solely
      to the search for geometric differences in crystallographic
      patterns in patients with different pathologies.<br>
      <br>
      [0014]<br>
      The closest analogue is the way of selection of homeopathic
      remedies for the bioenergy principle, for example, the sample
      "ring" test "key power" and so on, based on the change in muscle
      tone in his hands when dealing with the test drug or the
      appearance parestezy contactless tests. The main disadvantage of
      these methods - a subjective assessment of both doctors and
      patient test results. The objective of the present invention - to
      overcome this drawback, an objective diagnosis of information and
      the human energy field and selecting the appropriate homeopathic
      remedies that restore normal crystallographic picture,
      respectively age norm.<br>
      <br>
      [0015]<br>
      To solve the problem of selection of homeopathic drugs, the
      patient stands in the palm of a glass cup with saline, then saline
      sample applied on a slide, dried, and evaluated microscopically
      crystallographic pattern. The patient stands in one hand beaker of
      saline, and the other - with a test drug, more crystals were
      isolated from the saline solution by the above method and in the
      normalization pattern crystal homeopathic preparation suitable for
      the treatment of a given patient.<br>
      <br>
      [0016]<br>
      Thus saline employed in an amount of 20-30 ml of room temperature
      saline, the patient stands and the drug in the palm for 10
      minutes. In addition, the sample was dried for 20 - 27 minutes at
      room temperature and incubated for 5 - 7 minutes at 37 - 41oC.<br>
      <br>
      [0017]<br>
      Evaluation crystallographic pattern is performed under the light
      microscope at a magnification of 56 times.<br>
      <br>
      [0018]<br>
      The subject takes in hand and compresses it glass cup with 20-30
      ml of saline at room temperature. After a 10-minute exposure with
      a laboratory pipette is taken a few drops of saline solution from
      said cup and applied onto a clean glass slide on which the saline
      solution is distributed uniformly, after which the glass remains
      dry at room temperature (about 25 minutes) and placed in an oven (
      temperature from 37 to 41oC) for 5-7 minutes. Qualification
      crystallographic pattern is made under a light microscope at a
      magnification of 56 times.<br>
      <br>
      [0019]<br>
      It is found that physically healthy people young and middle age
      have information energy field capable absolutely certain,
      characteristically contactlessly affect the salt solution so that
      its crystals are oriented in space, form a typical pattern
      resembling a snowflake with light transparent crystal in the
      center and light concentric circles. In people more mature central
      crystals tend to be more cloudy and more concentric circles
      "heavy" mineralized. At the corpses of people who have been tested
      for 3 days from the date of death, the central crystals found
      muddy and rough, rezkoocherchennye concentric circles, indicating
      that the sharp weakening of the clearing-energy field, or by using
      an esoteric terminology, we can talk about the separation of the
      etheric body physical.<br>
      <br>
      [0020]<br>
      They were examined patients with various pathological conditions.
      In all cases, the presence of physical illness crystallographic
      pattern different from normal. The regularities in crystallograms,
      lets talk about the typical crystallographic manifestations of
      pathological processes. <br>
      <br>
      [0021]<br>
      Selection of drugs is as follows. After initial studies
      crystallogram, the subject takes a cup in one hand with saline, as
      described above, and the other - with the test drug vial. After 10
      minutes of saline crystals are prepared by the above program and
      evaluated. In cases where there is a normalization of the crystal
      under the influence of the drug picture, the conclusion about the
      necessity of his appointment to the patient. In the absence of the
      effect of the drug on crystallograms need for the appointment of
      the drug there. This test can also be used in cases where it is
      necessary to answer the question whether further needs the drug,
      or its impact is over. In accordance with the information and
      energy hologram theory this effect is due to the occurrence of
      resonance between the body and medicine. If there is no response,
      no drug has no action and crystallograms not changed.<br>
      <br>
      [0022]<br>
      Thus, the proposed crystallographic test is simple to perform. For
      its implementation does not require a special long-term training.
      To test requires the use of conventional light microscope slides,
      pipettes, glass and saline. In the absence of a thermostat glass
      can be dried at room temperature, which takes 15-20 minutes
      longer. Glass crystals are stored for a long time, which allows
      complex or controversial cases to review them, consult with
      colleagues to compile a rare, interesting observations, etc<br>

      SUBSTANCE: method consists in the fact that before the
      construction of building on the country determined are the
      direction of the geographic poles, magnitude and direction of the
      earth's magnetic field, location of geopathogenic zones, blocking
      of the geopathogenic zones is accomplished in the place of the
      supposed construction, selected are the place for building
      construction, its location, arrangement of partitions inside the
      building, building and finishing materials, items of interior and
      furniture with due account for psychophysiologic state of people,
      who will live or work in the building. The psychophysiologic state
      of people is determined due to finding of the integral index of
      intensity by measuring the respiration rate, pulse rate and
      indices of cutaneogalvanic reaction with the aid of the methods of
      biolocation, analysis of birth gyroscopes. At construction
      selected are the relation of the geometric dimensions of the
      building, story jobs are carried out with due account for the
      lunar month, and on completion of construction the purpose of the
      rooms is determined with the aid of the methods of biolocation. On
      the territory adjacent to the building the effect of the
      geopathogenic zones is blocked by implantation in their center of
      trees of the species accumulating the natural energy, or by
      covering of their location by mineral energy concentrators, for
      example, granite crushed rock or white sand with a pad thickness
      up to 0.8 m, and on the adjacent territory arranged are plants and
      landscape object accumulating the cosmic energy and providing for
      weakening of negative effects of the geomagnetic field on the

      Known methods of providing bioenergetic ecology of detecting
      geopathic zones Earth's magnetic field, in the blocking effects of
      these zones through the use of protective screens made of metals
      (aluminum, copper) from minerals and indoor use generators that
      create opposing electromagnetic fields (see. USSR Author's
      Certificate 1311740, A 61 N 1/16).<br>
      <br>
      [0003]<br>
      However, the known methods have the following disadvantages: not
      intended for use over large areas of residential buildings, as
      they allow to provide the necessary level of protection only in
      limited quantities; intended only for use in the medical purposes
      and are used in the medical and research institutions; They are
      expensive, making them difficult to use on a large scale in the
      individual housing and industrial construction; do not eliminate
      the harmful effects of certain energy fields, especially acting on
      the psycho-physiological state of a person; have low efficiency
      associated with a short stay in a shielded room;It has a limited
      time to achieve a healthy, protective effect is due to the
      impossibility of permanent human conditions created in a
      protective environment; do not consider the possibility of
      providing bioenergy environmental protection by creating OPRRNA

      finished housing or apartment during the repair.<br>
      <br>
      [0005]<br>
      The present invention overcomes these disadvantages by the fact
      that the way to ensure that bioenergy environmental building is
      characterized in that before the construction of the building on
      the ground determine the direction of the geographic poles, the
      magnitude and direction of the magnetic field of the Earth, the
      location of geopathogenic zones of geopathic zones to lock in
      place of the proposed construction, choose a place for the
      construction of the building and its location, placement of
      partitions inside the building, construction and decoration
      materials, furnishings and furniture with the psycho-physiological
      state of people who will live or work in the building;
      psychophysiological state of people is determined by finding the
      integral index of tension by measuring respiration rate,pulse rate
      and performance galvanic skin response; psychophysiological state
      of people is determined by dowsing techniques; psychophysiological
      state of people is determined by analysis of the horoscope of
      birth; selected aspect ratio of the building, its length to width,
      based on a ratio of 2: 3 to 10:10 meters; floor work is carried
      out taking into account the period of the lunar month; on
      completion using dowsing techniques determine the intended use of
      the premises; on the territory adjacent to the building block the
      effects of geopathic zones by planting them in the center of tree
      species, accumulating the natural energy, or backfilling their
      locations mineral concentrators of energy, such as granite rubble
      or white sand cushion thickness of up to 0.8 meters; placed at a
      location nearby plants and landscape items, accumulating cosmic<br>

      The main objective of this process is to eliminate the reasons,
      which do not allow the energy to circulate freely and uniformly in
      humans. These reasons include any impediments to the normal flow
      of energy flows (salt deposits, fear, negative emotions, weakened
      immune system, etc.) and cause breakage of the reverse energy
      ties. Open inverse energy ties also occurs under the influence of
      the previously obtained the natural background and artificially
      induced negative energy species. Power plugs cause dysfunction of
      specific organs in the future adversely affect the condition of
      the body as a whole, not allowing energy to circulate evenly
      throughout the body and to the body - get energy from other
      sources. Given the current understanding of the distribution of
      the electromagnetic and biological energy in the human body, the
      present method eliminates the following causes of disease and
      deterioration of mental and emotional background (remove the
      "blocks" in the body): Energy - overlapping channel (meridian)
      flowing energy, physical block - paralysis or muscle contracture,
      salt deposits, the formation of stones, sand and other diseases
      related to slagging of the body, the mental block - stress factor,
      emotional breakdown, depression, nerve blocks - exhaustion of the
      nervous system in general, fatigue, insomnia, etc. condition<br>
      <br>
      [0007]<br>
      Elimination of nervous and mental blocks ensures the recovery of
      dangling power feedback. Most effectively, this method eliminates
      the lock associated with nervous stress, exhaustion of the nervous
      system, chronic fatigue syndrome, psychosomatic diseases of
      internal organs.<br>
      <br>
      [0008]<br>
      Another advantage of the present method of the invention is the
      purification of the energy channels of the subtle bodies and
      structures, which leads to a complex cleansing effect on the
      body's energy, and then to the improvement of the human body at
      the level of thin components, and at the level of the physical
      body.<br>
      <br>
      [0009]<br>
      Under the influence of high-frequency components of the magnetic
      field of the Earth, cosmic rays, geopathic zones at the level of
      physical and chemical reactions in the body produces toxic
      substances that carry the body and contaminating it on the
      cellular and energetic level. Perform the steps for this method
      allows you to actively remove toxins from the body and replace
      contaminated clean energy. In addition, the work includes not
      functioning or previously blocked energy centers. The body begins
      to consume no energy and radiate it outward. There is an internal
      harmonization of the body and the person begins to have a positive
      impact on the world around us.<br>
      <br>
      [0010]<br>
      A third advantage of the process according to the invention - to
      achieve a uniform distribution of energy throughout the body.<br>
      <br>
      [0011]<br>
      Electromagnetic fields have the following biotropic indicators:
      intensity gradient vector, frequency, pulse shape, localization.
      Analysis of the impact of electromagnetic fields should be divided
      on the impact analysis of the magnetic and electric components.
      The non-uniform electromagnetic fields have a more pronounced
      biological activity than the homogeneous, and the vertical
      direction of the lines of force is more effective horizontal.
      Variable magnetic fields induce nonspecific reactions which are
      detected at the level of the whole organism, and at the level of
      the central nervous system and neuronal cell formation in
      particular. In contrast to the stimuli for the perception that
      there are specialized receptors alternating magnetic field, having
      a large penetrating action can simultaneously affect different
      tissues. However, due to the different sensitivity of tissues and
      organs, and also due to the inclusion of reparative processes that
      change the overall response of the body at different stages of
      exposure.<br>
      <br>
      [0012]<br>
      But at every stage it has been actively involved the central
      nervous system as a central regulator of the main link of the
      chain of responses. Considering the confining effects, such as the
      brain, it may be noted that in addition to the nerve cells in
      response to the electromagnetic field are switched on and glial
      elements, which part causes the appearance of slow oscillations in
      the electrical activity of the brain. Characteristically, these
      changes arise with long latent period continues for a long time
      after the end of exposure, and often accompanied by a predominance
      of inhibition in the central nervous system.<br>
      <br>
      [0013]<br>
      The electromagnetic field changes the electrical activity of the
      brain, particularly the hypothalamus and the cortex, affects the
      processes of formation of skills, processes, information storage
      in brain structures and its reproduction, change emotional and
      volitional, dysfunction of the cerebral apparatus, it causes
      restoration and connecting dysfunction, hematological and
      biochemical changes indicators. Therefore necessary to optimize
      the electromagnetic characteristics of the environment with
      parameters corresponding to one or other activity depending on the
      person or embedded in the acquired interactions with energy
      fields, that is a kind of bio-energetic approach is needed in the
      planning of the impact of electromagnetic fields on the human body
      and its biological field (bioenergetic environment ).<br>
      <br>
      [0014]<br>
      The method takes into account the organization of optimum
      parameters based on the environment of human influence on its body
      different stimuli any energy nature, including bioenergy effects
      of low intensity. The highest biological activity have
      electromagnetic fields (bio-energy impact), the intensity of which
      varies from 10-2 to 10-16 W / cm2.<br>
      <br>
      [0015]<br>
      The method takes into account the electromagnetic fields that are
      divided into natural, which in turn are divided into external -
      the cosmic, geophysical, biological and internal generated by
      different structural levels of the body, and artificial
      electromagnetic fields that now led to the possible threat of a
      kind of " electromagnetic pollution ".<br>
      <br>
      [0016]<br>
      Preventive effect and improvement of the human body by this method
      ensures the participation of all the biochemical and psychological
      processes, namely, sensation, perception, attention, memory,
      representation, imagination, thought and emotion. And although
      some of these questions do not appear and are found only in
      certain of its population, optimal conditions for disease
      prevention and health improvement in general depend on the
      specific conditions of the formation and flow of each of these
      processes.<br>
      <br>
      [0017]<br>
      Recently developed quite a number of ways to protect and insulate
      people from the impact of external factors and energy field. At
      present known methods of protection against some of the most
      powerful sources of pathogenic effects on humans, leading to the
      destruction of his subtle physical fields with very unpleasant
      consequences for him. These are: 1. Cosmic radiation 2. Geopathic
      Zone 3. Socio-pathogenic effects 4. Technopathogenic radiation
      Today city dwellers are exposed at the same time exposed to all
      these pathological types of radiation.<br>
      <br>
      [0018]<br>
      According to the proposed method of human body - is a balanced
      self-regulating biological system, which is itself in a position
      to get rid of the disease, if you create the conditions that
      correspond to the laws of nature and not contrary to human
      ecology.<br>
      <br>
      [0019]<br>
      Known methods can solve the problem of providing bioenergy
      environment, taking into account only the impact of individual
      factors above. It does not take into account the effect of other
      components of the total energy field and their impact on human and
      biological field together. In addition, the known methods provide
      bioenergy environment in small volumes and, most importantly, do
      not allow you to control the bioenergetic state of the
      environment. Basically they are aimed at reducing the impact of
      harmful effects to the body by counteracting the external
      pathogenic factors when other measures can not reduce their effect
      on the human body.<br>
      <br>
      [0020]<br>
      Summary of a method for providing bioenergetic ecology of the
      present invention is as follows.<br>

      In every part of the earth's surface by cosmic radiation,
      geomagnetic field, geopathic fields. According to the present
      method of providing bioenergy ecology to the building on the
      ground determine the direction of the geographic poles, the
      magnitude and direction of the magnetic field of the Earth, the
      location of the geopathic zones, to lock geopathic zones in the
      proposed construction site, choose a place for the construction of
      the building and its location, placement of partitions inside the
      building , construction and decoration materials, furnishings and
      furniture with the psycho-physiological state of people who will
      live or work in the building. Psycho-physiological state of people
      is determined by finding the integral index of tension by
      measuring respiration rate, heart rate and indicators of galvanic
      skin response, and using dowsing techniques and by analysis of the
      horoscope of birth. Select the aspect ratio of the building, its
      length to width ratio, based on a ratio of 2: 3 to 10:10 meters,
      floor work is carried out taking into account the period of the
      lunar month, on completion using dowsing techniques determine the
      intended use of the premises, on the territory adjacent to the
      building block the effects of geopathic zones by planting them in
      the center of tree species, accumulating the natural energy, or
      backfilling their locations mineral concentrators of energy, such
      as<b> granite rubble or white sand cushion thickness of up to 0.8
        meters</b> and is placed at a location nearby plants and
      landscape items accumulating cosmic energy and provides
      attenuation of the negative effects of the geomagnetic field of
      the building and the space around it.<br>

      Integral estimates of the intensity of human use in the
      differential diagnosis of the functional state of the person, the
      analysis of employment, with therapeutic relaxation and
      esthete-therapeutic effect in the evaluation of
      psycho-physiological tension, to assess stress (see. <b>Patent
        No. 2073484</b>, A 61 N 1/16, 1996). These factors allow the
      evaluation to adequately reflect the functional state in the time
      of the study due to the integration of local indicators of
      functional subsystems into a single assessment. Status of
      psychophysiological tension phylogenetically developed as a
      reaction to the mobilization of functional reserves of the body in
      response to stressful stimuli. This method uses integral estimates
      according to the procedure used in the Institute of Medical and
      Biological Problems.<br>
      <br>
      [0023]<br>
      According to this method among functional systems under the
      influence of stressor are primarily at mobilizing:
      cardio-respiratory system, which provides the energy balance of
      the body and has a number of stable indicators, of which the
      simplest to consider are the duration of the cardiac and
      respiratory cycle. In the known method used reciprocals: heart
      rate (HR) and respiratory rate (BH); eksretornaya sweating system,
      which is an indicator of the state of galvanic skin response
      (GSR). The selected indicators mainly provide a reliable estimate.<br>
      <br>
      [0024]<br>
      As the assessment of the state of the human body can be used
      integrated assessment of tension that characterizes the
      psychophysiological tension, depending on the value of the
      respiratory rate, heart rate and indicators of galvanic skin
      response. For people who are in good psycho-physiological and
      emotional state, the composite indicator is in the range 0.2-0.5.
      The angle of rotation of the building is 5o-23o. In this corner of
      the geomagnetic field reversal partially penetrates into separate
      premises, which allows not to violate the biorhythms of the body
      and maintain the relationship with the environment, while reducing
      the effect of electromagnetic fields on the human body to a safe
      limit (about 1.2 mV / m in the electrical component and 12 uA / M
      in the magnetic component, the oscillation period of from 50 s to
      650 s). For people irritable, with a weakened immune system and
      suffering from diseases of the level of the electromagnetic field
      should be a minimum of the order of 1 mV / m in electrical
      components and 10 uA / M in a magnetic component, the oscillation
      period of 1 to 600, in order to avoid disrupt biological rhythms
      of the body and the biochemical processes occurring in the normal
      state. The angle of rotation of the building in this case is
      24-43o.<br>
      <br>
      [0025]<br>
      For people who are calm and balanced, to improve their health,
      increase immunity is necessary to increase the level of
      penetration of the electromagnetic field and cosmic radiation in
      the building in a range not exceeding the required level of
      security.<br>
      <br>
      [0026]<br>
      Table. 1 shows the relationship between the levels of
      psycho-physiological state of people and levels of electromagnetic
      radiation to determine the internal layout of the building
      received an experimental way.<br>
      <br>
      [0027]<br>
      Premises indicators which exceed the level of the electromagnetic
      field in the table are not intended for long-term stay in them as
      people, and can be used for household purposes: as a utility room,
      storage rooms, toilets, etc.<br>
      <br>
      [0028]<br>
      Considering that the integral estimates of tension residing in the
      house of people over time may change under the influence of
      various factors, using them to achieve the goals set in the
      present invention, only roughly to determine the position of a
      building under construction. More consistent results are obtained
      when applying to assess the psycho-physiological state of human
      bioenergetic characteristics, obtained by a known method using
      dowsing pendulums framework or conventional design.<br>
      <br>
      [0029]<br>
      Table. 2 shows exemplary values of rotation angles frames
      corresponding to different levels of psycho-physiological state of
      people and the corners of the building with respect to the azimuth
      rotation, depending on the derived parameters obtained an
      experimental way.<br>

      The most permanent in its effect voltage parameters of mental and
      emotional energy fields and human, almost independent of external
      stress conditions, can be considered a predisposition of the body
      and its systems to specific reactions to external stressors, which
      is calculated on the basis of a person's birth astrological chart
      (horoscope) with using known techniques. The planets of the solar
      system projecting its power and influence of electromagnetic
      radiation in the range of ultra-low on the surface of the earth
      and living organisms. Resulting in the birth of human influence of
      planets and distant stars, considered in astrology, exert their
      effect on the state of the human body, its characteristics and
      bio-energy for life processes in general, at all stages of the
      life cycle. Temporal changes in the characteristics of human
      bio-field superimposed on the influence obtained at birth, and
      thus lead to certain changes in a psychophysiological state, which
      can be calculated from the analysis of a person's birth
      astrological chart (horoscope). This way you can determine the
      adaptive capacity of human rights in general and to properly
      assess the ability of the organism to protect against
      environmental influences the field and calculate the direction in
      azimuth, which allows a person to restore the integrity of the
      field after OPRRNA of negative energy factors.<br>

      Table. 3 shows the relationship indicators horoscope birthday
      person with a total strength of the electromagnetic field and the
      corresponding angles of these states turn a building under
      construction in the azimuthal projection obtained an experimental
      way.<br>
      <br>
      [0032]<br>
      Matched from the astrological point of view, the position of the
      structure, finishes, colors and furnishings attracted favorable
      influence of the planets and other astrological factors considered
      necessary for the body proportions, thus providing a person a
      unique revitalizing effect.<br>

      Construction of a new facility or reconstruction of old most
      effectively carried out subject to certain phases of the moon,
      which has a significant impact on the flow of energy and physical
      processes in the world in general and in the human body and his
      mental health in particular. Despite the fact that the influence
      of the moon - only part of the total energy of cosmic influences
      of nature, the high importance of this influence is
      self-explanatory and evidence. The moon causes the tides of the
      oceans, makes the crust to rise. The moon affects the entire mass
      of plasma in the body and nervous activity. An even more
      pronounced effect it has on the energy potential of man. So,
      during the full moon intensity of weak electromagnetic fields of
      man becomes the most visible, and therefore exerted on him
      bioenergetic impact should wear calming nature. During the new
      moon of the field characteristics of the aura appreciably reduced
      and the field strength falls - it is necessary to hold a tonic
      effect on the body to increase vitality and strengthen the
      adaptive capacity of the individual. This impacts on biological
      human energy field on the first day of the lunar month should be
      minimal, gradually accruing in the next few days before the full
      moon. Then, the impact should be proportional to the decrease,
      reaching a minimum at the end of the lunar month, on the border of
      the next new moon.<br>
      <br>
      [0034]<br>
      Thus, the period of the lunar month, lasting about 29.5 solar
      days, can be divided into several periods, the carrier independent
      power characteristics. In this regard, the construction works are
      also divided into several stages, depending on the characteristics
      of the lunar energy influences on the surface of our planet and
      flowing individual or mass energy interactions. Getting
      construction determine specific lunar day and the value of the
      electromagnetic field on that day in a given area development. In
      carrying out operations to ensure bioenergy ecology, see to it
      that the true value of the electromagnetic field is between the
      value corresponding to the period of the new moon, and the value
      attributable to the middle of the lunar month. The minimum value
      corresponds to the minimum acceptable in terms of maintaining the
      body's normal biorhythmic action and the magnitude of the
      electromagnetic field in the middle of the lunar month should not
      exceed the maximum value allowed for the proper operation of the
      organs and body systems. In this case, according to the present
      invention, there is no violation of the effect of the monthly
      lunar rhythms on human biological field and the values ??of the
      electromagnetic field levels are within safe limits.<br>
      <br>
      [0035]<br>
      Based on the above calculation of the building at the time it is
      advisable to carry out the following: the markup in the nature
      house plan and device obnosok, assistive devices for excavation
      produce favorable lunar days before the full moon; excavation and
      installation of foundations, as well as the construction of the
      underground part of the future structure (basements, cellars,
      underground garages, etc.) produced in the second half of the
      lunar month. By the second half of the lunar month is also
      desirable to tie the end of any stage of construction works,
      followed by a change of technology should be further work (for
      example, complete the construction of walls and floors, complete
      interior finishing, etc.); the beginning of the construction and
      erection of walls necessarily tied to the first half of the lunar
      month, it is advisable to start this work in the first quarter of
      the moon; at crucial for its energy and electromagnetic
      characteristics of the lunar days (9, 15, 23, 29 days of the lunar
      calendar) it is better not to produce serious works and restrict
      the removal of defects, removal of debris, etc. types of work.<br>
      <br>
      [0036]<br>
      The geometrical dimensions of the building has a direct effect on
      the bioenergy situation in the building by setting a certain
      direction of the electromagnetic field, resulting in the
      appearance of stable energy flows inside the building, the
      formation of so-called "energy draft" that affect energy
      facilities and are in them. Chronic exposure to energy in one
      direction relative to the geomagnetic field and the interior
      adversely affect the stability of the energy field of biological
      objects, and can lead to poor health of man, lower body defenses
      and therefore disrupt bioenergetic environmental conditions
      created in the building. Table. 4 shows the experimentally
      obtained by dowsing based distribution of the energy potential of
      existing fields on the geometry of the building (the ratio of the
      transverse dimension of the building to its length).<br>
      <br>
      [0037]<br>
      Abbreviations: TO - the long axis of the building, emergency - a
      circle clockwise PSP - a circle counterclockwise.<br>
      <br>
      [0038]<br>
      The table above shows that the best relationships, provides the
      most favorable bioenergy effects on people inside the building are
      the following aspect ratio: 8:10, 7:10, 5: 6, 5: 8, 9:10, 8: 8 m .<br>
      <br>
      [0039]<br>
      Pick up the building materials to be used in the construction of a
      residential building on the principle of maximum protection of the
      interior space of the building against the penetration of harmful
      electromagnetic radiation. As a building material using
      conventional materials used in civil construction: brick, wood,
      sand, etc. with regard to their interaction with electromagnetic
      fields.<br>
      <br>
      [0040]<br>
      Then calculated the position of the internal walls of the building
      and determine the layout of the building storey levels, guided by
      the psycho-physiological and emotional state of the people, the
      level of electromagnetic fields and the time of finding the people
      in these areas.<br>
      <br>
      [0041]<br>
      After determining the layout inside the building shall assess the
      decoration of the building inside and out in terms of the possible
      protective effect of finishing materials. The exterior may be
      faced with mineral and wood products, bioactive materials (for
      example, with the addition of hard rubber) and others. Natural
      materials, by allowing accumulation of cosmic energy to create a
      field, opposing destructive external fields. Interior decoration
      of the building is carried out on the basis of calculating the
      parameters of the mutual influence of the materials used on the
      human body and its subtle energy components. Due to the decision
      and the careful selection of materials for every room in terms of
      its purpose, energy and electromagnetic fields inside the building
      are aligned to the optimal settings for living people. At the same
      time there is an alignment of their own human energy field with
      the subsequent optimization of psycho-physiological status.
      Indoors strength of the constant electric field is zero, and
      useful to the body low-frequency pulsations of the geomagnetic
      field from 1 to 600 to achieve a sufficiently low level of
      radiation, providing a positive effect on the human body. It
      should be noted that this method provides individual furnish
      Improvement both outside and inside for efficiency improvement of
      the person. To do this in separate rooms can be used for finishing
      various tree species with a favorable living for the
      electromagnetic potential (birch, oak, pine, lime, apple, etc.).
      The tree has a protective effect on the flow of harmful energies
      that permeate the room. On the other hand, it serves as a source
      of favorable energy by accumulating it from outer space.
      Therefore, by way of furniture for the rooms is individually made
      of natural wood and is in the form of an additional barrier to the
      direction of the geomagnetic field of the Earth. The interior
      requires the use of natural minerals as accumulators of cosmic
      radiation favorable range.<br>
      <br>
      [0042]<br>
      Given the significance of the cosmic radiation of a particular
      type on the formation of electromagnetic fields inside and outside
      the building, in this way highlights the most important for the
      functioning of the body radiation spectra corresponding to the
      planets of the solar system. Each planet in the solar system has a
      predominant influence on the nature of its own mineral and
      vegetable kingdoms, respectively, on the organs and systems of the
      human body, which also serve as the basis for mineral and
      vegetable elements. Matched cosmobiological laws minerals and
      materials coming into contact with the body, attracts beneficial
      influence of the planets in the required proportion to the body,
      thus exerting a person a unique revitalizing effect.<br>

      It is desirable that the windows were located on the south or east
      side. Location mirrors also chosen in a special way to the mirror
      surface to an even distribution of energy in the room, focusing it
      in a given direction and in any case was not conducive to the
      formation of "energy corridor" that could become a conduit for
      hard negative electromagnetic radiation in the room, breaking the
      outer protection of the premises.<br>

      With a cloth or other. Materials is desirable to create a classic
      color rainbow where each color brings its own frequency of
      vibration and resonates with certain organs and systems of the
      human body, creating conditions for disease prevention and healing
      of the human body. Visual rhythm perceived visually is embodied in
      a linear space and in a plane through a uniform alternation of
      certain forms and their relationship to different optical
      phenomena. Rhythm, which is realized on a plane can be represented
      as a combination of colors and repetition, in the dynamics of
      their relationship and transitions. Linear thrust rhythm
      manifested in painting, drawing, etc. By selecting certain
      combinations of color and rhythmic palette of graphic elements
      created electromagnetic background directing body for internal
      recovery, purification of toxins and negative energy. The method
      of this invention determines the correct orientation relative to
      the magnetic field lines and cosmic radiation interior furniture.
      Energy fields interior items, furniture should have expressed
      energoblokiruyuschimi properties against the negative components
      of the electromagnetic field. Placing certain types of plants
      should create a favorable background for recovery of energy lost
      per day by the body forces and quickly restore normal energy
      structure of the human biofield. Placing species with well-defined
      location possible in order to use their energy potential to create
      a favorable health situation of bioenergy.<br>

      [0048]<br>
      Currently, the mechanisms of influence on the bioenergy situation
      around individual human factors considered are well known and well
      documented. However, an integrated management and the impact of
      this exposure with sufficient efficacy is lacking. No
      comprehensive approach in the application of these methods in
      civil and industrial construction, planning, redevelopment and
      major repairs of buildings. Therefore, the novelty of the proposed
      method differs from previously known. The high efficiency of the
      method is achieved by the following actions, which characterize

          CONDITION</b><br>

      <b> </b><br>
      FIELD: psychotherapy. SUBSTANCE: preliminarily, correlation
      between symptoms of disease and psychotramatic situation as well
      as situations provoking live positive emotions in patient are
      revealed. Patient is then brought into trance state with
      psychological stress features, which are further strengthened. At
      that time, healer places the palm of working hand in the region of
      seventh chakra (at the top of scull) and performs passes
      suggesting disappearance of negative emotions and associated signs
      of disease resulting from removal of negative energy. Once
      emotional state of patient normalized, healer brings him(her)self
      into autogenous immersion state, concentrates him(her)self on
      information useful for patient, and positions palm of working hand
      at distance 10-15 cm from projection of seventh chakra with
      fingers directed to its center. For 3.5-4.5 min, healer stays in
      the same position sending mentally commands oriented to improve
      organism functions. Then, for further 4-5 min, healer repeats the
      same information aloud suggesting trust in positive effect of
      healing. Finally, healer calls up situations and sensations
      associated with live positive emotions in the memory of patient
      suggesting their connection with improvement of total state.
      EFFECT: achieved psychosomatic correction of patient's state.<br>
      <br>
      [0001]<br>
      The invention relates to medicine, in particular psychotherapy
      bioenergetic influence on the human body and can be used for the
      correction of his psychosomatic condition. Communication mental
      and physical processes in the body now has no one in doubt. Peptic
      ulcer and duodenal ulcer, ischemic heart disease,
      neuro-circulatory dystonia, hypertension, metabolic diseases, and
      many other human diseases occur against a background of failure of
      compensatory-adaptive reactions of the organism, which certainly
      involved, and mental processes. It is well known administration of
      psychotropic drugs in treatment of such large.<br>
      <br>
      [0002]<br>
      Widespread current methods of human exposure, aimed at correcting
      the disturbed functions of the organism and representing
      essentially unspecific general effect on the body as a whole. In
      these methods, the most important component is the psychotherapy
      and autogenic training (RF Patent N 2-31665, cl. A 61 M 21 / GS,
      1963, H. Aliyev key to him. MM: The Young Guard, 1990). At the
      same time, autogenous training, in turn, requires the cost of
      mental effort and time a patient defined his attitude to this
      method of treatment that is not available to all.<br>
      <br>
      [0003]<br>
      Widespread in our country and abroad have been the methods of
      so-called "alternative medicine", which is an important component
      of bioenergy effects on man (YM Levinson et al. Basics
      bioenergetic diagnosis and treatment. M., 1991).<br>
      <br>
      [0004]<br>
      Theoretical and practical studies in biophysics, Biocybernetics
      genetics showed that vital functions of any biological system,
      including human is accompanied by weak electromagnetic radiation
      in a wide range of wavelengths, which are the source of cells,
      tissues, organs, systems or whole organism (Biophysics 1989 m. 34,
      N 2, p. 339-348), the bulk of information between all levels of
      biological objects is transmitted by means of electromagnetic
      oscillations ultra low intensity.<br>
      <br>
      [0005]<br>
      Obviously, functional and organic pathological state of tissues or
      organs to modify the characteristics of these radiations.<br>
      <br>
      [0006]<br>
      The method is based bioenergy effects closely linked to human
      mental activity, it puts the specified known fact, and the task of
      the healer is to eliminate the energy imbalance in the body of the
      patient and remove the abnormal high-frequency oscillations. At
      the same time when any contact with the patient's healer there are
      always elements of psychotherapy, which is due to an inherent
      presence of many purely psychological nuances. It enhances the
      effect of the actual impact of bioenergy, so the art of healing
      can not be divided into purely psychic and psychotherapeutic
      purely, as they are closely interrelated and are in fact common
      roots, namely the impact of one person to another through the
      transfer of certain information. The author believes that the
      basis of psychotherapy is also bio-energy program is embedded in
      the floor and the mental image that is embedded in the patient's
      bioenergy.<br>
      <br>
      [0007]<br>
      Biophysical research abilities healers revealed dependence of the
      effect on the state of the impact of bio-energy systems: the
      chakras and acupuncture points, while the measurement of
      electromagnetic radiation in the areas corresponding to the
      projections of the chakras, revealed high levels of
      electromagnetic activity in these areas and the real possibility
      of them psychic energy and its further transformation in various
      kinds of fields and energy, as well as its further communication
      with bioelectric processes in the body and the nervous system.
      (Dubrov A. Theoretical basis, AURA - Z, Vol. 2, N W-1U, 1996).<br>
      <br>
      [0008]<br>
      The closest analogue of the invention is a method for the combined
      effects of a person to improve his psychosomatic condition, which
      includes elements of psychotherapy and bioenergy correction
      described in the book of J. Levinson and Levinson M. Healing. Ways
      and possibilities. - M .: Avery, 1993, p. 158-171, 231-243.<br>
      <br>
      [0009]<br>
      The most important stage of work with the patient in the known
      method is to receive both rational and hypnotic psychotherapy, the
      ability of the healer go into a state of autologous immersion and
      maximum effort of will, accompanied by internal stress and certain
      mental images provide targeted, including bio-energy impact on the
      patient.<br>
      <br>
      [0010]<br>
      The book describes the technique of biopower influence, which the
      authors believe is universal enough, called the combined effects
      of individual techniques targeting the associative links by
      simulating a healer at the very strong negative emotional arousal
      inherent conflict in the patient.<br>
      <br>
      [0011]<br>
      The author's experience in working with patients known to be
      formed before the appearance of references and has the features
      and approaches. Results of this work indicate the possibility of
      exposure of training methodology. At the same time, the degree of
      therapeutic effect depends largely on the state of bio-energy
      healer and the ability to manage power flows.<br>
      <br>
      [0012]<br>
      Method effects on the psychosomatic condition of the person
      comprises administering to a patient in a state
      autogeterosuggestivnogo dive identify stressful situations,
      psychotherapy and bioenergy effects on the psycho-emotional
      sphere, targeting the associative links.<br>
      <br>
      [0013]<br>
      Difference method is that the session is performed in three
      stages. During the first stage the relationship of symptoms with
      the traumatic situation, as well as the situation causing the
      patient bright positive emotions. In the second stage, introducing
      a patient into a state of trance, causing him psychological stress
      condition, reinforcing its unpleasant tactile, or auditory or
      visual stimuli. The healer, having a hand working hand in the
      seventh chakra of the patient and making circular passes
      counterclockwise inspire the disappearance of negative emotions
      and related manifestations of the disease due to the removal of
      negative energy. By normalizing the emotional state of the
      patient's physician introduces himself in the state of autologous
      immersion, focuses on information useful to the patient, a hand on
      the palm of the working distance of 10-15 cm from the projection
      of the seventh chakra fingers towards its center and within 3.5-4,
      5 min remains in this position, mentally sending orders to improve
      the functions of the body. Then, without changing the position of
      your hands for 4-5 minutes, repeating aloud the same information,
      it inspires faith in the positive effect of the impact, and calls
      to mind the patient's situation and feelings associated with
      bright positive emotions, suggesting their association with the
      improvement of the general condition.<br>
      <br>
      [0014]<br>
      The proposed method is as follows.<br>
      <br>
      [0015]<br>
      At the preparatory stage, the healer performs the dual nature of
      the program. During confidential conversation with the patient in
      each case, the healer tries to reveal himself to his individual
      peculiarities. In particular, on the one hand notes and highlights
      those that relate to specific situations or things that cause a
      patient in a life of strongest feelings of fear, anxiety or fear
      of something that will continue to be a healer used as leverage to
      create desperately tense psychological (stressful) situations. On
      the other hand allocated to the other part of himself situations
      and moments associated with extremely positive emotions of the
      patient, ie, the individual program used by the healer with
      further exposure.<br>
      <br>
      [0016]<br>
      Using known techniques, the patient is administered a state
      autogeterosuggestivnogo dive, during which it is advisable to
      convince him of the possibilities of bioenergy healer
      demonstrating Kirlian effect or other effects - bioenergetic
      healer fingerprints on the screen, heat or other sensations. All
      this sets the patient in a certain way, strengthening his faith in
      healing. Next, the patient psychological stress conditions are
      simulated using previously obtained medical history, reinforcing
      his pronunciation of individually selected formula suggestion, all
      sorts of unpleasant tactile, acoustic or auditory stimuli. This
      could be splashing in the face of a patient with cold water, or
      the sudden jerky sound, very loud sound, or a demonstration of the
      fragment pattern generating patient visually horrifying
      impression.<br>
      <br>
      [0017]<br>
      The variant in which a complex effect on auditory, visual, and
      other analyzers, which allows to achieve the maximum stress for
      the patient situation, providing aggravation of the negative
      effect and cause a state of maximum emotional energy and
      excitement, in fact revealing the defect energy balance.<br>
      <br>
      [0018]<br>
      Healer, while providing some protection techniques, working hand
      in a circular motion produces passes counterclockwise on the
      seventh chakra of the patient (sahasrara) at the same time
      pronounces the prepared formula suggestion about improving the
      state due to the removal of negative energy. As soon as the
      patient's emotional state is normalized, the healer goes to the
      next stage of exposure. By introducing themselves into a state of
      autologous immersion and focus on information that is useful to
      the individual patient, the healer has a working palm of the hand
      at a distance of 10-15 cm from the projection of the 7th chakra in
      the patient's head with your fingers in the direction toward the
      center and within 3.5 4.5 min remains in this position, mentally
      sending orders to improve a particular organ or function of the
      body as a whole. Then, without changing the position of the hands
      healer for 4-5 minutes, repeat aloud the same information,
      inspiring confidence in a mandatory patient positive effect of the
      whole. Healer after the session goes out of their own autologous
      immersion and any known methods displays the patient from a state
      of trance.<br>
      <br>
      [0019]<br>
      The above-described method, the steps of representing a session to
      the patient in a specific sequence, a new combined effect on the
      psychosomatic condition of the patient.<br>
      <br>
      [0020]<br>
      Example 1. Patient S. 22. The diagnosis: paranoid, continuously
      progressive schizophrenia, delusional type. Sick for 5 years. The
      patient noted compulsive phenomena delusions, isolation.
      Subsequently, the clinical picture was dominated by a
      paranoid-hallucinatory syndrome with delusional disorder.
      Provoking moment was rape. Repeatedly treated permanently with
      psychotropic drugs (stelazin to 30 mg daily, haloperidol 15 mg per
      day), insulin - 10 courses. There was in remission for up to 2-3
      months. After 6 sessions of treatment by the method of PG Nikitin
      - remission of up to 3 years.<br>
      <br>
      [0021]<br>
      Example 2. Patient B. 45 years. For 16 years, suffering from
      duodenal ulcer chronic relapsing course of the disease with acute
      exacerbation of 2-3 times a year. Before the start of the session
      complained of pain in the epigastric region, occurring at night on
      an empty stomach, heartburn, unstable stool, weight loss. In a
      study of changes in blood and urine were found. Fecal occult blood
      test - negative. At esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed chronic
      gastritis, peptic ulcer defect measuring 0.5 cm in diameter in the
      area of ??small curvature duodenal ulcer, chronic duodenitis,
      moderately severe scar deformation of the duodenal bulb.
      Outpatient basic therapy, including diet (Table 1 N), antacids,
      anticholinergic agents, vitamin (B1, B6) in a day, sedatives
      without apparent feeling better.<br>
      <br>
      [0022]<br>
      After 10 sessions the re-examination of ulcerative defect healed,

      electromagnetic fields of different origin. Device has screen in
      the form of grid made of "golden twist" and transmitting antenna.
      To remove "Faraday cage" effect, antenna is positioned between
      screen and man's body. Electromagnetic oscillations of extra-low
      intensity excited in antenna circuit by means of generator of

      <br>
      <b>DESCRIPTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0001]<br>
      The invention relates to the field of medical equipment, namely to
      electromagnetic therapy and may be used for the active protection
      of bioenergy weak electromagnetic fields of different origin.<br>
      <br>
      [0002]<br>
      This device is a logical continuation of the work in the field of
      low-frequency relaxation therapy (NRT), based on the effects of
      short electrical pulses (0.1 ms to 100 ms) with a current of 0.1
      mA to 100 mA through the electrodes of different shapes on
      biologically active points ( BAP) of the human body or
      biologically active zones of the human body (BAZ). In most cases,
      BAT coincide with the classical acupuncture points (acupuncture)
      various schools of traditional oriental medicine.<br>
      <br>
      [0003]<br>
      Known low-frequency relaxation therapy method of Dr. R. Voll [1],
      [2], which is the most tested in practice, contraindications are
      well understood and justified, a bibliography has dozens of names.<br>
      <br>
      [0004]<br>
      Structurally, the apparatus for implementing HPT presented and
      formed as a small-sized device, the power supply through the
      regulator connected to the generator of electric pulses in the
      frequency range from 0.2 to 10 Hz, with control of frequency and
      amplitude control device and displaying the pulse repetition
      frequency on the display, the output generator via a matching
      device (usually up transformer) connected to the electrodes.<br>
      <br>
      [0005]<br>
      Electronic control the frequency and amplitude of pulses during
      the NRT allows stimulating effect on the BAP and BAZ of skin.<br>
      <br>
      [0006]<br>
      The disadvantage of NRT is a contact exposure through the skin
      into the BAP and BAZ, exposure to only one meridian or the
      so-called "quadrant" through electrodes.<br>
      <br>
      [0007]<br>
      A device for electromagnetic protection - shielding metal grille
      (net) [3], [4]. The screens are performed for multilayer circuit
      itself (on its surface in the form of eddy currents)
      electromagnetic fields of different frequencies. Thus,
      low-frequency, up to 1000 Hz field shield steel screen tens or
      hundreds of kilohertz - permalloy, microwave - fine copper mesh
      coated with gold and silver. For strong fields in the heat
      shielding is important only for the weak - low resistance of the
      surface layer, the absence of oxide on the surface, or grid cells
      do not form a loop in which there is self-induction EMF with
      electromagnetic flow compensating shielded electromagnetic field.<br>
      <br>
      [0008]<br>
      Long-term studies of people working inside the shielded room,
      drivers, conductors, drivers and so on. N. Have shown that
      screening reduces efficiency, depresses and weakens the body.<br>
      <br>
      [0009]<br>
      With the advent of millions of personal computers was a question
      of protection from radiation computer (strong electromagnetic
      fields from 50 Hz to 40 kHz, a weak X-rays, magnetic field
      deflecting systems and display field in the tens of megahertz from
      the processing unit). The use of protective clothing with stitched
      metal grids showed that screening has the effect of "Faraday
      cage", ie that apart from "harmful" radiation escaped and "useful"
      bio-energy radiation, when the living entity in the screen gets
      all the necessities of life, in addition to electromagnetic field,
      and dies.<br>
      <br>
      [0010]<br>
      The technical result obtained by the implementation of the
      invention is to protect the organism from weak electromagnetic and
      bioenergetic technical fields replacing them with weak
      electromagnetic field audio frequency modulated low frequency
      selected by the method of Dr. R. Voll contactless influence on the
      organism as a whole.<br>
      <br>
      [0011]<br>
      This technical result is achieved due to the fact that the device
      is designed as a two-layer-covered apron covering the biologically
      active zones of the human body (chakras), and the upper layer
      shield enclosing mesh material (alloy) "Golden kruchenka." "Gold
      kruchenka" has a small thickness (0.09 mm), high strength (can be
      sewn on the sewing machine), flexibility, resistance to oxidation
      (not tarnish decades, gives a film on the surface and thus screens
      the field Superweak). "Gold kruchenka" traditionally used in
      religious garb during the sacrament of confession (protection
      biopathogenic fields professed). To eliminate the effect of
      "Faraday cage" of the second layer is in the form of fabric sewn
      on the antenna of a copper wire in a spiral shape with a pitch of
      10 mm to obtain a uniform electromagnetic field, for simultaneous
      exposure via bases on the whole body. The antenna via a matching
      device (the transformer) connected to the tone generator
      configured such that the shape of the pulses in the antenna close
      to the delta-function (narrow pulse of large amplitude having at
      expansion in Fourier series of infinite spectrum), wherein the
      signal generator is modulated by low frequency pulses . The
      modulation frequency is selected by the method of Dr. R. Voll and
      is equal to 10 Hz.<br>

      [0001]<br>
      The invention relates to medicine, namely to psychoneurology.<br>
      <br>
      [0002]<br>
      We know the impact of bio-energy one person to another through a
      variety of psychic techniques and hypnosis.<br>
      <br>
      [0003]<br>
      However, these methods can not locate the object concentrated
      exposure to the brain, and thus, most of the bioenergy doctor does
      not reach the pathological centers in the brain of the patient.<br>
      <br>
      [0004]<br>
      It is also known from elementary physics that, if a generator of
      electromagnetic waves of any frequency (in this case, such a
      generator is the human brain) to install metallic conductor in a
      spiral or grid, then the conductor will induce electromagnetic
      oscillations. On this basis found that the room of the head of an
      animal (a monkey) in a cylindrical metal cavity, powered by a
      generator, has a strong effect on the brain of the animal, up to
      cardiac arrest and respiratory activity (Boldwin M. Bach SA Lewis
      SA Effects of radio-frequency energy on primate cerebral activity.
      Neurology, 1960, 10, 2, 178).<br>
      <br>
      [0005]<br>
      Similar studies on the effects of different electromagnetic
      oscillations in the brain of animals held Yu.A.Holodov (The
      reactions of the nervous system to electromagnetic fields. M.
      1975).<br>
      <br>
      [0006]<br>
      The aim of the invention is to increase the impact of bioenergy
      local doctor on the brain of the patient for therapeutic purposes.<br>
      <br>
      [0007]<br>
      The purpose is achieved thanks to a special helmet of the
      bioenergy metal plates. Such helmets, apparatus for other purposes
      known. Zernov stereotactic apparatus having a circular base and a
      hemispherical ribs, giving the whole structure view of the helmet
      and is designed to determine the spatial position of the
      structures of the brain (IM Irger Neurosurgery, M. 1971).<br>
      <br>
      [0008]<br>
      The drawing shows a helmet proposed, made of thin plates.<br>
      <br>
      <div align="center"><img alt="" src="ru2100008a.jpg" height="421"
          width="639"><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      [0009]<br>
      The helmet consists of a base plate 1, connected mobile lock 2,
      regulating the basic plate of the size of the patient's head.
      Plate width 13 mm, length 580 mm. Along the perimeter of the plate
      there are eight plates attached 3 10x10 mm with slots 4 and 5
      slots arranged through the 58 mm, which is necessary for even
      distribution of bioenergy on the brain.<br>
      <br>
      [0010]<br>
      In each of the slits 4 plates 3 are inserted thin plate 6
      hemispherical width 6 mm, thickness 0.3 mm, length 330 mm. The
      basal plate 1, folded wrap, cover mobile lock 2. Plate 6 is bent
      and fixed to the two ends of the slots 4, because of this they
      form a semicircle. In riveted plates 3 and in the middle of the
      plates 6 are hemispherical socket 5 with a diameter of 3 mm thread
      for screwing the needle electrodes 7 and a length of 130 mm, a
      thickness of 1 mm with a thread at the base.<br>
      <br>
      [0011]<br>
      Putting on the helmet on the head of the patient provides the
      adaptation of the brain from the environment and increases the
      patient's perception of bioenergy doctor.<br>
      <br>
      [0012]<br>
      Method of use of the helmet.<br>
      <br>
      [0013]<br>
      After donning a helmet on the head physician of the patient begins
      to search for "target", that is, the alleged pathological focus.
      This manipulation is carried out as follows. The doctor takes two
      fingers at the base of the needle electrode needle and injected it
      into the slot 5 of the attached plate 3 starts twisting movements
      of the fingers in sequence around the perimeter of the base plate
      1 to find the zone the pathological focus - "target." At the time
      of entering the patient feels boring traffic light at this point,
      and considerable relief, which gives reason to believe that the
      "target" is found. Thereafter, the electrode is screwed into the
      socket 5 attached plate 3 projected above the target. Thus, over
      the pathological area, if it is expanded, it can have multiple
      electrodes.<br>
      <br>
      [0014]<br>
      After installation of the "target" of needle electrodes doctor
      begins another electrode electrostatically charged electrodes
      placed on the helmet of the patient, thereby inducing its own
      bio-energy into the brain of the patient, thus korregiruya
      pathological focus.<br>
      <br>
      [0015]<br>
      Before the session, the doctor finds out a patient's ability to
      respond to the doctor's aura and positive response directly
      appointed treatment sessions.<br>
      <br>
      [0016]<br>
      Expected scope of clinical application of bioenergy helmet and
      techniques: different stress, suicide attempts and various forms
      of phobias, legonevroz, depression, phantom pain, insomnia,
      diseases of the internal organs of central origin (such as stress
      ulcers of the stomach and duodenum, cardioneurosis).<br>
      <br>
      [0017]<br>
      Proposed helmet used in some patients with different pathologies:
      two children with logoneurosis held for 7 sessions get good
      immediate results; patients with severe asthma attacks, after five
      sessions to get a good clinical effect and mild asthma
      (observation period 1 year); patients in the stress associated
      with the murder of his son. After the session, the patient noted a
      significant improvement in the state have been thinking about
      suicide, there was confidence. The currently running.<br>

        <b>Method for the indentification of frequency and bioenergetic
          activities in waters and their use.</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Process for identifying bioenergetic and biological frequency
      activity properties in waters, especially comprising the phases
      of: placing a small quantity of water to be investigated in a
      container of inert material, transparent to light, projecting
      towards said water a suitable electromagnetic radiation of
      predetermined wavelength, observation by said operator or by
      anyone present of a variation in intensity of the stationary wave
      of the pulsation, the presence of such variation indicating the
      active response to said frequency. c<br>
      <br>
      This invention relates to a method of identifying, in a water, the
      existence of particular frequency properties or bioenergetic and
      biological activities, and to the use of the waters having such
      properties.<br>
      <br>
      For many types of waters, from various sources, there has been
      recognized a particular biological activity or therapeutic
      effectiveness that differs from one type to another of said
      waters, and which therefore makes them recommendable for many
      applications, for example for therapeutic purposes and purposes of
      ecological equilibrium. Such activity cannot normally be
      correlated with the chemical composition of the water and the
      substances present in solution in it, nor with its
      physico-chemical characteristics, and therefore cannot be singled
      out in analytical chemical terms or detected by common physical
      methodologies. The efficacy of such waters, hereinafter termed for
      brevity "active" waters, in relation to particular types of
      pathologies, biological changes or the like, has usually been
      identified solely by empirical means and has been based upon
      tradition or upon prolonged clinical trials and the like.<br>
      <br>
      This did not, however, make it possible to verify directly, on a
      small quantity of water under investigation, of unknown or
      undocumented origin, its possible efficacy or "activity", as it
      frequently was not possible to have recourse to extensive
      experimentation, which would have required long periods of time
      and availability of sufficient quantities of such water.<br>
      <br>
      On the other hand, persons skilled in the art are familiar with
      the fundamental principles of resonance and of microinformation,
      elements of the frequency study that characterizes auricular
      medicine. These principles constitute the basic element of the
      relevant research, in that as a result of them every aspect of
      life is considered in its vibratory reality. The starting point is
      a simple scheme, which attributes a specific frequency to each
      human biological tissue, which leads to the possibility of
      knowledge of and investigation into every vegetable or animal
      biological tissue.<br>
      <br>
      The term "resonance" is to be understood as meaning the physical
      condition which occurs when two waves of equal amplitude and
      length encounter each other. With regard to microinformation, this
      is the technique by which there is supplied, to the frequentially
      modified tissue, the information of the frequency which induces
      the correction, for example by means of the cutaneous receptors.
      Microinformation in reality can be interpreted as a much broader
      mechanism, inherent in nature; it daily demonstrates its
      receptivity to cosmic information, by which moreover it is moulded
      and nourished for the purpose of realizing the biorhythmic
      ciclicity. It is known that frequency is defined as the vibratory
      activity inherent in every element. By physics, such vibratory
      activity proper to each elementary particle is expressed by
      greater and lesser intensity according to whether substances of an
      aerial, liquid or solid nature are considered. Such intensity is
      the resultant of two fundamental parameters: the wavelength and
      wave amplitude. Therefore a solid body, for example, subjected
      more to gravitational force, will have vibratory frequencies that
      are slower than a liquid body, less subject to the same force,
      measureable in Hertz. Frequency investigation into organisms makes
      use, however, of the technique known as VAS, by means of which a
      variation in the stationary sphygmic wave on the radial artery is
      detected each time a changed frequency approaches the ear, and
      therefore the energy field of the organism.<br>
      <br>
      In relation to said possibility, it is necessary to carry out a
      thorough and detailed investigation into the vibratory equilibrium
      of the various organs and tissues which make up the individual, in
      such a way as to detect the energy links which run between the
      various levels, which determine the various passages of the
      conversion of energy into matter. For this purpose, the use of the
      hydrofrequency technique is envisaged, which consists of two
      successive moments:<br>
      <br>
      1) Frequency investigation by means of the resonance test.<br>
      2) Energy re-equilibrium therapy by the use in microinformation of
      the frequencies which can correct the change.<br>
      1) Frequency investigation consists of<br>
      a) positioning the patient in the north-south (head-feet)
      direction,<br>
      b) isolating his energy field from any external interference
      including that of the therapist with 27 drops of Acqua 7FL (or
      definitively active water on all seven frequencies that resonate
      on the fifth level), placed around his energy field,<br>
      c) in bringing towards his energy field, preferably at the height
      of the ear, because this is the organ specialized for receiving
      stimuli, frequencies of varying wavelengths, coloured filters, or
      fabrics, or chemical substances which, by interfering with the
      corresponding ones of the organism under examination, will become
      resonant or dissonant. These two characteristics are linked in the<br>
      d) VAS: automatic vascular signal, which consists in the variation
      in the intensity of the stationary wave which can be detected at
      the height of the medial radial artery.<br>
      e) the frequency investigation, once the organism to be analysed
      has been positioned according to the points described above,
      consists in an energy check-up, according to the following
      clinical procedure.<br>
      I - N-S orientation<br>
      II - frequency isolation<br>
      III - activation of the Chakras with the information of 3 drops of
      "Acqua di luce" with specific resonant frequencies with each
      chakra (or point of meeting of the various energies positioned
      along the axial line of the vertabral column).<br>
      IV - measurement of the level of change in PAO (1-9) and in the
      harmonic (1-9); (where PAO represents the conventional
      abbreviation which associates the energy level of the type of
      water considered with an identifying number: for example, PA05 =
      H20 with the vibratory intensity at the fifth octave of the
      physical one).<br>
      V - measurement of the change in the elements (AG-earth; BF-water;
      CE-air; D-fire (which correspond in the basic scheme to the
      frequencies A = 2.5 Hz, B = 5Hz, C=10Hz, D = 20Hz, E=40Hz, f =
      80Hz);<br>
      VI - measurement of the change in the fundamental energies:
      polarized, electrical, magnetic 44A-58-B25 (indicated respectively
      by the numbers Kodak&lt;R&gt; for identification of coloured
      glasses with the type of frequency: with polarized energy = blue =
      44; with electrical energy = green = 58; with magnetic energy =
      red = B25).<br>
      VII - measurement of the adaptation to the seasons and hours of
      the day (indicated by the respective colours Kodak&lt;R&gt;:
      winter=87=virtually black, h 21-3; spring=59=green3 h 3-9; summer
      = 26 = magenta, h 9-15; autumn = 78 = violet, h 15-21).<br>
      VIII - measurement of the changes in the DNA and RNA and of their
      bases: adenine, citosine, guanine, timine, uracil.<br>
      IX - measurement of the changes in the axes of adaptation:
      epiphysis, hypophysis, hypothalamus, acth, cortisolo, suprarenal
      cortico.<br>
      <br>
      Points numbered 1 to 7 are applicable to every biological organism
      and to the ambient. Points 8 and 9 more specifically concern man.<br>
      <br>
      2) Energy re-equilibrium therapy by means of the resonance test
      and the technique of microinformation consists: for man<br>
      f) positioning, in microinformation, on the skin of the right arm
      (periphery), of the solar plexus and of the forehead (centre), the
      frequencies which must be received for removing the change,<br>
      g) in illuminating with white light (heine lamp) the filters
      placed in microinformation, so as to amplify the frequency
      stimulus conducted by the filter and to make it more suitable for
      reception.<br>
      h) in substituting the action of the microlaser (girl-laser
      apparatus with monochromatic rays used in the school of Glem di
      Lione for frequential investigation and therapy) by filters
      containing waters at various frequencies; these filters, operated
      by the hand of the therapist in rotary movement, describe
      elliptical paths around precise localizations of important energy
      sites of the organism: around the umbilicus, they touch the points
      of the liver, spleen, left kidney, right ovary, which constitute
      the coincident basic rhomboidal quadrilateral of the two energy
      pyramids of earth and water; then around the pharynx they touch
      the corresponding points which form the rhomboidal quadrilateral
      of the coincident base of the two energy pyramids of air and fire.
      The number of these rotations is given by the number of altered
      levels which emerges from the analysis of the patient, and the
      direction of the rotation is opposite to that which has generated
      the pathology. In this way it is desired to give to the solid,
      liquid, aerial and caloric whole which constitutes the living
      organism the information of a balanced conformation, that is to
      say a harmonic between the greater and the lesser, between the
      right-hand and left-hand elements, as it occurs in the elementary
      atomic structures.<br>
      i) in the administration over 28 days (one lunar cycle) of a
      mixture of waters prepared in relation to the requirement emerging
      from the frequential investigation, and therefore containing the
      frequencies necessary for the alteration of the organism. These
      waters, administered daily during the fundamental rhythms of the
      day, lead to the provision of those light frequencies that are
      suitable for catalysing the absorption of the cosmic frequencies.<br>
      <br>
      The requirement therefore arises for providing a method of
      identifying the bioenergetic and biological frequential activity
      or efficacy of the water under investigation, which it shall be
      possible to execute in short times and on small specimens of said
      water, thus making it possible to distinguish "active" waters from
      non-active waters, and which furthermore shall enable different
      characteristics or possibilities of application to be singled out
      between various types of "active" waters.<br>
      <br>
      Said results are achieved by a process for the identification of
      bioenergetic and biological frequential properties in waters,
      according to the present invention, comprising the phases of
      placing a small quantity of water under investigation in a
      container of inert material, transparent to light and preferably
      vitreous, such as a test tube or the like, or even open water, of
      projecting towards said water, from an operator present, a
      coherent electromagnetic radiation of predetermined wavelength
      within the visible range, and of measuring in the medial position
      on the radial artery of the operator and/or of other person
      present, a variation in the intensity of the stationary wave of
      the pulsation, the presence of said variation indicating the
      active response of the water ("activity" of the water at said
      frequency), of repeating the test for several different
      frequencies within the visible or resonant radiation range. The
      variation in intensity of the stationary pulsation wave of the
      subject present at different test frequencies, appropriately
      selected between seven frequencies uniformly spaced apart within
      the visible or resonant range, makes it possible to find out at
      what frequencies said variation occurs, said frequencies being
      characteristic of the water investigated.<br>
      <br>
      An appropriate apparatus for the emission of a suitable radiation
      is composed of a laser beam emitter of very low intensity having
      several selectable frequencies. The presence of the alteration in
      the stationary wave of the pulsation of the operator, in
      correspondence with particular frequencies of the incident
      radiation emitted by the emitter apparatus, can be established on
      waters of known origin and can be placed in relationship with the
      existence of bioenergetic and biological frequential "activities"
      of said waters, already known in advance as a consequence of
      clinical experiments or the like, statistically analysed, or with
      knowledge of another type (so as to extract direct correlation
      data between each type), of water liable to induce alteration in
      the pulsation if it contains particular frequencies that may be
      used for pathologies or biological alterations, thus identifying
      specific fields of application of each.<br>
      <br>
      In contrast, waters that are known to be inert or inactive from
      the point of view of bioenergetic or biological frequency have not
      provided, with any incident wavelength, pulsation alterations. On
      the other hand, waters which have demonstrated the existence of
      alterations in pulsation of the operator, in the test described
      above, at one or more frequencies, have been shown, by subsequent
      clinical experimentation, to be biologically "active" and provided
      with therapeutic properties.<br>
      <br>
      "Active" waters, which have demonstrated a response to seven
      different frequencies uniformly spaced apart in the visible or
      resonant radiation range, can be reproduced by imparting their
      properties to a new mass of water, previously inactive, by the
      method forming the subject of Patent Application number 22.929
      A/88 of the same Patent Proprietor.<br>
      <br>
      More specifically, the present invention relates to a process for
      activating, through a chain of successive dilutions, medicinal
      substances for oral use, dissolved in standard waters with the
      addition of waters having particular properties which have already
      been therapeutically tested. The activated drug has given better
      results from the curative aspect and a reduction in possible
      harmful effects, compared with its traditional administration.<br>
      <br>
      The invention relates also to a process for acitvating, through a
      chain of successive dilutions, extractive solutions of medicinal
      plants in normal water, by means of the additions of "various"
      waters according to the plant, having special properties already
      therapeutically tested. A simple herbal remedy (mallow, mint,
      camomile and others) can take on an increased therapeutic action
      if a specific resonant water is added to it. An infusion of mallow
      plus active water in white light, when subjected to the gold salts
      test, provides active response. The mallow does not absorb the
      frequency of light but strengthens the response thereof in the
      test. (Registered trademark).<br>
      <br>
      Further explanations of the invention are provided by the
      following examples, in which abbreviations of the various waters
      used in the tests are employed.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 1:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      A solution of ZANTAC&lt;R&gt; (a synthetic drug, a tablet of
      ZANTAC&lt;R&gt; 150 in 500 ml of mains water) plus white light
      water is subjected to the gold salts test (Ansaloni A. Vecchi P.,
      publication "Rassegna Chimica" ("Chemical Review") No. 6,
      Nov.-Dec. 1986, page 359) without having an active response, the
      light frequencies are absorbed by the ZANTAC&lt;R&gt;.<br>
      <br>
      An active response is, in contrast, obtained by subjecting to the
      gold salts test a solution of ZANTAC&lt;R&gt; plus a particular
      mixture of waters, water ZANTAC&lt;R&gt; + white light water
      ("Acqua a Luce Bianca") or a mixture of waters of various
      frequencies mixed together to obtain the right-handed resonance to
      the vibrations of the chemically left-handed ZANTAC&lt;R&gt; and
      of a sample of definitely active water having all the seven
      frequencies which resonate in the fifth level. The passage through
      the white light water takes place without loss of frequencies.<br>
      <br>
      The example reported above has demonstrated that only the solution
      containing the tablet of ZANTAC&lt;R&gt; 150 has destroyed the
      activity of the white light water and has interrupted the chain of
      successive activations.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 2:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      40 g of alpine yarrow (also known as achillea millefolium) are
      heated in one litre of water. Before boiling point is reached, the
      heat is extinguished and the vessel covered and allowed to cool.<br>
      <br>
      The liquid is filtered and 48 drops of PA02-AG6-44A are added,
      which represents the right-handed energy formula of the yarrow.
      The infusion is stored in the refrigerator and is warmed each time
      before being drunk. The dose is one-half of a table tumbler, away
      from mealtimes, three times per day. The infusion is used in
      colitis, enterocolitis, cystitis, prostatis, but especially for
      regulating menstrual flow.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 3:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      A mixture is prepared with the following ingredients:<br>
      <br>
      Each evening, a dose of 3-4 teaspoons in 1/4 litres of water is
      taken: this is heated and just before boiling the saucepan is
      removed from the flame and the drops of PAO are added, a funnel is
      fitted as lid and inhalation is commenced and continued for 10
      minutes. Afterwards, the liquid is poured off and one half is
      drunk hot (in the evening) and the other half is drunk in the
      morning on an empty stomach.<br>
      <br>
      Using 46 drops of PAO (Nos. 1-2-3-4) and 18 drops of PA03, a
      soothing effect of the respiratory passages is obtained (in
      rhinitis).<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 4:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The ingredients indicated below are placed in one litre of water:<br>
      <br>
      The liquid is boiled for at least 5 minutes, is poured off and 12
      droplets of water of Nos. 1-2-3-4 are added, in that order. At a
      dose of two cupfuls per day, preferably on an empty stomach, for
      one month, this is used for treating gallstones.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 5:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      In the treatment of epilepsy, two simultaneous reliefs are used,
      prepared as in the following example: Tisane 1 = half a litre of
      water:<br>
      20 g of green sage,<br>
      20 g of green rosemary,<br>
      well washed and chopped fine. This is heated and when it is just
      about to boil the flame is extinguished and there are added:<br>
      3 drops of 7F.L. 9 drops of PA02-CE-58-B25<br>
      3 drops of 7F.MT. or more<br>
      3 drops of 7F.MJ. 9 drops of PA02-CE-44A<br>
      Tisane 2 = one litre of water:<br>
      30 g of oak mistletoe.<br>
      <br>
      The liquid is heated, and the flame extinguished just before it
      boils and then there are added:<br>
      8 drops of 7F.MT4 or 24 drops of PA04-BF2-44A<br>
      the mixture is covered and is allowed to cool and is filtered.<br>
      <br>
      In therapeutic doses suitable for paediatric applications, the
      preparation is used in the treatment of epilepsy in children.<br>
      <br>
      From these example, the importance of the invention is evident for
      its applications for any pathology. In the frequential
      investigation and therapy, the quiet attention of the patient
      enables the remote or near causes of his state of alteration to be
      decoded from his vibratory language. This altered frequency is
      responsible for all the disequilibriums which, from the plane in
      which it shows itself, form in the underlying planes, that is to
      say it is responsible for all the innumerable aspects of pathology
      as far as the chemico- physical aspect.<br>
      <br>
      In the 28 days which follow the re-equilibrium, the taking of
      specific resonant waters catalyses, in the organism, the
      possibility of re-establishing order in the various altered weft
      planes; in fact, the introduction of these active waters
      stimulates, in the organism, the absorption of those correct
      frequencies which the atmosphere daily and cyclically supplies to
      us and which our waters frequently cannot any longer absorb. <br>

        <b> Method for permanent optimisation of bioenergetic states</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      The invention described above relates to a method for reliably
      detecting and eliminating positive or negative bioenergetic rays
      in the human environment and, furthermore, for reliable detection
      and elimination of positive or negative, in particular also of
      positive or negative bioenergetic states of high degree of an
      individual person on the basis of radionic measurement methods by
      using the "Copen Radionic Analytical Computer Mk5", as specified
      in detail in the description of the method. The method according
      to the invention is based partly on the findings which have led to
      the German Patent Application P 4204709.9, and partly on new
      findings as set forth in the present patent description. The aim
      of these measures is to avoid specific states of illness which
      would otherwise possibly or even necessarily occur when the method
      is not used.<br>
      <br>
      Below described procedure relates to the combination of various
      measures for the permanent compliance with the normal values ??of
      bioenergetic states in humans. It is partly based on the findings
      that resulted from 17.02.1992 on the procedure according to German
      patent application P 42 04 709.9.<br>
      <br>
      This method according to German Patent Application P 42 04 709.9
      describes a discontinuous process for the normalization of
      bioenergetic states and is characterized in that. In the 1 Level
      with the "Copen Radionic Analytical Computer Mk 5" or another,
      this comparable Radionic computer of each degree of deviation of
      bioenergetic values ??of the set states in the human or animal
      body, referred to as "over-function" (OF) values ??respectively.
      as "sub-function" (UF) values, is determined numerically, and that
      then by introduction of oppositely polarized, precisely defined
      bioenergetic radiation, for example, the bio-energetic radiation
      from a selected, previously well-defined in terms of its energy
      content Erdstrahlstreifen, these inflated actual values be "zero"
      brought, the exposure time must be determined precisely in
      accordance with the amount of previously established baseline and
      corresponding to the energy content of the bio-energetic radiation
      used by the operator in the body to the setpoint OF = UF =.
      Because of this success is not achieved with a single such measure
      according to experience, this process must be repeated until the
      desired bioenergetic state, characterized by the achievement of
      OF- resp. the UF value of approximately "zero", has set
      permanently. In this German Patent Application P 42 04 709.9 is
      argued that the increased mentioned, especially the greatly
      increased bioenergetic states in the body of the following
      environmental factors are generated:<br>
      <br>
      - Longer linger on negative resp. on positive Erdstrahlzonen of
      exactly determinable intensity, especially during sleep during the
      night or during the hours of sitting on this Erdstrahlzonen during
      the day (eg. school, office etc.<br>
      - Longer stay in the field of in-use electrical equipment, in
      particular incandescent lamps, electric blankets or electric
      drying equipment, mostly negatively polarized energy emit.<br>
      - Prolonged stay in the sun, in the field of high-voltage lines or
      electric railway lines; here is positive proof polarized
      bioenergy. The above information is to be extended according to
      the invention decisively now through the meantime, due to the
      results of further targeted experiments and the thus obtained test
      results and insights from these results.<br>
      Specifically, these are the following results and insights:<br>
      - The existence of the field of "bioenergetic status" in animals
      is far more extensive than that described in the aforementioned
      patent application.<br>
      There in negatively polarized region inventively values ??to UF =
      1248 and according to the invention in the positively polarized
      range values ??to OF = 480 were measured.<br>
      - The impact of the use of electricity in all areas of human life
      is much larger in terms of their bio-energetic effect, as in the
      preparatory work for the Patent Application P 42 04 709.9 was
      determined after the then state of the relevant research.<br>
      - In particular, the effect of illumination with electric bulbs
      and / or fluorescent tubes a significant proportion of the
      quantitative deviations from bioenergetic setpoint.<br>
      - Targeted experiments on the changes in the bio-energetic values
      ??with those respectively in moving motor vehicles. were in
      electrically powered cars, showed that the various transport a
      very crucial roles with respect to their influence on the
      bioenergetic happening when people play.<br>
      - Due to the constantly changing throughout the day influences the
      aforementioned "bio-energetic radiation sources" changing
      analytical values ??were determined continuously at the value
      determination with said Radionic Computer. This ever-changing
      analysis values ??are referred to the clear characterization
      hereinafter referred to as "fluctuating bioenergetic values".<br>
      - The balancing of lying outside their desired state bioenergetic
      states can also (and indeed lighter and labor-saving as this was
      described in the earlier application P 42 04 709.9 with the use of
      earth radiation), according to the invention with the use of
      bio-energetic radiation from certain, because of their shaft
      structure suitable for these purposes and radiesthetically tested,
      fully operational galvanic elements (vulgar: "button cell"), such
      as "Duracell TM alkaline Px 825 / LR 53 1.5 V", alternatively
      respectively in special cases with the bioenergetic radiation of
      electric bulbs , be carried out by electronic light bulbs. These
      results suggest important implications for the process of the
      invention yielded.<br>
      <br>
      To understand the findings and results, which are described below,
      of the finding in the experiments carried out must be presented
      first, after which is going on the human and plant life within
      certain "bioenergetic" limits.<br>
      <br>
      This statement is, however, only really understood when they are
      "bio-energetic" states qualitatively and quantitatively the same
      time "detectable" and especially measurable. It has been 04 709.9
      already mentioned in the said German Patent Application P 42 an
      essential diesbezügicher state factor, namely the "bioenergetic
      normal" (= target state) of healthy human, animal or plant body:
      for the characterization of this state has been there from the
      inventor, the Number indication "+120 BEE" (BEE = bionergetische
      units) suggested. This specification includes both a qualitative
      and a quantitative characterization of this condition. This value
      has been obtained for a variety of experiments, considerations and
      Erkennntnissen that are not the subject of Patent Application P 42
      04 709.9 and also not the patent application described above.
      These findings should be therefore only mentioned here also
      because they are important for the understanding of the inventive
      method.<br>
      <br>
      It was 42 04 709.9 as a result of the carried out special
      experiments theorized in the meantime, since the filing date of
      German Patent Application P that the above-mentioned bio-energetic
      boundaries in relation to the "bioenergetic target state" of "+120
      BEE" apparently at "+180 BEE "on the one hand and" -180 BEE "are
      on the other.<br>
      Outside these "bioenergetic limits" no life is apparently
      possible. Based on this assumption was one of the objectives of
      the work to improve the process described in German Patent
      Application P 42 04 709.9, to determine which characterized by
      apparatus metrics limits the "bioenergetic status" in humans in
      order to arrive at a universal applicability of the method.<br>
      To make this determination the radionic instrument "Copen
      Analytical Computer Mk 5" was selected (8), which had proved their
      worth in the preparatory work for the German Patent Application P
      42 04 709.9 as suitable and proven. <br>
      <br>
      As described in this patent application, the value OP = UF =
      "zero" of this computer the above-mentioned value of "+120 BEE";
      He characterizes the normal state of the human body.<br>
      Option A -- In the case of determining a state value in positively
      polarized field according to the German Patent Application P 42 04
      709.9 has been a top led to the filing date with the Copen
      Radionic computer Mk 5 detected value of OF 29.5 in the
      description of the process. To determine this value with the
      OF-selector had, as described there, two to "10" asked dials the
      actual code prepended resp. be readjusted because until that time
      point from the instruction manual for the computer only mentioned
      Radionic readings until OF = 10 were known. However, it was
      established on the basis of tests carried out subsequently, that
      still may occur far higher positive values, caused by random and
      unconscious excessive impingement of the human body with very
      strong positive "bioenergetic" radiation.<br>
      <br>
      The described hereinafter inventive variant of the method of use
      for the Copen Radionic Computer Mk 5 has made it possible, even
      with this instrument in the human, animal or plant body
      "bioenergetic" at random, excessivem influx of high positive
      radiation, eg. by the irradiation with the full sun, or by long
      staying at a very strong strip of positive Erdstrahlfeldes, or in
      strong positive, of certain forms of application of the
      electricity generated positively polarized radiation fields much
      higher positive values ??as the above-mentioned value of OF 29.5
      metrologically capture computer with said Radionic.<br>
      <br>
      It has been found according to the invention that is obtained
      immediately after stopping the excessiven positive stress in the
      extreme case, a value of "OF = 480" when the selected measurement
      "Copen-rate" for having said Radionic computer to be measured body
      part a special ballast-code for this step, namely "131 226" is
      prefixed and the OF-dial to the "0" remains.<br>
      <br>
      It was according to the invention further found that will leave
      generally after stopping the excessiven load with high positive
      bioenergetic radiation of extreme value of "OF + 480" again,
      whereby the steps given below through, for according to the
      invention given below special ballast Root were developed:<br>
      &nbsp;for the stage OF 480: Additional index 131 226<br>
      for the stage OF 360: Additional index 122 369<br>
      for the stage OF 240: Additional index 301 246<br>
      for the stage OF 180: Additional index 741 369<br>
      for the stage OF 120: Additional index 830 137<br>
      <br>
      The to the subsequent stages: necessary OF 60 OF 30 OF 15
      indicators for the said Radionic computers (as in German Patent
      Application P 42 04 709.9 already described), by series of 6,
      respectively. 3, resp. Get 1 10-dials before (or after) the
      Copen-rate for the body to be measured part. It was further found
      that in general, the above-mentioned high OF values, the very
      strong positive bioenergetic states in the body represent, after
      stopping the positive radiation source again relatively quickly
      disappear (due to radiation from the body outwards) when the
      influence of the highly positive radiation had been relatively
      short and the body against this strain in "normal state" (OF = UF
      = zero) was.<br>
      However, if the influence of the highly positive radiation a long
      time and repeatedly carried out, these "natural normalization" is
      only partially possible: in these cases are then referred to the
      Radionic Computer highly positive persistent states measured on
      any of the aforementioned steps.<br>
      <br>
      Variant B<br>
      <br>
      In the case of determining a bioenergetic status in negatively
      polarized region has been in the description of process 42 04
      709.9 a highest listed according to the German Patent Application
      P until the time of this application with the Copen Radionic
      Computer Mk 5 detected value of "UF 156".<br>
      To determine this value had, as described in the aforementioned
      patent application, respectively 15 prefixed with "10" set the
      dials each Copen rate. to be readjusted, as only readings to UF =
      10 were known to at the time of the instruction manual for the
      said Radionic Computer.<br>
      <br>
      The described hereinafter inventive variant of the method of work
      for the Copen Radionic Computer Mk 5 it was now possible with this
      instrument also according to of excessive loading of the human
      body with high-negative bioenergy radiation (eg. For example, by
      long duration stay on strong negative earth rays - or by prolonged
      and especially by frequently stay at bioenergetic radiation range
      of powered-on, in-service electric light bulbs, and other
      electrical equipment, eg. heaters, or to capture during your stay
      in traveling motor vehicles), also significantly higher UF values
      ??as "UF 156" metrologically with said Radionic Computer. It has
      been found according to the invention that is obtained immediately
      after stopping the excessive impingement in extreme cases, a
      maximum value of "UF 1248" when the time selected for the
      measurement "Copen-rate" for the said with the Copen Radionic
      Analytical computer to be measured body part ( glands, organs,
      systems like) a special ballast-code for this step, namely, is
      "324 924" prefix, followed by the UF-selector is set to the number
      "8".<br>
      <br>
      It was according to the invention further found that is left after
      stopping the excessive applying again with high negative
      bio-energetic radiation of the extreme value of UF in 1248, the
      steps given below will go through, for the present invention have
      been developed that indicated below special ballast Root: for
      Stage UF 1248: ballast code "324 924"<br>
      for stage UF 936: ballast code "211 248"<br>
      for stage UF 624: ballast code "731 237"<br>
      for stage UF 312: ballast code "135 913"<br>
      for stage UF 156: ballast code "376 379"<br>
      <br>
      The indicators required for the subsequent stages UF 156, UF 78,
      UF 39, UF 19.5 be - as already described in the aforementioned
      advance notification - by connecting from 15, respectively. 7,
      resp. 3, resp. Get 1 10-dials before Copen rate for the body to be
      measured part. Then a switch on the last digit of the respective
      UF value on the UF-selector is still required for the realization.
      It was further found that in general, the aforementioned UF values
      ??which represent very strong negative bioenergetic status in the
      body, after stopping the negative radiation source again
      relatively rapidly (due to radiation from the body outwards)
      disappear ("fluctuating bioenergetic state values") if this
      negative resp. high negative radiation was only a short time
      available. Was this action of the negative resp. the high negative
      radiation but longer periods are, these "natural normalization"
      without additional measures is only partially or not at all
      possible: in these cases are then referred to the Radionic
      Computer negative resp. highly negative duration states (=
      persistent bioenergetic values) measured. A major problem in
      determining the bio-energetic states in humans is the precise
      determination of their polarization.<br>
      However, this provision must be absolutely correct with regard to
      the measures that are taken for the adjustment to normal values.<br>
      <br>
      With the above-described novel finding of the true in individual
      cases state value from the OF- set forth above, respectively. the
      UF series is automatically also the determination of each relevant
      polarization, since the scale values ??in UF area clear and
      characteristically different from those in the OF portion. The
      scale values ??in UF area then represent inventively values ??in
      the negative range of bioenergetic states (to the vicinity of the
      aforementioned hypothetical limit of "BEE -180), in the
      alternative case, representing the scale values ??in the OF
      portion inventively values ??in the positive range of bioenergetic
      states (to the vicinity of the aforementioned hypothetical limit
      of "BEE +180").<br>
      <br>
      Postscript: As is apparent from the procedure examples, it is
      likely that in addition to said stages respectively in the UF
      range. the OF-range intermediate values ??resp exactly in the
      middle between two of said UF. OF-levels may exist. If no
      persistent value is found for this reason in the state analysis,
      as would have to be determined whether such an intermediate value
      exists persistent.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Description of the present process</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      The invention described below has the goal from 17/02/1992 to
      improve the method according to German Patent Application P 42 04
      709.9 critical to ensure that the progress achieved after the
      successful completion of this process normalization of
      bioenergetic state values ??in each individual case remains
      permanently at this level.<br>
      According to this objective, the invention provides the
      possibility that even highly negative resp. highly positive
      bioenergetic states are reliably detected in animals, thus only
      fully meet the necessary measures to eliminate them (= equivalent
      to the normalization of their bioenergetic states) may be taken.<br>
      The invention further has the goal that the relevant environmental
      conditions in individual cases with a view to largely permanent
      consistency of the thus obtained ideal bioenergetic state values
      ??are designed in accordance with the circumstances largely
      optimal. In accordance with this objective, the inventive method
      consists of three steps, namely:<br>
      Level 1 -- Implementation of inventive measures to substantially
      reduce certain environmental impacts, which would make the success
      of the below performed at Level 2 and 3 measures canceled out if
      they would continue to exist. As has already been pointed out, are
      negative resp. positive bioenergetic factors in the current
      environment of the people, especially that created by the various
      types of applications of electricity and the motorized road, rail
      and air transport bioenergetic radiation hitherto remained
      undetected. The detectable in these cases negative, respectively.
      positively polarized bioenergetic "accompanying radiation" is the
      main reason for the fact that with the inventive method currently
      widely highly negative, but also highly positive bioenergetic
      states are found in humans (in addition to the existing has always
      been "earth radiation"). This highly negative (resp. High
      positive) bioenergetic duration states lead over time to
      malfunctions of various glands, organs and other body parts and as
      a result the formation of certain diseases. Of particular
      importance here is the state of the immune system.<br>
      <br>
      As according to the invention was determined, the immune system is
      much more negative changes by negative, especially strong negative
      bioenergetic radiation than other body parts.<br>
      This can be seen from the following exemplary description: will a
      person with ideal bioenergetic values ??(OF = UF = zero) in a
      multi-electric light bulbs or fluorescent tubes strongly lit room,
      so you can already after 2 hours with said Copen Analytical
      Radionic Computer determine the aforementioned maximum value in
      the UF-region, namely UF in 1248, while other body parts have
      substantially lower UF values ??(equivalent to negative
      bioenergetic state values) for the immune system ("Copen-rate
      5327").<br>
      <br>
      The high significance of this observation for the health of humans
      is obvious, especially when one considers that (as stated at the
      outset) by prolonged and / or oftener in this regard the action of
      this radiation forming persistent negative or highly negative
      conditions that disappear either after some time ( = tansitorisch
      persistent negative bioenergetic state values), or persist over
      long periods, if not the above be performed in stage 3 mentioned
      measures.<br>
      <br>
      In the case of transitory persistent negative bioenergetic states
      are then also for example with said Radionic computer (parallel to
      the existence of high negative persistent state values ??in the
      immune system) the formation of measured values in the analysis of
      the condition value for "virus infection", Copen-code 70 064 ,
      determined, and indeed at a very early stage.<br>
      If a person in such a loaded additionally every night is now on a
      strong negative Erdstrahlader so advised the thus irradiated body
      organs and glands in a highly negative bioenergetic steady-state,
      from which evolve according to experience certain disease states.<br>
      <br>
      The above statement made also applies vice versa to the positive
      bio-energetic overload of the body, but with the passage of time
      can develop disease states which are fundamentally different from
      the damage caused by negative overload. The invention has to
      eliminate the target, the effects of various environmental factors
      described below.The necessary steps to keep the present invention
      the subtle equilibrium state, which is achieved with the correct
      implementation of the inventive method, largely constant.<br>
      <br>
      In accordance with these objectives, it is according to the
      invention required to take the following measures to substantially
      avoiding said bioenergetic fault conditions:<br>
      a) Optimization (= "normalization") of bioenergetic environment
      conditions during the illumination of rooms and seats <br>
      <br>
      In accompanying procedures Example 1 is found that when the
      illumination with electric bulbs, as well as in some of the
      commercially available fluorescent tubes as a "byproduct" a very
      strong negative polarized bioenergetic radiation is emitted.<br>
      <br>
      The intensity of this radiation depending on the power consumption
      and the distance of each lamp to lit subject can inventively by
      test exposures with different lamps on a subject (which was
      located in front of this experiment in the bioenergetic balance)
      depending on the duration of this radiation and are determined by
      the distance of the light source indirectly by the fact that in
      certain time intervals corresponding test samples (for example,
      fingerprints on the subject) is taken; these are then evaluated
      with the Radionic computer aforementioned. With negative polarized
      radiation UF values ??must then be obtained in this case.<br>
      <br>
      It was further stated in the procedure in Example 1, that in
      electronic energy saving lamps and in another part of the tubes
      due to design positive bioenergetic radiation is emitted. The
      quantity of these positive radiation, in the analogous manner as
      described above, are determined, with the difference that this
      radiation to the formation of positively polarized bioenergetic
      states in the subject leads. This positively polarized states are
      in relation to the OF-values ??which are determined in this case
      with said Radionic computer.<br>
      <br>
      The experiments described in Example 1 method that the high UF
      values ??that can be determined in a large part of the population
      currently, obviously must be blamed for most of the illumination
      with electric bulbs and fluorescent tubes with negative radiative.
      The same statement is true, consequently, for the above-described
      formation of persistent negative bioenergetic states. The present
      invention has, eliminate this influence primarily the subject.<br>
      <br>
      This invention occurs when negative radiant light bulbs with
      positive radiative electronic energy saving lamps, or
      alternatively negative radiant fluorescent tubes are sequentially
      mounted with positive radiative electronic power saving tubes
      under purposeful coordination of their consumption values ??that
      at start of the electric current in the respective area of ??this
      combination a reasonably neutral bioenergetic field results. The
      result of such a combination can be determined accurately by
      measuring the Radionic computer above, namely the achievement of a
      measured value of about "OF = UF = zero" at a person who was
      staying in the radiation area of ??this combination.<br>
      <br>
      So a reasonably neutral bioenergetic field is exemplified in the
      following combinations obtained:<br>
      - An electric light bulb 15 watts plus an electronic energy-saving
      lamp "Osram Dulux" 7 Watt;<br>
      - An electric light bulb, 25 watts, plus an electronic
      energy-saving lamp "Osram Dulux", 11 Watt;<br>
      - An electric light bulb, 40 watts, plus an electronic
      energy-saving lamp "Osram Dulux", 7 watts, plus an additional
      electronic power saving bulb "Osram Dulux", 11 Watt;<br>
      - A 120 cm long fluorescent tube "Philips TL 40W", plus a 60 cm
      long electronic power-saving tube "Lampi" 18 Watt.<br>
      b) eliminating by earth radiation bioenergetically adverse
      environments<br>
      (Completion of made in (1) relevant information)<br>
      From the extensive literature on earth rays and geopathy is known
      that the emergence of certain diseases is explained by the contact
      of the people so concerned with earth radiation.<br>
      The scientific evidence for this claim could not yet be supplied
      (4), (5), (6).<br>
      The reason is mainly the fact that the earth radiation previously
      could not be quantitatively measured with commercially available
      measuring instruments.<br>
      By exemplary work of Reinhard Schneider (2), (3), of the revealing
      of various Erdstrahltypen the calibrated dowsing ("V-antenna") and
      developed the Lecher Antenna TM, it was possible to prove the wave
      nature of earth radiation.<br>
      My research showed that all earth radiation is absorbed in water,
      therefore also in the human body, which contains about 80% water.<br>
      This makes them lose their different levels of intensity (=
      "kinetic energy"), but they have still their "basic substance",
      which was referred to in the above advance notification (1) as
      "bioenergy", and described speculation already in the previous
      literature has been.<br>
      In this quasi largely "dormant" state, this energy can indirectly,
      in particular in the human body, with said Radionic computer - as
      described above and in the aforementioned advance notification -
      be determined quantitatively.<br>
      When a person linger on such zones take namely with increasing
      exposure time the OF- resp. the UF values, see the relevant
      quantitative information in the methods in Examples 2 and 3. FIG.<br>
      Although the body radiates an increasing extent some of these
      recorded bioenergy from again; However, the verbeibende in body
      proportion leads to a further increase in OF- resp. the UF values,
      the aforementioned scale values ??reached or passed are.<br>
      From the measured values ??obtained in this way then draw
      conclusions about the quantity of radiation of this relevant
      Erdstrahladern can be taken.<br>
      According to the invention this effect of Earth rays be
      eliminated, that the respective dormitory or seat body through an
      "artificial aquifer" consisting respectively for example, from a
      sufficient number of coverage under each bed. the seat body
      adjacent water-filled canister against these bioenergetic
      radiation "stripped" is.<br>
      The success of such a measure can respectively by determining the
      UF.<br>
      OF values ??to said Radionic Computer at the person who dwelt on
      this lying or sitting position for several hours, to be
      determined.<br>
      These values ??must then at "OF = UF = zero" are when the above
      measure was carried out correctly.<br>
      It has been found that these artificial "water layer" enriched
      with the so absorbed bioenergetic radiation up to a certain limit
      at which the continuously supplied by the Earth Radiation
      Bioenergy holds off the scale with the radiation from the canister
      surface. The radiation intensity from the canister surface is in
      this case, however, - relatively to the intensity of the field
      lines - is substantially lower, so that at a 15-20 cm distance
      amounting to the canister surface of the body the latter is not
      affected by such "mild" bioenergetic radiation.<br>
      This operation will be described in greater detail in the
      accompanying Examples 2 and 3 process.<br>
      Apart from the above-described method for eliminating the earth
      radiation in the sleeping-places by absorption in water according
      to the invention has yet developed an alternative, namely the
      "method of localized compensate for the negative, resp. Positively
      polarized earth radiation".<br>
      This method is characterized in that in the radiation area of
      ??negative, respectively. positively polarized earth rays are
      taken at specific places measures to generate oppositely polarized
      bioenergetic radiation, in a targeted quantity, so that at this
      point an "annihilation" of the existing terrestrial radiation
      takes place, which is no longer carried out an otherwise occurred
      radiation exposure of persons concerned can.<br>
      This inventive measure is described in more detail in the
      procedures of Examples 2 and 3.<br>
      In order to carry out the described in such a novel process for
      the elimination of the unfavorable influence of earth rays
      bioenergetically on the human body without any problems, it is
      necessary for safety's sake, the heavily irradiated places
      respectively by a relevantly trained dowsers in each apartment for
      a bedroom.<br>
      Exclude seat. The success of such a measure can be determined
      respectively by a seat Liege test recommended by the dowsers place
      (duration 3 minutes) with Radionic computer analysis followed one
      after each 1/2, 1, 2 and 3 minutes, respectively seat. Hospital
      stay-built fingerprint sample on a clean transparent platelets. <br>
      c) optimization (= "normalization") of the bioenergetic conditions
      when driving in cars (passenger cars), which are operated with
      petrol engines In driving cars with petrol engines has been always
      a very strong negative polarized bioenergetic radiation, caused by
      the motor in operation, found. Since it can not be ruled out that
      positive bioenergetic polarized radiation is emitted due
      bauartiger differences in some cars, the polarization of this
      radiation must consequently be determined in the manner already
      described in each individual case.<br>
      <br>
      As described in Example 4 method, can already after about 12
      minutes driving time with the two of them located on the front
      seats of the people above in "Variant B" mentioned "step value" of
      "UF = 156" Setting. As mentioned in the introduction, can at long
      linger in a milieu in which this level value is determined to set
      a persistent bio-energetic state, which can be made to disappear
      only with the inventive measures again.<br>
      <br>
      It was determined according to the invention and described in
      Example incoming method that when driving in cars with petrol
      engines through the strategic use of battery-powered small
      fluorescent tubes that z.<br>
      B. from the car battery (12 volts) are fed, the described
      negatively polarized bioenergetic radiation is partially removed
      so that the occupants are no longer affected by the radiation
      emitted by Auto Motor radiation. The success of such a measure
      carried out can be confirmed with said Radionic computer,
      characterized by the determination of the already repeatedly
      described "normal state" when the person concerned ("OF = UF =
      zero").<br>

      </b><b> </b><br>
      "Normalization" (= "optimization") lying the aforementioned, on
      the outskirts of the setpoint "OF = UF = zero" values<br>
      The following measures come into consideration for this operation:<br>
      3a) normalization with specific, precisely defined
      Erdstrahlstreifen The relevant measures have already been
      described in the patent application P 42 04 709.9. The conditions
      for the proper execution of this method are:<br>
      - Exact determination of the required Erdstrahlqualität;<br>
      - Precise selection of options for specific application in each
      individual case;<br>
      - Exact implementation of each required evaluation of the actions
      undertaken with said Radionic computer.<br>
      - Meaningful and accurate selection of options for the
      normalization of their outside setpoints lying, obtained with said
      Radionic device OF- resp.<br>
      UF values ??in each normalization stage.<br>
      - The polarization of the individual, obtained with said Radionic
      device from the target state ("OF = UF = null") deviating values
      must be equal. A simultaneous reduction of UF values ??and
      OF-values ??as they can occasionally occur in practice, is not
      feasible in the direct use of earth radiation. In such cases the
      procedure in the description of the aforementioned patent
      application, namely in section '7.<br>
      Step, variant A, paragraph d "procedure described are applied,
      namely (simultaneously) combined with the in '7.<br>
      Step, variant B "procedure described - precisely controlled with
      said Radionic computer.<br>
      3b) normalization with negative radiant electric bulbs (with
      positive overload, so at elevated OF-values), respectively. with
      positive radiative electronic energy saving lamps (with negative
      overload, so at elevated UF values) The necessary measures are
      different from case to case, they must each means of testing
      sessions under the aforementioned lamps Considering be developed

      the polarization of the emitted by them bioenergetic radiation,

      Radionic- to identify computers on which, if necessary, to take
      corrections for the next measure (cf..<br>
      <br>
      <b>Examples 1f, 13 and 14<br>
        <br>
      </b><b> </b>Also in this method, it is required that the
      polarization of the individual obtained with said Radionic device,
      deviates from the desired state values ??is equal.<br>
      3c) normalization with fully operational galvanic small elements<br>
      <br>
      For example, "Duracell alkaline Px 825 / LR 53, 1.5 V" or "Kodak
      Photo Life Photo / Electronic Battery Alkaline KA 825, 1.5 V",
      either - in the case of negative or highly negative bioenergetic
      states - by supporting the Plus side of this small element to an
      appropriate skin site (for example on the forearm, or specifically
      on the area of ??skin over a highly negative body region), wherein
      the support side is optionally covered with a suitably tailored
      Leukoplaststreifen or with several layers of such strips, if such
      lesser duty of positive is influencing energy required or - in the
      case of positive or highly positive bioenergetic states - by
      supporting the minus side of such a small element to a skin site
      via a positive resp. highly positive body zone in an analogous
      manner.<br>
      The duration of the measure is respectively dependent on the level
      of OF-. the UF value before the edition of small element (resp =
      height of the target-OF-value. the target UF value immediately
      after removing the small element) on the number of successive

      objective pursued ; generally intended when exposed to positive
      bioenergy radiation the value OF = 25 to 30 do not respectively in
      the relevant part of the body. be exceeded only in exceptional
      cases, when acted upon by negative bioenergetic radiation a value
      of UF = 25 to 30 should not, resp. be exceeded only in exceptional
      cases.<br>
      After about 20 minutes checking whether the value OF = UF = "zero"
      was achieved permanently if not, the measure must be repeated
      until this is the case.<br>
      This 3c described in Section inventive normalization method is
      based on the surprising fact that the direct contact of said small
      element with the human skin bioenergetic radiation is emitted to
      this, where they spontaneously spreads to the whole body, but in
      this case, certain areas, such as blood (rate 409) or
      Symphathisches nervous system (rate 739) or parasympathetic
      nervous system (73910) always higher OF-, respectively. UF values.
      Further details on this can be seen from the method of Examples 11
      and 12.<br>
      3c may normalization method described above can be applied at
      various points of the body with simultaneous existence of positive
      and negative areas. Such cases have already been observed several
      times.<br>

      of permanent MagNeten. <br>
      This method is carried out analogously to the procedure described
      in 3c. However, since there are numerous different magnets have
      the appropriate normalization methods to be worked (with
      subsequent analysis by said Radionic computer) when you select
      this method by selecting the appropriate test series. Therefore,
      the above is carried out much easier and safer in 3c-called
      operation. Said normalization measures should be only on
      instructions to trained professionals, especially doctors, and
      under strict control by such persons carried out.<br>

      <b>Example 1</b><b><br>
      </b><b> <br>
      </b>Alteration of bioenergetic states of people under the
      influence of the lighting; Ways to solve this problem<br>
      a) Electric bulbs<br>
      It was established already in the German patent application
      mentioned that electric bulbs emit negative bioenergetic
      radiation. According to the invention has made it possible now on
      the basis of targeted attempts to make quantitative statements in
      this regard.<br>
      a1) change of bio-energetic states of a male person (72 kg) in the
      radiation area of ??a 40 watt bulb (initial state = OF 0.2). The
      distance between the head of the subject of the bulb was here (45
      ° angle from above): 40 cm<br>
      The listed values indicate a very high negative polarized state of
      these areas of the body upon exposure to an electric bulb 40
      watts.<br>
      Noticeable here is also the big difference between the respective
      values ??for rate 739 and rate 73910, so that this can be
      concluded upon irradiation with negative bioenergy on a skew of
      the function of the autonomic nervous system. As can be seen, the
      40 watt bulb for Council 29, 409, 98 and 739 stood the test in
      each case, an equilibrium state of UF 312 a.<br>
      This value is one of the above in "Variant B" mentioned stage
      numbers in UF range, as found in the present invention even when
      of excessive exposure to high-quality bio-energetic radiation as
      "persistent" bioenergetic status values. The value of UF 468 is
      exactly in the middle between the UF values ??312 and 624, both of
      which were listed in "Variant B" as persistent bioenergetic
      values. Due to this fact it is advisable to search for a state
      analysis necessary even after this UF value.<br>
      a2) A further experiment under the same conditions as in A1, but
      with two bulbs with 40 Watt found: The figures can be much higher
      equilibrium values ??with respect to the demonstration experiment
      described in section A1) expected.<br>
      a3) with increasing distance from a 40 watt bulb remove the UF
      values; Here distance for the Copen-rate 29 after 1 minute
      exposure time was measured namely only UF 4.0 at 1 m.<br>
      A4) In a further experiment with a 25 watt light bulb in 40 cm
      distance has been determined:<br>
      <br>
      b) Electronic energy saving lamps . Unlike electric incandescent
      lamps, emit negative bioenergy, produce electronic energy saving
      lamps, for example, the various types of "Osram Dulux EL TM" or
      "Philips SL" or "Philips PLC Electronic" positive bioenergetic
      radiation. So following OF-values ??were at a person who (DEG
      angle obliquely from above in 45) was illuminated by an electronic
      energy-saving lamp "Osram Dulux 20W" 20 cm, determined when
      analyzing the Radionic computer mentioned:<br>
      The observed here equilibrium values ??of OF 360 (for 29 rate)
      respectively. OF 480 (for rate 73910) have already been mentioned
      at the outset of this specification; as described there, it can
      also be determined as a "persistent" values ??during prolonged
      exposure to positively polarized bioenergetic radiation.<br>
      c) Inventive measures to prevent the above-described exceptionally
      strong influence of electric bulbs, respectively. electronic
      energy saving lamps on the bioenergetic equilibrium of man It was
      determined according to the invention that an optimization of the
      bioenergetic conditions while staying in lit rooms is achieved by
      the fact that electric light bulbs on the one hand, and electronic
      energy-saving lamps on the other hand to one another so installed
      in close proximity to each other and purposeful coordination of
      their bioenergetic radiation properties that when you switch the
      electric current in the ideal case, results in a substantially
      optimum bio-energy radiation field, characterized by the avoidance
      of high OF-, resp. UF values ??in the analysis of a person who
      resided in the radiation field of this combination, with the
      Radionic computer aforementioned. Ideally, can be achieved with
      precise and proper operation of the "setpoint" of OF = UF = zero
      ".<br>
      So, for example by combining a standard 25-watt incandescent bulb
      with an electronic 11-watt energy-saving lamp "Osram Dulux SL" at
      a horizontal distance of 20 cm between two lamps and at a distance
      of these lamps from the head of a subject of about 40 cm (45 °
      down) after 3 minutes exposure time the following values ??with
      the initially described Radionic- computer calculated: for rates
      29: OF 0.2<br>
      for rate 409: OF 0.2<br>
      for rate 73910: OF 0.2<br>
      The same result was achieved by combining an electric 40-watt
      incandescent with a 11 watt energy-saving lamp "Osram Dulux SL"
      plus an additional one 7-watt energy-saving lamp "Osram Dulux SL"
      in a 3armigen hanging lamp above a table (removal of the
      individual Lamps from the head of the subject zwsichen 40 and 60
      cm). Prerequisite for this result was of course that the subject
      was in the ideal bioenergetic state even before the said
      irradiation experiment. A particular embodiment of problem solving
      outlined in the present case is that the combination described
      (for achieving a neutral environment in the area of bio-energy
      lamp types mentioned) is producing technically realized in each
      one unit with a socket.<br>
      d) fluorescent tubes<br>
      d1) fluorescent "old style" generally send out a very strong
      negative bioenergetic radiation considerably wider than the
      radiation of light bulbs.<br>
      So when a person who is located in the radiation field of a
      fluorescent tube "Philips TL 20 W / 29" a UF value of 66.9 (60 cm
      long), and staying true 200 cm away from this, after 1 minute was
      measured.<br>
      The bioenergetic radiation of fluorescent tube also goes through
      walls and ceilings virtually unrestrained therethrough; this fact
      should not be forgotten for staying in such rooms.<br>
      In a large department store, which was also evident during the day
      from the ceiling with a large number of fluorescent tubes (about
      10 clock in the morning) were about 1.70 away at a under a
      fluorescent tube double aggregate subject (from the head of the
      subject ) following bioenergetic values ??when evaluating the
      Radionic computer aforementioned ermititelt:<br>
      These figures show the extraordinarily great influence of negative
      radiant fluorescent in the mentioned conditions, particularly in
      terms of the operating personnel of the department store, which
      has to remain under these conditions for many hours a day.<br>
      d2) It was further found that in the market also positive
      bioenergetic radiation emitting light tubes are available, some of
      which are referred to as "energy-saving tubes", but on the other
      hand, have no special marking. Consequently, the polarization of
      its radiation in each individual case must be determined by using
      a fluorescent tube.<br>
      In a 200 cm of an in-service fluorescent lamp "Lampi", Type 1318
      (18 Watt), remote test subject was after 1 minute irradiation time
      for Rate 29 (brain) of the value OF = 22.1 determines the Radionic
      computer aforementioned.<br>
      described e) Inventive measures to prevent the above in section d)
      exceptionally strong influence of fluorescent tubes on the
      bio-energetic equilibrium of the human being It was determined
      according to the invention that an optimization of the
      bioenergetic conditions during their stay in rooms that are lit by
      fluorescent tubes, is achieved, on the one hand each have a
      negative bioenergy emanating when in any room to be illuminated
      part as a byproduct fluorescent tube and on the other hand a
      positive bioenergy emitting byproduct fluorescent tube preferably
      in parallel arrangement to each other is mounted (for example, at
      a distance of about 10 cm) on the ceiling or on a workplace where
      this installation is in purposeful coordination of their
      quantitative bioenergetic radiation characteristics, so that as a
      result of this targeted action with the involvement of the
      electric current about bioenergetically neutral radiation field
      results. In this case, when a person who was in the radiation
      field itself, with a Radionic analysis of value OF = UF = "zero"
      or a value determined in close proximity to this ideal value. A
      specific embodiment of the invention set out problem solving is
      that the combination of the two fluorescent tubes types described
      above is producing excessively realized in an aggregate with
      guaranteed optimal bioenergetic radiation quality.<br>
      f) Example of a moderate positive bioenergetic radiation<br>
      An electronic energy-saving lamp "Dulux" 7 Watt has been placed on
      a table, that the distance was exactly 95 cm at a distance at the
      other end of the table seated person (at head height).<br>
      After switching on the electric current after 1 minute following
      OF-values ??were determined: The figures show that in this way
      only a moderate positive irradiation takes place, as, where
      appropriate, as described in "Stage 2 of the inventive method"
      inventive method to normalize negative persistent state values
      ??comes into question. However, in this case the distance of the
      body is precisely observed by the lamp.<br>

      Alteration of bioenergetic states while lying on a positively
      polarized Erdstrahlenfeld; inventive measures to solve this
      problem<br>
      For the demonstration of inventive measures described in this
      example, a 15stufiges positive polarized, linearly extending
      Erdstrahlfeld was selected.<br>
      This Erdstrahlfeld is part of a north-south / east-west oriented
      electromagnetic radiation latticed system with a width of each
      (linearly extending) single field of 6.4 m and having a mesh size
      of the mesh grid of approximately 40 meters; it is the main artery
      of a so-called "geomancy Zone", which is described in (3) p 143
      and in (6) pp 86-88, induced.<br>
      Every single box has a 80 cm wide middle section with 5 very thin
      radiation strips each have a distance of 20 cm and a very high
      irradiance.<br>
      After both sides of this central panel, depending 7 fields close
      to each 40 cm wide, in each field each 2 radiating strips are
      spaced evenly graded intensity.<br>
      A bedstead of length was removed exactly 140 cm from the middle of
      the field described by asked about the radiation strip located
      there, so that this accurately irradiated the longitudinal center
      back one located on the deck person. Partially even the two 20 cm
      distant neighboring strips were thereby detected. After 1 to 2
      minutes then a fingerprint on a transparent film was made in each
      case.<br>
      These fingerprints were analyzed with the computer Radionic
      mentioned. Result in the setting 409 for "blood": 1 minute time
      spent: OF 31.5<br>
      2 minutes time spent: OF 62.6 As noted, the OF-value should after
      one minute at most OF = be 2.0 to the formation of very high
      values ??OF prolonged time spent, during the night or to be
      avoided in an even longer stay during an illness, as would
      otherwise be expected to occur the aforementioned "persistent
      bioenergetic state values". Following this test, the lying area
      was comprehensively "stripped" by closely spaced on the floor
      water-filled plastic canister against the positive earth rays. The
      water level in the canisters lying was 15 cm.<br>
      After a waiting period of 6 hours (within which the positively
      polarized radiation energy of located under the canisters earth
      rays had accumulated in the water that was in the canisters, until
      saturation) of the above-deck experiment described was repeated,
      then again removed a fingerprint and this is evaluated in the
      manner described; Result: OF = UF = zero.<br>
      The deck with the plastic canisters underneath was then left for
      24 hours in the same position and repeat the aforementioned sun
      trial.<br>
      Result: OF = UF = zero in the subject. An alternative to the
      above-described demonstration experiment: After removal of the
      water-filled canister used for the "stripping" two 15-watt light
      bulbs were placed in the basement beneath the bedstead so that a
      45 cm below the shoulder region, the second 45 cm below the belly
      area was. Evaluation of a further experiment with the sun Radionic
      computers also yielded "OF = UF = zero". This result is
      surprising, as at this point, given the very high positive
      radiation, a far higher use of negative bioenergetic radiation was
      to be expected for a "compensation".<br>
      The reason for this lies in the fact that it (ie only to a
      localized compensation) acted in this case to a "blocking" of
      relevance here strong positive radiation.<br>
      In another sun attempt a subject, on the central artery of the
      above-described 80 cm wide middle part (this vein has - determined
      by radiesthetic methods - the highest radiation intensity of
      Erdstrahlfeldes described), after 1 to 2 minutes time spent in the
      subject following OF-values determined:<br>

      </b>Alteration of bioenergetic states while lying on a negatively

      For the demonstration of inventive measures described in this

      selected, namely a zone of so-called "Wasserader- grid system".
      Such a system is induced by the bioenergetic radiation energy

      As can be seen, the UF values ??strive both for blood as well as
      for the brain to the limit UF = 156, although the initial values
      ??for blood is about 20% higher than those for the brain. This
      value of UF 156 characterizes the state of equilibrium between the
      radiated and the bioenergetic emitted radiation; He is one of the
      negative bioenergetic scale values ??that were "Variant B"
      described at the beginning of the process description in section.
      He is also one of the eventualities "persistent" negative
      bioenergetic state values, how they can be set at negative
      endurance. <br>
      <br>
      Detailed description of the present Example 3 experimental
      conditions:<br>
      <br>
      The used for the demonstration experiment described above "water
      vein-grid system" is a north-south / east-west oriented; The
      individual strips of this grid are each composed of a central core
      and 2 beleitenden secondary veins, each with about 16 cm away from
      the central core. These funds can artery after thorough
      radiaesthetischer training with the K antenna by Reinhard
      Schneider, Wertheim, and indeed at the set "Handle length" 24.5
      cm, DEG -Peilverfahren be found in 45. A bed was made precisely
      with its longitudinal central axis in such a water-lattice

      one hand the central artery, on the other hand, the right adrenal
      vein irradiated head, the left half of the body and the left leg,
      the right half of the body and the right leg. The subject was at
      this time in the "bioenergetic balance" ("OF = UF = null") when
      analyzing the aforementioned Radionic computer. Approximately 1
      hour after the aforementioned sun trial the lying surface, in the
      same manner as described in Example 2, comprehensively stripped
      with water-filled canisters against the negative bioenergetic
      radiation, the distance of the body of the canister surface was
      about 30 cm. The experiment was carried out 8 hours (overnight)
      and the next morning performed Radionic computer analysis: Result:
      "OF = UF = zero" in the subject. Subsequently, the water-cans were
      removed and then carried out a second sun trial under the
      following conditions: First, it was in the basement under the
      bedstead a positive bioenergetic radiation emitting fluorescent

      80 cm from the body surface of the subject removed, and then kept
      for 2 hours in operation. The evaluation of a fingerprint of the
      subject with said Radionic computer showed again: OF = UF = zero

      <b>Example 4</b><b><br>
      </b><b> <br>
      </b>Alteration of bioenergetic states while driving in automobiles
      that are powered by gasoline engines; inventive measure to solve
      this problem It was a test drive in a BMW 525e over 23 minutes
      out; every minute was taken off a fingerprint sample the
      passenger. The analysis of these samples revealed: <br>
      When a person in the back seat was after 4 minutes traveling time
      of the aforementioned scale value "UF 19.75" measured. From this
      it can be seen:<br>
      1) The increase of the UF values ??with increasing duration of
      exposure is a little steeper than for the conditions described in
      Example 3 in this example.<br>
      2) As with the experimental results according to Example 3 is in
      the brain and in the blood, a limit of UF = 156 achieved, but at
      an earlier stage than with the conditions according to Example 3.
      FIG.<br>
      3) This value of UF 156 is a negative bioenergetic level values,
      as they were initially called the procedure description in section
      "Variant B", and how they - may also exist in persistent state -
      as already outlined.<br>
      4) The UF values ??for the epiphysis are about 10% higher than
      those of the blood; the equilibrium value while charging is UF
      234th This value is reached after a 20 minute drive. The Uf value
      of UF 234 is exactly in the middle between the aforementioned
      UF-stage UF values ??156.0 and UF 312; He is obviously a further
      step value. It can be expected that it can also occur in
      persistent state.<br>
      5) The Uf value of 'UF 234', in setting the aforementioned code of
      15 dials (= "376379") and additional prescreening of 8 tens
      Wählschieben, each set to the number "10", and additional
      adjustment of the final number "4" to be realized on the
      UF-selector. It has been prepared according to the invention the
      following method to prevent the negatively polarized by Auto Motor
      generated bioenergetic radiation:<br>
      Before each of the two front seats each has a tubular small lamp
      "FL 1 Twin" (Hartig &amp; Helling manufacturer), 6 volts, mounted.
      These two small lamps were turned on simultaneously with the
      starting of the car engine; thereby generated by the motor
      bioenergetic radiation before the persons present on these seats
      was largely blocked; it was surprising as the two persons there
      befndlichen as determined even at the present on the rear seat
      persons, practically no negative bioenergetic radiation more. The
      said two small lights can be connected in series connection to the
      vehicle's own lighting system (12 volts).<br>
      Then said two small lights are switched on when the engine is
      started and switched off when shutting down the engine by an
      adapted circuit. Through this inventive measures it is ensured
      that the two small lamps in operation only during the lifetime of
      the engine. The above-described inventive operation applies only
      to the car engines which emit negative bioenergetic radiation.<br>
      Since it can not be excluded that also positively polarized
      radiation can be emitted as a result of construction-related
      difference of another motor car, it is necessary that before
      carrying out the inventive method, first, the polarization of the
      output from the respective motor bioenergetic radiation is
      determined. In the case of delivery of positive polarized
      bioenergetic radiation from the car engine, a local block the said
      radiation could then customized installation of electric bulbs 12
      volts (as used for example for the interior lighting of cars)
      before the two front car seats can be achieved. Of course, the
      visible light should be largely eliminated by a suitable cover of
      this lamp.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 5</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      Alteration of bioenergetic states in radiation field of a
      television set turned on; inventive measures to solve this problem
      It was found that in operation located TVs emit positive
      bioenergetic radiation.<br>
      This radiation can be partially or completely slowed down by
      negative Erdstrahlfelder that lie between the TV and the viewer. A
      basic numerical statement on this is therefore not possible.<br>
      To demonstrate the radiation of a TV, a seat test with a person 75
      cm behind a turned-TV "Grundig Super Color, 220 volt, 50 Hz, GSC
      600" was carried out. The bioenergetic radiation goes here
      kugelschalig to the TV around, the distances between the
      individual spherical shells are placed 20 cm apart. The radiation
      intensity decreases with increasing distance from the TV. Under
      the conditions mentioned below OF- were at a subject that was 75
      cm behind the mentioned TV, values ??in the evaluation with the
      eingnags mentioned Radionic computer measured. The figures show
      the extraordinary large bioenergetic influence on people when he
      is too close to the switched-on TV. As is apparent from the table
      that OF-values ??strive different limit values ??to at 23minütigen
      duration of the experiment, namely for the brain (coPEN code 29) =
      CF 180 after 21 minutes and the blood (409) = CF 240 after 23
      minutes. For the epiphysis (code 98 = pineal gland, pineal gland)
      was 360 not quite reached the expected limit of CF after this
      time, however, the tendency of these figures towards this limit is
      obvious. <br>
      <br>
      For the above figures show that an audience should stop possible
      4-5 m far away from the TV. This statement also applies to the
      spaces above or below or behind or next to the television set.<br>
      Since - as mentioned above - the positive radiation of the TV can
      be partially or completely eliminated by negative Erdstrahlfelder,
      located between the device and the audience, the remaining
      radiation for each individual case must be determined
      experimentally.<br>
      <br>
      According to the invention, this residual radiation is compensated
      in that between the TV and observers a powered electric bulb
      (which - as mentioned in Example 1 - has negative bioenergetic
      radiance) is placed; this has from the operator the strength of
      the light bulb and the distance from the audience are chosen
      experimentally so that the viewer takes no more bioenergetic
      radiation, characterized by the achievement of bioenergetic
      Gleichgewichswertes "by 1000 = about zero" in the analysis with
      said Radionic Computers.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 6</b><b><br>
      </b><b> Impact of high-voltage lines on the bioenergetic state of
        the human being</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      Under high voltage lines, there is a strong positive polarized
      field with great reach. Measurement tests in the manner as
      described several times showed that in individuals who are in the
      radiation field directly under the high voltage line, high-OF
      values ??(determined in the manner described above) are measured.
      So (about 4 m distance of the head of a subject from the second
      lead wire) after 1 minute residence time, a value of 34.5 OF
      (setting Copen-rate 29 = brain) was measured directly by a
      high-voltage cable with 6 wires; After 15 minutes of residence
      time of the equilibrium value is reached, namely, "OF 180".<br>
      When hiring rate 73 190 (for parasympathetic nervous system) was
      found as the equilibrium value "OF 240". Because these
      high-voltage lines passing through a residential area, is
      consequently to be expected with a corresponding burden on the
      people living in these apartments. As a countermeasure, the
      installation of negative radiation-emitting bulbs comes resp.
      fluorescent lamps (eg. on the ceiling or above the ceiling of the
      inhabited rooms) into consideration. The use of these lamps must
      be experimentally (in compliance with the undertaking given in
      Example 1 versions) so that people who are in such spaces, in the
      analysis with said Radionic computer the bioenergetic setpoint (OF
      = UF = approximately zero ") having, when these lamps are turned
      on. Other possible alternative: install an artificial layer of
      water in the attic similar to that described in Example 2. <br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 7</b><b><br>
      </b><b> Determination of bioenergetic radiation of E train

      of this person was about 3 meters from the catenary.<br>
      After exactly 1 minute and after exactly 3 minutes each
      fingerprint was taken at this person.<br>
      The analysis of this fingerprint with said Radionic computer
      revealed when setting the rate 29 (brain) resp. the rate 73 910
      (parasympathetic nervous system):<br>
      &lt;Img class = "EMIRef" id = "021796016-00360001" /&gt;<br>
      These figures demonstrate a very high release of positive
      bioenergy radiation which consequently reigns in the interior of
      railway wagons.<br>
      As a solution to this problem is similar to that of Example 6, the
      installation of light bulbs and / or fluorescent tubes into
      consideration, so that then results in a neutral bioenergetic
      field in the passenger compartment after the commissioning of
      these lamps.<br>

      MHz", namely 45 cm in front of the device on the person following
      positive charges with the were mentioned Radionic computer
      determines: after 1 minute: OF 36.4, after 4 minutes: OF 134.5.<br>
      Consequences of this test run:<br>
      1. The bioenergetic radiation generated in the interior of the
      microwave oven also penetrates through the oven door to the
      outside and can be found there on several occasions described as a
      high-OF-value at a person located there according to the
      invention.<br>
      2 Because - as described above - this bio-energetic radiation is
      water soluble, is therefore at a very high accumulation of this
      radiation can be expected in the food found there.<br>
      3 Since these foods are consumed immediately afterwards generally,
      thus this radiation then passes to the affected people, where it
      leads to the corresponding change in the bioenergetic
      measurements.<br>

      following OF-values ??were determined with the Radionic computer
      mentioned:<br>
      after 1 minute: OF = 29.4, after 4 minutes: OF = 106.0. These
      figures show that also be released during the operation of

      test plates was evaluated with the aforementioned Radionic
      computer.<br>
      Result: UF = 23.9 (for 29 rate).<br>
      This result proves the very high discharge of negatively polarized
      bioenergetic radiation during proximal linger on heating pads and

      From this experiment results in the realization that electric
      heating pads and electric blankets cause unwanted gain of this

      exactly 1/2, 1, 2, 6 and 30 minutes, respectively, a fingerprint
      was taken on a transparent sheet and these evaluated with said
      Radionic computer. The experimental results show that already
      after 2 minutes constant OF-values ??are achieved at a low level,
      namely for the brain (rate 29), for the blood (rate 409) and for
      the sympathetic nervous system OF7,5 and the parasympathetic
      nervous system OF 11.25. The value "OF 7.5" was not mentioned
      above in "A variant of the inventive process," he, however, lies
      precisely in the middle between "OF = UF = zero" and the step
      value "OF 15" mentioned. As a persistent value is this

      the above finding does not rule out that it may exist persistent.
      The same applies to the found intermediates value "OF 11.25" for
      the parasympathetic nervous system. This figure is exactly in the

        <b> Arrangement with bioenergetic activity</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      In order reliably and conveniently to exert an influence over a
      prolonged period with reproducible repetition by substrates which
      have bioenergetic activity and are of various types on the points
      or regions, which can be influenced by bioenergy, on the surface
      of living bodies, in particular humans and animals, it is provided
      according to the invention that the substrates are applied to
      items surrounding the living bodies, e.g. clothing.<br>
      <br>
      The invention relates to a bio-energetically to living beings, and
      in particular people effective arrangement and is based on the
      known fact that, for example, in humans, a variety of
      bio-energetically effective and impressionable points or Areas
      exist at various locations of the body or the body surface.<br>
      <br>
      These points or Spaces on specific bioenergetic potentials or Set
      potential areas and are not only with the organs inside the body
      in conjunction, but also among themselves to a characteristic
      potential pattern reticulate interlinked.<br>
      <br>
      It is made of different ancient teachings, such of acupuncture and
      chakra, known and detectable with today modern Analysgeräten that
      the well-being and the health of living creatures, especially
      human animal from a very correct, biologically optimal applied
      potential pattern, ie dependent on the adjustments in the
      bioenergetic points.<br>
      <br>
      There are also a variety of methods known to influence by various
      influencing the impressionable bioenergetically points or regions
      whose participation impact on the health setting or the wellbeing
      of the body.<br>
      For this purpose only, acupuncture, acupressure, Colorpuncture,
      reflexology, neural therapy, laying and rubbing of active
      substances, Homöopressur, Chakreneinwirkung be mentioned as some
      examples, such as Aids acupuncture needles, magnets, crystals,
      natural active ingredients and for some years also lasers are
      known.<br>
      <br>
      A major drawback of these methods lies in the fact that their
      therapeutic application because of this acting extremely low
      energies and the biologically determined only very slow energy
      flow a certain treatment time and a regular rhythm of repetition
      single treatments needed in particular.<br>
      <br>
      The fact that the working man nowadays it applies neither time nor
      patience, probably one of the reasons for an often alleged
      uncertain reproducibility of the results are healing.<br>
      In addition, due to the network-like linking the interaction of
      the points or areas within the characteristic potential pattern
      often the bioenergetic treatment at several places at the same
      time, which is difficult to achieve in the available time limits.<br>
      <br>
      Especially the multiple stress stress today also makes it more and
      more often a certain duration or treatment Influencing the
      bioenergeisch effective points necessary.<br>
      <br>
      The object of the invention is to provide an arrangement with
      which a frequent or permanent assignment of energetically
      effective substrates to the so impressionable points or areas on
      the body or the skin of the people as uniform as possible
      influence over a longer period and particularly in the
      simultaneous combination several spheres of influence can be
      ensured in the most comfortable manner.<br>
      <br>
      Here this also each have different bioenergetic effective
      substrates can be assigned in combination.<br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, the invention resides in the parent meaning that at
      the jurisdictions of the living creatures, eg. of man,
      energetically effective substrates through this sphere of
      influence locally assigned attachment surrounding objects are
      provided in particular to the people.<br>
      <br>
      Such a specific association of active energy substrates to the
      individual body parts of the people according to the invention is
      possible with all objects, the man carries a continuous or a long
      time to be such&nbsp; garments, especially undergarments,
      Bekleidungsaccessoirs ( gloves, headgear, wrist warmers, kneepads,
      headbands, wristbands or -hafteinlagen, eyeglasses, etc.).<br>
      <br>
      Therefore, the substrates need not necessarily on the skin surface
      to rest, but can also be arranged overlying.<br>
      <br>
      However, the substrates which points should be influenced in terms
      of area or Areas covered.<br>
      <br>
      Other options such inevitable assignment, ie without the person
      concerned does not have to constantly think it is the attachment
      to other, surrounding people everyday objects such as blankets,
      table and bed sheets, sofa and pillows, furniture
      (Sesselarmstütze), chairs, table tops , floor coverings, etc.,
      wherein the attachment of the active energy substrates may also be
      provided in more large-scale form.<br>
      Other inventively substrate excessively groomed items that get
      more sporadic, but often very intense in contact with the person
      who can machine parts or their controls (lever machines, steering
      wheel or<br>
      Its lever of cars, household appliances, etc.) or sports equipment
      (tennis rackets, bicycle handlebar grips and -Sattel etc.).<br>
      <br>
      Essentially, the invention is also the fact that the known
      bioenergetically effective substrates to the objects, eg. Other
      example of body clothing in a simple manner and are removably
      mountable, and without that the substrates to be disturbing (or
      friction Chafing, pressure) are perceived.<br>
      <br>
      This applies in particular when the substrates have to be mounted
      on the most intense contact manner, namely on the inner side of
      the body covering.<br>
      <br>
      In particular, it comes to the use of such Velcro straps or
      Sticking or clamping question.<br>
      <br>
      At least during the day acting permanent interference is to think
      about weaving, sewing or embroider.<br>
      <br>
      In the aforementioned manner any kind of combination in terms of
      time and with respect to the local association as well as the type
      of substrate used can be selected and set, but also be easily
      modified.<br>
      You can choose between all available bioenergetically effective
      substrates, in particular color and shape icons (eg. helix
      pattern) and different materials are combined according to
      necessity.<br>
      <br>
      The substrates, like the mentioned geometrical symbols or Figures
      are the associated local points respectively Areas (eg. a
      Chakrenzentrum) in size sufficient overlap area.<br>
      <br>
      Ultimately, wallpaper, curtains and the like, surrounding the
      objects people can be equipped with appropriate substrates.<br>
      <br>
      The invention is explained in more detail below in exemplary
      embodiments.<br>

      Of these, the points 2a, 1b and 1c 2b and 2c are coverable by
      substrates at a camisole, the point 2a by underarm sweat leaves
      the point 1a by a hat and points by a pair of underpants.<br>
      <br>
      At an undershirt also substrates for the points 4a and 4b and 5a
      and 5b corresponding to the lung point Bl 13 and the little
      Yin-point Bl 14 are attachable.<br>
      <br>
