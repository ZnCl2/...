      <p><br>
        A Whakatane-based scientist believes he is helping to create one
        of the greatest breakthroughs in human history. Denise Landau
        talks alternative clean energy production with one of the
        world's leading energy scientists. </p>
      <div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; <br>
        After a lifetime devoted to researching alternative clean energy
        production Dr Robert Adams is about to publish his latest work
        which shows that aether, the building block of the physical
        universe, can be freely harnessed to produce clean,
        pollution-free energy.</div>
      <p><br>
        Now aged 80, Dr Adams and his colleagues new work delivers
        mankind on to the doorstep of an unimaginably exciting and
        awe-inspiring future. </p>
      <div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; <br>
        Take any image of science fiction and open your mind because
        that's the direction this new world of aether energy is
        offering, says Dr Adams.</div>
      <p><br>
        He is internationally recognised as one of the world's five
        leading scientists in the field of research into the new clean
        energy technologies. </p>
      <p>Aether scientists believe their discoveries effectively
        eliminate the theories of relativity and traditional views of
        physics and cosmology. </p>
      <p>An international network of maverick "behind the scenes"
        scientists, such as Whakatane's Adams, is on the brink of
        publicly challenging the traditional Western scientific
        establishment. </p>
      <p>They sincerely believe that the Earth's and the human race's
        very survival depends upon it. </p>
      <p>Dr Adams says many ancient cultures were aware of the power of
        aether energy and used it for their people's and the
        environment's betterment. </p>
      <p>So what is the aether and how can it be applied to our lives
        today? </p>
      <p>Scientists describe aether as a superfluidic particulate medium
        which pervades all space - it is the building block of the
        physical universe. The medium, in one of its forms, is
        responsible for gravity and inertia. </p>
      <p>They even go so far to say it is a medium controllable by mind
        and can be manipulated by thought. </p>
      <p>Does a memory from the movie, Star Wars, and its mystical
        element illustrated by the Force ring any bells here? </p>
      <p>Scientifically, these "outside the square" thinking individuals
        call themselves new energy scientists and Dr Adams latest book
        is entitled Special Update 2000 edition of Applied Modern 20th
        Century Aether Science. </p>
      <p>"This new energy technology is going to change the world we
        live in on an immense scale." </p>
      <p>Dr Adams formally lays claim to discovering a new law of
        Nature, which he designates 'the Adams Law'. </p>
      <p>"I have proved over hundreds of thousands of hours of hard
        labour at laboratory benches and machine shops, that these
        aethric energies are manifesting at unity/zero point, whereby
        the bottom line is that there is no longer any reference point
        from which to base any kind of so-called 'efficiency' test." </p>
      <p>Dr Adams' latest invention does read like something taken
        straight out of a Star Trek episode - the Adams triplex aethric
        energy motor generator. </p>
      <p>This device is a super power, thermo, impulse, salient pole,
        open magnetic circuit, repulsion, self-starting, reluctance
        electric motor generator. </p>
      <p>The motor generator is so named because of it's unorthodox and
        unusual ability to manifest considerable aetheric energy from
        three different areas of the machine. </p>
      <p>He says the revolutionary machine, the first of its kind in the
        world, provides economical, clean, safe power. </p>
      <p>What it means, says Dr Adams, is every fossil-fuelled and
        nuclear power station in the world could be shut down in the
        space of three years. </p>
      <p>Dr Adams talks about expanded inductive energy and energy
        harnessed at the air gap between his machine's rotors and
        stators. These two elements combined provides the driving power
        of the motor. </p>
      <p>"The important roles played by these two sources of force have
        never before been properly highlighted. </p>
      <p>"They have eluded mainstream academia and scientists for over a
        century in regard to their vital importance in machine design,
        and this explains why electric motors have never beer improved
        upon during these past 100 or so years." </p>
      <p>He adds that it is incredible to realise that electrical
        engineers and scientists in this modern age of technology are
        still taught to use free trapped electromagnetic energy to
        destroy the source of the said energy, by placing these 'stone
        age' motors across the national grid systems and/or battery
        energy sources. </p>
      <p>"In this brutal way, millions of megawatts of energy is wasted
        daily throughout the world and there is no excuse for allowing
        such a monstrous waste to persist any longer." </p>
      <p>His supporting written documentation includes papers written by
        eminent scientific pioneers in ferromagnetics and aether
        technology, including the United Kingdom's pioneering engineer
        Dr Harold Aspden. </p>
      <p>Dr Adams says his book contains the revelation of the century
        and is packed with undeniable evidence of the presence of the
        aether and it's awesome powers. </p>
      <p>This exploration into the vast frontier of aether energy
        science technologies also outlines part of his own journey
        through the corridors of a fascinating and challenging world of
        new, clean, safe and inexhaustible source of energy, he says. </p>
      <p>Dr Adams shares his own vital discoveries and experiences from
        a lifetime of critical analyses on the subject in conjunction
        with his collaborating colleagues world-wide. </p>
      <p>He includes scientific papers written by scientists of eminence
        and international repute as pioneers in the fields of
        ferromagnetics and aether technology. </p>
      <p>Dr Adams also deals with his own sceptics - with reverence and
        caustic soda alike - and includes some of their narratives. </p>
      <p>The book is a biography and a significant contribution to the
        history of modern day true science, a record if discovery and
        innovation which is fertile and absorbing, he believes. </p>
      <p>"In writing this special update I am donating into the public
        domain further valuable information. </p>
      <p>"This is particularly for the benefit of those interested in
        the new, clean free energy sciences with the view to fostering
        encouragement for these people, to join in the rank of their
        pioneers by collaborating and sharing information on an
        international basis." </p>
      <p>Four years ago, former New Zealand Minister of Energy, Doug
        Kidd, publicly stated his belief in the concept of "over unity"
        machines operating in laboratories overseas at an address to the
        annual general meeting of The Energy Efficiency and Conservation
        Authority. </p>
      <p>Mr Kidd referred to the almost science-fiction field of
        over-unity where new machines recorded output power at 28 times
        greater than input power from the likes of the Patterson power
        cell and where power continues to be produced long after the
        input source is turned off. </p>
      <p>"I'm not talking about nuclear power," Mr Kidd explained. But
        the restrained anarchist lurking deep inside me is tickled by
        the thought that your line monopoly ... could become worthless
        junk, as would the dinosaur at Huntly and the large hunks of
        concrete we call hydro stations would become marginal stations.
      </p>
      <p>"According to accepted notions of physics, it is not possible.
        But once upon a time it was accepted wisdom that the sun
        revolved around the Earth. Your life depended on believing it!"

        Imagine your own plant at home, business, factory, milking shed,
        etc., to name but a few of the scores of sites and applications
        for such a device. Sounds like a dream? </p>
      <div style="text-align: left;">No, it is no dream.&nbsp;
        Development of such a technology has been on-going right here in
        New Zealand in the Bay of Plenty for some years now by an
        internationally recognized scientist by the name of Dr. Robert
        Adams of Aethmogen Technologies.</div>
      <p><br>
        Unprecedented progress is underway worldwide on new energy
        devices. Such devices will one day in the near future pave the
        way to the time when we will see an end to pollution. Such
        devices will play an enormous role in the doing away with the
        monstrosities we call power stations which presently interfere
        with our waterways and, especially in the case of the coal and
        oil fired stations polluting the air we breathe. Hydro stations
        with their pylons and substations straddling the countryside
        will meet a similar fate. The time will come when grid systems
        will not be sustainable even to the most affluent of nations and
        the world will have to turn to simpler and more cost effictive
        alternatives. Power stations, just as the computer industry has
        done, will downsize quite dramatically and continue to do so
        rapidly until establishments such as hospitals, universities,
        factories, etc., will no longer be their guests. Eventually the
        smaller new energy devices will accommodate these guests and
        they will become self-sustaining as will individual residents
        who will be able to own and operate their own power supply at a
        "one-off" cost and store these individual units quite
        comfortably in their basements or garages. </p>
      <p>Dr. Adams has authored a new book on his own technologies
        titled "Special Update 2001 Edition of Applied Modern 20th
        Century Aether Science". This book covers the subjects of nature
        and pollution, politics, the environment, hte scientific
        establishment with its false teachings, aether energy
        technologies ond devices, modern calorimetric aether power
        measurement techniques, thermo-moter-generators, aetheric energy
        from mosfets and magnets, conventional electric motors and
        generators, etc. </p>
      <p>Dr. Adams has, for over fifty years, had serious concerns over
        environmental pollution, having himself been involved at the
        coal face with power plants in New Zealand in his younger years.
        This concern has underwritten a virtual lifetime of work
        researching alternative energy. His concerns for his own country
        go deep - he states: </p>
      <p>"New Zealand has, over many decades now, persistently exhibited
        a complex of lethargy towards its inventors and innovators in
        general - the sad and inevitable outcome if this attitude, as
        seen iover recent television programmes, has seen hoardes of the
        creme de la creme desert these shores carrying with them their
        innovations to a much greater recognition and prosperity
        overseas. There are various reasons which contribute to nil
        growth in any particular regoin in the world, but the most
        lamentable is when a country or region ignores its own
        potential. Only of late, (perhaps as late as the last few years
        - and this probably because of media scrutiny and attention) has
        this shameful trend begun its reversal in New Zealand. I say
        "begun" because it is barely noticeable. Let New Zealand only
        hope it has not regressed too far before it can catch up with
        its overseas cousins is this regard. In my own situation, well
        in excess of a ball-park 95% of the recognition I have enjoyed
        from my work has come from international quarters, that being
        from the United Kingdom, USA, Hong Kong, Japan, Sri Lanka,
        Australia, Canada, Russio, Sweden and Austra and I have not to
        this day placed myself on the internet - yet!"1 </p>
      <p>The universal pace for economical and, more important, clean,
        pollution free energy has seen the passing of laws in California
        USA requiring that ten percent of all cars sold, starting in the
        year 2003, be zero emission vehicles. Other American States have
        followed suit, creating a potential market for fuel free
        automation. The race has well and truly begun in the new energy
        arena with the burgeoning European and Asian laboratories
        following the lead and turning their attentions from the
        purification of fossil fuels to the interrogation of alternative
        energy sources. </p>
      <p>The electrical machine technology, developed in New Zealand by
        Dr. Adams of Aethmogen Technologies, in its various invented
        forms, is ideally suited to application in rural areas where
        there are expensive line charges for power supply, or no power
        access at all, as in remote locations. </p>
      <p>The system can also be adapted to the provision of steam power
        with which to run turbines, steam central heating systems in
        homes, business complexes, industrial plants, hospitals, hotels,
        airports, etc. </p>
      <p>The system is adaptable to all motive power requirements, i.e.,
        from marine applications right on through to agricultural,
        horticultural, fisheries, forestry, major earthworks,
        aeronautical and aerospace projects. Its applications are
        widespread, land, sea and air. </p>
      <p><i>For Greater Marine Safety</i> </p>
      <p>A boon to all boat owners and operators, whether their craft be
        dinghys, launches, yachts, tri-marans, luxury or ocean liner
        vessels, clean safe energy supply is now available for motive
        power, power for heating water, with additional supply for
        cooking, lighting and general heating purposes on board. The
        dangers and risks associated with using on board fuel and gas
        can now be totally eliminated. This clean power of the future is
        safe (no risk) and does not subject the environment to any
        interference whatsoever. It also has the unprecendented
        advantage of an as yet unprocured economical dominance over all
        other power alternatives. </p>
      <p>Quotation - from Dr. Harold Aspden PhD, BSc, FIEE, FIMech E,
        MInst P, C. Eng, C.Phys. Department of Electrical Engineering,
        University of Southampton, England: </p>
      <p>"...there seems no reason why the Adams motor cannot be
        developed rapidly for general use." (1994 - 1996). </p>
      <p>Since Dr. Aspden undertook his evaluation of the Adams
        technology and came to the above conclusion, the development of
        three different machine types have been completed and are now
        ready for aesthetic design formats to be considered with
        consequent construction for production purposes to follow. </p>

        <center><b><font size="+1">Introduction into Applied Aether
              Energy Science</font></b></center>
      </div>
      <p><br>
        With the advent of harnessing aetheric energy with the applied
        Adams Technologies, it poses a difficult task to know the best
        possible starting point with which to describe this almost as
        yet virtually unknown technology in the mainstream of electrical
        sciences. </p>
      <div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; <br>
        The decision I have taken is to commence at the grass roots, so
        to speak.</div>
      <p><br>
        It all started during 1969 when I first determined to use
        permanent magnets to construct an electric motor generator that
        would defy Lenz's law and, in so doing, invent an electrical
        machine that would run at unity and, so too, in turn, defy
        certain other orthodox laws. </p>
      <p>Before going on further, I feel you should all be aware of the
        reason why I decided to turn my attentions to developing a
        device which would display characteristics that would serve to
        exhibit that there were better ways of acheiving access to power
        or energy without recourse to man-made laws. I had long ago
        decided that ultimately all man-made laws required
        re-examination at one time or another and could never remain
        static in time - as time itself has constantly proved. Man-made
        laws, in particular those of physics and the allied sciences,
        have no path to follow, in that they tend to remain finite and
        exhibit the distinct inability to contain the characteristic of
        flexibility, which they must contain if they are to grow and
        expand at all, let alone grow and expand at the same pace of the
        human mind. Had the human mind taken upon itself the identity
        and stoliditude of these man-made Laws, the human condition
        would be a sad and sorry one today. Long enough had man
        subjected himself to the time-weary stagnant laws of physics and
        the electrical sciences and it seemed to me that in order for
        real progress to be made in this field, someone had to be brazen
        enough to stomach the inevitable sticks and stones and forge
        onwards to a totally new mentation. I had followed, throughout
        my many years of experience and constant studies, the works of
        other pioneers in other countries who had been theorising (more
        than experimenting in a practical sense) new ideas and
        hypotheses and it occured to me over and again that these
        scientists and inventors were trying to equate these new ideas
        with endless reams of unsuccessful calculations and equations
        based on the sacrosanct (and aging) man-made electrical and
        associated laws. I made up my mind that this was going to
        change, and change dramatically, if I was going to have anything
        to do with it. Many of these new pioneers, I felt, were (and
        are, even to this very day) trying to put new ideas up against
        old (and unfortunately still reigning) regimes and methods,
        which came into vogue long before the days of the great Leonardo
        da Vinci. </p>
      <div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; <br>
        And so I started quietly to work according to the Laws of the
        Universe and Nature and along the way over the years I made some
        rather astonishing discoveries of my own which, at times, bowled
        me quite over, and still do. As time went on, empirical findings
        made me bold enough to come out of my shell and go public with
        my results of experimentation and discoveries - quietly at
        first. This was both good and bad for me and I was eventually
        forced to anticipate and indeed prepare myself for the onslaught
        to come. Come it did - of course!</div>
      <p><br>
        What I was doing was an affront to every respectable teaching
        institution on the surface of the planet. Scores of electrical
        engineers and physicists bombarded me ad nauseum with the dogma,
        for instance, that, with my devices, I would get absolutely
        nowhere without closing the loop. At lectures this was one of
        the greater thorns in the sides of my contemporaries. Very few
        indeed were those attendees who gave this matter any in-depth
        thought at all, and those who did (brush away the cobwebs), as I
        lectured on, slowly nodded, quietly smiled and shouted no more
        (in the way people do when suddenly visited by an affliction of
        the dropped penny syndrome) ; they just listened with greater
        intensity and keen interest until the end of the lecture, when
        stunned murmering grew rapidly to an ever increasing buzz of
        heated dissertation and debate which, incidentally, rang through
        the lecture chambers long after I had departed. Such lectures,
        especially those (most) which were accompanied by at least an
        hour and more of question and answer sessions between the
        attendees and myself, were always a great joy for myself and I
        can say, with more than a little satisfaction, never boring for
        the attendees. </p>
      <p>So it is for all my readers today to understand that, although
        the walk has been long, thorny and arduous at times, the journey
        has been one of the utmost intrigue, fulfillment and discovery
        wherein I have experienced many surprises myself. Red rags have
        turned to green lights, frustration to reward and, in the end,
        all quite good fun. </p>
      <div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; <br>
        I describe matters now pertaining to calorimeters because, as we
        progress, it is found that they are vital instruments for this
        technology - so much so that I purport them to be the only
        accurate means of measuring power generated/harnessed within
        these devices of the Adams technologies. This fact, came to be
        because of the great difficulty in having to engage in applying
        empirical knowledge to working with this technology, as orthodox
        theories/methods are of no value whatsoever in the design and
        construction or testing of these super machines.</div>
      <p><br>
        Late 1995 - 1996 heralded in the successful and sophisticated
        "Adams Thermo-Motor Generator" entering the kilowatt range at
        greater power and performance. In addition during that period
        many various types of calorimeters were also designed and built
        by myself. Experience, intuition and empirical knowledge has
        since led to new discoveries and more sophisticated and accurate
        calorimeters. </p>
      <div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; <br>
        One special unit I will mention, but briefly, as it is on the
        classified file, is the Equilibrium Calorimeter. Now if equal
        masses of copper and water are heated, for instance, over flame,
        for equal periods of time, the temperature of the copper rises
        ten times as fast as the temperature of the water, and to cause
        the same temperature change of the water, it would have to be
        heated ten times as long. This massive variance, in addition to
        other factors to be accounted for, results in the necessity of
        tedious calculations which all have their resultant and
        inevitable error factors.</div>
      These complex ramifications of coefficients, specific heat,
      thermal conductivity, convection, radiation, absorption,
      insulation losses, have, ad infinitum, in their path of time
      immemorial, created ongoing contention to this day.
      <p>To put the matter to rest for my own sake, I turned to
        inventing a water calorimeter that would dispense with
        'calculations' and need only to rely on 'measurements'.
        (Measurements can be relied upon; calculations, in calorimetry
        involving water, can not!). This is, then, the Equilibrium
        Calorimeter mentioned above. </p>
      <p>In this type of water calorimeter, a small quantity of water
        and a short operation time is of paramount importance. The unit
        itself is unique in that its load heating element heats both the
        water and copper vessel simultaneously and as the machine being
        tested operates in the kilowatt range, a state of equilibrium in
        the calorimeter is very rapidly reached after switch on of the
        machine, and remains so to boiling point or any desired
        temperature. The copper vessel containes only 0.5 litre of water
        with a boiling point time of 2.0 minutes. The fact that all
        componentry and water reaches equilibrium so rapidly, ensures
        that the resultant accuracy and performance of the unit is such
        that insulation loss is so low for such a minimal period of
        time, it is negligible and can therefore be dismissed. The end
        result of this calorimeter invention procludes all doubtful
        calculations and therefore requires but three measurements only
        to be taken - those of mass, temperature and time - all of
        which, with the application of modern measuring methods, are
        extremely accurate, resulting in an overall maximisation of
        machine/device 'zero point' performance measurement, possibly
        never before attained. </p>

        <center><b><font size="+1">On The Phenomena of Wattless
              (Currentless) Power</font></b></center>
      </div>
      <p><br>
        Extensive variations of current are possible and are, to say the
        least, of considerable proportions - upwards and beyond some
        70%&gt;. As stated previously, in my recent papers, I am
        confident that the current can be still further reduced. </p>
      <div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; <br>
        The figures indicated at the end of this chapter show clearly
        that there is an anomaly which appears to defy a conclusive
        explanation of where the missing current (according to Ohms Law)
        has departed to! In reality, due to the subliminal velocity of
        the aetheric energy gaseous flow over the surface of the
        windings, the current becomes "lost" and, therefore, left
        behind.</div>
      <p><br>
        In 1976 I discovered the machine delivers massive heat power to
        an external load upwards of 600%&gt; above input power, this
        power then does not register in the machine or in the line load
        and must therefore be calorimetrically measured. This power is
        known as "wattless/currentless power". </p>
      <p>To understand this phenomenon, one must be conversant with
        "Tesla Aether Energy Science". Current-less power was described
        by Tesla in 1889 in his radiant energy transformers, but he
        never got around to putting it to practical use. It is to be
        noted, at this point, that I am the original discoverer of the
        phenomena of currentless power in the "Adams" motor generator. </p>
      <p>I quote herein by Gerry Vassilatoss in his 'Secrets of Cold War
        Technology' published by Borderlands Sciences Research
        Foundation, P.O. Box 220, Bayside C.A. 95524 U.S.A. 1996, (page
        38 paragraph 2): </p>
      <p>"<i>The Fractionation of Electric Currents</i> ~ Voltage pulses
        traversed the secondary surface like a gas pulse under
        increasing constriction. Until reaching the free end of coil,
        these gaseous pulses flowed over the copper surface rather than
        through it. Tesla referred to this specific manifestation as
        'the skin effect'. In this the discharge greatly resembled the
        manner of gasses in motion over surfaces." </p>
      <p>It is impossible to comprehend this 'Tesla Technology' without
        considerable knowledge of the Aether. One must seek out and
        study the proofs, of which there are now many, that have been
        established by experimenters worldwide. It is a technology
        capable of being explained through gas dynamic analogues. The
        fact that even partial elimination of electrons from Aether
        currents takes place, indeed spells out that this is a new kind
        of electricity which could find no resolution in present
        electrical science. This new energy technology is going to
        change the world we live in on an immense scale. </p>
      <p>To understand Tesla Aetheric Forces Technology, one must
        eliminate the notion that electrons are the working gremlins of
        electrostatic energies, for in this technology they are no
        longer the working gremlins. We are considering here an entirely
        different kind of electricity, endowed with totally different
        characteristics which, therefore, requires a new and different
        approach to the method of measuring the performance of any
        devices created as a result of the development of this
        technology, as the disparity between the two is immense. </p>
      <p>An Adams D.C. Impulse Electric Motor can be designed in such a
        way that the succession of charge and discharge impulses develop
        energy of such magnitude that it may be possible to have control
        of the flow of conventional electricity electrons through the
        complex metallic lattice of the very long length of wire used in
        the stator system, due to its super luminal velocity, of which
        the gaseous pulse flows over the coil surface. This then would
        provide us with an electric motor that requires very little
        current at nominal voltage whilst yet delivering considerable
        power. </p>
      <p>There are certain parameters required to be implemented which
        do not apply to conventional D.C. electric motors - those of
        repulsive impulsing operating potential, stator winding
        resistances, winding wire size and quantity and machine
        construction materials, etc. The established gaseous
        electrostatic electricity moves over the surface of the
        winding's wire at a super luminal velocity. This creates an
        enormous surge leaving the slower moving electrons behind and,
        hence, a consequent reduction in current flow is possible,
        according to machine parameter variables applied. </p>

      </div>
      <p><br>
        In considering the above we should first look at the question of
        "how is electrical energy generated?" To begin with we must
        dispose of the myth that electromagnetic machines generate
        electrical energy as is taught in our schools and universities
        by the establishment. So called "electric generators" do not
        generate electric power per se. They are mechanical devices
        which, due to their rotational field, act as a gating mechanism,
        tapping the aetheric energy field within the air gap between the
        machine stator and rotor, and delivering that energy externally
        in the form known to us as 'electrical energy'. This energy is
        ever present (omnipresent, as previously explained) but the
        machine must be in motion to harness it, not generate it. </p>
      <div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; <br>
        NOTE: In the interests of simplicity for the reader , however, I
        will continue, in this paper, to use the words
        "generate/generated/generator" as the words are used in their
        normal and general context.</div>
      <p><br>
        In electric motors we have the interesting situation whereby we
        apply stored, or 'generated' electric power to supply motive
        force to do mechanical work. The motor is, however, also reliant
        on aetheric energy from the air gap of the device for rotational
        power. </p>
      <p>From the foregoing, it is clearly evident that if the AETHER
        did not exist, as the establishment and Newtonians would have us
        believe, then there would be no aetheric force and, therefore,
        no manner of electric motor or generator would function, as
        there would, in turn, be no action at a distance, no lines of
        force, no magnetic fields and hence no Universe! </p>

        <center><b><font size="+1">Translocating Potential Gradient to
              the Motor</font></b></center>
      </div>
      <p><br>
        On translocating potential gradient to the charged mass in a
        circuit element and sourcing it via impulse to the motor, will
        amplify the inherent magnetic unified charged mass and, for a
        finite time, retard, or very nearly block off electron flow,
        thus precluding current flow; this is termed the relaxation time
        of the mass of the circuit element, i.e., in this case, the
        motor stators including windings. There are at least two
        possible methods of causing a finite delay time thereby
        retarding current flow within the stator element, in addition to
        impulsing the source - one, of using doped winding wire (at
        present a difficult one) and - two, in designing the stator/s by
        incorporating sacred geometry, i.e., PI and PHI involving the
        Golden Ratio. </p>
      <div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; <br>
        The collector element will then become a secondary battery being
        used in a conventional manner to power a load, which does not
        affect the primary source. This power so provided in the
        external load is free and sourced in such a way that the prime
        mover source is not being brutalised as where, in conventional
        motors, they are designed to do just that and are, in turn,
        themselves brutalised with resultant high temperature and
        extremely poor performance. Bluntly, their role is that of
        destroying their own source of potential gradient and eventually
        destroying themselves.</div>
      There is massive trapped energy in many natural materials,
      especially metals. Latent magnetic energy is ever present in these
      materials and this energy I describe within the structures of
      electric motors is found to play an important role together with
      that of the energy harnessed from the small air gap between the
      rotor and stator sections; this applies to both motors and
      generators alike.
      <p>Power source applied to electric motors expands the ever
        present covert electromagnetic flux of the metal materials,
        i.e., the iron core and copper windings. It is not the impressed
        energy applied to the motor that creates the inductive field, as
        taught in universities and colleges alike; the magnetic flux
        field "already" exists in its natural state within the stator
        system; the application of energy into the system simply
        "expands" the natural latent inherent inductive energy residing
        therein. </p>
      <p>This expanded inductive energy, in conjunction with the energy
        harnessed at the air gap between the rotor and stators, provides
        the driving power of the motor. The important roles played by
        these two sources of force have "never before" been properly
        highlighted. They have eluded mainstream academia and scientists
        alike for over a "century" in regard to their vital importance
        in machine design and this explains "why" electric motors have
        "never" been improved upon during these past 100 odd years. </p>
      <p>The role played by these two forces require "more investigation
        and understanding" in the part they play in magnetism and
        inductance as applied to electric motors. The design parameters
        concerning these two forces far outweigh the importance of I²R
        losses. </p>
      <p>It is incredible indeed to realise that electrical engineers
        and scientists in this modern age of technology are still taught
        to use free trapped electromagnetic energy to destroy the source
        of the said energy, by placing these flintstone motors across
        the National Grid Systems and/or battery energy sources. In this
        brutal way, millions of megawatts of energy is wasted daily
        throughout the world in the manner described above and there is
        no excuse for allowing such a monstrous waste to persist any
        longer. Every fossil fuelled and nuclear power station in the
        world could be shut down in the space of three years. </p>

        There is a problem with the above definitions, but that is not
        the fault of people like ourselves in the New Energy field - it

        I do not subscribe to the definitions of "over 100% EFF" or
        "beyond unity". There can be no "beyond unity" as the totality

        The definitions of "over unity", "beyond unity", etc., are so
        much in use in present day New Energy Science that in some of my

        as the task of de-programming our thinking on the matter is
        still very much in its embryonic state. In this updated version
        of my writings I have made more of an effort to break the mould
        of using such terminology as to continuing to do so can only
        retard any progress and confuse the reader and young student. </p>

      <p><br>
        Since it is proven that the Adams Technologies, as applied to
        the Adams Electric Motor Generator inventions, violate OHMS LAW,
        the use of conventional instrumentation and of OHMS LAW itself,
        for evaluation of performance, results in gross errors.&nbsp;
        The heart of the problem here, lies in the fact that standard
        electricity, as we know it, is a totally different kind of
        energy to that which is directly gated from the aether, the
        nature of this energy being such that it does not respond to
        conventional electrical instrumentation, nor does it obey OHMS
        LAW.&nbsp; This orthodox instrumentation is found to be grossly
        in error, just as is the application of OHMS LAW itself for
        power measurement, simply because the basic design of the said
        instrumentation used INVOLVES OHMS LAW! </p>
      <div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; <br>
        This then heralds in the need of an ocean of new electrical
        scientific teachings, in order to accommodate these new
        technologies into electrical engineering texts for colleges and
        universities.
        <p>Firstly, a NEW MENTATION must take place, where teachers and
          students alike will need to de-programme their present
          knowledge of conventional electricity to that of electricity
          harnessed from the aether. It is time NOW for our future young
          student scientists and electrical and electronic engineers to
          study this vast new clean and inexhaustible source of energy
          along with its massive implications and applications.</p>
      </div>
      <p><br>
        This discovery of the VIOLATION OF OHMS LAW is monumental and
        unprecedented, but also goes further in that it renders all
        conventional digital and analogue instruments as obsolete tools
        for use in this new technology.&nbsp; Instrument manufacturers
        worldwide will also require to re-programme their mentation in
        order to enter this new dimension of technology and proceed to
        formulate new instrumentation with which to take the place of
        their predecessors.&nbsp; This will pose a difficult task, as
        the Adams Technologies have violated other so-called LAWS of
        science. </p>
      <p>It is on account of the aforegoing ambiguous circumstances that
        I resorted to calorimetry for measuring input and output power,
        in doing so, dispensed with the need for any of the unreliable
        instrumentation or OHMS LAW itself and thus, too, as an aside,
        relegating obscurantism back into the realm of darkness from
        whence it came, since measurements made in the science of
        calorimetry are indisputable.&nbsp; Realistically, since
        calorimetric measurements have been proven to be the only
        accurate and reliable means of proving unity and power
        measurement, then orthodox electrical instrumentation has become
        dispensible in this new era of technology. </p>
      <p>The question then arises, as it inevitable must as a natural
        consequence of the problem, "Do we need new instrumentation at
        all?", in view of the probability existing that any new design
        structure of such new instrumentation could create some rather
        insurmountable obstacles not encountered with the use of
        calorimetry. </p>

        <center><b><font size="+1">Input Power Measurement &amp; Its
              Significance in the Adams Technologies</font></b></center>
      </div>
      <p><br>
        In relation to the measuring of input power to the Adams motor
        generator, where the question of differentiating between the
        heat produced by the motor section and the heat produced by the
        generator section, particularly where the motor generator is one
        integral unit, there poses a controversial situation of "how
        best to calculate the measurement" if the measurement "is
        determined calorimetrically"? </p>
      <div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; <br>
        In reality, it is irrelevant to measure the quantities of heat
        of either sections in any case.</div>
      <p><br>
        I made the decision some years ago to abandon trying to
        differentiate between the two measurements and, in so doing, put
        an end to the unnecessary laborious hours spent in complex
        calculations by measuring total heat power and to simply
        consider any heat energy not harnessed as an additional loss
        together with other normal losses. </p>
      <p>This is entirely acceptable for the very reason that "all"
        losses are of no consequence whatsoever in this technology, as
        the machine in question is operating in the dimension commonly
        known and referred to in scientific circles as "Zero Point",
        i.e., energy generation being "infinite" with power
        incrementally increasing with time, as the calorimetric graph
        indicates. [Ed - unprinted on web] </p>
      <p>I refer the reader, at this point, to an internationally
        recognised scientist in applied aetheric energy technologies,
        one Dr. Peter Lindemann of the USA, who quotes to me in
        correspondence of October 16 1999 :- </p>
      <p>"Thank you for the package of your latest writing. In my humble
        opinion, it is the best material I have seen to date. Your
        documentation on the violation of Ohms Law is monumental!
        Congratulations. Also, your eloquent defense of yourself and
        others in the field is masterful. Spoken as the real leader you
        are. </p>
      <p>Now that you know, with confidence, that Ohms Law only operates
        within a narrow window, and that once outside this window, it
        begins to fail as a useful method to calculate accurately, the
        behaviour of certain equipment, such as your machines, surely
        you can now better appreciate what I have stated in the past,
        that we do not know what the real equivalences are between
        electrical work as Watt-Hours, heat work as BTUs, and mechanical
        work as Foot-Pounds. If we really do not know what the
        equivalences are, then we cannot calculate conversions between
        these units of measure! I really do not know how to make this
        point more emphatically!" </p>
      <p>And, in further correspondence , he quotes :- </p>
      <p>"There is also another way of looking at the 'efficiency' of
        your machine. Your machine recovers all of the electrical input.
        Then, it also produces mechanical energy and heat energy. Since
        no mechanical work or heat is put into the machine, these
        outputs represent and INFINITE PERCENTAGE GAIN over the zero
        amounts put in......more than enough to irrefutably crush
        conventional explanations! Absolutely spectacular! You are
        liberating real work from the aether! </p>
      <p>Since we really don't know the 'equivalent' values of
        electrical mechanical heat in real units, it seems best to
        measure inputs and outputs for each energy manifestation
        separately. In this way, your machine shines like a beacon
        toward a new horrizon. It also begs the question - 'Since your
        are getting all of the electricity you put in back out, where
        does the heat and mechanical energy come from?' This way of
        looking at it shatters any hope of finding an explanation within
        the 'conversion' or 'efficiency' ideas of the 'First Law of
        Thermodynamics'. The real efficiency of your machine is UNKNOWN
        because it proves that nothing is being converted into anything
        else. Energy affects are simply APPEARING FROM 'the aether',
        'nowhere', 'counter space'. 'the Zero Point' ... you name it.
        The truth is, we still don't know how best to do it. </p>
      <p>What we can measure is: Voltage (potential difference) ~
        Temperature (thermal difference)&nbsp; ~ Mass (weight or atomic
        volume) ~ Distance (length) ~ Time (duration). </p>
      <p>The cross product between temperature and mass gives us WORK
        units of Calories or BTUs. The cross product of distance and
        mass gives us WORK units of Foot-Pounds or Dyne-Centimeters,
        which can also be expressed as Joules. (1 Joule = 0.7375
        foot-pounds = 107 Dyne-Centimeters). Watts are defined as a
        "Joule per second" or as volts times amperes. This makes a Joule
        also equal to a Watt-Second by definition. But since "current"
        and "resistance" are generated by calculation according to Ohm's
        Law, the Watt-Second cannot be measured as a unit of electrical
        work, it can only be measured as a unit of mechanical work.
        Without Ohm's Law, there is no way to determine WORK in
        electrical machinery, unless you resort to Calorimetry. Then and
        only then, can you measure things again, and get away from
        calculating. This is what you are already doing, which is
        exactly correct!" (Peter A. Lindemann, Borderland Sciences

      <p><br>
        This device is a super power, thermo, impulse, salient pole,
        open magnetic circuit, repulsion, self-starting, reluctance
        electric motor generator. The "Adams Triplex Aetheric Energy
        Motor Generator" is so named in view of its unorthodox and
        unusual ability to manifest considerable aetheric energy from
        three different areas of the machine. </p>
      <div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; <br>
        The stator system, with its ability to reach high temperatures
        very rapidly, is designed to harness this heat from the cores of
        the stators via water circulation. The second source of energy
        is derived from loading the machine as a generator.</div>
      <p><br>
        Temperature, material types and geometric secrets which govern
        the high output power and performance of the Adams Thermo-motor
        Generator. </p>
      <p>This is a super power machine, the first of its kind in the
        world, with the capability of manifesting massive heat power
        internally in such a way that it precludes any damage due to
        heat affecting the rare earth magnets in its rotor system. The
        rotor is designed and engineered in such a way that it gates
        massive aetheric energy in the form of heat which is transferred
        by the rotor system to the water jacket system of the machine
        stators. The machine rotor carries out this operation whilst
        itself remaining relatively cool - at most, a few degrees above
        ambient - whilst the heat which is manifested on load is capable
        of reaching into hundreds of degrees and kilowatts of power. On
        account of the foregoing mastered conditions of temperature
        control and transfer of manifested power to the stator water
        jacket system, the life span of the rare earth magnets remains
        unchanged, i.e., no deterioration takes place. The rotor of this
        super power machine was invented late 1995 and perfected into a
        machine in early 1996. </p>
      <p>In comparison to an orthodox machine constructed of standard
        materials, this machine consists of different materials in its
        make-up of construction, the materials of which are of specific
        geometric dimensions, mass, etc., and so placed geometrically
        inside the rotor as to gate the awesome aetheric power that is
        inherrent in the 1.25mm air gap of the machine and to deliver
        it, in the form of heat and/or electric power, to a load. </p>
      <p>There are three sources of heat energy manifested in the Adams
        Thermo-motor Generator version and all three are physically
        isolated from each other. These three heat sources appear at :-
      </p>
      <p>The Thermo-motor Generator, (whereby heat is transferred via
        water through pipes to a seperate calorimeter) ; </p>
      <p>The Machine Mosfet Calorimeter, (heated by energy manifesting
        at the mosfet) and - </p>
      <p>The machine Load Equilibrium Calorimeter (heated by the
        electrical loading of the machine). </p>
      <p>The machine Load Equilibrium Calorimeter is the vital measuring
        instrument in the line-up, as it MEASURES the output power of
        the machine proper. The other two heat manifestations are by no
        means small and are free spin offs which can be readily
        harnessed. </p>
      <div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; <br>
        The Adams Aetheric Energy Electric Motor-Generator Technologies,
        over the past ten years, have heralded in new innovations that
        have culminated in very significant discoveries including that
        of the use of certain materials not normally used in the
        construction of orthodox electrical machines, resulting in the
        manifestation of massive power, in the form of heat, from the
        Thermo-motor-generator designs, at undreamed of ratios of input
        power to output power.</div>
      <p><br>
        There are now "proven" natural laws pertaining to energy which
        render the orthodox "assumptions" of the establishment down to
        the realms of the obsolete and, however troublesome to accept,
        include those contained in the hypotheses traditionally served
        at the banquet hall tables seated by Einstein's Relativity,
        Quantum Mechanics, The Laws of Thermodynamics, Lenz's Law, Ohms
        Law and others. The truth of the entire situation is that I,
        Robert G. Adams, have proved, over hundreds and thousands of
        hours hard labour at the laboratory benches and machine shops,
        with the aid of intuition and empirical knowledge, that these
        aetheric energies are manifesting at unity/zero point and
        whereby the bottom line is that there is no longer any reference
        point from which to base any kind of so-called "efficiency"
        test. So the word "efficiency", with regard to aetheric energies
        simply cannot possibly apply because the only way by which to
        calculate the "efficiency" of the omnipresent would be to draw
        up scales of astronomical mathematical proportions that such
        scales would ultimately become eternal and infinite, and totally
        impossible to monitor, police or keep track of. Utterly beyond
        the ability of mankind. And so the term "efficiency" cannot ever
        be applied to "aetheric energy ", or, for that matter, the
        technology/ies invented or created by which mankind may have the
        capability to gate or harness it. And so the term "efficiency",
        here in the case of aetheric energies, becomes a nonentity
        forever and a day, and I hereby lay claim to the original
        discovery and, indeed, acknowledgement of this "Law of Nature"
        and hereby designate this discovery "The Adams Law". The 'Adams
        Law' also encompasses many other discoveries I have made
        pertaining to Ohms Law, Lenz's Law, etc. </p>
      <p>The seed of original doubt of the explanations given me from my
        peers in relation to magnetism, electromagnetism, inductance,
        magnetic radiation - became apparent to me at the age of nine
        years and, for some reason convinced me that there was something
        unaccounted for. Hence, as aforementioned, as time progressed, I
        made up my mind that a change had to come about and that
        sacrosanct orthodoxy had to be the victim of that change. Yes,
        difficult as it would have been for the Ceasars to comprehend,
        let alone possibly accept, even the mighty Rome had to fall -
        one day. </p>

        open magnetic circuit, repulsion, self-starting, reluctance
        electric motor generator. The "Adams Triplex Aetheric Energy
        Motor Generator" is so named in view of its unorthodox and
        unusual ability to manifest considerable aetheric energy from

      <p>The stator system, with its ability to reach high temperatures
        very rapidly, is designed to harness this heat from the cores of
        the stators via water circulation. The second source of energy
        is derived from loading the machine as a generator. </p>
      <div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; <br>
        The heat in the stator system is present whether the machine is
        run in a no-load or loaded condition. When loaded, however, the
        heat in the stator system increases rapidly and "continues" to
        do so during the period of operation.</div>
      <p><br>
        A further and third source of aetheric heat energy is manifested
        at the mosfet. This heat is also harnessed by the heating of
        water. This mosfet is set inside the copper storage vessel (or
        calorimeter) for measurement purposes. </p>
      <p>The total heat from all three sources can reach upwards of
        eight (8) times the input/heat power. </p>
      <p>A unique method of successfully transferring the heat from the
        stator system is water circulation within the stator cores and,
        as the stators are water cooled, it provides protection for the
        windings from burning out ; this is of paramount importance
        because as the machine is running "at unity" the heat
        manifesting at the stators "continues" to rise with time. The
        water so heated is circulated with the aid of an electronic pump
        which transports it to a holding tank/calorimeter for
        measurement purposes. </p>
      <p>In addition to the unique structure of the stator system, is
        that of the rotor. The rotor was invented and perfected during
        1996. Its materials, in addition to the magnets and the
        dimensions and geometrical placements of the said materials, are
        vital to the massive manifestation of heat that results from its
        structure and that of the stator system and its technological
        parameters. The rotor, however, playing the major role, remains
        the coolest part of the machine. </p>
      <p>This machine is revolutionary and the first of its kind in the
        world and provides economical clean safe power. In an actual
        domestic application installation the machine would, of course,
        have a common holding hot water cylinder which would receive all
        three sources of the aetheric heat energies manifest within the
        machine componentry. </p>

      <p><b>Abstract -- </b>An electrodynamic motor-generator has a
        salient pole permanent magnet rotor interacting with salient
        stator poies to form a machine operating on the magnetic
        reluctance principle. The intrinsic ferromagnetic power of the
        magnets provides the drive torque by bringing the poles into
        register whilst current pulses demagnetize the stator poles as
        the poles separate. In as much as less power is needed for
        stator demagnetization than is fed into the reluctance drive by
        the thermodynamic system powering the ferromagnetic state, the
        machine operates regeneratively by virtue of stator winding
        interconnection with unequal number of rotor and stator poles. A
        rotor construction is disclosed (Fig 6, 7). The current pulse
        may be such as to cause replusion of the rotor poles. </p>
      <p><b>Field of Invention</b> </p>
      <p>This invention relates to a form of electric motor which serves
        a generating function in that the machine can act regeneratively
        to develop output electrical power or can generate mechanical
        drive torque with unusually high efficiency in relation to
        electrical power input. </p>
      <div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; <br>
        The field of invention is that of switched reluctance motors,
        meaning machines which have salient poles and operate by virtue
        of the mutual magnetic attraction and / or repulsion as between
        magnetized poles. The invention particularly concerns a form of
        reluctance motor which incorporates permanent magnets to
        establish magnetic polarization.</div>
      <p><br>
        <b>Background of the Invention</b> </p>
      <p>There have been proposals in the past for machines in which the
        relative motion of magnets can in some way develop unusually
        strong force actions which are said to result in more power
        output than is supplied as electrical input. </p>
      <div style="text-align: left;">By orthodox electrical engineering
        principles such suggestions have seemed to contradict accepted
        principles of physics, but it is becoming increasingly evident
        that conformity with the first law of thermodynamics allows a
        gain in the electromechanical power balance provided it is
        matched by a thermal cooling.</div>
      In this sense, one needs to extend the physical background of the
      cooling medium to include, not just the machine structure and the
      immediate ambient environment, but also the sub-quantum level of
      what is termed, in modern physics, the zero-point field. This is
      the field associated with the Planck constant. Energy is
      constantly being exchanged as between that activity and
      coextensive matter forms but normally these energy fluctuations
      preserve, on balance, an equilibrium condition so that this action
      passes unnoticed at the technology level.
      <p>Physicists are becoming more and more aware of the fact that,
        as with gravitation, so magnetism is a route by which we can
        gain access to the sea of energy that pervades the vacuum.
        Historically, the energy balance has been written in
        mathematical terms by assigning 'negative' potential to
        gravitation or magnetism. However, this is only a disguised way
        of saying that the vacuum field, suitably influenced by the
        gravitating mass of a body in the locality or by magnetism in a
        ferromagnet has both the capacity and an urge to shed energy. </p>
      <p>Now, however, there is growing awareness of the technological
        energy generating potential of this field background and
        interest is developing in techniques for 'pumping' the coupling
        between matter and vacuum field to derive power from that hidden
        energy source. Such research may establish that this action will
        draw on the 2. 7K cosmic background temperature of the space
        medium through which the Earth travels at some 400 km/s. The
        effect contemplated could well leave a cool vapour trail' in
        space as a machine delivering heat, or delivering a more useful
        electrical form of energy that will revert to heat, travels with
        body Earth through that space. </p>
      <p>In pure physics terms, relevant background is of recent record
        in the August 1993 issue of <i>Physical Review E</i>, vol. 48,
        pp. 1562-1565 under the title: 'Extracting energy and heat from
        the vacuum', authored by D.C. Cole and H. E. Puthoff. Though the
        connection is not referenced in that paper, one of its author's
        presented experimental evidence on that theme at an April 1993
        conference held in Denver USA. The plasma power generating
        device discussed at that conference was the subject of U. S.
        Patent No. 5,018,180, the inventor of record being K. R.
        Shoulders. </p>
      <p>The invention, to be described below, operates by extracting
        energy from a magnetic system in a motor and the relevant
        scientific background to this technology can be appreciated from
        the teachings of E.B. Moullin, a Cambridge Professor of
        Electrical Engineering who was a President of the Institution of
        Electrical Engineers in UK. </p>
      <p>That prior art will be described below as part of the
        explanation of the operation of the invention. </p>
      <p>The invention presented here concerns specific structural
        design features of a machine adapted for robust operation, but
        these also have novelty and special merit in a functional
        operation. What is described is quite distinct from prior art
        proposals, one being a novel kind of motor proposed by Gareth
        Jones at a 1988 symposium held in Hull, Canada under the
        auspices of the Planetary Association for Clean Energy. Jones
        suggested the adaptation of an automobile alternator which
        generates three-phase a. c. for rectification and use as a power
        supply for the electrics in the automobile. This alternator has
        a permanent magnet rotor and Jones suggested that it could be
        used, with high efficiency gain and torque performance, by
        operating it as a motor with the three-phase winding circuit
        excited so as to promote strong repulsion between the magnet
        poles and the stator poles after the poles had come into
        register. However, the Jones machine is not one exploiting the
        advantages of the invention to be described, because it is not
        strictly a reluctance motor having salient poles on both stator
        and rotor. The stator poles in the Jones machine are formed by
        the winding configuration in a slotted stator form, the many
        slots being uniformly distributed around the inner circumference
        of the stator and not constituting a pole system which lends
        itself to the magnetic flux actions to be described by reference
        to the E.B. Moullin experiment. </p>
      <p>The Jones machine operates by generating a rotating stator
        field which, in a sense, pushes the rotor poles forward rather
        than pulling them in the manner seen in the normal synchronous
        motor. Accordingly, the Jones machine relies on the electric
        current excitation of the motor producing a field system which
        rotates smoothly but has a polarity pattern which is forced by
        the commutation control to keep behind the rotor poles in
        asserting a continuous repulsive drive. </p>
      <p>Another prior art proposal which is distinguished from this
        invention is that of one of the applicants, H. Aspden, namely
        the subject of U.K. Patent No. 2,234,863 (counterpart U.S.
        Patent Serial No. (4,975,608). Although this latter invention is
        concerned with extracting energy from the field by the same
        physical process as the subject invention, the technique for
        accessing that energy is not optimum in respect of the structure
        or method used. Whereas in this earlier disclosure, the
        switching of the reluctance drive excited the poles in their
        approach phase, the subject invention, in one of its aspects,
        offers distinct advantages by demagnetization or reversal of
        magnetization in the pole separation phase of operation. </p>
      <p>There are unexpected advantages in the implementation proposed
        by the subject invention, inasmuch as recent research has
        confirmed that it requires less input power to switch off the
        mutual attraction across an air gap between a magnet and an
        electromagnet than it does to switch it on. Usually, in
        electromagnetism, a reversal symmetry is expected, arising from
        conventional teaching of the way forward and back magnetomotive
        forces govern the resulting flux in a magnetic circuit. This
        will be further explained after describing the scope of the
        invention. </p>
      <p><b>Brief Description of the Invention</b> </p>
      <p>According to one aspect of the invention, an electrodynamic
        motor-generator machine comprises a stator configured to provide
        a set of stator poles, a corresponding set of magnetizing
        windings mounted on the stator pole set, a rotor having two
        sections each of which has a set of salient pole pieces, the
        rotor sections being axially spaced along the axis of rotation
        of the rotor, rotor magnetization means disposed between the two
        rotor sections arranged to produce a unidirectional magnetic
        field which magnetically polarizes the rotor poles, whereby the
        pole faces of one rotor section all have a north polarity and
        the pole faces of the other rotor section all have a south
        polarity and electric circuit connections between an electric
        current source and the stator magnetizing windings arranged to
        regulate the operation of the machine by admitting current
        pulses for a duration determined according to the angular
        position of the rotor, which pulses have a direction tending to
        oppose the polarization induced in the stator by the rotor
        polarization as stator and rotor poles separate from an
        in-register position, whereby the action of the rotor
        magnetization means provides a reluctance motor drive force to
        bring stator and rotor poles into register and the action of the
        stator magnetization windings opposes the counterpart reluctance
        braking effect as the poles separate. </p>
      <p>According to a feature of the invention, the circuit connecting
        the electric current source and the stator magnetizing windings
        is designed to deliver current pulses which are of sufficient
        strength and duration to provide demagnetization of the stator
        poles as the stator and rotor poles separate from an in-register
        position.In this regard it is noted that in order to suppress
        the reluctance drive torque or brake torque, depending upon
        whether poles are converging or separating, a certain amount of
        electrical power must be fed to the magnetizing windings on the
        stator. In a sense these windings are really 'demagnetizing
        windings' because the polarity of the circuit connections admit
        the pulse current in the demagnetizing direction. However, it is
        more usual to refer to windings on magnetic cores as
        'magnetizing windings' even though they can function as primary
        windings or secondary windings, the former serving the
        magnetization function with input power and the latter serving a
        demagnetizing function with return of power. </p>
      <p>According to another feature of the invention, the circuit
        connecting the electric current source and the stator
        magnetizing windings is designed to deliver current pulses which
        are of sufficient strength and duration to provide a reversal of
        magnetic flux direction in the stator poles as the stator and
        rotor poles separate from an in-register position, whereby to
        draw on power supplied from the electric current source to
        provide additional forward drive torque. </p>
      <p>According to a further feature of this invention, the electric
        current source connected to stator magnetizing winding of a
        first stator pole comprises, at least partially, the electrical
        pulses induced in the stator magnetizing winding of a different
        second stator pole, the stator pole set configuration in
        relation to the rotor pole set configuration being such that the
        first stator pole is coming into register with a rotor pole as
        the second stator pole separates from its in register position
        with a rotor pole. </p>
      <p>This means that the magnetizing windings of two stator poles
        are connected so that both serve a 'demagnetizing' function, one
        in resisting the magnetic action of the mutual attraction in
        pulling poles into register, an action which develops a current
        pulse output and one in absorbing this current pulse, again by
        resisting the magnetic inter-pole action to demagnetize the
        stator pole as its associated rotor pole separates. </p>
      <p>In order to facilitate the function governed by this circuit 10
        connection between stator magnetizing windings, a phase
        difference is needed and this is introduced by designing the
        machine to have a different number of poles in a set of stator
        poles from the number of rotor poles in each rotor section.
        Together with the dual rotor section feature, this has the
        additional merit of assuring a smoother torque action and
        reducing magnetic flux fluctuations and leakage effects which
        contribute substantially to machine efficiency. </p>
      <p>Thus, according to another feature of the invention, the stator
        configuration provides pole pieces which are common to both
        rotor sections in the sense that when stator and rotor poles are
        in-register the stator pole pieces constitute bridging members
        for magnetic flux closure in a magnetic circuit including that
        of the rotor magnetization means disposed between the two rotor
        sections. </p>
      <p>Preferably, the number of poles in a set of stator poles and
        the number of rotor poles in each section do not share a common
        integer factor, the number of rotor poles in one rotor section
        is the same as that in the other rotor section and the number of
        poles in a stator set and the number of poles in a rotor section
        differs by one, with the pole faces According to a further
        feature of the invention, the electric current source connected
        to a stator magnetizing winding of a first stator pole
        comprises, at least partially, the electrical pulses induced in
        the stator magnetizing winding of a different second stator
        pole, the stator pole set configuration in relation to the rotor
        pole set configuration being such that the first stator pole is
        coming into register with a rotor pole as being of sufficient
        angular width to assure that the magnetic flux produced by the
        rotor magnetization means can find a circuital magnetic flux
        closure route through the bridging path of a stator pole and
        through corresponding rotor poles for any angular position of
        the rotor. </p>
      <p>It is also preferable from a design viewpoint for the stator
        pole faces of this invention to have an angular width that is no
        greater than half the angular width of a rotor pole and for the
        rotor sections to comprise circular steel laminations in which
        the rotor poles are formed as large teeth at the perimeter with
        the rotor magnetization means comprising a magnetic core
        structure the end faces of which abut two assemblies of such
        laminations forming the two rotor sections. </p>
      <p>According to a further feature of the invention, the rotor
        magnetization means comprises at least one permanent magnet
        located with its polarization axis parallel with the rotor axis.
        The motor-generator may include an apertured metal disc that is
        of a non-magnetizable substance mounted on a rotor shaft and
        positioned intermediate the two rotor sections, each aperture
        providing location for a permanent magnet, whereby the
        centrifugal forces acting on the permanent magnet as the rotor
        rotates are absorbed by the stresses set up in the disc. Also,
        the rotor may be mounted on a shaft that is of a
        non-magnetizable substance, whereby to minimize magnetic leakage
        from the rotor magnetizing means through that shaft. </p>
      <p>According to another aspect of the invention, an electrodynamic
        motor-generator machine comprises a stator configured to provide
        a set of stator poles, a corresponding set of magnetizing
        windings mounted on the stator pole set, a rotor having two
        sections each of which has a set of salient pole pieces, the
        rotor sections being axially spaced along the axis of rotation
        of the rotor, rotor magnetization means incorporated in the
        rotor structure and arranged to polarize the rotor poles,
        whereby the pole faces of one rotor section all have a north
        polarity and the pole faces of the other rotor section all have
        a south polarity and electric circuit connections between an
        electric current source and the stator magnetizing windings
        arranged to regulate the operation of the machine by admitting
        current pulses for a duration determined according to the
        angular position of the rotor, which pulses have a direction
        tending to oppose the polarization induced in the stator by the
        rotor polarization as stator and rotor poles separate from an
        in-register position, whereby the action of the rotor
        magnetization means provides a reluctance motor drive force to
        bring stator and rotor poles into register and the action of the
        stator magnetization windings opposes the counterpart reluctance
        braking effect as the poles separate. </p>
      <p>According to a feature of this latter aspect of the invention,
        the electric current source connected to a stator magnetizing
        winding of a first stator pole comprises, at least partially,
        the electrical pulses induced in the stator magnetizing winding
        of a different second stator pole, the stator pole set
        configuration in relation to the rotor pole set configuration
        being such that the first stator pole is coming into register
        with a rotor pole as the second stator pole separates from its
        in-register position with a rotor pole. </p>

        <b>Detailed Description of the Invention</b> </p>
      <div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; <br>
        The fact that one can extract energy from the source which
        powers the intrinsic ferromagnetic state is not explicitly
        evident from existing textbooks, but it is implicit and, indeed,
        does become explicit once pointed out, in one textbook authored
        by F. B. Moullin.</div>
      <p><br>
        His book <i>The Principles of Electromagnetism</i> published by
        Clarendon Press, Oxford (3rd Edition, 1955) describes on pages
        168-174 an experiment concerned with the effect of air gaps
        between poles in a magnetic circuit. The data obtained are
        reproduced in Fig. 1, where Professor Moullin shows a curve
        representing a. c. current input for different air gaps, given
        that the voltage supplied is constant. In the same figure,
        Moullin presents the theoretical current that would need to be
        applied to sustain the same voltage, and so the related pole
        forces across the air gap, assuming (a) no flux leakage and (b)
        that there is complete equality between inductive energy input
        and the mechanical energy potential for the magnetization that
        is established in the air gap in a quarter-cycle period at the
        a. c. power excitation frequency. </p>
      <p>The data show that, even though the level of magnetic
        polarization is well below the saturation value, being confined
        to a range that is regarded as the linear permeability range in
        transformer design, there is a clear drop-off of current, and so
        the volt-amp reactive power input needed, as current increases,
        compared with that predicted by the mechanical potential built
        up in the air gaps. </p>
      <p>Unless leakage flux is excessive, here was clear evidence of
        anomalous energy activity. </p>
      <p>Moullin discusses the leakage flux inferred by this experiment
        but points out that there is considerable mystery in why the
        effect of a small gap, which should certainly not result in much
        flux leakage in the gap region, nevertheless has an enormous
        effect in causing what has to be substantial leakage in the
        light of the energy discrepancy. </p>
      <p>Moullin did not contemplate that energy had been fed in from
        the zero-point field system and so he left the issue with the
        statement that it was virtually impossible to predict leakage
        flux by calculation. </p>
      <p>He was, of course, aware of magnetic domain structure and his
        argument was that the leakage flux problem was connected with
        what he termed a 'yawing' action of the flux as it passes around
        the magnetic circuit. Normally, provided the level of
        polarization is below the knee of the B-H curve, which occurs at
        about 70% of saturation in iron cores of general crystal
        composition, it requires very little magnetizing field to change
        the magnetic flux density. This is assuming that every effort is
        made to avoid air gaps. The action involves domain wall
        movements so that the magnetic states of adjacent domains switch
        to different crystal axes of easy magnetization and this
        involves very little energy change. </p>
      <p>However, if there is an air gap ahead in the flux circuit and
        the magnetizing winding is not sitting on that air gap, the iron
        core itself has to be the seat of a progressive field source
        linking the winding and the gap. It can only serve in that sense
        by virtue of the lines of flux in the domains being forced to
        rotate somewhat from the preferred easy axes of magnetization,
        with the help of the boundary surfaces around the whole core.
        This action means that, forcibly, and consequential upon the
        existence of the air gap, the flux must be carried through the
        core by that 'yawing' action. It means that substantial energy
        is needed to force the establishment of those fields within the
        iron core. More important, however, from the point of view of
        this invention, it means that the intrinsic magnetic
        polarization effects in adjacent magnetic domains in the iron
        cease to be mutually parallel or orthogonal so as to stay
        directed along axes of easy magnetization. Then, in effect, the
        magnetizing action is not just that of the magnetizing winding
        wrapped around the core but becomes also that of adjacent
        ferromagnetic polarization as the latter act in concert as
        vacuum-energy powered solenoids and are deflected into one
        another to develop the additional forward magnetomotive forces.
      </p>
      <p>The consequences of this are that the intrinsic ferromagnetic
        power source with its thermodynamic ordering action contributes
        to doing work in building up forces across the air gap. The
        task, in technological terms, is then to harness that energy as
        the gap is closed, as by poles coming together in a reluctance
        motor, and avoid returning that energy as the poles separate,
        this being possible if the controlling source of primary
        magnetization is well removed from the pole gap and the
        demagnetization occurs when the poles are at the closest
        position. </p>
      <p>This energy situation is evident in the Moullin data, because
        the constant a. c. voltage implies a constant flux amplitude
        across the air gap if there is no flux leakage in the gap
        region. A constant flux amplitude implies a constant force
        between the poles and so the gap width in relation to this force
        is a measure of the mechanical energy potential of the air gap.
        The reactive volt-amp power assessment over the quarter-cycle
        period representing the polarization demand can then be compared
        with the mechanical energy so made available. As already stated,
        this is how Moullin deduced the theoretical current curve. In
        fact, as his data show, he needed less current than the
        mechanical energy suggested and so he had in his experiment
        evidence of the vacuum energy source that passed unnoticed and
        is only now revealing itself in machines that can serve our
        energy needs. </p>
      <p>In the research leading to this patent application the Moullin
        experiment has been repeated to verify a condition where a
        single magnetizing winding serves three air gaps. The Moullin
        test configuration is shown in Fig. 2, but in repeating the
        experiment in the research leading to this invention, a search
        coil was mounted on the bridging member and this was used to
        compare the ratio of the voltage applied to the magnetizing
        winding and that induced in the search coil. The same fall-off
        feature in current demand was observed, and there was clear
        evidence of substantial excess energy in the air gap. This was
        in addition to the inductive energy that necessarily had to be
        locked into the magnetic core to sustain the 'yawing' action of
        the magnetic flux already mentioned. </p>
      <p>It is therefore emphasized that, in priming the flux 'yawing'
        action, energy is stored inductively in the magnetic core, even
        though this has been deemed to be the energy of flux leakage
        outside the core. The air gap energy is also induction energy.
        Both energies are returned to the source winding when the system
        is demagnetized, given a fixed air gap. If, however, the air gap
        closes after or during magnetization, much of that inductive
        energy goes into the mechanical work output. Note then that the
        energy released as mechanical work is not just that stored in
        the air gap but is that stored in sustaining the 'yaw'. Here,
        then is reason to expect an even stronger contribution to the
        dynamic machine performance, one that was not embraced by the
        calculation of the steady-state situation. </p>
      <p>Given the above explanation of the energy source, the
        structural features which are the subject of this invention will
        now be described. </p>
      <p>The 'yawing' action is depicted in Fig. 3, which depicts how
        magnetic flux navigates a right-angled bend in a magnetic core
        upon passage through an air gap. By over-simplification it is
        assumed that the core has a crystal structure that has a
        preferred axis of magnetization along the broken line path. With
        no air gap, the current needed by a magnetizing winding has only
        to provide enough magnetomotive force to overcome the effects of
        non-magnetic inclusions and impurities in the core substance and
        very high magnetic permeabilities can apply. However, as soon as
        the air gap develops, this core substance has to find a way of
        setting up magnetomotive force in regions extending away from
        the locality of the magnetizing winding. It cannot do this
        unless its effect is so powerful that the magnetic flux
        throughout the magnetic circuit through the core substance is
        everywhere deflected from alignment with a preferred easy axis
        of magnetization. Hence the flux vectors depicted by the arrows
        move out of alignment with the broken line shown. </p>
      <p>There is a 'knock-on' effect progressing all the way around the
        core from the seat of the magnetizing winding and, as already
        stated, this harnesses the intrinsic ferromagnetic power that,
        in a system with no air gap, could only be affected by
        magnetization above the knee of the B-H curve. Magnetic flux
        rotation occurs above that knee, whereas in an ideal core the
        magnetism develops with very high permeability over a range up
        to that knee, because it needs very little power to displace a
        magnetic domain wall sideways and promote a 90°(Degree) or a
        180°(Degree) flux reversal. Indeed, one can have a magnetic
        permeability of 10,000 below the knee and 100 above the knee,
        the latter reducing progressively until the substance saturates
        magnetically. </p>
      <p>In the situation depicted in Figs 2 or 3 the field strength
        developed by the magnetizing windings 1 on magnetic core 2 has
        to be higher, the greater the air gap, in order to achieve the
        same amount of magnetization as measured by the voltage induced
        in a winding (not shown) on the bridging member 3. However, by
        virtue of that air gap there is potential for harnessing energy
        supplied to that air gap by the intrinsic zero-point field that
        accounts for the magnetic permeability being over unity and here
        one can contemplate very substantial excess energy potential,
        give incorporation in a machine design which departs from
        convention. </p>
      <p>One of the applicants has built an operative test machine which
        is configured as depicted schematically in Fig. 4. The machine
        has been proved to deliver substantially more mechanical power
        output than is supplied as electrical input, as much as a ratio
        of 7:1 in one version, anc it can act regeneratively to produce
        electrical power. </p>
      <p>What is shown in Fig. 4 is a simple model designed to
        demonstrate the principle of operation. It comprises a rotor in
        which four permanent magnets 4 are arrayed to form four poles.
        The magnets are bonded into four sectors of a non-magnetic disc
        5 using a high density polyurethane foam filler and the
        composite disc is then assembled on a brass spindle 6between a
        split flange coupling. Not shown in the figure is the structure
        holding the spindle vertically in bearings or the star wheel
        commutator assembly attached to the upper shaft of the spindle.
      </p>
      <p>Note that the magnets present north poles at the perimeter of
        the rotor disc and that the south poles are held together by
        being fimly set in the bonding material. </p>
      <p>A series of four stator poles were formed using magnetic cores
        from standard electromagnetic relays are were positioned around
        the rotor disc as shown. The magnetizing windings 7 on these
        cores are shown to be connected in series and powered through
        commutator contacts 8 by a d. c. power supply. Two further
        stator cores formed by similar electromagnetic relay components
        are depicted by their windings 9 in the intermediate angle
        positions shown and these are connected in series and connected
        to a rectifier 10 bridged by a capacitor 11. </p>
      <p>The rotor spindle 6 is coupled with a mechanical drive (not
        shown) which harnesses the torque developed by the motor thus
        formed and serves as a means for measuring output mechanical
        power delivered by the machine. </p>
      <p>In operation, assuming that the rotor poles are held initially
        off-register with the corresponding stator poles and the hold is
        then released, the strong magnetic field action of the permanent
        magnets will turn the rotor to bring the stator and rotor poles
        into register. A permanent magnet has a strong attraction for
        soft iron and so this initial impulse of rotation is powered by
        the potential energy of the magnets. </p>
      <p>Now, with the rotor acting as a flywheel and having inertia it
        will have a tendency to over-shoot the in-register pole position
        and that will involve a reverse attraction with the result that
        the rotor will oscillate until damping action brings it to rest.
        However, if the contacts of the commutating switch are closed as
        the poles come first into register, the magnetizing windings 7
        will receive a current pulse which, assuming the windings are
        connected in the right sense, tends to demagnetize the four
        stator cores. This means that, as the stator and rotor poles
        separate, the reverse attraction by the magnets is eliminated.
        Indeed, if the demagnetizing current pulses supplied to the
        windings 4 are strong enough, the stator poles can reverse
        polarity and that results in a repulsion giving forward drive to
        the separating rotor poles. </p>
      <p>The net result of this action is that the rotor will continue
        rotating until it passes the dead centre angular position which
        allows the rotor to be attracted in the forward direction by the
        stator poles 90°(Degree) forward of those acting originally. </p>
      <p>The commutating switch 8 needs only to be closed for a limited
        period of angular travel following the top dead centre
        in-register position of the stator and rotor poles. The power
        supplied through that switch by those pulses will cause the
        rotor to continue rotating and high speeds will be achieved as
        the machine develops its full motor function. </p>
      <p>Tests on such a machine have shown that more mechanical power
        can be delivered than is supplied electrically by the source
        powering the action through the commutating switch. The reason
        for this is that, whereas the energy in the air gap between
        rotor and stator poles which is tapped mechanically as the poles
        come into register is provided by the intrinsic power of the
        ferromagnet, a demagnetizing winding on the part of the core
        system coupled across that air gap needs very little power to
        eliminate the mechanical force acting across that air gap.
        Imagine such a winding on the bridging member shown in Fig. 2.
        The action of current in that winding, which sits astride the
        'yawing' flux in that bridging member well removed from the
        source action of the magnetizing windings 1, is placed to be
        extremely effective in resisting the magnetizing influence
        communicated from a distance. Hence very little power is needed
        to overcome the magnetic coupling transmitted across the air
        gap. </p>
      <p>Although the mutual inductance between two spaced-apart
        magnetizing windings has a reciprocal action, regardless of
        which winding is primary and which is secondary, the action in
        the particular machine situation being described involves the
        'solenoidal' contribution represented by the 'yawing'
        ferromagnetic flux action. The latter is not reciprocal inasmuch
        as the flux 'yaw' depends on the geometry of the system. A
        magnetizing winding directing flux directly across an air gap
        has a different influence on the action in the ferromagnetic
        core from one directing flux lateral to the air gap and there is
        no reciprocity in this action. </p>
      <p>In any event, the facts of experiment do reveal that, owing to
        a significant discrepancy in such mutual interaction, more
        mechanical power is fed into the rotor than is supplied as input
        from the electrical source. </p>
      <p>This has been further demonstrated by using the two stator
        windings 9 to respond in a generator sense to the passage of the
        rotor poles. An electrical pulse is induced in each winding by
        the passsage of a rotor pole and this is powered by the inertia
        of the rotor disc 5. By connecting the power so generated to
        charge the capacitor 11 the d. c. power supply can be augmented
        to enhance the efficiency even further. Indeed, the machine is
        able to demonstrate the excess power delivery from the
        ferromagnetic system by virtue of electrical power generation
        charging a battery at a greater rate than a supply battery is
        discharged. </p>
      <p>This invention is concerned with a practical embodiment of the
        motor-generator principles just described and aims, in its
        preferred aspect, to provide a robust and reliable machine in
        which the tooth stresses in the rotor poles, which are
        fluctuating stresses communicating high reluctance drive torque,
        are not absorbed by a ceramic permanent magnet liable to rupture
        owing to its brittle composition. </p>
      <p>Another object is to provide a structure which can be
        dismantled and reassembled easily to replace the permanent
        magnets, but an even more important object is that of minimizing
        the stray leakage flux oscillations from the powerful permanent
        magnets. Their rotation in the device depicted in Fig. 4 would
        cause excessive eddy-current induction in nearby metal,
        including that of the machine itself, and such effects are
        minimized if the flux changes are confined to paths through
        steel laminations and if the source flux from the magnets has a
        symmetry or near symmetry about the axis of rotation. </p>
      <p>Thus, the ideal design with this in mind is one where the
        permanent magnet is a hollow cylinder located on a non-magnetic
        rotor shaft, but, though that structure is within the scope of
        this invention, the machine described will utilize several
        separate permanent magnets approximating, in function, such a
        cylindrical configuration. </p>
      <p>Referring to Fig. 4, it will further be noted that the magnetic
        flux emerging from the north poles will have to find its way
        along leakage paths through air to re-enter the south poles. For
        periods in each cycle of machine operation the flux will be
        attracted through the stator cores, but the passage through air
        is essential and so the power of the magnets is not used to full
        advantage and there are those unwanted eddy-current effects. </p>
      <p>To overcome this problem the invention provides for two
        separate rotor sections and the stator poles become bridging
        members, which with optimum design, allow the flux from the
        magnets to find a route around a magnetic circuit with minimal
        leakage through air as the flux is directed through one or other
        pairs of air gaps where the torque action is developed. </p>
      <p>Reference is now made to Fig. 5 and the sequence of rotor
        positions shown. Note that the stator pole width can be
        significantly smaller that that of the rotor poles. Indeed, for
        operation using the principles of this invention, it is
        advantageous for the stator to have a much smaller pole width so
        as to concentrate the effective pole region. A stator pole width
        of half that of the rotor is appropriate but it may be even
        smaller and this has the secondary advantage of requiring
        smaller magnetizing windings and so saving on the loss
        associated with the current circuit. </p>
      <p>The stator has eight pole pieces formed as bridging members 12,
        more clearly represented in Fig. 7, which shows a sectional side
        view through two rotor sections 13 axially spaced on a rotor
        shaft 14. There are four permanent magnets 15 positioned between
        these rotor sections and located in apertures 16 in a disc 17 of
        a non-magnetic substance of high tensile strength, the latter
        being shown in Fig. 6. The rotor sections are formed from disc
        laminations of electrical steel which has seven large teeth, the
        salient poles. Magnetizing windings 18 mounted on the bridging
        members 12 constitute the system governing the action of the
        motor-generator being described. </p>
      <p>The control circuitry is not described as design of such
        circuitry involves ordinary skill possessed by those involved in
        the electrical engineering art. </p>
      <p>It suffices, therefore, to describe the merits of the
        structural design configuration of the core elements of the
        machine. These concern principally the magnetic action and, as
        can be imagined from Fig. 7, the magnetic flux from the magnets
        enters the rotor laminations by traversing the planar faces of
        the laminations and being deflected into the plane of the
        laminations to pass through one or other of the stator pole
        bridging members, returning by a similar route through the other
        rotor. </p>
      <p>By using eight stator poles and seven rotor poles, the latter
        having a pole width equal to half the pole pitch in an angular
        sense, it will be seen from Fig. 5, that there is always a flux
        passage across the small air gap between stator and rotor poles.
        However, as one pole combination is in-register the
        diametrically-opposed pole combinations are out-of-register. </p>
      <p>As described by reference to Fig. 4 the operation of the
        machine involves allowing the magnet to pull stator and rotor
        poles into register and then, as they separate, pulsing the
        winding on the relevant stator member to demagnetize that
        member. In the Fig. 4 system, all the stator magnetizing
        windings were pulsed together, which is not an optimum way in
        which to drive a multi-pole machine. </p>
      <p>In the machine having the pole structure with one less rotor
        pole than stator poles (or an equivalent design in which there
        is one less stator pole than rotor poles) this pulsing action
        can be distributed in its demand on the power supply, and though
        this makes the commutation switch cicuit more expensive the
        resulting benefit outweighs that cost. </p>
      <p>However, there is a feature of this invention by which that
        problem 15 can be alleviated if not eliminated. </p>
      <p>Suppose that the rotor has the position shown in Fig. 5(a) with
        the rotor pole denoted R1 midway between stator poles S1 and S2
        imagine that this is attracted towards the in-register position
        with stator pole S2. Upon reaching that in-register position, as
        shown in Fig. 5 (c), suppose that the magnetizing winding of
        stator pole S2 is excited by a current pulse which is sustained
        until the rotor reaches the Fig. 5(e) position. The combination
        of these two actions will have imparted a forward drive impulse
        powered by the permanent magnet in the rotor structure and the
        current pulse which suppresses braking action will have drawn a
        smaller amount of energy from the electrical power source that
        supplies it. This is the same process as was described by
        reference to Fig. 4. </p>
      <p>However, now consider the events occurring in the rotor action
        diametrically opposite that just described. In the Fig 5(a)
        position rotor pole R4 has come fully into register with stator
        pole S5 and so stator pole S5 is ready to be demagnetized.
        However, the magnetic coupling between the rotor and stator
        poles is then at its strongest. Note, however, that in that Fig.
        5(a) position R5 is beginning its separation from stator pole
        S6and the magnetizing winding of stator pole S6 must then begin
        draw power to initiate demagnetization. During that following
        period of pole separation the power from the magnet is pulling
        R1 and S2 together with much more action than is needed to
        generate that current pulse needed to demagnetize S6. It
        follows, therefore, that, based on the research findings of the
        regenerative excitation in the test system of Fig. 4, the series
        connection of the magnetizing windings on stators S2 and S6
        will, without needing any commutative switching, provide the
        regenerative power needed for machine operation. </p>
      <p>The complementary action of the two magnetizing windings during
        the pole closure and pole separation allows the construction of
        a machine which, given that the zero-point vacuum energy
        powering the ferromagnet is feeding input power, will run on
        that source of energy and thereby cool the sustaining field
        system. </p>
      <p>There are various design options in implementing what has just
        been proposed. Much depends upon the intended use of the
        machine. If it is intended to deliver mechanical power output
        the regenerative electrical power action can all be used to
        power the demagnetization with any surplus contributing to a
        stronger drive torque by reversing the polarity of the stator
        poles during pole separation. </p>
      <p>If the object is to generate electricity by operating in
        generator mode then one could design a machine having additional
        windings on the stator for delivering electrical power output.
        However, it seems preferable to regard the machine as a motor
        and maximize its efficiency in that capacity whilst using a
        mechanical coupling to an alternator of conventional design for
        the electrical power generation function. In the latter case it
        would still seem preferable to use the self-excitation feature
        already described to reduce commutation switching problems. </p>
      <p>The question of providing for machine start-up can be addressed
        by using a separate starter motor powered from an external
        supply or by providing for current pulsing limited to, say, two
        stator poles. Thus, for example, with the eight stator pole
        configuration, the cross-connected magnetizing windings could be
        limited to three stator pairs, with two stator magnetizing
        windings left free for connection to a pulsed external supply
        source. </p>
      <p>If the latter feature were not required, then the stator
        magnetizing windings would all be connected in pairs on a truly
        diametrically opposite basis. Thus Fig. 8 shows a rotor-stator
        configuration having six stator poles interacting with seven
        rotor poles and stator magnetizing windings linked together in
        pairs. </p>
      <p>The invention, therefore, offers a wide range of implementation
        possibilities, which, in the light of this disclosure will
        become obvious to persons skilled in the electrical engineering
        art, all based, however, on the essential but simple principle
        that a rotor has a set of poles of common polarity which are
        attracted into register with a set of stator poles that are
        suppressed or reversed in polarity magnetically during pole
        separation. The invention, however, also offers the important
        feature of minimizing commutation and providing further for a
        magnetic flux closure that minimizes the leakage flux and
        fluctuations of leakage flux and so contributes to efficiency
        and high torque performance as well as durability and
        reliability of a machine incorporating the invention. </p>
      <p>It is noted that although a machine has been described which
        uses two rotor sections it is possible to build a composite
        version of the machine having several rotor sections. In the
        eventuality that the invention finds use in very large
        motor-generator machines the problem of providing very large
        magnets can be overcome by a design in which numerous small
        magnets are assembled. The structural concept described by
        reference to Fig. 6 in providing locating apertures to house the
        magnets makes this proposal highly feasible. Furthermore, it is
        possible to replace the magnets by a steel cylinder and provide
        a solenoid as part of the stator structure and located between
        the rotor sections. This would set up an axial magnetic field
        magnetizing the steel cylinder and so polarizing the rotor.
        However, the power supplied to that solenoid would detract from
        the power generated and so such a machine would not be as
        effective as the use of permanent magnets such as are now
        available. Nevertheless, should one see significant progress in

        <center><b><font size="+1">Revelation of the Myths of "Unity"
              &amp; Beyond</font></b></center>
      </div>
      <p><br>
        Over 5 years ago I made a reference in a chapter of my book 'The
        Revelation of the Century' in relation to claims on "over 100%
        efficiency". In this book, which is still being distributed
        worldwide by Nexus Magazine, Publisher of Queensland, Australia,
        reference is made to what is erroneously termed "zero point" or
        "beyond unity". On page 14, second to last paragraph, I quoted:
      </p>
      <div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; <br>
        I do not subscribe to the definition of 'beyond unity'. There
        simply cannot be any such state, as the totality of the Universe
        is 'Unity'.</div>
      In support of my reference, I have now expanded upon this matter
      in this new Second Edition 2001. Now I am going to discuss this
      subject in more depth, and my revelations here will no doubt
      shatter the minds of many electrical engineers and scientists
      worldwide, because they have got it all wrong!
      <p>To start with, in orthodox teachings, we have the word
        "efficiency" used extensively in relation to electrical machines
        and devices, etc. So too, we now have the definition of 'over
        100% efficiency' bandied around extensively. Now, this term
        'efficiency', insofar as orthodox teachings are concerned,
        applies only to calculations to 100% and beyond. Now that most
        of the scientific world are now beginning to accept the
        possibility of 'over 100% efficiency', this, in turn, has now
        also spilled over into using the terms of 'unity', 'beyond
        unity', 'negative energy', 'zero point', etc. These terms do not
        necessarily apply because here, in fact, is just where reality
        comes into the act. For instance, if we have a machine or device
        displaying an input of 100 watts and an output of 500 watts,
        this equals 500%. This is so, but it only indicates the degree
        of performance calculated at the end of the day. The shattering
        truth of the matter is that the device is not necessarily
        operating in the realm of 'unity', let alone over unity, zero
        point, negative time, etc. However, a machine or device that
        "measures" over 100% and displays energy "growth" effects, with
        "time", which are "additive" and "accumulative", then this is
        "not" conventional science, but science of another dimension -
        this is UNITY!&nbsp; So, therefore, a machine or device which
        does not display the aforegoing effects, is not a unity or over
        unity device, as is too often claimed. This kind of evidence
        outlined above is, in my knowledge of science, the "only" method
        by which the violation of the Law of Conservation can be proven.
        Ever expanding energy, akin to the now proven and accepted
        evidence of the Expansion of the Universe. </p>

        The permanent magnet rotor of the Adams Machine is of the only
        type of its kind in the world and, due to its unusual materials
        and their geometric placements, the rotor of the Adams Machine
        remains cool and, at most, rises only three to five degrees
        Celsius above ambient under full load! The rare earth magnets of
        the rotor are therefore protected from destruction due to
        excessive heat which would be inevitable in a very short period
        of time in a, for instance, large version of the Faraday
        Machine, and others I could mention. Faraday was brilliant in
        that he well knew the disadvantages and problems to be faced in
        attempting to put the discovery of this puny quantity of energy
        to work, by simply discarding it as a useless oddity, where it
        should have remained. Time has proven that hundreds of people
        worldwide have attempted to construct a viable Faraday machine
        and have all failed to prove excess energy presence, except for
        Tewari and Inomatu, who still have the problem of harnessing the
        high current efficiently without the use of lethal Mercury and
        the dispersement of excessive heat manifesting within the
        machine rotor. </p>

        daily occurrence, major breakthroughs are coming on stream at a
        very fast pace and on a regular basis. Such are some of the

        The sooner people learn that the genius of man is, in reality,
        the genius of our Creator and it is unlimited, the better it
        will be for mankind. To believe otherwise is to state that our
        Creator's genius is limited. Our Creator's genius is not limited
        - it is the false teachings of physics bandied out by the mind
        of man in our Universities and Colleges alike that is limited.
        The laws of physics, as they stand today, are little but
        convenient assumptions ("if it works, leave it alone" kind of
        thinking), where true science (progressive science) abides by
        the Laws of Nature. This is why we humans are fully capable of
        applying the Laws of Nature to physics in our new dimension of
        thought, but still appear reluctant to deprogram when it comes
        to the orthodox and almost religious dogmas of past and
        sacrosanct principles of man-made scientific notions. Our
        Universe is negentropically organised and is proceeding
        transfinitely from disorder to order. It was until recent times
        it was accepted wisdom that the sun revolved around the earth
        and your life depended upon believing it!</div>

            Reversal &amp; His Discoveries</b></p>
      </div>
      <p><br>
        As the inventor of the `Adams Pulsed Electric Motor Generator',
        I write this treatise with a view to keeping it uncluttered from
        unnecessary thcories and mathematics, so that all who read this
        article, whether they be enthusiasts, engineers or scientists,
        are able to follow the text, together with its drawings,
        describing the sequences in various stages of operation of the
        `Adams Advanced PEMG'. </p>
      <div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; <br>
        My various discoveries cover over twenty-five years in the
        fields of electrical rotary machines, with a total of over sixty
        years involvement in communications, broacasting and electrical
        engineering.</div>
      <div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; <br>
        It is my desire that as many free energy enthusiasts as possible
        get into the act of building my original machine whilst, at the
        same time, conducting their own research. Several people in
        different countries have already succeeded in building the
        machine in its original form, as has been outlined in the "Adams
        Manual", with beyond-unity results. After obtaining satisfying
        results from the original version, one would then be better
        equipped to handle the more stringent requirements of the
        'Advanced', or 'Mark II' version. A lot of material in this
        treatise pertains to this 'Mark II' version, i.e., the 'Adams
        Advanced Motor Generator'.</div>
      <div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; <br>
        <b>Losses In Electrical Machines</b></div>
      <p><br>
        Losses in conventional electrical machines are too high and are
        due to magnetic drag, eddy currents and hysterisis, and
        consequent high operating temperatures. </p>
      <div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; <br>
        It was with the above problerms in mind that I was prompted to
        fid a way of overcoming the aforementioned losses, the result of
        which evolved in a machine of beyond-unity capabilities.</div>
      <div style="text-align: left;">As the `Adanis Motor' is a pulsed
        direct-current device, there is no change in polarity of the
        external source; therefore there are no eddy current losses, and
        hysterisis loss in the motor is minuscule; with new matials
        becoming available for stators, the small loss incurred would
        disapear. It matters little, however, as the machine efficiency
        is such that such a minuscule loss is negligible.</div>
      <div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; <br>
        With reference to magnetic drag, this too is virtually
        non-existent, due to the unique design of the machine. A rotor
        pole, upon leaving the attraction area of the stator, is at a
        precise geometrical point - and is suddenly repulsed, thus
        overcoming any possibility of magnetic drag taking place.</div>
      <div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; <br>
        Having outlined the above, I will now explain something
        regarding magnetic drag that won't be found in classical
        teachings or texts: a rotor, once in motion, is mutually
        attracted to any stator in its path. On leaving the stator area,
        however, the stator causes a drag-back effect - classical
        teachings do tell you that much. What classical teaching does
        not tell you is that the energy in the initial attraction equals
        exactly that which causes the drag upon leaving the stator area.
        This is where classical teaching is found wanting. The original
        attraction and secondary attraction exactly cancel one another
        out. Magnetic drag, therefore, does not exist in the straight
        motor version of the `Adams Motor' invention. The machine is
        pulsed before the trailing edge of the rotor magnet can be
        affected. Should the timing be a littie out, the effect would be
        minuscule.</div>
      <div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; <br>
        Having discussed the aforementioned factors, there is littie to
        explain regarding the very low operating temperature of the
        `Adams Motor', as a result of which it does not require the use
        of a cooling fan with its own efficiency loss to counter.</div>

        It has been noted in New Energy News under the title "High
        Current Brushes", on making use of silver and platinum for
        commutator and points: this news is not news to me as, during my
        research in 1976,1 used these materials myself for the above
        purpose. It appears, however, from this article submitted to New
        Energy News that the method for their use, being researched, has
        good prospects. I, for one, look forward to learning of the
        progress in this direction.</div>
      <div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; <br>
        In 1976 I learnt of the high losses of my commutator system and
        first used silver for the star disc and platinum for the points
        with considerable success, and having since used photo and
        magnetic switching with remarkable success. Having, of course,
        kept my research and experimentation to myself over the past two
        decades for reasons associatetl in the main with the
        establishment, and latterly with interational patent law, I was
        forced to withhold all my machine's secrets up until my recent
        decision to publish certain aspects of my work earlier this
        year.</div>

        <b>Recent Discovery by the Author</b> </p>
      <div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; <br>
        One would expect magnetic polarity reversal to be instantaneous
        in a rotary machine between rotor magnet and stator. However,
        this is not so. I have recently discovered that the reversal is
        exponential in tnansition from one polarity to another. When
        this occurs, the magnetic radiation of the rotor pole/s doubles
        and, with no external power aIplied, there is no magnetism in
        the stator pole - so it becomes patently logical that the extra
        energy can only be from the ether (negative-time-nergy).</div>
      <div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; <br>
        <b>Engineering Into Negative Time &amp; Negative Energy</b></div>
      <p><br>
        In the realms of engineering negative energy and negative time,
        I have anticipated there would be a new world of discoveries at
        hand and answers to be found to certain phenomna taking place,
        to which we have all previously been unaccustomed. This
        anticipation has manifested itself all too soon as, since my
        first successfull recent attempts at engineering anti-gravity
        have proven, some interesting phenomena have become revealed,
        one of which is the process of magnetic polarity reversal, or
        conversion. </p>
      <div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; <br>
        In an endeavour to discover what actually takes place during
        this 'conversion' of magnetic polarity, I used a magnetic
        polarity indicator and compass, but both proved worthless, as
        they simply hunted back and forth due to the pulses of magnetic
        fields from the machine being in motion.</div>
      <div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; <br>
        Subsequent to this attempt, I had meanwhile mude an important
        discovery concerning magnetic polarity reversal, in that it was
        not necessary that the machihe he in motion or apply any
        external energy in oreder for it to bring about the magnetic
        polarity reversal. From this discovery, I became confident that
        I further discovered what actually takes place in this region in
        relation to the reversal phenomenon. In order to implement a
        test on this, I determined that a slow movement of the rotor by
        hand would indicate, on the instruments, what would he taking
        place. This exercise did indeed prove to be of substance, and I
        will now, here, graphically portray the results.</div>
      <div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; <br>
        To deliver power, however, from the negative energy/negative
        time region, the machine must be in motion and, preferably,
        operating at certain harmonic speeds. The accompanying drawings
        give a physical description of the magnetic actions taking place
        as the rotor magnet reaches the stator and commenes to traverse
        though the negative energy/negative time region.</div>
      <div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; <br>
        In a 180 degree configuration, with two stator poles, the same
        actions take place simultaneously in reverse magnetic polarity
        order (as Drawing TD-GOOl, Figure 2, pointers A and B indicate).</div>
      <div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; <br>
        <b>Actions Taking Place in the Adams Advanced (Mark II) Motor
          Generator</b>
        <p>(1) A rotor south pole, upon approaching an open cincuit
          stator, is mutually attracted to it, as depicted by Drawing
          TD-G004, Figure A. [ <i>These figures are missing</i> ]</p>
      </div>
      <div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; <br>
        (2) When the leading edge of a south pole reaches the edge of a
        stator (Figure B), it appears, as it begins to move inwards,
        that the south polarity of the rotor pole is being exponentially
        reversed to north. In addition, the stator now becomes a
        temponary magnet, also exponentially becorning a north pole
        (Figure C). Meanwhile, the rotor magnet is still being attracted
        up to point zero of the stator (Figure D) and, as the leading
        edge of the rotor moves from point zero of the stator
        second-half region (Figure E), it appears that the north
        polarity strength is now increasing exponentially in this region
        and, on becoming parallel, i.e. reaching each other face-to-face
        (Figure F), the magetic polarity reversal is then complete, and
        both magnet and stator poles are at north polarity. lt is in
        this region now that the state of and-gravity and negative time
        exists, with two magnets of like poles attracting each other and
        creating a gravitational repulsive force at the completion of
        the magnetic polarity reversal cycle.</div>
      <div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; <br>
        There is a specific point of `x' from the stator centre where
        the machine is pulsed (refer Drawing TD-G001, Figure 1, A &amp;
        B, pulse angle). Fine tuning the timing at this geometrical
        point, the machine passes into a state of electromotive
        resonance where input power drops dramatically and shaft power
        increases in the negative time and negative energy region.</div>
      <div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; <br>
        In all, the machine benefits from four different force actions
        per revolution and paying a minuscule toll fee for only one.</div>
      <div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; <br>
        Firstly, as depicted by Figure A of Drawing TD-G004, the rotor
        magnet is mutually attracted to the stator (gets away without
        paying for that - explained elsewhere - refer paragraph 4 in
        section headed 'Losses in Electrical Machines'). Secondly, the
        attraction of the gravitational repulsion forces in the anti-
        gravity area (as illustrated in Drawing TD-G001, Figure 2, at
        arrows A &amp; B). Thirdly, from the repulsion pulse of the
        stator at point `x' (refer to pulse angle of Drawing TD-G001,
        Figure 1).</div>
      <div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; <br>
        Fourthly, the rotor is given a further pulse from the collapsing
        field (a few degrees from potra `x' in Figure 1).</div>
      <div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; <br>
        For maximum possible results from the `Adams Advanced (Mark II)
        Motor', it is necessary to apply harmonic/resonance equations
        for the calculation of all parameters including speeds and
        frequency. With the foregoing parameters met, it is recommended
        to engage magnetic or photo switching with its low loss, high
        efficiency properties. Drawing TD-G002, on the left, illustrates
        a positive `untuned state' and, on the right of the same
        drawing, a `tuned resonant state', together with a graph showing
        relative polarity change with component dimension changes. The
        area within the lower circle of the system indicates both poles
        are at north polarity (note the two curved arrows at each side
        of the magnet pole which depict the change that is/has taken
        place in the negative-time area).</div>
      <div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; <br>
        It is possible to engineer the `Adams Advanced (Mark II) PEMG'
        in such a way that a machine of any desired efficiency may be
        constructed from 100% up to four figures and beyond.</div>
      <div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; <br>
        The term `efficiency' now becomes a matter to be addressed,
        which I have done in the section headed `Free-Energy Devices and
        the Term `Efficiency' and its Connotations'.</div>
      <div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; <br>
        <b>Permanent Magnets &amp; Work</b></div>
      <p><br>
        Permanent magnets do not and can not `do work' --- as claimed by
        certain people. </p>
      <div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; <br>
        It is the ether/gravity forces which cause immense attraction
        and/or repulsion to take place between a permanent magnet and
        other magnetic material. It is these ether forces that,
        combining with the captive permanent magnet fields, harness the
        energy of gravity ether forces, so often erroneously referred to
        as `work' `done by magnets' (refer to notes on Nikola Tesla at
        the end of this section).</div>
      <div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; <br>
        The magnets in this situation are simply acting `as a gate',
        making way to the ether for the collection/release of
        gravitational/ether energy. The pemanent magnet is a component
        in the system, operating as a `gating device', as explained
        elsewhere in my writing --- the magnet does not generate or
        create power (refer to Drawing TD-G005).</div>
      <div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; <br>
        If magnets were doing `work', they would heat up! The contrary
        takes place in negative-time systems during operation: rotor
        magnets drop in temperature below ambient in the above-described
        enviromnent. Subtracting the drop in temperature of the rotor
        magnets from any small rise (if any) in stator temperature, due
        to minuscule hysterisis, would cancel the difference. The deeper
        the condition of resonance in the system, the lower the
        temperature of the magnets and stator windings.</div>
      <div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; <br>
        When magnets and stators are engineered into negative time, the
        rotor, upon eclipsing face-to-face with the stator poles, causes
        a state of negative energy/negative time in that area at that
        moment in time. Aimost simultaneously there is, in addition, the
        vector zero stress due to the resonantly-tuned wave trains of
        the stator pole generated voltage with that of the pulse voltage
        wave, resulting in a near mirror image.</div>
      <div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; <br>
        The negative time/negative energy area between rotor magnet and
        stator independently causes an increase of 100% magnetic
        radiation every time a pole of the rotor passes a stator.
        <p>In this negative time, gravitational force is reversed; so in
          negative time, gravity becomes a repulsion force, not an
          attraction force.</p>
      </div>
      <div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; <br>
        <b>Negative Time/Negative Energy Radiation Pattern ~</b></div>
      <p><br>
        Irrespective of a magnet's gauss rating in a negative
        time/negative energy device, the area of magnetic radiation can
        be seen to double when a specific magnet and stator are
        engineered into `negative time'. This radiation originates at
        toe centre of the negative time region between the magnet and
        the stator, and spreads out radially and diminishes in strength
        as the square of the distance. </p>
      <div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; <br>
        The enormous increase in radiation into space, and negative
        energy developed, is not generated by the magnet, as a lot of
        people would have you believe. Its source is (again) due to the
        magnet forming a gate and tapping gravitational energy with the
        result of gravitational repulsion, as explalned in `Engineering
        into Negative Time and Negative Energy'.</div>
      <div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; <br>
        The area of radiation so covered by a negative time/negative
        energy device measures always an exact electromagnetic light
        gravity harmonic distance figure taken from point of origin.</div>
      <div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; <br>
        These above statements are not theoretical but are indeed
        discoveries and results of actual tests and measurements
        undertaken in the laboratory by myself.</div>

        <b>Nikola Tesla</b></div>
      <p><br>
        While going through my notes and excerpts on Nikola TeSla's
        findings on Sunday 20 June 1993, I discovered a prepared
        statement of Tesla's 10 July 1937 work and another from the <i>New

















          York Herald Tribune</i> dated 11 September 1932. </p>
      <div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; <br>
        Tesla's statement below, dated 10 July 1937, vindicates
        completely my statement that magnets do not and can not `do
        work'. Tesla's statement is:</div>
      <div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; <br>
        "There is no energy in matter other than that received from the
        environment. It applies rigorously to molecules and atoms as
        well as the largest heavenly bodies and to all matter in the
        universe in any phase of its existence from its very formation
        to its ultimate disintegralion."</div>
      <div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; <br>
        "A few words will be sufficient in support of this contention.
        The kinetic and potential energy of a body is the result of
        motion and determined by the product of its mass and the square
        of velocity. Let the mass be reduced, the energy is diminished
        in the same proporlion. If it be reduced to zero, the energy is
        likewise zero for any finite velocity. In other words, it is
        absolutely impossible to convert mass into energy. It would be
        different if there were forces in nature capable of imparting to
        a mass infinite velocity. Then the product of zero mass with the
        square of infinite velocity would represent infinite energy. But
        we know that there are no such forces and the idea that mass is
        convertible into energy is rank nonsense."</div>
      <div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; <br>
        Nikola Tesla's statement of 11 September 1932, <i>New York
          Herald Tribune</i> is:</div>
      <div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; <br>
        "The assumption of the Maxwellian ether was thought necessary to
        explain the propagation of light by transverse vibrations, which
        can only occur in a solid. So fascinating was this theory that
        even at present it has many supporters, despite the manifest
        impossibility of a medium, perfectly mobile and tenuous to a
        degree inconceivable, and yet extremely rigid, like steel. As a
        result, some illusionary ideas have been formed and various
        phenomena erroneously interpreted. The so-called Hertz waves are
        still considered a reality, proving that light is electrical in
        its nature, and also that the ether is capable of transmitting
        transverse vibrations of frequencies however low. This view has
        become untenable, since I showed that the universal medium is a
        gaseous body in which only longitudinal pulses can be
        propagated, involving alternating compressions and expansions
        similar to those produced by sound waves in the air. Thus, a
        wireless transmitter does not emit Hertz waves, which are a
        myth, but sound waves in the ether, behaving in every rescect
        like those in the air, except that, owing to the great elastic
        force and extremely small density of the medium, their speed is
        that of light."</div>
      <div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; <br>
        Although personal friends, Tesla and Einstein did not always
        agree with each other on certain points. However what Teala is
        saying here is that though 'E=Mc2', you can't simply choose a
        lump of mass such as a permanent magnet, place it in a system
        and extract energy from it, As aforesaid, in Tesla's own words,
        "the idea that mass is convertible into energy is rank nonsese."</div>
      <div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; <br>
        <b>Free Energy Devices &amp; the Term 'Efficiency' &amp; Its
          Connotations</b></div>
      <p><br>
        The term `efficiency' or `efficiency losses' relative to an
        external souree, loses all substance or meaning when considering
        devices capable or well beyond unity. The term is no longer a
        yardstick, so to speak' as it becomes a relic of establishment
        teachings and present-day so-called conservation of energy laws,
        which now require to he rewritten. We must, therefore, now have
        a negentropy law. </p>
      <div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; <br>
        Losses, if indeed any exist in a beyond-unity device, would be
        minuscule and of no subsance, due to the output capacity of the
        device.</div>
      <div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; <br>
        In my opinion, the most salient factor to look for in a device
        clalmed to operate beyond unity, is its operating temperature
        under full load. This factor tells all, without the initial
        necessity to carry out exhaustive test procedures.</div>
      <div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; <br>
        The matter of temperature or beyond-unity devices brings to mind
        Tesla's electric car. It is stated in my notes that the machine
        becnes very hot during operation. This, or course, is to be
        expected, as the `free-energy section' of the machine is a
        separate entity to the car motor proper, and in the year 1931,
        when Tesla tested his "Pierce Arrow" car, conventional DC motors
        were notoriously inefficient-around the order of 35 percent, -
        and, incidentally, meanwhile, haven't improved that much. In
        addition, the confined space would have also been of no help,
        even with the assistance of a fan, which also had to be used
        according to his notes.</div>
      <div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; <br>
        However, in contrast, my beyond-unity power device (`gravity
        generator') would be operating at least 2O to 40 degrees
        Centigrade below ambient. As the father of many discoveries and
        inventions pertaining to coils, transformers, pulsing systems
        and electric motors, on reflection it is unfortunate that Tesla
        hadn't figured out what could be done with his pulsing systems
        in relation to electric motors. Had he done so, be would not
        have required (according to Muller) powerfull magnets or a
        cooling fan.</div>
      <div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; <br>
        It is my opinion, after many years' experience in the
        fire-energy research field, that a table of negative
        time/negative energy `rating' be formulated in relation to
        devices using permanent magnets in fire-energy applications. I
        am, at present, endeavouring to work out a system or magnetic
        radiation field strength measurement as a possible means or
        evaluating rotary devices that utilise permanent magnets. A
        system of this nature would distinguish `beyond- unity shoptalk'
        from `conventional shoptalk' and the term `efficiency' would
        remaln relegated to conventional devices. As the future
        `beyond-unity empire' will grow and mature, so conventionalism,
        along with its present terminology, will wither and die.</div>
      <div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; <br>
        The universe is negentropically organised and is proceeding
        transfinitely from disorder to order. This is not the concept of
        energy taught today in college and university camppuses which
        persist in drumming in the long since foregone notions or Sir
        Isaac Newton and James Clerke Maxwell. We are, right this very
        moment, entering a new era of science, somewhat divorced from
        the trappings the establishment has been peddling for decades.
        We do not need to `wait upon' the establishant to catch up to us
        here, for if we did we would still be a century behind in a
        century's time. It is for the establishment teachings to latch
        onto us, which they will do - eventually - one day. In the
        meatime, new science will continue to force ahead regardless,
        until sheer embarrassment will force classical teaching out the
        door.</div>
      <div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; <br>
        With anti-gravity / beyond-unity devices, we must now go on to
        reconstitute our scientific laws and introduce a few new ones.
        As aforementioned, one being a negentropy law within which we
        must now go on to agree to the use of a more appropriate term of
        measurement for devices using permanent magnets in free energy
        applications; and, as aforesaid, the term `rating' comes to
        mind. For the pupose of thist treatise l will now propose to use
        the term `beyond-unity rating' or `BUR' as an abbreviation, for
        the moment.</div>
      <div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; <br>
        'Beyond-unity devices' `ratings' should, in my opinion, be
        according to an accepted table of values, ranging from what is,
        at present, termed `unity' upwards, and thereby dumping the term
        `efficiency' completely.</div>
      <div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; <br>
        As there is no upper limit of negative energy other than
        `blastoff and/or `self-annihilation' upon reaching absolute
        resonance, then a suitable table of values, with a suitable
        baseline, would be a practical solution. As the term `unity' has
        been so indelibly engrained, then it would perhaps be suitable
        as a `base'.</div>
      <div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; <br>
        No doubt the establishment will `perform' at my suggestions
        and/or recommendations on this - so be it. It would only take a
        small section of the researchers of new science amongst the
        `beyond-unity circle' to agree upon the adoption of a new system
        of measurement and/or definition and publish it internationally
        along with the appropriate table of figure ratings. This would
        then enable beyond-unity researchers and adherents alike a more
        realistic platform as a base to work from, whilst still allowing
        the term `efficiency' to apply to conventional below-unity
        aparatus.</div>
      <div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; <br>
        This adoption of a new and separate system (or law) of the
        measurnent of over-unity devices will, at the outset, identify
        and distinguish the subject of beyond-unity from its
        conventional counterparts and allow beyond-unity and
        anti-gravity researchers to get on with the job without
        harrassment from the classical thinkers.</div>

        <b>The Real McCoy</b> </p>
      <p>It is with great excitement, and appreciation to the inventor,
        that <i>Nexus</i> publishes the following information on the
        Permanent Magnet Electric D.C. Motor Generator of Robert Adams,
        a former Chairman of the Institute of Electrical &amp;
        Electronics Engineers, Inc., U.S.A., (N.Z. Section). </p>
      <p>Afer having his invention suppressed for over 20 years, Mr
        Adams, at the age 72, has decided to share his design with the
        world regardless of the consequences. Mr. Adams' quest to bring
        "free" energy to the world has cost him dearly, as it has many
        other researchers who threaten to bring the "establishment"
        undone. </p>
      <p>He has survived an attempt on his life by an individual
        affiliated with the New Zealand Secret Intelligence Service and
        the Central Intelligence Agency, direct suppression of his
        invention by former (and recently deceased) Prime Minister of
        New Zealand, Roben Muldoon, the giant British electronics
        company, Lucas Industries, as well as numerous other
        insurmountable difficulties that have been placed in his path.
        All because his invention worked. And not only that, it is so
        simple, any electronics manufacturer or skilled
        backyard-home-scientist could build one! </p>
      <p><b>Inventors Beware!</b> </p>
      <p>In 1978 Mr. Adams discovered that inventors of machines or
        devices of high energy efficiency capability ("Free" Energy) are
        not only refused patents, but that in most cases, their
        inventions are classified under the "Military Use Clause", which
        is, of course, international. Inventors are prohibited from
        publishing details of their devices or promoting them in any
        manner if their invention is classified under this clause. In
        other words, their devices automatically become the sole
        property of the "establishment". </p>
      <p>The fact that there is an established mechanism to suppress
        energy inventions of this nature has been a closely guarded
        secret for many years. Many inventors have made such claims, but
        the general public rentain oblivious to the fact that they are
        being deprived of clean and free energy by organisations that
        would rather make money and hold power over We public, than
        allow such technology to become widely available. Yet another
        example of the abuse of power. (No pun intended.) </p>
      <p><b>"Free Energy"</b> </p>
      <p>This motor generator would be called a "Free Energy" machine by
        most individuals. It is, in fact, a device that converts the
        perpetual motion of sub-atomic particles, known in physics
        terminology as "particle spin", into conventional electric
        power. It is a widely accepted fact of physical law that
        sub-atomic particles are in a state of perpetual motion. Anybody
        who tells you that there is no such thing as perpetual motion is
        either ignorant or a liar. </p>
      <p>As Robert Adams states, "Our universe is a sea of energy -
        free, clean energy. "It is all out there waiting for us to set
        sail upon it" Adams has built a number of permanent magnet
        electric D.C. motor generators based on the principle outlined
        in this article, some of which have demonstrated an electrical
        efficiency of 690% and a mechanical efficiency of 620%. The
        devices run at room temperature. Any device that doesn't could
        not be running at over 100% efficiency, as heat is the major
        result of hysteresis losses that are induced in any conventional
        electric motor or generator. Radiated heat is a sure-fire sign
        that a power generator is not running over unity, as all heat
        radiated by such a device is wasted energy. </p>
      <p>I will remind readers once again at this point that Mr Adams is
        not a fly-by- night, propeller-head, whacko, techno-boffin. He
        is an electrical engineer with over 60 years experience in the
        field of electrical engineering, which has included designing
        and building equipment for use in power stations, broadcasting
        facilities, airport communications centres, etc. He is a former
        Chairman of the Institute of Electrical &amp; Electronics
        Engineers, Inc., U.S.A., (N.Z. Section), and his resume includes
        personal referees ranging from a former New Zealand Commissioner
        of Police, a former Chairman of Air New Zealand, (and several
        technical specialists from the airline), as well as an Ex- NASA
        scientist. Nexus would recommend to anybody interested in, or
        presently building a device of this nature, to try building a
        device based on Mr. Adams plans. His machines have demonstrated
        the ability to generate free energy, unlike most of the
        theoretical models that are promoted as over-unity devices. </p>
      <p><b>General Description</b> </p>
      <p>The invention may be broadly said to be, an electric motor
        and/or generator comprising a rotor consisting of a number of
        radially arrayed permanently magnetised poles, and a stator
        consisting of a number of radially arrayed permanently
        magnetised poles, together with a number of wound poles. The
        rotor's permanently magnetised poles use ferite magnetic cores,
        and may comprise any even number of poles. The stator's wound
        poles employ steel or iron cores. The device is essentially a
        D.C. machine, but may be fed A.C. input with the use of a solid
        state convertor. </p>
      <p>The Rotor uses a number of similar polarity permanent magnetic
        poles, i.e., all-South or all-North. A further set of wound
        poles are radially arrayed in the stator, and are arranged in
        such a manner as to be fed energy, that is excited by back
        E.M.F. energy, from the poles of the rotor. </p>
      <p>Associated circuitry is provided to feed the energy back to the
        drive poles of the motor. </p>
      <p>The resulting characteristics of this design is that once the
        rotor is moved from the position of equilibrium, each pole is
        attracted to, or repulsed by the stator poles, but at a precise
        geometrical point with respect to them, the input current to the
        drive coils ceases. As a result, the collapsing field current is
        in the opposite direction to the applied force, thus reversing
        the magnetic polarity of the stator coils. This forces the rotor
        poles away (reaction), which is the instantaneous response of a
        system to an applied force, and is manifested as the exertion of
        a force equal in magnitude, but opposite in direction to the
        applied force. </p>
      <p>Pulsing the D.C. input current, overcomes losses generated in
        conventional motors. According to classical electrical
        engineering theory, efficiency is greater the more nearly equal
        the Back E.M.F. (electromotive force) is to the applied voltage,
        i.e. the lower the input current. Figure 6 shows that there is
        minimum 100% back E.M.F. relative to the supply source of input
        D.C. voltage (according to classical electrical theory), which
        virtually depicts a sine wave due to the effect of the
        collapsing field. </p>
      <p>This effect also overcomes the electrodynamic torque problems
        associated with conventional motor designs. (As input power
        varies with the duty cycle pulse; i.e. the lower the input
        current, the lower the input current, and the lower the speed,
        the greater the torque.) At clipoff, the badk-EMF ceases, the
        collapsing field takes over, opposing the outgoing rotor magnet
        and thus increasing momentum. With this design force is applied
        twice during each D.C, pulse, with pulse-on, and with pulse-off.
      </p>
      <p>The timing of the pulses are determined by the dimensions of
        the motor itself, i.e. the speed of rotation of the motor's
        central axle, the position of the rotor magnets in relation to
        the stator windings, as well as the distance that the rotor
        magnets travel when passing across the poles of the stator
        winding. </p>

        <b>Construction &amp; Operating Notes</b> </p>
      <p><i>Important Factors</i>:&nbsp; Care must be exercised when
        assembling and wiring the drive windings to make sure that their
        polarities match the rotor magnet polarity. Common earthing must
        be avoided in order to preclude voltage and/or current loops.
        (If a number of drive windings do need to be commoned, use very
        low resistance conductors and employ a transmission type
        earthing system only.) </p>
      <p>Stator (Drive) winding resistances are your choice. Robert
        Adams' machines were built varying from 0.03125 to 27 ohms per
        set, He has experimented with two, four, and eight pole
        machines. Efficiency increases with the number of wound poles in
        the stator. </p>
      <p>Motor generators with a single, two, or three phase can be
        built to this design. A number of rotors may be ganged together
        on the same shaft in order to increase power output and does not
        require the use of any commutator, brushes or slip rings, all of
        which contribute to energy losses in ordinary motor generators.
      </p>
      <p>Unlike conventional Series D.C, machines, this motor can be
        off-loaded, finds its own speed, and will run at that speed
        indefinitely. A conventional DC motor will run itself to
        destruction with off-loading. It requires no cooling, nor any
        overload protection, even if short circuited. </p>
      <p>A number of highly qualified individuals have seen these
        devices running and producing energy at well above 100%
        efficiency. Let's hope that some of you can achieve similar
        results. </p>
      <p><b>General Construction &amp; Testing Procedures</b> </p>
      <p>An ideal drive winding pole can be very readily available by
        obtaining some B.P.O: 3000 type relays (ex Telecom). Simply
        remove present wmding, cut core in half, re-thread, assemble and
        fill with winding. This is a quick and cheap method of obtaining
        a very high quality non-retentive steel core. As aforementioned,
        winding resistances used by the inventor varied between 0.03125
        to 27 ohms. </p>
      <p>The above windings described are ample to drive prototypes even
        in a 180' application. You will find speeds up to 2500 rpm with
        only two of these windings 180' apart - no problem. </p>
      <p>For A,C. Output Coil Windings and Core: Ideal cores can be
        built cheaply and quickly by dismantling a spare power or audio
        transformer and utilising the 'I' section laminations, obtain
        winding former to fit same and it is ready for winding. Turns
        and gauge will depend on what voltage and current you choose.
        Remember, at this stage, you should only be building a
        demonstration model, so to speak. </p>
      <p>After a few changes, corrections and/or general modifications
        you will be ready to put a mechanical and/or electrical load on
        the machine. For an electrical load it is suggested you firstly
        wire up a bank of 6 - 12 LEDs. If everything is go, then switch
        over to torch lamps: Later on with a bigger machine - car lamps,
        or maybe household lamps and a mechanical load simultaneously. </p>
      <p><i>For Efficiency Testing</i>: Milliamp meters are useless for
        this machine - do not use for testing. Use only high quality
        digital true RMS meters, with input power, for high accuracy,
        use only a high quality electronic wattmeter: These instruments
        measure extremely accurately any wave-shape. A good twin-beam
        oscilloscope is a must: So too a high quality electronic
        temperature-measuring instrument with appropriate probe. </p>
      <p>Drill dead centre of one or both cores, as per drawing. Probe
        be must be good fit. If, after one hour of running on load and
        temperatare is around 40 degrees, that will indicate things are
        most likely working correctly. </p>
      <p>Don't forget your ambient in Australia will be considerably
        higher than ours. Read the inventor's rotary and solid state
        efficiency measurarnent data sheet. </p>
      <p>Rotor-stator air gap is not critical, but the closer the
        better. </p>
      <p>As stated elsewhere, the stator pole faces, if desired, may be
        reduced to 25% of the rotor pole face area, hence large drive
        windings and high drive current is not required. </p>
      <p>With care to detail, correct mathematical calculations and high
        quality instrumentation correctly utilised, incredible results
        can be expected. Study data submitted shows those results have
        been attained on several machines. </p>
      <p>Temperature of conventional machines internally reach boiling
        point after fifteen minutes running. Check the Adams Mctor
        Generator after running on full load for 48 hours, or after
        fifteen minutes if you prefer not to wait that long. You will be
        very pleasantly surprised - I refer to maximum loading
        conditions, not free running. </p>
      <p><i>Mechanical Loading Test</i>: A high quality strain measuring
        instrument must be used in the universal "pony brake' method of
        mechanical load testing. </p>
      <p>RPM tests must also be obtained with a high quality tachometer
        and/or oscilloscope reading and use the universal equation to
        calculate mechanical machine efficiency. </p>
      <p><i>Note:</i> <i>Very Important Factor ---&nbsp;</i> As you
        increase duty cycle, current input will increase and efficiency
        will decrease. From random test sheet results I have chosen it
        is very clear what to expect upon increasing duty cycle. </p>
      <p><i>Note</i>: The Adams Motor Generator is so efficient, so
        simple and consequently it's construction is such that it
        surpasses overwhelmingly anything before it, thus lending itself
        admirably to mass production. </p>
      <p>One of a number of unique features of the Adams Machine is the
        fact that the same rotor poles are utilised simultaneously for
        driving the machine and generating output energy. </p>
      <p><i>Construction Equation - Adams Motor Generator</i>&nbsp;
        (20-12-76): It was found, after considerable development work,
        that maximum electro- magnetic effect produced in the stalloy
        stacked generating pole windings occurred when the dimension of
        the mating end of the stacks were four times greater in area
        than the rotor magnet's pole area. Hence the overall design of
        the machine incorporates this derived ratio of one to four. (The
        Adams Equation, as applies only to the Adams Machine). </p>
      <p><i>Feedback</i>&nbsp; (20-12-1976):&nbsp; The feedback,
        produced by the output generating coil, produces a polarity
        reversal normally resulting in large eddy current losses in
        conventional machines, but, in the Adams Machine, it is hamessed
        to develop further additional torque to the magnetic rotor. The
        larger the output generating coils the greater the torque
        delivered to the rotor. </p>
      <p><i>Power Factor</i> (1-7-1976): There is no power factor loss
        because the Adams Machine runs in a condition of resonance.
        Therefore, the Power Factor Loss is zero. </p>

      </div>
      <p><br>
        I have for many years theorised the existence of four poles
        interacting in any magnet. There is little doubt that two poles
        dominate from what is observed, and taught, in classical texts.
      </p>
      <p>However, since my discovery of engineering magnets into forming
        four poles - and, in so doing, quadrupling the energy - surely
        some light has been shed on the theory of the existence of four
        poles. Bruce Cathie and I will investigate this further when
        time permits. </p>
      <p>A rectangular or cube magnet, when engineered into the Adams
        technology, becomes a unit consisting of four twin poles, each
        face containing a north and a south pole, separated by a zero
        vortex in the centre of each of the four twin poles, and all
        displaying similar energies. </p>
      <p>Ironically, but not unexpectedly, this super twin-pole magnet
        is a very valuable adjunct to further advancement of the Adams
        Motor technology. The energy found on the edges of each of the
        four faces is very high-25 per cent of the total energy of the
        full face. </p>
      <p>The present lab magnets are approximately
        three-quarters-of-an-inch cube. The edge of any face will hold a
        five-kilogram steel or iron block in mid-air. When the full face
        of the magnet is attached to metal, a force of beyond 20 kg is
        required to remove it. In my presentation to the NEXUS
        Conference, I advised tests would be carried out this month to
        determine the strain required to remove the magnet. </p>
      <p>The dice-sized magnet was attached to a steel plate on a
        ceiling rafter and, with the aid of a chain, a 15-kilogram block
        was first attached to it; then a 4.7-kg block added on with a
        nylon rope; then another 200-gram block was attached; then, a
        fourth 2W-gram block. The magnet still hanging fast, a 100-gram
        block was added; then...wait for it...CRASH to the floor. The
        magnet was still attached to its anchor on the roof-rafter! </p>
      <p>A magnet, approximately three-quarters-of-an-inch cube,
        weighing only 60 grams, capable of holding a weight of beyond 20
        kilograms in mid-air, 333.333 times its own weight? Will this at
        last have something of an effect on the closed ignorant minds of
        conventional science? </p>
      <p>The way now must surely be clear that space/gravity energy via
        electromagnetic forces of permanent magnets is not impossible
        nor difficult to harness. The space/gravity energies are clean,
        non-exhaustible and free. The Adams technology has proved this
        and leaves no grounds for dispute. </p>
      <p>Einstein's sacrosanct theories of relativity, and the laws of
        thermodynamics, are the most remarkable and inexplicable
        aberrations ever recorded in scientific history. These draconian
        false teachings have been instrumental in impeding tbe process
        of science towards free, clean energy. </p>
      <p><b>Classical Theory &amp; Adams Technology</b> </p>
      <p>The classical theory of magnetism from the textbooks attiibutes
        the phenomenon to the motion of electrons within the atoms of
        molecules. There is evidence that the orbital electrons in an
        atom not only revolve about the nucleus of the atom, but also
        each individual electron spins about an axis througb its centre.
        Isis believed that in highly magnetic materials, each atom has
        many more electrons spinning in one direction than in another. </p>
      <p>In the submicroscopic region, i.e., the "domain", many of these
        atoms with electron spin in one direction create a magnetic
        field which effectively supplements the field engendered by the
        revolving electrons. Each domain thus becomes a tiny magnet.
        When the domains are in random state, the substance as a whole
        is not a magnet. The application of external magnetic field will
        reorient the domains and produce a magnet in the way described
        above. </p>
      <p>When the application of an external magnetic force has been
        applied and all the domains have been aligned, the condition of
        MAGNETIC SATURATION has been reached, and any further increase
        in strength of the external force field will not increase the
        magnetisation of the iron any further. With the advent of the
        Adams Permanent Magnet Technology, is it not further evidence
        that conventional text teachings have reached the stage when
        they should be rewritten? </p>
      <p>From the observations of certain lab experiments with
        ball-bearings, it is the opinion of the discoverer that the
        electrons circulate in conjugate pairs and have a spin opposite
        to that of rotation, and that the spin is four times greater
        than that of the orbital rotation. I note also that conventional
        texts prefer not to state direction of spin, nor velocity
        relative to orbital motion. </p>
      <p>I do not therefore subscribe to the statement that "in highly
        magnetic materials, each atom has many more electrons spinning
        in one direction than in another". I feel such a condition
        cannot pertain in light of my discoveries. </p>
      <p>Also to be addressed is the matter of the massive energy
        increase resulting from the Adams applied technology. Are
        man-made scientific laws once again violated? If the magnetic
        material is saturated when subjected to an external energy
        source, the Adams technology must then be gating space/gravity
        energy. </p>
      <p>There is overwhelming evidence that space/gravity energy can be
        concentrated, focused and/or magnified by permanent magnets. </p>

        A young enthusiastic colleague of mine, currently resident in
        Auckland, New Zealand, by the name of Andrew Thorpe, phoned me
        today to advise that David Saltresse of Wales, Great Britain,
        had contacted him via email to advise him he had worked out the
        geometric placement of all 4 of the output A.C. generator
        windings of one of my motor generators which was originally
        invented in the early seventies. </p>
      <p>He advised Andrew that the geometric placement of the output
        generator stator windings was measured with the aid of
        incorporating the Golden Ratio. "All 4", David said, "are found
        to confirm they correspond directly with the golden ratio
        geometrics". </p>
      <p>There was always the remote possibility that out of the many
        hundreds of people worldwide who would have attempted to
        replicate my original machines, few, if any, would have taken
        the advantage of probing deep into the detailed schematic
        diagram of this particular motor generator which I included in
        my original motor manual, published by <i>Nexus Magazine</i>,
        possibly because that schematic diagram appears at first glance
        unorthodox or a difficult exercise to achieve!&nbsp; As David
        Saltresse discovered, this is not so, if you look with eyes to
        see at this schemtic diagram. Congratulations go to David
        Saltresse of Wales. </p>
      <div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; <br>
        Now, further secrets are revealed in which I can advise readers
        that I apply the so named "Sacred Geometry" of the golden ratio
        in conjunction with a very important natural occuring constant
        of nature. I also apply this same equation to resistance
        measurements, load resistances, voltage, geometrics of magnets,
        rotor and stator dimensions. This equation also applies to the
        mass and placement of the addition of certain unusual material
        used in the construction of this awesome heat generating rotor
        system. This is a unique system in that it is an implosive and
        totally reverse engineered mahcine which operates in the real
        realm of unity. The power manifested over time is "infinite" and
        therefore immeasurable. A reminder here to those unaccustomed to
        the understanding of the condition known as Infinite Energy,
        irrespective of any measurement of input energy losses and input
        power, there is no known value / measurement of infinite energy
        output power. Because of its infinity it simply cannot be
        measured!</div>

              Technologies</font></b></center>
      </div>
      <p><br>
        From a number of reports I am in receipt of I find experimenters
        are using powerful rare earth magnets in their machines.&nbsp;
        This is in order only if you are incorporating the correct
        operating parameters, i.e., first of all upon handling the
        magnets, it is very quickly recognised that they are very
        powerful for such small dimensions.&nbsp; Does it not strike you
        then that since they display such obvious considerable power, is
        it then not logical that considerable impulsing power is going
        to be required to drive the machine once the magnets are
        installed in the device. </p>
      <p>The cardinal mistake being made here is that most of these
        experimenters are concerned about I²R losses!&nbsp; If you are
        seeking high/super performance with these powerful magnets, then
        discard all concerns in relation to Ohms Law, for in the Adams
        technologies Ohms Law becomes a non-entity.&nbsp; Instead of
        expecting results of a high order with stators of very low
        resistance, such as under 10ohms, increase the total series
        electrical resistance instead to 72ohms and instead of expecting
        spectacular results using these powerful magnets with only 12 -
        24 volts, increase the voltage to a minimum of 120v.&nbsp; Upon
        having done this you must give attention to other important
        factors, i.e., stator to magnet air gap should be 1 - 1.25mm,
        impulse duty cycle should be 0.25 - 0.35, "mosfet" gate signal
        impulse 10 - 20v of good clean stable D.C.&nbsp; Upon initial
        experimental tests, I have always used batteries.&nbsp; Reduce
        the face area of stators to 75% of the magnet face. </p>
      <p>Now having said all this, choose your own method of signal
        switching, whether it be photo, Hall, magnetic, reed or
        mechanical, etc. </p>
      <p>Upon fine tuning, and now having reached greatly increased
        power and performance, 'DOUBLE' the power supply voltage to 240v
        and you will have a machine in the "kilowatt" range, the
        exciting stage of your progress.&nbsp; There are a number of
        various methods of harnessing considerable aetheric energy from
        these machines.&nbsp; In this respect I strongly urge you to
        study Tesla radiant energy. </p>

        <b>Construction Equation - Adams Motor Generator (20-12-1976)</b>
      </p>
      <p>It was found, after considerable development work, that maximum
        electromagnetic effect produced in the stalloy [sic] stacked
        generating pole windings occurred when the dimension of the
        mating end of the stacks were four times greater in area than
        the rotor magnet's pole area. Hence the overall design of the
        machine incorporates this derived ratio of one to four. (The
        Adams Equation, as applies only to the Adams Machine). </p>
      <p><b>Feedback (20-12-1976)</b> </p>
      <p>The feedback, produced by the output generating coil, produces
        a polarity reversal normally resulting in large eddy current
        losses in conventional machines, but, in the Adams Machine, it
        is harnessed to develop further additional torque to the
        magnetic rotor. The larger the output generating coils the
        greater the torque delivered to the rotor. </p>
      <p><b>Power Factor&nbsp; (1-7-1976)</b> </p>
      <p>There is no power factor loss because the Adams Machine runs in
        a condition of resonance. Therefore, the Power Factor Loss is
        zero. </p>
      <p><b>The Adams Pulsed Electric Generator: The Conspiracy</b> </p>
      <p>I have for many years been waiting the opportunity to make a
        start on writing about my life as an electrical engineer and
        inventor, but have been reluctant to do so because of the
        possible reaction from one formidable individual who was
        instrumental in causing me untold frustration, ridicule,
        anxiety, financial problems, and health decline. </p>
      <p>With the passing of Rob Muldoon, I now feel more deposed to
        exposing what he and his regime subjected me to, and the
        possible subsequent valuable loss to our country as a result. I
        personally had a meeting with Muldoon and others at his home
        office in Tamaki regarding my invention. </p>
      <p>The result of the meeting was that he recommended me to the
        Inventions Development Authority. In all good faith I duly
        contacted the inventions development authority and that folks
        was the beginning of the saga which was destined to follow. </p>
      <p>The Inventions Development Authority passed me along to DSIR,
        who at the time were frantically working on their own energy
        systems, and assisting Government with various 'Think Big'
        projects. </p>
      <p>Time rolled on, and DSIR monkeyed me around for several months;
        there were, as always, excuses for not proceeding with
        completion of their strange testing apparatus to test my
        machine. </p>
      <p>In the meantime, Rob Muldoon appoints himself Minister in
        Charge of SIS, the department with world-wide connections to the
        CIA, ASIO, FBI and Interpol! </p>
      <p>I had meanwhile, designed a bigger proving machine and had
        placed orders overseas for magnets and devices for pulsing
        equipment. Time went by, well beyond expected delivery dates,
        with no sign of the devices, nor any correspondence pertaining
        to my orders to any of the electrical companies. </p>
      <p>I lodged person-to-person calls to the people who originally
        signed the confirming correspondence to me, to be told that
        "that person in no longer with us and we cannot help you any
        more." </p>
      <p>Muldoon had by now, committed the whole country to the New
        Plymouth Power Station, Huntly Power Station, Marsden Oil
        Refinery, etc etc. The Government signalled its intentions that
        is was in no way going to let a little outsider like me come
        into the act with a revolutionary machine capable of countering
        the so-called energy crisis. </p>
      <p>Muldoon at this stage, had me well taped up so to speak, My
        phone, I was informed, was tapped, my mail was intercepted and I
        was kept under observation. </p>
      <p>I held a number of meetings with the Chief Post Office
        Investigating Officer regarding the matter of mail disappearance
        and interception, with the same negative and unsatisfactory
        answers and results as from other Government departments. After
        the lapse of several months, the machine was finally evaluated
        by DSIR. </p>
      <p>I must mention here an interesting fact regarding the
        evaluation of my machine by the DSIR. It happens that a certain
        electrical engineer that I was involved with, who incidentally,
        also evaluated my machine, informed me that the person
        designated the role of evaluating my machine in DSIR, was in
        fact a mechanical engineer with no background, knowledge, nor
        qualifications of any description pertaining to electrical or
        electronic engineering, and further that the Auckland Division
        did not posses a member on the staff qualified to undertake such
        a project. This person none-the-less did do the evaluation and
        indeed signed the test results. </p>
      <p>(You may well wonder how did this independent electrical
        engineer have such inside information on the DSIR? Well, it so
        happened that he himself had been their one and only electrical
        engineer in the Auckland Division, and I might add, a specialist
        on electrical motors too.) </p>
      <p>That an unqualified person was assigned the task of evaluating
        the possibilities of a revolutionary motor is further evidence
        to me of conspiracy. </p>
      <p>DSIR Evaluation - 5.8% efficiency&nbsp; ~&nbsp; Lucas
        Industries Evaluation - 100% efficiency! </p>
      <p>Other independent eminent engineers' findings, including those
        of the ex-electrical engineer from DSIR varied from 96.93% to
        100% efficiency! </p>
      <p>At this stage, I had unwittingly invited the then chief
        departmental district electrical engineer to be present at my
        laboratory to witness the phenomenon of one particular model
        displaying identical input and output wave forms on a twin beam
        oscilloscope with the machine windings running at ambient
        temperature, a condition which cannot be denied as proof of 100%
        efficiency, without any further tests being required. </p>
      <p>He conceded there was no doubt whatever what he was witnessing
        was real, but like all academics who stick to their ivory tower
        scientific establishment beliefs, he said it could not be done.
      </p>
      <p>Upon reading certain of my writings, it will be found that at
        one time in earlier years, I disbelieved in any kind of
        conspiracy regarding inventions pertaining to energy efficiency,
        and certain communication installations. I must now say, having
        unwittingly got myself into the web of the insidious conspiracy,
        through treading the path of an inventor in the field of free
        energy, that I now know from personal experience the pitfalls,
        stone walls, and blatant obstacles and barriers designed to
        hamper and silence inventors with such devices as energy
        efficient machines. </p>
      <p>I decided to investigate the fate of a number of other
        excellent energy- efficient inventions, and learned that too
        many good inventions were never heard of again. Inventors
        themselves were turning into hermits, meeting with unexplained
        accidents, even totally disappearing. In many cases their
        laboratories were searched and ransacked, equipment confiscated
        and/or destroyed, and even attempts made on their lives. Others
        are frequently bought off in return for silence. </p>
      <p>The conspirators, who are also the cartel operators are
        determined to continue to make mankind use fossil fuel for all
        possible energy requirements and will go to any lengths to
        achieve just that. </p>
      <p>I have since superseded the above machine and have built and
        proven two different types of self-sustaining motor generators
        with efficiency ratings well beyond unity. </p>
      <p><b>Adams Breaks the Gravity Barrier</b> </p>
      <p>Inventor Robert Adams appears to have broken the gravity
        barrier, with his advanced Adams Electric Motor Generator
        operating in a high state of resonance and apparently tapping
        gravitational energy. </p>
      <p>"During the later months of 1992, I derived what I considered
        to be an equation for possibly the ultimate in rotary motor
        generator design. The purpose of this exercise, was to ascertain
        whether further unconventional design features of the machine
        parameters, using this equation, proved certain theories which I
        had previously discussed with Mr. Bruce Cathie, an
        internationally recognized New Zealand researcher in this field.
        (Cathie is the 'father' of grid harmonics) </p>
      <p>Upon applying the 'equation' to the machine parameters and
        testing it, there was no doubt the machine was running in a
        higher state of resonance than previously obtained. </p>
      <p>It had been arranged beforehand between myself and Mr. Cathie
        that, should the results of this test be of some substance, Mr.
        Cathie would travel from Auckland to Whakatane specifically to
        check the machine parameters with his 'harmonic equations'.
        These results confirmed the theory which we had previously
        discussed and planned to implement. </p>
      <p>The results of these first trial tests have been SUPERCEDED,
        with the new figures obtained being found beyond anything that
        is known of in the present- day field of free energy research.
        There is every possibility that these latest figures, also, will
        be surpassed in the near future. </p>
      <p>The equations and how they are applied are hidden within
        certain parameters, and, to this end, it could be said that to
        reach the ultimate in rotary overunity devices is not possible
        without the correct application to all parameters of the machine
        using the 'Adams Pulse Method' and the Adams-Cathie equations. </p>
      <p>The above methods and results give us a valuable lead in the
        realm of solid-state gravitational energy research. The
        equations and methods of application in design procedures,
        however, remain, at this stage, secret. The efficiency figures
        possible from the device are such that they simply cannot be
        published. </p>
      <p>I wish readers to refer further to the following discussions on
        Wilhelm Muller and Dr. Rolf Schaffranke, the general content of
        which relates to my discovery of the mysteries of magnetism some
        twenty-four years ago." </p>
      <p><b>The Adams Pulsed Electric Motor Generator: On Wilhelm Muller</b>
      </p>
      <p>Reference to an article authored by Tom Valentine, California
        based freelance journalist, in regard to claims by Wilhelm
        Muller and his magnet manufacturers. </p>
      <p>I must take Muller and his magnet manufacturers to task on
        their statement that "magnets can do a tremendous amount of
        work" --- this is not so. In an over-unity rotary machine, the
        magnets are 'assisting' to run the machine, but they are not
        generating the extra energy beyond the reaching of 100%
        efficiency. The magnets are not doing actual work, as such,
        beyond that point. </p>
      <p>It is likely Muller's machine is operating, according to the
        efficiency figure Muller quoted, somewhere on the near lower end
        of a positive resonance curve. From the generally known
        information on his device, this would be the likely area in
        which it is operating. If this is so, then the chances of
        greater efficiency are slim, particularly on account of it
        appearing to be operating in a positive mode. For the rotor
        magnets to operate as a gate to harness gravitational energy
        beyond unity, it must be in a negatively resonant mode and not
        operating in a closed magnetic circuit system. </p>
      <p>Bruce Cathie and I spent an entire day together in January 1993
        going over his harmonic equations in regard to my advanced
        machine, and confirmed that it was running in an advanced state
        of resonance, harnessing gravitational energy and demonstrating
        evidence of the magnets forming a 'gate' to harness one
        half-cycle of the gravitational pulse, but doing no actual work
        over and above the 100%. </p>
      <p>In regard to another claim by Muller that he had to use
        powerful neodymium magnets, this also is contrary to our
        findings. It matters not whether you use standard off-the-shelf
        'alnico' magnets or powerful magnets, the results are no
        different. It is not necessary to use powerful magnets to prove
        if a machine can be constructed with over unity capability. This
        fact has been shown repeatedly with the Adams machines, using
        small and weak magnets. </p>
      <p>The inference also that Nikola Tesla might have required
        today's advanced magnetic materials to achieve over unity
        results, is also totally wrong. The only difference between
        using ordinary magnets like 'alnico' and, for instance,
        'samarium cobalt', is that you get greater energy output from
        the stronger magnets by way of their ability to detect and
        amplify this energy on a greater scale; and, therefore, upon
        utilizing the Adams pulsing system, you can have a device using
        any ordinary magnets capable of not only 100% efficiency, but
        also of being tuned into operating as a gate in detecting and
        delivering gravitational energy. </p>
      <p>As for the establishment's texts stating that "magnets do NO
        real work", the establishment, for once, is correct. It is,
        however, interesting to note that this is a very 'convenient'
        fact for the establishment to expound upon - there could be an
        underlying inference here that magnets are useless for machines
        designed to achieve beyond unity results. </p>
      <p>Permanent magnets and their place in science today need to be
        more fully understood." </p>
      <p><b>On Dr. Rolf Schaffranke</b> </p>
      <p>"Reference to an article written by Dr. Schaffranke in THE
        MANUAL OF FREE ENERGY DEVICES AND SYSTEMS, VOLUME TWO, published
        by D.A. Kelly, in which on page 7, paragraphs 7 and 12, Dr.
        Schaffranke erroneously maintains it is NECESSARY to use super
        magnets to tap gravitational energy. </p>
      <p>I found that my original 1970 open magnetic circuit motor
        generator is superior to my 1976 closed magnetic circuit model
        in regard to the results of obtaining and maintaining a correct
        harmonic vacuum oscillation and so tapping gravitational energy
        during one half-cycle of the gravitational pulse wave. </p>
      <p>People who make such claims regarding the use of super magnets,
        obviously have little or no experience in the realms of rotary
        free-energy devices using permanent magnets. Over twenty years
        ago, I proved that even tiny weak magnets bought off the shelf
        and incorporated into my machines yielded efficiency into the
        hundreds of per cent over unity. </p>
      <p>A permanent magnet is an entity unto itself. It is no different
        in any way whatsoever from its brothers made of different
        materials; it is still a permanent magnet irrespective of its
        gauss rating. </p>
      <p>These claims are tantamount to saying that you can get more
        than 2.2 volts out of a lead acid cell simply by increasing its
        ampere hour rating, or conversely, you use a ten horsepower
        motor to run a machine that only requires one horsepower. </p>
      <p>I reiterate: the sooner science rejects conventionalism, the
        better for humankind. </p>
      <p>If indeed magnets were doing a tremendous amount of work, they
        certainly would not last long in any machine. There are secrets
        and mysteries surrounding magnets and collapsing field energies,
        and only after exhaustive studies of these two phenomena in
        practice, do these mysteries unravel themselves and emerge in
        their glory, and, correctly applied through the use of the
        required mathematics, pave the way to tapping gravitational
        energy in astronomical quantity. </p>
      <p>For high-power rotary machines, however, super magnets are the
        obvious choice, for reasons of higher power capabilities,
        reduced weight and volume. When installed in an 'Adams' machine,
        these super magnets enable the opening up of clearances between
        rotor and stator without appreciable loss due to the high
        overall efficiency of this machine. </p>
      <p>If indeed it were possible to induce magnets to do a tremendous
        amount of work, as claimed by the aforementioned people, then I
        claim that the magnets must first have very substantial energy
        imparted to them to undertake the task ahead. Secondly, when
        reaching this 'tremendous' state, they would start heating up
        and continue to do so until they reach the point whereby their
        magnetism would begin disintegrating, and continue to do so
        until the machine would eventually come to a halt, unable to
        start again. </p>
      <p>There are a lot of people out there striving for the ultimate
        in rotary electrical machines. They all have my personal
        blessings for their endeavors, but may I hasten to add for those
        who make such claims, that they exhibit a lack of experience and
        knowledge of the capabilities of permanent magnets in rotary
        electrical machines. </p>
      <p>But don't be disappointed, readers, as I assure you that
        permanent magnets are indeed the answer to free energy.
        Correctly adapted to a rotary machine they are the 'gateway' to
        harnessing gravitational energy. </p>
      <p>With the application of the 'Adams resonant pulse frequency
        equation' and the 'Cathie harmonic equations' combined with the
        'Adams Pulsed EMG System', incredible energies can be very
        easily and cleanly made available. </p>
      <p>I wish to state to all readers at this particular stage, that I
        have only, in the past year, made the decision to publish
        certain aspects from my twenty years work in the field of free
        energy research. </p>
      <p>There are no doubt many other researchers who, for various
        reasons such as lack of finance, fear, suppression and very many
        other barriers, have not had even a chance to be heard. It is to
        be hoped the day will soon arrive when all can benefit from our
        work." </p>
      <p><b>The Adams Pulsed Electric Motor Generator (January 1993)</b>

      <div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; <br>
        An explanation to readers on matters pertaining to hysteresis
        loss, eddy current loss, magnetic drag. Also some advice
        regarding further information required from enquiries received
        to date by interested parties:</div>
      <div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; <br>
        I would first like to state that it has been made clear that
        this machine has been proven to be capable of over-unity
        performance, plus the fact that it has proven itself capable of
        returning energy to its supply source. So we now come to the
        matters mentioned above.
        <p>If a machine is to run at unity or better, it must first
          'overcome' those problems found in the conventional machine,
          which, of course, are principally those of magnetic drag,
          hysteresis loss and eddy currents, all of which waste energy
          in heat and hence require a cooling fan - with its attendant
          losses as well.</p>
      </div>
      <div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; <br>
        As explained previously, the Adams machine runs cool in
        comparison to the conventional machine and does not, therefore,
        require a cooling fan. Now these factors surely speak for
        themselves. It must also be borne in mind by the reader that in
        the conventional AC or DC machine, the internal heat of windings
        and stators reach boiling point within fifteen minutes. The
        Adams machine does not have this problem.</div>
      <div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; <br>
        Given these salient factors, which in themselves are a starting
        point for those of you who are forward-thinking, I feel I have
        provided sufficient hints, information and guidance to enable
        those astute enough to realize the potentiality of the
        principles given, to build a machine for themselves according to
        their own leanings as well as along the lines of the Adams
        machine.</div>
      <div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; <br>
        Most of you know of the manual which has been published and
        distributed by NEXUS Magazine. My purpose in compiling this
        manual is to give those interested an insight into the
        principles of the mysteries of my machine, and I expect those
        interested, patient and persevering enough to accept that they
        must work out and work with these mysteries and to, like myself,
        to battle to get there. Only then will true understanding and
        enlightenment reveal itself and true reward, however slowly, be
        theirs.
        <p>Notwithstanding these statements however, I submit here a few
          further valuable recommendations for readers, and as time
          progresses, and as time permits, some further such tidbits of
          information will be drip-fed through NEXUS as a form of
          encouragement to all concerned.</p>
      </div>
      <div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; <br>
        I would like to inform readers at this point in time that,
        because of the steady flow of response I have had since
        publication in NEXUS, by enthusiasts, interested parties and
        investors alike, it is no longer possible to address enquiries
        of the nature of those above individually, other than on a
        consultancy basis. Although I will continue to contribute
        certain articles to NEXUS as long as I am able, and will
        continue to personally reply to all mail, I ask readers to
        kindly understand that a good deal of my time is involved in
        consultancy already on my advanced projects, so my free time is
        somewhat limited. I encourage readers to keep their eyes on
        NEXUS as I intend to remain as loyal to them as they are to me.</div>
      <div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; <br>
        Here, then, are those few further recommendations to readers. If
        contemplating the construction of a proving machine, note as
        follows :</div>
      <div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; <br>
        (1) Don't purchase expensive powerful 'neodymium' or 'samarium
        cobalt' magnets&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; without first having
        experience with cheap easy-to-get 'alnico' magnets, for if you
        commence with powerful magnets you will find yourself facing
        powerful problems. Using powerful magnets will not prove
        anything beyond what alnico will do. However, given this, if you
        feel you MUST choose powerful magnets, for whatever your
        reasons, take heed -great care is required in the handling of
        them to preclude personal injury.</div>
      <div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; <br>
        (2) For a proving machine do not use less than 10 ohms each for
        two stators at 180 degrees apart; recommend series mode for
        first attempt. Don't be concerned about start windings initially
        and, remember, what can be achieved MICROscopically can be
        achieved MACROscopically and so I strongly suggest - walk before
        you run.</div>
      <div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; <br>
        (3) Should you experience any difficulty in designing and
        constructing the tapered disc contactor (machining, etc.) then
        use electronic switching, i.e. photo, Hall effect, or inductor
        effect, with switching current transistor, etc. The machine,
        correctly constructed, should still deliver a minimum 107%
        efficiency. The charging effect will, of course, be lost, and
        the input current to supply the electronic switching will raise
        the total input quite steeply. The point to be made here is that
        in using electronic switching, in a larger machine, the degree
        of loss due to this use of electronic switching is negligible.</div>
      <div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; <br>
        However, for those who are seeking greater efficiency figures,
        it is advised to stay with the tapered disc contactor method and
        build a small wattage unit, i.e. 0.25 to 1 watt. This is the
        area of power rating within which you will gain quicker and
        better results which, in turn, will provide the necessary
        experience for designing and building a larger unit.</div>
      <div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; <br>
        Once again the inventor cannot stress the importance enough, for
        those who wish to construct a successful device, to start at the
        bottom rung and listen to what the device is saying to you as
        you go along.</div>
      <div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; <br>
        <b>Note for the Curious</b></div>
      <p><br>
        I have received a lot of requests regarding an explanation
        accounting for such low temperature operation on full load. This
        one fact alone is indisputable evidence of a very high
        efficiency rating. </p>
      <div style="text-align: left;">I have therefore decided to make up
        a set of drawings which will explain to the reader the questions
        regarding hysteresis, eddy current and magnetic drag losses, as
        well as temperature ratings, etc.</div>
      <div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; <br>
        These drawings will be accompanied with written explanations
        concerning the 'how'and 'why' of certain factors.</div>
      <div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; <br>
        These drawings and their accompanying information will be
        available directly from the inventor at the address given below
        at a cost of NZ $20.00 including postage.</div>
      <div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; <br>
        Meanwhile, for further information on the 'Adams and Cathie'
        projects, you'll find it all in your future issues of NEXUS."</div>

        The Adams machine was quite the topic of discussion at the April
        1993 ISNE conference in Denver. It was first broken to the
        public attention by NEXUS magazine, published in Australia... </p>
      <p>As to the ADAMS motor, I am a bit puzzled with the comments
        that gravitational energy is somehow used in the machine. From
        my admittedly limited understanding, it simply appears that he
        is using the back EMF to give additional thrust and thus a much
        higher efficiency. </p>
      <p>With the use of the back EMF, there would be little if any
        hysteresis from the "collision" of the forward EMF with the back
        EMF and thus the reduction in heating. </p>
      <p>We at KeelyNet would greatly appreciate reports from anyone
        reading this who might choose to build or otherwise experiment
        with the principle. You may upload as a text file or send a
        photo copy to the Vanguard Sciences address at the top of the

          Motor/Generator</i> </p>
      <p>Hello all: I am new to this echo area and I am not sure if
        anyone has discussed this topic before. </p>
      <p>I have obtained plans for constructing a motor/generator from a
        Mr. Robert Adams in New Zealand and I have begun construction. </p>
      <p>Seven people have since built this device in Australia and it
        seems to work fine, but no-one can explain the efficiency
        anomaly that occurs after about 15 minutes of running time. In
        the two that I have personally seen, the eff. rating jumps from
        85% (normal) then after about 15 mins goes to around 120%. </p>
      <p>We have set up oscilloscopes, amp meters, volt meters, temp
        meters and can't account for the increase. </p>
      <p>We do not have access to a magnamonitor to measure the magnetic
        field on the rotor, but we are still stumped. </p>
      <p>Any ideas ? My intention is for it to be a Battery Charger. </p>

        There are some peculiar activities that have happened with
        regard to the Adams motor. As you can see from the above email,
        these fellows claim to know of 7 people who have successfully
        replicated the Adams motor. </p>
      <p>In 1993, everyone was hot for it, wanting plans and such.
        Within a very short period, there was a business arrangement
        made with Adams which we heard was to produce a UNITY motor to
        be patented and sold in the U.K. </p>
      <p>Sometime toward the end of 1993, the talk was that the Adams
        motor had not proven out, that no one had successfully
        duplicated the effect or there was some anomaly in the
        measurement method. A very bizarre turnaround if you read the
        above email. </p>
      <p>At the 1994 ISNE meeting, Bill McMurtry of New Zealand gave a
        presentation in which he said flat out that the Adams motor did
        not work. We took Bill to dinner with Tom Bearden and Ken
        McNeil, but did not have an opportunity to speak with him in
        detail because he and Ken had some items to discuss in private.
      </p>
      <p>The collaboration of Adams with Bruce Cathie had increased the
        over unity output to numbers that were so incredible as to
        warrant not publishing them. I read something about it being on
        the order of 1:3000. At any rate, the Adams motor is far from
        dead if there have been independent successes. </p>

          <br>
          <b>by Harold Aspden</b></p>
      </div>
      I first heard of Robert Adams and his motor at a mountain retreat
      west of Denver, Colorado during the days just before a New Energy
      Symposium. That was in April 1993. A benefactor [Bill &amp; Lynda
      Beierwalts] interested in knowing the truths about "free energy"
      and its potential for solving the world's pollution problems had
      funded the expenses of the invited speakers and the preliminary
      "think tank" event at that retreat. My talk was about magnetism
      and the aether as an energy source, but our "think tank" groups
      each had an allocated theme. We were expected to point the finger
      at the best candidate for onward investigation, from the vague
      information and reports we had about discoveries and claims
      pertaining to the new energy world.
      <p>Yes, there were several to choose from, machines involving
        magnets and solid-state devices such as that devised by Hans
        Coler, dating from the World War II era, or the then-current
        activity of Sparky Sweet (now deceased). In fact, one of our
        team, a colleague from U.K., had visited Sweet just prior to
        that Colorado meeting. However, specific information as to how
        to build any of these devices was not available, nor was there
        any acceptable theoretical account of their operation on which
        we could recommend action. </p>
      <p>Fortunately, however, someone had brought with him information
        publicized by the NEXUS magazine and a Manual, available from
        Nexus, describing a motor devised by a New Zealander named
        Robert Adams. "Over-Unity" performance was claimed and enough
        was disclosed as a blue print for replication of the machine. We
        did not really understand how the motor could operate quite as
        well as Adams had indicated, but we were convinced that
        "over-unity" was in prospect. Accordingly, as it seemed easy to
        build a motor such as Adams described, our group settled for the
        recommendation that the Adams motor should be looked into and
        somehow constructed to verify its performance. </p>
      <p>That was how I first came to know about the Adams motor. </p>
      <p><b>Collaboration with Adams</b> </p>
      <p>At that time such experimental work that I had pursued on the
        "free energy" theme was basically on solid-state magnetic
        systems and, in collaborating with a Scotsman, Scott Strachan, I
        had been involved with the invention of a thermoelectric device
        which was extremely efficient at converting low grade heat into
        electricity. Undoubtedly, it defied the Second Law of
        Thermodynamics, but that point was not stressed in those early
        days. That invention had proved problematic because the devices
        built worked for a while by repeated operation for half an hour
        or so at a time, day after day, for several months, but then
        came the inevitable progressive weakening in conversion
        efficiency, ending with a defunct piece of equipment. </p>
      <p>The story on that is told between pages 124 and 128 of Jeane
        Manning's excellent book, <i>The Coming Energy Revolution - The
          Search for Free Energy</i>, ISBN 0-89529-713-2 published in
        1996 by Avery Publishing Group, Garden City Park, New York. </p>
      <p>I was distracted from that thermoelectric venture when I took a
        more practical interest in the magnetic reluctance motor,
        inspired by what we had heard about Robert Adams. I was to be
        distracted again towards the end of 1995 when the Correa
        "Abnormal Pulsed Glow Discharge" invention came to my attention,
        with its 5:1 over-unity feature clearly demonstrated. And now,
        as year-end 1996 approaches, I am destined to be distracted
        again, this time by having discovered myself why those
        thermoelectric devices mentioned above had failed. The remedy is
        easy as the problem does not involve deterioration. It is as if
        a bistable system has flipped to its off-state and just needs to
        be flipped back into its on-state, provided, that is, one knows
        what to flip! </p>
      <p>Now, to come to the point about my collaboration with Robert
        Adams, I am writing these words on October 28th, 1996 and in a
        week from now the granted patent I have procured jointly with
        Robert Adams will become available from the British Patent
        Office in its issued form. It is Patent No. GB 2,282,708. I
        plan, in these pages, to introduce my own motor research and
        relate it to that patent and explain my connection with Adams. </p>
      <p>I am also mindful that Adams, now recognized by an honorary
        doctorate from the Open International University of Sri Lanka,
        to become Dr. Robert George Adams, has recently published an
        addendum to the Adams Motor Manual entitled: "The Revelation of
        the Century" and has included in that work some of my written
        contributions. </p>
      <p>The immediate focus of my attention, however, is a rather
        critical letter communication authored by Michio Kaku and sent
        to a programme producer of a radio station based in New York. It
        was dated May 20th 1996, but it is only now that I have become
        aware of this communication from Robert Adams' new book. </p>
      <p>Adams need not have included Kaku's letter in his book, but he
        did and I commend him for it. Apart from saying that Robert
        Adams was either the next Einstein and Newton rolled into one or
        a crackpot, he made these two comments: </p>
      <p>"Apparently, he (Adams) wants to extract energy from the aether
        by using rotating magnets, thereby violating the first law of
        thermodynamics (conservation of mass and energy). This is an
        ancient idea, going back centuries and was most popular in the
        1880s, but was disproved by the Michelson-Morley experiment and
        Einstein's relativity theory. Aether, which was supposed to be a
        magical substance which pervaded the universe, has never been
        measured in our laboratories." </p>
      <p>"The proof is in the pudding. He (Adams) has to show a
        blueprint of his machines, show that they in fact generate
        energy, and show with a few equations how his theory works.
        Lacking a blueprint, a mathematical theory, and, say, video
        tapes of his motors generating energy from nothing, I cannot say
        with 100% certainty that he is wrong. (Only 99.99%)" </p>
      <p>Now, having just had an "over-unity" motor patent granted in
        which I share inventorship with Adams, I will assume that those
        Kaku remarks are addressed also in my direction and reply
        accordingly, point by point. </p>
      <p>Firstly, as a educational exercise, the extraction of energy
        from the aether does not violate the first law of
        thermodynamics. By definition or simple semantics, if you
        extract energy from something and move it from that something,
        A, into something else, B, the energy remains conserved overall.
        The first law of thermodynamics dates from before the time when
        the transmutation of mass and energy was recognized as the
        stellar power source by Sir James Jeans (1904). A critic might
        say, however, as Jeans himself did in his 1928 book EOS, that
        Isaac Newton knew of photosynthesis by which radiant energy
        transmitted through space is captured by plants and convened
        into matter, which stores energy by creating a combustible
        product. The transmutability of energy and mass was not
        discovered, nor was it first suggested, by Einstein. He was too
        late. </p>
      <p>Secondly, the existence of the aether was not disproved by
        Einstein. Indeed, Einstein has not proved anything, nor has he
        disproved anything. One simply cannot flaunt Einstein's theory
        around as a reason for rejecting the prospect of an "over-unity"
        motor. On the contrary, ask yourself why there are plans to test
        Einstein's theory at a cost of $500,000,000 dollars by launching
        Gravity Probe B in 1999. If Einstein's theory is right, why are
        there any doubts warranting expenditure on that scale? </p>
      <p>Thirdly, Kaku says the aether has never been measured in our
        laboratories and that its existence was disproved by the
        Michelson-Morley Experiment. The fact is that Michelson did not
        perform the experiment to test or refute the existence of the
        aether. He lived another 44 years after performing that
        experiment and believed in the aether to his dying day. He was
        trying to sense the Earth's motion through the aether, but,
        since standing waves developed by mirror reflection had not been
        discovered when the experiment was planned, he had not allowed
        for that to affect the result observed. In fact, the aether
        energy stored in those standing waves, being trapped in the
        mirror system, makes the wave motion appear to be locked to the
        frame of reference of the mirrors, and not the aether as
        expected. The aether certainly was detected in the laboratory
        when Michelson found he could detect the Earth's rotation
        relative to that non-rotating aether by his light wave
        interference experiments jointly with Gale in 1925. </p>
      <p>The aether was detected some years earlier by Sagnac in France
        and is detected in modern navigation technology by the ring
        laser gyro. How can the speed of a laser beam traveling around a
        closed path inside an optical instrument detect rotation of that
        instrument if the beam is not keeping a fixed speed relative to
        something inside that instrument that does not share its
        rotation? That something is the aether! No amount of book
        learning or mathematics can avoid that simple truth, and even
        though the word aether is seen as something magical, it is that
        something that delivers free energy once we have decoded the
        combination of the magnetic lock which restrains its release.
        Note also, that the aether reveals its existence when we have
        rotation and we have rotation in the Adams motor. </p>
      <p>Fourthly, as to Kaku's pudding, which comes first, the chicken
        or the egg, the blueprint and the working machine, or the theory
        and the equations? Though we have no answer to this question of
        priority, we know there are chickens and we know there are eggs,
        so it really does not matter which comes first. Certainly, it
        seems, that in order for Kaku to decide whether free energy is
        possible, albeit with only 0.01% chance, there has to be a
        theory, a machine and an aether. </p>
      <p>It is for this very reason that I have made special effort
        during 1996 and published my book Aether Science Papers as a
        forerunner of the Energy Science Report describing my own "free
        energy" motor research. This Report No. 9 in the series is
        entitled Over-Unity Motor Design and its date of publication is
        November 6th 1996, two days before the first disclosure of
        details of my machine at a New Energy symposium held in
        Rotterdam in The Netherlands. </p>
      <p>The formal electrical engineering theory explaining the motor
        operation in tapping "free energy" is contained in a few pages
        in the Energy Science Report #9. The motor design is described
        and a photograph of the machine is included. Moreover there is
        an outline blueprint that indicates the design of the
        multi-megawatt versions of the machine. However, as to the
        ether, or 'aether,' to use my normal terminology, describing
        that in full detail needs more than a few pages for scientific
        proof and, as Kaku well realizes, the wisdom needed exceeds the
        talents of even an Einstein or a Newton. </p>
      <p><b>About the Aether</b> </p>
      <p>I will digress here, just for a moment, before getting back to
        Robert Adams and the subject of the Adams-Aspden patent. My
        reason is another comment made by Kaku in that quoted
        communication. He asserted as a conclusion: </p>
      <p>"Inventors want to solicit money from investors, so I have a
        moral obligation to say exactly what I think about issues that,
        at some point, may hurt people." </p>
      <p>Now that is a very poor reason for attacking someone's lifelong
        efforts to probe the secrets of science with a view to advancing
        both knowledge and technology beneficial to mankind. The facts
        of life are that it is investors who want to solicit money by
        making profit from the creative endeavors of inventors.
        Invariably, inventors get hurt anyway, without some well-meaning
        individual doing his moral duty by hurting the inventor more by
        unwarranted criticism. Is it really a moral obligation to preach
        the gospel of Einstein's theory in contending that investors
        should steer clear of Robert Adams, when his only thought is to
        have his efforts recognized? </p>
      <p>Of course, by the nature of things, the free-lance inventor can
        go adrift in a technical sense and then, if ensnared by those
        investors, he can be carried off into obscurity by a tidal wave
        of turmoil. Meanwhile the orthodox scientific establishment
        stands by and watches, mildly amused at the futile efforts of
        the free-lance inventor who ventures beyond the level of
        gimmicks for use in the household and garden. That is the way it
        is. </p>
      <p>As to my book Aether Science Papers, it shows how so much of
        vital importance, explained by neither Einstein's theory nor
        quantum theory, has a straightforward answer. Just as Robert
        Adams in New Zealand and I in England sit poles apart on this
        our Earth, yet we are governed by the same laws of physics and
        subject to the same constants of physics. Body Earth is our
        common rotating frame of reference, but body Earth does not
        explain why those physical constants are, so far we know,
        universal. We take that for granted, just as our forebears took
        for granted the fact that they all inhabited the same aether.
        Our modernist society and its Einstein enthusiasts tell us there
        is no aether and so, Robert, you are on your own and only God
        can tell you why your experiments would work as well in England
        as they do in New Zealand! </p>
      <p>You might then wonder why scientists at the U.S. Bureau of
        Standards, at the National Physical Laboratory in England and at
        the equivalent CSIRO National Measurement Laboratory in
        Australia bother to measure the same physical constants to very
        high precision. Give or take a fraction of a part in a million
        attributable to experimental error, they always come out the
        same. Surely, that is because the aether spreads through all
        those locations and has the same structure everywhere. What do I
        mean by structure? Well, you need to look up the paper in
        Physics Letters, 41A, 423-424 (1972), entitled "Aether Theory
        and the Fine Structure Constant" to find the answer. That paper
        emerged from the Australian CSIRO laboratory just mentioned. It
        shows how alpha, the most basic dimensionless constant in
        quantum theory, is derived by aether theory to give: </p>
      <p>1/alpha = 108 Pi SQRT(2) N**(-1/6) </p>
      <p>and how N is found to have the lowest cell energy if N is 1843.
        This gives 1/a;pha as 137.0359, correct to part per million
        precision in comparison with its measurement at any of those
        laboratories. If there were no aether, then you might as well
        think of a number and try that, though it would be your ghost
        that makes that effort because you would no longer exist. </p>
      <p>Of course, there will be the Kaku's of this world who say that
        the above formula is mere number play, contrived to fit known
        results. Well, that may be true for Einstein's "1,2,3" theory,
        but it certainly is untrue for the aether theory. You see, all
        Einstein did by the disguised mathematics of his General Theory
        of Relativity was to say (1) that the spectral redshift was the
        same as that evident by use of Newtonian theory, given that
        energy gravitates, (2) that light beams grazing past stars are
        deflected by twice the amount expected from Newtonian theory and
        (3) that planets describe orbits around the sun as if the
        planet's motion-dependent attraction is three times stronger
        than the value predicted by classical theory. It is so easy to
        contrive a theory for a 2 and a 3 factor. A German schoolmaster
        Paul Gerber had, in 1898, 18 years ahead of Einstein, presented
        a theory for the '3' factor, based on the speed-of-light
        propagation of gravity across space, but that was not mentioned
        by Einstein. The factor of 3 arises because the energy transfer
        between sun and planet is not confined to a pencil thin line
        drawn between sun and planet, but rather fans out as it
        transfers to the aether field and then converges on its target
        after taking more time over the longer route. </p>
      <p>Einstein's theory is sterile. It offers no physical insight
        into the truths of the role played by the aether. It cannot
        explain the 137.0359 that governs quantum theory and, even on
        its own territory, it cannot explain the dimensionless constant
        involving G, the constant of gravity, nor, indeed, can it
        explain the unifying link between electrodynamics and
        gravitation! </p>
      <p>So, Robert out there in New Zealand, take note that you are in
        a part of the universe where the aether has the energy state
        corresponding to N having the value 1843! Note that I first
        discovered the formula long ago in the 1950s using an engineer's
        slide rule, backed up by logarithmic tables for higher
        precision. </p>
      <p>Take further note that, years after that 1972 paper was
        published, a famous astronomer in USA (Tifft), discovered that
        distant galaxies closely paired or in small groups exhibited
        differences in red shift. The differences were always multiples
        of 72.5 km/s in relation to the speed of light. Explaining this
        is a complete mystery. Why should Planck's radiation constant be
        different from one galaxy to the next? Well, if you, the reader,
        were to study my aether theory, you could work out that, since
        aether energy density throughout space has to be uniform on a
        universal scale, the spectral emission frequency of a radiating
        atom will vary in proportion to N**(4/9). It varies as alpha**2
        and also by a further cube root of this factor, which gives the
        power 4/9. </p>
      <p>Now take 1843 as the base value of N and decrease it in steps
        as you look for higher energy per unit cell states in different
        galactic regions. You will find that the result is the 72.5 km/s
        observed by Tifft. Check that by calculating 4c/9N as N
        decreases from 1843 to 1828, c being the speed of light. Check
        the Tifft paper to verify what I say: W.G. Tifft, Astronomical
        Journal, 211, 31-46 (1977). You will see his comment that he
        could find no evidence of gravitational interaction between
        those adjacent galaxies! So, what has happened to Einstein's
        theory. It requires universal gravitation with each of you being
        an individual observer at the center of your own universe. I
        would rather believe in the aether, knowing that there is proof
        of its reality, and devote my efforts to tapping some of its
        store of energy to safeguard the future of mankind from
        unnecessary pollution. </p>
      <p><b>The Adams Motor and the Adams-Aspden Patent</b> </p>
      <p>I have not built an Adams motor as described in his Manual. I
        do know that when I returned to Denver in May 1994 for the New
        Energy Symposium there were machines on show or described in the
        Proceedings which purported to be Adams motors but they did not
        perform over-unity. It was reported that one such machine came
        very close to being 100% efficient. Adams did not attend that
        meeting. However, in the intervening year I had struck up a
        contact with Adams. I found he was under the impression that
        such machines are unpatentable and I had skills in the patent
        field as well as knowledge about the physics governing the
        operation of motors and magnetism generally. In fact, I already
        had a granted US patent for a motor designed for over-unity
        operation, but never built [US Patent 4,975,608]. Adams had
        possession of motors which he claimed had the over-unity
        performance. I had, at the Denver 1993 meeting, declared my
        belief that over-unity motors were possible and supported the
        plan to explore the Adams machine. </p>
      <p>My distant association with Adams resulted in an exchange of
        technical information and the proposal to adapt the design of
        his motor in a novel way. His motor had open-ended magnetic
        stators and magnets in a single plane forming radial arms. The
        invention, we jointly devised, placed the magnets axially
        parallel with the rotor shaft, fitted two sets of toothed rotor
        pieces and made the stators into bridging yokes. The resulting
        configuration was of the form shown in Fig. 1, taken from the
        patent specification that we filed in U.K. </p>
      <p>The machine has to work over-unity, if properly designed,
        because the magnetic flux switching assures that much of the
        flux across the pole gaps is diverted, as the poles separate, so
        that it still links the magnetizing windings but finds a return
        closure path sideways from the rotor pieces and so exerts no
        braking action on the motor. The magnets provide the drive
        torque pulling the poles into register when no current is
        applied to the windings. </p>
      <p>Fig. 1. (shows the components, numbers 12 - 18) </p>
      <p>The input of current drives the flux from the stator bridging
        yokes and forces it into the lateral route as the poles
        separate. </p>
      <p>There can be no input of inductive power by the magnetizing
        winding if there is no change of net flux linkage. It will
        change to some degree but, if the design were perfect, then the
        machine could run on negligible inductive power input. That
        leaves normal resistance loss and some magnetization loss, much
        of which can be reduced by making the machine larger and more
        powerful. A small machine could prove the principle, especially
        if we allowed for the heat generated in the windings and
        explored the overall energy situation to see if we really are
        tapping energy from the aether. </p>
      <p>The patent application was filed on 30th September 1993. I
        named myself and Adams as joint applicants and joint inventors.
        It has now been granted, as already stated. However, in May
        1994, during the early days of its patent pendency, I
        encountered the reaction of those in Denver who had been unable
        to confirm "over-unity" operability of the Adams motor. I saw
        our patent application as offering an improved design, but there
        were clouds developing and Adams was facing the problem of
        defending his position. As background also there was the rumor
        about rival Japanese motors and, as things developed, I heard of
        claims for a machine constructed in Hawaii that indicated
        over-unity operation and could, for all I knew, be quite similar
        to the one covered by the Adams-Aspden patent application. </p>
      <p>I was not too sure how Robert Adams was measuring his energy
        input and his energy output, so I could not vouch for his
        performance claims and, indeed, Robert was careful about the
        information he did disclose. When I heard he was adopting
        calorific measurement to verify the output energy, which would
        include heat generated in windings as well as magnetization
        loss, then 1 felt we were on track towards confirming the
        performance rating. I still wonder about the measurement of
        input power, having regard to the pulsed form of the current,
        and I am not reassured by the reference to the communication
        from the Group Research Center of Joseph Lucas Ltd which Robert
        includes in his new book <i>The Revelation of the Century</i>.
      </p>
      <p>That said, however, going back to that 1994 period, I felt I
        had to take more initiative myself and so I decided to ask the
        U.K. Department of Trade and Industry to consider my application
        in a competition for an award of research funding based on a
        meritorious invention proposal. I offered something new, based
        on a new patent application, and backed by the patent cover I
        already had from my U.K. patent corresponding to the US patent
        already mentioned. In August 1994, though I was 66 years of age,
        I won that award and had 75% of research costs covered by the
        U.K. government. In the event that funding carried my motor
        research through to year-end 1995. </p>
      <p>I did not build the specific form of machine shown in Fig. 1,
        but instead constructed a motor that was designed to contain the
        magnetic flux more effectively within what became a single all
        embracing magnetizing winding enclosing the whole motor. This is
        the basis of my own initiative on the "over-unity" machine and,
        as the U.K. patent specification on this new machine is to be
        published early in December 1996, I am now releasing information
        by publication on November 6th of my Energy Science Report No. 9
        entitled "Power from Magnetism: Over-Unity Motor Design." Figure
        12 of that Report, backed by design detail, shows how the
        over-unity factor is determined and I reproduce that figure
        below as Fig. 2. </p>
      <p>Fig. 2 (Plot of B vs. H) </p>
      <p>Without going into full details, note that the diagram is an
        idealization of a B-H magnetization curve. It has a linear B-H
        relationship drawn through the origin O but at high flux density
        levels the curve bends over as it creeps towards saturation and
        the slope of the curve drops. The areas a, b, c and d,
        respectively, represent energy density input in energizing the
        magnetic system. The areas a and b apply for low flux range
        magnetization over the lower part of the curve. The areas c and
        d apply to flux changes confined to the upper region. Areas a
        and c are energy inputs from the magnetizing winding, whereas c
        and d are energy inputs that electrical engineers never
        consider, because that energy is supplied by the aether. </p>
      <p>Where does the energy go? That is an interesting question fully
        explained in my Report, but the answer, simply, is that it is
        pooled by being shared equally between the space occupied by the
        ferromagnetic core and the space taken up by the air gaps in the
        core. That energy in the air gaps, or pole gaps in the motor,
        provides the mechanical drive. </p>
      <p>So, you can see for yourself that, if you run the motor over
        the lower flux density range, which is normal, then you operate
        at an efficiency which cannot exceed (a+b)/2a, which is 100%. On
        the other hand, if the motor operates over the higher range, the
        efficiency can reach up to (c+d)/2c, which is very much higher
        than 100%! </p>
      <p>Consider some realistic figures by putting the knee in the
        curve at 15,000 gauss and assuming that the incremental B/H
        ratio is 1000 over the lower range but only 50 over the upper
        range. Operate the stator core of the motor up to a B value of
        20,000. H ranges from 15 to 115 over this upper range. Work out
        the area c as being (15 + 115) x 5000/2 or 325,000 and the area
        d as being (15,000 + 20,000) x 100/2 or 1,750,000. You will then
        see that operation close to 319% efficiency is indicated! </p>
      <p>Be less ambitious in power output terms and run the motor over
        an upper range between 15,000 and 17,000 gauss, to find that
        area c is (15 + 55) x 2000/2 or 70,000 and the area d is (15,000
        + 17,000) x 40/2 which is 640,000. (c+d)/2c is then 507%! </p>
      <p>If the aether delivers energy on loan to you and you use it to
        run the motor as the poles come together but refuse to give it
        back, then the aether has to replenish itself by taking power
        from its own vast pool of energy activity. It merely ripples to
        find a new level of equilibrium just as the sea will recover if
        you take a bucket of water from it. Eventually, that energy
        borrowed finds its way back to the aether as we spend it by
        generating heat radiation. </p>
      <p>[ <i>Boxed Text:</i> ] "If you do not believe what I say, then
        wait and watch the progress as those who believe, be it Robert
        Adams or whoever, decide to build a magnetic reluctance motor
        heeding the design principlpes I have recorded in my Report." [
        <i>End Boxed Text</i> ] </p>
      <p>As a final note I will echo one message which I have
        independently mentioned in my Report No. 7 (the Report used to
        brief the U.K. Department of Trade and Industry on my Award
        progress). It is that magnetic reluctance motors already being
        manufactured that are said to be 80% or 90% (or even 96%
        efficient as I now see reported on page 21 of the U.K.
        Institution of Mechanical Engineers 16 October 1996 issue of
        Professional Engineering) are already trespassing upon forbidden
        territory. That level of efficiency is either a false claim or
        the motors are already regenerating power from heat dissipated
        as loss. </p>

        "first commercial machine which can power a house from a clean,
        green virtually free energy source." The story has been posted
        on the Aethmogen Technologies: New Energy Scientists website

        Motor/Generator," noted Australian inventor Dr. Robert Adams
        reports background details to enforce his argument that this
        magnetic motor cannot be patented. Adam's writes, "This
        invention, which is mine, was granted a British Patent in 1996
        along with Dr. Harold Aspden of the United Kingdom (IBM's Patent
        Director for 19 years), was placed in the public domain by
        international publication in Nexus Magazine and according to
        International Patent law, thenceforth becomes unpatentable!"

        Seismology and alternative medicine, together with Dr Wilhelm
        Reich's and Dr Ruth Drown's biophysics.</div>

        <i>Interests and Concerns</i> </p>
      <div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; <br>
        Surround the imperative requisite that mankind cease and desist
        confounding the balance of his planet's ecology and focus with
        urgency upon the sources of clean energy which surrounds him at
        all times and is free for the taking. Pollution is now
        unnecessary, as is the wanton destruction of rain forests,
        waterways and our oceans. Concentration on the pollution of the
        human body and a reversal to natural medicine accompanied by a
        sane diet might perhaps be the best first step.</div>
