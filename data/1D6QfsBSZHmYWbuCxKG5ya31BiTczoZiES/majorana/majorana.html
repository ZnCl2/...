      Ettore Majorana; born on 5 August 1906 – probably died after
      1959[1]) was an Italian theoretical physicist who worked on
      neutrino masses. On March 25, 1938, he disappeared under
      mysterious circumstances while going by ship from Palermo to
      Naples. The Majorana equation and Majorana fermions are named
      after him. In 2006, the Majorana Prize was established in his
      memory...<br>

      <br>
      Ettore Majorana was probably the most famous Italian physicist-and
      perhaps not only Italian of the twentieth century. But the name of
      Ettore Majorana, this scientist who died mysteriously in 1938 at
      only 31 years of age, immediately brings to mind a still
      unresolved national enigma: he committed suicide? He took refuge
      in a convent? Or he was kidnapped by foreign powers? Or he walked
      away voluntarily in Argentina?<br>
      <br>
      Because Ettore Majorana, even at a young age, in those years here
      in Italy, had been one of the "via Panisperna boys" the famous
      Italian physicists group headed by Enrico Fermi, ie the Nobel
      prize in 1942 built in Chicago first 'atomic pile' and then,
      unfortunately, he issued the 'bomb'.<br>
      <br>
      Ettore Majorana, who had already refused the transfer prestigious
      invitations at the universities of Cambridge, Yale and Carnegie
      Foundation was noted for its outstanding value as a scientist and
      researcher with theoretical works on nuclear physics and quantum
      mechanics relativistic with particular applications of the theory
      of neutrino.<br>
      <br>
      Majorana obtained a professorship in theoretical physics at the
      age of 28, and was then appointed, out of competition, and for
      special merits, to the holder of the office of Theoretical Physics
      at the University of Naples.<br>
      <br>
      Here he held the inaugural address January 13, 1938 and continued
      his lectures until 23 March. Two days later, March 25, 1938 he
      disappeared after taking -sembra- passport and withdrew the salary
      covered the first months of teaching.<br>
      <br>
      The hypothesis of suicide, the most immediate and plausible, not
      was confirmed in research conducted immediately or was found
      later; the same can be said for other hypotheses advanced over
      time.<br>
      <br>
      The same Fermi wrote to Benito Mussolini to ask an intensification
      of research using clear words that express very well his
      assessment of Majorana: "I do not hesitate to state that you are,
      and I do not say that hyperbolic expression, that of all Italians
      and foreign scholars I had the opportunity to approach the
      Majorana is foremost that to depths of ingenuity struck me most. "<br>
      <br>
      Many, over time, hypothesized in the disappearance a choice of
      total and definitive estrangement.<br>
      <br>
      In some parts of the Majorana work is a "quantum sociology",
      indeterministic, clear example and mirror of the breadth of
      interests such as to place it close to the tradition of the
      "physical-philosophers" as Heisenberg, Bohr and Einstein than to
      the Italian time physical this aspect-oriented experimental.<br>
      <br>
      It was back to publish his works for both his sense hypercritical
      (with himself) both for his shy and reserved nature, so a great
      deal of his research has been in the form of manuscripts, partly
      lost.<br>
      <br>
      What remains of handwritten notes for lectures, his research and
      articles published show a clear example of penetration in the laws
      of physics as to anticipate the times means that Ettore Majorana
      was understood and fully assessed until many years later, and even
      still remains a precursor of scientific innovations.<br>
      <br>
      Now, in the biographical testimony of Rolando Pelizza reported in
      the book "The finger of God", although in this first part is that
      the events until 1989, there is a concrete indication, connected
      to real facts that would otherwise remain unexplained, for a flash
      light on the mystery of the disappearance of this great Italian
      physicist<br>

      <b> </b><br>
      On a strong platform in the high mountains, Rolando Pelizza in
      1976 with a video transmission experiment shows to some
      acquaintances as is capable of annihilating a rock through a small
      machine and claims to use antimatter.<br>
      <br>
      What comes out experiments and laborious negotiations with the
      governments (USA, Italy, Belgium and NATO itself) and the interest
      of these for that invention that our protagonist does not want to
      give in fearing that it may be used for military purposes; hence
      all a disinformation campaign in the media, and misdirection on
      him.<br>
      <br>
      In his biography, he states that the machine built by him is used
      for the experimental verification of nuclear physics theory
      developed by Majorana with which it collaborates.<br>
      <br>
      In many experiments performed, Pelizza get not only the
      possibility of destroying elements with this machine - whose
      peaceful use is the destruction of waste and radioactive waste -
      but above all to be able to obtain large quantities of energy at
      zero cost. In subsequent experiments, Pelizza seeking full
      confirmation of the third phase, which was pointed by his master:
      the transformation of matter. <br>
      <br>
      <b>The story in brief</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      From the first meeting in 1958 with the Master, the physicist
      Ettore Majorana, the idea to build the car he designed, it's been
      only three years. A device able to "annihilate" the matter, an
      invention that brings extraordinary opportunities for development
      for mankind, but also an enormous destructive potential. A machine
      able to literally disappear anything or to create energy at zero
      cost.<br>
      <br>
      And this, only looking at the first two stages of development.<br>
      <br>
      This book tells so the biographical events that happened to
      Rolando Pelizza Brescia from 1958 to 1989, with the sole aim to
      shed light on a discovery of the '70s, which still retains its
      truly revolutionary character.<br>
      <br>
      An outdoor silenced because its inventor did not want to
      compromise with the US secret services, with the Belgian
      government, with the Italian, and others; All interested as they
      were in a development purely military equipment. A scope that, in
      contrast with humanitarian intentions which have always guided
      Pelizza, pushing him to suffer decades of abuse, physical and
      psychological violence, blackmail and intimidation.<br>
      <br>
      They tell the experiments, hopes, joys and defeats of a man and of
      a theory.<br>
      <br>
      It tells of a man who has been able to demonstrate several times
      to the Italian government the effectiveness of its arguments: the
      first time in 1976 to prof. Ezio Clementel CNEL and again in 1981
      to the Minister Mancini. Surprising comments, the consequences
      just as surprising. The stakes were so high as to make change
      players; He needed a new player, stronger, much stronger. Someone
      who was able to get into trouble Rolando, to wage against an
      incredible "machine of the mud", to reduce it to poor and force
      him into exile.<br>
      <br>
      But history teaches us that great men reach their goals in any
      situation. Sometimes even guided only by the case.<br>
      <br>
      The meeting with a Swiss at the end of 1987 IT Pelizza allowed to
      continue its research to try to reach experimentally the third
      phase provided by his Master of theory development: the ability to
      transform matter.<br>
      <br>
      This paper concludes his account just a few days before this
      incredible effort.<br>
      <br>
      All the facts narrated in this book are supported by numerous
      documents and evidence collected over the years.<br>
      <br>
      To believe or not to believe? It does not matter!<br>
      <br>
      The important thing for now is to know. Because it is clear that
      any concerns could be allayed only by experiments carried out
      according to the strictest canons, and that's what we all hope,
      and we are waiting.<br>
      <br>
      Not many great inventors and scholars that history remembers.
      Ettore Majorana and Rolando Pelizza, certainly deserve to get into
      this prestigious group, for a theory and its implementation, for
      an invention that would be able to revolutionize the world,
      although 38 years late! <br>

      <br>
      On the evening of March 25, 1938 Ettore Majorana left Naples with
      a steamer of the company Tirrenia to Palermo, where he stopped a
      couple of days: the journey he had been advised by his closest
      friends, who had invited him to take a rest period.<br>
      <br>
      The same day, before leaving, had written to Connect Antonio
      Carrelli, Professor of Experimental Physics at the Institute of
      Physics, the following missive:<br>
      <br>
      "Dear trucks, I made a decision that was now inevitable. There is
      in it a single grain of selfishness, but I appreciate the trouble
      that my sudden disappearance will procure for you and the
      students. Even for this I beg you to forgive me, but above all for
      letting all the trust, sincere friendship and sympathy you have
      shown me over the months ... Please also remember those who have
      learned to know and appreciate in your Institute; all of whom
      cherish beloved memories at least until eleven tonight, and
      possibly even later. "<br>
      <br>
      Family members had written instead:<br>
      <br>
      "I have only one wish: that no black to dress. If you want to bow
      down to the use, flow rates as well, but for no more than three
      days, some sign of mourning. After remind me, if you can, in your
      hearts and forgive me. "<br>
      <br>
      On March 26 trucks received by Majorana a telegram telling him not
      to worry about what is written in the letter that he had
      previously sent. On the same day it was written and even sent this
      last letter:<br>
      <br>
      Palermo, 26 March 1938 - XVI<br>
      <br>
      "Dear trucks, I hope you have come together with the telegram and
      letter. The sea has refused me and I will return tomorrow to the
      hotel Bologna, perhaps traveling with this same sheet. But I'm
      going to give up teaching. Do not take me for a girl Ibsen because
      the case is different. I'm at your disposal for any further
      details. "<br>
      <br>
      But Ettore Majorana "appeared no more."<br>
      <br>
      "The only certainty among many assumptions involves taking a
      considerable amount of money (some back wages) that Majorana did
      before to cover his tracks, the equivalent of about $ 10,000
      today, as well as the disappearance of his passport . This fact,
      combined with the rationality of Majorana mind, the hypothesis of
      suicide "makes it unlikely ...<br>
      <br>
      It succeeds rather difficult to accept that a person who decides
      to commit suicide, retreats itself the day before his
      "disappearance", by their bank, all their savings, and also
      disappears her passport.<br>
      <br>
      But we proceed with order: "Ettore Majorana was born in Catania
      August 5, 1906, into a wealthy and educated family. The father
      Fabio was a Physicist; uncle Quirino, the favorite of Hector, was
      a well-known scientist in the field of experimental physics. Since
      young Ettore Majorana is considered a young genius, for he had
      exceptional ability to mathematical calculation, that made him
      someone very special and unusual already in those first years of
      your life and then even later. "<br>
      <br>
      "Ettore Majorana initially undertook the engineering studies,
      leaving soon to embrace those of Theoretical Physics under the
      guidance of the great Physicist Enrico Fermi (later Nobel Prize in
      Physics). He then became a member of the so called group of
      physicists Via Panisperna, (named after the street in which it was
      precisely the Institute of Physics of the University of Rome).
      They were part of the group of Via Panisperna names like Edoardo
      Amaldi, Emilio Segre, Rasetti, Oscar D'Agostino and Bruno
      Pontecorvo, who all became famous later in theoretical and
      experimental physics. Inside the "group of boys from Via
      Panisperna", Ettore Majorana occupied immediately a special place
      and important fact was considered by his companions a genius! One
      day shortly after arriving at 'Institute of Physics of Via
      Panisperna, Ettore Majorana gave a demonstration of their
      computing skills also at the same Enrico Fermi, who later called
      Ettore Majorana' Physicist very special, the importance of which
      could be compared only to that of Galileo Galilei and Isaac Newton
      '. "<br>
      <br>
      "Fermi was then working in the statistical model of the atom that
      later took the name of Thomas-Fermi. The speech with Majorana fell
      immediately on ongoing research at the Institute and Fermi quickly
      exposed the general lines of the model, showed Majorana excerpts
      of his recent work on the subject and, in particular, the table in
      which numerical values ​​were collected in the the so-called Fermi
      universal potential. Majorana listened with interest and, after
      asking for some clarification, went off without expressing his
      thoughts and intentions. The next day, in the late morning, showed
      up again at the Institute, he entered directly into the study of
      Fermi and asked, without preamble, see the table that had been
      placed under the eyes for a few moments yesterday. Avutala in
      hand, drew from his pocket a piece of paper on which was written a
      similar chart which he calculated at home in the last twenty-four
      hours. He compared the two tables, and found that they were in
      full agreement with each other, said that the Fermi table was fine
      and left the studio, he left the Institute. Majorana was therefore
      not returned to see if the table was fine by him calculated in the
      last 24 hours, but to check if it was correct that of Fermi. "<br>
      <br>
      This is the portrait that gives it, at that time, Laura Fermi:<br>
      <br>
      "Majorana had, however, a strange character: he was too shy and
      inward looking. In the morning, in going to the Institute tram, he
      began to think of his forehead frowning. He could think of a 'new
      idea, or a difficult problem, or the explanation of certain
      experimental results that had seemed incomprehensible: he rummaged
      his pockets, pulled out a pencil and a pack of cigarettes on which
      to scribble complicated formulas. Fell from the tram was going
      engrossed, his head bowed and a large tuft of hair blacks and
      scarruffati drooping over his eyes. He arrived at the Institute
      tried to Fermi or Rasetti and pack of cigarettes in hand,
      explaining his idea. "<br>
      <br>
      It's still:<br>
      <br>
      "Majorana had continued to attend the Institute of Rome and to
      work there from time to time, in its peculiar way, until in 1933
      he had gone for a few months in Germany. The return did not resume
      his place in the life of the Institute; indeed, he did not want to
      be seen even by old comrades. The turmoil of his character must
      certainly affect a tragic event that struck the Majorana family. A
      baby in swaddling clothes, cousin of Hector, was burned to death
      in the cradle, which had inexplicably caught fire. There was talk
      of crime. He was accused of child and an uncle Hector. The latter
      assumed the responsibility to prove the innocence of his uncle.
      With great decisiveness is also personally involved in the
      process, dealt with lawyers, he took care of the details. The
      uncle was acquitted; but the effort, the constant concern, process
      emotions could not fail to leave a lasting effect on a sensitive
      person who was Hector. "<br>
      <br>
      "Already from 1932 to 1936 Ettore Majorana he had not attended the
      Institute of Via Panisperna. Alone and isolated, always deep in
      thought, one day wrote to his brother Luciano confiding: "At the
      Institute nobody understands anything. My theories may include
      only four people: Bohr, Heisenberg, Dirac and Anderson ... "<br>
      <br>
      "Ettore Majorana was disputed by prestigious universities and
      research institutes. In 1937 Ettore Majorana accepted, after
      refusing Cambridge, Yale and Carnegie Foundation, the chair of
      Professor of Theoretical Physics at the University of Naples,
      where he tied friendship with Antonio Carrelli, professor of
      experimental physics at the Institute of Physics " .<br>
      <br>
      "Ettore Majorana, he worked primarily as a theoretical physicist,
      his most important works included the nuclear physics and
      relativistic quantum mechanics, with particular applications in
      neutrino theory."<br>
      <br>
      "In those years Ettore Majorana becomes the protagonist of a
      series of studies, insights and discoveries that make him one of
      the greatest theoretical physicists of the last century (if not
      the largest). In particular it postulates the 'existence of the
      neutrino, years before it is discovered experimentally. Pioneering
      and important is above all his dell'antiparticella intuition, for
      example. electron / positron (which introduces the theme of
      'existence of' "anti-matter").<br>
      <br>
      And from here it takes the right moves your Free Energy, which I
      want to be baptized: "Free Energy Ettore Mjorana". As we will see
      later, it is a new source of energy, economic, unlimited and
      clean, which already would be available to the 'Humanity!<br>
      <br>
      "In physics, antimatter is the set of anti-particles,
      corresponding to the mass to the particles that make up ordinary
      matter, but with opposite charge. For example an atom of
      "antihydrogen" is composed of a negatively charged antiproton,
      around which orbit a positron (anti-electron) positively charged
      ".<br>
      <br>
      "If the particle and antiparticle come into contact are destroyed,
      emitting high-energy photons (gamma rays) or other
      particle-antiparticle pairs, such that the sum of the total
      energy, the previous and following the impact, remains constant."<br>
      <br>
      "The Majorana studies made a fundamental contribution to the
      development of modern physics and faced many issues in an original
      way: in its first phase published his studies on problems of
      atomic spectroscopy, the chemical bond theory (where he
      demonstrated his deep knowledge of the mechanism exchange of
      valence electrons), the calculation of the probability of the spin
      reversal (spin-flip) of the atoms of a steam polarized beam when
      it moves in a magnetic field rapidly variable. The greatest
      scientific contribution of Ettore Majorana, however, is the second
      phase of its production, which includes three works: the work on
      nuclear forces today called the Majorana, work on arbitrary
      intrinsic momentum particles and work on the symmetry of '
      electron and the positron, is also famous equation Majorana.
      Ettore is remembered by the international scientific community, to
      have deduced the equation of infinite components that form the
      theoretical basis of Open Quantum Systems ".<br>
      <br>
      "On 12 April 2012, the journal Science published a study that
      confirms the existence of fermions which he theorized in 1938,
      which have the characteristic of not having the antimatter
      counterpart."<br>
      <br>
      "But for physicists from around the world, the name of Majorana is
      also linked to a 'another mystery, that of the hypothetical
      particle that bears his name and which would enjoy the
      extraordinary property of being matter and antimatter at the same
      time. Nothing more than a guess, at that time; Today, things seem
      to be bound to change. In theory, matter and antimatter are
      entirely irreconcilable. When they come into contact, they
      annihilate each other, releasing energy ... "<br>
      <br>
      "Ettore Majorana could have given a huge contribution to its
      nuclear physics with these particles of" Majorana ". His
      contribution to particle physics remains crucial, and now acquires
      new validity in the light of supersymmetry theory, which supports
      the thesis that all of Majorana particles have an antiparticle of
      the family of fermions at zero charge. This implies the existence
      of some supersymmetric partners of fermions, such as photino, the
      partner of the photon, and higgsino, the enigmatic anchor
      companion Higgs boson. "<br>
      <br>
      "He went to Leipzig and Copenhagen, and was awarded by the
      National Research Council for a grant for this journey that began
      at the end of January 1933 and lasted about six months. The
      meeting with Heisenberg was profitable, so much so that he was
      able (there where Fermi and others had failed) to be published by
      Majorana Über die Kerntheorie, in Zeitschrift für Physik. We have
      some of his letters the German period. "<br>
      <br>
      "On 20 January, in a letter to his mother he writes: 'At the
      Institute of Physics have welcomed me very warmly. I had a long
      conversation with Heisenberg that is extraordinarily polite and
      nice person '. "<br>
      <br>
      "In a letter to his father, February 18, writes: 'I wrote an
      article on the structure of the nuclei to Heisenberg liked
      although it contained some corrections to a theory'."<br>
      <br>
      "In a letter sent to Giovanni Gentile jr. He talks about stupid
      race theory; and his last published article Majorana expressed,
      albeit in an indirect way, a positive view of free will, that
      opinion seems incompatible with Nazism. "<br>
      <br>
      "Subsequently Majorana went to Copenhagen, where he met Niels
      Bohr. The friendship with Bohr took him to meet other important
      physicists of the time, including C. Moller and Arthur H.
      Rosenfeld, and attend George Placzek, who already knew for some
      time. "<br>
      <br>
      The historical, political, and cultural context in which they
      occurred the facts that we are analyzing is that of fascism in
      Italy and Nazism in Germany ... It is clear that the sad events
      were already in place, and the winds of war were already intuitive
      and perceptible, especially for a person like Ettore Majorana, who
      was intelligence, culture (including humanities), and sensitivity
      uncommon.<br>
      <br>
      E = mc 2<br>
      <br>
      "It is the physical equation that establishes the material
      equivalence between energy (E) and the mass (m) of a physical
      system. It was discovered in 1905 by the physicist and philosopher
      Albert Einstein. In Einstein's report are summarized basic
      properties of mass (matter), highlighted by his interactions with
      the energy ... "<br>
      <br>
      Surely Ettore Majorana was very forward in the understanding of
      nuclear physical phenomena, as evidenced by his education: he
      graduated in Theoretical Physics at the age of 23, on July 6,
      1929, with a thesis on "Mechanics of Radioactive Nuclei",
      supervisor Enrico Fermi, 110/110 cum laude; and as demonstrated by
      its publications, such as "On the theory of nuclei", and also that
      the "symmetrical theory of 'electron and the positron", just to
      name two of the most important and still relevant; Moreover his
      scientific discoveries, like the one anticipated the neutron (had
      a little over 20 years!), and in particular that of "symmetric
      theory of 'electron and' anti-electron", much in vogue today for
      its application to neutrinos and anti neutrino ( "anti-matter").
      Ettore Majorana was so secure more than aware of the large
      intrinsic energy of matter itself, of the 'atom nucleus, and how
      this type of studies and discoveries, then all' vanguard, could be
      potentially dangerous in the wrong hands.<br>
      <br>
      Let us return for a moment to the theory of the Neutron made by
      Ettore Majorana, since I consider a key episode also to understand
      the personality of the young scientist. In this case not only
      highlights the scientist's stature, in his early twenties, but
      also his "psychology"; In fact, despite having been widely
      requested to publish this important even by the Fermi theory,
      refused to do so ... Leonardo Sciascia expresses himself about in
      his work The disappearance of Majorana: "And in doing so had given
      up a possible Nobel prize! Also, when the Heisenberg theory was
      accepted and celebrated not share the regret of the other Physical
      Institute Roman ... But in regard to the German physicist
      conceives a feeling of admiration (and this contributes to
      self-awareness) and gratitude (and what contributes his fear).
      Heisenberg is like an unknown friend, one that without knowing it,
      without knowing it, as he saved from danger, avoided him as a
      sacrifice. "<br>
      <br>
      Ettore Majorana then became in 1937 Professor of Theoretical
      Physics at the Royal University of Naples, following the proposal
      of the jury took place "for special merits" (committee chaired by
      the Enrico Fermi). He was appointed Professor of Theoretical
      Physics at the Faculty of Mathematical, Physical and Natural of
      the Royal University of Naples "because of the high reputation of
      singular skill which has come in the field of theoretical physics
      studies ..."<br>
      <br>
      "In addition, the same Enrico Fermi is has gone to Sicily to visit
      Ettore Majorana just a short time before his death, even after a
      previous experiment in which the boys of Via Panisperna, having
      bombarded uranium with neutrons, while their experiment, they did
      not understand well what phenomenon was triggered ... And on this
      occasion of the visit to Sicily, the same Enrico Fermi he left his
      notebook on 'own uranium to Ettore Majorana, to maybe get him
      "enlightenment" in about. Perhaps this circumstance gave to Ettore
      Majorana the opportunity to understand in advance that physical
      phenomena of potentially destructive nature of nuclear power would
      be possible in the future, if the same phenomena were understood
      and explained? "<br>
      <br>
      This definitely Ettore Majorana was not wrong! If, as is true,
      "Enrico Fermi he designed and led the construction of the first
      nuclear fission reactor, which produced the first nuclear reaction
      controlled chain, and was one of the technical directors of the
      Manhattan Project, which led to the creation of the atomic bomb in
      the laboratories Los Alamos ... a few years later, the morning of
      August 6, 1945 at 8:16, the US Air Force launched on the Japanese
      city of Hiroshima, followed three days later by the launch of the
      bomb, "Fat Man" on Nagasaki. The number of direct victims is
      estimated from 100,000 to 200,000, almost exclusively civilians. "<br>
      <br>
      Then the hypothesis of a self isolation of Ettore Majorana
      volunteer, who has had as its main aim is not to reveal to the
      world his important insights and findings on the matter, and its
      enormous intrinsic energy, (potentially destructive), which could
      have have negative and destructive effects, which he certainly did
      not want, on people's lives and 'all mankind, if this energy had
      been devoted to evil, would be consistent with its voluntary
      alleged "disappearance ..."<br>
      <br>
      This hypothesis quite likely would agree with that formulated by
      Leonardo Sciascia, in his book The disappearance of Majorana,
      already mentioned above.<br>
      <br>
      "Ettore Majorana would be locked up in the Carthusian monastery of
      Serra San Bruno, to get away from everything and everyone, since
      they could not stand the social life. The monastic hypothesis is
      linked to the youth of Hector, who had attended the Institute
      Massimiliano Massimo of the Jesuits in Rome. A possible link with
      the past that shows up, a part of his youth. the researches of the
      same family, who wrote to Pope Pius XII Pacelli, promising not
      want to interfere at all the choices that may have accrued from
      Hector, just to know the Vatican simply if he were alive on this
      track were also addressed, but no answer, of any sign, was never
      provided. "<br>
      <br>
      The investigation into the "disappearance" of Ettore Majorana were
      timely and important from the very beginning, such was the fame
      that the character had already earned ... The same Duce, at the
      request of Enrico Fermi, personally urged the police organs and
      Italian secret services themselves if they occupied directly
      behind your order. According to some testimonies Majorana would
      have been spotted and recognized in Naples days after his apparent
      "disappearance." C 'is the acts of the police the very important
      testimony of a woman, that he should know him well, as had been
      his nurse, and therefore could hardly be mistaken for the reported
      circumstances. Just this witness in particular, would exclude the
      'hypothesis (in my opinion of itself lacks credibility) of suicide
      ... Then c' is also a second important witness, (even for this
      story) I continue always to police records, released by Jesuit
      Father De Francesco, who reports that "a young, very resembling
      Ettore Majorana, in the last days of March or in early April, it
      was presented to the top of the said Church of Gesu Nuovo, Naples,
      (located in Hotel is close to Bologna, where he then resided
      Ettore Majorana, which the Institute of Physics, asking to be
      hosted for a spiritual retreat, but then because of bureaucratic
      difficulties do not reappeared ... "in recent years, also c 'is
      also who claims to have met Ettore Majorana in Argentina ... it
      seems that investigations in this regard on the "disappearance" of
      Ettore Majorana have been recently re-opened in Italy, officially
      by the judiciary, and hopefully make full light on the whole
      affair.<br>
      <br>
      Now I will give the sensational events, if confirmed, that they
      gave rise to the title of this rather challenging my article:
      "Antimatter, the Free Energy of Ettore Majorana".<br>
      <br>
      There is a person who is still alive, his name is Rolando Pelizza,
      (source press release: "The truth of Ettore Majorana. Comes a New
      Science," by Pietro Panetta, President of 'International
      Association Life Project, web site: progevita.com), who claims to
      have met Ettore Majorana, "the Professor", after 20 years of its
      alleged "disappearance", from the year 1958. And even to have it
      later attended systematically, but does not say exactly where .<br>
      <br>
      (Note of 'Author: perhaps the Charterhouse of Serra San Bruno,
      near Lamezia Terme, in Calabria, as suggested by Leonardo Sciascia
      in his The disappearance of Majorana?). Already this first
      statement is so important and sensational, I wonder why it has not
      yet been examined and verified by the Judiciary, which has
      recently reopened the investigation into the alleged
      "disappearance" (in Argentina?) Ettore Majorana , in order to make
      full light, finally, on the events occurred.<br>
      <br>
      But there is much more: "Rolando Pelizza argues that Ettore
      Majorana, having taken a liking, as he too was gifted in
      mathematics and scientific intelligence capabilities, he would
      have sent all the theoretical principles of a new physics, and
      that he himself Rolando Pelizza would be put in a position, from
      this scientific knowledge of theoretical physics, obtained
      directly from Hector Majrana, to create a "science fiction"
      machine (now "Ray of Life" call), based on antimatter, whose beam
      generated by it, allows to precisely treat and modulate the
      antimatter, and would be able to annihilate the material through
      the generation of a huge heat inside the target material itself
      ... "<br>
      <br>
      But here it would open an important and serious chapter of the
      story: namely the fact that such a device, which can trigger an
      'enormous energy, and steerable beam, and can annihilate or
      disintegrate the material itself, would lend itself well to be
      used as a deadly weapon destructive ... and in the continuation we
      will see that this will have negative implications on the
      development of the story ...<br>
      <br>
      But we proceed with order. I will say right away that the
      allegation made by Rolando Pelizza (reported by Peter Panetta),
      would be entirely consistent with many of the details that hand in
      hand we revealed and reveal even later. It is not for me to judge,
      in the sense of giving objective opinions, official and definitive
      on the whole story, (although I've made a personal opinion which
      makes me believe that it is likely ...). I add only that it would
      be worthwhile to check the facts exposed by Pietro Panetta, in a
      systematic and official, also in the interest of Ettore Majorana
      family that still has the right to know the truth (if you still do
      not know). About what happened to Ettore Majorana in the year
      1938, but especially in the 'interest of the scientific community,
      which has always considered Ettore Majorana a physicist and one of
      the highest level scientist, perhaps the most important of the'
      900, it would be definitely worthy of a Nobel prize…<br>
      <br>
      Of course if this new physics introduced and enunciated by Ettore
      Majorana, they talk about Rolando Pelizza, Pietro Panetta (and not
      only them ...) was linked in particular to the antimatter
      discovery, if confirmed, and if the aforementioned equipment
      really existed, humanity would make enormous progress, because we
      would have a new source of energy, economic, unlimited and clean!
      Obviously if used for civilian purposes ... So it would be
      especially World interest to shed light on the whole story!<br>
      <br>
      "Already in the early 70's car Life radius, able to treat and as
      we said modular antimatter, it had already been built by Rolando
      Pelizza, and was running!"<br>
      <br>
      I realize that the reader this may seem like a fantastic story,
      but I would say that things are in all other way, are real! Many
      were in fact in the past, the direct witnesses of the events
      described, and could have him confirm whether they required. Even
      in this there are still some people who were direct witnesses of
      the facts and circumstances, and that they have elements in order
      to confirm the above ...<br>
      <br>
      But why, then, of this amazing invention "Ray of Life" made in the
      early '70s, little if it is spoken? And above all, why the
      positive effects of this new energy technology we have yet? And
      for this reason we continue to use fossil fuels which pollute the
      atmosphere (CO2), making us sick, and jeopardizing the survival of
      this planet Earth, because of the resulting global warming?<br>
      <br>
      Let us understand better.<br>
      <br>
      The following text, which I reproduce in full, was taken from the
      press release "The Truth about Ettore Majorana. Born a New
      Science, "by Pietro Panetta, President of the 'International
      Association of Project Life, downloadable from the website
      progevita.com<br>
      <br>
      Rolando Pelizza said that "after 20 years after his death, which
      took place by his will, Ettore Majorana knows him, and we are in
      1958. (Author's note: perhaps the Charterhouse of Serra San Bruno,
      near Lamezia Terme, in Calabria, as suggested by Leonardo Sciascia
      in his the disappearance of Majorana?) Ettore Majorana identifies
      him as a young gifted and led naturally to mathematics, what you
      probably wanted, and offered to work with him. Thus began for
      Rolando Pelizza extensive training of studies on Physics and
      Mathematics, Master gradually moved him all the knowledge to
      complete his theoretical project, which was already working for
      many years. Rolando Pelizza has the merit not only to have learned
      the theoretical knowledge, physics and mathematics, but also to
      have translated theory into practical application. In fact in the
      early '70s he was in possession of a device that would unleash the
      military world to hog that no metaphors that would be the most
      powerful weapon in the world, at very low costs. Rolando and his
      Master (Ettore Majorana) did not seek personal enrichment, and
      never, ever build a weapon; but they were busy with the conviction
      to give to the world of life and well-being tranquility. Here is
      the commitment not to allow anyone to employ this new knowledge
      for the purpose of mass destruction. "<br>
      <br>
      "At this point, however, comes into play another character who
      will have in this whole affair a leading role: Massimo Pugliese.
      He was initially presented as a consultant for the funding and
      development of new applications found initiatives; actually
      Rolando Pelizza knew after it was Ten. Col. of Carabinieri
      aggregate in SISDE on leave. By Massimo Pugliese it is involved
      then the 'American Embassy in Rome with the attendant Officer John
      Louis Manniello, who requested an experiment that demonstrates the
      effects on various materials and possibly recorded on magnetic
      tape. This happened later with the personal envoy of President
      Ford, Ing. Matteo Tutino, who expressed congratulations for the
      monumental discovery and the big American interest. The proposed
      agreement was to create a company with the American Government and
      Pelizza (then called the European Group) at 50%, evaluated a
      billion dollars.<br>
      <br>
      If it was not possible to change the law that prohibits the US
      government to participate in private companies, an entity under
      the control of the American government it would intervene. Pelizza
      agreed and reiterated the condition that it was necessary to
      complete the research that made the machine useful for peaceful
      applications, excluding all that was of military nature. The time
      required to conclude, as further proof, to knock down five
      satellites in orbit, and handed over a list of coordinates with
      the addition of being able to use the machine for both peaceful
      and military purposes. To this request Pelizza firmly opposes and
      truncates any negotiation.<br>
      <br>
      Pugliese at this point is unleashed, sending reports and movies
      right and left, informing Italian politicians, officials of both
      Italian and foreign services, processing and putting into
      circulation of contracts drafts, never authorized, holding
      conferences and impromptu discussions of scientific theories, etc.
      . "<br>
      <br>
      "But not only Pugliese gave a lot to do: even the friends of
      Brescia, whose number had now widened, never missed a chance to
      propose meetings and contacts. So you get to Loris Fortuna, then
      President of Industry Commission, which initially shows great
      interest with bombastic promises, ended in nothing. While plotting
      with Pugliese and was also entertained with Tutino, he gets to
      give Prof. Ezio Clementel then President of CNEN appointed to the
      request for an experimental test of the steel plates provided by
      the same Clementel. Performed the tests for the treated sheets are
      returned and accompanied by its movie, by Pugliese.<br>
      <br>
      The Great Teacher concluded: "If the execution of the tests had
      correctly place ...." Wrote cautiously in its report, and that
      expression "correctly" was referring to the video recording where
      you could see that the equipment of 'experiment was powered by a
      small battery, "... the powers involved are huge ... and requested
      the experiment results are not obtainable by currently known
      technologies"; this in a powerful report delivered to the then
      President of the Council of Ministers. Time lost, but not enough.
      Request for a new experiment. The it is noted that since the
      winter the area is inaccessible due to snow. The answer was an
      ultimatum: if within the next 15 days, did not give himself over
      to what is required, every Italian treaty was to be considered
      closed.<br>
      <br>
      "Thus began a relationship with the Belgian government: first, the
      request for an experimental test in the presence of one of their
      expert on lasers. Test performed, with the report produced by the
      expert, which among other eras a NATO Army Colonel. Belgium is
      proposed a deal in which the Belgian state and our society, which
      was to be a Holding Luxembourg which confer ownership rights,
      formed a joint venture to 50% each. The Belgian State undertook to
      finance what is necessary for the continuation of the research and
      would have paid five billion Belgian francs of the time a fee of
      50%, subject to the outcome of an experiment to be performed in
      Belgium.<br>
      <br>
      Pugliese in this negotiation is, from us, put aside. And needless
      to say the Italian Government, as an observer, gives mandate to
      the then Minister Plenipotentiary Antonio Mancini, great person
      for their professionalism, honesty and humanity that we remember
      with affection and esteem. The Belgian Parliament, to authorize
      the contract it should change their laws five. The drafting of the
      contract, in French, and under the control of the Belgian State
      Attorney; for our part we entrust the task to a lawyer of Brescia
      who knows the language, by recommending the highest priority
      non-negotiable points. Here comes the day of the signature in the
      presence of the five Ministers. The Prime Minister and Pelizza
      sign the contract, following the deposit, in a safe, the technical
      documentation at the State Bank. The key was holding the Director,
      the code figure in the Prime Minister and Pelizza. The release
      would take place after payment. At home re-reading the agreement
      carefully, you realize that the points of absolute priority that
      must not be altered are expressed thus: "the Ministers agree to
      abide by gentlemen ...", but the ministers are not eternal and who
      will respect the ' commitment?"<br>
      <br>
      "Start a dispute with meetings: the first in the private residence
      of the Prime Minister with the lawyer of the Belgian State,
      Pelizza, Mancini and Panetta, where it asks you to change the
      points that had been accepted and verbally, while denied the
      opportunity to correct the contract, the prime minister thumbed
      through the dossier which could be glimpsed some of the
      documentation sheet deposited in the bank. If this was true it
      meant that the safe had been broken, there was no certainty, but
      doubt s'alimentava and also explained certain attitudes. The
      refusal received induces Panetta, who represented the absolute
      majority of the company, to request an audience lawyer of the
      Belgian State. Following several meetings and agreed at the end
      the following: the lawyer of Belgian State agreed with the Prime
      Minister by telephone in the presence of Panetta, of moving
      forward the logged experiments in the contract, but that in case
      of failure the contract would be automatically revoked, making
      free the parties from any obligation. This forced him to do the
      experiment to not be in default; so you decide to give during the
      experiment with the intention not to make it succeed.<br>
      <br>
      Fixed the day of the experiment, the Min. Mancini with the
      Belgians organized the transfer of the machine Chiari (BS) on
      board a van escorted by plainclothes political police, with the
      destination airport of Ghedi military, where it was loaded onto a
      military plane Belgian, aboard which climbed Pelizza, Panetta,
      Mancini and Professional Rome. In addition to the pilots there was
      the Belgian colonel who previously attended an experimental trial
      in Italy, and the report of which the Belgian Government
      authorized the contract, which earned him a promotion to General.
      Destination military zone of Braschaat, Belgium. Arrived, he
      locked the car, and the keys were handed over to Pelizza. The
      following day, to attend the trials of the protocol beyond us
      there were the Belgian General, three Professors of a European
      Centre, two Italian researchers including Ezio Clementel, the
      company Professionals, lawyers and other people who were not
      submitted. In the narrow bunkers, where was placed the machine,
      Pelizza start some evidence out of the Protocol of the materials
      found in the local and perfectly managed. Panetta attended with
      him and Mancini, and this gave rise to the evidence. The first,
      not covered, was to destroy a tank...<br>
