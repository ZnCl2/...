      <br>
      Coating engine components with hard carbon reduces friction to
      almost zero – a development that could save billions of liters of
      fuel worldwide every year. Now researchers have developed a new
      laser method to apply the coating on the production line<br>
      <br>
      Scientists already know how to coat components with diamond-like
      carbon to minimize friction. But now Fraunhofer researchers have
      developed a laser arc method with which layers of carbon almost as
      hard as diamond can be applied on an industrial scale at high
      coating rates and with high thicknesses. By applying carbon
      coatings to engine components such as piston rings and pins, fuel
      consumption can be reduced. "Systematic application of our new
      method could save more than 100 billion liters of fuel each year
      over the next ten years," says Prof. Andreas Leson from the
      Fraunhofer Institute for Material and Beam Technology IWS in
      Dresden, referencing a study that was published in the journal
      Tribology International in 2012.<br>
      <br>
      Carbon-based coatings are already used in volume production. But
      now the team of IWS researchers led by Prof. Leson, Dr.
      Hans-Joachim Scheibe and Dr. Volker Weihnacht has succeeded in
      producing hydrogen-free ta-C coatings on an industrial scale at a
      consistent level of quality. These tetrahedral amorphous carbon
      coatings are significantly harder and thus more resistant to wear
      than conventional diamond-like coatings. "Unfortunately, you can't
      just scrape off diamond dust and press it onto the component. So
      we had to look for a different method," says Dr. Scheibe, who has
      spent over 30 years investigating carbon's friction-reducing
      properties.<br>
      <br>
      A pulsed laser controls the light arc<br>
      <br>
      In a similar style to old-fashioned film projectors, the laser arc
      method generates an arc between an anode and a cathode (the
      carbon) in a vacuum. The arc is initiated by a laser pulse on the
      carbon target. This produces a plasma consisting of carbon ions,
      which is deposited as a coating on the workpiece in the vacuum. To
      run this process on an industrial scale, a pulsed laser is
      vertically scanned across a rotating graphite cylinder as a means
      of controlling the arc. The cylinder is converted evenly into
      plasma thanks to the scanning motion and rotation. To ensure a
      consistently smooth coating, a magnetic field guides the plasma
      and filters out any particles of dirt.<br>
      <br>
      The laser arc method can be used to deposit very thick ta-C
      coatings of up to 20 micrometers at high coating rates. "High
      coating thicknesses are crucial for certain applications –
      especially in the auto industry, where components are exposed to
      enormous loads over long periods of time," says Dr. Weihnacht.<br>
      <br>
      The automotive and motorcycle manufacturer BMW is working
      intensively on the industrial-scale implementation of ta-C engine
      components in its various vehicle models with the aim of reducing
      their fuel consumption. Prof. Leson sees this as the first major
      step in using the laser arc method to save resources. And as a
      motorcycle aficionado himself, he also sees another positive
      effect stemming from this development: "The fact that our research
      is helping to make motorcycling more environmentally friendly
      eases my conscience every time I go for a ride," he says, unable
      to suppress a smile.<br>
      <br>
      Andreas Leson, Hans-Joachim Scheibe and Volker Weihnacht received
      the 2015 Joseph von Fraunhofer Prize for the development of the
      laser arc method and the application of ta-C coatings in volume
      production.<br>

        <b>METHOD OF PRODUCING AN ANTI-WEAR LAYER AND ANTI-WEAR LAYER
          PRODUCED BY MEANS OF SAID METHOD</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      The invention concerns the production of anti-wear layers disposed
      on surfaces of internal combustion engine components which are
      exposed to frictional wear. According to the method, anti-wear
      layers are formed on the particular surface by means of electrical
      arc discharge under vacuum conditions. The anti-wear layers are
      formed from at least approximately hydrogen-free, tetrahedral
      amorphous (ta-C) carbon consisting of a mixture of sp2 and sp3
      hybridized carbon, and have a microhardness of at least 3500 HV
      and an arithmetic mean surface measure Ra of 0.1 [mu]m, without
      mechanical, physical and/or chemical surface treatment.<br>

      A process for producing a wear protection layer and prepared by
      the process wear protection layer<br>
      <br>
      The invention relates to a method for the production of
      wear-resistant coatings which have been formed on surfaces of
      components of internal combustion engines which are subjected to
      frictional wear by means of electric arc discharge under vacuum
      conditions on the respective surface, and produced with the method
      of wear-resistant coatings.<br>
      <br>
      The wear-resistant coatings are made wasserstrofffreien,
      tetrahedral amorphous from sp &lt;2&gt; and sp &lt;3&gt;
      hybridized carbon (ta-C) formed.<br>
      <br>
      It has been shown that these types of layers in which a maximum
      hydrogen content of 1 atomic%, preferably not more than 0.5
      atomic% still want to allow, have particularly favorable wear and
      lubricating properties.<br>
      <br>
      It was therefore suggested that these layers are on a variety of
      surfaces of components subject to wear of internal combustion
      engines, as for example piston rings, tappets, cams of camshafts
      or piston pin to use.<br>
      <br>
      This layers have a high hardness and therefore increased wear
      resistance.<br>
      <br>
      The attainable friction at a sliding action on the surface of a
      not so coated base or GE genkörpers are low, so that this will
      affect the economic operation and the C02 footprint advantageous
      effect.<br>
      <br>
      Such layers can with different PVD vacuum coating process using a
      graphite cathode are made.<br>
      <br>
      It has been found that an especially high deposition rate can be
      achieved in the process, can be reached in which electric arcs
      between an anode and a cathode formed from graphite.<br>
      <br>
      In these methods, but it is disadvantageous that in the coating
      larger particles or even so-called droplets are formed which are
      deposited in the layer and the surface properties are thereby
      adversely affected, so that the surface must be leveled by a post.<br>
      This prepares in layers, which have a particularly high hardness,
      but significant problems that cure especially in micro- above 5000
      HV detrimental because an extremely high time expenditure is
      required to obtain sufficiently smooth surfaces of these layers
      for a favorable sliding behavior to.<br>
      <br>
      Is particularly suitable for the formation of such hard layers
      called the Laser-Arc process in which an electric arc in a vacuum
      by means of a pulsed laser beam ignited and with the on<br>
      <br>
      Arc obtained plasma of ionized particle flow in this, the ionized
      particles can be deposited out to a substrate and a coating,
      suitable ..<br>
      <br>
      This type of layers may, however also in a per se known method, in
      which an electrical arc discharge is in the vacuum for generating
      the plasma used without the Are arc discharge is initiated by a
      laser beam applied.<br>
      <br>
      Here, the arc in known manner either be ignited only by a
      sufficiently high voltage between an anode and a cathode connected
      as a target and, secondly, there is the possibility that ignition
      means of electrically conductive ignition elements due<br>
      Initiate short-circuit.<br>
      <br>
      These known methods, however, have the disadvantage that their
      plasma is relatively rich in droplets and particles.<br>
      <br>
      However, possibilities have been proposed to counter this
      drawback, to perform a so-called "filtering" of the plasma for
      storage of particles.<br>
      <br>
      Several options for this are available from BF Coli and DM Sanders
      in "Design of Vacuum arenes based Sources"; Surface and Coatings
      Technology ", No. 81 (1996) 42-51 described.<br>
      This is based on these known solutions, the fact that using
      magnetic fields, the ionized light components of a plasma can be
      deflected and, because of their unfavorable Droppings charge /
      mass ratio, serious deflectable particles can be separated from
      each other substantially larger.<br>
      <br>
      However, these filter assemblies have some significant
      disadvantages:<br>
      <br>
      The design of these systems is very complex and expensive.<br>
      <br>
      The diameter of the magnetic filter and thus the diameter of the
      coating surface is limited due to the strong magnetic fields
      needed and of the necessary electrical power to about 150 mm.<br>
      <br>
      The coating rate of the process is reduced to approximately 15-20%
      compared to that without use of the magnetic filter.<br>
      <br>
      For processes in which electric arcs are used for coating, is in
      EN 2006 10 009 160 AI to use an absorber electrode and proposed by
      magnets to separate larger particles from a plasma and thus
      prevent these settle in the coating and characterized the surface
      geometry is adversely affected.<br>
      <br>
      However, no layers are known, which are formed from hydrogen-free
      tetrahedral amorphous from sp &lt;2&gt; and sp &lt;3&gt;
      hybridized carbon (ta-C), which have increased hardness, while
      very good sliding friction at the same time, taking on component
      surfaces with a increased deposition rate by means of electric arc
      discharges have been deposited without subsequent surface
      treatment, which leads to leveling of surveys and reduce the
      roughness, must be carried out.<br>
      <br>
      It is therefore an object of the invention to provide a
      wear-resistant coating for stressed on sliding surfaces of
      components of internal combustion engines are available, having an
      improved wear resistance and simultaneously improved sliding
      properties, the production can be effected with reduced effort and
      increased deposition rate by means of electric arc discharges.<br>
      <br>
      According to the invention this object is achieved with the
      features of claim 1.<br>
      The claim 7 relates to the method produced wear-resistant
      coatings.<br>
      <br>
      Advantageous refinements and developments of the invention can be
      used with features that are in the subordinate claims referred
      realized.<br>
      <br>
      With the inventive method wear protective layers on surfaces of
      internal combustion engines, which are exposed to frictional wear,
      produced.<br>
      <br>
      Here, a plasma by pulsed laser irradiation sequentially ignited
      electric arc discharges in vacuum conditions, in which the
      electric arc discharge between an anode and a cathode are operated
      as graphite formed.<br>
      <br>
      There are ionized parts of the plasma as a layer consisting of at
      least approximately hydrogen-free, tetrahedral amorphous (ta-C),
      consisting of a mixture of sp &lt;2&gt; and sp &lt;3&gt;
      hybrisiertem carbon (ta-C according to VDI<br>
      <br>
      Be in 2840) formed and deposited on a surface of at least one
      component.<br>
      <br>
      Positively charged ions of the plasma are moved by means of an
      absorber electrode toward the at least one component.<br>
      <br>
      In this case, the same voltage is applied to at least
      approximately the anode and the absorber electrode.<br>
      <br>
      While the electrical arc discharges can be operated to flow
      through the absorber electrode, an electric current of at least
      1.5-fold greater, preferably at least two times greater than the
      electrical generic current flowing through the anode, is.<br>
      There is no mechanical and / or chemical post-processing of the
      coated surface of the at least one component, which results in a
      smoothing of the surface is carried out.<br>
      A subsequent smoothing of the surface of the formed wear
      protection layer is not particularly influencing the current
      flowing through the anode electrode and the absorber respectively
      different electric current through the loading required.<br>
      Advantageously, the plasma is formed within a laser arc chamber
      and a vacuum chamber in which the at least one component is
      arranged, directed versa.<br>
      <br>
      The laser arc chamber can be flanged to the vacuum chamber.<br>
      <br>
      In the laser arc chamber, a vacuum is also respected.<br>
      <br>
      By means of the absorber electrode should be as deflected
      positively charged ions of the plasma, that it, starting from the
      cathode do not directly<br>
      Way impinge on the surface of the at least one component and
      electrons move from the plasma toward the absorber electrode, so
      that they move not possible or with a small number in the
      direction to be coated component surface.<br>
      <br>
      With at least one arranged arc discharge or sputter source, which
      is arranged in the vacuum chamber, a thin adhesive layer on the at
      least one component may be deposited.<br>
      Advantageously, an absorber electrode used with a plurality of
      strips.<br>
      <br>
      Larger droplets or droplets can be discharged between the Streif
      s, so that it does not impinge on the surface of the at least one
      component.<br>
      <br>
      A movement direction of droplets inducing reflection can be
      largely avoided.<br>
      The wear-resistant coating according to the invention is produced
      on surfaces of internal combustion engines that are subjected to
      frictional wear, trained.<br>
      They have been trained by means of electric arc under vacuum
      conditions on the respective surface, and are made of at least
      approximately hydrogen-free, tetrahedral amorphous (TAC)
      consisting constituted &lt;3&gt; hybrisiertem carbon from a
      mixture of sp &lt;2&gt; and SP.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably, they can be formed with the aforementioned
      laser-arenes process.<br>
      <br>
      The wear-resistant coating has a microhardness of 3500 HV and an
      arithmetic mean roughness Ravon 0.1 µ?? on.<br>
      <br>
      Here no subsequent mechanical, physical and / or chemical surface
      treatment is necessary in order to comply with this roughness can.<br>
      <br>
      The wear-resistant coating according to the invention can
      advantageously have produced µ?? also an average roughness Rzvon
      maximum 1.0.<br>
      <br>
      The total averaged roughness Rzentspricht the arithmetic mean of
      all readings Einzelrau- deep.<br>
      <br>
      The wear-resistant coating according to the invention produced
      should a reduced peak height Rpkvon µ?? maximum of 0.35,
      preferably a maximum of 0.25 µ??.<br>
      <br>
      This value is in particular from the standpoint of reduced
      friction, and therefore are beneficial.<br>
      <br>
      Both the arithmetic average roughness Ra, as well as the other two
      roughness R2undPkkönnen be determined with the known profile
      method.<br>
      <br>
      Here, a probe tip that is preferably made of diamond, and a small
      tip radius should have, be used.<br>
      <br>
      It if the wear protective layer has a microhardness of 3500 HV,
      preferably 4000 HV, more preferably at least 5000 HV, preferably
      of at least 5700 HV and most preferably from 6000 HV and
      preferably a roughness Rakleiner 0.08 µ?? is particularly
      favorable, more preferably less than 0.05 m_aufweist, whereby the
      wear resistance and the durability can be further improved or
      increased.<br>
      <br>
      For the hardness measurement may be achieved in a device
      "FISCHERSCOPE H100C XYP" from Helmut Fischer GmbH &amp; Co. KG be
      used.<br>
      <br>
      The test load should be chosen so that the penetration depth of
      the indenter is a maximum of 1/10 of the film thickness.<br>
      <br>
      With an inventively produced wear-resistant coating on the piston
      pin, in a tribological system consisting of counter-body
      connecting rod with sleeve (brass) and aluminum pistons with a
      vibration friction wear tribometer with piston pin module from
      Optimol Instruments Prüftechnik GmbH a coefficient of friction
      less than 0.03, preferably less than 0.025 can be achieved.<br>
      <br>
      This is the case with oil-lubricated tests in a temperature range
      between 100 ° C and 130 ° C, as is typical for components of
      internal combustion engines, too.<br>
      <br>
      The friction coefficient changes only slightly over the lifetime
      of the coated component, whereby a reduction in the coefficient of
      friction could be detected after a short running time.<br>
      <br>
      The wear rate can be reduced by a factor of 3 compared to
      conventional DLC coatings.<br>
      The proportion of SP should be &lt;3&gt; hybridized carbon
      preferably well above 40%, above 50%.<br>
      In addition, should the anti-wear layer no other chemical
      elements, such as metals or halogens or Phosphorus be included.<br>
      <br>
      This also applies to chemical compounds.<br>
      <br>
      This only an inert gas such as argon and no particular hydrocarbon
      compound should be included in the laser chamber and Are in the
      vacuum chamber, if necessary.<br>
      <br>
      The layer thicknesses should be at least 0.5 µ??, preferably at
      least 2 µ?? or more.<br>
      <br>
      Advantageous may have been formed on the surface to be coated at
      least one adhesive and / or intermediate layer, on which then a
      wear-resistant layer of the invention is formed.<br>
      For this purpose, for example, be chosen µ?? a chromium layer
      having a thickness of at least 0.1.<br>
      <br>
      In the preparation may advantageously a cylindrical cathode
      (target) can be used made of graphite, which rotates during the
      process about its longitudinal axis, so that the respective base
      points of the electrical arc discharges extend over the entire
      surface of the cathode, thereby achieving a geleich- excessive
      removal of carbon can be.<br>
      <br>
      Ignition of GE pulses powered electrical arc discharges with a
      laser beam, the laser beam can be also operated in a pulsed
      accordingly and deflected so that it impinges at various
      predetermined positions on the surface of the cathode and there as
      a result of the energy input an electrical see arc discharge at
      each laser pulse, can be ignited.<br>
      <br>
      The electrical voltage between an anode and the cathode is
      controlled so that the arc will go out again in each case after a
      predetermined time to subsequently burn at a different position, a
      new arc discharge.<br>
      <br>
      The layer thickness of a wear-resistant coating can be formed by
      means of the number of unused electric arc discharges, are
      affected with a known size of a surface to be coated.<br>
      <br>
      Other process parameters should, however, be kept as constant as
      possible.<br>
      <br>
      With the parameters of electrical current and voltage with the
      electric arc discharges are operated whose duration, the pulse
      rate and one on a component to be coated (substrate) during the
      arc pulse applied bias voltage can also affect the trainees layer
      are taken.<br>
      <br>
      This concerns in particular the layer structure and in particular
      the proportions of sp &lt;2&gt; and sp &lt;3&gt; hybridized<br>
      Carbon.<br>
      <br>
      So electric currents above 1000 A, are preferably used above 1500
      A and a pulse frequency of between 300 Hz and 600 Hz can be
      selected.<br>
      <br>
      There may be a bias voltage at - 50 V to - 200 V, preferably 100 V
      is applied to the component to be coated in the field.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, an electric current of 500 A ± 100 A can flow through the
      absorber electrode (preferably ± 50 A) through the anode and of
      1100 ± 100 A A (preferably ± 50 A), when electrical arc discharges
      are ignited and operated.<br>
      <br>
      Operation of electric arc discharges can be performed with a pulse
      duration in the range 250 to 600 µ $ µ5.<br>
      <br>
      A termination of the electrical arc discharges can be achieved by
      reducing the electrical voltage at least at the anode.<br>
      <br>
      An ignition of electric arc discharges according to a pulsed
      carried out irradiation of the surface of the cathode with a
      directed laser beam to the surface may take place at an increased
      electrical voltage, which is reduced after the ignition of the
      respective electric arc discharge.<br>
      <br>
      In the coating apparatus should be used, with the larger particles
      are prevented from impinging on the surface to be coated.<br>
      <br>
      This can each alone, be an absorber electrode.<br>
      <br>
      In this case, a structure may be used as it is 10 2006 009 160 AI
      known from DE, the disclosure of which reference in its entirety
      is incorporated herein.<br>
      <br>
      In this case, at least one permanent magnetic element is inserted,
      which is aligned parallel to the rotation axis of the cathode and
      parallel to the surface of a cathode.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, while an absorber electrode is available with which
      an electric field is formed, is passed through the electric arc
      formed by the discharge plasma.<br>
      <br>
      With both the / the Permaentmagnetelement (s), as well as with the
      absorber electrode larger particles contained in the plasma can
      thus be influenced in their movement, particularly in its
      direction of movement that they do not impinge on the surface to
      be coated or there at an angle, the one Installation avoids into
      the layer.<br>
      <br>
      Additionally, at least one aperture between the surface to be
      coated of a part and the cathode may be arranged through which the
      plasma, the carbon ions, which can be used for layer formation,
      containing is performed in the direction of the surface to be
      coated.<br>
      The absorber electrode can be arranged in the direction of
      movement of the plasma by a diaphragm and / or anode.<br>
      <br>
      A Permant magnet element may for example be arranged in the shade
      of a diaphragm or a diaphragm element.<br>
      <br>
      The invention will be described in closer detail.<br>
      <br>
      In which:<br>
      <br>
      Figure 1 shows in schematic form the structure of a device for the
      Education is inventive wear-resistant coatings suitable.<br>
      <br>
      Figure 1 showed a vacuum coating system with a vacuum chamber 1 in
      fixed rotational device to be coated components 14 and thus both
      with double and triple rotation can be coated.<br>
      <br>
      In the vacuum chamber 1 are known or arc discharge Sputter 2 or a
      combination of both for plasma etching or the deposition of a thin
      adhesive layer present.<br>
      <br>
      In the vacuum chamber 1, a laser arc chamber is flanged 3 with
      rotating graphite roll as KathodelO and a film pull 11 to protect
      the laser entrance window before steaming.<br>
      <br>
      In direction of the vacuum chamber 1, a filter module 4, with
      service door and internal structure of the absorber-anode
      arrangement 5, 6, and side-mounted permanent magnet arrangement 7
      is present.<br>

      electric arc discharge between the cathode 10 and the anode 6
      selected from the generated plasma larger particles towards the
      absorber electrode 5 is illustrated with an arrow.<br>
      <br>
      The electric arc discharges are ignited by means of the
      deflectable laser beam 9 on the surface of the cathode 10, which
      consists of 99.9% graphite.<br>
      <br>
      Here, the cathode 10 is rotated about a rotation axis that is
      aligned perpendicular to the plane of the drawing and the laser
      beam 9 is deflected along this axis of rotation.<br>
      Thereby, a uniform removal of cathode material and at the same
      time a large area to be coated in the vacuum chamber 1 can be
      used.<br>
      <br>
      The absorber electrode 5 is electrically connected to a positive
      potential.<br>
      <br>
      It is provided with a plurality of electrically conductive
      strip-shaped elements which are arranged at a distance from each
      other, are formed.<br>
      <br>
      Between the strip-like elements column formed by the larger
      particles can be performed.<br>
      The Bezugszeichenl3 illustrates the path of the deflected carbon
      ions of the plasma to the rotation device with the components to
      be coated 14 with an arrow.<br>

      After evacuation of the vacuum chamber 1 and performing the
      surface cleaning and activation a Cr adhesion layer having a
      thickness of about 0.1 micron is deposited by sputtering.<br>
      <br>
      Following the deposition of ta-C layer is to a thickness of about
      1 pm.<br>
      <br>
      Due to the selected parameters of pulsed laser arc source,
      electric arc current 1600 A, pulse duration 350 ps at a frequency
      of 520 Hz in combination with the adapted to the laser arc source
      substrate-bias parameters in a high voltage range of - 800 V with
      a pulse length of 350 ps and a low voltage of - 100 V at a pulse
      length of 200 ps, ??very hard and smooth ta-C coatings with high
      adhesion to the component surface (Rc 1) are deposited.<br>
      <br>
      There is a distribution of the electric current, wherein 1100 A
      flowing through the absorber electrode 5 and the anode 6 through
      500 A.<br>
      <br>
      The anode 6 is arranged closer to the cathode 10, as the facing in
      the direction of the cathode 10 the base of the absorber electrode
      5.<br>
      <br>
      The specific means of profilometer roughness, are as follows: Raim
      means 0.09 pm, Rzim means 1.0 pm and 0.28 pm Rpkim means.<br>
      <br>
      The determined by Fischerscope microhardness of the wear-resistant
      coating amounts to 7040 HV or the specific means LAWave modulus is
      740 GPa.<br>
