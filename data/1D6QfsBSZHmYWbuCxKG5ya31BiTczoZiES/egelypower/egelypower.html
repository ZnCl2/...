        <div align="left">The invention is a renewable energy production
          process with resonant nano-dust plasma, with the application
          of a cavity resonator and an acoustic resonator. During the
          process the acoustic resonator is placed inside the cavity
          resonator, and create a series of acoustic resonances with a
          complex plasma made of sub-micron sized carbon dust, hydrogen
          isotopes and other gases between 10 Pa and 500 kPa at about
          2.000Â° C., thus creating oscillations and thus plasmon
          polaritons on the surface of carbon dust particles oscillating
          between 10 kHz-5 GHz and in the terahertz range, which in turn
          produces heat or electric energy, or creates a series of
          nuclear transmutations. The invention is an embodiment
          producing renewable heat, formed by a cavity resonator (30)
          excited by electromagnetic fields, and an acoustic resonator
          (10). In the acoustic resonator (10) operated with a number of
          acoustic resonances, there are nano-sized dust particles (1).
          The electromagnetic cavity resonator (30) is cylindrical,
          spherical or rectangular with mirror-like internal walls (31),
          inside of which the cylindrical or spherical acoustic
          resonator (10) suitably made of heat resistant and
          electrically insulating material is mounted.<br>

      <b>Abstract</b><br>
      The subject of the invention is a process for heat production with
      nuclear interactions. During the process the gas is pumped through
      a stack of nanoparticles in a device featuring an internal and an
      external chamber via an inlet and an outlet opening, and the
      process is initiated by heating the device. Further, the subject
      of the invention is a device accomplishing said process. The
      device has an interconnected internal chamber, and surrounding
      said chamber there is an external chamber having at least one
      inlet and one exit opening. There are nanoparticles in the
      internal chamber. There is an impermeable wall between the two
      said chambers. The internal chamber is separated from the exit
      opening by a heat resistant, porous ceramic wall. There is a
      heating element on the internal side wall.<br>
