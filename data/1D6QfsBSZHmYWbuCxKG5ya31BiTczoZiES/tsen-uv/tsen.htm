      <p>The technique destroys a virus with a pulse of light from a
        low-power laser. The pulse produces mechanical vibrations in the
        virus shell, or capsid, irreversibly damaging and disintegrating
        it, and so "deactivating" the virus for good. The technique
        might be used to kill HIV, as well as hepatitis C, say the
        researchers involved. Traditional methods of destroying viruses,
        such as UV irradiation, can cause mutations, which eventually
        make the micro-organisms resistant. UV light can also damage the
        DNA of surrounding healthy cells. Scientists have also tried
        using microwaves to kill viruses but this is even less promising
        since the water in and around a micro-organism strongly absorbs
        this frequency of light. Most of the energy from the microwave
        radiation is absorbed by the water and does not even reach the
        virus itself. The researchers applied pulses of purple-coloured
        light lasting just 100 femtoseconds (10-15 seconds) to viruses
        called M13 bacteriophages. It takes just a single pulse to
        destroy the viruses completely, say the researchers. The "power
        density" of the laser is just 50 megawatts per square
        centimetre, which is low enough to leave surrounding human cells
        and tissue undamaged, but high enough to produce large-amplitude
        vibrations in a virus's capsid. It is also too low to cause
        genetic mutations, meaning the virus will not build up resistant
        to the treatment over time. Disinfecting blood - Tsen told New
        Scientist that the technique could be used to disinfect blood or
        other biological samples in hospitals. "In addition, we believe
        that the method may be especially important in designing novel
        treatments for blood-borne viral diseases," he said. "For
        example blood dialysis allows us to irradiate a patient's blood
        outside the body and potentially cleanse it of infectious virus
        particles before reintroducing it into the patient. In this way,
        we could reduce mortality associated with diseases like
        hepatitis C and AIDS." The team now plans to test the efficacy
        of its technique in killing a wide range of deadly viruses,
        including HIV and hepatitis C. "We also plan to conduct further
        tests on the effects of the low-power visible laser on mammalian
        cells to determine any potential side effects and confirm that
        it selectively kills viruses," said Tsen. </p>

      <p><b>Abstract --</b> We demonstrate for the first time that, by
        using a visible femtosecond laser, it is effective to inactivate
        viruses such as bacteriophage M13 through impulsive stimulated
        Raman scattering. By using a very low power visible femtosecond
        laser having a wavelength of 425 nm and a pulse width of 100 fs,
        we show that M13 phages were inactivated when the laser power
        density was greater than or equal to 50 MW cm-2. The
        inactivation of M13 phages was determined by plaque counts and
        depended on the pulse width as well as power density of the
        excitation laser. </p>

      <p><b>Abstract --- </b>Ultraviolet light produces a rapid
        detoxifying effect with subsidence of toxic symptoms. Venous
        oxygen is increased in patients with depressed blood oxygen
        values. Of special interest is that a rapid rise in resistance
        to acute or chronic viral and bacterial infection occurs. No
        harmful affects have been observed with UBI therapy in thousands
        of cases of viral infections, hepatitis, bacterial infections,
        hypoxemia and many other illnesses, especially blood-related
        infections. The diseases successfully treated with UBI include:
        (1) Atypical pneumonia; (2) Poliomyelitis and polioencephalitis;
        (3) Hepatitis; infectious and serum; (4) Influenza; (5) common
        upper respiratory disease; (6) Herpes simplex; (7) Herpes
        zoster; (8) Mumps; (9) Mononucleosis; and (10) measles.
        Moreover, preliminary reports indicate that UBI may be useful in
        treating HIV and research is currently under way to evaluate the
        effects of UBI on eliminating HIV from blood and blood products.
        If this research is successful, it would have major implications
        in ensuring the safety of blood in blood banks. </p>

        irradiation station from the UV light source. </p>
      <p><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>Ultraviolet (UV) blood irradiation (UBI) therapy may be
        administered by a device called a Knott HEMO-IRRADIATOR.RTM.,
        for example as disclosed in Knott's U.S. Pat. No. 2,308,516
        identified above under paragraph (4). UBI therapy raises the
        resistance of the host and is therefore able to control many
        disease processes. A fundamental effect of UBI is to energize or
        enhance the biochemical and physiological defenses of the body
        by the introduction of UV energy into the blood stream. It is
        well known that UV radiation is used to purify water and treat
        sewage. It has been amply demonstrated, as evidenced by the
        above cited patents, that UV radiation can purify and clean the
        blood of contaminations in the form of viruses and bacteria. </p>
      <p>Such treatment is intravenously applied by irradiating blood
        with a controlled amount of UV energy in the accepted
        therapeutic band. This produces a rapid detoxifying effect with
        subsidence of toxic symptoms. Venous oxygen is increased in
        patients with depressed blood oxygen values. Of special interest
        is that a rapid rise in resistance to acute or chronic viral and
        bacterial infection occurs. No harmful affects have been
        observed with UBI therapy in thousands of cases of viral
        infections, hepatitis, bacterial infections, hypoxemia and many
        other illnesses, especially blood-related infections. </p>
      <p>The diseases successfully treated with UBI include: (1)
        Atypical pneumonia; (2) Poliomyelitis and polioencephalitis; (3)
        Hepatitis; infectious and serum; (4) Influenza; (5) common upper
        respiratory disease; (6) Herpes simplex; (7) Herpes zoster; (8)
        Mumps; (9) Mononucleosis; and (10) measles. </p>
      <p>Moreover, preliminary reports indicate that UBI may be useful
        in treating HIV and research is currently under way to evaluate
        the effects of UBI on eliminating HIV from blood and blood
        products. If this research is successful, it would have major
        implications in ensuring the safety of blood in blood banks. </p>
      <p>The Knott technique of blood irradiation (approved by the
        American Blood Irradiation Society) has achieved the following
        physiologic objectives: (1) increases the blood oxygen level;
        (2) increases phagocytosis; (3) relieves toxemia; (4) decreases
        edema; and (5) controls nausea and vomiting. </p>
      <p>Treatment generally consists of withdrawing from 1.0 to 1.5 cc
        of blood per pound of body weight from the patient, citrating it
        and, by use of the Knott HEMO-IRRADIATOR.RTM. exposing it to
        radiant energy between the wave lengths of 2,000 and 12,000
        angstroms units as it passes through the irradiation unit at a
        predetermined flow rate. The blood is returned to the patient
        through the needle used for the initial venipuncture. Treatment
        requires from 30-45 minutes. Outpatients rest fifteen minutes,
        after which time they may resume whatever activity is permitted.
      </p>
      <p>The primary object of the present invention is to provide an
        improved blood irradiation method and apparatus based on the
        aforementioned Knott-HEMO-IRRADIATOR.RTM. device which has FDA
        approval. </p>
      <p>Other objects, advantages and features of the present invention
        are to: (1) provide a pump and UV light source interface that
        enables the UV light source to be changed without disassembling
        the pump; (2) provide solid state electronic circuitry thereby
        eliminating the use of vacuum tubes; (3) provide a counter to
        record the number of exposure sessions, thereby making available
        a usage history and assist in billing patients; (4) incorporate
        power circuitry to allow both international and domestic use;
        (5) use a UV radiation source which emits relatively little heat
        during usage, thus eliminating the need for a cooling system and
        also allowing the use of polymeric materials; (6) incorporate a
        self-diagnostic capability to monitor the pump, UV source and
        control system; (7) provide the ability to select the type of UV
        range, i.e. UVA, UVB or UVC; (6) incorporate a data output port
        for printer, floppy drive, hard drive, etc.; (9) significantly
        reduce the size and weight of the apparatus for easier
        portability of the apparatus; (10) use a clear polymeric
        irradiation chamber, preconnected to the disposable IV set; (11)
        provide use of a material for use as a cuvette for irradiating
        blood and which is equivalent to quartz crystal in the transfer
        of UV to the irradiated blood for inactivation of pathogens in
        the blood; (12) to provide disposable cuvettes; (13) provide
        total containment of the UV source and irradiation chamber to
        prevent leakage of UV energy into the environment and include a
        cover shield for shielding the eyes of the operator while
        enabling observation of the blood flow through the cuvette in
        the irradiation station; (14) a UV blood irradiation apparatus
        that fully complies with the safety regulations of OSHA and
        other government regulatory agencies and to incorporate sensors
        to monitor UV intensity motor speed, blood flow rate, etc.; (15)
        provide intermittent operation of the UV source coupled with
        providing turbulent blood flow within irradiation chamber; (16)
        to provide various wavelengths in the range from 2,000 to 12,000
        Angstroms for the irradiation treatment of blood; (17) enable
        improved quality control of the control circuitry for
        controlling the pump and the UV light source; and (18) provide
        apparatus of the type specified herein that is user friendly to

      <p><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b> </p>
      <p>With reference to the perspective view of the irradiation
        apparatus of the invention as shown in FIG. 1, the blood
        irradiation apparatus 10 includes a front panel 12 with a
        display 13 and power control switches 14 comprising ON/OFF main
        power switch 15, ON/OFF pump control switch 16 and ON/OFF UV
        light control switch 17, thereby providing separate power
        control to the irradiation device 10 itself as well as separate
        power control of the pump and UV light source (both components
        not shown in FIG. 1). </p>
      <p>The housing 11 of the blood irradiation apparatus 10 further
        comprises a tubular housing 18 with a partially rotatable cover
        19 opening to the rear of the housing 10 as shown in FIG. 2.
        Section 20 of housing 18 is secured in the body of housing 11 as
        illustrated in FIG. 1. Lip 21 of section 20 and lip 22 of
        rotatable cover 19 are closed on one another with cover 19 in a
        closed position as illustrated in FIG. 1. Rotatable cover 19 may
        be made of metal or, in a preferred embodiment of the invention,
        of UV plastic. UV plastic is lighter than metal, and enables the
        operator of the blood irradiator apparatus of the invention to
        observe the flow of blood through a cuvette (to be described
        with respect to FIG. 2) in an irradiation station 25 (FIG. 2)
        located beneath cover 19. Aperture 23a in section 20 provides
        egress for the conduit transporting the blood from the patient
        to the pump 24 (FIG. 2). </p>
      <p>Housing 10 and the various structural components described
        above are preferably made from metal similar to that used for
        storage cabinets. </p>
      <p>The exploded perspective view of the blood irradiator apparatus
        of FIG. 2 illustrates the relationship between the blood pump 24
        and the irradiation station 25. A cover plate 26 (shown in FIG.
        3) is removed in FIG. 2 to more clearly illustrate the pump and
        the irradiation station. Brackets 35a and 35b support respective
        opposite ends of the cover plate 26 as shown in FIG. 3. </p>
      <p>Blood from the patient is transported via a conduit (see FIG.
        3) through aperture 23a to the pump 24 and thence to a cuvette
        (not shown) mounted in irradiation station 25 by brackets 26,
        28, thereby enabling blood flowing through the cuvette to be
        irradiated by the UV light from UV light source 29. Blood from
        the cuvette is then transported via a conduit (see FIG. 3)
        through aperture 23b and returned to the patient by means well
        known to those skilled in the blood irradiation art. </p>
      <p>With cover 19 in the open position as illustrated in FIG. 2,
        access is provided to the pump 24 and the irradiation station
        for purposes of removing or servicing these components, for
        example to change the UV light source 29 or replace and position
        the cuvette in brackets 26, 28 of the irradiation station 25. </p>
      <p>The lower section 30 of housing 11 provides space for mounting
        the electrical components of the blood irradiation apparatus 10.
        Such components are illustrated by block components 31, 32 and
        33. The manner in which such electrical components are stored in
        lower section 30 forms no part of the present invention as one
        of ordinary skill in the blood irradiation art would readily
        perceive the location of such components in order to carry out
        the invention. </p>
      <p>The cross section view of FIG. 3 shows the manner in which the
        pump 24 and the irradiation station 25 including UV light source
        29 are mounted in lower section 20 of tubular housing 18.
        Shoulder 34 of pump 24 rests on cover plate 26 and is secured
        thereto by fastening means such as machine screws (not shown)
        and cover plate 26 in turn is secured to bracket 35a attached to
        the side of lower section 20. Cover plate 26 is similarly
        secured to bracket 35b at the other end of lower section 20.
        Cover plate 26 rests on support 37 which includes protrusion 38a
        for supporting support member 39a upon which is secured one end
        of bracket 26 of the irradiation station 25. Similarly the other
        end of cover plate 26 is supported on support member 39b which
        is secured to protrusion 38b. The other end of bracket 26 of the
        irradiation station is secured to support member 39b by
        fastening means 40 as shown in FIG. 3. </p>
      <p>UV light source 29 is removably retained at each end by
        respective holding elements 41a, 41b, each of which comprises a
        support 42a and 42b having respective sockets 43a and 43b.
        Electrical power is supplied to pump 24 via electrical
        conductors 44, 45. The electrical conductors for supplying power
        to the UV light source 29 are not shown in FIG. 3. </p>
      <p>Tube 46a conveys blood from the human or animal patient to the
        pump 24; tube 46b conveys blood from pump 24 to the cuvette in
        irradiation station 25; and tube 46c returns blood from the
        irradiation station 25 to the human or animal patient (not
        shown). </p>
      <p>The control circuitry 49 for controlling the UV light source 29
        and the pump 24 is shown in block diagrammatic format in FIG. 4,
        wherein both the UV light source 29 and pump 24 receive power
        through respective ON/OFF power switches 16 and 17 from power
        source 40. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, UV light
        source 29 is one of several UV light sources, each one providing
        a UV light output having an appropriate bandwidth to cover the
        respective UVA, UVB and UVC wavelengths. Control input signals
        41 from a diagnostic monitor (to be described with respect to
        FIG. 7) are input to UV control circuitry 42 so that the
        particular UV light source 29 maintains the proper light output
        amplitude (wattage). </p>
      <p>In a further modification of the present invention, a broad
        band UV light source such as a quartz lamp known to the art
        serves as the UV light source 29, and various filters each
        having a different light transmission bandwidth, for example for
        each of the UVA, UVB and UVC light bandwidths) are inserted
        within bracket 26 of irradiation station 25 (FIG. 2) to be
        positioned between the UV light source 29 and the cuvette
        through which the blood is pumped in the irradiation station. In
        this modified embodiment of the invention a select light source
        signal 43 from a control panel 44, having, for example, three
        selector switches 45, 46 and 47, on front panel 12 of the
        HEMO-IRRADIATOR.RTM. apparatus 11 of the invention (FIG. 1)
        provides a control input to UV control circuitry 42 to properly
        control the excitation to the UV light source to obtain the
        desired UV light output amplitude in accordance with the UV
        light source that is selected. </p>
      <p>In general it is possible to vary the light source intensity by
        changing either the voltage or current of a light source and
        thereby vary its radiant output. With incandescent sources such
        variation can extend over a wide range. With arc sources the
        range of variation is narrower since the arc can not be allowed
        to extinguish or the UV treatment will fail. The frequency
        output wavelengths can be adjusted by using filters or changing
        the UV light source. </p>
      <p>In a similar manner pump control circuitry 48 is powered from
        mains power source 40 and receives a select pump speed signal 49
        from pump speed select switch 50 mounted on front panel 12 of
        the HEMO-IRRADIATOR.RTM. apparatus 10 illustrated in FIG. 2.
        Speed select switch may comprise a rotatable potentiometer
        switch to provide a continuum of pump speeds. It is known that
        it is desirable that the blood flow through the cuvette in the
        irradiator station 25 be varied in accordance with the type of
        cuvette being used and the UV light output amplitude from the UV
        light source. </p>
      <p>For various physiological and/or operational reasons it may be
        desirable to increase/decrease the blood flow rate. In the
        apparatus of the present invention this variation in the blood
        flow rate is provided as a manual operation (see FIG. 4) As
        illustrated therein, there are two inputs, namely light source
        48 and pump speed 49. These inputs are reference inputs which
        are varied manually to obtain the desired blood flow rate and/or
        radiation level. </p>
      <p>Pump control circuitry also receives control input signals 51
        from the diagnostic monitor 60 (to be more fully described with
        respect to FIG. 6). </p>
      <p>In HEMO-IRRADIATOR.RTM. apparatus of the type disclosed herein
        it is desirable to determine the usage of the pump 24 and UV
        light source 29 so that, for example the pump may be removed for
        necessary maintenance and the anticipated need for replacing the
        UV light source 29 anticipated as it approaches its specified
        life cycle. To that end FIG. 5 illustrates the use of counters
        55 and 56 which are respectively sensing the current flow to UV
        light source 29 and pump 24. </p>
      <p>UV light source sensor 61 and pump sensor 62 each respectively
        sense the current and/or voltage of the UV light source 29 and
        the pump 24, respectively. These analog signals may be converted
        by A/D converters and then respectively compared with stored
        values in, for example a ROM, in diagnostic monitor 60.
        Differences between the sensed current and/or voltages and the
        stored values provide respective control signals 41 and 51 to
        the respective UV control circuitry 42 and the pump control
        circuitry 48 of FIG. 4. </p>
      <p>Thus, diagnostic monitor 60 senses the operation of the pump
        control circuit 48 and the UV control circuit 42 of FIG. 4 to
        determine if the control circuitry is working. This is important
        as improper operation of the control circuitry results in a
        failed UV blood irradiator treatment. </p>
      <p>FIG. 7 shows the digital output ports for providing digitized
        UV light source, pump and blood flow signals as generated by A/D
        conversion of the respective outputs of the UV light source,
        pump and blood flow sensors, which digitized data may be
        provided at suitable ports located on the back of the
        HEMO-IRRADIATOR.RTM. apparatus (not shown) for transmission via
        modems by telephone and/or cable to remote locations. Thus the
        respective outputs of UV light source sensor 61 and pump sensor
        62 are converted by A/D converters 65 and 66 and their
        respective digital outputs are provided to digital output ports.
        In a similar manner, the output of blood flow sensor 69 is
        converted by A/D converter 70 and provided as a digitized output
        at digital port 71. </p>
      <p>FIG. 8A is a front perspective view of first embodiment of a
        cuvette 80 capable of being used in the irradiation station 25
        (FIG. 2) of the blood irradiation apparatus of the subject
        invention and which requires a modification of the irradiation
        station to accommodate the cuvette therein, which modification
        will be described hereinafter. Cuvette 80 may have an elliptical
        or oval shape comprising a main body portion 81 and a lip 82
        extending around the periphery of body portion 81. Lip 82
        provides a means for fastening cuvette 80 in irradiation station
        25 (described hereinafter). Blood flows into cuvette 80 via
        inlet 83 and flows from the cuvette via outlet 84 (see FIG. 8B).
      </p>
      <p>The interior of cuvette 80 comprises a number of
        parallely-spaced chambers 85, 86, 87, 88 and 89 through which
        blood successively flows in alternate directions (as indicated
        by the directional arrows in FIG. 8A) from inlet 83 and entry
        port 90 to outlet port 91 and then from cuvette 80 via outlet
        84. The blood flows through chambers 85, 86, 87, 88 and 89
        within respective channels 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96 and 97.
        Each of the channels includes a respective diverter 98, 99, 100,
        101, 102, 103, 104 and 105 located at the end of each channel in
        the direction of the blood flow and each of which interrupts the
        flow of blood and causes it to drop onto an adjacent channel. </p>
      <p>The above-described construction of cuvette 80 causes the blood
        flow therein to be turbulent, thereby eliminating the tendency
        of the blood to coagulate and also providing an appropriate
        exposure of the blood from the UV source (not shown) but which
        irradiates the blood through a quartz or polymeric facing which
        covers the interior of the cuvette 80. </p>
      <p>The rear view of cuvette 80 shown in FIG. 8B illustrates back
        cover 106, main body portion 81, lip 82 and the spaced
        relationship of blood inlet 83 and blood outlet 84. </p>
      <p>The second embodiment of a cuvette illustrated in FIGS. 9A and
        9B is a preferred embodiment of the invention and may be
        disposable to eliminate the contamination of blood from one
        blood sample to the next. Cuvette 110 is an elongated hollow
        tube 112 having an oval-shaped cross-section as illustrated in
        FIG. 9B and which includes a necked-down portion 113 and 114 at
        the blood inlet 115 and blood outlet 116, respectively, thereby
        diverting the blood flow into the respective upper and lower
        halves of hollow tube 112 as shown in FIG. 9A. The Hollow tube
        section A shown in FIG. 9A is approximately 5.0" long, 1.0" wide
        (Dimension C), and each of inlet 115 and outlet 116 (dimension
        B) is approximately 1.0". </p>
      <p>FIG. 9B is a sectional view of the cuvette 110 taken along
        lines 117--117 of FIG. 9A. As illustrated in FIG. 9B, hollow
        tube 112 has inner spacing (dimension D) of approximately 0.85",
        an inner width of 0.837" (dimension E) and an outer width of
        approximately 0.96". With the above dimensions, hollow tube 112
        has a diameter of approximately 0.0615 inches (dimension
        F-dimension E) at the outer wall portions and a diameter of
        approximately 0.075" at the end portions 120, 121, 122 and 123
        (dimension C-dimension D). </p>
      <p>It is desirable that the HEMO-IRRADIATOR.RTM. apparatus of the
        present invention be capable of wide usage in different
        countries world wide and therefore it is advantageous that the
        power supply of the apparatus be capable of accepting both 110
        and 220 volt power supply inputs and transform that voltage
        input to 110 volts AC, the voltage required to operate the
        apparatus of the invention. Those of ordinary skill in the art
        of power supplies will readily recognize that such power
        transformers are available for use in the present invention,
        such that no further description of their operation is necessary
        for the present invention to be practiced. </p>
      <p>The above description serves only to describe exemplary
        embodiments of the best mode of making the HEMO-IRRADIATOR.RTM.
        apparatus of the invention and to demonstrate the features and
        advantages of its construction and operation. The invention is
        not intended to be limited thereby, as those skilled in the
        hemo-irradiator art will readily perceive modifications of the
        above-described embodiments. Thus the invention is intended to
        be limited only by the following claims and the equivalents to
        which the claimed components thereof are entitled. </p>
