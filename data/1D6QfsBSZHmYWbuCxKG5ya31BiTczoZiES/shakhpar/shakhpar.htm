      <p>In this paper the authors show the possibility of creation of a
        new kind of emanation. The magnetic monopole beam can be made in
        space as a result of focusing of some natural substances.
        Special devices based on the Moebius band elements make the
        given focusing. This emanation is able to magnetize graphite and
        organics, decrease the radioactivity, and influence the oncology
        diseases. The time reverse technology is realized in such
        devices. </p>
      <p>Experimental data, which allow making a conclusion about the
        existence of previously unknown emanation, are presented in this
        report. here are the descriptions of experiments and methods of
        measurement. The effects of interaction between the new type of
        emanation and matter have been obtained. </p>
      <p>Till the present moment theoretical physics didn't pay
        attention to the nonoriented configurations and spaces. The
        reason for this situation is the fact, that from the philosophic
        point of view it is not possible to determine and locate the are
        of the nonoriented topological structures in our world. We (8
        scientific teams) joined out forces and we needed more than 30
        years to solve this problem by an experimental approach. </p>
      <p>The fundamental tenet of the causal mechanics developed by
        Kozyrev can be formulated as follows. There are two types of
        energy in the Universe. The positive or 'right' energy acts as a
        factor of the entropy increase. The negative, or 'left' energy
        tends to decrease the entropy , i.e., it acts as a factor, which
        regulates the entropy increase. The 'right' energy is
        transformed to the 'left' one and this fact may be interpreted
        as a course of time from the past to the future. When the energy
        is transformed from the 'left' to the 'right' form, time is
        reversed. Kozyrev supposed [1] that through revolving of a body
        together with a coordinate system along a circumference the
        right coordinate system is transformed to the left one at the
        moment when the body reaches the point situated at the opposite
        side of the diameter. For example, let us take a cylinder (a
        wall of width <i>h</i>) and let is move the right coordinate
        system presented by three vectors along the external surface of
        the cylinder. We can see that in the case of such a motion the
        mirror image cannot be obtained (Figure 1, left). </p>
      <p><b>Figure 1</b> </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="fig1.jpg" height="156" width="484"></p>
      </center>
      <p>We can also proceed with the same operation after having
        bisected the cylinder and then rotate one of the edges of the
        obtained strip at the angle of 180 degrees and splice it with
        the other end. The geometric figure obtained in such a manner is
        called the one-sided cylinder or the Moebius Band (MB). In this
        case we have got the full inversion of the vectors E and H
        without having changed the direction of the propagation (Figure
        1, right). This property of the MB results in the fact, that in
        contrast with the oriented cylinder (whose width h &gt; 0 ) the
        width of the wall of the nonoriented cylinder is equal to zero
        (h=0). the so-called 'short-circuit' of the space is produced in
        such a manner. Due to this property one can observe the
        phenomenon of super-permeability, when one body can penetrate
        into another body without any interaction [2]. We can also
        expect that the signal sent from one point to another point
        under the condition of h=0 will immediately reach the receiver.
        Now let us give an explanation of such a property as the
        nonorientability (Figure 2). </p>
      <p><b>Figure 2</b> </p>
      <center><img src="fig2.jpg" height="142" width="417"></center>
      <p>Let us suppose that we move along the sides of a triangle ABC
        without changing the direction of motion. We can obtain a closed
        loop through such movement. This loop will be destroyed if we
        introduce the counter-motion (motion in the opposite direction),
        for example along the side CB. In this situation the loop can be
        restored by introducing the motion B-C, that is equivalent to
        the increase of the spatial dimensionality. Taking this fact
        into account, we can conclude that nonoriented figures may be
        considered as intermediary ones between 2, 3, or 4-space
        dimensions, depending on the dimensionality of the initial
        nonoriented figure. The entrance in the 4th dimension
        automatically means the disturbance of the space metric and it
        should result in the appearance of a gravitational field. In
        order to make the idea clear let us proceed with the
        consideration of the MB step by step (Figure 3). </p>
      <p><b>Figure 3</b> </p>
      <center><img src="fig3.jpg" height="180" width="357"></center>
      <p>At the beginning we have the initial strip ABCD. Let us turn CD
        around AB at the angle of 90 degrees and then make a projection
        of it on the surface. The rotation of the edge of this strip
        automatically transforms the figure so that it enters the
        dimension 2 + 1. The projection of the transformed figure has
        the dimension 2-1. Besides, the density of the straight line is
        considerably increased. If we proceed with the rotation of the
        strip, we will obtain a twisted figure. By projecting this
        twisted figure. By projecting this twisted figure on the surface
        (Figure 4), we will demonstrate the complete inversion of a pair
        of vectors. Having spliced the edges of the twisted figure, we
        will obtain the MB. </p>
      <p><b>Figure 4</b> </p>

      </p>
      <p><b>Figure 5</b> </p>
      <center><img src="fig5.jpg" height="169" width="259"></center>
      <p>Having considered this design we can conclude that for real MB
        models the electromagnetic fields, which have negative energy,
        will appear. Exactly in this case, when the synthesis of the
        magnetic monopole (Mon) is possible, it will be the antipode of
        the electric monopole (electron) in our 'positive' space. By
        contrast with spiral (helicoidal) movement along the surface of
        the cylinder, for the case of nonoriented figures such
        trajectories are transformed into closed knotted curves. The
        topology of such a field is presented in Figure 5 [3]. If the
        field is a magnetic one (that inevitably occurs, when the
        electric current exists in the surface layer of a conductive MB
        model) the obtained topological construction demonstrates the
        magnetic monopole structure. Really, it is similar to a
        dandelion flower with a dense central stem. That is why the MB
        can generate two types of such formations: luminous ('positive'
        energy) and black ('negative' energy). </p>
      <p>Because of the fact that the nonoriented figures are formed by
        the mutual (in pairs) cruciform conjunction of the opposite
        points, we can notice, for example, that the one-sided torus
        (the Klein bottle) is formed from half of an oriented torus; the
        formation of the models of a projective plane is created by the
        matching of the opposite points of spherical surfaces. This
        property can be explained if we suppose that the nonoriented
        fields are primary and the oriented ones are secondary. </p>
      <p><b><font size="+1">Experiment</font></b> </p>
      <p>The previous experiment with conductive MB models [4] was aimed
        at obtaining of plasma formation, which can be considered as the
        model of natural ball lightning. In the work&nbsp; [5] the
        strategy of experiment, the technologies of production of the MB
        and some results are given. The profiles of the image of a
        natural ball lightning and profiles of the formations obtained
        in the laboratory are shown at the top of Figure 6. </p>
      <p><b>Figure 6</b> </p>
      <center><img src="fig6.jpg" height="148" width="224"></center>
      <p>The recent works were focused on the discovering of the factors
        which cause the formation of such objects. As a result of this
        investigation a radiation of a new type was discovered. Because
        one MB device generates a small amount of negative energy we
        continued our research with the construction of assemblies made
        of several MBs. At the present time we created industrial
        prototypes of powerful emitters of negative energy by means of
        the developed nanotechnologies. Figure 7 shows the scheme of the
        MB assembly. </p>
      <p><b>Figure 7</b> </p>
      <center><img src="fig7.jpg" height="128" width="256"></center>
      <p>In order to keep the nonorientability of the assembly as a
        whole, one of the elements must be produced with a reversed
        twist or it should be connected in series to the circuit in
        opposition to the other elements. Because it was expected that
        the assembly can generate a powerful gravitational wave, in the
        first experiments a single thermostatic quartz resistor shielded
        from electric and magnetic fields was used as a detector. Due to
        this quartz detector the wave, which has an unknown nature, was
        discovered. In this situation the acoustic wave could be
        mistakenly detected as a gravitational one. To determine the
        nature of this wave we made an experiment to determine its
        speed. It is well known that the speed of an acoustic wave in
        the air is equal to 0.3 km/sec, depending on the density of the
        substance. The scheme of the experiental equipment is shown in
        Figure 8. Two quartz detectors are situated at the distance of 1
        meter from each other. The signals were transmitted from the
        detectors to the input of a double gun storage oscillograph. The
        measurements were made for the base of 5 meters. The results of
        the measurements are shown in Table 1. </p>
      <p><b>Figure 8</b> </p>
      <center><img src="fig8.jpg" height="155" width="262"></center>
      <p>The value of the speed of this wave allows concluding that this
        wave has gravitational nature. It is rather surprising, that the
        wave moves in the direction away from the source with some
        acceleration. Such a behavior can be explained by the generation
        of a flow of very heavy particles, which cause the distortion of
        space. However, the big speed of this wave cannot be considered
        as an absolute proof of its gravitational nature. It is
        desirable to make such an experiment, which can unambiguously
        determine the nature of the wave and its characteristics. In
        theory it is known as a phenomenon of the alteration of the
        frequency of light wave. When the light wave approaches the
        gravitational field, a photon accelerates or 'becomes a little
        more blue', but when it is moving away from a gravitational
        field, a photon 'becomes a little more red'. Such an effect can
        be used as a general principle for the proposed experiment. An
        important point is to avoid using of the complex composite
        optical systems, because they can possibly cause side effects
        and it is difficult to take them into account. That is the
        reason, why all the measurements should be made on the ray path.
        If we are able to provide the 'frequency-amplitude' conversion
        in the optic frequency band, the problem can be solved. We can
        use a light filter with a sharp characteristic curve, which is
        compatible with the wave length of the light source as such an
        element (Figure 9). </p>
      <p><b>Figure 9</b> </p>

      <p><b>Figure 10</b> </p>
      <center><img src="fig10.jpg" height="134" width="261"></center>
      <p>The scheme of the experiment is shown in Figure 10. If we
        consider the characteristic to be the function of the distance
        between the light filter and the light source and the frequency
        of 'pumping' of the MB assembly, then we can determine not only
        the gravitational potential, but also the value of the
        gravitational disturbance caused by the magnetic monopole beam.
        A simple calculation shows [6] that the space disturbance is
        equivalent to one caused by a body of the mass of 10<sup>32</sup>
        gr, i.e., a mass only 10 times smaller than the mass of the sun.
        The experimental curves, which allow making such a conclusion,
        are shown in Figure 11. </p>

      <center><img src="fig12.jpg" height="141" width="263"></center>
      <p>This experiment also discovered the effect of overlight speed
        in vacuum (Figure 12). The speed was measured by comparison of
        location of the fronts of both the working pulse and the basic
        (reference) pulse (Figure 12A), as well as by 50% modulation of
        each of the pulses (Figure 12, right top). From the comparison
        of the lengths of the measuring base and the reference base the
        conclusion that the pulse front propagates faster than light can
        be made, which is in good agreement with the theory [17].
        Besides this, when the pulse was wholly biased relatively to the
        reference pulse, there was no modulation of this pulse any
        longer, and the pulse has changed its form (Figure 12C) also in
        good agreement with the theory. When the average power of
        pumping of the MB assembly was increased up to 3 KW, this
        observation made it possible to determine that the gravitational
        wave is a scalar type wave [8]. As it was mentioned above, we
        supposed the hypothesis that the gravitational wave is not
        formed by itself, but it is caused by the interaction between
        space and the magnetic monopole beam. It was suggested that [9]
        the interaction of magnetic monopole with matter causes
        considerable ionization losses of energy of the magnetic
        monopole. Also by virtue of the fact that magnetic monopole
        accelerates even in weak magnetic fields it cannot reveal itself
        in thick layers of matter. </p>
      <p>In order to identify the magnetic nature of the flux of
        particles we used a trajectory tracking device based on the
        interaction with iron. The principle of magnetic monopole
        detecting and recording of its trajectory consists of the
        following. It is necessary to record the harmonic signal of the
        frequency of 1000 Hz on a magnetic tape. Then we should expose
        the reel to the magnetic monopole beam and then insert it in the
        tape recorder. The output of the read head is connected to the
        input of the stored oscillograph and on the screen we can see
        the information about any changes of the 1000 Hz signal. In the
        place, where the beam passed, distortion of the recorded signal
        was observed, which can unambiguously determine the nature of
        the wave and its characteristics, which proves the existence of
        intensive magnetic field in the place of interaction (Figure
        13). We found that the depth of the damages varies in the range
        from 15 mm to 150 cm. A estimated energy of the magnetic
        monopole beam amounted to 18-1800 GeV or even more. </p>
      <p><b>Figure 13</b> </p>
      <center><img src="fig13.jpg" height="135" width="198"></center>
      <p>The magnetic monopole produces some effect on different
        substances and radio components. In particular, when a measuring
        resistor was used as a detector of emanations, both the increase
        and decrease of its resistance were recorded. The increase of
        the resistance corresponded to the cooling of the resistor, and
        the decrease corresponded to its heating. The shielding of the
        detector by means of a thick iron layer resulted in cooling.
        Changes in its resistance have a long period and they are
        interesting mainly for the purpose of their demonstration. And
        for quick measurement of the parameters of magnetic monopole
        beam we have made a thermocouple detector. Design of the
        detector and the experimental curves are shown in Figure 14. </p>

      <p><b><font size="+1">Applied Research</font></b> </p>
      <p>Also applied research was made from 1991 in parallel with
        fundamental research. It became possible due to the fact that
        powerful and reliable magnetic monopole generators were created.
        it was found out, that the magnetic monopole passing through an
        organic substance transforms this substance in such a manner,
        that it shows paramagnetic properties in external magnetic
        fields of 1-1.5 Tesla intensity. The new property can be kept
        for a long time [5]. We succeeded in establishing the fact that
        carbon is the element responsible for the appearance of these
        new properties. The effect of the magnetic monopole beam both on
        carbon (Figure 15) and diamond samples gave us the fact, that
        these samples show new properties slightly different from each
        other. The carbon clearly showed a soft magnetic characteristic,
        and the diamond showed magnetic properties only when it was
        attracted by a steel needle in the magnetic field (Figure 16). </p>
      <p><b>Figure 15</b> </p>

      <p><b>Figure 16</b> </p>
      <center><img src="fig16.jpg" height="174" width="215"></center>
      <p>At the first moment after the magnetizing of the diamond we
        observed the own residual magnetism of the diamond, but this
        property wanes and disappears in several days and the diamond
        remains paramagnetic. From the practical point of view it is
        quite interesting to identify chemical reaction taking place
        both in the field of the beam and in its surroundings. We could
        considerably improve the quality of both juices and alcohol
        drinks (wine, cognac, brandy, liqueur, vodka, etc.). At the same
        time the new properties of the processed alcohol drinks are kept
        for an indefinitely long time, the production expenses are very
        small. Considerable success also was achieved in medicine.
        Research made in the Oncological Center at the Academy of
        Medical Sciences of the Russian Federation showed that the
        magnetic monopole beam is absolutely harmless for living
        organisms and at the same time this emanation produces positive
        effects during the medical treatment of blood diseases.
        Oncological diseases may also be treated either directly by the
        magnetic monopole beam or accompanied by other well known means
        of influence. Attempts were also made [5] in order to develop
        methods of control on the radio nuclide decay. </p>

        of super permeability, generation of gravitational waves,
        magnetizing of objects processed by the magnetic monopole beam,
        considerable penetration capability of the beam, phenomenon of
        magnetic cooling of mater by its interaction with the beam, we
        think that the existence of the magnetic monopole may be
        considered to be a proven fact. At the same time taking into
        account the relation between the energies of the obtained
        particles and the energy spent to obtain them&nbsp; (300 eV) we
        should conclude that our generator does not create the magnetic
        monopole beam, but it only produces focusing of some natural
        emanation. </p>
      <p>Taking into account that N.A. Kozyrev was the first who
        observed magnetic monopole emanation in nature, and the
        existence of magnetic monopole was theoretically predicted by
        Dirac, we gave the following name to the new discovered
        emanation: Kozyrev-Dirac Emanation. </p>

        <p><b><font size="+1">I. Shakhparonov</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>While investigating the properties of plasma fireball
        formations produced by a laboratory method [1], the author has
        come to a conclusion that there exists an earlier unknown factor
        responsible for their abnormally long life. In 1996 a new
        radiation presumably consisting of magnetic monopoles was
        discovered [2] which the author named the "Kozyrev-Dirac
        radiation (KDR)". Unlike all other known types of radiation, the
        KDR cools a substance on interaction with it. This feature of
        the KDR can explain the existing contradiction between the
        observable low superficial temperature of a globe lightning and
        the energy liberation on its explosion. </p>
      <p>On proving a magneto-monopole origin of globe lightnings, the
        author with associates have found that a magnetic monopole,
        accelerated in the magnetic field, according to the theoretical
        works by Rubakov [3], can interact with nuclei of the excited
        (radioactive) substance [4], thus liberating additional energy.
        It is exactly these circumstances that a long active life of
        globe lightnings in nature can be ascribed to. </p>
