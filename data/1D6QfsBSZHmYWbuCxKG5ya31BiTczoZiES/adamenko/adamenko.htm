        <p>Welcome to Electrodynamics Laboratory "Proton-21" --- the
          pioneer in a new field of nuclear physics and of the new
          method and installation for laboratory nucleosynthesis. <br>
          Laboratory </p>
        <p>Advancements over the span of the last fifty years in many
          fields of scientific and technological research such as
          Genetics, Physics, Telecommunications and other fields has
          outperformed progress in the field of Power Generation and
          Decontamination of Radioactive wastes. Progress in the fields
          of controlled thermonuclear synthesis and radioactive wastes
          decontamination technology also lag in comparison despite
          investments in research by the developed nations exceeding USD
          100 billion. </p>
        <p>One key issue that remains unresolved to this date in this
          particular field of research is the development of processes
          and technology for controlled ignition of self-sustaining
          nuclear reactions. For this, an adequate "initiator" of such
          controlled nuclear transformations is required; one which will
          result in a sustainable and controlled energy output and the
          transmutation of radioactive atoms into stable ones. </p>
        <p>ElectroDynamics Lab (EDL) was founded in Kiev, Ukraine in
          1999 by a group of Ukrainian engineers and scientists to
          address the specific problem of the adequate initiator. EDL's
          primary mission statement was to develop a novel, safe and
          effective technology for radioactive wastes decontamination.
          Today, privately funded EDL has evolved into a leading edge
          Research and Development center employing in excess of 120
          researchers and scientists. The proven results of its research
          and its proprietary process, currently being patented, are
          able today to address the unresolved issue of nuclear wastes
          transformation. </p>
        <p>EDL's results are revolutionary in their nature and are
          leading to important commercial and industrial breakthrough
          applications. </p>
        <p>Primary Focus of EDL's Research: </p>
        <p>The primary focus of EDL's research is based on a newly
          developed and self sustainable process which leads, through a
          controlled stimulation, to the collapse of condensed matter.
          In this collapsed state thus created, the effect of the
          Coulomb barrier becomes insignificant, and a rapid
          transmutation of elements and isotopes occurs and can be
          observed. </p>
        <p>Main Research Results: </p>
        <p>The first successful experiment was performed on February 24,
          2000 in a specially created and proprietary set up. In fact,
          the 5,000+ successful experiments in controlled
          nuclei-synthesis performed since 1999, using various targets
          made of light, medium, or heavy elements; have allowed the
          research team at EDL to comprehend and evaluate this unique
          scientific breakthrough. <br>
          The discovered process has been noted for its practical,
          environmentally friendly and extraordinary energy efficient
          attributes. </p>
        <p>Two major outcomes have emerged from this process: </p>
        <p>First, the creation of an energy output far exceeding the
          initial impact. </p>
        <p>Second, the creation of an array of unique nuclei-synthesis
          elements. These new elements were tested by leading scientific
          laboratories in Ukraine, Russia, USA, etc, and their
          artificial origin was confirmed. </p>
        <p>The obtained results confirm the following: </p>
        <p>The technological process created and validated by EDL is a
          unique and a pioneer experimental technology. It achieves
          record-breaking conditions for multiparticle nuclear
          fusion-fission reactions in condensed matter. </p>
        <p>The laboratory installation developed by EDL has achieved
          high reproducibility results in reaching appropriate
          conditions in a compressed format necessary for the ignition
          of the collective multiparticle fusion-fission reactions. </p>
        <p>The new elements resulting from the nuclceosynthesis created
          by the EDL process are free of ?-, ?-, ?-, -active isotopes.
          The radiation intensity of the products never exceeds the
          background intensity. </p>
        <p>Elements marked with radioactive isotopes had their activity
          reduced due to full nuclear rebirth of a portion of the target
          element after the high energy impact. </p>
        <p>The presence of long living isotopes in super heavy elements,
          on the border and beyond the Periodic Table, was revealed by
          the nuclear transmutation. These were synthesized in
          quantities many times exceeding those principally gained by
          classic methods at much reduced energy costs. </p>
        <p>Objectives: </p>
        <p>EDL's immediate objective is to finalize the pilot project of
          a new industrial prototype hundred times exceeding the
          performance of the existing laboratory setup. </p>
        <p>EDL intends to continue and expand its research work in new
          fields of nuclear physics: including a) laboratory
          astrophysics, b) physics of collective synergetic interactions
          of previously unknown mechanisms, and c) energy creation and
          transformation processes. </p>
        <p>EDL intends to develop a series of unique, radiation safe,
          and environmentally appropriate, industrial technologies to be
          used in commercial applications.<br>

        <p align="left">By subjecting a copper electrode to a gigawatt
          pulse of energy, Dr. Stanislav Adamenko believes that he's
          found a new form of fusion that occurs inside a millimeter
          sized plasma that forms in the electrode. Has Adamenko finally
          cracked the code for solid-state fusion, and what potential
          for future energy does it hold? He joins us for the inside

        <p align="left">"Simply put, we're dealing with physical
          processes that exhibit a strongly nonlinear dependence. A good
          example to consider is the amount of the excess energy
          released in a LENR reaction versus the amount of the active
          substance involved in the experiment-- this is something that
          we've examined extensively in our own experimental research. </p>
        <p align="left">This nonlinear dependence explains why the
          majority of well-known LENR experiments demonstrate such
          extremely small yields in terms of energy production &amp;
          nucleosynthesis, as well as why the results are so difficult
          to replicate or even accurately identify when they occur. </p>
        <p align="left">I'm sure that in the next five to ten years,
          collective &amp; coherent nuclear reactions will become the
          focus of major investment in the field of nuclear-energy
          research, and it will lead to the beginning of a large-scale
          transition to a new, environmentally-friendly means of
          producing energy based on collective natural nuclear
          transformations." - Dr. Stanislav Adamenko </p>

            <p>Abstract --- A method of compressing a substance by
              impact in axisymmetric relativistic vacuum diodes (RVD)
              having a plasma cathode and an anode-enhancer including:
              producing an axisymmetric target of a condensed substance,
              which functions at least as a part of the anode-enhancer;
              axially placing said electrodes; and pulse discharge of a
              power source via the RVD. To compress a substantial
              portion of the target substance to a superdense state, a
              plasma cathode is used in the form of a current-conducting
              rod comprising a dielectric end element having the
              perimeter of the rear end embracing the perimeter of the
              rod in the plane perpendicular to the axis of symmetry
              with a continuous gap, and the area of the emitting
              surface being greater than the maximum cross-section area
              of the anode-enhancer; the anode-enhancer is placed
              towards the plasma cathode so that the center of curvature
              of the working surface of the anode enhancer is located
              inside the focal space of the collectively self focussing
              electron beam; and the anode-enhancer is acted upon by an
              electron beam with an electron energy not smaller than 0.2
              MeV, current density not smaller than 106 A/cm2 and
              duration not greater than 100 ns. </p>

            <p>Description </p>
            <p>FIELD OF INVENTION </p>
            <p>[0001] This invention relates: </p>
            <p>[0002] to a method for impact compression of a condensed
              (liquid or, preferably, solid) substance to a superdense
              state in which pycnonuclear processes and inertial
              confinement fusion (ICF hereafter) may proceed, and </p>
            <p>[0003] to a structure of devices based on relativistic
              vacuum diodes (RVD hereafter) including plasma cathodes,
              designed for carrying out the said method. </p>
            <p>[0004] This technology is intended practically for
              transmutation of atomic nuclei of certain chemical
              elements into nuclei of other chemical elements with the
              purpose of: </p>
            <p>[0005] Experimentally obtaining preferably stable
              isotopes of chemical elements including synthesis of
              stable transuranides; </p>
            <p>[0006] Reprocessing radioactive waste containing
              long-lived isotopes into materials containing short-lived
              isotopes and/or stable isotopes, which is particularly
              important in decontamination of used gamma-ray sources,
              e.g., based on radioactive isotopes of cobalt widely used
              in industry and medicine. </p>
            <p>[0007] In future, this method may be useful for obtaining
              energy by the ICF with utilization of preferably solid
              targets. </p>
            <p>[0008] For the purpose of this description, the following
              terms as employed herein and in the appended claims refer
              to the following concepts: </p>
            <p>[0009] "target" is a once used for impact compression
              dose of at least one arbitrary isotope of at least one
              chemical element, being a raw material for obtaining
              products of nuclear transformations and, optionally, a
              primary energy carrier for energy producing; </p>
            <p>[0010] "impact compression" is an isoentropic impact
              action of a self-focusing converging density wave on at
              least a part of a target; </p>
            <p>[0011] "superdense state" is such a state of at least a
              part of the target after it has been compressed by impact,
              at which state a substantial portion of the target
              substance transforms into electron-nuclear and
              electron-nucleonic plasma; </p>
            <p>[0012] "pycnonuclear process" is such a recombinational
              interaction (`cold` in particular) between components of
              electron-nuclear and electron-nucleonic plasma of the
              target substance compressed to a superdense state causing
              at least the target isotopic composition change; </p>
            <p>[0013] "plasma cathode" is such a consumable axisymmetric
              part of the RVD negative electrode which is able (in the
              beginning of the discharge pulse) to generate plasma shell
              (of the material of the near-surface layer) with the near
              zero electron work function; </p>
            <p>[0014] "anode-enhancer" is such once used replaceable
              axisymmetric part of the RVD anode which may be completely
              produced of preferably conductive (in the main) material
              and used as a target itself in the simplest demonstration
              experiments, or has the shape of at least a single-layer
              shell of a hard strong material inside of which a selected
              target is fixed also axisymmetrically providing the
              acoustic contact, when such anode-enchancer is used for
              industrial needs; </p>
            <p>[0015] "focal space" is such a volume in the RVD vacuum
              chamber which spatially confines a certain length of the
              common geometric symmetry axis of the RVD electrodes and
              in which (in the absence of obstacles and under pre-set
              values of the area of the emitting surface of the plasma
              cathode, energy of electrons and current density) a pinch
              of electron beam is possible due to collective
              self-focussing of relativistic electrons. </p>
            <p>BACKGROUND ART </p>
            <p>[0016] It is well known theoretically (see, e.g., U.S.
              Pat. No. 4,401,618) that in order to carry out a
              controlled nuclear fusion, it is necessary and sufficient:
            </p>
            <p>[0017] First, to make a target of a microscopic size, the
              mass of which is usually of several micrograms to several
              milligrams, </p>
            <p>[0018] Second, to fix the formed target in a space, </p>
            <p>[0019] Third, to transfer a target substance into a
              superdense state by as uniform as possible impact
              compression of the target, </p>
            <p>[0020] Fourth, to hold the substance of the target in
              such state the time enough for transmutation and/or
              nuclear fusion of atoms, which can be accompanied by
              energy release or absorption. </p>
            <p>[0021] Worth to be mentioned that said limitations of the
              target mass are important mainly for the ICF because 1 mg
              of deuterium or a mixture of deuterium and tritium has an
              energy equivalent of about 20-30 kg of trinitrotoluene. </p>
            <p>[0022] Also theoretically obvious is the fact that
              transmutation and/or nuclear fusion occur actually
              simultaneously with the attainment of a superdense state.
              Therefore, the efforts of researchers in the field of
              nuclear physics have been directed to the creation of most
              efficient methods and means for impact compression of
              substances so far. </p>
            <p>[0023] And, finally, it is also theoretically clear that:
            </p>
            <p>[0024] such a compression is possible only under the
              conditions of generating a high-power mechanical impulse
              of the duration order of several tens of nanoseconds and
              focussing this impulse onto a substantial area (up to the
              whole) of the surface of a target located in a securely
              isolated from the environment volume, </p>
            <p>[0025] means for space-time compression of an energy flux
              are required for that purpose, such as primary energy
              source, at least one energy storage, at least one
              converter for transforming the accumulated energy into a
              mechanical impact impulse, and a mechanical striker for
              essentially isoentropic transfer of this impulse onto the
              target, </p>
            <p>[0026] the problem of a sufficient set of such means and
              interactions between them can be solved in different ways
              depending on the purposes of the experiments with the
              impact compression of a substance provided that (when
              connected to an industrial power network) the first but
              not the only energy storage is usually a device based on a
              LC-circuit (see, e.g., collected articles: Energy Storage,
              Compression and Switching, edited by W. H. Bostick, V.
              Nardy and O. S. F. Zucker. Plenum Press, New York and
              London). </p>
            <p>[0027] For years, efforts to realize said theoretical
              assumptions in practice had been directed only to the ICF
              the industrial mastering of which seemed to be sufficient
              for the humanity to move to "energy paradise". </p>
            <p>[0028] For this reason, only gaseous deuterium or
              deuterium and tritium were used as an active substance
              from the very beginning, and targets were produced in the
              shape of tight empty spheres filled with microscopic
              (about 0,1 mg) portions of said hydrogen isotopes. Then,
              the beams of laser drivers were pointed at each such
              target uniformly and synchronously from many sides. </p>
            <p>[0029] Heating of the shell caused an ablation (partial
              evaporation) of its outer portion. The expansion of the
              evaporated material was giving rise to reactive forces
              which caused implosion, i.e. uniform compression of the
              inner portion of the shell and active substance of the
              target in the direction to the sphere center (see, e.g.,
              (1) U.S. Pat. No. 4,401,618; (2) J. Lindl, Phys. of
              Plasmas, 1995; (3) K. Mima et al., Fusion Energy, 1996.
              IAEA, Vienna, V. 3, p. 13, 1996). </p>
            <p>[0030] This ICF scheme seemed to be irreproachable.
              Actually, the duration of laser radiation pulses can be
              brought to about 1 ns. This could ensure efficient time
              compression of an energy flux, and a sharp decrease in the
              target surface area could be a prerequisite for the space
              compression of said flux as well. </p>
            <p>[0031] Unfortunately, the efficiency of lasers does not
              exceed 5%, that from very beginning made doubtable the
              effectiveness of the laser driver, taking into account
              Lawson criterion (J. D. Lawson, Proc. Phys. Soc., B.70,
              1957). Further, the synchronization of lasers switching
              requires a sophisticated automatic control system. And,
              finally, the ablation is accompanied with significant
              losses in energy for heating the shell and target as a
              whole. Thus, nobody has brought so far the gaseous
              substance of the target to the superdense state and has
              got a positive yield of energy that could exceed the
              energy consumption for ICF initiation. </p>
            <p>[0032] Known are the efforts to create the pressure and
              temperature sufficient to ignite fusion reactions by means
              of an acoustic driver, which must to induce cavitation in
              condensed, liquid in particular, targets (U.S. Pat. Nos.
              4,333,796; 5,858,104 and 5,659,173). Particularly,
              International Publication WO 01/39197 describes: </p>
            <p>[0033] (1) a cavitation fusion reactor comprising: </p>
            <p>[0034] at least one source of mechanical supersonic
              oscillations, </p>
            <p>[0035] preferably a plurality of sound conductors capable
              of transmitting these oscillations into the confined body
              of a target in a resonance mode with an increase in the
              energy flux density per unit of area, </p>
            <p>[0036] means for heat removal in the form of a suitable
              heat exchanger; </p>
            <p>[0037] (2) such method of use of the described reactor,
              which includes: </p>
            <p>[0038] producing targets poorly conducting sound by
              pressing a fuel material required for nuclear fusion,
              preferably titanium deuteride, or lithium deuteride, or
              gadolinium dideuteride, etc., into a solid sound
              conducting matrix from a refractory metal (e.g. titanium,
              tungsten, gadolinium, osmium or molybdenum), introducing
              at least one such matrix with at least one such target
              into acoustic contact with at least one sound conductor
              connected to the source of mechanical supersonic
              oscillations, </p>
            <p>[0039] acting upon such matrix by a train of supersonic
              impulses in a resonance mode, which acting causes
              mechanical-and-chemical destruction of deuterides and
              fluidization of targets due to the conversion of kinetic
              energy of the mechanical oscillations into the heat and
              essentially simultaneously induces cavitation in the
              `liquid` targets due to `evaporation` of deuterium from
              the targets, i.e. appearance of vapor bubbles and their
              collapse under the pressure of the host material, and </p>
            <p>[0040] terminating the process after nuclear fusion
              reactions with energy release inside the targets are
              completed. </p>
            <p>[0041] Use of solid (in the initial state) targets and
              supersonic mechanical impulses for their impact
              compression seems to be rather attractive. Unfortunately,
              like lasers, the sources of ultrasound have insignificant
              efficiency. Moreover, unlike lasers, these sources yield
              rather small density of power in the impulse, which makes
              it necessary to put the system `ultrasound
              source--deuteride target` in the resonance mode. However,
              even in this mode, the major portion of energy is spent
              for heating targets and dissipates. Therefore, impact
              compression of the substance to a superdense state was not
              achieved even in case of prolonged pumping of energy into
              the target. </p>
            <p>[0042] Accordingly, the problem of creation of feasible
              methods and means for impact compression of the substance
              to a superdense state remains urgent. </p>
            <p>[0043] Long-range approach to its solution is based on
              use of RVD known since the beginning of the 20.sup.th
              century (see, e.g., (1) C. D. Child, Phys. Rev., V. 32, p.
              492, 1911; (2)1. Langmuir, Phys. Rev., V. 2, p. 450,
              1913). </p>
            <p>[0044] Each RVD comprises a vacuum chamber inside of
              which a cathode and an anode are fixed, said cathode and
              anode are connected to an electric charge storage via a
              pulse discharger. With a sufficiently great charge and a
              short duration of a discharge pulse, such diodes are
              capable of providing an explosive electron emission from
              the surface of the cathode and acceleration of electrons
              to relativistic velocity with the efficiency of more than
              90%. </p>
            <p>[0045] Exactly in this function of generators and
              accelerators of powerful electron beams, the relativistic
              vacuum diodes had been the object of attention of
              physicists during the whole 20.sup.th century, and
              numerous enhancements to the design of such diodes as the
              whole and particularly cathodes for them were intended for
              the space-time compression of energy in the electron beams
              and shaping these beams to required spatial form. </p>
            <p>[0046] An effort in creation of a method for compressing
              a substance by impact in the RVD for ICF is known from
              U.S. Pat. No. 3,892,970. This method includes: </p>
            <p>[0047] First, producing a target in the shape of a
              symmetric pellet of a condensed (preferably solid)
              substance from a frozen thermonuclear fuel (i.e. deuterium
              or a mixture of deuterium and tritium), </p>
            <p>[0048] Second, placing the target between the RVD
              electrodes, in other words, into the volume, into which
              the output of means for anode plasma generation is opened,
              and </p>
            <p>[0049] Third, practically synchronous injection an anode
              plasma and compression of the target with impulse (at 10
              ns) annular impact by means of short-circuit of a powerful
              current (the order of 100 TW and the energy of 1 MJ) via
              the anode plasma. </p>
            <p>[0050] However, such method does not provide the
              compression of the target substance to a superdense state
              and holding it in such state long enough for nuclear
              fusion with energy release because the size of the target
              is obviously smaller than the path length of the electrons
              with the energy of about 1.5 MeV. That is why the kinetic
              energy of electrons practically immediately converts into
              thermal energy in the whole body of the target causing a
              spatial thermal explosion of the nuclear fuel. Further, it
              is extremely difficult in the known method to synchronize
              hitting of the freely flying target into the center of an
              annular RVD cathode with the discharge of the source of
              energy and producing a flat plasma anode. Accordingly,
              focussing of the electron current on the target can be
              achieved only occasionally despite of adjusting the
              discharge voltage and the anode plasma density. </p>
            <p>[0051] An RVD based device for impact compression of a
              substance, known from the same patent, comprises a
              spherical vacuum chamber fitted with a heat exchanger and
              provided with a channel for targets feeding, two annular
              cathodes located symmetrically with respect to the central
              plane of the vacuum chamber, additional plasma injecting
              device located between the cathodes and forming a flat
              plasma anode directly prior to the discharge of the
              supplying circuit. </p>
            <p>[0052] And finally, the known from the same patent
              cathode has a current carrying part and a focussing tip
              made in the shape of a ring with a sharp edge for
              increasing an electric field gradient thereon. The edge of
              such cathode is covered with its own layer of plasma
              during a discharge. </p>
            <p>[0053] It is actually impossible to transfer a tangible
              portion of energy of the annular electron beam to the
              target in such RVD, because the beam is already on the
              pinch threshold at the very moment of its formation and is
              unstable (especially in combination with such plasma
              anode, which parameters change essentially both during
              each pulse and from one pulse to another). </p>
            <p>[0054] Therefore, it is desirable that the anode should
              be made from solid substance and either itself functions
              as a target or incorporates a target, and that the pinch
              should be prevented in the gap between the electrodes and
              self-focussing of the electron beam be achieved on the
              anode surface simultaneously in the process of the
              discharge. </p>
            <p>[0055] It is astonishing, that, according to the
              available data, main attention in development of such
              means was paid only to shaping the RVD cathode emitters
              while using essentially flat anodes. A striking example of
              such approach can be a RVD based pulse source of electrons
              that comprises a plasma cathode having a shaped plate of a
              dielectric material and a conductive cover of precisely
              the same shape for a portion of the surface of said plate
              (SU 1545826 A1). Under a pulse discharge, such a composite
              cathode can generate an electron beam, which is not
              subject to the pinch and has the shape that corresponds to
              the shape of the dielectric plate. </p>
            <p>[0056] However, such as much as possible uniform
              compression of the target, which is necessary for the ICF
              and pycnonuclear processes, is unachievable by shaping the
              electron beam only. Therefore, the described RVD and its
              analogues can not be feasibly applied in the processes of
              impact compression of a substance up to a superdense
              state. </p>
            <p>[0057] Problems in suppressing the pinch in the gap
              between the electrodes and in providing the self-focussing
              of electron beams on the target surface made many
              physicists so pessimistic that they came to a conclusion
              of principal inapplicability of RVD's as drivers for
              transmutation processes and ICF (see, e.g., (1) James J.
              Duderstadt, Gregory Moses, Inertial Confinement Fusion.
              John Wiley and Sons, New York, 1982. (2) E. P. Velikhov,

              Controlled Fusion/http://relcom.website.ru/wfs-moscow.
              etc). </p>
            <p>[0058] Nevertheless, the research in this direction
              continued. </p>
            <p>[0059] Thus, the nearest to the invention, as for the
              technical essence, method and means that are in principle
              applicable for impact compression of a substance were
              disclosed at International Conference dedicated to
              particle accelerators (S. Adamenko, E. Bulyak et al.
              Effect of Auto-focusing of the Electron Beam in the
              Relativistic Vacuum Diode. In: Proceedings of the 1999
              Particle Accelerator Conference, New York, 1999) and in a
              later article (V. I. Vysotski, S. V. Adamenko et al.

              Relativistic Electrons. Nuclear Instruments and Methods in
              Physics Research A 455, 2000, pp. 123-127). </p>
            <p>[0060] Method of impact compression of a substance, which
              can be easily perceived by those skilled in the art from
              the above-mentioned sources of information, includes: </p>
            <p>[0061] producing a target in the shape of such an
              axisymmetric part from a condensed substance that is at
              least a part of a RVD anode (namely, in the shape of a
              hemispheric tip of a needle-like anode-enhancer having a
              diameter of the order of several micrometers), </p>
            <p>[0062] placing the target in the RVD fitted also with an
              axisymmetric plasma cathode, which is located practically
              on the same geometric axis with said anode-enhancer and is
              spaced by several millimeters therefrom, and </p>
            <p>[0063] pulse discharge of the power source via the RVD in
              the self-focussing mode of an electron beam on the surface
              of the anode-enhancer. </p>
            <p>[0064] Device using the described method for impact
              compression of a substance was made on the basis of a RVD.
              It comprises: </p>
            <p>[0065] a strong gas-tight housing a part of which is made
              of a current-conducting material shaped in axial symmetry
              to confine a vacuum chamber, and </p>
            <p>[0066] an axisymmetric plasma cathode and an axisymmetric
              anode-enhancer fixed in said chamber practically on the
              same geometric axis of which at least plasma cathode is
              connected to a pulsed high-voltage power source. </p>
            <p>[0067] The cathode was made in accordance with a
              classical scheme: `current-conducting (usually metallic)
              rod converging in the direction to the anode ended with
              dielectric element`, the perimeter and the area of the
              operative end of the latter element being no greater than
              the respective perimeter and the cross section of said rod
              (Mesyats G. A. Cathode Phenomena in a Vacuum Discharge:
              The Breakdown, the Spark and the Arc. Nauka Publishers,
              Moscow, 2000, p. 60). </p>
            <p>[0068] Shaping the both electrodes in the specific
              geometric forms allowed the pinch to be suppressed in the
              RVD gap, and to sharpen the electron beam to provide it's
              self-focussing on a small portion of the surface of the
              anode-enhancer. </p>
            <p>[0069] However, such essentially point action on the
              anode-enhancer is suitable only for demonstration of the
              RVD applicability for impact compression of a substance,
              but it cannot provide the compression of a substantial
              portion of the target body to a superdense state at each
              pulse discharge. </p>
            <p>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </p>
            <p>[0070] Therefore, the invention is based on the problem:
            </p>
            <p>[0071] First, by way of changing the conditions of
              performing the steps, to create such a method for impact
              compression of an essential portion of the target
              substance to a superdense state that could be fulfilled at
              each pulsed RVD discharge, </p>
            <p>[0072] Second, by way of changing the shapes and relative
              positions of electrodes in RVD, to create such a device
              for compressing a substance by impact, which would ensure
              effective application of the method, and </p>
            <p>[0073] Third, by way of changing the shapes and dimension
              ratios of conductive and dielectric parts, to create such
              an axisymmetric plasma cathode which would provide the
              most economic effective application of the method. </p>
            <p>[0074] The first aspect of the problem is solved so that
              in the method of compressing a substance by impact using a
              RVD having an axisymmetric vacuum chamber with
              current-conducting walls, an axisymmetric plasma cathode
              and an axisymmetric anode-enhancer, including: </p>
            <p>[0075] producing a target in the shape of an axisymmetric
              part of a condensed substance that functions as at least a
              part of the anode-enhancer, </p>
            <p>[0076] placing the anode-enhancer into the RVD chamber
              with a gap towards the plasma cathode practically on the
              same geometric axis therewith, and </p>
            <p>[0077] pulse discharge of the power source via the RVD in
              the electron beam self-focussing mode on the surface of
              the anode-enhancer, according to the invention </p>
            <p>[0078] the axisymmetric plasma cathode is used in the
              form of a current-conducting rod comprising a dielectric
              end element having the perimeter of the rear end embracing
              the perimeter of said rod at least in the plane
              perpendicular to the axis of symmetry of the cathode with
              a continuous gap, and the area of the emitting surface
              being greater than the maximum cross-section area of the
              anode-enhancer, </p>
            <p>[0079] the anode-enhancer is placed with such a gap
              towards the plasma cathode that the center of curvature of
              the working surface of the anode-enhancer is located
              inside the focal space of the collectively self-focussing
              electron beam, and </p>
            <p>[0080] the anode-enhancer is acted upon by an electron
              beam having the electron energy not less than 0.2 MeV,
              current density not less than 10.sup.6 A/cm.sup.2 and
              duration not greater than 100 ns. </p>
            <p>[0081] The results of application of this method happen
              to be quite unexpected even for the inventor who had been
              striving for them more than 10 years. Thus, using the
              simplest monometallic targets of highly pure copper,
              tantalum and other materials enabled to demonstrate
              experimentally the following: </p>
            <p>[0082] after being compressed by impact, a tangible
              portion of each target mass flew apart and precipitated as
              aggregates of transmutation products on the walls of the
              RVD vacuum chamber and/or on a shield mentioned below; </p>
            <p>[0083] some aggregates were rather homogeneous as for
              their elemental composition; </p>
            <p>[0084] in the aggregates were certainly detected not only
              stable isotopes of known chemical elements which had not
              been present in the substance of the targets as admixtures
              but also relatively stable isotopes of unknown now and not
              yet identified transuranides; </p>
            <p>[0085] isotopic composition of the products of
              transmutation of the target substance essentially differed
              from the reference data on the isotopic composition of the
              same elements in the Earth's crust, </p>
            <p>[0086] the attempts to detect positive yield of thermal
              energy from the zone of transmutation failed up to now. </p>
            <p>[0087] The above distinguishes the transmutation
              according to the invention in essence from the traditional
              transmutation attained by bombardment of solid targets
              (e.g., made from the same copper or molybdenum) by ions
              (deuterons as a rule) produced from sources with
              magnetically confined anode plasma and run in complicated
              and dangerous in operation pulse accelerators to obtain
              power fluxes of the order of 1 kW at the ion energy of
              more than 5 MeV (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,848,110). In
              fact, only known in advance mainly radioactive isotopes of
              known in advance chemical elements, e.g., Zn.sup.65,
              Mo.sup.99, I.sup.123, O.sup.15, etc. can be produced in
              such processes, whereas the method according to the
              invention is applicable at least for fusion of
              transuranides in quantities sufficient for chemical study.
            </p>
            <p>[0088] Mentioned above and described in detail below
              results of carrying out the method according to the
              invention allow to suppose that the electron beam is
              collectively self-focussing on a essential portion of the
              surface of the anode-enhancer and excite in its
              near-surface layer a mechanical soliton-like density
              impulse converging to the symmetry axis of the target.
              This impulse transmits in the isoentropic manner the
              energy received from the electron beam to a portion of the
              target substance near its symmetry axis. The leading edge
              of said impulse tends to a spherical form. Therefore, as
              the soliton-like impulse reduces to a certain small volume
              with the center on the target symmetry axis, its leading
              edge becomes steeper, and the density of energy therein
              increases to a magnitude sufficient for the substance to
              reach a superdense state enough for pycnonuclear processes
              to proceed. That is the reason why the simplest (and, what
              is very important, practically safe in operation) RVD type
              electron accelerator with a minimum power consumption
              provides (as will be shown in detail below) the
              transmutation nuclear reactions with the yield of a wide
              spectrum of isotopes. </p>
            <p>[0089] The first additional feature consists in that used
              in the relativistic vacuum diode plasma cathode has a
              pointed current-conducting rod, the dielectric end element
              of this cathode is provided with an opening for setting on
              said rod, and the setting part of said rod together with
              the pointed end is located inside the opening. This allows
              to control at least partially the gap between the RVD
              electrodes and to stabilize the plasma cathode operation,
              that is especially important for experimental optimization
              of the impact compression process. </p>
            <p>[0090] The second additional feature consists in that the
              target is formed in the shape of an insert into the
              central part of the RVD anode-enhancer, the diameter of
              said insert is chosen in the range of 0.05 to 0.2 of the
              maximum cross-sectional dimension of the anode-enhancer.
              This allows to use any material as an object of
              compression to a superdense state irrespective of its
              electric conductivity and its usage both in a solid and a
              liquid state. Naturally, a liquid should be encapsulated
              either directly in the solid shell of the anode-enhancer
              or in an individual shell, which, after closure, must be
              inserted with the maximal acoustic transparency into the
              anode-enhancer. </p>
            <p>[0091] The third additional feature consists in that at
              least that part of the anode-enhancer, which is directed
              to the plasma cathode, is spheroidally formed prior to
              mounting in the RVD. This allows the mechanical
              soliton-like impulse of density to be concentrated in a
              microscopically small volume and, as a result of this
              concentration, to provide the impact compression of an
              each target substance up to a superdense state with a
              yield of 10.sup.17 to 10.sup.18 atoms of transmuted
              products even with the minimum (the order of 300-1000 J)
              energy consumption for a single `shot`. </p>
            <p>[0092] The fourth additional feature consists in that the
              target is formed in the shape of a spheroidal body tightly
              fixed inside the anode-enhancer in such a way that the
              centers of the inner and outer spheroids practically
              coincide. This allows to increase essentially the yield of
              a transmuted material. </p>
            <p>[0093] The fifth additional feature consists in that the
              anode-enhancer is acted upon by an electron beam having
              the electron energy up to 1.5 MeV, current density not
              greater than 10.sup.8 A/cm.sup.2 and duration not greater
              than 50 ns. These parameters are sufficient for
              pycnonuclear processes to proceed in targets consisting of
              the most stable atoms of chemical elements from the
              `middle part` of the periodic table. </p>
            <p>[0094] The sixth additional feature consists in that the
              current density of the electron beam is not more than
              10.sup.7 A/cm.sup.2, which is sufficient for effective
              impact compression of the majority of condensed target
              materials. </p>
            <p>[0095] The seventh additional feature consists in that
              the residual pressure in the RVD vacuum chamber is
              maintained at the level not greater than 0.1 Pa, which is
              quite sufficient to prevent a gas discharge between the
              RVD electrodes. </p>
            <p>[0096] The second aspect of the problem is solved in that
              in a device for impact compression of a substance, which
              is based on RVD and is comprised of: </p>
            <p>[0097] a strong gas-tight housing a part of which is made
              of a current-conducting material shaped in axial symmetry
              to confine a vacuum chamber, and </p>
            <p>[0098] an axisymmetric plasma cathode and an axisymmetric
              anode-enhancer mounted with a gap in the vacuum chamber
              practically on the same geometric axis of which at least
              the cathode is connected to a pulse high-voltage power
              source, according to the invention </p>
            <p>[0099] the plasma cathode is made in the form of a
              current-conducting rod comprising a dielectric end element
              having the perimeter of the rear end embracing the
              perimeter of said rod at least in the plane perpendicular
              to the axis of symmetry of the cathode with a continuous
              gap, and the area of the emitting surface being greater
              than the maximum cross-section area of the anode-enhancer,
            </p>
            <p>[0100] at least one of the electrodes is provided with a
              means for adjusting the gap between the electrodes, and </p>
            <p>[0101] the distance from the common geometric axis of
              said plasma cathode and anode-enhancer to the inner side
              of the current-conducting wall of the vacuum chamber is
              greater than 50d.sub.max, where d.sub.max is a maximum
              cross-sectional dimension of the anode-enhancer. </p>
            <p>[0102] The RVD having the combination of the mentioned
              features is useful at least for transmutation of nuclei of
              certain chemical elements into nuclei of other chemical
              elements as it was disclosed above in the commentaries to
              the subject matter of the method according to the
              invention. </p>
            <p>[0103] The first additional feature consists in that the
              current-conducting rod of the plasma cathode is pointed
              and the dielectric end element is provided with an opening
              for setting on said rod the setting part of which is
              located together with the pointed end inside the said
              opening. Such design makes it possible to stabilize the
              plasma cathode operation and at least partially to adjust
              the gap between the electrodes in the RVD by shifting the
              dielectric end element with respect to the
              current-conducting rod. </p>
            <p>[0104] The second additional feature consists in that the
              anode-enhancer has a circular shape in the cross section
              and is completely produced from a current-conducting in
              its main mass material to be transmuted. This allows to
              demonstrate the effect of transmutation on the simplest
              specimens of pure metals and metal alloys and to product
              transuranides in particular. </p>
            <p>[0105] The third additional feature consists in that the
              anode-enhancer is made composite and comprises at least a
              one-layer solid shell and an inserted target tightly
              embraced by this shell, said target being in the shape of
              a body of revolution and made of an arbitrary condensed
              material with a diameter in the range of
              (0.05-0.2).multidot.d.sub.max, where d.sub.max is a
              maximum cross-sectional dimension of the anode-enhancer.
              This allows to carry out the impact compression of a
              substance not only with the purpose of transmutation of
              atomic nuclei but also with the purpose of producing
              energy in the volume where pycnonuclear processes proceed
              with substantial (at least by an order) overshooting the
              Lawson criterion. </p>
            <p>[0106] The fourth additional feature consists in that at
              least one shield preferably of current-conducting material
              is mounted in the tail part of the anode-enhancer. It can
              capture a portion of products of pycnonuclear processes
              produced as a result of the impact compression of the main
              target to a superdense state and function as an additional
              target for nuclear interaction at the scattering of
              transmuted particles of the anode-enhancer. </p>
            <p>[0107] The fifth additional feature consists in that said
              shield is a thin-wall body of revolution with the diameter
              not less than 5d.sub.max which is spaced from the nearest
              to the plasma cathode end of said anode-enhancer by the
              distance up to 20d.sub.max, where d.sub.max is a maximum
              cross-sectional dimension of the anode-enhancer. Such
              shield promotes self-focussing of the electron beam on the
              major portion of the anode-enhancer surface and captures a
              tangible portion of products of pycnonuclear processes. </p>
            <p>[0108] The sixth additional feature consists in that said
              thin-wall body of revolution has a flat or concave surface
              at the side of the anode-enhancer. This significantly
              retards precipitation of the pycnonuclear processes
              products on the vacuum chamber walls. </p>
            <p>[0109] The third auxiliary aspect of the problem is
              solved in that in the axisymmetric plasma cathode having a
              current-conductive rod for connection to a pulsed
              high-voltage power source and a dielectric end element
              according to the invention the perimeter of the rear end
              of the dielectric element embraces the perimeter of said
              rod with a continuous gap at least in the plane
              perpendicular to the axis of symmetry of the cathode. </p>
            <p>[0110] In case of a breakdown along the surface, the
              dielectric end element of such cathode is practically
              instantly covers with plasma. The electron work function
              in such plasma is close to zero. Therefore, the current in
              the RVD electrode intermediate gap and, respectively, the
              total electron energy in the electron beam practically
              coincide with physically permissible maximum values of
              these parameters. That is why the plasma cathode of the
              invention is especially useful in RVD based devices for
              impact compression of a substance. </p>
            <p>[0111] The first additional feature consists in that the
              current-conducting rod of the plasma cathode is pointed
              and the dielectric end element is provided with an opening
              for setting on said rod the setting part of which is
              located together with the pointed end inside the said
              opening. As mentioned above, this makes it possible to use
              the plasma cathode at least as one of means for adjusting
              the gap between the RVD electrodes. </p>
            <p>[0112] The second additional feature consists in that the
              dielectric end element has a blind opening, which is more
              preferable in adjusting the gap between the RVD
              electrodes. </p>
            <p>[0113] The third additional feature consists in that the
              dielectric end element has a through opening, that is more
              preferable for controlling the formation of a plasma cloud
              and, respectively, stabilizing of the RVD operation at the
              moment of breakdown. </p>
            <p>[0114] The fourth additional feature consists in that the
              dielectric end element is made of a material selected from
              the group consisting of carbon-chain polymers with single
              carbon-to-carbon bonds, paper-base laminate or textolite
              type composite materials with organic binders, ebony wood,
              natural or synthetic mica, pure oxides of metals belonging
              to III-VII groups of the periodic table, inorganic glass,
              sitall, ceramic dielectrics and basalt-fiber felt. </p>
            <p>[0115] This list of preferable materials allows selection
              of dielectrics taking into account various requirements.
              For example, said organic materials and basalt-fiber felt
              are useful in terms of convenience in producing dielectric
              end elements and handling them while adjusting the gap
              between the RVD electrodes, and the rest of the mentioned
              inorganic materials are useful in terms of wear resistance
              and minimum effect upon the residual pressure in the RVD
              vacuum chamber after each next `shot`. </p>
            <p>[0116] The fifth additional feature consists in that the
              dielectric end element has a developed surface to
              facilitate formation of a plasma cloud in case of a
              breakdown. </p>
            <p>[0117] The sixth additional feature consists in that the
              minimum cross-sectional dimension of said dielectric
              element is C.sub.de min=(5-10).multidot.C.sub.cr max, and
              the length of said element is
              I.sub.de=(10-20).multidot.C.sub.cr max, where C.sub.cr max
              is a maximum cross-sectional dimension of the
              current-conducting rod. Such relative dimensions of parts
              of the plasma cathode completely exclude the pinch in the
              RVD electrode intermediate gap and ensure the electron
              beam self-focussing on a substantial part of the
              anode-enhancer. </p>
            <p>[0118] It will be understood that: </p>
            <p>[0119] In selection of specific embodiments of the
              invention, arbitrary combinations of said additional
              features with the primary inventive concept are possible,
            </p>
            <p>[0120] This inventive concept can be supplemented and/or
              specified within the scope defined by the claims using
              general knowledge of those skilled in the art, </p>
            <p>[0121] The preferable embodiments of the invention
              disclosed below are in no way intended to limit the scope
              of the invention. </p>

            <p>BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION </p>
            <p>[0140] The device according to the invention (FIG. 1) is
              made on the basis of a RVD. The essential parts thereof
              are: </p>
            <p>[0141] a strong gas-tight housing 1 which is made partly
              from a current-conducting material (for example, copper or
              stainless steel) shaped axisymmetrically to confine a
              vacuum chamber closed, in the operation condition, with a
              dielectric end cover 2 and connected when required via at
              least one pipe (not shown) to a vacuum pump; </p>
            <p>[0142] a non-consumable axisymmetric current-conducting
              rod 3 preferably circular in the cross section and
              preferably tapered in the longitudinal section, rigidly
              and tightly fixed in the cover 2 and intended for
              connection of RVD to a pulsed high-voltage power source
              described below; </p>
            <p>[0143] a replaceable (as worn out) axisymmetric plasma
              cathode comprising: </p>
            <p>[0144] a current-conducting rod 4 having its tail fixed
              in the rod 3 and </p>
            <p>[0145] a dielectric end element 5 rigidly connected with
              the rod 4, said element 5 having the area of the working
              end exceeding the cross-section area of the rod 4; </p>
            <p>[0146] an axisymmetric anode-enhancer 6 which can be
              either integral or including a target 7, the maximum
              cross-section area of said anode-enhancer being smaller
              than the area of the emitting surface of the dielectric
              end element 5; </p>
            <p>[0147] optionally, a shield 8 preferably of
              current-conducting material is mounted on the tail part of
              the anode-enhancer 6; </p>
            <p>[0148] at least one (not shown specially but denoted with
              pairs of arrows under the contours of the plasma cathode
              4, 5 and the anode-enhancer 6) mean for adjusting a gap
              between the electrodes, i. e. the space between the point
              of intersection of the end surface of the dielectric
              element 5 of the plasma cathode with its symmetry axis and
              similar point at the end of the anode-enhancer 6 both
              lying practically along the same geometric axis. </p>
            <p>[0149] The RVD pulsed high-voltage power source (FIG. 2)
              in the simplest case can be a well known to those skilled
              in the art system that includes at least one capacitive or
              inductive energy storage with at least two plasma (or
              other) current interrupters. However, preferable are
              `hybrid` sources of power (see, e.g., 1. P. F. Ottinger,
              J. Appl. Phys., 56, No. 3, 1984; 2. G. I. Dolgachev et al.
              Physics of Plasma, 24, No. 12, p. 1078, 1984) which
              comprise connected in series (FIG. 2): </p>
            <p>[0150] an input transformer 9 with means for connection
              to an industrial power network and a high-voltage output
              winding, </p>
            <p>[0151] a storage LC-circuit 10 comprising suitable (not
              shown) capacitors and inductors, </p>
            <p>[0152] a unit 11 for plasma interruption of discharge
              current in the LC-circuit comprising a set of well known
              to workers in the art plasma guns symmetrically located in
              one plane, the number of which (up to 12, in particular)
              usually being equal to the number of capacitors in the
              LC-circuit. </p>
            <p>[0153] Of course, besides of said power units, the RVD
              pulsed high-voltage power sources usually incorporate
              means (not shown) for measuring pulse current and voltage,
              such as at least one Rogovski belt and at least one
              capacitive voltage divider. </p>
            <p>[0154] A source of such type was used for the RVD supply
              in experiments on compressing a substance by impact to a
              superdense state described below. This source could
              provide the following values of the controlled parameters:
            </p>
            <p>[0155] Mean energy of beam electrons . . . 0.2 to 1.6 MeV
            </p>
            <p>[0156] Electron beam duration . . . not greater 100 ns </p>
            <p>[0157] Electron beam power . . . 2.10.sup.9 to
              0.75-10.sup.12 W </p>
            <p>[0158] High-voltage discharge current . . . 10 kA to 500
              kA. </p>
            <p>[0159] For effective carrying out of the method of impact
              compression of a substance, it is recommended to follow a
              number of additional conditions when producing individual
              parts of the RVD and targets. </p>
            <p>[0160] Thus, it is important that the distance from the
              common geometric axis of the plasma cathode 4, 5 and
              anode-enhancer 6 to the inner side of the
              current-conducting wall of the housing 1 exceed
              50d.sub.max, where d.sub.max is a maximum cross-sectional
              dimension of the anode-enhancer 6. </p>
            <p>[0161] It is desirable that the plasma cathode (FIG. 3)
              has its current-conducting rod 4 pointed and dielectric
              end element 5 provided with a blind or through opening.
              This element 5 must be fitted on the rod 4 with a slight
              tightness so that the setting part of the rod 4 together
              with the pointed end be found inside said opening. The
              shape of such opening in its cross-section and the
              cross-section of the rod 4 (provided the conditions of
              axial symmetry be followed) may be not circular (e.g.,
              oval, elliptic, star-like, as shown in FIG. 4, etc.). </p>
            <p>[0162] It is also desirable that the perimeter of the
              rear end of the dielectric element 5 (FIG. 4) at least in
              the plane perpendicular to the symmetry axis of the plasma
              cathode embrace the perimeter of the current-conducting
              rod 4 with a continuous gap. It is to be understood that
              this condition can be provided in various shapes of
              cross-sectional outline of the rod 4 and element 5. </p>
            <p>[0163] It is highly preferable that the dielectric end
              element 5 of the plasma cathode have a developed outer
              surface, e.g., initially rough, as shown in FIG. 4, or
              deliberately corrugated at least in one arbitrary
              direction. Particularly, element 5 can be used having a
              shape of an axisymmetric multiple-pointed star in their
              cross-sections. </p>
            <p>[0164] It is desirable that the minimum cross-sectional
              dimension C.sub.de min of said element 5 be in the range
              of (5-10).multidot.c.sub.cr max, and the length I.sub.de
              be in the range of (10-20).multidot.c.sub.cr max, where
              c.sub.cr max is a maximum cross-sectional dimension of the
              current-conducting rod 4. </p>
            <p>[0165] Said element 5 of the plasma cathode can be made
              of any dielectric material, which (at the chosen shape and
              dimensions) is capable for a breakdown under the chosen
              working voltage in the gap between the RVD electrodes. </p>
            <p>[0166] It is preferable that such material be selected
              from the group consisting of carbon-chain polymers with
              single carbon-to-carbon bonds (e.g., polyethylene,
              polypropylene etc.), paper-base laminate or textolite type
              composite materials with organic binders, ebony wood,
              natural or synthetic mica, pure oxides of metals belonging
              to III-VII groups of the periodic table, inorganic glass,
              sitall, basalt-fiber felt and ceramic dielectrics. </p>
            <p>[0167] As it was mentioned above, the axisymmetric
              anode-enhancer 6 can be: </p>
            <p>[0168] either integral (FIG. 5) and consisting of an
              arbitrary solid usually current-conducting in its mass
              preferably metallic material (including both pure metals
              and their alloys), e.g., copper, tantalum, lead, etc.; </p>
            <p>[0169] or have (FIG. 6) at least a one-layer preferably
              spherical shell 6 made of preferably current-conducting
              material and an axisymmetric inserted target 7 tightly
              fixed in said shell and made of an arbitrary condensed
              (solid or liquid) substance to be compressed by impact. </p>
            <p>[0170] A maximum diameter of the axisymmetric inserted
              target 7 is preferably selected in the range of
              (0.05-0.2).multidot.d.sub.max, where d.sub.max is a
              maximum cross-sectional dimension of the anode-enhancer 6
              as a whole. Irrespective of the geometric shape of the
              target 7 body, it must be fixed inside the anode-enhancer
              6 so that the center of its surface curvature practically
              coincide with the curvature center of the working surface
              of the anode enhancer 6. It is very important that
              dislocation density in the material of the anode-enhancer
              6 and in the material of the target 7 be as small as
              possible and that an acoustic contact be provided between
              these parts. </p>
            <p>[0171] Said shield 8, which can be mounted in the tail
              part of the anode-enhancer 6, is usually made from a
              current-conducting material as a preferably thin-wall body
              of revolution. The diameter of said shield 8 must be not
              smaller than 5d.sub.max and it's distance from the working
              end of the anode-enhancer 6 must be not greater than
              20d.sub.max, where d.sub.max is a maximum cross-sectional
              dimension of the anode-enhancer 6. It is desirable that
              said shield 8 have a flat or concave surface at the side
              of the working end of the anode-enhancer 6 (FIGS. 5 and
              6). </p>
            <p>[0172] The method for impact compression a substance
              using the described device usually includes: </p>
            <p>[0173] a) connecting the current-conducting rod 4 of the
              aforesaid plasma cathode to the non-consumable
              current-conducting rod 3; </p>
            <p>[0174] b) producing a set of replaceable axisymmetric
              anodes-enhancers 6 preferably having their working ends
              rounded in one of the following variants: </p>
            <p>[0175] either in the form of integral pieces of the
              material to be compressed by impact (for transmutation or
              any other nuclear transformation), </p>
            <p>[0176] or in the form of preferably one-layer shells
              wherein targets 7 are tightly inserted, said targets being
              made of the material (preliminarily encapsulated, as
              required) to be compressed by impact (for transmutation or
              any other nuclear transformation); </p>
            <p>[0177] c) (optionally) fitting at least some of the
              anodes-enhancers 6 with current-conducting shields 8 made
              of copper, lead, niobium, tantalum etc.; </p>
            <p>[0178] d) placing each next anode-enhancer 6 in the
              vacuum chamber of the RVD housing 1 practically on the
              same geometric axis with the plasma cathode 4, 5; </p>
            <p>[0179] e) adjusting the gap between the working ends of
              the dielectric end element 5 of the plasma cathode and the
              anode-enhancer 6 in such a way that the center of
              curvature of the working surface of the anode-enhancer 6
              is located inside the focal space of the collectively
              self-focussing electron beam at a pulse discharge of the
              power source via the RVD; </p>
            <p>[0180] f) closing the vacuum chamber by fitting the end
              dielectric cover 2 on a flange of the strong gas-tight
              current-conducting housing 1 of the RVD; </p>
            <p>[0181] g) vacuuming the chamber in the RVD housing 1,
              which is carried out: </p>
            <p>[0182] at least twice prior to the first `shot` upon the
              target (pumping out the air first and then at least once
              blowing down the chamber with clean dry nitrogen and
              re-vacuuming to the residual pressure of gases not greater
              than 0.1 Pa), and </p>
            <p>[0183] at least once prior to each next `shot`, if the
              residual pressure exceeds said value; </p>
            <p>[0184] h) connecting an external high-voltage power
              source of the RVD to a power network via the input
              transformer 9 and storing the electric energy required for
              an experiment in the LC-circuit 10; </p>
            <p>[0185] i) discharging the LC-circuit 10 via the unit 11
              for plasma interruption of the current pulse, the
              non-consumable axisymmetric current-conducting rod 3, the
              replaceable current-conducting rod 4 and the dielectric
              end element 5 on the RVD anode-enhancer 6 with generation
              of an electron beam having the electron energy not less
              than 0.2 MeV, current density not less than 10.sup.6
              A/cm.sup.2 (and preferably not more than 10.sup.8
              A/cm.sup.2, and more preferably not more than 10.sup.7
              A/cm.sup.2) and duration not greater than 100 ns (and
              preferably not more than 50 ns); </p>
            <p>[0186] j) removing of the products obtained after the
              compression of a portion of the target substance to a
              superdense state from the vacuum chamber of the RVD
              housing 1 and studying these products by the commonly used
              techniques. </p>
            <p>[0187] The experimental targets were intended to: </p>
            <p>[0188] demonstrate the transmutation effect as a result
              of the impact compression of a substance to a superdense
              state (integral anodes-enhancers 6 in accordance with FIG.
              5); and </p>
            <p>[0189] evaluate the possibility of radioactive materials
              deactivation (hollow-body anode-enhancers 6 with inserted
              target 7 according to FIGS. 1 and 6). As mentioned above,
              such target 7 must be inserted into the anode-enhancer 6
              providing the maximum acoustic transparency of their
              junction contact, and the curvature centers of the working
              surfaces of the both said components must coincide
              practically. </p>
            <p>[0190] The integral anodes-enhancers 6 had average radius
              of curvature of the working ends in the range of 0.2 to
              0.5 mm, as a rule. They were made, particularly, of
              chemically pure metals, such as copper, tantalum and lead.
              Such anodes-enhancers 6 can be stored outdoors. An oxide
              film that appears on the surface (especially of copper and
              lead) does not prevent and, according to some
              observations, even enhances their use in accordance with
              the above-mentioned purposes. </p>
            <p>[0191] The inserted targets 7 had a shape of pellets made
              of available Co.sup.60 isotope and artificial mixtures of
              Co.sup.56 and Co.sup.58 produced by irradiation of natural
              nickel on U-120 cyclotron in Nuclear Research Institute of
              National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine. </p>
            <p>[0192] The use of such targets required additional shells
              (not shown) made of polycaprolactam (capron) that are
              mounted inside the RVD vacuum chambers. These shells
              enveloped both RVD electrodes and reduced significantly
              the risk of the radioactive cobalt precipitation on the
              walls of the housing 1 and the RVD cover 2. </p>
            <p>[0193] The initial radioactivity values and those
              attained after transmutation of utilized cobalt isotopes
              were controlled by ordinary germanium-lithium gamma-ray
              detectors. </p>
            <p>[0194] More than thousand of adjustment experiments had
              been carried out prior to beginning of the operational
              experiments on impact compression of a substance to a
              superdense state. The results of adjustment experiments
              helped to select and more exactly define (taken into
              account the dimensions of parts 4,5 of the plasma cathode
              and anode-enhancer 6, and specific parameters of the
              charge) the width of the gap between the RVD electrodes in
              order to provide hitting of the target curvature centers
              into the focal space of the RVD electron beam. </p>
            <p>[0195] The operational experiments were carried out in
              series. Their number varied in different series and ranged
              from 50 (at transmutation of radioactive cobalt) to
              several hundreds. All the experiments had a through
              numbering. </p>
            <p>[0196] The initial data on the used targets, discharge
              parameters and obtained results were recorded in logbooks
              under sequential numbers. </p>
            <p>[0197] The shape of voltage and current pulses in the gap
              between the RVD electrodes and actual duration of the
              electron beam were checked with current and voltage
              oscillograms, typical examples are shown in FIG. 7. These
              and many other oscillograms demonstrate that the duration
              of the electron beam does not exceed 100 ns. </p>
            <p>[0198] It is important to note that the electron beam
              current (despite a sharp voltage drop on the RVD plasma
              cathode) only slightly decreases as compared to the peak
              value. This proves the efficiency of usage of the plasma
              cathodes 4,5. </p>
            <p>[0199] After statistical processing of the results of the
              adjustment experiments with regard to the controlled
              parameters of the electron beam generation process
              approximate dimensions for the electrodes gap and
              approximate values of the focal space volume were
              determined (see Table 1). </p>

            <p>[0200] Following these limits of the gap between the RVD
              electrodes in the operational experiments ensured: </p>
            <p>[0201] First, hit of the curvature centers of the working
              surfaces of the integral anodes-enhancers 6 (and in case
              of using targets 7, hit of the curvature centers of their
              surfaces too) into the focal space of the collectively
              self-focussing electron beam and </p>
            <p>[0202] Second, reveal of the effect of transmutation
              after each pulsed discharge of the RVD power source. </p>
            <p>[0203] Moreover, following the parameters listed in Table
              1, the current density on the surface of the working end
              of the anode-enhancer 6 was possible to establish within
              the range of 10.sup.6 A/cm.sup.2 to 10.sup.8 A/cm.sup.2.
              For the most part of impact compression experiments, this
              parameter was maintained within the range of 10.sup.6
              A/cm.sup.2 to 10.sup.7 A/cm.sup.2. </p>
            <p>[0204] The results of all the operational experiments
              looked rather uniform, namely: </p>
            <p>[0205] Products of transmutation in the form of a wide
              spectrum of practically stable isotopes of various (both
              light and heavy, and even super-heavy transuranides)
              chemical elements appeared from a portion (at the average
              about 30% by weight) of the initial material; </p>
            <p>[0206] These products and chemically unchanged residues
              of integral anodes-enhancers 6 (and inserted targets 7)
              flew apart from the volume of impact compression primarily
              in the direction opposite to the plasma cathode and
              precipitated as drop-shaped aggregates of various forms
              and dimensions on the walls of the vacuum chamber of the
              RVD and/or on the shields 8, if applicable. </p>
            <p>[0207] Said products were collected for study. </p>
            <p>[0208] Electron microprobe-analyzers REMMA-102, Tesla and
              Cameca were used for detecting of separated aggregates of
              transmutation products and determination of their position
              on the surface (on shields 8 in particular) with the
              purpose of subsequent study of the elemental and isotopic
              composition (and in certain cases, for registration of the
              shape of such aggregates). Jamp10S model of an Auger
              spectrometer by JEOL, time-of-flight pulsed laser
              mass-spectrometer designed by Kiev's National T. G.
              Shevchenko University (Ukraine), ionic microprobe-analyzer
              CAMECA's IMS-4f and FINNIGAN's highly sensitive
              mass-spectrometer VG9000 were used for the study of the
              elemental and isotopic composition of said products. </p>
            <p>[0209] As a result in all the operational experiments on
              impact compression of integral anodes-enhancers 6 to a
              superdense state, an essential discrepancy was observed
              between their initial composition (practically one
              chemical element for all targets in each series) and
              elemental and isotopic composition of the transmutation
              products. </p>
            <p>[0210] In order to make certain of that, let's observe
              FIGS. 8 to 13 wherein vertical dash lines indicate the
              charge of an initial chemical element's nucleus. </p>
            <p>[0211] It should be noted, that the isotopes of chemical
              elements which were not present in the initial material of
              the target but appeared in the products of transmutation
              are indicated in FIGS. 8, 10 and 12: </p>
            <p>[0212] by light circles according to their concentration
              in said products of pycnonuclear processes, </p>
            <p>[0213] by black squares according to their concentration
              in the Earth's crust. </p>
            <p>[0214] Nuclei charges and percentage by weight of these
              isotopes are easy to determine using the numerical data on
              the X and Y axis respectively. </p>
            <p>[0215] With light triangles and adjacent chemical
              symbols, FIGS. 9, 11 and 13 show relative deviations Y of
              concentrations (% by weight) of certain chemical elements
              from natural abundance ratio that were calculated by
              formula: 1 A - B A + B = Y , where : </p>
            <p>[0216] A is a ratio of a certain isotope of a certain
              chemical element in the products of transmutation, and </p>
            <p>[0217] B is a ratio of the same isotope of the same
              chemical element in the Earth's crust. </p>
            <p>[0218] As it's clearly seen from FIGS. 8, 10 and 12, in
              the process of transmutation of initial copper, tantalum
              and lead appears a wide spectrum of isotopes of various
              chemical elements with smaller and greater Z nuclear
              charges in comparison to the nuclear charge of parent
              element. </p>
            <p>[0219] However, the greater is the nuclear charge of the
              target material the higher is the probability of
              production of stable transuranides (including those not
              identified yet) with atomic mass of greater than 250
              atomic mass units (and in some to be checked cases, up to
              600 amu and greater). </p>
            <p>[0220] The presence of atoms having such masses was
              detected at first by the method of ion mass spectrometry
              and then was proved by well known methods of Rutherford
              alpha and proton back-scattering. </p>
            <p>[0221] Moreover, FIGS. 9, 11 and 13 clearly show that
              concentrations of substantial portion of chemical elements
              in transmutation products statistically reliably exceed
              (more than in three times and some elements in 5-10 and
              more times) their normal concentrations in the Earth's
              crust (see areas marked out with dark colour within the
              range of Y values from 0.5 to 1.0). This obviously proves
              the artificial origin of such products of pycnonuclear
              processes. </p>
            <p>[0222] As for changes in elemental and isotopic
              composition, similar results were obtained also in
              experiments with targets of radioactive cobalt. However,
              in these cases the main attention was paid to reduction in
              radioactivity in products of the target spread due to
              transmutation of radioactive nuclei of cobalt into
              non-radioactive isotopes of other chemical elements, in
              those part of the target which was in the focal space. </p>
            <p>[0223] This reduction essentially varied in separate
              samples, that can be explained by difference in density of
              acoustic contact between the inner walls of cavities in
              anodes-enhancers and the material of inserted targets 7
              (see data from a log-book in Table 2). </p>
            <p>2TABLE 2 Radioactivity reduction in the products of
              cobalt targets spread Reduction in Reduction in Reduction

            <p>[0224] Thus, sample No. 2479 was deactivated only by 2.2%
              whereas sample No. 2397 and No. 2588 lost more than 45% of
              their activity in the result of transmutation. </p>
            <p>[0225] Further, as it was definitely established, the
              distribution of isotopes in conglomerates of atoms of each
              chemical element detected in products of pycnonuclear
              processes is essentially differed from the distribution of
              the same isotopes in the Earth's crust. </p>
            <p>[0226] The brightest example of such drastic discrepancy
              is the difference between the normal distribution of
              isotopes of nickel in natural samples (FIG. 14) and in two
              aggregates of nickel atoms produced by transmutation of
              copper targets (FIGS. 15 and 16). Thus, the content of
              Ni.sup.58 isotope is up to 70% in the mass of natural
              nickel, while the proportion of Ni.sup.58 in products of
              copper transmutation (with Cu.sup.63 isotope dominating in
              the target) exceeds 10%. Similarly, content of Ni.sup.60
              isotope essentially (usually twice) decreased whereas
              content of Ni.sup.62 sharply increased. </p>
            <p>[0227] And at last, a bright evidence of impact
              compression of a substance to a superdense state by the
              method according to the invention is an ejection from the
              RVD focal space rather big bodies whose shape visually
              proves the existence of necessary conditions for a
              short-term appearance of at least electron-nuclear and,
              even, electron-nucleonic plasma in said space. </p>
            <p>[0228] Thus, on FIG. 17, presented essentially iron
              hemisphere comprising 93% by weight Fe with admixtures of
              silicon and copper isotopes on the background of the
              copper shield. </p>
            <p>[0229] Obviously, this hemisphere is a fraction of a
              spherical body formed from a substantial part of the
              copper anode-enhancer 6 (sample No. 4908 according to the
              log-book of the applicant). It has an outer diameter about
              95 .mu.m and a practically concentric spherical cavity
              with a diameter of about 35 .mu.m. The roughness on the
              major portion of the ring end of the hemisphere can be
              explained by the crack of the initial sphere. </p>
            <p>[0230] It is easy to assume that in the experiment with
              the sample No. 4908, the center of the focal space of the
              electron beam practically coincided with the center of the
              target curvature. In this case, soliton-like density
              impulse focussed itself in the volume that is represented
              as a spherical cavity in the disclosed product. </p>
            <p>INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY </p>

            <p>Abstract&nbsp; --- A static breakdown induced by the
              impact of particles detached from a point anode in a
              strong electric field, corresponding to the athermal field
              evaporation threshold, was studied by field ion
              microscopy. Under these conditions, the particle size
              threshold for the vacuum discharge initiation decreases by
              one order of magnitude as compared to the case of flat
              electrodes and falls within a nanometer range of the
              average radius of bombarding charged particles. The
              threshold energies of particles initiating a static
              electric discharge also exhibit a significant decrease. </p>

            <p>Abstract ---&nbsp; We consider the peculiarities of the
              fundamental nuclear transformations running both in the
              shell of a heavy star compressed by the strong
              gravitational field and during the laboratory
              electron-nucleus collapse where the compression occurs at
              the expense of the electron-nucleus interaction in a
              volume occupied by a degenerate electron gas, define their
              analogs, and analyze the differences. </p>
            <p>It is shown that the account of relativistic and
              nonlinear corrections to the Coulomb electron-nucleus
              interaction gives the possibility to realize two
              alternative ways for the evolution of the star matter
              which depend on both the rate of compression upon the
              gravitational collapse and the initial isotope composition
              of a star on the stage preceding the collapse. </p>
            <p>Upon the relatively slow compression of a heavy star in
              the process of gravitational collapse after the attainment
              of the threshold electron density, there occur the
              stage-by-stage neutronization of nuclei and the formation
              of a neutron star with a great concentration of neutrons
              and a low concentration of protons and electrons. This
              process is characterized by the presence of a bounded
              interval of the density of a relativistic degenerate gas
              of electrons (the neutronization corridor), in the scope
              of which the neutronization runs with a decrease in the
              Fermi energy and the release of energy in the form of fast
              neutrinos. </p>
            <p>At a higher electron density, the process of
              protonization becomes energy-gained. In this case, an
              increase in both the charge of nuclei and the
              concentration of degenerate electrons causes the
              continuous increase in the binding energy of electrons and
              nuclei which turns out to be more significant than the
              increase in the Fermi energy of electrons. The transition
              of nuclei through the neutronization corridor into the
              protonization zone, which ranges up to the nuclear
              density of a substance, is possible only in the case of a
              very fast compression of a heavy star. Such a process
              leads to the possibility of the formation of proton stars
              with a very small residual concentration of neutrons and a
              great (nuclear) concentration of protons and electrons. </p>
            <p>It is shown that analogous effects can be realized during
              the laboratory electron-nucleus collapse. Due to a
              microscopic size of the collapse zone, a great velocity of
              its formation, and a relatively low rate of
              neutronization, the passage of the electron-nucleus
              substance through the neutronization corridor weakly
              affects its state. In this case, the main mechanism of
              transformations is the process of protonization with a
              simultaneous increase in the concentration of degenerate
              electrons. </p>
