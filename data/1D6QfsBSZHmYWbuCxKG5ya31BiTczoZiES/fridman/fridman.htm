      <span style="font-style: italic;">Bunker-bust boom blaster offered
        for riot pacification</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
      <br>
      Israel intends to offer for export one of its latest and most
      terrifying military technologies: a sonic cannon or "thunder
      generator", powered by devasting "bunker buster" fuel-air
      explosive technology - used in secret Nazi superweapons of the
      1940s - to deliver sound rays so powerful as to be instantly
      deadly to anyone hearing them.<br>
      <br>
      Or, looking at it another way, Israeli businessmen have decided to
      market an LPG fuelled bird-scaring device as a "less-lethal" riot
      control weapon.<br>
      <br>
      Defense News reports from Tel Aviv on the Thunder Generator, which
      started life as a bird-scaring device intended to keep feathered
      intruders away from crops, airports and so forth. It uses bottled
      LPG to create an explosive fuel-air mixture inside a tubular
      combustion chamber ("cannon barrel"). The mix is then detonated,
      causing a loud explosion whose blast vents out of one end of the
      chamber.<br>
      <br>
      According to Defense News, this is "a patented process involving
      Pulse Detonation Technology (PDT)". There might be some new
      special sauce involved, but the basic idea is an old one -
      pulse-detonated fuel/air mixtures were used in the Argus "pulse
      jet" which propelled the Nazis' V-1 (aka "Doodlebug") cruise
      missiles during WWII, for instance.<br>
      <br>
      Fuel-air explosions can also be generated without a confining
      container, as in the various kinds of "bunker buster" munitions
      employed by the world's militaries - so called as their prolonged
      overpressure is particularly hard on structures. Russia's "Father
      of All Bombs" and the British shoulder-fired Anti Structures
      Munition are of this type.<br>
      <br>
      Igor Fridman, one-time Soviet scientist, decided to use the
      principle for bird-scaring after moving to Israel in 1991. The use
      of cheap, clean LPG was seen as a win compared to nasty chemical
      bird repellents.<br>
      <br>
      As it happens, fuel/air effects are used for similar purposes in
      America: the fearsome "Rodenator" burrow-busting weapon has lately
      been employed against troublesome tree-scoffing squirrels by
      uncompromising US parkies, for instance.<br>
      <br>
      But now it seems that Israel's booming (cough) weaponry industry
      has decided that riot-control devices are more profitable than
      birdscarer kit, and the Thunder Generator has now been licensed
      for export as a weapon. Fridman tells Defence News that it "could
      be lethal" inside 10 metres, but that if used as intended outside
      30 metres' range it should cause no permanent ill effects.<br>
      <br>
      Apparently, the frightful sonic shockwave raygun is "safe and
      simple to use", and "menial labourers" can be trained to handle it
      in less than 30 minutes.<br>

          Harnesses Shock Waves for Homeland Defense</b><br>

      <b><br>
      </b><b>By BARBARA OPALL-ROME</b><b><br>
      </b>&nbsp;<br>
      TEL AVIV - An Israeli-developed shock wave cannon used by farmers
      to scare away crop-threatening birds could soon be available to
      police and homeland security forces around the world for nonlethal
      crowd control and perimeter defense.<br>
      <br>
      Israel's Ministry of Defense recently approved a license for
      ArmyTec, a Netanya, Israel, technology development advisory firm,
      to market military and paramilitary versions of the Thunder
      Generator cannon.<br>
      <br>
      Developed and produced for the agricultural industry by PDT Agro,
      a small firm based in Herzliya, Israel, the system detonates a
      mixture of common liquefied petroleum (LPG), cooking gas and air
      to generate a series of loud, stunning shock waves.<br>
      <br>
      Using a patented process involving Pulse Detonation Technology
      (PDT), the system feeds the gas-air mixture into one or more
      so-called impulse chambers or cannon barrels, where the burning
      fuel detonates and intensifies in force as it travels through the
      chamber, exiting in a rapid-fire succession of high-velocity shock
      bursts.<br>
      <br>
      A small battery-powered control system - about twice the size of a
      pack of cigarettes - measures fuel pressure, temperature and flow
      rates while monitoring the continuous intake of the air-gas
      mixture.<br>
      <br>
      According to company data, the system generates 60 to 100 bursts
      per minute, each traveling at about 2,000 meters per second and
      lasting up to 300 milliseconds.<br>
      <br>
      The resulting shocks create a double deterrent to rioters and
      potential intruders, developers here say, by the extreme air
      pressure and sonic boom effect generated once the mixture
      propagates and expands through the air. One standard 12-kilogram
      LPG gas canister (retail cost: about $25) can produce up to 5,000
      shock bursts.<br>
      <br>
      "That's more than enough for hours of continuous operation," said
      ArmyTec President Shlomo Tabak, a former Israeli military special
      operations officer, whose command positions included anti-terror
      training and oversight of Special Forces development programs.<br>
      <br>
      "It's all done in a controlled and safe manner, using the
      cheapest, cleanest fuel available. The trick is to cause it not to
      burn, but to explode," said Igor Fridman, president of PDT Agro,
      who developed the system.<br>
      <br>
      Fridman, a former Soviet scientist specializing in the physics of
      combustion and detonation, worked for years at the Institute for
      Ecologically Safe Technologies in Novosibirsk, Russia. After
      immigrating to Israel in 1991, he teamed with Bezelel Liberman, an
      explosives expert and former officer in the Israeli military's
      Engineering Corps and the Israel Police, to adapt the pulse
      detonation technology for commercial and industrial use.<br>
      <br>
      With start-up funding from Israel's Chief Scientist's Office, the
      two established PDT Agro and began producing precursors of the
      Thunder Generator as an alternative to hazardous chemicals.<br>
      <br>
      "Because we can control the power of the shock waves, we found we
      can use the process for many applications, including military,
      police and peripheral security missions," Liberman said. "It's
      much safer, cheaper and in many cases [more] politically
      acceptable than other explosive materials."<br>
      <br>
      As for range, it all depends on the size of the cannon, Tabak
      said. The operational prototype demonstrated over the past six
      months to representatives of Israel's Ground Forces Command,
      Central Command and Israeli Police features a 5-inch barrel with a
      range of 30 to 50 meters.<br>
      <br>
      "But if we make some changes in the diameter, our data shows we'll
      go up to 70 to 100 meters, without any other changes to the
      system," Tabak said.<br>
      <br>
      If fired at less than 10 meters, the Thunder Generator could be
      lethal or inflict permanent damage, Fridman said. But when
      employed as intended at ranges of 30 meters or more, test data
      show that the shock waves will pass through people and objects
      without any lasting effects.<br>
      <br>
      "Anyone within 30 to 50 meters from the cannon will feel like he's
      standing in front of a firing squad," he said. "He'll feel and
      hear the blast, but he won't be hurled to the ground. He'll be
      able to run away unharmed … and that's the point of this
      application."<br>
      <br>
      Thunder Generator developers secured a U.S. patent on their system
      in mid-2009. In addition to its intended nonlethal effects on
      targets, they insist the system is safe and simple to use.<br>
      <br>
      Menial laborers at Israeli farms and fisheries have been trained
      in less than 30 minutes, Liberman said, to operate the cannon to
      scare away birds migrating between Europe and Africa. He said
      nearly a dozen systems have been operating accident-free in Israel
      for nearly two years.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Multiple Missions, Configurations</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Tabak said the Thunder Generator is adaptable for multiple
      missions, including defense of sensitive installations and
      hostage-rescue operations. Modular nozzles can control output,
      allowing shock waves to be calibrated and programmed to meet
      various tactical mission requirements, he said.<br>
      <br>
      In addition to the basic single-barrel, cart-mounted design,
      ArmyTec is offering Thunder Generator in fixed or vehicle-mounted
      installations, operated manually or via remote control. The firm's
      proposed multibarrel design simulates a battlefield-like
      experience, while a three-axis moving barrel allows precise
      targeting of areas within a wide perimeter. For very-wide-area
      coverage, the firm recommends synchronized networks of multiple
      cannons.<br>
      <br>
      By affixing bended barrels to the pulse detonation system, Thunder
      Generator also can shoot at 90-degree angles, delivering shock
      waves around walls or other obstacles, Tabak said.<br>
      <br>
      "We're talking about a working system. There are no technology
      gaps; it's all a matter of adapting the configuration to a
      specific operational concept," he said.<br>
      <br>
      A senior MoD development official said voluminous data on
      potential physiological side effects of nonlethal and so-called
      less-than-lethal systems must be gathered before turning them over
      to operational users. He said the Ministry of Defense puts a
      premium on systems proven to be safe, inexpensive and effective at
      ranges of less than 100 meters.<br>
      <br>
      Ephraim Sneh, a former Israeli defense minister, said more effort
      should be put into deploying such systems. "Use of nonlethal means
      saves lives and helps prevent violent deterioration of riots and
      mass protests," he said.<br>
      <br>
      Sneh said the Thunder Generator is a good example of a safe,
      inexpensive and simple alternative to the use of lethal force.<br>

        Abstract</span> -- A two-phase shock wave generator
      incorporating a combustion chamber (20) including a first
      combustion portion (25) having an input port and a second
      detonation portion (27) downstream of the first portion (25) and
      having an output aperture (34), an air-fuel supply line (15)
      operative to feed the input port with an air-fuel mixture, an
      igniter (16), associated with the air-fuel supply line (15) and a
      turbulence stimulator (22), mounted in the combustion chamber
      (20), which enhances and controls burning of the air-fuel. The
      turbulence stimulator (22) includes a first section (24) having a
      predetermined first gas dynamic resistance and a second section
      (27) having a predetermined second gas dynamic resistance. The
      first resistance is such that burning of the air-fuel mixture in
      the combustion portion yields a predetermined pressure level
      suitable for initiating detonation of the remaining air-fuel
      mixture in the detonation portion. The second resistance supports
      continued detonation of the remaining air-fuel mixture in the
      detonation portion. Preferably, the second gas dynamic resistance
      is lower than the first gas dynamic resistance.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The present invention relates to combustion and explosion
      processes in general, more particularly, to the use of combustion
      or explosion processes for industrial application, such as
      cleaning of industrial equipment and machinery by devices
      employing these processes.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Proper maintenance of industrial machinery generally includes
      frequent removal of undesired accumulations of particles on
      different elements of the machinery. Particles accumulation on the
      machinery parts can be minimalized by cleaning the environment
      surrounding the machinery. Various air cleaning devices have been
      used for that purpose.<br>
      <br>
      Although a clean working environment reduces particle accumulation
      on the machinery parts, it cannot prevent such accumulation
      completely. Thus, more direct methods for cleaning the machinery
      parts are often required.<br>
      <br>
      It is known that efficient cleaning of various machinery parts may
      be achieved by generating shock waves in the vicinity of the parts
      thereby "shaking off" dust particles and other accumulations from
      the parts. Alternatively, the shock waves may be induced onto a
      machinery part, causing the part to vibrate and "shake off" the
      accumulations. Shock wave cleaning is particularly useful for
      elements which are not readily removed for cleaning and/or
      elements which are particularly susceptible to the use of other
      cleaning methods and/or cleaning materials.<br>
      <br>
      Gas dynamic generators which induce shock wave vibrations in their
      vicinity are known in the art. When a gas dynamic generator is
      placed near a machinery element to be cleaned, the shock waves
      induced in the vicinity of the element can be utilized to clean
      the element, as described above. Gas dynamic generators are useful
      aids in the production of construction materials and apparatus,
      metallurgy, mining, the chemical industry, oil processing and the
      food industry.<br>
      <br>
      Gas dynamic generators have been used in the past, for example,
      for cleaning dust accumulation and other deposits in a centrifugal
      compressor. The centrifugal compressor includes a pumping wheel
      with pumping blades mounted in a pumping chamber. Nozzles, which
      are connected to a source of pressured gas via a gas channel, are
      mounted in the pumping chamber at a preselected distance from the
      pumping blades. The source generates high pressure gas pulses
      which impinge on the pumping blades thereby removing undesired
      accumulations from the blades. For optimal results, the distance
      between the nozzles and the pumping blades is selected to be
      between 1 and 1.5 times the diameter of the gas channel.<br>
      <br>
      Gas dynamic generators have also been used for cleaning
      contaminated electrodes, particularly for purifying electrodes of
      electrofilters. An ignited air-fuel mixture is transported through
      an elongated detonation chamber, in which the burning mixture
      develops a high velocity, and is released onto a shock receiving
      plate which is associated with a shock transporting block. The
      block carries shock waves produced in the plate to the electrodes,
      thereby causing high acceleration vibrations in the electrodes to
      "shake off" the deposits.<br>
      <br>
      Although existing gas dynamic pulse generators are useful for some
      applications, such as for cleaning compressor blades and removing
      deposits from electrodes, these systems generally suffer from high
      energy consumption and low operating efficiency. The output
      pressures obtained by devices as described above generally does
      not exceed 10-12 bars and, even then, most of the gas dynamic
      energy is not utilized since only a fraction of the pulsed gas
      dynamic energy is converted into shock waves in the part to be
      cleaned. Additionally, since the burning rate of the air-fuel
      mixture is relatively low (typically 400-500 meters per second)
      compared to the expansion rate of the mixture, only part of the
      mixture (typically non more than 30%) is utilized to produce the
      gas dynamic pulses. This difference between the burning rate and
      the expansion rate may also result in undesirable release of a
      flammable air-fuel mixture, thereby reducing the efficiency of the
      system and endangering the persons operating the system.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The present invention seeks to provide a more efficient and more
      powerful method and apparatus for generating gas dynamic pulses,
      e.g. shock waves. A shock wave generator constructed and operative
      in accordance with the present invention may be utilized to remove
      various deposits from industrial machinery parts, for example to
      clear clogged pipes or to ensure free flow of dry materials.<br>
      <br>
      In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention
      there is thus provided a two-phase shock wave generator including
      a combustion chamber including a first, combustion, portion having
      an input port and a second, detonation, portion downstream of the
      first portion and having an output aperture; an air-fuel supply
      line, operative to feed the input port with an air-fuel mixture,
      an igniter, associated with the air-fuel supply line, which
      ignites the air-fuel mixture in the supply line and initiates a
      burning front which propagates towards the input port and a
      turbulence stimulator, fixedly mounted in the combustion chamber,
      which enhances and controls burning of the air-fuel mixture and
      includes a first section, situated within the combustion portion
      of the combustion chamber and having a preselected first gas
      dynamic resistance and a second section, situated within the
      detonation portion of the combustion chamber and having a
      preselected second gas dynamic resistance, lower than the first
      resistance, wherein the first resistance is such that burning of
      the air-fuel mixture in the combustion portion yields a
      predetermined pressure level suitable for initiating detonation of
      the remaining air-fuel mixture, in the detonation portion, and
      wherein the second resistance supports continued detonation of the

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A
        PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Reference is now made to FIG. 1, which schematically illustrates a
      preferred embodiment of the gas dynamic pulse generator of the
      present invention. As shown in FIG. 1, the gas dynamic pulse
      generator preferably includes a fuel supply line 10, an air supply
      line 12, a mixer 14, an air-fuel mixture carrier line 15, an
      igniter 16 associated with a preselected portion of carrier line
      15, a perforated nozzle 18 mounted to the end of carrier line 15,
      a combustion chamber 20 and a two-phase turbulence stimulator 22
      mounted in combustion chamber 22.<br>
      <br>
      Fuel, preferably a combustible gas such as Methane (CH.sub.4), and
      air are compressed through lines 10 and 12, respectively, into
      mixer 14 at suitable pressures so as to provide, at the output of
      mixer 14, an air-fuel mixture having a preselected fuel to air
      ratio. Preferably, the fuel to air ratio provided by mixer 14 is
      higher than the ratio required for a normal chemical reaction
      between the fuel and the air. The air-fuel mixture is carried via
      carrier line 15 and released via perforated nozzle 18 into
      combustion chamber 20. Igniter 16, preferably a spark plug
      sealingly mounted into carrier line 15, is activated only after
      combustion chamber 20 has been filled with a predetermined amount
      of fuel-air mixture suitable for proper combustion.<br>
      <br>
      Activation of igniter 16 initiates burning of the air-fuel mixture
      in carrier line 15, creating a burning front which propagates
      towards perforated nozzle 18. When the burning front reaches
      perforated nozzle 18, the front is broken and a scattered flame
      front is released into combustion chamber 20. Scattering of the
      burning front by nozzle 18 is preferred because it provides a
      considerably larger area of contact between the propagating
      burning front and the air-fuel mixture in combustion chamber 20.
      It should be appreciated that the increased contact area between
      the burning front and the air-fuel mixture provides more rapid
      combustion of the air-fuel mixture in combustion chamber 20. This
      initiates a first phase of the burning process, hereinafter
      referred to as the combustion phase.<br>
      <br>
      Within combustion chamber 20, the burning front confronts
      two-phase turbulence stimulator 22 which enhances and expedites
      combustion of the air-fuel mixture in a controlled manner, as will
      now be described.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 2 pictorially illustrates turbulence stimulator 22 in greater
      detail. As shown in FIG. 2, turbulence stimulator 22 is preferably
      composed of a longitudinal axis 23 and a plurality of radially
      extending rods 28 which are generally perpendicular to a
      longitudinal axis 23, i.e. generally perpendicular to the
      propagation direction of the burning front. In accordance with a
      preferred embodiment of the present invention, turbulence
      stimulator 22 includes a first section 24, associated with a
      first, combustion, portion 25 of combustion chamber 20, and a
      second section 26, associated with a second, detonation, portion
      27 of combustion chamber 20. The spaces between neighboring rods
      28 in first section 24 are preferably smaller than the spaces
      between neighboring rods 28 in second section 26. Additionally or
      alternatively, rods 28 in section 24 may be thicker than rods 28
      in detonation section 26.<br>
      <br>
      In a preferred embodiment of the invention, rods 28 of sections 24
      and 26 of stimulator 22 are arranged in equiplanar groups,
      hereinafter referred to as obstructers 30 and 32, respectively.
      The number of rods in each obstructer may vary but, preferably,
      each obstructer 30 includes more rods 28 than each obstructer 32.
      For example, each of obstructers 30 may include four rods 28,
      arranged in the form of a cross, and each of obstructers 32 may
      include two radially aligned rods 28. The rods of successive
      obstructers, 30 or 32, are preferably angularly shifted such that
      the outward ends of rods 28 define a helical path having a
      preselected pitch. The pitch of the helical path defined by the
      ends of rods 28 is preferably selected, empirically, so as to
      produce optimal turbulence of the burning air-fuel mixture in
      combustion chamber 20.<br>
      <br>
      In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the radially
      outward ends of rods 28 do not touch the internal surface of
      combustion chamber 20. Preferably, there is a preselected
      distance, typically at least 2-3 millimeters, between the ends of
      rods 28 and the internal surface of chamber 20. This provides
      improved, turbulated, flow of the burning air-fuel mixture in
      combustion chamber 20.<br>
      <br>
      Rods 28, which preferably have a diameter of between 10 and 14
      millimeters, are operative to impose a predetermined resistance on
      the propagating burning gasses in combustion chamber 20 and,
      thereby, to control the gas pressure in combustion chamber 20
      during the burning process. In a preferred embodiment of the
      invention, obstructers 30 and 32 are positioned along axis 23 with
      appropriate spacing so as to yield a desired burning sequence of
      the air-fuel mixture in combustion chamber 20, as described below.<br>
      <br>
      Due to the generally thicker rods 28 in first section 24 and/or
      the greater number of rods 28 in each obstructer 30 and/or the
      closer spacing between successive obstructers 30 in first section
      24, the resistance imposed by section 24 on gasses flowing
      therealong is generally greater than the resistance imposed on
      gasses flowing along second section 26. This results in a rapid
      build up of pressure as long as the burning front interacts with
      first section 24, reaching a peak suitable for detonation of the
      air-fuel mixture substantially when the burning front reaches the
      interface between section 24 and section 26. According to the
      present invention, the peak pressure reached by the burning front,
      at the interface between sections 24 and 26, is sufficient for
      initiating detonation of the remaining, unburnt, air-fuel mixture.
      Thus, the burning process undergoes a transition from the
      combustion phase, heretofore described, to a second phase of the
      burning process, hereinafter referred to as the detonation phase,
      in which the remaining air-fuel mixture is detonated.<br>
      <br>
      As known in the art, detonation of the air-fuel mixture is
      initiated only when the pressure of the air-fuel mixture exceeds a
      suitable, threshold, pressure level. In a preferred embodiment of
      the invention, this threshold pressure level is exceeded
      substantially at the interface between portions 25 and 27 of
      combustion chamber 20.<br>
      <br>
      As described above, the transition from the combustion phase to
      the detonation phase preferably occurs when the burning front is
      substantially at the interface between portions 25 and 27. At this
      point, the pressure building resistance provided by section 24 of
      stimulator 22 is no longer required. Nevertheless, in a preferred
      embodiment of the invention, second section 26 of stimulator 22
      imposes some resistance on the propagating gas, as required for
      rapid yet complete and controlled detonation of the unburnt
      air-fuel mixture in detonation portion 27.<br>
      <br>
      Since the gas dynamic resistance suitable for supporting
      detonation is generally lower than that suitable for pressure
      build-up, rods 28 are generally thinner along section 26 and/or
      obstructers 30 are less spaced apart then obstructers 32, as
      described above. Generally, the gas dynamic resistance imposed by
      a given obstructer 30 or 32 depends on the volume taken up by the
      given obstructer which, in turn, depends on the thickness and
      length of rods 28 and the number of rods 28 included in the given
      obstructer. For given thickness, length and number of rods 28
      included in obstructers 30 and 32, the average gas dynamic
      resistances in portions 25 and 27 depends on the spacing between
      obstructers 30 and 32, respectively.<br>
      <br>
      The detonation phase of the burning process produces a high
      pressure gas dynamic pulse, i.e. a shock wave, released through an
      output aperture 34 of chamber 20. The output pressure, in a
      preferred embodiment of the invention, is approximately 80
      atmospheres or more. As known in the art, the shock wave released
      from aperture 34 or, preferably, a series of sequentially
      generated shock waves, may have various industrial application,
      such as cleaning of industrial machinery elements. It should be
      appreciated that the burning process described above, using
      perforated nozzle 18 and two-phase turbulence stimulator 22,
      provides a particularly efficient shock wave generator which is
      considerably more efficient than corresponding conventional shock
      wave generators.<br>
      <br>
      It is appreciated that careful positioning of obstructers 30 and
      32 along sections 24 and 26, respectively, is required in order to
      produce optimal two-phase shock wave generation. The present
      inventor has found that satisfactory results are obtained when
      obstructers 30 and 32 are spaced in accordance with the following
      empirical equation:<br>
      <br>
      wherein:<br>
      <br>
      X is the distance between successive obstructers, 30 or 32;<br>
      <br>
      d is the average diameter of rods 28 in each obstructer, 30 or 32;<br>
      <br>
      and<br>
      <br>
      m is the gas dynamic permeability of each obstructer, 30 or 32, in
      portions 25 or 27, respectively.<br>
      <br>
      It will be appreciated that permeability m may be determined from
      the following formula:<br>
      <br>
      wherein:<br>
      <br>
      s.sub.t is the cross-sectional area of the obstructer, 30 or 32,
      perpendicular to axis 23; and<br>
      <br>
      s.sub.c is the cross-sectional area of combustion chamber 20.<br>
      <br>
      <b>A working prototype, designed according to the present
        invention, was constructed on a combustion chamber having a
        diameter of 120 millimeters and a length of 4 meters. The
        obstructers in the first, 2.5 meter long, section of the
        turbulence stimulator included four rods, each having a diameter
        of 14 millimeters. The permeability of each obstructer in the
        combustion portion, determined as described above, was 3.5.
        Thus, according to the equation given above, the proper distance
        between successive obstructers in the first section was 40
        millimeters.</b><br>
      <br>
      The obstructers in the second section, the remaining 1.5 meters,
      of the turbulence stimulator included two rods, each having a
      diameter of 12 millimeters. The permeability of each obstructer in
      the detonation portion, determined as described above, was 2.
      Thus, according to the equation given above, the proper distance
      between successive obstructers in the second section was 20
      millimeters.<br>
      <br>
      Experiments with the above described<b> prototype yielded an
        output shock wave having a power level approximately 5-7 times
        greater than that of conventional shock wave generators. The
        energy consumption of the prototype was approximately 2-3 times
        lower than that of conventional generators.</b><b><br>
