        <br>
        <div style="text-align: left;">It may seem obvious that the
          surface of an airplane should be as smooth as possible to
          minimize aerodynamic drag, but that's not really the case. A
          bit of roughness can break up the boundary layer and improve
          efficiency. Sharks, with skin formed of rough scales called
          denticles
          (http://www.elasmo-research.org/education/white_shark/scales.htm),
          can slip through the water at speeds of up to 60 mph with
          minimal drag. This week, The Lindbergh Foundation
          (http://www.lindberghfoundation.org) awarded a grant to Dr.
          Amy Lang, at the University of Alabama
          (http://uanews.ua.edu/anews2007/nov07/shark112907.htm), to
          study whether the surface texture on the skin of fast-swimming
          sharks, capable of bristling their scales when in pursuit of
          prey, could be mimicked and used to reduce the drag on
          aircraft. "If we can successfully show there is a significant
          effect, future applications to reduce drag of aircraft and
          underwater vehicles could be possible," said Lang. The
          technology has the potential to increase aerodynamic
          efficiency up to 30 percent, with savings of billions of
          dollars and substantial reductions in fuel burn and emissions.<br>

        <div style="text-align: left;">TUSCALOOSA, Ala. – The stars of
          the “Jaws” films–sharks–have recently become the subject of a
          University of Alabama engineering research project. Conducted
          by Dr. Amy Lang, assistant professor of aerospace engineering
          and mechanics, the project explores energy conservation and
          boundary layer control in regard to a shark’s surface.<br>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div style="text-align: left;">The project findings will allow
          researchers to explore natural solutions for the reduction of
          skin friction over solid surfaces, which could result in new
          innovations and applications concerning energy conservation.
          This research will not only provide a greater understanding of
          the evolutionary development of sharks, but it will also
          investigate methods of flow control and drag reduction that
          can be easily applied to mobile vehicles.<br>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div style="text-align: left;">Research has shown the issue of
          reducing drag over solid surfaces can save thousands of
          dollars. For example, it is estimated that even a 1 percent
          reduction in drag can save an airline company up to $200,000
          and at least 25,000 gallons of fuel per year per aircraft. The
          resulting reduction in emissions into the air is equally
          impressive.<br>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div style="text-align: left;">Funded through a National Science
          Foundation Small Grant, the project is investigating the
          boundary layer flow over a surface that mimics the skin of a
          fast-swimming shark. The boundary layer is the area closest to
          the surface where viscous conditions cause drag–in this
          instance a shark’s skin.<br>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div style="text-align: left;">Lang hopes to explain why fast
          sharks that swim upwards of 60 mph have smaller denticles, or
          scales, than slower shark species. Evidence suggests that
          sharks with smaller denticles have the ability to stick out
          their scales when they swim, allowing them to swim faster and
          creating a unique surface pattern on the skin that results in
          various mechanisms of boundary layer control.<br>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div style="text-align: left;">“We hope to explain how a shark’s
          skin controls the boundary layer to decrease drag and swim
          faster,” said Lang. “If we can successfully show there is a
          significant effect, future applications to reduce drag of
          aircraft and underwater vehicles could be possible.”<br>
          <br>
          Lang’s research is being conducted using a water tunnel
          facility in Hardaway Hall. The water tunnel lab can increase
          the shark skin geometry by 100 times with a corresponding
          decrease in flow over the model. This makes the flow over the
          skin observable, and it allows for the visualization and
          measurement of flow using modern experimental techniques.<br>
          <br>
          In addition to the National Science Foundation Small Grant,
          Lang recently received a Lindbergh Grant for this research
          project. Lindbergh Grants are made in amounts up to $10,580, a
          symbolic amount representing the cost of building Charles
          Lindbergh’s plane, the Spirit of St. Louis.<br>

          In 1837, The University of Alabama became one of the first
          five universities in the nation to offer engineering classes.
          Today, UA’s fully accredited College of Engineering has about
          1,900 students and nearly 100 faculty. In the last seven
          years, students in the College have been named USA Today
          All-USA College Academic Team members, Goldwater scholars,
          Hollings scholars and Portz scholars.<br>
          <br>
          The University of Alabama, a student-centered research
          university, is in the midst of a planned, steady enrollment
          growth with a goal of reaching 28,000 students by 2010. This
          growth, which is positively impacting the campus and the
          state's economy, is in keeping with UA's vision to be the
          university of choice for the best and brightest students. UA,
          the state's flagship university, is an academic community
          united in its commitment to enhancing the quality of life for
          all Alabamians.<br>

          </big></div>
        <br>
        <div style="text-align: left;">Shark scales are tiny compared
          with those of teleosts (bony fishes) and have a characteristic
          tooth-like structure. Although they are often termed placoid
          ("plate-like") scales in older texts, most biologists today
          prefer the more descriptive phrase, dermal denticles
          (literally, "tiny skin teeth"). These denticles typically have
          a broad basal plate, a narrow stalk, and a broad, ridged or
          otherwise highly sculptured crown. In general, the crowns of
          dermal denticles have cusps pointing tailward, which is why a
          shark feels relatively smooth if stroked from head-to-tail but
          sandpapery coarse if stroked the other way. (An interesting
          exception is the Basking Shark [Cetorhinus maximus], in which
          the crowns seem to point every which way; Norwegians, who have
          commercially harvested this species for decades, have come up
          with a clever use for this peculiarity: they paste a strip of
          Basking Shark skin on the soles of their boots, preventing
          slippage on wet, rolling decks.) The White Shark is furnished
          with dermal denticles, too, and it is worth taking a moment to
          consider briefly their many functions.<br>

        </div>
        <br style="font-style: italic;">
        <div style="text-align: left;">Dermal denticles are built on the
          same engineering principles as the most durable of man-made
          compounds, such as fibreglass and reinforced concrete.
          Embedding a hard material inside a softer one combines the
          best properties of both, providing the rigidity of the former
          without brittleness and the plasticity of the latter without
          distortion. The dentine layer of dermal denticles is composed
          of a hard, crystalline mineral called apatite, embedded in a
          soft protein, our old friend collagen. Due to their
          microstructure, dermal denticles are about as hard as granite
          and as strong as steel. Not surprisingly, dermal denticles
          afford sharks no small measure of physical protection. Yet
          they do so without sacrificing mobility, like a built-in suit
          of chainmail armor. The dermal denticles of the White Shark
          have crowns shaped like miniature horseshoe crabs, so tiny as
          to be barely visible to the naked eye. These crowns overlap
          tightly, providing protection from both large potential
          predators — including other Great Whites — and tiny skin
          parasites.<br>
          <br>
          The denticle crowns of the White Shark are highly sculptured,
          each with three longitudinal ridges that terminate in a
          rearward-pointing cusp. Although it may seem counter-intuitive
          for an aquatic animal to be anything but smooth as possible,
          there are actually sound hydrodynamic benefits to be gained
          from such sandpaper roughness. How strategic roughness can
          yield aero- and hydro-dynamic benefits has elicited a great
          deal of research in recent years. Consider the humble golf
          ball. Those characteristic dimples are not created equal: the
          indentations around the equator of the ball are actually
          slightly deeper than those at the poles. This deceptively
          simple design feature grants a golf ball in flight and with
          the proper backspin an additional two seconds of 'hang-time' —
          increasing driving range by as much as 80 feet (24 metres) —
          and reduces the incidence of hooks and slices by as much as
          75%. Similarly, in fighter jets or fast ships, the secret to
          their phenomenal speed lies in fine, V-shaped grooves. These
          grooves must be very closely spaced — about as close together
          as the grooves on an old-fashioned phonograph record (Anyone
          remember those?). Such closely-spaced grooves appear to reduce
          drag by preventing eddies from coming in contact with the
          surface of a moving body. Nowadays, there is hardly an
          American military aircraft or vessel that does not somehow
          benefit from the fluid dynamic efficiency of incorporating
          strategically-placed, V-shaped grooves along the fuselage,
          hull, and foils. But, whenever there is a physical principle
          that provides an elegant solution to a practical environmental
          challenge, it seems that Nature always beats us to the punch.
          Collectively, the tiny, three-ridged dermal denticles of the
          White Shark create closely-spaced grooves similar to those on
          high-speed air or water craft. These denticles very probably
          impart similar drag-reducing properties to the shark. Thus,
          without understanding the first thing about golf balls or
          military craft, the White Shark has been employing many of the
          same fluid dynamics principles for millions of years.<br>
          <br>
          In a short but fascinating 1982 paper, Wolf-Ernst Reif and his
          co-worker A. Dinkelacker reviewed the hydrodynamics of dermal
          denticles in fast-swimming sharks. Reif and Dinkelacker found
          that the crowns of dermal denticles in the Shortfin Mako and
          other fast-swimming sharks are smooth and almost ridgeless on
          the tip of the snout and leading (anterior) edges of the fins,
          but elsewhere on the body the crown ridges are quite steep,
          with depths one-half to two-thirds their width. They also
          found that the alignment of these crown ridges varies over the
          body, closely approximating path-of-least-resistance flow of
          water over the surface of the shark. The smoothness of
          denticles on the leading edges of the snout and fins offer the
          least resistance to these areas of minimal boundary layer
          thickness. In contrast, the alignment of crown ridges with the
          'natural' flow-direction of water over the shark's body can be
          expected to maximize drag reduction by reducing turbulence,
          thereby preventing eddy formation. The arrangement of dermal
          denticles in the White Shark is probably very similar to that
          exhibited by the Shortfin Mako. Thus, like a dimpled golf
          ball, a grooved Great White may glide farther on a given
          amount of energy than would a smooth one.<br>
          <br>
          In a 1986 paper, biologists William Raschi and Jennifer Elsom
          reviewed the drag-reduction properties of shark dermal
          denticles. Raschi and Elsom examined the denticles of 15
          species of shark and found that those of fast-swimming pelagic
          species — such as the Shortfin Mako — are consistently smaller
          and lighter than those of sluggish or bottom-dwelling species.
          Therefore, the relatively small, light-weight dermal denticles
          of the White Shark are probably adapted for fast swimming more
          than armor-like protection — yet another compromise between
          form and function. In addition, they found that the Shortfin
          Mako and other fast-swimming species consistently had ridge
          characteristics nearer those values predicted as optimal for
          burst speeds. Raschi and Elsom also found that, despite
          growth-associated increases in the crown size of denticles,
          the height and spacing of the scales' longitudinal ridges
          remained nearly constant in all species examined. This
          suggests that some important functional feature may be
          maintained throughout a shark's life. That feature is very
          probably drag reduction — in a 1984 report, Raschi and
          ichthyologist Jack Musick discovered that the longitudinal
          ridge system created by shark dermal denticles is responsible
          for drag reductions as great as 8%. That percentage represents
          a substantial energy savings, and it seems unlikely that the
          White Shark would not take advantage of the benefits afforded
          by this mechanism.<br>
          <br>
          There is at least one further benefit of sharks'
          hydrodynamically sculpted dermal denticles: stealth. Despite
          pioneer undersea explorer Jacques-Yves Cousteau's poetic
          description of the marine environment as a "silent world", the
          ocean is full of noise. Mournful songs of lonely whales,
          exuberant squeals and clicks of cavorting dolphins,
          multitudinous croaks and yaps of reproductively-ripe fishes,
          and the incessant, static-like chorus of snapping shrimps vie
          with the mechanical rumble of ocean-going ships and the
          frenetic buzz of speedboats. If you were to lower a hydrophone
          (underwater microphone) near a school of teleost fishes, you
          would quite easily hear the sloshing sounds of water
          turbulence, created by their swimming movements. The large,
          overlapping scales of teleosts are not nearly as
          hydrodynamically 'clean' as the dermal denticles of sharks. If
          you were to place the same hydrophone near a cruising shark,
          no such swimming sounds would be heard. Sharks are, literally,
          "silent hunters". For the Great White, this hydrodynamic
          side-effect probably confers tremendous advantages when
          stalking prey: the hapless fish or sea lion almost never hears
          the shark that caught it.<br>

          --vThe present invention is directed to a micro-array surface
          that provides for either drag reduction or enhancement, hi one
          aspect, an aerodynamic or hydrodynamic wall surface that is
          configured to modify a fluid boundary layer on the surface
          comprises at least one array of roughness elements disposed on
          and extending therefrom the surface. In one example, the
          interaction of the roughness elements with a turbulent
          boundary layer of the fluid reduces the skin friction drag
          coefficient of the surface over an identical smooth surface
          without the roughness elements. <br>
