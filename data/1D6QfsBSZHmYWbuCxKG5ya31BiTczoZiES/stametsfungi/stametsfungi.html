      Paul Stamets believes that mushrooms can save our lives, restore
      our ecosystems and transform other worlds.<br>
      <br>
      Entrepreneurial mycologist Paul Stamets seeks to rescue the study
      of mushrooms from forest gourmets and psychedelic warlords. The
      focus of Stamets' research is the Northwest's native fungal
      genome, mycelium, but along the way he has filed 22 patents for
      mushroom-related technologies, including pesticidal fungi that
      trick insects into eating them, and mushrooms that can break down
      the neurotoxins used in nerve gas.<br>
      <br>
      There are cosmic implications as well. Stamets believes we could
      terraform other worlds in our galaxy by sowing a mix of fungal
      spores and other seeds to create an ecological footprint on a new
      planet.<br>

          (Turkey tail) mushroom and its fermented substrate each show
          potent and complementary immune activating properties in vitro</b><br>
        <b>Kathleen F. Benson, et al.</b><br>
      </div>
      <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b>The medicinal mushroom Trametes versicolor (Tv, Turkey Tail)
      is often prepared for consumption as a powder from the fungal
      mycelium and the fermented substrate on which it grew. The goal
      for this study was to evaluate the immune-modulating properties of
      the mycelium versus the fermented substrate, to document whether
      an important part of the immune-activating effects resides in the
      metabolically fermented substrate.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Conclusion</b><b><br>
      </b>The results demonstrated that the immune-activating
      bioactivity of a mycelial-based medicinal mushroom preparation is
      a combination of the mycelium itself (including insoluble
      beta-glucans, and also water-soluble components), and the highly
      bioactive, metabolically fermented substrate, not present in the
      initial substrate.<br>

          Reduce Viruses in Honey Bees</b><br>
        <b>Paul E. Stamets, et al.</b><br>
      </div>
      <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b>Waves of highly infectious viruses sweeping through global
      honey bee populations have contributed to recent declines in honey
      bee health. Bees have been observed foraging on mushroom mycelium,
      suggesting that they may be deriving medicinal or nutritional
      value from fungi. Fungi are known to produce a wide array of
      chemicals with antimicrobial activity, including compounds active
      against bacteria, other fungi, or viruses. We tested extracts from
      the mycelium of multiple polypore fungal species known to have
      antiviral properties. Extracts from amadou (Fomes) and reishi
      (Ganoderma) fungi reduced the levels of honey bee deformed wing
      virus (DWV) and Lake Sinai virus (LSV) in a dose-dependent manner.
      In field trials, colonies fed Ganoderma resinaceum extract
      exhibited a 79-fold reduction in DWV and a 45,000-fold reduction
      in LSV compared to control colonies. These findings indicate honey
      bees may gain health benefits from fungi and their antimicrobial
      compounds.<br>

          stormwater using mycofiltration</b><br>
        <b>Alex Taylor, et al.</b><br>
      </div>
      <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b>Pathogens from nonpoint sources are the leading cause of water
      quality impairments in US surface waters. This study assessed the
      capacity of basidiomycetous fungal mycelium on cellulosic
      substrates to remove Escherichia coli from synthetic stormwater
      under unsaturated vertical-flow conditions. The mycelium of
      Stropharia rugoso-annulata was tested in mycofiltration columns
      consisting of 18.6 L containers with mycelium grown on either wood
      chips or a mixture of wood chips and straw. S. rugoso-annulata
      mycofiltration columns were loaded with water spiked with 600–900
      cfu/100 mL of E. coli at low (0.5 L/min; 0.57 m/d) and high (2.2
      L/min; 2.5 m/d) hydraulic loading. Influent and effluent were
      monitored for thermotolerant coliform and E. coli using the
      Coliscan membrane filter chromogenic method. Alder wood chips
      infused with S. rugoso-annulata mycelium yielded a removal rate of
      around 20% relative to control filters. Wood chip and straw media
      appeared less effective with substantial net export of bacteria
      from both mycelium-infused and un-inoculated control media. The
      un-inoculated control media used in this study commonly exported
      high concentrations of thermotolerant coliform bacteria. On wood
      chip-based media, the presence of actively growing mycelium
      reduced the thermotolerant coliform exports by &gt;90% relative to
      the control media. The study highlights the limitations of using
      thermotolerant coliform to assess pathogen removal in cellulose
      rich ecotechnologies like mycofiltration.<br>

      <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b>Two naturally occurring chlorinated coumarins,

      6-chloro-2-oxo-4-phenyl-2H-chromen-3-carboxylate (2), were
      isolated from the EtOH extract of the polypore mushroom,
      Fomitopsis officinalis. The structures of 1 and 2 were deduced
      spectroscopically and confirmed by chemical synthesis. In
      addition, analogues of the coumarins were synthesized as
      7-chloro-4-phenyl-2H-chromen-2-one (3) and ethyl
      7-chloro-2-oxo-4-phenyl-2H-chromen-3-carboxylate (4), and 1-4 were
      physicochemically characterized. An extensive assessment of their

      activity against both replicating and non-replicating
      Mycobacterium tuberculosis as well as M. tuberculosis isolates
      with mono-resistance to rifampin, isoniazid, streptomycin,

        <b>Donald I Abrams, et al.</b><br>
      </div>
      <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b>Antiretroviral treatment (ART) regimens in HIV patients
      commonly cause significant lipid elevations, including increases
      in both triglycerides and cholesterol. Standard treatments for
      hypercholesterolemia include the HMG CoA reductase inhibitors, or
      "statins." Because many ART agents and statins share a common
      metabolic pathway that uses the cytochrome P450 enzyme system,
      coadministration of ART with statins could increase statin plasma
      levels significantly. The oyster mushroom, Pleurotus ostreatus,
      has been shown in animal models to decrease lipid levels - a
      finding that has been supported by preliminary data in a small
      human trial.<br>

          officinalis (Vill.: Fr.) Bond. et Singer (Agarikon) from the
          Pacific Northwest of North America</b><b>Paul E. Stamets</b><br>
      </div>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>ABSTRACT</b><b><br>
      </b>Polypore mushrooms have been used medicinally for thousands of
      years. The Greek physician Dioscorides first described the use of
      Fomitopsis officinalis, a wood conk (or agarikon), as a treatment
      against consumption in 65 AD. Its use as a topical
      anti-inflammatory agent also spans millennia. Other wood conks
      such as Ganoderma lucidum (Ling Chi or Reishi) have had a
      similarly long history of use in Asia. In the past 20 years, wood
      conks continue to be carefully explored for their immunomodulating
      and anticancer properties. More recently, mushrooms, including
      polypores, have been and are being explored for their
      antimicrobial properties. Of more than 200,000 pharmaceutical and
      natural products analyzed, and subsequent to the authors’
      submitting more than 100 in vitro cultures of mushrooms to the US
      National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) in
      coordination with the US National Institute of Health (NIH) and
      the US Defense Department (DOD)’s Bioshield BioDefense program,
      several tests show that the author's extracts of cultures
      originating from rare “old growth” polypore mushrooms demonstrated
      strong antiviral activity. Within verdant natural landscapes,
      trees hundreds of years old host ancestral strains of these
      elusive mushroom species. Species that are now rare, or in some
      cases thought to be extinct, still reside in the pristine old
      growth forests of the Pacific Northwest of North America. When
      clones from these mushrooms were grown in vitro and submitted for
      antiviral screening, several mycelial cultures produced
      antimicrobial agents effective against pox and other viruses.
      Notably, strains vary in their antiviral properties. Our mushroom
      genomes hold within them great potentials for staving off disease
      and barely have been explored. The fungal diversity within these
      genomes may prove critical for isolating the most active strains,
      similar to the lessons learned from the isolation of Penicillium
      chrysogenum strains that lead to the commercialization of
      penicillin, subsequently saving millions of lives. With
      deforestation, pollution, and industrialization, societies should
      reevaluate the importance of their natural forests in the context
      that they hold within them novel medicines of enormous
      socioeconomic and national defense importance.<br>

      <b>ABSTRACT</b><b><br>
      </b>The cultivation of the Royal Sun Agaricus or Agaricus blazei
      Murr. is discussed in detail. The particular temperature, humidity
      and environmental requirements are delineated, accompanied by
      recommended strategies for crop management. Fruitbodies grown from
      the same culture on sterilized sawdust have light pilei whereas
      fruitbodies grown from fermented manure-based compost have dark
      brown pilei, suggesting that substrate composition affects
      pigmentation during the expression of the fruitbody. Since cap
      pigmentation has been used as a taxonomic feature of some
      importance in the genus Agaricus, this study raises concerns about
      its taxonomic significance. The medicinal properties of this
      mushroom and its potential application in recycling are discussed.<br>

        <b>Controlling zoonotic disease vectors from insects and
          arthropods using preconidial mycelium and extracts of
          preconidial mycelium from entomopathogenic fungi</b><br>
      </div>
      <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b>The present invention utilizes extracts of the pre-sporulation
      (preconidial) mycelial stage of entomopathogenic fungi as insect
      and arthropod attractants and/or pathogens and can be employed to
      limit the zoonotic diseases they transmit. The fungus can be
      cultivated on grain, wood, agricultural wastes or other cellulosic
      material and extracts can be made thereof. More than one fungus
      and substrate can be used in combination with one or more
      antimicrobial, antiprotozoal, antiviral, and genetically modified
      agents that result in reduced spread of contagions and lessens the
      damage they inflict on animals, and plants.<br>

      <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b>Compositions, methods and business applications of using new
      and recycled cardboard infused with a plurality of saprophytic
      (including endophytic) and mycorrhizal fungi matched with seeds of
      plants (including trees, vegetables, herbs and grasses) whereby
      the cardboard can be sprouted by end-users to start ecosystems.
      Such containers may have carbon-credit value for companies and
      consumers when planted and grown as a carbon sink or carbon offset
      for the photosynthetic and mycelial sequestration of carbon
      dioxide. The relative weight of the Life Box's added seeds and
      spores does not significantly affect the total weight of the
      infused cardboard, thus not increasing transportation costs.<br>

      <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b>Disclosed are topical compositions comprising extracts of
      Hypsizygus ulmarius in amounts that are effective to influence
      LTB4-mediated chemotaxis and/or IL-1beta mediated adhesion of
      polymorphonuclear leukocytes. The hypsizygus ulmarius extract may
      be used alone or in combination with secondary anti-inflammatory
      and skin active agents, such as other mushroom and/or natural
      extracts. The secondary anti-inflammatory agents may or may not
      function by antagonizing LTB4-mediated chemotaxis and IL-1beta
      mediated adhesion. The extract may be incorporated into a
      cosmetically acceptable vehicle. The present invention includes
      methods of treating skin inflammation by applying to inflamed
      skin, anti-inflammatory effective amounts of Hypsizygus ulmarius
      extract in a defined treatment regimen.<br>
