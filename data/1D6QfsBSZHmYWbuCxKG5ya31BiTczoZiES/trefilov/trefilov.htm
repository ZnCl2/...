      <br>
      At the Institute for Problems of Materials Science located in
      Kiev, Republic of Ukraine, a scientific team led by Academicians
      Trefilov, Tovschuk [ Tovstjuk ] and Kovalyuk created a <b>solid-state






        energy cell which produces 850-1040 watt-hours/kilogram</b>, in
      laboratory prototypes. This is at least <b>35-50 times the energy
        density</b> of any known conventional energy storage devices
      developed in the West. The reliability of their claims regarding
      this technology has been verified by INEEL, DARPA and the AMTL. A
      key element of their crystalline lattice deposition method relies
      on the effects of a torsion field beam. Scientists working at
      Sandia Laboratories in Los Alamos, New Mexico, have reported the
      successful development of a thin-film solid-state energy storage
      device which reportedly demonstrates energy density in the range
      of 250-400 watt-hours/kilogram.<br>
      <br>
      <b>xxvi -- David Yurth, The Anthropos Files</b>, loc. cit. IPMS
      has also perfected the use of a specially modulated torsion field
      device to manufacture mono-molecular powders of strategic metals.
      Using this revolutionary manufacturing method, metals can be
      stored in conventional glass containers without involuntarily
      generating static electricity...<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      ...In 1992, I watched a demonstration conducted by two technicians
      from IPMS in the board room of the law firm of O'Melveny and
      Meiers in Newport Beach, California. They attached a piece of flat
      black material to a small clip suspended from a conventional
      chemistry lab test tube stand [single metal pole extending
      vertically from a cast iron base]. To the corners of this material
      they attached the leads from a conventional 9-volt battery, using
      small alligator clips, one attached at each corner. Within 20
      seconds, the top surface of the tarot-card sized flat black card
      became covered with a layer of ice crystals. Within 30 seconds, a
      continuous cloud of frozen ice crystals [looking for all the world
      like the vapor which rolls out of a bucket of water when a piece
      of dry ice is dropped into it] began to pour off the upper surface
      of the suspended card and onto the top of the 20-foot long board
      room table. Within a minute, the cloud entirely covered the board
      table and was pouring off the edge of the table onto the laps of
      the people who were seated around the table watching this
      demonstration.<br>
      <br>
      When the technician offered to allow someone to actually hold the
      "card" in their hands, everyone who had seen a demonstration of
      the Peltier Effect refused – in our materials science lexicon,
      Peltier materials get very cold on one surface but demonstrate
      compensating heat on the opposing side. So when the demonstrator
      disconnected the card and held it in his hand, everyone who
      thought they knew what was happening gasped. With a digital
      thermometer, the demonstrator measured the surface temperature of
      the opposing side of the card – it was 72 degrees F. The top
      surface of the card was -68 degrees F. It was extracting heat from
      the local address and dissipating it non-locally in the presence
      of a very small activating DC voltage field with sufficient
      efficiency to freeze free-standing CO2 from the atmosphere. <br>
      <br>
      In a different demonstration, IPMS scientists provided us with a
      material they referred to as an "energy accumulator." In their
      frame of reference, this material operated by capturing free
      electrons and warehousing them in energy wells defined by the
      upper and lower surfaces of a material they referred to as a
      "one-dimensional" crystalline lattice. The lattice was made of
      atomically engineered carbon, intercalated with atoms of other
      materials, in a way that created a series of virtually
      mono-molecular carbon films which were folded back and forth on
      top of each other. When viewed under our electron microscope, this
      material looked like an endless field of egg-carton peaks and
      valleys. When the peaks from the lower layer were brought into
      contact with the peaks from the upper layer, a virtual energy well
      was created, within which electrons were reposed while waiting to
      be directed elsewhere. This solid-state energy accumulator device
      demonstrated an energy density 1.4 times greater than gasoline.
      INEEL's report showed output results varying from 840-1024
      watt-hours per<br>
      kilogram over extended tests. <br>
      <br>
      When we submitted the six energy accumulator devices to INEEL and
      DARPA for examination and analysis, an important discovery was
      made. Scientists at INEEL weighed the battery containers [we sent
      six Diehard battery containers to IPMS because they had no
      containers to put their materials in] fully charged, they were
      significantly more massive than when they were fully discharged.
      Think about this carefully – this created a tremendous reaction
      from DARPA. The US government attempted to classify and confiscate
      these devices and would have succeeded except for the fact that
      our attorneys succeeded in disabusing them from this course of
      action by pointing out that this stuff belonged to another
      government-owned laboratory in a foreign country. The implications
      of this discovery are extremely important because this material,
      manufactured in the presence of precisely modulated torsion
      fields, proves that E does not equal MC squared. Never did. In
      this instance, energy [as represented by nothing other than
      electrons sitting still within the crystalline lattice of a
      carbonized film] manifests itself as measurably massive while
      sitting at rest. Again, Einstein was mistaken, and the Standard
      Model (of&nbsp; physics) is wrong. In this case, E equals M with
      no velocity at all...<br>

      FIELD: monocrystalline materials of high quality. SUBSTANCE:
      lamellar monocrystalline material showing low defect level and the
      corresponding distribution of impurities that allows to
      intercalate at least 3 mole lithium into van der Waals channel per
      one mole of crystalline material without significant crystalline
      lattice distortion. Also, change of Gibbs free energy does not
      depend of lithium concentration incorporation. Material is
      prepared by the sequence stages. Ampoule is filled with
      stoichiometric amount of chalcogenid element and bismuth under
      nonoxidizing atmosphere and sealed. Then ampoule is heated to
      temperature 5-10 C above of bismuth chalcogenid melting point and
      cooled to the room temperature. Obtained polycrystalline bismuth
      chalcogenid is contacted with seeding crystal with specific
      structure of crystalline lattice. Obtained harmless nondefected
      monocrystal of bismuth chalcogenid is cooled to the room
      temperature. Some admixtures can be added to the prepared
      crystalline material to obtain highly intercalated crystalline
      material. Obtained crystalline material is used as active battery
      member, thermoelectric device and capacitor. EFFECT: enhanced
      quality of material.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Background of the Invention</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The present invention relates to highly defect-free
      monocrystalline materials capable of intercalating high levels of
      guest species and a method of making the same. The present
      invention further relates to a highly intercalated layered
      crystalline material.<br>
      <br>
      Layered crystalline materials (hosts) can accommodate foreign
      species (guests) in the channels between the layers thereby
      forming intercalated materials. Intercalation compounds, such as
      graphite and transition metal chalcogenides, have been intensively
      investigated over the last two decades and have found utility in a
      number of fields, including batteries, photovoltaic cells,
      superconductivity and hydrogen accumulation.<br>
      <br>
      The hosts of interest to this application have anisotropic
      lamellar structures separated by van der Waals channels which are
      capable of accommodating small guest particles, such a lithium or
      hydrogen.<br>
      <br>
      Because of the weakness of a van der Waals attractive force, the
      van der Waals channels can readily accept guest species, which can
      be neutral or charged. The guest species fill the channel until no
      more sites are energetically available. The amount of guest
      species which occupy sites in the van der Waals channel is the
      loading capacity of the guest. "Loading" or 'loading capacity" is
      defined herein as moles guest species per mole host material;
      species" is defined as ions or uncharged atoms of elements. It is
      recognized that for many applications, increased loading capacity
      of the guest into the layered material would significantly improve
      device performance.<br>
      <br>
      Distortion of a layered crystalline material has been used to
      increase the channel width and thereby increase guest loading.
      U.S.<br>
      <br>
      4,288,508 reports a cathode active material for a battery having
      the preferred formula This TiS2, where y is in the range of
      0.15-0.20 and z can be as high as 3.25. However, increased loading
      in these materials is accomplished by using the larger sodium atom
      to pry open the van der Waals channels. This results in
      significant distortion of the TiS2 lattice.<br>
      <br>
      U.S. 4,309,491 reports a solid solution containing a bismuth
      halcogenide for use as a cathode active material. The guest
      loading process in the bismuth chalcogenide is reported to require
      up to six<br>
      Faradays of electrons, suggesting that six moles of guest are
      intercalated. However, it is also reported that there is
      substantial dependence of the discharge voltage on the guest
      concentration.<br>
      <br>
      Additionally, there is no indication that the bismuth chalcogenide
      has been prepared in a highly defect-free form with controlled
      lattice parameters.<br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, it is the object of the present invention to provide
      a mono-crystalline material capable of intercalating extremely
      high loads of a guest species in which a change in the Gibbs free
      energy (AG) of the material is substantially independent of
      intercalant concentration.<br>
      <br>
      Under these conditions, properties dependent upon AG, such as
      working potential of an electrochemical cell, remain unchanged.<br>
      <br>
      It is a further object of the invention, to provide a highly
      intercalated crystalline material having controlled lattice
      parameters.<br>
      <br>
      It is yet a further object of the invention to provide a method of
      making a highly defect-free mono-crystalline material with
      controlled lattice parameters capable of high guest loading.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Summary of the Invention</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The present invention overcomes the limitations of the prior art
      by providing a highly defect-free material with controlled lattice
      characteristics. When used in devices such as a battery it
      provides superior performance over prior art devices.<br>
      <br>
      In one aspect of the invention, a layered mono-crystalline
      material is provided having a defect density which is sufficiently
      low to permit intercalation of at least 3 moles of lithium within
      van der Waals channels per one mole of the material without
      significant distortion of the lattice. The material is further
      characterized in that its change in Gibbs free energy is
      substantially independent of the lithium intercalation
      concentration.<br>
      <br>
      In another aspect of the present invention, a mono-crystalline
      material having the formula, MeyChz, is provided where Me is
      selected from the group consisting of Bi and Sb, Ch is selected
      from the group consisting of Te, Se and S, y is 1 or 2 and z is 1,
      2, or 3. The material has a defect density which is sufficiently
      low to permit intercalation of at least 3 moles of lithium within
      van der Waals channels per one mole of the material without
      significant distortion of the lattice. The material is further
      characterized in that AG is substantially independent of the
      lithium intercalation concentration.Further detail concerning
      intercalation compounds and devices using these compounds are
      given in the following applications, filed on equal date as
      "Layered Crystalline Material Capable of High Guest Loading", and
      incorporated herein by reference: "Energy Storage Device",
      "Electrolytic Double Layer Capacitor", and "Capacitive
      Thermoelectric Device.<br>
      <br>
      In preferred embodiments, the material has a hexagonal crystal
      lattice structure, a defect density of less than 10'2/elm3 and a
      gradient of impurity defect distribution in the van der Waals
      channel inversely proportional to the direction of lithium
      intercalation. The monocrystalline materials can be further
      characterized in that a condensation of lithium occurs at a
      loading capacity of approximately three. The condensation is from
      a lattice gas to a quasi-liquid. The lattice structure may be
      rhombohedral or hexagonal. The monocrystalline material is
      preferably a single crystal. In preferred embodiments, the defect
      density is minimized and perfection of the lattice crystal is
      accomplished by using careful processing controls.In other
      preferred embodiments, the mono-crystalline material is used in a
      battery, a capacitor or a thermal electric device; although the
      monocrystalline material may be ground into a powder for some
      device applications.<br>
      <br>
      In another aspect of the invention, a method of preparing a highly
      purified bismuth chalcogenide consists of the following steps: an
      ampoule is charged with stoichiometric quantities of a
      chalcogenide element and bismuth; the ampoule is provided with an
      atmosphere selected to prevent oxidation and sealed; the sealed
      ampoule is heated at a temperature in the range of 5"C to 10 C
      above Tijq of the bismuth chalcogenide, the temperature is
      controlled to within a range of +0.5 along the length of the
      ampoule and for a time sufficient to melt the component materials
      and react to form the bismuth chalcogenide, whereby the ampoule is
      agitated during heating to ensure homogeneous mixing of the
      component materials; the material is cooled to room temperature at
      a controlled rate to form a homogeneous polycrystalline bismuth
      chalcogenide; the polycrystalline bismuth chalcogenide is placed
      in surface contact with a seed crystal of a specific crystal
      lattice structure; the seed crystal and polycrystalline bismuth
      chalcogenide are heated to a temperature which is in the range of
      30"C to 400C below This of the bismuth chalcogenide; a zone of the
      polycrystalline bismuth chalcogenide adjacent to the seed crystal
      is heated to a temperature which is in the range of 0 C to 150C
      above Tljq of the bismuth chalcogenide; the zone is moved along
      the length of the polycrystalline chalcogenide at rate in the
      range of 2 to 10 mm/Er, whereby a single crystal highly
      defect-free bismuth chalcogenide is formed; and the single crystal
      bismuth chalcogenide is cooled to room temperature at the
      controlled cooling rate.<br>
      <br>
      In another aspect of the present invention, a highly intercalated
      crystalline material is provided having a guest capacity in the
      range of three to ten moles within van der Waals channels per one
      mole of said intercalated material without significant distortion
      of the lattice. The guest selected from the group consisting of
      Group IA and Group IIA metals. The intercalated material is
      further characterized in that AG is substantially independent of
      the guest concentration. The intercalated material may have the
      formula, GxMeyChz, where G is selected from the group consisting
      of Group IA and Group IIA metals, Me is selected from the group
      consisting of Bi and Sb, Ch is selected from the group consisting
      of Te, Se and S, xis in the range of 3 to 10, yis 1 or 2 and z is
      in the range of 1 to 3.<br>

      </b><b>Description of the Preferred Embodiment</b><br>
      <br>
      The present invention has identified that highly defect-free
      crystalline layered materials with appropriate impurity
      distribution are capable of intercalating high loads of guest
      species into van der Waals channels of the material.<br>
      <br>
      Structure. A family of highly defect-free compounds of the
      formula, BiyChz, where Ch is Te, Se or S, y is 1 or 2 and z is in
      the range of 1 to 3, have been identified which permit extremely
      high loading capacity of the guest species, well beyond the
      loading capacity conventionally predicted by the lattice structure
      of the crystal and the model of the lattice gas. Solid solutions
      of these compounds, i.e., Bi2(Tel.xSex)3, are also within the
      scope of the invention. Importantly, high loading is achieved
      without significant distortion of the crystal lattice and without
      significant dependence of AG of the material on the intercalant
      concentration. AG has been correlated with the operating
      performance of the crystalline material when used in devices such
      as a cathode material in a galvanic cell.<br>
      <br>
      Although discussions are directed to a bismuth chalcogenide, it is
      contemplated that any layered material of requisite crystalline
      lattice parameters, guest loading capacity and thermodynamic
      behavior is within the scope of the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      The bismuth chalcogenide family is known to crystallize in
      rhombohedral and hexagonal lattices. The hexagonal and
      rhombohedral crystal lattices possess two types of energetically
      accessible sites which permit Iocalization of the guest species
      within the van der Waals channel. The basis for this observation
      has been presented in a co-pending application U.S.S.N. 07/784,525
      of which this application is a continuation-in-part and which is
      herein incorporated by reference.<br>
      <br>
      Figure 1 is a schematic representation of the two types of guest
      sites. A first site 22 is in the plane of the center of the
      channel, while a remaining site 24 localizes the guest species
      along walls 26 of the channel Total loading of the channel by
      guest is predicted to be three.<br>
      <br>
      Occupation of sites 22 is more energetically favorable at the
      beginning of intercalation than of sites 24. However, relative
      energy levels change during the intercalation process. All sites
      are sufficiently close in energy that "hopping" of guests from one
      to another site of differing energy is possible. The guest species
      behave as a 'lattice gas".<br>
      <br>
      The conventional model would seem to suggest, therefore, that the
      upper limit to guest loading without distortion of the lattice is
      three. However, we have discovered that much higher loading is
      possible For the specified lattice types shown in Fig. 1, orbital
      interaction in a filled van der Waals channel results in increased
      guestguest interaction and a decrease in the average guest-guest
      interatomic distance. This conversion from occupation of localized
      energy minima to free movement throughout the van der Waals
      channel is equivalent to a phase change. The lattice gas condenses
      into a high density state, which is defined herein as a
      "quasi-liquid phase".<br>
      <br>
      Because the new phase has a smaller average interatomic distance,
      additional guests can be introduced without distortion of the
      crystal lattice. Hence, a loading capacity of three is no longer a
      limitation to the system and rapid and high levels of guest
      loading is now possible. Loading capacity of lithium of up to
      eight and nine have been observed in the bismuth chalcogenide
      compounds of this invention.<br>
      <br>
      We estimate that the loading capacity in this system can be even
      higher, in particular, capacity of up to ten is considered
      possible.<br>
      <br>
      The class of compounds of the present invention has stable
      crystalline phases of hexagonal or rhombohedral symmetry which can
      be prepared with minimal defect densities and the appropriate
      impurity distribution. It is known in the prior art that the
      Bi2Ch3 class of compounds may crystallize in a rhombohedral unit
      cell of space group D%s (R3m, at=9.83 ; a=24.4" for bismuth
      selenide) containing five atoms. This crystal structure consists
      of layers formed by equal atoms in hexagonal arrangement. It is
      also given in prior art that a hexagonal unit cell for bismuth
      selenide (at=4.14 ; cho=28.55 ) also has been identified.<br>
      <br>
      In a battery, the discharge curve is directly correlated to AG of
      the cathode material (a bismuth chalcogenide). The following
      thermodynamic parameters which are related to AG must be
      considered when evaluating a guest/host combination: the entropy
      of distribution of the host/guest atoms, the energy of guest-guest
      and guest-host interactions, the change in the Fermi energy (AFe),
      and the lattice distortion (LD)-<br>
      <br>
      The lattice gas to quasi-liquid condensation of the system
      prevents significant distortion of the lattice. In the present
      case, loading over the range of intercalation from 0 to 8 or 9
      results in distortion only in the range of 2-3%. Such distortion
      does not contribute significantly to the Gibbs free energy of the
      system. In the invention, distortion is held not exceed 10%.In
      contrast, in prior art TiS2 intercalation of Lithium, the c-axis
      of the intercalated LiXTiS2, i.e., the axis perpendicular to the
      intercalated van der Waals channel, has been shown to increase by
      10% in response to as little intercalation as x=O to s=1. The
      change in entropy (AS) is significant only in the early stages of
      the intercalation process. AS is therefore very small over the
      course of the process and need not be considered in the Gibbs free
      energy equation.<br>
      <br>
      The characteristics of the crystal lattice have a great effect on
      the remaining two thermodynamic parameters, however. The energy of
      interaction, SDt7 is a measurement of guest-guest and guest-host
      interactions. Both of these are greatly affected by lattice
      crystalline characteristics. If the crystal lattice contains
      significant levels of defects and/or dislocations or has
      sufficiently uneven distribution of deflects, the energy minima
      associated with the localized sites will be disrupted and filling
      is not uniform along the length of the channel.<br>
      <br>
      Fermi energy level of the crystal is also effected by the
      interstitial and lattice site impurities and the lattice
      structure. The defect or impurity distribution is important in
      identifying acceptable crystalline purity. If all defects are
      clustered near the entrance to van der Waals channels, no guests
      can enter and guest capacity is low even though crystalline
      lattice purity is high. It is apparent therefore, that careful
      crystal growth is important to preparing layered crystalline
      materials capable of the high loading of the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Process<br>
        <br>
      </b>The following detailed description is presented to provide
      details of the crystal growth process providing highly defect-free
      layered crystalline materials with the specific lattice
      characteristics, such as defect distribution, of the present
      invention. The description which follows is for the bismuth
      chalcogenide family; however, it is contemplated that any layered
      material of requisite crystalline lattice parameters, guest
      loading capacity and thermodynamic behavior is within the scope of
      the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      Stoichiometric quantities of highly purified (99.9999% pure)
      bismuth and chalcogenide are charged into a quartz ampoule. If
      necessary, the materials are zone refined before use.
      Off-stoichiometry results in an n- or p-doped material with
      characteristic degradation of the lattice structure and the
      associated performance. The ampoule is evacuated to 10 7 mmHg and
      backfilled to a pressure of 10 mmHg with a small amount of inert
      gas, such as argon, or a reducing gas, such as hydrogen (3-10
      cycles), and then sealed. Hydrogen is particularly preferred
      because it reacts with oxygen during processing to prevent
      oxidation and decrease the segregation of chalcogenide by reducing
      its vapor pressure.<br>
      <br>
      A highly homogeneous polycrystalline material is prepared in a
      first processing step. The sealed ampoule is placed in a furnace
      at room temperature and heated to a temperature 5-100C above its
      melting point. The ramp rate, temperature and reaction time are
      selected for the final compound. The reaction conditions are
      listed in Table I for the preparation of polycrystalline Bi2S3,
      Bi2Se3, and Bi2Te3. The temperature of the furnace over the entire
      length of the ampoule is controlled to within +0.5 C. Careful and
      accurate control of the temperature is important because of the
      high volatility of chalcogenides.<br>
      <br>
      Temperature variation along the ampoule length causes segregation
      of chalcogenide which leads to off-stoichiometry. To optimize the
      temperature control along the length of the ampoule, a long
      furnace can be used. Additional heating coils can be used at
      furnace ends to reduce the temperature gradient at the furnace
      exits.<br>

      During the last hour of reaction time, the ampoule is agitated or
      vibrated to insure complete mixing of the ampoule components. The
      ampoule vibration preferably is in the range of 25-100 Hz and is
      accomplished by fixing one end of the ampoule to an oscillation
      source.<br>
      <br>
      Any conventional vibration means is contemplated by the present
      invention. After reaction is complete, the ampoule is cooled at a
      slow controlled rate.<br>
      <br>
      Once a homogeneous polycrystalline material is obtained, it can be
      further processed into a highly defect-free bismuth chalcogenide
      single crystal. Any known method of growing single crystals can be
      used, such as Bridgeman techniques, Czolchralski process and zone
      refinement techniques (recrystallization). In particular zone
      refinement has proved to be highly effective in obtaining high
      purity single crystals.<br>
      <br>
      Referring to Fig. 2, zone refinement is carried out in a quartz
      boat 40 containing a seed crystal 42 of the desired lattice
      structure. It is recommended that clean rooms levels of Class 100
      be maintained.<br>
      <br>
      The seed crystal 42 is oriented in the boat such that crystal
      layers 43 are horizontal. The entire apparatus should be
      shock-mounted to insulate against environmental vibrations. The
      boule 44 of polycrystalline material is positioned in surface
      contact with the seed crystal.<br>
      <br>
      The furnace comprise two parts, an outer furnace 46 for
      maintaining an elevated temperature along the entire boule length
      and a narrow zone 47 movable in the direction of arrow 48 for
      heating a small portion of the polycrystalline material. For
      production of hexagonal structure, the outer furnace 46 is
      maintained at 35"C below the melting point, and the zone 47, which
      is 2-3 cm in length, is held at 10 C above the melting point of
      the polycrystalline material. Unlike for the preparation of the
      polycrystalline material int he first processing step, the boule
      can in this step be rapidly heated to the operating temperature.
      The zone is initially positioned at the seed crystal/boule
      interface and this region is heated to the melting point of the
      material.<br>
      <br>
      The zone 47 is then moved slowly down the length of the boule.
      Zone travel rate is selected according to the particular
      composition and recommended rates are shown, along with other
      processing parameters, in Table II. Zone travel rate is an
      important processing parameter. If the rate is too great,
      crystallization is incomplete and defects are formed. If the rate
      is too slow, layer distortions result. The lower portion of the
      heat-treated boule in contact with the quartz boat is preferably
      removed before use. The process produces a single crystalline
      material having less than 1012/cm3 defect density and an impurity
      distribution which is inversely proportional to the intended
      direction of intercalation. The single crystal typically contains
      106 layers/mm with a spacing of 3-4 A/layer.<br>

      The above process can be modified slightly to produce crystals of
      rhombohedral structure, in which case a rhombohedral seed crystal
      is employed in the zone refinement process.In addition, to produce
      rhombohedral crystals, the furnace temperature is held at 300C
      below the melting point and the zone is maintained at the melting
      point of the p olycrystalline material.<br>
      <br>
      Depending on the composition of the material, there is a
      preference for either hexagonal or rhombohedral lattice structure.
      This is summarized below in Table III.<br>

      The above process provides a highly defect-free single crystalline
      material. The crystal can be further ground into particles for use
      in devices and each such particle is a mono-crystal. A grinding
      technique is selected so as not to introduce many defects and
      dislocations into the crystal. However, because of the weakness of
      the van der Waals attractive force, the crystal cleaves readily
      along the length of the channel without much danger of lattice
      distortion.<br>
      <br>
      Once formed, the material is tested by introducing it as the
      cathode-active material into a galvanic cell. The use of highly
      intercalated crystalline materials in an energy storage cell is
      disclosed in a co-pending U.S. application entitled "Energy
      Storage System" which is being filed this date. A standard battery
      is constructed using a lithium anode, a non-aqueous Lilo4
      electrolyte solution and the test material as the cathode. The
      amount of lithium that can be introduced into the van der Waals
      layer is determined by monitoring the moles of Faraday electrons
      passed through an external circuit during intercalation. A typical
      discharge curve 50 using a bismuth chalcogenide cathode prepared
      according to the invention is shown in Fig. 3.An acceptable
      crystalline material is capable of intercalating at least three
      mole of lithium per mole of bismuth chalcogenide and has discharge
      curve that is essentially flat, that is, a change of no more than
      0.1-0.3 V is observed over an intercalation capacity range of 0.4
      to 8 moles lithium. The flatness of the curve is an indication of
      the substantial independence of Gibbs free energy change on guest
      concentration.<br>
      <br>
      Condensation of a lattice gas to a quasi-liquid manifests itself
      in the discharge curve as a sudden change in the discharge
      voltage. The actual change in voltage is quite small, however, and
      is not significant to operation of the cell. Fig. 3 illustrates
      the smooth, flat discharge curve. In an enlarged portion 52 of the
      curve at approximately a guest load of three it is possible to
      observe a "blip" in the curve. This is observable under carefully
      controlled conditions.<br>
      <br>
      Once a highly defect free crystalline material is prepared as
      described above, it can be intercalated to obtain the highly
      intercalated crystalline material of the present invention.
      Intercalation can be carried out using conventional methods, such
      as exposing the crystalline material to the vapor phase of the
      intercalant or placing the crystalline material in a liquid that
      contains the intercalant or passing a current through an
      electrochemical cell where the crystalline material is an
      electroactive material in one of the electrodes. The preferred
      method for achieving high load of intercalant is the
      electrochemical method.<br>

      a capacitor having two electrodes and being in thermal contact
      with the mass to be cooled. The capacitor produces a cooling
      effect when it is repeatedly isothermally charged and
      adiabatically discharged.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Background of the Invention</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      This invention relates to solid state thermoelectric devices, and
      particularly relates to thermoelectric device materials.<br>
      <br>
      Conventional solid state thermoelectric devices operate based on
      the Peltier effect, which is achieved by passing an electric
      current through a junction of dissimilar metals. Such a device is
      typically constructed from two semiconductor blocks, one being a
      heavily doped n-type material and the other being a heavily doped
      ptype material. The blocks are connected electrically in series
      and thermally in parallel. In this arrangement, heat is absorbed
      at a socalled cold junction of the semiconductor blocks and is
      transferred to a so-called hot junction at a rate proportional to
      the current passed through the semiconductor blocks. When the
      current is applied in series with the n-type and p-type blocks,
      electrons pass from a low energy level in the p-type material to a
      higher energy level in the n-type material.This diode-like action
      causes heat to be removed from the cold junction of the two blocks
      and pumped through the blocks (in parallel) to the hot junction.<br>
      <br>
      Bismuth telluride is currently the most popular semiconducting
      material used for Peltier effect thermoelectric devices. It
      exhibits high mechanical strength, high electrical conductivity,
      and low thermal conductivity, three desirable characteristics for
      a thermoelectric device. Commercially manufactured bismuth
      telluride Peltier devices can achieve temperature differentials of
      approximately 650C, and can pump tens of watts of heat.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Summary of the Invention</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      In general, in one aspect, the invention features a thermoelectric
      device comprising two electrodes separated by an electrolyte. Each
      of the electrodes comprises a crystalline material characterized
      by the presence of van der Waals channels, the van der Waals
      channels being capable of accommodating the electrolyte within the
      channels to form a double layer of charge at interfaces of the van
      der Waals channels and the electrolyte when a voltage is applied
      between the two electrodes. The thermoelectric device exhibits a
      temperature decrease in a two-stage cooling process comprising
      application of a voltage between the electrodes to thereby form
      the double layer and replacement of the voltage with a load
      through which the double layer is discharged.Using selected
      materials, the thermoelectric device of the invention exhibits a
      0.5 C temperature decrease for each two-stage cooling process
      repetition, and thus provides a significant thermoelectric effect.

      "Electrolytic Double Layer Capacitor", and hereby incorporated by
      reference: "Capacitive Thermoelectric Device" and "Energy Storage
      Device".<br>
      <br>
      In preferred embodiments, the voltage application is controlled to
      charge said double layer isothermally and discharge the double
      layer adiabatically.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably, the crystalline material is a bismuth chalcogenide,
      and most preferably, each of the two electrodes comprises a
      monocrystal of the bismuth chalcogenide. In other preferred
      embodiments, the two electrodes each comprise monocrystalline
      powder particles of the crystalline material. The van der Waals
      channels of the crystalline material are adapted to accommodate
      the electrolyte by a training process comprising intercalation of
      electrolyte into the channels.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably the intercalation is produced by a training voltage
      sufficiently high as to achieve electrolyte penetration of the van
      der Waals channels, and most preferably, the training voltage is
      periodically reversed in polarity between the electrodes.<br>
      <br>
      In general, in another aspe ct, the invention provides a
      thermoelectric device for cooling a mass, the device comprising a
      capacitor having two electrodes and being thermally coupled to the
      mass, the capacitor providing a cooling effect when it is
      repeatedly isothemlly charged and adiabatically discharged.
      Preferably, the capacitor is a double layer capacitor, and more
      preferably, the capacitor is an electrolytic capacitor.<br>
      <br>
      In general, in another aspect, the invention provides a
      thermoelectric device comprising two electrodes separated by an
      electrolyte, each electrode comprising a porous material capable
      of forming a double layer of charge at interfaces of the porous
      material and the electrolyte when a voltage is applied between the
      two electrodes. The device exhibits a temperature decrease in a
      two stage cooling process comprising application of a voltage
      between the electrodes to thereby form the double layer and
      replacement of the voltage with a load through which the double
      layer is discharged.<br>
      <br>
      In preferred embodiments, the porous material comprises a compound
      of bismuth chalcogenide, activated carbon, and heat-treated
      graphite, and preferably, the electrolyte comprises sulphuric
      acid. Preferably, the voltage application is controlled to charge
      said double layer isothermally and discharge the double layer
      adiabatically.<br>
      <br>
      The thermoelectric device of the invention exhibits an accumulated
      temperature decrease produced by repetitions of a two-stage
      cooling process, namely charging and discharging. Its compact
      structure and elegantly simple operation provide significant
      advantages over conventional thermoelectric devices. Other

        Description of the Preferred Embodiment</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      We first present a discussion of the operational theory of the
      thermoelectric device of the invention. The thermoelectric device
      of the invention is a capacitive device characterized by the
      ability to accommodate a very high charge density, and
      correspondingly high energy storage, and very low internal
      resistance. The capacitor thereby achieves very high discharge
      power, and in fact, a discharge rate which is so fast as to be
      energetically adiabatic.<br>
      <br>
      Furthermore, very little resistive, or joule, heating occurs
      during the discharge process. As will be explained further below,
      these characteristics of the discharge process are so pronounced
      as to provide a cooling effect via the following device operation.
      The capacitive device is first isothermally "charged" to a very
      high charge density, thus in an isothermal manner, whereby the
      entropy of the device is decreased The capacitive device is then
      adiabatically discharged, whereby the entropy of the device is
      increased, necessarily resulting in a temperature decrease, or
      cooling, of the device. The charge/discharge cycle may thus be
      understood as a classical Carnot cycle, in which the cycle
      temperature is directly related to the cycle kinetics and changes
      in entropy.<br>
      <br>
      The inventors herein have recognized that while theoretically, any
      capacitive structure is capable of thermoelectric cooling,
      particular capacitive schemes and particular device materials are
      best-suited for achieving thermoelectric cooling. Based on the
      operational theory explained above, a capacitive cooling device
      ideally comprises a capacitive structure capable of very high
      charge density accumulation and very low internal resistance; in
      particular, the resistance of the capacitor electrodes ideally is
      held low. Given these criteria, electrolytic double layer
      capacitors, known to be capable of quite high charge
      accommodation, have been identified as providing a superior
      capacitive structure for a cooling device. Accordingly, the
      cooling device of the invention is based on a double layer
      capacitive structure.<br>
      <br>
      As an example of the charge density accumulation limitations of
      capacitors, the capacitance of a typical parallel plate capacitor
      is given by: analyze the operational electrical properties of this
      structure, consider first<br>
      C = where vg is a constant, 6 is the dielectric constant of the
      medium between the capacitor electrodes, S is the surface area of
      the capacitor electrodes, and d is the width of the medium
      separating the electrodes. The charge density accommodation, i.e.,
      the capacitance, of a given capacitor is thus limited by the
      geometry, i.e., the surface area, the electrode spacing, the
      material properties of the electrodes, and the medium separating
      them.<br>
      <br>
      The definition of capacitance for a double layer capacitor is
      further specified by the structure of the charged double layer and
      its geometry. This double layer comprises charge accumulation on
      the electrode surface and accumulation of ions at the electrode
      surface-electrolyte interface. Thus, for double layer electrolytic
      capacitors, the width d in the capacitance equation is given by
      the distance between the centers of the two regions constituting
      the double layer. This distance is on the order of angstroms,
      thereby providing a very large capacitance value for a given
      capacitor surface area.<br>
      <br>
      The capacitive cooling device of the invention provides an even
      greater increase in capacitance (and charge density accommodation)
      by providing an increase in surface area of the capacitor
      electrodes over conventional double layer electrodes, and through
      proper selection of the electrode material and the electrolyte.
      Furthermore, as explained in detail below, the selected electrode
      materials and electrolytes provide a dramatically low internal
      resistance, a parameter which is critical to the cooling device
      operation.<br>
      <br>
      In the capacitive cooling device of the invention, increased
      electrode surface area is obtained using a particular class of
      materials, namely intercalation compounds, which are characterized
      by a layered crystalline structure. The crystal layers of
      intercalation compounds comprise planes of molecules or atoms
      which are weakly bound together and separated from each other by
      van der<br>
      Waals regions. These van der Waals regions form anisotropic
      channels in the crystal lattice between the planes of molecules or
      atoms, resulting, in effect, in a atwo dimensional" crystal
      structure. Intercalation materials typically exhibit on the order
      of 106-107 layers per millimeter of material thickness.Due to the
      weak van der Waals force between the crystal layers, the lattice
      channels can accommodate the physical introduction, or so-called
      intercalation, of a guest intercalant species into them.<br>
      <br>
      The inventors herein have recognized that a particular type of
      intercalation compound, namely bismuth chalcongenides, including
      Bi2Te, and Bi2Se3, are particularly well-suited for providing van
      der Waals channels as an extension of electrode surface area.
      Electrodes composed of these materials, when used in combination
      with a suitable electrolyte, generate a highly uniform double
      layer of a desirable structure.As is well-known to those skilled
      in the art, bismuth chalcongenides exhibit a layered crystalline
      lattice which is layered at the molecular level, each layer being
      separated by a van der Waals channel having a width on the order
      of 3-4 A. Further material properties of bismuth chalcogenides are
      given in the copending United States Patent Application entitled
      layered Crystalline Material Capable of High Guest Loading,"
      herein incorporated by reference, being filed on the same day as
      the present application.Of the materials surveyed, the inventors
      have found that of the bismuth chalcogenides, Bi2Te3 exhibits the
      best electrical conductivity, and correspondingly, the lowest
      resistance, and is thus most preferable as an electrode material,
      while Bi2Se3 exhibits a lower conductivity, and thus is less
      preferable as an electrode material.<br>
      <br>
      It must be emphasized that while the bismuth chalcogenides are
      understood to provide superior electrical properties, other
      intercalation materials may be employed in the capacitive cooling
      device of the invention, and materials characterized by other
      crystal structures which provide high charge density may also be
      utilized as an electrode material. For example, activated carbon,
      a porous material, may also be utilized as an electrode material;
      the porous nature of activated carbon enhances the material's
      effective surface area.<br>
      <br>
      In one embodiment of the capacitive cooling device of the
      invention employing intercalation electrode materials, the van der
      Waals regions of the electrode material are employed such that the
      surfaces of the crystal lattice channels, although internal to the
      electrode material, contribute to the overall electrode surface
      area, and thereby dramatically increase the effective electrode
      surface area beyond that of its macroscopic surface. As described
      in detail below, surfaces of the van der Waals channels of the
      electrode material are capable of forming a double layer with an
      electrolyte in the same manner as the electrode macroscopic
      surface forms a double layer.Recognition and exploitation of this
      physical process has enabled the inventors herein to achieve the
      significant cooling capability in the cooling device of the
      invention as a result of increased charge density accommodation.<br>
      <br>
      Depending on the intercalation electrode material and the
      electrolyte selected for the cooling device, the van der Waals
      channels of the electrodes may need to be manipulated, or
      "trained" to effectively accommodate the electrolyte within them.
      The condition for this requirement is based on the structural
      dimensions of the van der Waals channels and the solvated complex
      radius of the electrolyte's solvated ions. If the complex radius
      of the solvated ions is larger than the width of the van der Waals
      channels, then the electrolyte will not be able to penetrate the
      channels and no double layer will be formed within the channels.
      Accordingly, a material having van der Waals channel widths which
      are less than the solvated ionic radius must be trained to
      accommodate the larger ions, and thereby trained to accommodate
      the electrolyte itself. The van der Waals channel width of bismuth
      chalcogenides is too narrow for electrolytes of interest to
      penetrate them, and thus a training" of bismuth chalcogenide is
      required. A detailed training sequence is described below.<br>
      <br>
      Electrode materials, like activated carbon, which are not
      intercalation compounds, do not require such a training process,
      because they do not contain van der Waals regions. As explained
      above, activated carbon provides an enhanced surface area with the
      surfaces of its internal pores, which accommodate electrolyte to
      form a double layer of charge.<br>
      <br>
      The charge density capacity and the internal resistance of
      electrode materials, and particularly intercalation materials, are
      dramatically impacted by the purity and defect density of the
      chosen material. This is manifested in the degree of ability to
      manipulate van der Waals channels to increase electrode surface
      area Impurities and crystal lattice defects distort the geometry,
      as well as the field characteristics, of the van der Waals
      channels, rendering them less accessible to intercalating species,
      degrading the channel surface structure and thus degrading the
      electrical and mechanical properties of the channels.<br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, it is ideally preferred that the material chosen for
      the capacitor electrodes be prepared using unique processes,
      developed by the inventors herein, yielding a highly pure and as
      defecbfree as possible material. To that end, the following single
      crystal growth process is preferred for bismuth chalcogenide
      materials. Alternative processes, providing less than ideally pure
      and defectefree material, may nonetheless be acceptable for
      particular cooling device applications. Those skilled in the art
      will recognize critical material parameters and corresponding
      performance results.<br>
      <br>
      In the preferred intercalation compound preparation process,
      stoichiometric quantities of highly purified (99.9999% pure)
      bismuth and tellurium (or other selected chalcogenide) are first
      charged into a quartz ampoule. If necessary, the materials are
      zone refined before use. Off-stoichiometry results in an n- or
      pdoped material with the resultant degradation of the lattice
      structure and the associated performance. The ampoule is evacuated
      to 10-7 minlig and barkfilled to a pressure of 104 mmHg with a
      small amount of inert gas, such as argon, or a reducing gas, such
      as hydrogen (3-10 cycles), and then sealed.Hydrogen is
      particularly preferred because it reacts with oxygen during
      processing to prevent oxidation and decrease the segregation of
      chalcogenide by reducing its vapor pressure.<br>
      <br>
      A highly homogeneous polycrystalline material is prepared in a
      first processing step. The sealed ampoule is placed in a furnace
      at room temperature and heated to a temperature 5-10 C above its
      melting point. The ramp rate, temperature and reaction time are
      dependent upon the final compound. The reaction conditions are
      listed in Table I for the preparation of polycrystailine Bi2S3,
      Bi2Se9, and Bi2Te3. The temperature of the furnace over the entire
      length of the ampoule is controlled to within +0.5 C. Careful and
      accurate control of the temperature is important because of the
      high volatility of chalcogenides.<br>
      <br>
      Temperature variations along the ampoule length causes segregation
      of chalcogenide which leads to off-stoichiometry. To optimize the
      temperature control along the length of the ampoule, a long
      furnace can be used. Additional heating coils can be used at
      furnace ends to reduce the temperature gradient at the furnace
      exits.<br>

      <br>
      During the last hour of reaction time, the ampoule is agitated or
      vibrated to insure complete mixing of the ampoule components. The
      ampoule vibration is in the range of 25-100 Hz and is accomplished
      by fixing one end of the ampoule to an oscillation source. Any
      conventional vibration means is contemplated by the present
      invention. After reaction is complete, the ampoule is cooled at a
      slow controlled rate.<br>
      <br>
      Once a homogeneous polycrystaline material is obtained, it can be
      further processed into a highly defect-free bismuth chalcogenide
      single crystal. Any known method of growing single crystals can be
      used, such as Bridgeman techniques, Czolchralski process and zone
      refinement (recrystallization). In particular zone refinement has
      proved to be highly effective in obtaining high purity single
      crystals.<br>
      <br>
      Zone refinement is preferably carried out in a quartz boat
      containing a seed crystal of the desired lattice structure, e.g.,
      the hexagonal lattice structure.<br>
      <br>
      It is recommended that clean rooms levels of Class 100 be
      maintained The seed crystal is oriented in the boat such that
      crystal layers are horizontal. The entire apparatus should be
      shock-mounted to insulate against environmental vibrations. The
      boule of polycrystalline material is positioned in surface contact
      with the seed crystal.<br>
      <br>
      The furnace comprises two parts, an outer furnace for maintaining
      an elevated temperature along the entire boule length and a narrow
      zone movable in a direction for heating a small portion of the
      polycrystalline material. The outer flirnace is maintained at 350C
      below the melting point and the zone, which is 2-3 Cm in length,
      is held at 100C above the melting point of the polycrystalline
      material. Unlike for the preparation of the polycrystalline
      material, in the first processing step described above, the boule
      can be rapidly heated to the operating temperature. The zone is
      initially positioned at the seed crystal/boule interface and this
      region is heated to the melting point of the material. The zone is
      moved slowly down the length of the boule.Zone travel rate varies
      with composition, and exemplary rates are shown, along with other
      processing parameters, in Table IL Zone travel rate is an
      important processing parameter. If it is too great,
      crystallization is incomplete and defects are formed If it is too
      slow, layer distortions result. The lower portion of the
      heattreated boule in contact with the quartz boat is preferably
      removed before use.<br>

      The above process can be modified slightly to produce crystals of
      rhombohedral structure, in which case a rhombohedral seed crystal
      is used in the zone refinement process. In addition, to obtain
      rhombohedral crystals, the finance temperature is held at 300C
      below the melting point and the zone is maintained at the melting
      point of the polycrystalline material.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably, a monocrystalline intercalation compound, and most
      preferably, bismuth chalcogenide, is grown using the process
      described above to produce monocrystalline electrode structures.
      For example, as one embodiment of the invention, monocrystalline
      bismuth chalcogenide electrodes are produced having a rectangular
      geometry with sides of 4 millimeters-long and 5 millimeters-long,
      and having a thickness of between 0.5-1 millimeters. It is
      preferable to metalize one of the faces of the monocrystalline
      material which is perpendicular to the plane of the van der Waals
      channels within the crystal.<br>
      <br>
      This metalization may consist of, for example, a nickel paste,
      which is spread on the crystal to form a 10-20 micron-thick metal
      layer. The metalization provides both a good electrical contact to
      the crystalline piece and enhances the rigidity of the crystalline
      piece.<br>
      <br>
      Alternatively, the monocrystalline bismuth chalcogenide material
      may be ground into a powder for forming the electrodes; such a
      powdered material is more easily manipulated than the single
      crystal material. The crystal grinding process may be carried out
      using, for example, a ball milling device, or other grinding
      device, to produce single crystal particles each having a diameter
      of preferably approximately 70 microns. Other particle diameters
      may be more preferable in specific instances. The crystal
      particles are then mixed with an appropriate compound to bind them
      together. While the binder acts, in effect, to "glue" the
      particles together, it must not completely electrically insulate
      the particles from each other. The binder material is selected
      according to the electrolyte.When an aprotic electrolyte solvent
      is used, the binder preferably consists of a 3% aqueous solution
      of carboxymethylcellulose, in which the particles are mixed; for
      other electrolytes, alternative binding agents, e.g., a 5%
      polyethylene dispersion in normal hexane, may be used. The
      resulting powderbinder mixture is placed into an electrode mold
      and then dried at room temperature. The electrode geometry, as
      determined by the mold, may be, for example, disc-shaped, as is
      conventional for capacitors, with an electrode thickness of
      between 0.3-1 millimeters. Alternative electrode geometries are
      also feasible.<br>
      <br>
      The grinding process described above produces some amount of
      crystal damage, and corresponding crystal defects. However,
      because of the weakness of the van der Waals attractive force
      between the crystal layers of intercalation compounds, these
      compounds cleave readily along the axis of the channels without
      much danger of lattice damage or distortion.<br>
      <br>
      The inventors herein have also developed a preferable process for
      producing electrodes of material combinations of bismuth
      chalcogenides, activated carbon, and heat treated graphite. In
      this scheme, a bismuth chalcogenide, such as Bi2Te3 may be present
      in the range of from 0 to 100%.<br>
      <br>
      The activated carbon material (ACM) may also be present in the
      range of 0 to 100% and the heat treated graphite (HTG) may be
      present in the range of from O to 40% of the ultimate composition.
      An electrode with higher performance but with higher cost will
      include a higher proportion of the bismuth chalcogenide whereas an
      electrode with lower performance and lower cost will include a
      higher proportion of the ACM. The particular proportions chosen
      will thus be based on a cost-performance analysis. The composition
      is held together with a binder such as polytetrafluoroethylene
      (teflon).<br>
      <br>
      If the electrode is to include a bismuth chalcogenide such as
      Bi2Te3, the process described above is employed to produce
      monocrystalline powder particles. The starting material for the
      ACM is a cellulose fiber. The cellulose fiber is heat treated at
      800-950 C for one to two hours in an oxygen free environment.
      Thereafter, it is activated in a steam atmosphere at 800-9000C for
      two to three hours. The material is then crushed into particles
      having diameters in the range of 4-8 mm and a length of 0.5 mm.
      This material will have a specific surface area of 1300-2500 m2/g.
      The heat treatment of the cellulose fiber material will result in
      an 85-90% carbon content.<br>
      <br>
      Production of the heat treated graphite (HUG) begins with
      crystalline flake graphite having an ash content of not more than
      2%. This material is ground and sorted to have a maximum diameter
      of 200 pm. The particulate material is then heat-treated in an
      electric furnace at a temperature in the range of 2200-2500 C in a
      vacuum atmosphere. The preferred vacuum is 104 mmHg. The material
      is maintained in the furnace for a time sufficient to reduce
      residual ash content to less than 0.1%. After this heat treatment,
      the powdered material is sifted in a vibration sifting device,
      resulting in particles having a diameter in the range of 80-200
      pm.<br>
      <br>
      The selected binder material, for example,
      polytetrafluoroethylene, is first processed in a mixer to obtain a
      bulk volume of 3-5 cm2/g. The binder is added to the powder
      material in a quantity not to exceed 20 wt% of the electrode
      weight.<br>
      <br>
      Once the starting materials are prepared, the following steps are
      carried out to fabricate an ACM electrode. First, the monocrystal
      bismuth chalcogenide powder, if any is to be included, the heat
      treated graphite, and the teflon are put into a mixer and mixed
      for 2-3 minutes at a speed of rotation not less than 4,000 rpm.
      Thereafter the selected quantity of ACM is added and the mixing
      process is continued for another 2-3 minutes at the same speed to
      obtain a material having a bulk volume of 4.3-4.7 cm3/g. A
      suitable material begins with 97% HTG and 3% teflon; ACM is then
      added to provide 80% of the total weight.<br>
      <br>
      This electrode material is then compressed onto a metallic
      substrate in a hydraulic press with a compression pressure of
      approximately 270 MPa. A suitable electrode size is 10 cm by 10 cm
      by 0.1 cm. A suitable substrate material is perforated nickel foil
      having holes whose diameter is in the range of 0.7-1.0 mm. The
      distance between the holes is in the range of 0.6-0.8 mm.<br>
      <br>
      Other perforation schemes are also acceptable. A preferred
      thickness of the metallic substrate is 0.1 mm.<br>
      <br>
      After the electrode composition is pressed onto the metallic
      substrate, the resulting electrode is annealed for 1-2 hours at a
      temperature of 100-140 C in a chamber evacuated to 10.1 mmRg.<br>
      <br>
      After annealing, the electrode is impregnated with a suitable
      electrolyte such as a 28-30% water solution of potassium
      hydroxide. The electrode is immersed in the electrolyte at room
      temperature under pressure for approximately 5-10 minutes.<br>
      <br>
      Using a suitable electrode production process, including either of
      the processes described above or another suitable process, the
      capacitive cooling device of the invention is assembled into the
      following scheme. Referring to Fig. 1, in the preferred device
      configuration 60, two identical electrodes, most preferably being
      bismuth chalcogenide electrodes 20, are separated by an
      electrolyte 30. The electrolyte 30 suitably consists of an aqueous
      solution of, e.g., alkali, or 1.0 M of LiClO4 in propylene
      carbonate, using bismuth chalcogenide electrodes. In this case, a
      separator, consisting of 2 layers of non woven polypropylene, each
      layer 100 pm-thick, and saturated with the electrolyte, provides
      mechanical support of the electrolyte.Alternatively, for various
      electrode materials, the electrolyte may comprises a 1.2 M
      solution of organic cation of perchlorate in a mixture of
      propylene carbonate in dimethoxyethane, an aqueous solution of
      potassium hydroxide, an aqueous solution of single valence metal
      sulphates, or other aqueous solution. Using the LiClO4 propylene
      carbonate electrolyte discussed above, a polypropylene separator
      is suitably impregnated with the electrolyte solution and is
      positioned between the electrodes 20. Because the separator
      material adds to the overall internal resistance of the device,
      the separator thickness should be minimized while at the same time
      taking dependent device parameters into consideration.<br>
      <br>
      The electrodes, held apart by the separator, are inserted into a
      supporting frame (not shown) and sealed in a pressing fond, As
      explained above, depending on the cooling device electrode
      material and electrolyte, the material may need to be "trained";
      in particular, some intercalation compounds must be trained to
      allow the electrolyte to penetrate the van der Waals channels and
      form a double layer of charge with the channels' 8surfaces.
      Bismuth chalcogenides, while being preferred for their electrical
      properties, are one type of intercalation material which requires
      this training process. Accordingly, "training" is aprocess,
      described below, whereby electrolyte (and ions) are driven within
      the van der Waals channels to facilitate flow of electrolyte into
      and out of the channels.While the process will be described for
      this material, it must be recognized that the same procedure may
      be applied to other materials.<br>
      <br>
      Referring to Fig. 2A, there is shown a capacitive cooling device
      60 having two bismuth chalcogenide electrodes 20a, 20b at the
      start of the training process. The dimensions of the electrodes'
      van der Waals channels 70a, 70b are greatly exaggerated for
      clarity, and it must be recalled that each electrode is comprised
      of on the order of 106-107 such channels. Between the two
      electrodes is positioned a LiClO4-based electrolyte 30. During the
      training process, the power supply 40 is set to provide a voltage
      which is greater than the faraday potential for cation
      intercalation, and thus the voltage depends directly on the
      particular combination of device electrode material and
      electrolyte employed.<br>
      <br>
      Given a particularly chosen electrode-electrolyte combination,
      those skilled in the art will recognize that the corresponding
      faraday potential may be determined in a standard table of
      material systems and faraday voltages.<br>
      <br>
      At the start of the electrode training, when a voltage above the
      faraday voltage is applied to the device, the electrode 20b
      connected to the positive terminal of the power supply accumulates
      a positive surface charge. The surfaces of the van der Waals
      channels 70b of the electrode likewise accumulate this positive
      surface charge. Correspondingly, both the macroscopic surface and
      the surfaces of the van der Waals channels 70a of the electrode
      20a connected to the negative terminal of the power supply
      accumulate a negative surface charge.<br>
      <br>
      In response to this surface charge configuration, free Li+ ions 72
      readily intercalate the negatively charged electrode 20a, because
      of the favorable charge and energy configuration, and because
      their ionic radius is relatively smaller than the width of the van
      der Waals channels. In addition, solvated Li+ complexes 74 move
      toward the negatively charged electrode surface and solvated Cl04
      complexes 76 move toward the positively charged electrode
      surface.The positively charged electrode's van der Waals channels
      70b, being 3-4 A-wide (as occurring before the training process)
      are too small for the ClO4- complexes to penetrate within them;
      the solvated Li' complexes, however, do to a small degree
      penetrate the 3-4 A-wide channels 70a of the negatively charged
      electrode 20a, effectively being transported along with the free
      Li+ ions to the electrode surface and within the electrode
      channels. As a result, the solvated Li+ complexes slightly widen
      the channels that they partially enter in the negatively charged
      electrode.<br>
      <br>
      In order to cause the solvated Li+ complexes to penetrate the
      opposite electrode 20b, the polarity of the power supply is
      reversed. Then, the accumulated surface charge distribution
      reverses; the previously positively charged electrode now
      accumulates negative surface charge, and attracts the free Lif
      ions 72 and solvated complexes 74. The free Lif ions 72 readily
      intercalate the channels and the solvated complexes 74 again
      partially enter the corresponding van der Waals channels, and
      thereby slightly widen the channels.<br>
      <br>
      Referring to Fig 2B, repetition of this process of voltage
      polarity switching progressively widens the van der Waals channels
      of each of the electrodes 20a, 20b. Throughout the process, the
      voltage may be increased, depending on the initially applied
      voltage, to thereby increase the attraction of the ions and
      electrolyte to the van der Waals channels.At an intermediate point
      in the training process, as depicted in the figure, the solvated
      Li+ complexes 74, as well as the free Lil ions, will be able to
      completely penetrate the widened channels 70b of the electrode
      70b, which is shown to be currently negatively charged The
      solvated ClO4 complexes, being of a larger size than the solvated
      Li complexes, will not yet be able to completely penetrate the
      channels of the currently positively charged electrode 70a,
      however.<br>
      <br>
      At the end of the training process period, referring to Fig. 2C,
      both the solvated ClQ complexes 76 and the solvated Li+ complexes
      74 are able to completely penetrate the van der Waals channels
      70a, 70b, of both electrodes, 20a, 20b. As shown in Fig. 2'), at
      this time, electrically neutral electrolyte (including both ClQ
      complexes 76 and Li+ complexes 74) is thereby able to completely
      penetrate the van der Waals channels and create an electric double
      layer of charge 80, 82 and 84, 86 at the electrode-electrolyte
      interface throughout the van der Waals channels of each electrode,
      in a manner similar to that which occurs at the macroscopic
      surface of the electrodes. This penetration of electrolyte
      throughout the crystal channels forms the basis for achieving
      dramatic charge density increases that result in the cooling
      effect achieved by the invention.<br>
      <br>
      The extent of training required to achieve penetration of the
      electrolyte within the electrodes' van der Waals channels is
      critically dependent on the particular combination of electrode
      material and electrolyte employed. The width of the electrode van
      der Waals channels before undergoing any training process and the
      radius of the solvated complexes in the electrolyte determine the
      training required; the larger the complex radius and the smaller
      the van der Waals channels' width, the longer the training time
      requirement. For the electrode material Bi2Te3 and an LiCl04-based
      electrolyte, the training preferably consists of about 20 training
      cycles of approximately 30 minutes each, where the polarity of the
      power supply is reversed with each cycle. For specific capacitive
      device requirements, this training may be adjusted, however.With
      less training, a lower degree of electrolyte penetration within
      the channels would be achieved, and a correspondingly lower double
      layer capacitance would result. Thus, for achieving the maximum
      possible capacitance of a given electrode, the training should be
      maximized. Those skilled in the art will recognize that a
      preferable training procedure may be empirically determined for a
      given electrode-electrolyte combination and charge density
      accommodation goal.<br>
      <br>
      Alternative training processes are within the intended scope of
      the invention. For example, the voltage polarity may be maintained
      constant in the above process, or a charge-discharge process may
      be employed to widen the van der Waals channels. In such a
      process, a voltage above the faraday potential is applied between
      the electrodes, in the manner discussed above, for a period of
      time, and then the capacitor is discharged across an appropriate
      load. If the voltage polarity is maintained constant during this
      process, or if the voltage polarity is not switched during the
      training process first described, one of the electrodes may not
      achieve widened channels, depending on the electrode material and
      electrolyte composition.For example, using Bi2Te3 electrodes and a
      LiClO4-based electrolyte in a training procedure in which the
      voltage polarity is constant, the electrode having the negative
      polarity will be intercalated with free and solvated Li+ complex
      (and thereby accommodate electrolyte), but the electrode of
      positive polarity will not have the benefit of free Li+ ions and
      complexes beginning to open its lattice channels, and thus the
      solvated ClOd complexes will not widen those channels to
      accommodate electrolyte; as a result, the electrode of positive
      polarity will not provide the extended van der Waals surfaces.<br>
      <br>
      Of particular importance is the fact that the training process
      does not deform or distort the crystal planes of the layered
      crystalline electrode material to any significant extent. The
      extent of crystal plane deformation is related to the starting
      purity and defect density of the electrode material, as well as
      other properties resulting from the growth process; fewer initial
      defects in the crystal result in fewer crystal plane deformation
      sites caused by the training. With little or no crystalline plane
      distortion at the end of training, the electrodes' van der Waals
      channel surfaces are uniform and stable, and can correspondingly
      charge and discharge the double layer in a short time period. In
      addition, the internal resistance of the material is maintained
      very low. These conditions provide for the adiabatic discharge
      mechanism relied on by the cooling device of the invention.Also of
      importance is the fact that the after the training process widens
      the van der Waals channels to accommodate the electrolyte, the
      channels do not later shrink to their original width.<br>
      <br>
      It should be emphasized that alternative materials, like compounds
      including activated carbon, are also suitable electrode materials
      and do not require a training process<br>
      <br>
      Referring now to Fig. 3, the cooling device of the invention is
      operated in the following configuration. The capacitive device
      structure 60 is thermally isolated from the ambient via a
      calorimeter 35, or any suitable insulating container. The device
      is connected in a parallel charging-discharging circuit via, for
      example a switch 62. This circuit is external to the calorimeter
      35. The charging circuit comprises a power supply 40 and an
      electrical control component 64, e.g., a current limiter, for
      limiting the speed with which the power supply charges the double
      layer of the capacitive device.The discharging circuit comprises
      an appropriate load 65, e.g., a wire, resistor, or other load
      element. The load element is suitably selected based on the charge
      density accumulation of the capacitive device to achieve the
      highest possible discharge speed A thermocouple device 66 may be
      positioned in proximity to the cooling device 60 to measure the
      cooling effect. Such a thermocouple device might typically include
      a meter 68 for indicating the cooling effect measurement.<br>
      <br>
      In operation, the capacitive structure 60 is first connected to
      the power supply via an appropriate control of the switch 62, at
      which time the capacitive structure accommodates a charged double
      layer. The current limiter 64 produces a "trickle charge" effect
      and thereby controls the speed of the charging operation such that
      it proceeds slowly enough for isothermal conditions to be
      maintained at the device. A resistor or transistor-based device
      may suitably be used as a current limiter. Once the capacitive
      structure has accumulated a characteristic charge density, the
      switch 62 is controlled to discharge the capacitive structure
      across the load 65. Due to the very high charge density and very
      low internal resistance of the capacitive structure, and using a
      preferably low load resistance, the structure discharges at a
      speed approaching adiabatic conditions.As a result, during the
      discharge operation, the temperature of the capacitive structure
      decreases. Repetition of the charge-discharge process results in
      accumulation of this cooling effect.<br>
      <br>
      Based on thermodynamic principles, the cooling mechanism results
      from the adiabatic entropy increase produced when the capacitive
      structure is discharged. As required by the second law of
      thermodynamics, an adiabatic increase in entropy results in a
      temperature decrease. The isothermal capacitive charging process
      results in an ordering, and corresponding entropy decrease, which
      is, in effect, released during the discharge process. Based on
      this phenomena, it is recognized that electrode materials
      exhibiting a high degree of order are more effective in the
      cooling device than materials of lesser degrees of order. "Degree
      of order is here meant to describe the impact of crystal purity,
      defect density, uniformity, and other related structural and
      electrical properties. For example, a monocrystalline electrode
      structure is understood to provide a larger entropy change and
      corresponding temperature decrease than a polyerystalline
      electrode structure.<br>
      <br>
      A BiaTe3, LiCl04-based cooling device of 20 mm in size has been
      demonstrated to achieve a cooling effect of 0.5-0.7 C per
      charge-discharge cycle (each cycle consists of one charging and
      discharging process). This significant cooling effect is
      cumulative as cycles are continued, and has been demonstrated to
      proceed until the electrolyte froze. Preferably, each charge and
      discharge phase of each cycle is given 1 second to complete.The
      superior charge accommodation and low internal resistance of this
      device are understood to enhance the cooling mechanism--the device
      charge capacity is between 30-100 farads per cubic centimeter and
      the device internal resistance approaches approximately 0.02
      Q-cm2. This extremely low internal resistance provides the ability
      to achieve high power in the capacitor discharge. Theoretically, a
      monocrystalline capacitor structure of pure and defect-free
      bismuth chalcogenide would exhibit 1000 farads per cubic
      centimeter and would provide an even higher discharge rate.<br>
      <br>
      It must be understood that the capacitive cooling device of the
      invention may employ other materials and electrolytes and still
      achieve a cooling effect; the device performance is, however,
      effected by the particularly chosen combination of materials and
      electrolytes. For example, a cooling device consisting of
      activated carbon electrodes and, employing, e.g., sulphuric acid
      as an electrolyte, while still achieving the cooling effect, is
      somewhat less efficient than a device consisting of bismuth
      chalcogenide electrodes.<br>
      <br>
      Considering that the Bi2T#, liiClO4-based cooling device achieves
      a degree of cooling which is great enough to freeze the
      electrolyte, alternative, low freezing-point electrolyte systems
      may be employed for appropriate electrode materials. For example,
      in theory, the use of propylene carbonate, which has a freezing
      point of -60 C, as an electrolyte would provide the ability to
      achieve a greater degree of cooling.<br>
      <br>
      The inventors herein have recognized that the cooling capability
      provided by the capacitive cooling device of the invention may be
      employed in a myriad of applications where a solid state cooling
      device is preferable over a conventional condensation-tgpe cooling
      device. Such applications are characterized by space, weight,
      power, or material limitations (as in the case of replacements for
      freon- based systems) and include cooling of, e.g., electronic
      components, medical equipment, optical fiber systems, food
      refrigeration devices, chemical analysis devices, and an expansive
      variety of other systems.<br>
      <br>
      Other embodiments of cooling device materials, training schemes,
      modes of operation, and application are intended as included
      within the spirit and scope of the invention.<br>
