      Water-Gen Ltd. develops technology-based solutions in two fields:<br>
      1. Water supply for military and civilian applications.<br>
      2. Air management technologies for home and industrial
      applications.<br>
      <br>
      <b>About Water-Gen</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Water-Gen has begun its operation in the defense market, designing
      state-of-the-art solutions for water supply. Among these are
      atmospheric water generation (drinking water-from-air), treatment
      of air conditioning run-off water, and battery-operated mobile
      water purification units. The products are designated as ground
      installations, vehicle-mounted, and man-portable. The company has
      been selling its products to customers such as the US Army, UK
      Army, Israel defense Force, French Army, and others.<br>
      <br>
      Atmospheric drinking water generation can also be regarded as air
      dehumidification. This field includes common home appliances such
      as laundry dryers, air dehumidifiers, air conditioners, dry
      storage, etc. In these areas, Water-Gen technologies can decrease
      energy consumption significantly by using inexpensive (mostly
      simple plastic), small size, and highly efficient methods and
      components.<br>

      Infantry troops on urban combat missions carry water in flasks and
      water tanks. This mode of transport limits the amount of water
      that can be carried because of its weight and volume. On many
      occasions, troops encounter local water sources such as water
      tanks on roofs and water from wells, which are unauthorized for
      use. "Spring" is a small water purification unit that fits into a
      backpack and is suitable for a platoon or squadron. The device can
      filter 180 liters (48 gallons) per standard battery. The unit
      produced fresh, pure water from non-saline water sources, e.g.,
      water for agriculture, water tanks on roofs on captured building,
      wells, etc. The device is small and light-weight, and reduces the
      logistics needed to supply large amounts of water to troops during
      operations.<br>

      Tel Aviv, Israel (CNN) -- Water. A vital nutrient, yet one that is
      inaccessible to many worldwide.<br>
      <br>
      The World Health Organization reports that 780 million people
      don't have access to clean water, and 3.4 million die each year
      due to water-borne diseases. But an Israeli company thinks it can
      play a part in alleviating the crisis by producing drinking water
      from thin air.<br>
      <br>
      Water-Gen has developed an Atmospheric Water-Generation Units
      using its "GENius" heat exchanger to chill air and condense water
      vapor.<br>
      <br>
      "The clean air enters our GENius heat exchanger system where it is
      dehumidified, the water is removed from the air and collected in a
      collection tank inside the unit," says co-CEO Arye Kohavi.<br>
      <br>
      "From there the water is passed through an extensive water
      filtration system which cleans it from possible chemical and
      microbiological contaminations," he explains. "The clean purified
      water is stored in an internal water tank which is kept
      continuously preserved to keep it at high quality over time."<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>Energy efficient</b><br>
      <br>
      Capturing atmospheric humidity isn't a ground-breaking invention
      in itself -- other companies already sell atmospheric water
      generators for commercial and domestic use -- but Water-Gen says
      it has made its water generator more energy efficient than others
      by using the cooled air created by the unit to chill incoming air.<br>
      <br>
      "Several companies tried to extract water from the air," says
      Kohavi. "It looks simple, because air conditioning is extracting
      water from air. But the issue is to do it very efficiently, to
      produce as much water as you can per kilowatt of power consumed."<br>
      <br>
      He adds: "When you're very, very efficient, it brings us to the
      point that it is a real solution. Water from air became actually a
      solution for drinking water."<br>
      <br>
      The system produces 250-800 liters (65-210 gallons) of potable
      water a day depending on temperature and humidity conditions and
      Kohavi says it uses two cents' worth of electricity to produce a
      liter of water.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>Civilian uses</b><br>
      <br>
      Developed primarily for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), Water-Gen
      says it has already sold units to militaries in seven countries,
      but Kohavi is keen to stress that the general population can also
      benefit from the technology.<br>
      <br>
      He explains: "We believe that the products can be sold to
      developing countries in different civilian applications. For
      example in India, [drinking] water for homes is not available and
      will also be rare in the future. The Atmospheric Water-Generation
      Unit can be built as a residential unit and serve as a perfect
      water supply solution for homes in India."<br>
      <br>
      Kohavi says Water-Gen's units can produce a liter of water for 1.5
      Rupees, as opposed to 15 Rupees for a liter of bottled water.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Dirty water</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Another product Water-Gen has developed is a portable water
      purification system. It's a battery-operated water filtration unit
      called Spring. Spring is able to filter 180 liters (48 gallons) of
      water, and fits into a backpack -- enabling water filtration on
      the go.<br>
      <br>
      "You can go to any lake, any place, any river, anything in the
      field, usually contaminated with industrial waste, or anything
      like that and actually filter it into the best drinking water that
      exists," says Kohavi.<br>
      This unit gives logistic independence for the forces and make us
      ensure that we provide the soldiers high quality water.<br>
      Major Alisa Zevin, head of the Facilities and Specialized
      Equipment, IDF<br>
      <br>
      Major Alisa Zevin, head of the Facilities and Specialized
      Equipment Section for the IDF, says the unit is revolutionary for
      them.<br>
      <br>
      "This unit gives logistic independence for the forces and make us
      ensure that we provide the soldiers high quality water," she says.<br>
      <br>
      In 2013, the IDF took Spring to the Philippines after Typhoon
      Haiyan devastated the island country and left 4.2 million people
      affected by water scarcity. The system filtered what was
      undrinkable water into potable water, and that is what Water-Gen
      hopes to accomplish elsewhere where the technology is needed.<br>
      <br>
      "It's something as a Westerner you cannot understand because you
      have a perfect water in the pipe, but people are dying from lack
      of water," says Kohavi.<br>
      <br>
      Although Water-Gen's developments aren't a solution for the water
      crisis, Kohavi believes that the technology can do for countries
      that lack clean water, such as Haiti, what it has done for the
      Philippines. It can be the technology used to not only to filter
      water, but to save lives.<br>
      <br>
      "They could actually bring solution, perfect solution, to the
      people over there," says Kohavi. "For the kids ... They can use
      the technology to filter water in the field. People are going days
      just to carry water. And all our solutions can be an alternative
      for that."<br>

      </div>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>Abstract </b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      A system of managing water production in a vehicle. The system
      comprises a water conducting element set to receive and conduct
      water generated as a product of an operation of a vehicle air
      conditioner of the vehicle to a water container, a gauge that
      measures the amount of water in the water container, and a manager
      that receives the measurement and instructs the operation
      accordingly.<br>
      <br>
      <b>FIELD AND BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0002] The present invention, in some embodiments thereof, relates
      to method and device of producing and managing water supply and,
      more particularly, but not exclusively, to method and device of
      producing and managing water supply in vehicles.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] The availability of fresh, purified drinking water is
      highly desirable in virtually every environment and circumstance.
      For example, individuals in homes and offices often install
      complex and expensive filtration systems, or buy small individual
      bottles of spring water for personal consumption purposes. Many
      machines also employ various types of water and air filtration
      systems to create water that is safe to drink.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] For example U.S. Pat. No. 6,237,352 filed on May 29, 2001
      describes a machine capable of generating and dispensing potable
      water. The features of the machine include continuous water
      filtration, a durable primary outer housing unit designed to
      minimize damage during transportation and handling, and a hot gas
      injection system designed to allow the generation of water from
      ambient air at temperatures as low as 50[deg.] F. Another example
      is found in U.S. Patent Application No. 2007/101862 filed on Nov.
      7, 2005 that describes a water production unit that uses liquid
      desiccant and vehicle exhaust for extracting water from air.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Another example is found in U.S. Pat. No. 7,043,934, filed
      on Feb. 4, 2004 describes a water making device that collects the
      moisture contained in the atmosphere and condenses it into high
      purity water. In one embodiment, ambient air entering the water
      making water cooling system flows across an air filter, then a
      precooler heat exchanger (where the air stream is cooled to or
      close to its dew point) and then a water extraction heat
      exchanger, where the air stream is cooled further and water is
      extracted. The water that leaves water extraction heat exchanger
      is collected in a water collection device and passes from there
      through a primary water filter into a water storage tank. The air
      stream then passes across a reheat heat exchanger and exhausted to
      the outside. A water circulation pump extracts water from the
      water storage tank and circulates the water stream through an
      evaporator of a vapor compression refrigeration system, where the
      water stream is chilled, then through the water extraction heat
      exchanger and precooler, where the incoming air stream is chilled
      by removing heat to the water stream. The water stream is then
      circulated through the reheat heat exchanger, where the water
      stream is again cooled by removing heat to the cool dry air
      exiting the water extraction heat exchanger. Finally, the cooled
      water stream is circulated through the water filter to a three way
      valve, which directs water flow either to a dispenser or back to
      the water storage tank.<br>
      <br>
      [0000] There is a number of portable water generating machines
      which may be used outdoors. These portable water generating
      machines employ conventional dehumidifiers for removing water from
      the air for collection into a storage tank. For example U.S.
      Patent Application No. 2007/101862 filed on Nov. 7, 2005 that
      describes a water production unit that uses liquid desiccant and
      vehicle exhaust for extracting water from air.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Another example is the Recovery Unit from Exhaust (WRUE)
      generator that generates water by capturing water from fuel
      expended by engines on the battlefield. To recover potable water
      from engine emissions, water is condensed from exhaust gas and
      then purified using a three-stage filtration process. The portion
      of the exhaust that is unused leaves the vehicle through an
      exhaust port, while the condensed exhaust is collected in the
      water receiver. A water pump then sends the exhaust condensate
      from the water receiver to the water purification subsystem. The
      water now waits to be purified through the use of three separate
      filters; a particle, activated carbon and ion exchange resin. To
      help monitor the life of the filters, sensors are mounted inside
      the crew compartment of the vehicle to let Soldiers when the
      system is in use, and it also allows Soldiers to turn it off when
      it is not needed, see
      www.rdecom.army.mil/rdemagazine/200506/itl_operationH2O.html.<br>
      <br>

      </b><b>DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b>[0110] The present invention, in some embodiments thereof,
      relates to method and device of producing and managing water
      supply and, more particularly, but not exclusively, to method and
      device of producing and managing water supply in vehicles. As used
      herein a vehicle means a car, a track, a train, a boat, an
      airplane, an armored vehicle, such as an armored combat vehicle,
      for example a tank and/or other armored fighting vehicle (AFV),
      military SUV and the like.<br>
      <br>
      [0111] According to an aspect of some embodiments of the present
      invention there is provided system and method of producing and
      managing an air conditioner of a vehicle, according to water
      reservoir and/or water demand and/or supply. The system includes a
      water conducting element set to receive and conduct water
      generated as a product of the vehicle air conditioner to a water
      container. Optionally, the system includes a water treatment unit
      for treating the water. The system further comprises a gauge that
      measures the amount of water in the water container and/or one or
      more sensors having measurements indicative of water consumption,
      water generation status, weather conditions, electricity power
      available and/or available water resources. The system further
      comprises a manager that receives one or more of these
      measurements and instructs an operation of the vehicle air
      conditioner accordingly. Optionally, the manager computes
      instructions according to the measurements, for example current
      weather conditions (temperature, humidity etc.) and estimated
      water shortage and forwards the instructions to the controller of
      the vehicle air conditioner.<br>
      <br>
      [0112] According to an aspect of some embodiments of the present
      invention there is provided device and method of diverting an air
      flow of an air conditioner so that an vehicle air conditioner may
      be used for producing water without undesirably changing the
      temperature in the passenger compartment. The device includes an
      air valve that diverts air flow from an air conditioner of a
      vehicle either toward a passenger compartment of the vehicle or to
      another space, for example a cooling and/or a heating system,
      another compartment, and/or outside the vehicle. Optionally, the
      air valve diverts the air flow toward a system that transfers air
      to cool suits of the passengers. The device includes a sensor that
      detects a temperature in the passenger compartment and a manager
      that controls the air valve during an operation of the vehicle air
      conditioner, according to the temperature. For example, if the
      operator set the desired temperature in the vehicle air
      conditioner to a certain temperature and the vehicle air
      conditioner starts to reduce or to increase the temperature below
      the certain temperature, the manager instructs the air valve to
      direct at least some of the air generated by the vehicle air
      conditioner to the separated space. In such a manner, the vehicle
      air conditioner can still be operated to produce water without
      over cooling and/or overheating the passenger compartment.<br>
      <br>
      [0113] According to an aspect of some embodiments of the present
      invention there is provide device and method of managing a water
      production of water generation units according to the activity of
      a vehicle air conditioner. The device includes and/or controls one
      or more water generation unit that extracts water vapors from an
      ambient air to provide a first amount of water and a water
      treatment unit set to receive and treat this first amount of water
      and a second amount of water from a water outlet of the vehicle
      air conditioner. The device includes an outlet for conducting the
      treated water from the treating unit to a water container. The
      device further includes a manager that instructs an operation of
      the one or more water generation units according to an amount of
      water in the water container and/or the operation mode of the
      vehicle air conditioner.<br>
      <br>
      [0114] According to an aspect of some embodiments of the present
      invention there is provided a device and a method of managing the
      vehicle air conditioner in an operation mode adjusted for low
      temperature, for example a temperature of less than 15[deg.] In
      such an operation mode the cooled air is diverted from the
      passenger compartment to another space, for example to the
      external space in which the vehicle is found and/or usage, the
      cooling output and evaporating temperature is reduced, and/or only
      part of the condenser or the evaporator is used. Such operations
      will reduce the evaporating temperature and allows using a vehicle
      air conditioner not designated to work in a cooling mode when the
      temperature is less than 15[deg.] for producing water.<br>
      <br>
      [0115] Alternatively when the temperature is less than 15[deg.]
      the heating mode will be operated by the passengers and the water
      collection may be performed as shown at FIG. 9A and describe
      below.<br>
      <br>
      [0116] According to some embodiments of the present invention
      there is provided a vehicle integrable device of water production.
      The vehicle integrable device is designed to be integrated into a
      vehicle, such as a armored fighting vehicle (AFV), for example by
      utilizing and/or controlling its power sources, ventilation
      systems, cooling systems, and/or water reservoirs. The device
      includes one or more air pumps and/or blowers, for brevity
      referred to herein as air drawing units, for drawing moist air
      from the passenger compartment of the AFV and/or the surrounding
      of the AFV. The AFV further includes a filtering unit for
      filtering the moist air from organic and inorganic contaminants,
      for example dust, dirt, chemical, biological, radiological, and
      nuclear particles and biomolecules. The device is based on a
      dehumidifying unit that condenses water vapor from the filtered
      moist air. The dehumidifying unit may be based on a desiccant
      wheel, one or more condensers, one or more evaporators, a
      compressor, and/or any other unit that allows dehumidifying air.
      The condensed water vapor may be accumulated in a water container.
      In such a manner, the device allows passengers to spend more time
      in an area without a clean water supply, to convert fuel or
      electricity supply and/or to utilize the air-conditioner and/or
      the engines activity for producing liquid water, for brevity
      referred to herein as water. Optionally, the device's components
      are cased in a harden housing.<br>
      <br>
      [0117] Optionally, the device further comprises one or more water
      filters. In such an embodiment, water may be periodically filtered
      using the one or more water filters. Optionally, the device
      further comprises a UV illumination that allows removing
      contaminants, such as bacteria and/or viruses, such as e-coli,
      cholera, typhoid, anthrax and polio from the water.<br>
      <br>
      [0118] Optionally, the device includes a dirt filter, such as a
      cyclonic filter. In such an embodiment, the device may generate
      water in environmental conditions, such as sand or dirt storms.<br>
      <br>
      [0119] Optionally, the device includes automatic cleaning unit
      that periodically cleans the evaporator, the condenser and/or
      other parts of dust and/or pollutants.<br>
      <br>
      [0120] Optionally, the device includes a water back wash mode that
      cleans the water filter or and act periodically and longer water
      filter life and prevent clogs.<br>
      <br>
      [0121] According to some embodiments of the present invention
      there is provided a method for producing water. The method is
      based on a dehumidifying unit that is integrated into a vehicle,
      as an AFV. The integration may include connecting the
      dehumidifying unit the power battery and/or alternator of the
      vehicle and/or using its cooling and/or ventilation systems. The
      method is further based on drawing, for example by blowing, moist
      air, filtering the moist air, for example as outlined above, and
      condensing the air vapor in the drawn air. The condensed water
      vapor is accumulated in a water container, providing passengers
      and/or vehicle system with an amount of water. Optionally, such a
      water production process is initiated according to the reading of
      one or more sensors, such as electricity power sensor, humidly
      sensor, water accumulation sensors, temperature sensors, and the
      like.<br>
      <br>
      [0122] Before explaining at least one embodiment of the invention
      in detail, it is to be understood that the invention is not
      necessarily limited in its application to the details of
      construction and the arrangement of the components and/or methods
      set forth in the following description and/or illustrated in the
      drawings and/or the Examples. The invention is capable of other
      embodiments or of being practiced or carried out in various ways.<br>
      <br>
      [0123] Reference is now made to FIG. 1, which is a schematic
      illustration of a water management device 100 of managing the
      supply of water generated as a product of an operation of a
      vehicle air conditioner 101, according to some embodiments of the
      present invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0124] The water management device 100 conducts water generated as
      a product of the operation of the vehicle air conditioner 101 to a
      water container 104, and optionally treats it. As used herein, a
      vehicle air conditioner means an air conditioner which is
      integrated with a vehicle, such as a car, an armored fighting
      vehicle (AFV), a military SUV, a train, an aircraft and a
      seacraft. For example, the vehicle air conditioner may be the air
      conditioner used for cooling a passenger compartment. As used
      herein, treating water means filtering undesired particles from
      the water, disinfecting the water, deactivating biological
      substances in water, and/or enriching the water with materials
      such as salts, glucose, sodium, sweetener and/or carbohydrates,
      purifying materials, such as iodine and/or drugs.<br>
      <br>
      [0125] The water management device 100 includes a water inlet 110
      that receives water from the vehicle air conditioner 101 and
      conducts them to a water generation unit 103. In use, the
      conducted water is optionally treated by the water generation unit
      103, for example as the vehicle integrable device that described
      below with reference to FIGS. 8-13 and in Israeli Patent
      Application No. 200680, filed on Sep. 1, 2009, which is provided
      as a priority document and incorporated herein by reference. The
      water treated by the water filtering unit 221 is conducted, via an
      outlet 111, to the water container 104.<br>
      <br>
      [0126] The water management device 100 further includes a manager
      105 that adjusts the operation of the vehicle air conditioner 101
      according to one or more indications, such as water consumption,
      water generation status, water resources, current temperature,
      current amount of available water as further described below.<br>
      <br>
      [0127] Optionally, the manager 105 includes a computing unit such
      as an application specific integrated circuit, optionally with a
      digital signal processing (DSP) core, that computes, according to
      the indications, a set of one or more adjusting instructions for
      the controller of the vehicle air conditioner 101.<br>
      <br>
      [0128] Optionally, the water management device 100 the manager 105
      adjusts the operation of the vehicle air conditioner 101 according
      to the outputs of a temperature sensor for indicating the
      temperature in the passenger compartment and/or around the
      vehicle. Optionally, the water management device 100 adjusts the
      operation of the vehicle air conditioner 101 according to the
      outputs of a hygrometer for indicating a humidly level in the
      passenger compartment and/or around the vehicle. Optionally, the
      manager 105 adjusts the operation of the vehicle air conditioner
      101 according to the time of the year, the time in day, and the
      vehicle geographic location.<br>
      <br>
      [0129] Optionally, the components of the water management device
      100 are housed in a housing designed to absorb shocks, for example
      by using shock absorbers as described below and hardened to
      protect against wear, extreme temperature, chemicals, small arms
      fire and grenades. Optionally, a layer of an alloy, such as
      stainless steel alloy, is used for hardening the housing.
      Optionally, some or all of the passages, in which the drawn air
      pass, are coated with a protective layer, such as a polymeric
      layer. In such a manner, the water vapor is not exposed to metal,
      gases, and/or other toxic materials.<br>
      <br>
      [0130] Optionally, the water management device 100 is powered by a
      power source of the vehicle to which it is integrated, such as the
      battery and/or alternator. Optionally, the power source provides
      an AC current voltage in between 90 and 480 volts between 50 and
      60 hertz or any intermediate value and/or a DC current voltage
      between 12 and 150 volts. Optionally, the water management device
      100 runs at 400 hertz. In such a manner, the power supplies are
      smaller and lighter. This benefit is important as the space in the
      vehicle is limited and it is imperative to minimize weight in
      order to maximize performance. Optionally, the water management
      device 100 is connected to the power source via a commonly used
      military power connection, a vehicle battery, a designated battery
      or any combination thereof. Optionally, the water management
      device 100 comprises an alternator or any other power convertor
      that is connected to the engine's crankshaft. In such an
      embodiment, the power generated by the engine is directly
      converted to facilitate the dehumidification of water vapor.<br>
      <br>
      [0131] According to some embodiments of the present invention, the
      vehicle air conditioner 101 is adjusted for water generation
      usage. In such embodiments, cooling coils, a chamber in which the
      cooling coils are found, water conduits, and/or any element which
      is in touch with the processed air and/or treated water is
      laminated or otherwise covered with a protective layer that
      prevents from the air and/or the treated water to be in touch with
      metal components of the vehicle air conditioner 101. Optionally,
      all the soldering portions are laminated or otherwise covered with
      a protective layer. Optionally, only the soldering portions are
      laminated or otherwise covered with a protective layer.
      Optionally, the surface of the condenser is reduced and one or
      more tray for collecting water is placed below the evaporator,
      and/or the condenser.<br>
      <br>
      [0132] Reference is now also made to FIG. 2A, which is a flowchart
      150 of a method of operating a vehicle air conditioner according
      to water consumption, water generation status, and/or water
      resources, according to some embodiments of the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0133] First, as shown at 151, parameters related to the water
      consumption, the water generation, weather conditions and/or water
      resources in the vehicle are monitored. For example, the amount of
      water in the water container 104 is monitored, optionally in light
      of estimated water consumption determined according to the amount
      of potential consumers, temperature, humidity level and/or time of
      the day.<br>
      <br>
      [0134] Than, as shown at 152, air conditioner instructions are
      computed, for example by the manager 105, for adjusting the
      operation of the vehicle air conditioner 101 according to the
      monitored parameters, for example as described below.<br>
      <br>
      [0135] Now, as shown at 153, the air conditioner instructions are
      forwarded to the vehicle air conditioner 101 so as to allow the
      adjustment of its operation according to the water consumption,
      water generation status, and/or available water resources.<br>
      <br>
      [0136] Optionally, the manager 105 computes air conditioner
      instructions for adjusting the operation of the vehicle air
      conditioner 101 according to one or more inputs from sensors
      and/or other units of the device 100. In such embodiments, the
      manager 105 is electrically connected, wirelessly or with wires,
      to the controller of the vehicle air conditioner 101 and/or
      replaces the controller of the vehicle air conditioner 101. The
      vehicle air conditioner instructions are coded to adjust the
      operation of the vehicle air conditioner 101. For example, the
      instructions are coded to increase the operation of the compressor
      so as to increase the amount of water generated by the vehicle air
      conditioner 101. In another example, the instructions are coded to
      reduce the air supply, reducing the active portion of the
      condenser, diverting some or all of the air away from the
      passenger compartment, gathering water from an external condenser
      when the system is in a heating mode (see FIG. 9A for example),
      and/or using a hot bypass gas to deforest the radiators.<br>
      <br>
      [0137] According to some embodiments of the present invention, the
      manager 105 computes air conditioner instructions according to
      weather condition, for example temperature and/or humidity level.
      For example, if the temperature is relatively low for example
      15[deg.] C. and/or the humidity level is relatively low, for
      example less than 25% RH, the air conditioner instructions adjust
      the operation of the vehicle air conditioner 101 to operate in a
      low air supply mode, for example about a half of the air supply of
      the regular air supply thereof. In such a manner, the evaporation
      temperature is reduced, for example to less than -3[deg.] and the
      water generation throughput increases, for example to more than
      2.0 Liter (Ltr)/Hr.<br>
      <br>
      [0138] For example, if the vehicle air conditioner 101 has a
      cooling output of 14 KW, the temperature is lower than 30[deg.],
      and the humidity level is less than 20% Relative humidity (RH),
      the received evaporation temperature is about 5[deg.] and the
      vehicle air conditioner 101 does not produce much water. However,
      if the air supply is reduced to about a half of the common air
      supply, the received evaporation temperature is about -6[deg.] and
      the water production increases to about 2.5 Ltr per hour (Hr).<br>
      <br>
      [0139] In another example, if the vehicle air conditioner 101 has
      a cooling output of 14 KW, the temperature is lower than 15[deg.],
      and the humidity level is less than 25% Relative humidity (RH),
      the received evaporation temperature is about -1[deg.] and the
      vehicle air conditioner 101 does not produce much water. However,
      if the air supply is reduced to about a half of the common air
      supply, the received evaporation temperature is about -12[deg.]
      and the water production increases to about 1.2 Ltr/Hr.<br>
      <br>
      [0140] According to some embodiments of the present invention, the
      computes air conditioner instructions are computed to increase the
      water production output if the cooling capacity of the vehicle air
      conditioner is higher than a heat load at the passenger
      compartment of the vehicle. As used herein a cooling capacity
      refers to the rate heat is removed from the passenger compartment,
      under weather conditions, for example rated in British Thermal
      Units (BTUs) per hour, or in tons and heat load means the amount
      of heat required to be removed within a certain period, for
      example in BTU or watts. The heat load may be determined by
      measuring the temperature and/or humidity in the passenger
      compartment. The cooling capacity may be provided in advance,
      based on standard weather conditions and/or dynamically changed
      according to up-to-date measurements of respective weather
      sensors. In such embodiments, the manager 105 may communicate with
      the controller of the vehicle air conditioner 101 to receive data
      regarding to the required cooling level and/or the current cooling
      status. Optionally, the manager 105 is connected to a thermometer
      and/or hygrometer which are used to measure the current
      temperature and/or humidity in the passenger compartment and
      optionally to calculate a heat load value. The water production
      output is increased by allocating a portion of the cooling
      capacity for this purpose. For example, the amount of the air from
      the passenger compartment that is recycled by the vehicle air
      conditioner 101 for cooling is reduced or stopped, the amount of
      ambient air that is drawn by the vehicle air conditioner 101 for
      cooling is increased and/or the active surface of the heat
      exchanger of the evaporator of the vehicle air conditioner 101 is
      reduced.<br>
      <br>
      [0141] According to some embodiments of the present invention, the
      computes air conditioner instructions to increase the water
      production output in light of a required cooling level in the
      passenger compartment. In such embodiments, the manager 105 may
      communicate with the controller of the vehicle air conditioner 101
      to receive data regarding to the required cooling level and/or the
      current cooling status.<br>
      <br>
      [0142] Reference is now made to FIG. 2B which is a flowchart of a
      method for instructing the operation of the air conditioner
      according to a required cooling level in the passenger
      compartment, according to some embodiments of the present
      invention. First, as shown at 161, a required cooling level is
      acquired. The required cooling level may be manually set by a
      user, for example using the aforementioned MMI, and/or
      automatically acquired, for example by the manager 105 and/or from
      a memory. Now, as shown at 162, the current cooling level is
      measured and/or acquired, for example from the manager 105.
      Optionally, the manager 105 is connected to a thermometer and/or
      hygrometer which are used to measure the current temperature
      and/or humidity in the passenger compartment and optionally to
      calculate a heat load value. If the measured temperature in below
      the required cooling level, as shown at 163, nothing is done.
      However, if the measured temperature is above the required cooling
      level, as shown at 164, the manager instructs the controller of
      the vehicle air conditioner 101 to change one or more parameters.
      The cooling level is optionally defined according to a heat load
      value, such as heat load temperature and/or humidity. Optionally,
      as shown at 165, the amount of the air from the passenger
      compartment that is recycled by the vehicle air conditioner 101
      for cooling is reduced or stopped. Additionally or alternatively,
      as shown at 166, the amount of ambient air that is drawn by the
      vehicle air conditioner 101 for cooling is increased. Additionally
      or alternatively, as shown at 167, the active surface of the heat
      exchanger of the evaporator of the vehicle air conditioner 101 is
      reduced. It should be noted that the required cooling level may be
      not to cool the passenger compartment at all. In such a case, all
      the throughput of the air conditioner is used for generating
      water. Additionally or alternatively, as shown at 168. one or more
      heating elements may be activated for heating the passenger
      compartment to a required temperature.<br>
      <br>
      [0000] Optionally, the heating elements are activated by the heat
      exchanger of the cooling water of the vehicle. The heating
      elements are activated to balance unnecessary cooling of the
      passenger compartment. In such an embodiment, the air conditioner
      may be operated even when the temperature in the passenger
      compartment is lower than required and/or as required.<br>
      <br>
      [0143] According to some embodiments of the present invention, a
      supplementary evaporator is connected to the cooling gas tubing of
      the vehicle air conditioner 101, optionally in addition to the
      internal evaporator thereof. Optionally, the supplementary
      evaporator directs cooled air away from the passenger compartment.
      The combination of the supplementary evaporator and the compressor
      of the vehicle air conditioner 101, instead or in addition to the
      internal evaporator, allows generating a relatively large amount
      of water in low evaporation temperature and/or relatively low
      humidity level. Alternatively, a set of one or more valves is
      connected to control the heat exchange of the evaporator. The
      valves allow reducing the cooling output of the evaporator by
      changing the effective area thereof, for example to half,
      achieving a similar effect to using the supplementary evaporator.<br>
      <br>
      [0144] For example, if the vehicle air conditioner 101 has a
      cooling output of 14 KW, the temperature is lower than 20[deg.],
      and the humidity level is less than 20% Relative humidity (RH),
      the received evaporation temperature is about 6[deg.] and the
      vehicle air conditioner 101 does not produce much water. However,
      if a supplementary evaporator with about a half cooling output is
      used with the compressor of the vehicle air conditioner 101 or the
      valve reduces the cooling output to half, the received evaporation
      temperature is about -3[deg.] and the water production increases
      to about 3.5 Liter (Ltr) per hour (Hr).<br>
      <br>
      [0145] In another example, the vehicle air conditioner 101 has a
      cooling output of 14 KW, the temperature is lower than 15[deg.],
      and the humidity level is less than 25% Relative humidity (RH),
      the received evaporation temperature is about -1[deg.] and the
      vehicle air conditioner 101 does not produce much water. However,
      if a supplementary evaporator with about a half cooling output is
      used with the compressor of the vehicle air conditioner 101 or the
      valve reduces the cooling output to half, the received evaporation
      temperature is about -10[deg.] and the water production increases
      to about 2.0 Liter (Ltr) per hour (Hr).<br>
      <br>
      [0146] Reference is now also made to FIG. 2C, which is another
      flowchart 220 of a method of operating a vehicle air conditioner
      as shown at FIG. 2A where the method further includes operations
      performed when the vehicle air conditioner in not used for cooling
      and/or heating the passenger compartment, according to some
      embodiments of the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0147] As shown at 221, if the vehicle air conditioner 100 cools
      or heats the passenger compartment, the operation is as described
      in relation to FIG. 2A. Else, as shown at 222, one or more
      parameters are analyzed for determining whether to activate the
      vehicle air conditioner 101 for producing water. For example, the
      parameters may be any one or any combinations of the following:
      the amount of water in the water container 104, the weather
      condition, an estimation about the amount of water generated in
      the current weather condition, the amount energy required for
      generating water in the current weather condition, the amount of
      fuel left in the fuel talk, the amount of consumers in the
      vehicle, the time of the day and the like. These parameters may be
      measured via respective sensors, for example as described below
      and in Israeli Patent Application No. 200680, filed on Sep. 1,
      2009 which is incorporated herein by reference and/or provided
      from a repository that stores these parameters. As shown at 223,
      the parameters allow determining whether to operate the vehicle
      air conditioner 101 or not.<br>
      <br>
      [0148] Optionally, as shown at 224, an air valve is instructed to
      direct the hot and/or cooled air away from the passenger
      compartment, for example as described below in relation to FIG. 5.
      Optionally, as shown at 152-153 and described above, instructions
      for how to operate the vehicle air conditioner 101 are calculated
      and forwarded. Optionally, as shown at 225 a decision to operate
      one or more water generation units is taken based on the
      aforementioned parameters. As shown at 226, this process may be
      iteratively repeated, each time with current parameters and/or
      current air conditioner activity.<br>
      <br>
      [0149] According to some embodiments of the present invention, the
      water management device 100 treats water produced when the vehicle
      air conditioner 101 operates in a heating mode. Optionally, the
      vehicle air conditioner 101 is a reverse cycle air conditioner
      having a reversible refrigeration cycle that produces, when
      reversed, heat instead of cold. When the refrigeration cycle is
      reversed, ambient air is circulated around and condensed on the
      peripheral surface of a cold evaporator that serves as a heat
      exchanger. In such an embodiment, a container is placed below, the
      cold evaporator, gathers the water toward an aperture of a
      drainpipe that carries water generation unit 103. For example, see
      FIG. 9A and the description below.<br>
      <br>
      [0150] Optionally, in use, the manager 105 computes whether the
      vehicle air conditioner 101 produces more water in a refrigeration
      mode or in a heating mode and instructs, accordingly, the
      controller of the vehicle air conditioner 101 to switch between
      them. Optionally, such a switch is performed when the air valve
      directs the hot and/or cooled air away from the passenger
      compartment. For brevity, it should be noted, that each one of the
      embodiments in which a cool air is produced by the vehicle air
      conditioner 101 may be respectively implemented, mutatis mutandis,
      when a hot air is produced by the vehicle air conditioner 101. For
      example, see FIG. 9A and the description below. Optionally, in
      use, the manager 105 is connected to a detector which is set to
      measure the air supply of the vehicle air conditioner 101. In such
      an embodiment, the manager 105 may instruct the controller to
      increase or decrease the power of the blower of the vehicle air
      conditioner 101 until the air supply is as required for producing
      water efficiently and/or economically, for example as described
      herein. In such a manner, dust or dirt which accumulate in the
      filters of the vehicle air conditioner 101 do not substantially
      reduce the water production output,<br>
      <br>
      [0151] Optionally, the manager 105 is connected, wirelessly or
      with wires, to a man machine interface (MMI), such as a keypad, a
      set of buttons, a touch screen, and the like. Optionally, the MMI
      is a remote control that communicates with the manager 105 using a
      wireless interface, such as wireless local area network (WLAN)
      interface, such as WiFi(TM) interface and Bluetooth(TM) interface
      and/or a wired connection, such as a coaxial cable connection. In
      such embodiments, an operator may input instructions for adjusting
      the operation of the vehicle air conditioner 101. Optionally, the
      MMI allows the user both to control the vehicle air conditioner
      101 and to input instructions for adjusting the water generation
      thereof, and optionally of other components of the water
      management device 100. Optionally, the MMI allows the user to
      select among various operation modes, each indicates on different
      water output levels, energy consumption levels, and/or cooling
      levels. Optionally, the MMI allows the user to control the air
      valve described below. Optionally, the MMI is replaces and/or
      includes the control of the vehicle air conditioner 101. When the
      water management device 100 is installed in existing vehicles,
      namely not installed during the initial make-up of the vehicle,
      the MMI is installed, and optionally placed, instead of the
      original control of the vehicle air conditioner 101.<br>
      <br>
      [0152] Optionally, the MMI includes a control that allows an
      operator to switch between various modes, for example two or more
      of the following options air conditioning mode, air conditioning
      mode combined with water generation mode, water generation mode
      only, and water treatment only. The selection of the operator
      determines whether the air switch directs the air flow toward the
      passenger compartment, whether the vehicle air conditioner 101 is
      activated and how, whether the water in the water container are
      circulated and the like. Other operation modes which are
      derivatives of the functionalities described below may also be
      selected by the operator. Optionally, the MMI is connected to
      sensors that monitor the water in the water container 104, for
      example the amount of water in the water container 104 and their
      cleansing level. In such an embodiment, the MMI may present
      respective indications and/or alerts to the operator.<br>
      <br>
      [0153] Optionally, the manager 105 is electrically connected,
      wirelessly or with wires, to a measuring gauge that measures and
      indicates the amount of water in the water container 104.
      Optionally, the measuring gauge uses a float connected to a
      resistor. As the water 104 tank empties, the float drops and
      slides a moving contact along the resistor, changes its
      resistance. Different resistances are indicative of different
      water levels.<br>
      <br>
      [0154] In such embodiments, the manager 105 may adjust the
      operation of the vehicle air conditioner 101 according to the
      different water levels, for example increase or decrease the power
      consumed for the operation.<br>
      <br>
      [0155] Additionally or alternatively, the manager 105 computes the
      vehicle air conditioner instructions according to dynamic
      parameters, such as a variable water consumption according to the
      number of potential water consumers, for example passengers in the
      vehicle, the time of the day, the time of the year, the
      temperature in the passenger compartment, and/or the temperature
      outside of the passenger compartment.<br>
      <br>
      [0156] Additionally or alternatively, the manager 105 computes the
      vehicle air conditioner instructions according to vehicle
      parameters, for example the amount of fuel in the fuel tank, the
      current fuel consumption, the driving mode, and/or any other
      vehicle parameter.<br>
      <br>
      [0157] Reference is now made to FIG. 3A, which is a sectional
      schematic illustration of exemplary components of a water
      treatment unit, such as shown at 103, according to some
      embodiments of the present invention. Optionally, the water
      generation unit 103 includes a water filtering unit 221, for
      example of reverse osmosis (RO) filtering, with a set of water
      filtering components 222-223. Optionally, in use, the water from
      the vehicle air conditioner 101 are conducted toward a membrane
      assembly 222, optionally RO membrane, having a pressure vessel
      that presses the water against the thin film composite membrane,
      such as a spiral-wound membrane and a hollow-fiber membrane. The
      thin film composite membrane traps pollutants and microorganisms
      from the pressed water. Optionally, the filter is a 5 micron water
      filter.<br>
      <br>
      [0000] Optionally, the thin film composite membrane includes one
      or more layers of microfiltration (MF) membranes for rejecting
      suspended particles and high molecular weight compounds,
      ultrafiltration (UF) membranes, and/or nanofiltration (NF)
      membranes for rejecting low molecular weight compounds and ions
      the MF membranes reject. Optionally, the membrane is made from
      cellulose acetate (CA) and/or polyamide thin film composite (TFC).
      Optionally, the one or more membranes remove particles having a
      diameter of more than 0.1 mm. Optionally, the membranes purify
      salt water and water contaminated with CBRN (NBC) agents from the
      water.<br>
      <br>
      [0158] Additionally or alternatively, a silver ions filter that
      releases silver ions in a controlled manner to exchange positive
      ions such as sodium is used. For example, the silver ions filter
      is as defined in OMNIPURE, "K5520-AM filter",
      www.omnipure.com/data_sheets/K/K5520.pdf, which is incorporated
      herein by reference.<br>
      <br>
      [0159] Additionally or alternatively a copper-zinc filter, such as
      a Kinetic Degradation Fluxion (KDF) water filter is used. This
      filter uses a chemical process known as redox oxidation/reduction
      to remove chlorine, lead, mercury, iron, and hydrogen sulfide from
      water supplies. The process also has a mild anti-bacterial,
      algaecitic, and fungicitic, effect and may reduce the accumulation
      of lime scale.<br>
      <br>
      [0160] Additionally or alternatively a pH reducer device is used
      for reducing the pH in the treated water so as to improve mineral
      absorption. Optionally, the pH reducer device includes acid
      neutralizing filters and/or a chemical feed pump system that
      injects a neutralizing solution, also known as pH reducer or
      decreaser. An acid neutralizing filter uses a calcite, iodine
      crystal, and/or calcium carbonate for normal pH correction, but
      could also include a blend of magnesium oxide and calcite, if the
      pH is very low. Since the water absorbs these minerals when it
      passes through the filter, the alkalinity and hardness increase.
      Optionally, the acid neutralizing filters include silver oxide
      and/or silver chloride.<br>
      <br>
      [0161] Optionally, the water filtering unit 221 outlets is
      connected to a mineralizer for adding minerals and/or flavor to
      the treated water. Optionally, the mineralizer is connected to one
      or more mineral sensors which provide indications pertaining to
      the salt level in the water. In such an embodiment, the operation
      of the mineralizer may be triggered or controlled by these
      indications.<br>
      <br>
      [0162] Optionally, the water filtering unit 221 conducts water via
      one or more sediment filters 223A, such as fiber rolls or wattles,
      each configured for trapping particles having a diameter over a
      certain threshold before arriving at the membrane assembly 222.
      Optionally, the first sediment filter is used for capturing
      particles having a diameter of more than 5 mm and a second
      sediment filter is used for capturing particles having a diameter
      of more than 3 mm and so on and so forth. Optionally, the diameter
      of the captured particles is determined according to the size of
      the pores of the sediment filters. Optionally, the water filtering
      unit 221 removes filtered particles via a drain.<br>
      <br>
      [0163] Additionally or alternatively, the water filtering unit 221
      further conducts the water via an activated carbon filter 223B
      that traps organic chemicals, such as herbicides and pesticides,
      and may also remove objectionable tastes and odors, before
      arriving at the membrane assembly 222.<br>
      <br>
      [0164] Additionally or alternatively, the water filtering unit 221
      further includes a carbon filter (not shown) that is placed to
      trap chemicals which are not removed by the RO membrane.<br>
      <br>
      [0165] Additionally or alternatively, the water filtering unit 221
      conducts the water in front of a ultra-violet lamp 224 for
      disinfecting microbes which are not removed by the RO membrane.
      Optionally, the UV illumination is concentrated in the 254
      nanometers (nm) region so as to allow removing some or all of the
      bacteria and/or viruses, such as e-coli, cholera, typhoid, anthrax
      and polio in the water.<br>
      <br>
      [0000] Optionally, the ultra-violet lamp 224 is housed in an
      ultraviolet disinfection sterilizer tube, such the UV bulb of
      TAMI(TM) that the specification thereof is incorporated herein by
      reference. The tube is energized by embedded ballast having a
      power supply of 12 VDC, 1.8ADC. The supply is done by a
      switch-mode power supply SMPS-DC/DC converter from 24VDC to 12VDC,
      25 W, for example MEAN WELL, "25 W Single Output DC-DC Converter,
      PN SD-25B-12 (24VDC/12VDC, 2.1 A, 25 W) which the specification
      thereof is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
      <br>
      [0166] Reference is now made to FIG. 3B, which is a schematic
      illustration of an exemplary water generation unit 103, according
      to some embodiments of the present invention. The water generation
      unit 103 includes a water inlet 2 for receiving water from the
      vehicle air conditioner, and optionally from one or more water
      generation units, and a treat water output 1, such as a water
      collection tray, optionally detachable. The water from the tray is
      conducted to a water container 3, such as 104. Dotted line 4
      depicts optional separation between the water container 3 and the
      water generation unit 103. Numerals 5-10 depict various coupling
      fluid connections that allows detachably connecting and releasing
      the tray 1 and the water container 3. Numeral 18 depicts
      electrically motorized diaphragm pump. Numeral 17 depicts a mesh
      filter that filters dirt from reaching the pump 18. The pump 18
      drives the water in the water generation unit 103. The pump 18
      pumps water originated from the vehicle air conditioner 101 and/or
      other water generation units from the collection tray 1. Numerals
      11-16 depict various fluid valves that allow receiving or
      rejecting water from the vehicle air conditioner 101 and/or other
      water generation units. The pumped water passes via a water
      presence detection tube 19 that detects water by a water presence
      detector capacitive proximity sensor 21. Then, the water flows
      through a water quality improvement filter(s) 23, such as one or
      more of the aforementioned filters. Water leaving the filter(s) 23
      flow through a pressure regulator 24 that regulates the water
      pressure to a predetermined value suitable for use. Water flows
      from the pressure regulator 24, for example the Pressure regulator
      of CAMOZZI, PN: M004-R00, which the specification thereof is
      incorporated herein by reference, to the water reservoir tank 3
      and/or out for use, via a pouring nozzle 28. Numeral 20 depicts a
      water presence detection tube for monitoring water in the water
      container and numeral 22 depicts water presence detection
      capacitive proximity sensor for monitoring water in the water
      container. Numeral 25 depicts a heat exchange water cooling
      element which cools the water by conducting refrigerant gas.
      Numerals 26-27 depict heat exchange refrigerant gas entries.
      Numeral 27 depicts a flow restrictor.<br>
      <br>
      [0167] Optionally, the water generation unit 103 is adapted to
      operate also when the vehicle is inclined, for example in 15
      degrees relative to the horizon or more, for example 20 degrees or
      even in 45 degrees relative to the horizon, in order to enable
      withdrawal of the water when the vehicle is diagonally oriented.
      Optionally, water is alternately withdrawn through both the left
      and the right connections 5, 6 which are placed in the left and
      the right low side of the tray 1. In such a manner, water from one
      of the sides of the tray 1 is pumped. If water is not present at
      any side air is pumped. This process is done periodically, with
      predetermined period, base on calculation of water extraction
      throughput. Optionally, valves which are connected to an angle
      sensor open and close the connections 5, 6. When air is pumped
      instead of water, for example when the vehicle air conditioner 101
      stops and water is no longer sensed by the sensor 21, the pump 18
      is put on hold or shut down by the manager 105 or any other
      controller, referred to herein, for brevity, the manager 105.
      Water pumped from water container 3 flows through quick coupling
      fluid connection 8 then through solenoid valve SV4 14 and via
      filter 17 by the pump 18. In such a manner, the water in the water
      container 3 are cycled, similarly to the described below. Water
      pumped to the water container 3 pass via the pressure regulator
      24, the solenoid valve 15, and the quick coupling fluid connection
      9. Optionally, air pressure may be released from the water
      container 3 so as to allow the filling thereof with water. The air
      pressure release is done via quick coupling fluid connection 10,
      water presence detection tube 20 and emitted from tube 20 outlet.
      When the tank water container 3 is filled-up water overflows
      through the air pressure released path. When water reaches capsule
      20 it is detected by the water presence detector capacitive
      proximity sensor 22 and a signal therefrom is forwarded to the
      manager 105 that shuts the pump 18 down. Optionally, the spilled
      water is routed to the tray 1.<br>
      <br>
      [0168] Reference is now also made to FIG. 3C, which is a schematic
      illustration of a means of pumping water from a tray or a
      container inclined in relation to the horizon, according to some
      embodiments of the present invention. As outlined above, the water
      generation unit 103 may be adapted to operate when the vehicle is
      inclined. Optionally, the water generation unit 103 uses a
      mechanism for facilitating such pumping, for example the means
      depicted in FIG. 3C.<br>
      <br>
      [0169] Using such a mechanism allows drawing water from the water
      container even when it is relatively empty, for example when the
      water level is shorter than the width of a water container. FIG.
      3C depicts a water container 901, such as the water container 104
      depicted in FIG. 1, or a tray, such as the trays 73 74 in FIG. 9A.
      The water container 901 has apertures in at least two of its lower
      left, lower right, optionally upper left, and upper right corners.
      It should be noted that even though FIG. 3C depicts a water
      container with a rectangular base, the water container 901 may be
      conical, cubical, spherical, cylindrical, triangular, tetrahedral
      star-like, or pyramid in shape. The corners are respectively
      selected so that water is inclined toward it when the vehicle is
      inclined to its left and/or right sides. For example, eight
      apertures are set in corners 902-909, 4 of them 902-905 at the top
      of the water container 901 and 4 others 906-909 at its bottom. The
      corners 902-909 are optionally at the endmost corners in relation
      to the center of the water container 901.<br>
      <br>
      [0170] At each of the corners 902-909, a tubing connection is made
      and a tube is drawn to the water generation unit 103. Each tube is
      connected to a corresponding solenoid valve, for example the
      solenoid valves depicted in FIG. 3B. The top tubes are connected
      to solenoid valves 910-913 and bottom tubes are connected are
      connected to solenoid valves 914-917. The solenoid valves, which
      are optionally as described in relation to FIG. 3B, are controlled
      by the manager 105 so that drawing may be performed from one or
      more of the top connections 902-905 and/or one or more of the
      bottom connections 906-909. Optionally, the valves are controlled
      according to a predetermined scheme, for example left-right,
      left-right and the like. In such an embodiment no sensor may be
      used. In other embodiments, the control is determined according to
      readings of various sensors, for example as outlined above and
      described below. The selected connection(s) from the top group 918
      and/or the selected connection(s) from the bottom group 919 are
      used to withdraw water from the water container 901, and
      optionally to circulate them via the water generation unit 103.
      The mechanism depicted in FIG. 10 does not require using a
      dedicated pressure release connection. When filling or withdrawing
      water, the bottom connection(s) are used via tube 919 and pressure
      release is done via the top connection(s) and tube 918. Additional
      valves (not shown) may by placed along tubes 918 and 919 for
      facilitating the pressure realize in a controllable manner. The
      circulation of water via tube 919 and tube 918, for example as
      described above, does not require pressure release.<br>
      <br>
      [0171] Optionally, the manager 105 selects the connections, in
      real time, according to readings of fluid sensors located in the
      water container, for example at the highest and lowest corners of
      the water container. Optionally, the manager 105 selects the
      connections in real time according to readings of an inclinometer.
      If the vehicle is in motion, acceleration waves of the water in
      the water container 901 are taken into account. Such indications
      may be measured by an accelerometer or the like. The combination
      of the accelerations and the inclining of the vehicle indicate
      from which corners water is drawn when the vehicle is in motion
      and/or stationary. Optionally, the inclinometer and accelerometer
      are at the same orientation of the vehicle. Optionally, the
      mechanism described in FIG. 3C is used for the collection of water
      from the water container 901 and/or from the water collection tray
      73, 74 described below in relation to FIG. 9A.<br>
      <br>
      [0172] Optionally, the water container 901, which may be as the
      water container 104 or as one of the trays 73 74 in FIG. 9A is
      opaque so as to prevent microorganism contamination.<br>
      <br>
      [0173] Reference is now made, once again, to FIG. 1. As described
      above, the water treated by the water filtering unit 221 is
      conducted, via the outlet 111, to the water container 104.<br>
      <br>
      [0174] According to some embodiments of the present invention, the
      water container 104 receives water from additional sources which
      are located in and/or on the vehicle, for example from water
      generation units, a water inlet, and/or rain water collecting
      system. The water container 104 may be external to the water
      management device 100, for example the water container 104 of an
      armored fighting vehicle (AFV), an airplane, a train and the like.
      The water container 104 may be an integral part of the water
      management device 100.<br>
      <br>
      [0175] Optionally, as shown at 112, water from the water container
      104 may be re-conducted via the water treatment unit 104.
      Optionally, the water in the water container 104 is periodically,
      randomly, and/or continuously circulated via the water treatment
      unit 104. In such a manner, water in the water container is
      treated even if it is not a product of the vehicle air conditioner
      101 and/or not recently collected. Optionally, the water in the
      water container 109 are circulated via the water treatment unit
      104 according to the outputs of one or more water quality sensors,
      such as dissolved oxygen, pH, turbidity, temperature, and salinity
      sensors, passed via the water treatment unit 104. In such an
      embodiment, a pump 113, such as a booster pump, is used for
      circulating the water from the water container 104 via the water
      treatment unit 104. A periodic circulation of the water in the
      water treatment unit 104 via the water treatment unit 104
      maintains the purity level of the water and prevents the growth of
      algae, bacterial plaque and/or biofilms in the water container
      104.<br>
      <br>
      [0176] Optionally, the water container 104 has a tap that allows
      passengers to drink or otherwise use the contained water. It
      should be noted that as the water is a product of the operation of
      the vehicle air conditioner 101 there temperature is relatively
      low. Optionally, the water container 104 comprises a number of
      separated water cells.<br>
      <br>
      [0177] According to some embodiments of the present invention, the
      water generation unit 103 enriches the water produced by the
      vehicle air conditioner 101. Reference is now also made to FIG. 4,
      which is a schematic illustration of an enrichment unit 401 which
      is integrated with the water generation unit 103, for example as a
      unit which added to the outlet of the filtering unit depicted in
      FIG. 3A, according to some embodiments of the present invention.
      The enrichment unit 401 allows enriching the water, for example by
      converting them to isotonic water and/or energy water and/or
      sports water. Optionally, the water is enriched with enrichment
      materials such as salts, glucose, sodium, sweetener and/or
      carbohydrates, purifying materials, such as iodine and/or drugs.
      Optionally, the enrichment unit 401 manages a battery 402 of
      enriching tablets, powder and/or liquid. In use, the enrichment
      unit 401 releases one or more enriching tablets and/or powder
      and/or liquid periodically, randomly, and/or continuously and/or
      according to the output of a water quality sensor and/or according
      to the to the quantity of water in the water container 109.
      Optionally, the tablet is released by an electronic lever 404.
      Optionally, the enrichment unit 401 is controlled by the
      controller 106 and/or activated manually, for example by a push
      button 403. Optionally, the tablet, the powder, and/or the liquid
      are released using a solenoid valve 403. Optionally, the
      enrichment unit 401 is designed to release different enrichment
      ingredients in response to different triggers and/or needs.
      Optionally, the enrichment unit 401 is connected to a designated
      portion 405 in a duct that connects the water inlet 104 from the
      vehicle air conditioner 101 to the water container 104. An
      exemplary composition of a tablet has the following notorious
      value per unit: 140 Energy kcals, 33 g Carbohydrate, fat, 235 mg
      sodium, 4.8 mg Potassium, 3.05 mg Niacin, 1.02 mg Antithetic acid,
      1.7 mg Vitamin B6, and 0.85 Vitamin B12. Optionally, the tablet,
      the powder, and/or the liquid are used for sterilizing the water,
      for example by adding sterilizing agents to the water, for example
      Highly-Soluble Chlorinated Sanitize. Optionally, the sterilizing
      agents are released to enrich water which is used to clean the
      system, for example as described above.<br>
      <br>
      [0178] Reference is now made to FIG. 5, which is a schematic
      illustration of a device 400 of managing an operation of an air
      valve 421, according to some embodiments of the present invention.
      In FIG. 5, the device 400 is similar to water management device
      100 depicted in FIG. 1, however, the manager 105 controls an air
      valve that directs cooled air from the vehicle air conditioner
      101. As described above, the water management device 100, 400
      manages the supply of treated water generated as a product of the
      operation of the vehicle air conditioner 101. However, as the
      vehicle air conditioner 101 also cools the passenger compartment,
      operating the vehicle air conditioner 101 for providing water may
      have an undesirable affect of cooling and/or overcooling the
      passenger compartment and/or wasting the cooled air. In order to
      avoid such cooling and/or overcooling, the manager 105 may control
      the air valve 421 that optionally directs cooled air from vehicle
      air conditioner 101. The air valve 421 may direct the cooled air
      toward the passenger compartment and/or toward another space, for
      example another compartment vehicle and/or the space outside the
      vehicle. Optionally, the air valve diverts 421 the air flow toward
      a system that transfers cool air to air conditioned suits of the
      passengers, for example air-cooled vest, air cooled overall,
      and/or air cooled CBRN (NBC) overall. Optionally, the air valve
      421 placed in a T-junction of a system of air tubes that conducts
      the air from the vehicle air conditioner 101. One side of the
      T-junction leads toward the passenger compartment and the other
      side leads toward outside the vehicle and/or toward another
      compartment and/or cooling system. The air valve 421 may be any
      directional control valve. Optionally, the air valve 421 directs
      the cool air toward a cooling system that is sized and shaped to
      cool the water container 104. In such an embodiment, the cold air
      may be circulated in one or more pipes that circumvent the water
      container 104. The cooled air reduces and/or maintains the
      temperature of the treated water in a relatively low temperature.
      Optionally, the cooled air is used for cooling one of the cells in
      the water container 104. In such a manner, the water container 104
      is used for providing water in different temperatures.<br>
      <br>
      [0179] Reference is now made to FIG. 6, which is a schematic
      illustration of a water treatment device 500 of managing an
      operation of a vehicle air conditioner 101 and one or more
      additional water sources, according to some embodiments of the
      present invention. The water treatment device 500 is similar to
      water management device 100 depicted in FIG. 1; however in FIG. 5
      the water treatment device 500 is connected via one or more water
      conducting tubes to one or more water generation unit 103.
      Optionally, each water generation unit 103 is defined as described
      below with reference to FIG. 8-13 and/or in Israeli Patent
      Application No. 200680, filed on Sep. 1, 2009 which is
      incorporated herein by reference. For example, one or more of the
      water generation units uses a dehumidifying unit based on a
      desiccant wheel, one or more condensers, one or more evaporators,
      a compressor, and/or any other unit that allows dehumidifying air.
      As described above, the water treatment device 500 treats water
      generated as a product of the operation of a vehicle air
      conditioner, as shown at 101. In order to provide treated water
      when the vehicle air conditioner 101 is inoperative and/or to
      increase the amount of treated water which are generated by the
      device, for example when the vehicle air conditioner does not
      generate sufficient water, one or more water generation units are
      connected to the device 105. The one or more water generation
      water may be external, optionally independent, units. The one or
      more water generation unit 107 may be integral units of the water
      treatment device 500.<br>
      <br>
      [0180] In such embodiments, the manager 105 is electrically
      connected, wirelessly or with wires, to the controller of the one
      or more water generation unit 103 and/or replaces the controller
      of the one or more water generation unit 103. Similarly to the
      described above, the manager 105 may control the one or more water
      generation unit 103 according to water consumption, water
      generation status, water resources, and/or according to the
      operation of the vehicle air conditioner 101.<br>
      <br>
      [0181] According to some embodiments of the present invention, the
      water generation unit(s) 107 and the vehicle air conditioner 101
      shares units, such as the dehumidifying unit and/or power sources.
      In such an embodiment, the water generation unit(s) 107 and the
      vehicle air conditioner 101 may be alternately operated, according
      to the operator selection and/or measurements, such as
      temperature, humidity level, amount of water in the water
      container 104 and the like.<br>
      <br>
      [0182] Reference is now made to FIG. 9A, which is an exemplary
      arrangement in which two radiators are interchangeably used
      condensers and/or evaporators, according to some embodiments of
      the present embodiment.<br>
      <br>
      [0183] In a first arrangement, for example when the air
      conditioner is in a cooling mode, a first radiator 72, which is
      optionally external to the air conditioner, is used as a condenser
      and a second radiator 71, which is optionally an internal unit of
      the air conditioner, is used as an evaporator. In such an
      embodiment, water is collected by water collection tray 73.<br>
      <br>
      In the second arrangement, for example when the air conditioner is
      in a heating mode, the second radiator 71 acts as a condenser and
      the first radiator 72 acts as an evaporator. In such an
      embodiment, water is collected by water collection tray 74. Water
      collected at tray 73 is drained via drainage tubes 75, 76 into a
      water collection buffer container 77. If possible water is moved
      by gravitation and/or a pump.<br>
      <br>
      [0185] The arrangement depicted in FIG. 9A allows collecting water
      produced from an operation of the vehicle air container 101 in a
      heating mode and in a cooling mode.<br>
      <br>
      [0186] Reference is now made to FIG. 8, which is a schematic
      illustration of a water generation unit, referred to herein as
      vehicle integrable device 1100, for producing water from air, such
      as ambient air, according to some embodiments of the present
      invention. This water generation unit 1100 may be part of the
      water management device 100 which is described above, for example
      in FIG. 8 a standalone unit and/or to other units as described
      below. Optionally, the water outlet 1104 is connected to a water
      container 1109, optionally in a detachable manner. In such an
      embodiment, the condensed water vapor is accumulated in the water
      container 1109. Optionally, the water container 1109 has a faucet
      that is connected thereto and/or one or more conducting elements,
      such as tubes, for conducting the accumulated water toward a
      faucet in and/or on the vehicle.<br>
      <br>
      [0187] The vehicle integrable device 1100 includes a dehumidifying
      unit 1105 for condensing water vapor from air that is drawn
      therethrough. The dehumidifying unit 1105 has an air inlet 1101
      from which the ambient air is drawn, an air outlet 1103 for
      extracting dehumidified air, and optionally a water outlet 1104
      for extracting condensed water vapor. The housing 1130 is designed
      to be mounted in a vehicle, which is optionally an AFV, such as a
      tank, an armored personnel carrier, a small four-wheel-drive
      military vehicle, and an all-terrain vehicle. The housing 1130 is
      designed to absorb shocks, for example by using shock absorbers as
      described below and hardened to protect against wear, extreme
      temperature, chemicals, small arms fire and grenades. Optionally,
      a layer of an alloy, such as stainless steel alloy, is used for
      hardening the housing. Optionally, some or all of the passages, in
      which the drawn air pass, are coated with a protective layer, such
      as a polymeric layer. In such a manner, the water vapor is not
      exposed to metal, gases, and/or other toxic materials.<br>
      <br>
      [0188] The vehicle integrable device 1100 is powered by a power
      source of the vehicle to which it is integrated, for example as
      described below, such as the battery and/or alternator.
      Optionally, the power source provides an AC current voltage in
      between 90 and 480 volts between 50 and 60 hertz or any
      intermediate value and/or a DC current voltage between 12 and 150
      volts. Optionally, the vehicle integrable device 1100 runs at 400
      hertz. In such a manner, the power supplies are smaller and
      lighter. This benefit is important as the space in the vehicle is
      limited and it is imperative to minimize weight in order to
      maximize performance. Optionally, the vehicle integrable device
      1100 is connected to the power source via a commonly used military
      power connection, a vehicle battery, a designated battery or any
      combination thereof. Optionally, the vehicle integrable device
      1100 comprises an alternator or any other power convertor that is
      connected to the engine's crankshaft. In such an embodiment, the
      power generated by the engine is directly converted to facilitate
      the dehumidification of water vapor.<br>
      <br>
      [0189] Optionally, the dehumidifying unit 1105 is controlled by a
      controller 1107, such as a microcontroller or microprocessor. The
      controller is optionally connected to the aforementioned MMI
      and/or to MMI 1108, for example a keypad and/or a display, for
      allowing the use to operate the vehicle integrable device 1100
      and/or to display the operational mode of the vehicle integrable
      device 1100 and/or the estimated water production thereof.
      Optionally, the MMI is a remote control that communicates with the
      controller using a wireless interface, such as wireless local area
      network (WLAN) interface, such as Wi-Fi(TM) interface and
      Bluetooth(TM) interface and/or a wired connection, such as a
      coaxial cable connection. The MMI 1108 optionally includes a
      display, such as a liquid crystal display (LCD) that allows
      presenting data pertaining to the air condensing process and/or
      gallons or liters that the unit produce and/or relative data like
      temperature and humidity and/or electrical consumption and/or CBRN
      (NBC) alerting and/or user alerting like parts failure and service
      requirements and/or water parameters like ORP and/or TDS and/or PH
      level and/or more parameters that give indication of the water
      condition In such an embodiment, the MMI 1108 may be attached to
      the dashboard of the vehicle and/or to any other accessible
      location in the passenger compartment.<br>
      <br>
      [0190] According to some embodiments of the present invention, the
      vehicle integrable device 1100 utilizes air pressure which is
      generated by one or more of the units of the vehicle. Optionally,
      the condenser 1154 is directly connected to the air pressure
      system of the vehicle.<br>
      <br>
      [0000] In such a manner, less electric power is needed for the
      water production process. Optionally, the controller 1107 controls
      one or more valves which regulate the air pressure which is
      received from the vehicle units. Optionally, the controller is
      connected to one or more sensors that allow evaluating the air
      pressure which is available for powering the condenser.<br>
      <br>
      [0191] Optionally, the dehumidifying unit 1105 uses the cooling
      system of the vehicle. In such an embodiment, the compressor, the
      condenser, and/or the evaporator of the cooling system are
      controlled by the dehumidifying unit 1105.<br>
      <br>
      [0192] Optionally, the components of the cooling system are
      adapted for water production. For example, the passages may be
      coated with a polymer and/or any other material that isolates the
      water vapor and/or the generated water from metals, gas, and/or
      other toxic materials. As further described below, the produced
      water may be treated by a cleaning unit, such as a reverse osmosis
      unit, and/or enriched various agents so as to facilitate the
      drinking thereof.<br>
      <br>
      [0193] Additionally or alternatively, the condensed water vapor,
      which is generated by the cooling system of the vehicle, is
      conducted toward the water container 1109. In such an embodiment,
      the activation and/or deactivation of the vehicle integrable
      device 1100 may depend on the amount of water produced as an
      outcome of the operation of the cooling system.<br>
      <br>
      [0194] Reference is now also made to FIG. 9A which is a schematic
      illustration of an exemplary dehumidifying unit 1105, according to
      some embodiments of the present invention. It should be noted that
      other dehumidifying units may be used. The dehumidifying unit 1105
      has an air inlet 1150 for facilitating the passage of air
      therethrough. The air is motivated by an air drawing unit, such as
      a fan 1153. The motivated air from the air inlet 1150 passes via a
      hot coil condenser 1154, a heat element 1155, a desiccant wheel
      1156 that is rotated by a motor, and a cold coil evaporator 1158.
      In use, the hot coil condenser 1154 and the heat element 1155 warm
      the air. The desiccant wheel 1156 turns, the desiccant passes
      alternately through the incoming air where the water vapor are
      adsorbed and through a regenerating zone where the desiccant is
      dried and the adsorbed water vapor are carried through a drain
      toward the water container 1109. As long as the wheel rotates and
      the air flow therethrough, the adsorbent process continues.<br>
      <br>
      [0195] The cold coil evaporator 1158 cools the air that is than
      drawn from the dehumidifying unit 1105, towards the air outlet
      1103. The cold coil evaporator 1158 condenses moisture which is
      discharged from the desiccant wheel 1156 on the outside of the
      coils and is carries it through a drain toward the water container
      1109.<br>
      <br>
      [0196] Optionally, the suction that is applied by the fan 1153 is
      adjusted according to the air passability level of the filtering
      unit 1106. If the air passability level of the filters is low, for
      example as an outcome of a blockage, dirt, and/or trapped
      particles, the suction increases. If the air passability level of
      the filters is high, the suction decreases. Optionally, the
      cleaning unit is activated according to an estimation of the air
      passability level. Optionally, the air passability level is
      evaluated by measuring the air flow in response to the pressure
      applied by the fan 1153.<br>
      <br>
      [0197] Optionally, an additional fan 1160 is used for drawing air
      from another inlet 1159 which is optionally connected to another
      space. For example, while one of the air inlets 1150, 1159 is
      connected, for example via an air duct, to the passenger
      comportment of the vehicle, the other inlet 1150, 1159 is
      connected, for example via another air duct, to an aperture to an
      ambient air that surrounds the vehicle. Optionally, the fans are
      operated simultaneously and/or alternatively, optionally according
      to hygrometers which are located in the space from which the air
      is drawn. Optionally, the cold coil evaporator 1158 and the hot
      condenser coil 1154 are separately circulated with air, for
      example each by a separate fan.<br>
      <br>
      [0198] According to some embodiments of the present invention, a
      pre-cooling device is used for cooling the air which is blown
      in-front of the evaporator 1158, which may be referred to as
      cooling coils. In such an embodiment, the humid air from which
      water are extracted is cooled down before and/or during the
      circulation thereof around the cooling coils. This increases the
      throughput of the dehumidifying unit 1105. Optionally, the pre
      cooling device comprising an air to air heat exchanger, such as a
      plate or a rotary wheel, which is placed to be in contact with
      humid air conducted toward the evaporator 1158 and one or more
      ducts, optionally semi circular, which are placed to conduct air
      that has been circulated around the cooling coils toward the heat
      exchanger. The cold dry air from the evaporator 1158 allows the
      heat exchanger to cool down the humid air that is conducted toward
      the evaporator 1158 by heat transfer. FIG. 9B schematically
      depicts such an arrangement when air to air exchanger plate 1999
      is used to reduce temperature and semi circular duct 1998 is used
      to cycle cold air toward the air exchanger plate 1999. Optionally,
      as shown at FIG. 9B, the air is conducted in front of the
      evaporator 1158 twice. FIG. 9C schematically depicts such an
      arrangement when a rotary wheel 1997 is used as a heat exchanger
      for cooling the air that is conducted toward the cooling coils.
      FIG. 9D is schematic illustration of a pre cooling arrangement
      where two heat exchangers are used, each mounted in proximity to
      opposing sides of the evaporator 1158. This arrangement may be
      used when two opposing inlets and outlets are used. FIG. 9E is
      schematic illustration of a fin based pre cooling arrangement. In
      this arrangement heat exchanger fins 2000 circulated the air a
      plurality of times in front of the evaporator 1158 in a plurality
      of conduits 2001. Valves 2002 may be used to direct the dry air
      from one conduit to another.<br>
      <br>
      [0199] Optionally, a pre cooling arrangement includes a liquid
      based heat exchanger 2010 for liquid-to-liquid heat transfer. In
      this embodiment, the heat exchanger surrounds the evaporator 1158,
      for example as shown at FIGS. 9F and 9G. In these figures, the
      left portion 2011 of the liquid based heat exchanger is cooled
      down by the air that passes in front of the evaporator 1158. This
      allows reducing the temperature of the right portion 2012 of the
      liquid based heat exchanger by liquid-to-liquid heat transfer. The
      reduction of the temperature at the right portion 2012 cools down
      the air before it is conducted in front of the evaporator 1158. A
      pump 2013 is used to circulate the liquid in the liquid based heat
      exchanger 2010.<br>
      <br>
      [0200] According to some embodiments of the present invention, the
      cooled air which is passed in front of the evaporator 1158 is
      conducted toward the condenser 1154, reducing the temperature of
      the air around it. In such a manner, the temperature of the air
      that surrounds the condenser 1154 is reduced and therefore the
      throughput of the condenser 1154 is increased. Optionally, the
      condenser 1154 is divided to a pre cooled section and a heating
      section. The air from the evaporator 1158 is drawn to cool down
      the pre cooled section and ambient air is drawn to cool down the
      heat section. In such a manner, the temperature of the coolant in
      the condenser 1154 is reduced when it passes from the heating
      section to the pre cooling section, before being conducted toward
      the evaporator. In such a manner, the efficiency of the
      condenser-evaporator cycle is increased.<br>
      <br>
      [0201] According to some embodiments of the present invention, one
      or more a compressor engine, for example 1162 and the blower which
      draws air therearound. The controller 1107 operates the compressor
      and blower, for example by voltage supply. At a standard mode, the
      compressor and blower operate at a capacity which is adapted to
      the weather conditions, for example in a partial capacity. For
      example, when the ambient temperature is 25[deg.] C. and the RH is
      55%, the compressor cooling capacity is 2700 Watt and the blower
      is operated at an air delivery of about 350 CM/H with water
      production of about 1.0 Lit/Hr. At a maximum water production
      mode, the compressor and blower may be operate at a higher
      capacity. For example, when the ambient temperature is 25[deg.] C.
      and the RH is 55%, the cooling capacity of the compressor is 4900
      Watts and the blower operates in an air delivery capacity of 600
      CM/H and water production: of about 1.6 Lit/Hr.<br>
      <br>
      [0202] According to some embodiments of the present invention, the
      vehicle integrable device 1100 comprises an air filtering unit
      1106 for filtering the air that is drawn via the air inlet 1101.
      Optionally, the air filtering unit 1106 is a high efficiency
      particulate air (HEPA) filter that remove at least 99.97% of
      airborne and/or aerosol particles 0.3 micrometers ([mu]m) in
      diameter.<br>
      <br>
      [0203] According to some embodiments of the present invention, the
      vehicle integrable device 1100 is cooled by a gas based cooling
      system. Optionally, the cooling gas is CO2.<br>
      <br>
      [0204] Reference is now also made to FIG. 10, which is a sectional
      schematic illustration of the vehicle integrable device 1100 with
      a HEPA air filtering unit 1106, according to some embodiments of
      the present invention. The vehicle integrable device 1100 is as
      described in FIG. 8 and having the hot coil condenser 1154, the
      cold coil evaporator 1158, the fan 1153, and the water container
      1109, are as described above. FIG. 10 further depicts a number of
      filters 1204-1206 of the air filtering unit 1106. In use, the
      filters 1204-1206 are used for filtering the air that is drawn via
      the air inlet 1101. As depicted in FIG. 10, the air filtering unit

      FIG. 10, one or more micro fiber filter 1204, an activated carbon
      filter 1205, and a charcoal dust filter 1206 are loaded in the
      chamber 201. Such a combination may be collectively referred to as
      a chemical, biological, radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) filter
      and/or a nuclear, biological, chemical (NBC) filter. For clarity,
      any combination of filters or other NBC (CBRN) cleaning
      technologies may be inserted into the chamber. Optionally, the
      chamber 1201 is sealed with a layer of silicon sealing and/or CBRN
      rubber, such as butyl rubber, Polylsoprene rubber and/or Neoprene
      rubber.<br>
      <br>
      [0205] Additionally or alternatively, the air filtering unit 1106
      is modular. In such an embodiment, the chamber 1201 allows using
      filters 1204-1206 in a modular manner. In such an embodiment, any
      combination of filters may be used. In use, the operator may
      replace the filters according to changes in the threats and/or
      environmental conditions. For example, is a certain chemical
      contamination may be found in the space that surrounds the
      vehicle, the operator may add a chemical filter. Else, the use
      will remove the chemical filter in order to prolong filter life.<br>

      has a plurality of air passages and one or more valves for
      directing air via one or more selected air passages from a
      selected group from the plurality of air passages. Optionally, the
      one or more valves are controlled by the controller 1107. In such
      an embodiment, different air passages may be selected for drawing
      ambient air in different situations. For example, while one pass
      draws air via dirt filters, others draw the ambient air via CBRN
      (NBC) filters. Optionally, the alternative air passages are
      arranged to allow bypassing each one of a plurality of filters
      separately and/or simultaneously. For example, the air may be
      separately or jointly drawn via a micro fiber filter, an activated
      carbon filter, and a charcoal dust filter. Optionally, the air
      passages are manually selected according to the MMI 1108 outputs.
      Optionally, the air passages are automatically selected according
      to the controller 1107, optionally according to the reading of
      related sensors, such as CBRN (NBC) sensors and/or CBRN (NBC)
      modes.<br>
      <br>
      [0000] The filter replacement is facilitated by opening the cover
      1203, for example using the handle 1209. Optionally, the opening
      of the cover automatically deactivate the operation of the vehicle
      integrable device 1100 and/or triggers a standby mode. Optionally,
      the deactivation is performed when a button that is pressed by the
      cover 1203 is released. In such a manner, to water production is
      stopped and a contamination by unfiltered air is avoided.<br>

      1224 is designed to illuminate the water which is in the water
      container 1109.<br>
      <br>
      [0215] According to some embodiments of the present invention, the
      water container 1109 receives water from one or more water sources
      which are located in and/or on the vehicle. In such an embodiment,
      the water container 1109 may be external to the vehicle integrable
      device 1100, for example the water container of a tank, an
      airplane, a train and the like.<br>
      <br>
      [0216] Optionally, the aforementioned power monitoring module
      activates and/or deactivates the vehicle integrable device 1100

      water container 1109 and/or the main water tank 1319, where
      available are detachable. In such an embodiment, the water
      container may be released from the system and used for providing
      water to the passengers of the vehicles and/or carried for other
      consumers, such as a platoon which is in proximity to the vehicle,
      another vehicle, and/or carried for other usages. Optionally, the
      vehicle includes a number of detachable water containers. In such
      an embodiment, each time a certain water container is filled with
      accumulated water; it is replaced with another detachable water
      container. In such a manner, water may be accumulated when the
      water production conditions, namely the temperature, the power
      generation level, the humidity level and/or any combination
      thereof are above a certain level or optimal. Optionally, one or
      more of the detachable water container 1109 has one or more

      container 650 may have a number of different folding states so as
      to adjust the height of the foldable water container 650 according
      to the amount of water it accumulates. Optionally, the amount if
      water determines that height of the foldable water container 650
      as the pressure of the water pushes the two plates 653, 656 away
      from one another. Optionally, the foldable water container 650 has
      a cap 651 which may be adjusted in a designated water outlet
      and/or a handle, 652, optionally foldable. Optionally, the water
      container 1109 is divided to a number of sub-containers,
      optionally detachable. In such a manner, sub-containers may be
      provided to different consumers. Furthermore, a sub-container may
      be detached while others are filled.<br>

      illustration of a vehicle integrable device that combines both an
      air filtering system and a water filtering system, according to
      some embodiments of the present invention. Most of the components
      of the depicted vehicle integrable device 1100 are depicted and
      described above. However, in FIG. 12C, a blower 1451 is placed in
      proximity to the air filters 1204-1206. In addition, the cold
      evaporator coil 1158 and the hot condenser 1154 are connected to
      an expansion valve that controls the flow of the refrigerant from
      the refrigerant compressor 1162. The water vapor which are
      produced during the dehumidifying process are gather at the water
      container 1109 and forwarded, optionally when the controller 1107
      instructs a suitable valve, such as shown at 1456, toward the
      water filters 1222. The water are drawn by the water pump 1164 and
      optionally gathered at a main water container 1319. Water from the
      main water container 1319 is optionally poured when a respective
      valve is opened, as shown at 1458. The opening of and/or the
      closing of a designated valve 1457 between the main water
      container 1319 and a junction that splits between the water
      container 1109 and the water pump 1164 allows cycling water from
      the main water container 1319 via the filters 1222.<br>
      <br>
      [0222] According to some embodiments of the present invention, the
      vehicle integrable device 1100 is designed to condense water vapor
      from air with relatively high percentage of dust particles, for
      example surrounding air during a dust storm and/or a sand storm.
      In such an embodiment, one or more filters are used for trapping
      dust and/or sand grains. For example, reference is now also made
      to FIG. 13, which is a sectional schematic illustration of the
      vehicle integrable device 1100 with a debris filter 231, such as a
      cyclonic filter 231, for separating unwanted debris from an air
      with relatively high percentage of dust particles that is drawn
      via the air inlet 1101, according to some embodiments of the
      present invention. The components of the vehicle integrable device
      1100 are as described above in relation to FIG. 9A. FIG. 13
      further depicts the components of the cyclonic filter 231. In
      particular, the filtering unit 231 includes a cyclonic separator
      that draws dirty air 1241, via the air inlet 1101 into cyclone
      body 1242 having a structure that allows utilizing centrifugal
      forces and/or low pressure caused by spinning motion to separate
      materials of differing density, size and shape, for example as
      known in the art. Particles in the air are forced to the outside
      of the cyclone body 1242 by inertia. Due to surface effects, the
      air flow at the wall is slower. The slow air layer is incapable of
      suspending many of the particles, so these particles, for example
      dirt particles, drop to the bottom of the cyclonic filter 231 and
      settles out from the air stream into a conical section 1243 that
      ends in a dirt bin 1244 which is optionally connected to a dirt
      deposable unit 1245 that periodically, randomly, and/or upon
      command cleans it. The cleaned air flow is drawn via a gas outlet
      1246 that is connected to the aforementioned dehumidifying unit
      1105.<br>
      <br>
      [0223] According to some embodiments of the present invention, the
      components of the vehicle integrable device 1100 are placed in an
      external housing (not shown) that is designed to be attached to
      the vehicle from the outside and an internal housing (not shown)
      that is designed to be placed in the vehicle. In such an
      embodiment, the cold coil evaporator 1158 and the water container
      1109 are mounted inside the internal housing and the other
      components at the external housing of the vehicle. The two housing
      are connected to one another via one or more refrigerant tubes and
      one or more electrical cables.<br>
      <br>
      [0224] Additionally or alternatively, the air inlet 1101 in
      connected to receive air via one or more air filters of the
      vehicle. Optionally, the air inlet 1101 is connected to the outlet
      of the ventilation systems of the vehicle. In such a manner, the
      received air is filtered before being dehumidified by the vehicle
      integrable device 1100. Optionally, the air inlet 1101 is placed
      to receive air from the passenger comportment of the vehicle. In
      such a manner moisture emitted from the bodies of the passengers
      is filtered and condensed to water. Optionally, the air inlet 1101
      is connected to the hot air outlet of the engine.<br>
      <br>
      [0225] Additionally or alternatively, the air outlet 1103 is
      connected to one or more of the systems of the vehicle, for
      example to the suction valve of the engine and/or to the
      ventilation apertures of the passenger compartment.<br>
      <br>
      [0226] According to some embodiments of the present invention, one
      or more oxidizing materials are added to the accumulated water
      and/or drawn air. In such a manner, the air and/or water are
      sterilized.<br>
      <br>
      [0227] According to some embodiments of the present invention, the
      vehicle integrable device 1100 includes one or more shock
      absorbers, for example as depicted in numeral 778 of FIG. 16, that
      reduce the effect of vibration of the vehicle integrable device
      1100 during the operation of the vehicle.<br>
      <br>
      [0000] Optionally, the one or more shock absorbers include one or
      more rubber straps, pneumatic shock absorbers, hydraulic shock
      absorbers, springs, wire shock absorbers, such as wire a shock
      absorber, which include metal wires, synthetic resin wires, and/or
      stainless steel wire, and/or leafs, such as one or more strips of
      metal plastic and/or carbon. The shock absorbers may be connected
      to the housing that supports the components of the vehicle
      integrable device 1100 and/or directly to any of the components.<br>
      <br>
      [0228] As described above, the vehicle integrable device 1100 is
      powered by the vehicle's battery and/or alternator. Optionally,
      the vehicle integrable device 1100 includes a power monitoring
      module for monitoring the voltage of the power provided by the
      battery and/or alternator. Optionally, if the voltage is below a
      certain threshold, the power monitoring module shuts the vehicle
      integrable device 1100 or changes its operational mode to standby.<br>
      <br>
      [0229] Optionally, the vehicle integrable device 1100 includes a
      humidity sensor that monitors internal and/or ambient humidity. In
      such an embodiment, the output of the humidity sensor may be used
      for activating and/or deactivating the water production process of
      the vehicle integrable device 1100. Optionally, if the output
      indicates that the humidity is below a certain threshold, the
      vehicle integrable device 1100 shuts down or changes its
      operational mode to standby. Optionally, if the output indicates
      that the humidity is above a certain threshold, the vehicle
      integrable device 1100 is activated. Optionally, the humidity
      sensor is connected to a computing unit and/or integrated in a
      system on chip (SoC) which is connected to a presentation unit,
      such as a screen. In such an embodiment, the SoC or the computing
      unit may calculate the amount of water that may be generated per
      time and/or energy unit.<br>
      <br>
      [0230] Optionally, the vehicle integrable device 1100 includes a
      power sensor that monitors, directly or indirectly, power that is
      available for water production, for example by measuring the
      torque of the crankshaft, the voltage of the battery, and/or the
      revolutions per minute (RPM) of the vehicle's engine. In such an
      embodiment, the output of the power sensor may be used for
      activating and/or deactivating and/or to increase or decrease the
      water production process of the vehicle integrable device 1100.
      Optionally, if the output indicates that the generated power is
      below a certain threshold, the vehicle integrable device 1100
      shuts down or changes its operational mode to standby or economy
      mode. Optionally, if the output indicates that the power is above
      a certain threshold, the vehicle integrable device 1100 is
      activated. Optionally, the power sensor is connected to the
      aforementioned computing unit and/or integrated in a SoC that is
      connected to the aforementioned MMI 1108.<br>
      <br>
      [0231] Optionally, the vehicle integrable device 1100 has a number
      of operational modes, each adapted to a different weather, a
      different humidity level, a different voltage supply, a requested
      water production amount, and/or a combination thereof and/or to
      filter different particles from the blow air and/or the condensed
      water vapor. In such an embodiment, the vehicle integrable device
      1100 may have a variable turnout. For example, the vehicle
      integrable device 1100 employs one or more compressors, optionally
      multistage compressors and a means of modulating their capacity,
      automatically and/or manually, to match an instantaneous and/or
      predicted refrigeration demand. Optionally, this means includes an
      inverter that converts direct current from the vehicle into
      alternating current in variable speeds so as to control the amount
      of generated water and/or power consumption.<br>
      <br>
      [0232] Reference is now also made to FIG. 14, which is a flowchart
      of a method of producing water from air in a vehicle, according to
      some embodiments of the present invention. First, as shown at
      1550, a device, such as the vehicle integrable device 1100, is
      integrated into a vehicle. Optionally, the integration includes
      connecting the vehicle's power source to the vehicle integrable
      device 1100 so as to allow the powering of the water production,
      using the vehicle's ventilation system for drawing air via the
      vehicle integrable device 1100, using the vehicle's filters for
      filtering the air from which the water is generated, drawing moist
      air from the passenger comportment, using the water container of
      the vehicle, and/or any combination thereof.<br>
      <br>
      [0233] Now, as shown at 1551, moist air is pumped and/or blown,
      for example via the air inlet 1101 toward the dehumidifying unit
      1105. Optionally, the vehicle integrable device 1100 is
      automatically activated according to one or more weather
      measurements, for example temperature and/or humidity level.
      Additionally or alternatively, the vehicle integrable device 1100
      may present activation and/or deactivation recommendations based
      on the one or more weather measurements, for example using the MMI
      1108. The humidity level and the temperature are detected in the
      space from which the air is drawn, optionally according to the
      outputs of a hygrometer and/or a thermometer that interfaces with
      the controller 1107. The activation and/or recommendation may be
      computed according to each one of the measurements and/or a
      combination thereof.<br>
      <br>
      [0234] Additionally or alternatively, the user may define, for
      example using the MMI 1108, the amount of energy that is about to
      be consumed for the water production, for example in watts and/or
      in fuel gallons. In use, the controller 1107, which optionally
      comprises a memory unit for storing a table detailing activation
      patterns and/or a set of conversion equations that adjust an
      activation pattern according to the user's input, adjust the water
      production process accordingly.<br>
      <br>
      [0235] Then, as shown at 1552, the air is filtered, for example as
      described above. In such a manner, toxins, dust particles,
      different biomolecules, for example proteins and viruses, are
      filtered. Now, as shown at 1553, the water vapor in the filtered
      air is condensed, for example using the aforementioned
      dehumidifying unit 1105. For example, in the dehumidifying unit
      1105 depicted in FIG. 10, the water vapor are condensed on the
      cold evaporator coil 1158, optionally similarly to the described
      above. The condensing allows accumulating condensed water vapor in
      the water container 1109, for example as shown at 1554 and
      similarly to the described above. Now, as shown at 1555, the
      condensed water may be filtered, for example using the water
      filtering unit 1221, optionally similarly to the described above.
      As shown at 1556, this allows providing water to one or more
      passengers of the vehicle.<br>
      <br>
      [0236] Reference is now made to FIG. 15, which is a schematic
      illustration of the components of a self cleaning unit 1301 that
      is used for cleaning one or more of the aforementioned evaporator,
      and/or condenser and/or other parts according to some embodiments
      of the present invention. Optionally, the self cleaning unit 1301
      is integrated into the vehicle integrable device 1100 and
      connected to the controller 1107 thereof. In such an embodiment,
      the self cleaning unit 1301 may be activated manually by the
      aforementioned MMI 1107 and/or automatically from time to time,
      optionally according to a predefined schedule, and/or according to
      the amount of available water in the water container. Optionally,
      the water container 1109, or any other container, is used as a
      water source for the self cleaning unit 1301. The water container
      1109 further includes a pump 1302, such as a booster pump, for
      blowing the water via one or more of the, optionally water filters
      1222 and 1223 and/or via the condenser 1154 and/or evaporator,
      optionally by sprinklers 1305. Optionally, a valve, 1304 such as a
      solenoid valve, is used for extracting filtering water away from
      the vehicle integrable device 1100. Optionally, a valve, such as a
      solenoid valve 1303, is used for directing filtering water toward
      the sprinklers 1305. Optionally, the sprinklers 1305 may be
      designed to add sterilizing materials to the water. Optionally,
      the sprinklers 1305 create a steam which is used for sterilizing
      the surfaces of the cleaned elements. The filtering water may
      either be returned to the water container 1109, and/or extracted
      from the vehicle integrable device 1100 via a water outlet 1306.<br>
      <br>
      [0237] According to some embodiments of the present invention, the
      water generation unit, for example the vehicle integrable device
      1100, is mounted in a cart, such as a trolley, for example as
      shown in numeral 777 of FIG. 16. Optionally the casing 1079 of the
      vehicle integrable device 1100 is hardened, for example made of
      mil-spec rubber, such as Buna, Butyl, Nitrile, Neoprene, DuPont's
      Viton and Hypalon, EPDM, and/or a combination thereof. By using
      such a rubber, the casing provides sealing from CRBN (NBC) agents
      and/or particles. Optionally, the casing 1079 is locked using fast
      close knobs 80 and/or any other fasteners. In such an embodiment,
      the vehicle integrable device 1100 may be carried from one vehicle
      to another, for example using a telescopic handle 1071 and wheels
      1072.<br>
      <br>
      [0238] As depicted in FIG. 16 all many of the aforementioned
      components and units are housed in an interior space 81 of a
      single hardened casing 1079. This allows installing the vehicle
      integrable device 1100 in the vehicle without much effort and/or
      need to fixate each component and/or unit separately. The vehicle
      integrable device 1100 may be uninstalled without much effort as
      all the component and/or unit are connected to the vehicle as a
      single element.<br>
      <br>
      According to some embodiments of the present invention, the noise
      of the vehicle integrable device 1100 is reduced by covering the
      casing with a layer of mineral wool, such as Rockwool. Such a
      layer may also improve the thermo isolation vehicle integrable
      device 1100.<br>
      <br>
      [0240] Reference is now also made to FIG. 18, which is a flowchart
      of a method 800 of controlling one or more water generation units,
      such as 107, according to water output and/or operation of a
      vehicle air conditioner, such as 101 according to some embodiments
      of the present invention. First, as shown at 801, water generated
      as a product of the vehicle air conditioner 101 is accumulated.
      Then, as shown at 802, a change in the amount of the accumulated
      water and/or a change in the operation mode of the vehicle air
      conditioner are detected. Now, as shown 803, one or more water
      generation units are operated according to the detected amount
      and/or the detected current operation mode. For example, if the
      vehicle air conditioner 101 generates limited amount of water
      and/or works in a mode having low water production, the manager
      105 instructs the water generation unit 103 to increase their
      throughput. In another example, weather conditions, such as
      measured humidity level and/or temperature, allows estimating the
      water production level of the vehicle air conditioner 101. The
      manager 105 instructs the water generation unit 103 to increase
      and/or decrease their throughput according to the water production
      level of the vehicle air conditioner 101. As shown at 804, the
      water generated by the water generation unit 103, is accumulated.<br>
      <br>
      [0241] It is expected that during the life of a patent maturing
      from this application many relevant systems and methods will be
      developed and the scope of the term a water generation unit, a
      manager, a controller, and a water treatment unit is intended to
      include all such new technologies a priori.<br>
      <br>
      [0242] As used herein the term "about" refers to +-10%.<br>
      <br>
      [0243] The terms "comprises", "comprising", "includes",
      "including", "having" and their conjugates mean "including but not
      limited to". This term encompasses the terms "consisting of" and
      "consisting essentially of".<br>
      <br>
      [0244] The phrase "consisting essentially of" means that the
      composition or method may include additional ingredients and/or
      steps, but only if the additional ingredients and/or steps do not
      materially alter the basic and novel characteristics of the
      claimed composition or method.<br>
      <br>
      [0245] As used herein, the singular form "a", "an" and "the"
      include plural references unless the context clearly dictates
      otherwise. For example, the term "a compound" or "at least one
      compound" may include a plurality of compounds, including mixtures
      thereof.<br>
      <br>
      [0246] The word "exemplary" is used herein to mean "serving as an
      example, instance or illustration". Any embodiment described as
      "exemplary" is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or
      advantageous over other embodiments and/or to exclude the
      incorporation of features from other embodiments.<br>
      <br>
      [0247] The word "optionally" is used herein to mean "is provided
      in some embodiments and not provided in other embodiments". Any
      particular embodiment of the invention may include a plurality of
      "optional" features unless such features conflict.<br>
      <br>
      [0248] Throughout this application, various embodiments of this
      invention may be presented in a range format. It should be
      understood that the description in range format is merely for

      have specifically disclosed subranges such as from 1 to 3, from 1
      to 4, from 1 to 5, from 2 to 4, from 2 to 6, from 3 to 6 etc., as
      well as individual numbers within that range, for example, 1, 2,
      3, 4, 5, and 6. This applies regardless of the breadth of the
      range.<br>
      <br>
      [0249] Whenever a numerical range is indicated herein, it is meant
      to include any cited numeral (fractional or integral) within the

      indicate number and a second indicate number and "ranging/ranges
      from" a first indicate number "to" a second indicate number are
      used herein interchangeably and are meant to include the first and
      second indicated numbers and all the fractional and integral
      numerals therebetween.<br>
      <br>

      are, for brevity, described in the context of a single embodiment,
      may also be provided separately or in any suitable subcombination
      or as suitable in any other described embodiment of the invention.
      Certain features described in the context of various embodiments
      are not to be considered essential features of those embodiments,
      unless the embodiment is inoperative without those elements.<br>
