          <span style="font-weight: bold;">Apparatus of shielding
            against the biological effects of nonionizing
            electromagnetic radiations</span><br style="font-weight:
            bold;">
        </big></div>
      <br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract</span> -- The disclosed
      device comprises a container (1) intended to be placed in the
      vicinity of the source of said radiation and containing a medium
      (6) which has been subjected to prior irradiation and a metal salt
      or a combination of metal salts in said medium at a maximum
      concentration of 20 mg of salt(s) for 100 l of medium, said
      container being made of a non ferromagnetic material which is
      chemically neutral with respect to said medium and salt.
      Preferably, the salt is a salt of an alkaline metal or of an
      alkali earth metal, and the medium is an aqueous liquid medium.<br>
      <br>
      The invention relates to an apparatus of shielding against the
      biological effects of the nonionizing electromagnetic radiations,
      in particular those emitted by the domestic, office automation or
      industrial electrical apparatuses or electronic.<br>
      <br>
      In particular, the display screen apparatuses (which they are
      especially computerised monitors, television sets or terminals
      videotex), are considered to produce, because of the
      electromagnetic radiations which they emit, a certain number of
      biological harmful effects revealed by various organic disorders
      such as tires ocular, evils of head, states of stress, etc<br>
      <br>
      One indeed could show that the light radiations from the screen
      (embarrassment due to the light intensity, contrast, the
      concentration on a fixed image or to the frequency of scanning)
      are not the single causes of these organic disorders, but that the
      electromagnetic radiations (nonionizing) emitted by these ap
      similar also have proven biological effects.<br>
      <br>
      The invention has as an object an apparatus making it possible to
      protect itself against these last effects biological, suitable for
      the existence of a field of prevailing relatively intense
      radiation in the environment of use of these display screens or
      other generating similar elements of electromagnetic fields. In
      particular, the invention is not limited to the particular case of
      the display screen apparatuses, but is also intended to be used
      against the electromagnetic fields of all natures, created for
      example by the furnaces with microwaves, the lines with high
      tension, the cordless telephones and cellular telephones, the
      plays video, etc<br>
      <br>
      Various apparatuses were proposed to mitigate the effects of these
      radiations, but they proved in practice somewhat effective, and
      sometimes same hazardous because some propose to use elements
      which produce themselves of the nonionizing radiations, for
      example using ferrous webs forming bipolar, technical emitter
      whose harmlessness is far from being certain.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, the presumption of effectiveness on the human being
      or the animal of the majority of the apparatuses proposed up to
      now was not checked by biological experiments or biophysics.<br>
      <br>
      The apparatus of shielding of the invention, on the contrary, does
      not emit such nonionizing radiations and it made the biological
      test object and biophysics of effectiveness and harmlessness.<br>
      <br>
      N is characterized in what it includes/understands a container,
      intended to be laid out near the source of the aforesaid
      radiations, containing a medium having undergone a prior
      irradiation and a metal salt or a combination of metal salts
      carried by this medium with a maximum concentration of 20 salt mg
      (S) for 100 1 of medium, the aforementioned container being in a
      nonferromagnetic and chemically neutral material by respect to
      that the medium and salt.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably, the aforementioned salt is an alkaline salt of a metal
      or alkaline-earth and the aforementioned medium is a liquid
      medium, especially an aqueous medium.<br>
      <br>
      The aforementioned prior irradiation of the medium can be
      beneficial lies realized by use of an antenna To lick placed above
      a volume of the aforesaid medium and held with the hand by one of
      its branches, or by use of a radiation source coherent associated
      means to cooperate with the hand of an operator.<br>
      <br>
      The aforementioned container can especially have the shape of at
      least a closed elongated tube at its two ends, for example of two
      parallel tubes laid out coast at coast, and length ranging between
      10 and 25 cm.<br>
      <br>
      One now will describe an example of performing of the apparatus of
      the invention, in reference with the annexed drawings.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Figure 1</span> is a view
      perspective showing the general configuration of the apparatus of
      the invention.<br>

      of placement of this apparatus on a transmitter apparatus of
      radiations opposite from which one wishes to protect oneself.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Figure 4</span> illustrates a

      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Figures 6 and 7</span> are
      diagrams showing the clinical results of studies carried out to
      show the effectiveness of the apparatus of the invention.<br>
      <br>
      <div style="text-align: center;">
        <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="wo9325270d.jpg"

      </div>
      <br>
      On figures 1 and 2, one represented an apparatus of shielding in
      accordance with the invention, which is carried out in the form of
      two hollow parallel tubes similar 1, sealed with each one of their
      ends 2 by an appropriate means (for example a depressed steel ball
      3 with force as illustrated on the figure, or by plugging by means
      of a crosslinkable elastomer, or by mechanical crimping, etc).<br>
      <br>
      These tubes are maintained, for example in a central region, by a
      common carrier 4 allowing moreover the fixing of the apparatus on
      an appropriate place of the apparatus which one wants to protect
      oneself, for example by means of a pellet of adhesive dual face 5.
      Figure 3 illustrates an example of apparatus in accordance with
      the invention placed against a lateral wall of a computerised
      monitor, therefore near the radiation sources of the display
      screen of this one.<br>
      <br>
      The tubes 1 are filled with liquid appropriate 6 which one will
      describe the composition further. Tubes 1 must be in a
      nonferromagnetic and chemically neutral material (not reagent)
      compared to liquid the 6; it can be in metal, for example in
      landed nium or an aluminium alloy, or in a synthetic material such
      as a polyamide or a polypropylene. In the illustrated example,
      each tube has an inner diameter of 4 mms and an outer diameter of
      6 mms, with an overall length of 17 cm for an inner length useful
      of approximately 15 cm, which gives to each tube a capacity of
      about 1,5 to 2 Cm3, value (nonrestrictive) corresponding with the
      amount of liquid required to ensure a shielding against the
      typically emitted radiations by an apparatus of type monitor to
      computer or television set.<br>
      <br>
      It will be noted that the form and the dimensions illustrated on
      figures 1 and 2, if they are beneficial, are not essential for the
      implementation of the invention, whose essential principle lies in
      the nature and the treatment from liquid the 6. Thus, other forms
      can be considered, for example spiral, ring, hollow sphere
      defining an interior volume having a capacitance of the same order
      of size. Moreover, if one envisages two tubes (or two rings, etc),
      the materials of the two containers can be different, since they
      are nonferromagnetic and neutral with regard to the liquid one
      that they contain.<br>
      <br>
      One now will describe the manner whose the active liquid medium 6
      is prepared. One will note in this respect this active medium is
      not necessarily present in liquid form, but can be it in form
      solid, gaseous, gelled, etc<br>
      <br>
      One takes an aqueous medium, for example purified water, and one
      subjects it to a pretreatment nonionizing irradiation, for
      example, like illustrated figure 4, by means of an antenna of<br>
      To lick: this antenna 7 is placed above a container 6 tells nant
      the aqueous medium, and it is held with the hand by one of its two
      branches (magnetized stems 8), while the dimension of the resonant
      loop 9 is adjusted by the movable web 10 at a frequency of
      resonance ranging between 0 and 10000 MHZ; the antenna is
      maintained by hand 11 of the operator above it container 6 in
      order to to realize, of manner in itself known, a resonant
      coupling between the operator and aqueous medium 6 and to thus
      operate a nonionizing irradiation of this last.<br>
      <br>
      A variant of implementation of the irradiation can be carried out,
      like illustrated figure 5, by application of an emitted coherent
      radiation 12 by a laser 13 associated means to cooperate with hand
      11 of the operator, for example a formed loop 15 in line of supply
      14 of laser 13 and in which ltopéra- tor will pass his hand, so as
      to still ensure here a coupling between the hand of the operator
      and aqueous medium 6 contents in the illuminated container by the
      laser.<br>
      <br>
      The aqueous medium thus prepared is added with a metal salt or a
      combination of metal salts, with a maximum concentration of 20
      salt mg (S) for 100 liters of aqueous medium.<br>
      <br>
      It will be noted that the adding of salt can indifferently be
      carried out before or after the nonionizing prior irradiation
      which one has just described in reference on figures 4 and 5.<br>
      <br>
      The selected metal salt is preferably a salt of a metal belonging
      with the formed group by Li, Na, Rb, K, Cs, Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba, Fez++,
      Co, Ni, Mn, Zn, Cd, Pb, Cu, Fe++, Ag, Hg, by excluding rare earth
      salts preferably and by choosing an alkaline or alkaline-earth
      salt of a metal preferably.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, it will be noted that the maximum value of
      concentration of salt (or salts) indicated higher is substantially
      indépen- dante of the nature of selected salt.<br>
      <br>
      0<br>
      One now will give a certain number of clinical test results
      showing the results gotten by the apparatus of the invention.
      Previously, it will be noted that, with the apparatus describes
      higher, the effect of shielding is obtained until several tens of
      centimetres, typically up to 3 to 4 metres of ray, thus allowing
      to completely protect the user whatever his position compared to
      the source of electromagnetic radiation and whatever the place
      where the apparatus of the invention near this same source is
      placed (this last positioning not being a critical parameter for
      the obtaining of an effective shielding).<br>
      <br>
      1) Posturologic study<br>
      One studied the position and the evolution with the floor of the
      projection of the center of gravity of an individual placed on a
      platform of clinical stabilometry standardized (for example of
      type Dynatronic Don50) giving in particular an indication of the
      stability of the individual and of his laterality by analysis of
      the surface (stability) and the off-centring (laterality) of the
      trace of the projection of the center of gravity on the
      statokinésigramme obtained.<br>
      <br>
      An excess of surface and/or an excessive laterality are usually
      correlated with pathologies such as strabism, disorders of ocular
      convergence, lumbagos, cervicalgies, sensations vertiginous, etc<br>
      <br>
      On a sample of 35 persons, the posture of each individual was
      analyzed pendent one duration 50 seconds: initially without
      computer with proximity, then with computer placed at 70 cm but
      without apparatus in accordance with the invention (situation
      which one will call thereafter “nonprotected screen”), and finally
      with the same computer provided with an apparatus in accordance
      with the invention (“protected screen”).<br>
      <br>
      It is observed that in 73,3% of the case (of including 63,5% in a
      statistically significant way, i.e. introducing to a deviation of
      laterality of at least E 7,1 mms), the individuals in front of the
      protected screen improve their postural balance and thus eliminate
      a factor of tiredness and disorders organic or psychological being
      able to be bonded with the working on screen.<br>
      <br>
      This study watch moreover that:<br>
      - a third of the persons having presented the aforementioned
      improvement<br>
      change left/right laterality,<br>
      - 46,5% of the persons improve their balance in front of the
      screen<br>
      protected compared to the initial measuring carried out without
      screen,<br>
      -40% of the individuals worsen their imbalance in laterality<br>
      when they pass from the initial situation without screen to
      located<br>
      tion with nonprotected screen, and<br>
      - it noted forever of aggravation statistically signi<br>
      ficative of laterality because of addition of the apparatus<br>
      in accordance with the invention.<br>
      <br>
      2) Immunologic study<br>
      This study, carried out on five subjects, takes into account the
      respect Thelper lymphocytes/Tinducteur lymphocytes, especially the
      rate CD5/CD20 which, when it increases, is an indicator of the
      tendency to develop autoimmune diseases and, when it decrease,
      indicates an improvement of the immune potential. A normal rate is
      around 10%, a deviation between two analyses being regarded as
      significant for a variation from at least stupid 15% compared to
      the initial digit.<br>
      <br>
      The persons all tested were users of computerised screens pendent
      several hours per day.<br>
      <br>
      The blood analyses were carried out as follows:<br>
      Subjects 1, 2, 3: first analysis with nonprotected screen, deuxiè<br>
      me analysis with pendent protected screen 14 days,<br>
      Subject 4: first analysis with nonprotected screen, deuxiè<br>
      me analysis with pendent protected screen 7 days,<br>
      Subject 5: first analysis with protected screen since more<br>
      of 3 months, second analysis after 14 days of<br>
      blanking of the shielding.<br>
      <br>
      The results given on graphic are referred the &amp;num; 1 with #5
      of figure 6, respectively for the five subjects considered; the
      single hatchings correspond to a situation with nonprotected
      screen and the crossed hatchings, with a situation with protected
      screen by the apparatus of the invention. One can see that, except
      for subject N 4 for which the variation of rate CD5/CD20 is not
      sufficiently significant, for the other subjects the passage of a
      situation of nonprotected screen to a situation of protected
      screen watch a significant improvement of the immune potential of
      the individual.<br>
      <br>
      Inversely, in the case of the subject n0 5 the blanking of the
      shielding showed a degradation of the immune potential.<br>
      <br>
      3) Energetic study of medicine<br>
      In this study, one has measured, by the auriculo-cardiac reflex
      according to the Nogier method, the quantitative variations of the
      energetic fields, expressed in-depth of penetration, corresponding
      ones to a superficial tissue, an average tissue and a deep tissue;
      the respective values considered as normal are typically 6 cm, 8
      cm and 10 cm, a value lower corresponding one with a degradation
      of the potential of the individual.<br>
      <br>
      Measuring was carried out on ten patients, successively in a
      situation without screen, with nonprotected screen and protected
      screen.<br>
      <br>
      The results are illustrated on figures 7 (has) with (c),
      respectively for a superficial tissue, an average tissue and a
      deep tissue.<br>
      <br>
      The absence of hatchings corresponds to the situation without
      screen, of the single hatchings correspond to a nonprotected
      screen and crossed hatchings with a protected screen. The values
      spans on the graphic ones are the average values of given
      collected for the whole of the sample.<br>
      <br>
      As one can very clearly see it with the examination of graphic of
      these figures, one notes that the potential capacitances of the
      individual, highly degraded by a situation of working on
      nonprotected screen, are, according to case's, integrally or
      nearly completely restored by the use of the device of the
      invention.<br>
      <br>
      4) Neurophvsiologic study<br>
      One studied the neurophysiological parameters of a sample of
      patients working daily on computerised terminal.<br>
      <br>
      These patients work first of all on nonprotected monitors; at the
      4th day, one carries out a first neurophysiological study, at the
      7th day one place the apparatus of shielding of the invention and
      at the 18th day one carries out one second neurophysiological
      study.<br>
      <br>
      One notes between the two observing a net improvement of the
      response to the light stimulus for the sequences closed eyes/open
      eyes and, especially, to the light pacings with 20 Hz, on the one
      hand for the whole (0,5-31,5 Hz) of the band recorded by the
      electroencephalograph, on the other hand for the bands alpha (7,5
      to 13,5 Hz) and beta (13,5 to 31,5 Hz). As a whole, this increase
      goes from single to the dual one. <br>
