      The invention relates to an apparatus to the promotion and
      acceleration of the growth of humans and animals and to the
      acceleration of the restoration of the health from humans and
      animals to disease and injury as well as to the assistance of
      healing processes.<br>
      <br>
      Such apparatuses, which exhibit the form of a cone with rounded
      off tip and whereby radial are, along production longitudinal
      reinforcement or ribs and intermediate openings provided, are on
      the market. They consist of plastic.<br>
      <br>
      The impact of these apparatuses is unknown contrary to the
      experimental confirmed effect.<br>
      <br>
      Used ones become such apparatuses either by attachment above or
      beside the organism which can be treated or, with small
      apparatuses, by direct presenting on the location which can be
      treated.<br>
      <br>
      The invention is based on the surprising finding that the effect
      of a such apparatus can be increased to substantial, if it
      consists of a combination at least two of the subsequent elements,
      if necessary with appropriate selected intermediate pieces: a)
      Pyramid with at least hexagonal base surface; b) Pyramidenstumpf
      with at least hexagonal reason and top surface; c) Cylinder; d)
      Zwickelkuppel; e) zwickelkuppelstumpf; f) Toroidabschnitt; g)
      Paraboloidzone or - cap; h) Ellipsoid zone or - cap; i) Ledge on
      the surface one of the elements A) to h) those the form of
      elongated thickenings, projections or waves has or through in
      series disposed projections, bulges or recesses, which in each
      case the form one of the elements A) to h) or of combinations of
      such Ele to have can, formed mente will, whereby also two various
      dimensioned elements of the same group are combinable, with the
      wet gift that, if only one of the elements A) to h) with elements
      i) combined becomes, at least six elements i) provided is.<br>
      <br>
      The elements mentioned exhibit prefered circle symmetry and/or.
      are regular (pyramids, etc.). It is possible, instead of planning
      circular cross-sections elliptical cross sections, whereby the
      aspect ratio of the longer axis favourable-proves to shorter 3:1
      does not exceed. In case of the polygons this has a distortion of
      the base surface to the sequence. The ellipsoid is a prefered
      ball.<br>
      <br>
      Bottom Zwickelkuppel (blunt) becomes flat understood in the
      description a dome (blunt), the out simple curved surfaces (e.g.
      Cylindrical surfaces) over a polygon constructed is, whereby the
      production of the simple curved surfaces parallel in each case for
      the associated polygon side run.<br>
      <br>
      Bottom ball cap becomes understood in the description the surface
      of a ball, which becomes limited of a small circle or a great
      circle (equator) of the ball.<br>
      <br>
      Ball zones are surface portions of balls, which become of two
      small circles or limited of a small circle and an equator, whereby
      the two limiting circles lie in to each other parallel planes.<br>
      <br>
      Analogue one applies to the ellipsoid and Paraboloid.<br>
      <br>
      The combination of two elements made so that their axes aligning,
      whereby an apparatus with axis of symmetry develops. With other
      elements can lost add this symmetry go, but become symmetrical
      apparatuses prefered. It becomes also prefered that the
      unsymmetrical added elements are if possible small compared with
      the symmetrical disposed elements.<br>
      <br>
      The wall thickness of the apparatus according to invention is
      small compared with the radiuses of curvature (except that of the
      ledges), depends on the size of the apparatus and the used
      material and amounts to usually some millimeters.<br>
      <br>
      In an embodiment provided can be that the apparatus on their
      surface smaller elements A) to h) or exhibits combinations of such
      elements, prefered in symmetrical arrangement.<br>
      <br>
      The apparatus according to invention can consist of metal or
      plastic, whereby metal is not to be processed so simple and to
      heavier apparatuses leads.<br>
      <br>
      From the plastics practical all used can become, whereby the
      differences are more negligible in the effect practical. Come both
      the thermoplastics, for example polyethylene and polyvinylchloride
      into question, and the thermosetting polymers, like the phenol
      formaldehyde resins, the Melamin and urea formaldehyde resins.<br>
      <br>
      Prefered ones become for example polyacrylonitriles,
      Polypropylene, polycarbonates, polymethacrylates, polystyrene and
      polyacetal. Also rubber or glass can become used.<br>
      <br>
      The size of the apparatus depends on its application and is enough
      from some centimeters diameters up to a diameter of a metre and
      over it.<br>
      <br>
      It has itself shown that the effect of apparatuses according to
      invention, which from any combination at least two elements A) to
      h), other increased exists become can, if ledges, thus elements
      i), in planes provided to become, the parallel the cutting planes
      of the individual elements A) to h) run. The ledges at the outside
      or at the inside of the thin walled apparatus can be disposed or
      also by the formation of waves in the wall. The radiuses of
      curvature of the ledges and/or. that it formed parts are for
      instance from the order of magnitude of the wall thickness.<br>
      <br>
      In an advantageous embodiment provided is to combine several
      ledges into bands and to plan into the smooth intermediate range
      (EN) openings. This measure is particularly then suspended for an
      improvement of the effect, if the apparatus with vertical axis,
      thus horizontal longitudinal cutting planes with the ball cap at
      highest location disposed, becomes used, for example over the user
      becomes favourable. With use with horizontal axis can be done
      without the arrangement of the openings.<br>
      <br>
      To the number of the ledges it is considered as rule of thumb that
      the effect increase per ledge with the number of the already
      present ledges becomes ever smaller.<br>
      <br>
      It is possible that the apparatus in the range of the pole - among
      them the intersection of the highest element with the axis of
      symmetry of the apparatus understood becomes - an opening
      exhibits, those the handling of the apparatus facilitated. For
      example a support can be attached, in order to be able to hang the
      apparatus up with vertical axis at the opening. To the treatment
      of small-area body parts direct presenting of a corresponding
      dimensioned apparatus is possible on the range which can be
      treated<br>
      <br>
      The invention is in the drawing shown on the basis an embodiment.<br>

      Fig. variants of apparatuses according to invention, Fig show 1 to
      4. 5 to 7 shows details and the Fig. a variant used with a
      bioassay shows 8.<br>
      <br>
      In Fig. 1 is an apparatus according to invention, constructed from
      three ball zones and a Kugelkalotte shown. The ball zones 1, 2 and
      3 have parallel Schnittkreise 4 and 5 and the highest ball zone 3
      cut to each other in each case the Kugelkalotte 6 likewise after a
      Schnittkreis 7, which is appropriate for parallel to the
      Schnittkreisen 4 and 5.<br>
      <br>
      The centers of these circles are appropriate on the axis of
      symmetry 8 for the apparatus according to invention and also the
      lowest delimitation circle 9 lie in a plane normal to the axis of
      symmetry 8.<br>
      <br>
      Naturally possible changes various with a such apparatus are to be
      made, then the respective delimitation circles need to exhibit
      adjacent ball zones not same diameter, but can in corresponding
      annular connectors connected with one another be. It can be
      natural instead of the circular cross-section an elliptical cross
      section provided, whereby from the ball zones and/or. the
      Kugelkalotte ellipsoid zones and a Ellipsoidkalotte become.<br>
      <br>
      In Fig. 2 is an apparatus according to invention shown, which
      consists 10 and several ledges 11 of a ball zone 9, an immediate
      Kugelkalotte subsequent to it. The ledges 11 are in each case 10
      disposed to various formed bands summarized and are in particular
      also in the range of the transition between the ball zone 9 and
      the Kugelkalotte.<br>
      <br>
      Further openings are provided in this apparatus, whereby are shown
      for illustration purposes the various possible forms. Like that
      circular apertures 12, a triangular opening 13, are and several
      polygonal limited openings 14 shown. These openings can be in the
      smooth ranges between the ledges 11 provided, as for example the
      openings 13, 14 or also in the range of the ledges, as show this
      some the openings 12. Like other performed above, planning of such
      openings is particularly useful if the apparatus is to thus become
      as shown, oriented, with vertical axis 8 used. The asymmetric
      arrangement of the holes so, as it is shown, does not have thereby
      in the sense of the invention influence on the symmetrical
      embodiment of the apparatus in their fundamentals.<br>
      <br>
      In Fig. 3 is a more complex variant shown, with which the effect
      essentially arises inside the apparatus. Below an almost
      kugelkappenförmigen ball zone 15, disposed at whose pole an actual
      known cone is 16 on a pedestal, a cylinder portion is 17 disposed,
      which rests on a reverse ball zone 18 oriented to the ball zone
      15. The transitions between the two ball zones and the cylinder do
      not run steady, but there is corresponding planar connectors 19,
      20 provided. Instead of these pieces naturally also another
      transition piece provided can be, for example a torus cutout, like
      it below the ball zone 18 with 21 referred is or also actual known
      truncated cones.<br>
      <br>
      In Fig. 4 is a combination of a ball cap with ledges shown. At
      least according to invention six ledges used become, those in case
      of the Fig. 4 to various formed bands summarized are. In the upper
      portion of the apparatus again variants of openings are 24
      provided, which show other examples usable openings.<br>
      <br>
      In Fig. 5 to 7 is in the cross section by the wall of apparatuses
      according to invention examples of the formation of the ledges
      shown. In Fig. 5 is this at the top in series disposed
      kugelkappenförmige elements 25, kugelkappenförmige recesses 26 and
      pyramidal projections 27. In the sequence continuous ledges with
      various cross section are shown, for example with 28 with
      triangular cross section, double borders 29 or simple borders 30
      with other height. It is also possible that the ledges exhibit a
      polygonal cross section, as with 31 shown.<br>
      <br>
      Such ledges or series of discrete elements can also at the
      underside and/or. Inside of the device walls disposed its, like
      this also from Fig. 5 is more removable. Conical recesses 32 are
      just as possible, as continuous ledges 33, kalottenförmige
      Recesses 34 or pyramid-like projections 35. The discrete elements
      are disposed thereby again in row form.<br>
      <br>
      In Fig. 6 is partial more complex elements shown. So a lenticular
      projection 36 on a side of the wall can be the polygonal recess 37
      on the opposite wall side associated. It can face a such bulge 36
      also series discrete notches 38. Finally it is also possible to
      hold the wall thickness practical same and to form a type wave 39.
      Of course also grooves with arcuate or other cross section can, as
      become with 40 used.<br>
      <br>
      Fig. a formation shows 7, is 42 associated with which a closer
      outside corrugation 41 an other inner corrugation. Naturally the
      interior and outsides can be exchanged and be become also various
      combinations of the formation of the ledges made.<br>
      <br>

      of Novi Sad, Yugoslavia, with an apparatus in accordance with the
      Fig. 8 performed experiments the respective weight behavior adult
      rats.<br>

      An experimental group and a control group a month became prolonged
      held in identical cages. The animals of the experimental group
      became five times in the week (Monday until Friday) in each case
      two hours in a removal of 80 cms of the bottom illustrated
      apparatus, whose diameter amounted to 80 cms, positioned. On
      similar manner the control group a bottom flat plate of the same
      material (polystyrene) became brought. All animals had continuous
      waters and feeds available in unlimited amount.<br>
      <br>
      The animals of the experimental group a shown even weight process
      over the duration of test than the animals of the control group
      (see table). As far as without particular apparatus and
      experimental assembly found could become, the animals of the
      experimental group were balanced as the animals of the control
      group.<br>

      Since the body mass is a parameter for the metabolic intensity and
      an integral sign of the assimilation and dissimilation processes,
      which shows the synthesis of complex organic compound included,
      the experimental result unambiguously the well-being and the
      health promoting effect of the apparatus according to invention.<br>
      <br>
      The invention is not limited to the represented embodiments; other
      diameters and/or other of the individual elements selected can
      have another number of&nbsp; corrugations and these can be also
      differently disposed.<br>
      <br>
      It can have the number, distribution and form differentl than
      shown and&nbsp; the basic form of the elements can be changed so
      that the cut curves are not circles, but ellipses. In this case
      there is not so strong a concentrated efficacy of the apparatus,
      but however results in being disrtibuted over a larger surface.<br>
