          <span style="font-weight: bold;"> Abstract</span> -- <strong></strong>A
          hollow body (10) in the form of a regular pyramid with a
          square base has an outer attachment (18) along its one bottom
          edge (14), on which attachment a magnetic compass (20) is
          secured, a marking (24; 25), provided on the attachment (18),
          lying with the compass axis in a plane which is parallel to
          one pair of bottom edges (14) and at right angles to the other
          pair of bottom edges. The hollow body (10) can be moved
          quickly and accurately into a position in which two parallel
          bottom edges (14; 16) are aligned in the earth's North-South
          direction. In this position, the hollow pyramid is able to
          accrue cosmobiological energy and to supply it to objects
          situated therein.<br>
        </div>
        <p align="left">The invention relates to a mechanism for
          collecting energy, existing from an hollow body in form of a
          down open, regular pyramid with square plan view.</p>
        <p align="left"> </p>
        <p align="left">Known that hollow bodies are in form regular
          pyramids then, if they are accurate with two their bottom
          edges in north south direction of the earth aligned in the
          layer, kosmobiologische energy is to be collected and these on
          subject matters inner#halb the hollow body to transmitted.
          Such subject matters load themselves with the stored energy
          and are in the layer to deliver it at organisms (indirect
          method). As such subject matters only for example infrage cups
          with drinking water, juices, teas, further foods, in addition,
          at the body come to supporting decoration, rings, bracelets,
          chains and such. Also for the prophylactic and therapeutic
          treatment of plants the mechanism with success becomes used.</p>
        <p align="left"> </p>
        <p align="left">It is proven that tap water, which in a vessel
          in this particular hollow body for a certain time stored was
          with success for casting purposes for cut flowers, garden
          flowers and - as well as seeds and setting plants used plant
          became, whereby these plants very vigorous prospered and such,
          which were affected of pests, recovered again. For the humans
          those work the bottom pyramidal hollow body stored subject
          matters depending upon the intended purpose activating or also
          reassuring. Sleeplessness with persons could become detectable
          in many cases eliminated, if these persons before the sleeping
          going drank a glass water, which to about 12 hours the bottom
          pyramidal hollow body confessed.</p>
        <p align="left"> </p>
        <p align="left">The pyramidal hollow bodies is suitable also for
          the direct energy transfer on humans, animals and plants. The
          best efficiency becomes achieved, if these organisms are for a
          while in the hollow body. Experiences with seeds and setting
          plants have shown that these, if them some days before sowing
          and/or. before setting the bottom hollow body stored, latter
          in the soil more vigorous prospered as comparable seeds and
          plants, which became treated in conventional manner.</p>
        <p align="left"> </p>
        <p align="left">For the function to sammen kosmobiologische
          energy is however essential it that the pyramidal hollow
          bodies the Erdachse accurate aligned established becomes.</p>
        <p align="left"> </p>
        <p align="left">In addition one can avail oneself of a
          conventional compass. Compasses with a rectangle housing,
          whose north south mark parallel or rectangular runs to one of
          the edges of housing, could become at the bottom edge of the
          pyramidal hollow body applied, in order to turn the unit
          existing from hollow body and compass into the north south
          direction of the earth or rectangular. The handling is however
          unpractical, because two possibilities of error can occur next
          to each other and noted to become to have, once the exact
          north south alignment of the compass and on the other hand the
          gap-free plant of the Kompassgehäuses at the hollow body soil
          edge. With larger hollow bodies with corresponding weight of
          required one both hands for the setting-up of the hollow body
          this must become first into a coarse estimated position
          brought, which will then align etc., so that one must
          near-grope stepwise to the correct position, by application of
          the compass checked, according to which again both hands are
          necessary, around the hollow body again by estimate better an
          handling, which is extremely pedantic, time-consuming and
          frequent still another inaccurate result brings. Normal,
          simple magnetic compasses already are due to their functional
          construction of circular shape. With these compasses exact
          aligning of the pyramidal hollow body is possible not at all.
        </p>
        <p align="left"> </p>
        <p align="left">Object of the invention is it to create a
          mechanism that initially mentioned type with which the
          pyramidal hollow bodies fast and accurate into the proper
          position brought can become, which is indispensable for its
          function. </p>
        <p align="left"> </p>
        <p align="left">This object becomes according to invention
          dissolved by the fact that is fixed connected with a hollow
          body wall a magnetic compass with vertical Rome passport axle
          and that in the surround of the compass at the hollow body or
          an approach of the hollow body or at the compass at least a
          mark provided is, whose stands the compass axle contained
          vertical plane to a pair bottom edges of the hollow body
          rectangular.</p>
        <p align="left"> </p>
        <p align="left">With comparatively small hollow bodies Rome
          passport is subsequent horizontal-lax at an outside, to a
          lower wall edge, with larger preferably commits themselves
          cash hollow bodies, in particular tents is it preferably at
          inward horizontal-lax mounted pointing from at least a bottom
          edge of the hollow body.</p>
        <p align="left"> </p>
        <p align="left">With the invention achieved becomes that the
          position of the Kom; passport concerning the pyramidal hollow
          body once and for all, so that the hollow body and the compass
          form a contiguous unit, an uniform turning is fixed around the
          pyramid axle also the allowed if the hollow body has a
          relevant weight and the use of both hands requires. It would
          be more conceivable to plan in one pyramid-flat a recess and
          to use the compass in such a way into this recess that the
          extension would be the pyramid-flat the compass halved,
          however the energy collecting function of the pyramidal hollow
          body at least weakened. The incorporation of a ball compass
          into a hollow body wall brings however the desired handling
          advantages, so that this embodiment belongs to the invention.</p>
        <p align="left"> </p>
        <p align="left">However the embodiment, is provided with which
          at the pyramidal hollow body an approach or a tab, is
          preferred on which the compass attached is. With this
          embodiment becomes it is enough that the pyramid-flat are
          no-break.</p>
        <p align="left"> </p>
        <p align="left">This is in particular important for the bottom
          edges of the pyramid-flat. The whole pyramid does not remain
          as such unchanged obtained and preferably the approach or lobe
          subsequent at the bottom edge of a pyramid-flat interrupts the
          pyramid edge.</p>
        <p align="left"> </p>
        <p align="left">The invention possible it to position the
          subject matters or organisms mentioned on an appropriate
          horizontal-flat and to invert and these subsequent its bottom
          edges parallel with two in north south direction with a brief
          adjusting movement exact and correct adjust then the pyramidal
          hollow body over it.</p>
        <p align="left"> </p>
        <p align="left"> A development of the invention consists of the
          fact that the mark or marks on the tab mounted, in particular
          printed is. It is sufficient according to experience that the
          pyramidal hollow bodies of cardboard consists. From such
          cardboard material can the hollow body cut punched and in
          known manner composite to become. The cut contains the
          mounting strap for the compass, which is connected over a
          bottom edge with a pyramid wall, whereby this bottom edge
          forms a bending line. The tab puts then to automatic into the
          base plane of the pyramid. Substantial one is that with the
          attachment of the compass to the fact it is paid attention
          that the mark and the compass axle form a plane, which forms
          with one of the adjacent hollow body bottom edges a right
          angle or for parallel in addition is appropriate.</p>
        <p align="left"> </p>
        <p align="left">An other embodiment consists of it that the tab
          is thick walled formed, for example of wood exists and that
          the compass is in, a depth the same compass-high an exhibiting
          recess of the tab used. The compass surface lies thereby with
          the surface of the tab flush and the mark still simpler e.g.
          leaves itself. arrange in form of a notch for instance in same
          height as the compass needle.</p>
        <p align="left"> </p>
        <p align="left">Alternative one consists an embodiment of the
          invention of the fact that the transparent compass covers one
          exhibits radial longitudinal mark to the Kom passport axle. In
          accordance with this embodiment needs at the hollow body
          and/or. at the hollow body beginning or - to become latch no
          more mark provided, and it even still becomes at reading
          precision gained, because the compass needle must become only
          brought with the radial marking line covering. It is
          indispensable also here that with the assembly of the compass
          the positional accuracy of the mark concerning the pyramid
          soil edges one respects. In addition, the mark can be at
          another location of the compass mounted, and here a
          modification consists of the fact that the mark at the edge of
          the Kom of passport housing is provided.</p>
        <p align="left"> </p>
        <p align="left">Finally still another development of the
          invention consists of the fact that in the hollow body
          disposed with this unzusammenhängender bottom is in form of a
          Pyramidenstumpfes, whose base surface is the same geometric
          base surface of the hollow body, whose outside pyramid-flat
          parallel and dense adjacent lie to the inner surfaces of the
          hollow body walls and for whose height within the range of 10%
          to 30% the hollow body-high is appropriate. This bottom can be
          from full material or in form of an hollow pot formed and it
          is only substantial ones that the upper top surface of the
          bottom the light interiorhigh of the pyramidal hollow body
          reduced, without changing its geometric, regular pyramid form.
          This bottom has the advantage that smaller subject matters,
          which are to be loaded according to invention with
          kosmobiologischer energy in the optimum effective range
          positioned is appropriate to become to be able, for these in
          the indicated high range, which can be limited with
          particularly small subject matters as between 20% to 33% of
          the entire pyramid-high still narrower.</p>
        <p align="left"> </p>
        <p align="left">To the achievement of optimum energy collecting
          results the ratio of height of the hollow body to the length
          of a bottom edge lies within the range of 0,7 to 0.9 and
          amounts to before zugsweise about 0,8.</p>
        <p align="left"> </p>
        <p align="left">The hollow body is outer preferably colored
          held, all four pyramid-flat have the same color.</p>
        <p align="left"> </p>
        <p align="left">The color red proved to the achievement of an
          exciting effect. The color blue collects against it calming
          energy.</p>
        <p align="left"> </p>
        <p align="left">The hollow body exists erfindungsgemäss'aus a
          thin walled material. Except cardboard the hollow body can
          consist coppers in accordance with an embodiment of the
          invention of wood, plastic or also non--iron sheet, in
          particular.</p>
        <p align="left"> </p>
        <p align="left">On the basis the drawing, which represents an
          embodiment, the invention is more near described.</p>

        <p align="left"> </p>
        <p align="left">The general hollow bodies referred with 10 is
          thin walled and consists of a carton blank. The hollow body
          exhibits four triangular side faces, which are equal-leg and
          which form a down open, regular pyramid with square plan view
          in the assembled state. In an embodiment behave the height of
          the pyramid 187 mm, the soil edge length 236 mm and the side
          edge length 250 mm resultant from it. For the function it does
          not depend however on the absolute sketch mass. Important one
          is rather that the ratio from height to soil edge length of
          the pyramid amounts to about 0.8. In the embodiment this ratio
          is 0,79. The pyramid 10 is open with the four pyramid walls 12
          circumferential perfect closed and only on the base side.</p>
        <p align="left"> </p>
        <p align="left">On a bottom edge 16 the pyramid-flat 12 hangs a
          tab 18. The bottom edge 14 forms a folding line between the
          pyramid-flat 12 and the tab 18. If the pyramid is 10 provided
          on a planar support, then the tab 18 horizontal lies on this
          support. The tab 18 is likewise triangular. The
          basis-prolonged of the triangle is the same basis-prolonged of
          a three-lateral pyramid-flat. Those the base of the triangular
          tab 18 opposite corner is preferably rounded. The tab 18 is
          thus in the longitudinal center broadest. In this range a
          simple magnetic compass is e.g. 20 attached, on the tab 18. a
          magnetic needle 22 exhibits, in addition, can every other
          magnetic display element to have. The compass 20 has a
          circular cylindrical housing and its bottom surface is on the
          tab 18 inseparably glued. Immediate adjacent to the compass 20
          a mark is 24 mounted, printed in the embodiment and now is
          important on the tab 18 that the relative position of the
          compass is a 20 24 so selected to the mark that those the
          compass axle 26 (Fig. 2) contained and plane accurate parallel
          to the bottom edge 14 of the adjacent pyramid wall 12, current
          by the mark 24, runs. In the embodiment a second mark is 24 in
          this before defined plane on the tab 18 disposed. The two
          marks 24, 24 can form also a continuous line, those the
          präzisie assembly of the compass 20 facilitated, because the
          compass center must lie on this line 24.</p>
        <p align="left"> </p>
        <p align="left"> The handling that managing described mechanism
          10 is simple. The pyramidal bodies 10 over the subject matters
          which can be loaded it is inverted which stand on a planar
          support and depending upon size of the hollow body 10 with or
          with both hands around the geometric vertical pyramid axle so
          rotated that the magnetic needle 22 with that or the marks 24
          comes to covering. The bottom edge 14 points then to north
          south direction. </p>
        <p align="left"> </p>
        <p align="left">In place of the mark 24 the adjacent scope of
          the compass 20 also a mark can be 25 on the tab 18 disposed,
          which likewise lies in the Kom passport axle 26 a contained
          vertical plane, which lies however not like the marks 24 to
          the bottom edge 14 parallel, but rectangular in addition. If
          the mark 25 becomes aligning the hollow body 10 used, then
          this so rotated becomes that the magnetic needle aligns 22
          with the mark 25. In this case the located bottom edges 16
          rectangular to the bottom edge 14 show in north south
          direction.</p>
        <p align="left"> </p>
        <p align="left">In fig 2 a modification is to that extent shown,
          when the compass 20 exhibits a housing ring 28, on that one of
          the two marks 24, 25 mounted is. With this formation the tab
          18 or a corresponding approach of the hollow body 10 does not
          need to exhibit marks.</p>
        <p align="left"> </p>
        <p align="left">The handling is the same as with the embodiment
          in accordance with fig 1.</p>
        <p align="left"> </p>
        <p align="left">In place of the mark 25 on the edge of the ring
          28 an alternative is in as much shown in fig 2 as the lid 30
          of the compass 20 exhibits a mark 25 ', which is as the
          compass axle 26 crossing radial line formed and on the lid 30
          printed or can be engraved. It understands itself that one of
          the marks for the handling is sufficient in each case. </p>

        <p align="left">While manufactured with the embodiment in
          accordance with fig 1 of the pyramidal hollow bodies 10 with
          tab 18 from cardboard is, fig 3 shows a corresponding
          pyramidal hollow body 10, which is manufactured from wood and
          which exhibits a comparatively thick walled approach 19 in the
          bottom portion of a hollow body wall 12. The bottom of the
          approach 19 is appropriate thereby in the geometric base
          surface of the hollow body 10.In for this approach 19 is a
          recess 32, is 20 so fitted into which the Kmpass that it is
          appropriate for top with the approach 19 flush. To the
          adjacent pyramid wall a groove 25 incorporated in the surface
          of the approach 19 follows 12 the recess 32, which lies again
          in that the compass axle 26 contained vertical plane, which to
          the adjacent bottom edge rectangular and to the subsequent
          bottom edges rectangular to it parallel lies.</p>
        <p align="left"> </p>
        <p align="left">In the pyramidal hollow body 10 is a bottom 34,
          which is not connected with the hollow body 10, which has
          however a pyramidenstumpfförmige shape, whose parameter
          corresponds to those of the hollow body 10, so that the base
          surface of the bottom 34 is the same inner base surface of the
          hollow body 10 and the trapezoidal side faces 36 affect the
          inner surfaces of the hollow body side panels 12 at least
          almost full-laminar. The bottom 34 has a top surface 38
          parallel to the base surface, which has a distance from the
          base surface within the range of 10% to 30% of the middle
          hollow body-high. In the embodiment the level of the top
          surface 38 on 21% of the pyramid-high lies. The bottom has the
          purpose to bring smaller subject matters which can be loaded
          with energy into the optimum effective range of the pyramidal
          hollow body. This lies within the range of 10% to
          approximately 30% pyramid-high. Although the bottom is 34
          shown as full material bodies, it understands itself that he
          can likewise consist of a down open hollow body.</p>

          bottom pyramid placed. The meat shown no decay or rot
          characteristics separate only an easier shrinkage. In the same
          way experiments with fresh milk were undertaken. Fresh milk,
          which stood longer time the bottom pyramid, shown no trace of
