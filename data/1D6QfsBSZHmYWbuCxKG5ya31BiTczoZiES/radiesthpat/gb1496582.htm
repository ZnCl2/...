        Inventor(s): &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;SACHER FRANCES VON <br>
        Also published as: NL7501808 // SE7412497 //JP50114888 //
        BR7500933 // DE2503622<br>
        <br>
        This invention relates to an energy reabsorption enhancement
        chamber.<br>
        <br>
        It is recognized that matter and energy have been theoretically
        established as being one and the same. Thus, all matter is
        capable of emitting energy and in doing so will decompose; i.e.,
        undergo a change in form. The rate at which matter will
        decompose is dependent on the internal makeup of a specific
        matter, as well as upon the external forces acting on it. For
        example, under normal conditions an organic or animated body,
        e.g., a human body, and an inanimate body, e.g., a stone or
        rock, will both decompose in time; the animated body decomposing
        at a much greater rate than the stone. The rate of decomposition
        in either case can be speeded up or slowed down by subjecting
        the respective matter to certain external forces, e.g., heat or
        cold.<br>
        <br>
        Thus, the rate of decomposition of matter can be controlled to
        some extent by influencing the internal and external forces
        acting upon a body, i.e., matter.<br>
        <br>
        A living body, e.g., a human body is constantly emitting
        cellular energy. Under normal conditions this energy has been
        determined to be the equivalent of a 100 watt light bulb. Under
        various conditions, e.g, stress, physical activity, sleep, etc.,
        the energy emitted will increase or decrease accordingly. To
        maintain the energy generated emitted by a living organic body,
        the body must be fed food to replace the vitamins, water and
        minerals required to sustain its cellular activity and continued
        emittance of cellular energy. Under normal conditions, the food
        intake of an organic body is sufficient to replenish the
        necessary life substances to delay decomposition of the body.
        However, under drastic change of condition, e.g., temperature,
        emotions and/or physical damage to the cells, it can be
        virtually impossible to replenish the life sustaining
        necessities rapidly enough.Thus, the cells eventually die of
        starvation, depletion, dehydration or physical damage.<br>
        <br>
        An object of this invention is to provide a physical structure
        which will enhance the reabsorption of the energy emitted by a
        body, i.e., matter be it organic or inorganic.<br>
        <br>
        Another object is to provide a structure capable of effecting
        the retention and reabsorption of emitted cellular energy by a
        body.<br>
        <br>
        Another object is to provide a physical structure in which the
        reabsorption of the energy emitted by a body can be varied by
        the stimulation of an external energy force on the body.<br>
        <br>
        Another object is to provide a structure which will naturally
        influence matter so as to retard the decomposition thereof.<br>
        <br>
        Another object is to provide a physical structure capable of
        minimizing the loss of cellular energy which a body emits.<br>
        <br>
        Another object is to provide a physical structure which is
        relatively simple in construction and which can be readily
        fabricated of any suitable rigid material.<br>
        <br>
        According to the present invention there is provided a chamber
        for receiving a body whereby energy emitted by said body can in
        part be reabsorbed thereby, which chamber comprises a plurality
        of triangular side walls connected to one another along their
        adjacent edges to define a chamber which is pyramidal in
        configuration, a reflective surface being disposed on the
        interior side of the side walls of the chamber for inhibiting
        the escape of energy emitted by the body, when disposed in the
        chamber, and for deflecting the emitted energy inhibited from
        escaping to the body to be reabsorbed thereby, and a support
        platform centrally disposed within the chamber interior, the
        platform having a supporting surface located at a level such
        that the plane at that level divides the internal volume of the
        chamber into approximately equal parts, the supporting surface
        supporting the body thereon, when the chamber is in use, for
        optimum reabsorption of the energy inhibited from escaping.<br>
        <br>
        According to an embodiment of the invention there is provided a
        treatment chamber comprising a quadrilateral base member having
        equal side edges, there being a triangular side wall connected
        to each of the edges and extending upwardly therefrom to define
        an apex, the side walls being connected along their respective
        adjacent side edges to define a pyramidshaped closed chamber and
        each of the side walls having the shape of an isosceles
        triangle, a reflective surface lining disposed on the internal
        wall surfaces of the side walls, the chamber having an altitude
        equal to approximately the perimeter of the base member divided
        by 27r, a support platform centrally disposed relative to the
        floor of the chamber and having a top surface located at an
        elevation which divides the internal volume of the chamber into
        two equal parts, means defining an access opening to the
        interior of the chamber and means for closing the access
        opening.<br>
        <br>
        With a body or matter located on the platform, the arrangement
        is such that the emitted internal energy of whatever molecular
        condition will return to the centre of the internal volume of
        the chamber where it can be reabsorbed by the body. The rate of
        reabsorption can be intensified or varied by the introduction of
        an external energy force, such as stimulating light and/or
        sound, into the defined chamber. "External" in this context
        refers to a source additional to the energy source which is the
        body itself.<br>
        <br>
        Subject to the disclaimer which appears hereinafter, the
        invention also provides a method of enhancing the reabsorption
        of energy by a body emitting such energy, which method comprises
        positioning the body on the support platform within a chamber in
        accordance with the invention.<br>
        <br>
        The invention will now be further illustrated and described with
        reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:~<br>
        <br>

        <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="gb1496582a.jpg"
            alt=""></div>
        <br>
        Referring to the drawings, there is shown in Figures 1 and 2 a
        preferred embodiment of a chamber in accordance with the
        invention, designated by reference numeral 10. As shown, the
        preferred embodiment comprises a chamber 10 formed of a
        plurality of triangularly shaped side walls 11 which are joined
        along their adjacent side edges I IA to define an apex 12. In
        the illustrated form, four such side walls 11 are connected to
        define a pyramid-shaped chamber 10. While four such side walls
        11 are shown, it will be understood that more than four side
        walls may be joined to define the chamber 10. If desired, the
        side walls 11 may be connected to a base member 13 to define a
        chamber floor. In the illustrated embodiment, the base member 13
        is a quadrilaterally-shaped member, preferably defined as a
        square.Depending upon application, the side walls 11 may be
        formed of any suitable material, e.g. wood, glass, metal,
        plastics, stiff paper, cardboard and the like. In the
        illustrated embodiment, the opposite side edges I IA of the
        respective sides are equal so that the side wall is defined as
        an isosceles triangle.<br>
        <br>
        At least a portion of each internal surface of the respective
        side walls 11 is covered with a reflecting surface 14, e.g., a
        mirror to reflect the emitted energy of an object or matter M
        disposed within the chamber 10.<br>
        <br>
        In the illustrated embodiment, the entire internal surfaces of
        the respective side walls 11 are covered by such reflective
        surfaces 14.<br>
        <br>
        Disposed within the chamber there is provided a support or
        platform 15 adapted to support an object, body, or matter M.<br>
        <br>
        Preferably the top of the platform is disposed parallel to the
        base at a level which is such that a plane at that height above
        the base would divide the internal volume V of the chamber 10
        into two approximately equal parts.<br>
        <br>
        It has been determined that the chamber 10 may assume any
        proportions depending upon the specific application. However,
        for optimum results, it is preferred that the altitude A of the
        apex or top of the chamber 10 be made approximately equal to the
        perimeter of the base divided by 27r or 6.2832, or any
        equivalent fractional application of the base perimeter divided
        by 27r ratio defined.<br>
        <br>
        If desired the chamber 10 may be provided with an acces opening
        16 to facilitate the placing and/or removal of any object or
        body therefrom. An appropriate closure or door 17 is provided to
        close the opening 16 when the chamber 10 is to be used. The
        configuration of the internal walls 11 and the covering
        reflecting surfaces 14 has, for reasons unknown, a direct
        influence on the free flowing movement and defraction,
        magnification or reflection of external structural molecular,
        cellular, sub-atomic, and/or atomic waves emitted by a body or
        matter M, and which results in the emitti#ng body M to reabsorb
        its own energy and thereby retard any natural decomposition
        thereof.<br>
        <br>
        While the chamber 10 defined enhances the reabsorption of the
        emitted bodily energy into the emitting body M, the rate of
        reabsorption can be intensified or varied by the introduction of
        an external energy force, e.g., that of a stimulating light
        and/or sound into the chamber 10. This can be readily achieved
        by the positioning of a light source, e.g., an electric lighting
        device 20 within the chamber 10. In the illustrated embodiment
        the light source 20 may be located in the vicinity of the apex
        or the top of the chamber 10. Also, various indirect lighting
        effects may be utilized whereby the intensity, colour and/or
        frequency thereof can be controlled to produce various
        psychodelic effects to stimulate or diminish the emitted energy
        of the body accordingly.<br>
        <br>
        To a similar extent, sound maybe employed to vary the rate a
        body emits its energy. As shown, the sound producing means in
        the form of sound emitting speakers 21 are centrally positioned.
        It will be understood that the speakers 21 may be connected in
        circuit with a suitable sound transmitting source. In the
        illustrated embodiment, the speakers 21 are disposed in the
        platform so that the sound can emanate in all directions. By
        controlling the intensity, colour, and/or frequency of the light
        and/or sound to produce the various visual and/or audio effects
        that can be created thereby, the amount of energy emitted by a
        body can be varied. In turn, the amount of energy which the body
        can reabsorb can be varied accordingly.<br>
        <br>
        While the invention has been described with respect to a
        particular embodiment, it will be readily appreciated and
        understood that variations and modifications may be<br>
        made without departing from the scope of the invention.<br>
        <br>
        Insofar as the present invention includes within its scope a
        method of enhancing the reabsorption of energy by a body
        emitting such energy, which method comprises positioning the
        body on the support platform within a chamber in accordance -
        with the invention, it should be clearly understood that we make
        no claim herein to such a method when employed in the treatment
        or prevention of disease in human beings.<br>
