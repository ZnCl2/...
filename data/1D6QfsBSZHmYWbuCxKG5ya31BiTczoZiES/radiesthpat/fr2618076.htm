      Inventor: BOURGOUIN DOMINIQUE [FR] ; DACIER CHRISTOPHE [FR]<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract</span> -- The invention
      relates to a device allowing the emission of wave forms which are
      beneficial for all living things. It consists of a set of
      geometrical shapes whose arrangement generates a symbolic
      application and gives rise to the appearance of powerful emissions
      which are beneficial for all living beings. The device according
      to the invention is in particular intended for creating a
      beneficial vibrational field.<br>
      <br>
      The invention relates to an apparatus whose forms are to 1 '
      origin of its emissions, its radiation is very powerful and
      beneficial.<br>
      <br>
      The waves of forms are recognized more and more and their effects
      are completely verifiable scientifically. Already, various
      apparatuses emitting of the waves of forms were described by
      specialists like i9.Chaumery, Mr. of Bélizal and M.Jean de LaFoye
      and the works of study are done increasingly many with this
      subject.<br>
      <br>
      Our apparatus was tràs- studied following the science of the waves
      of forms as well as numerology. Thus its proportions and its forms
      produce a very beneficial radiation.<br>
      <br>
      In its application, the shapes of the apparatus are transcribed
      using a metallic conductive support. The technical ones used into
      electronic for the manufacture of the printed circuits can be used
      in the performing of our apparatus. In this case the metal used is
      copper. But the amalgam of several metals can reinforce the
      effects of the apparatus. In the form of printed circuit, the
      apparatus is protected by a tinning which avoids the oxidation of
      copper.<br>
      <br>
      Our apparatus can have various uses: in the field of the
      geobiology, our apparatus can-Stre regarded as a vibrational
      reequilibror. it neutralizes harmfulnesses of a habitat for
      example, by rebalancing.<br>
      <br>
      This vibrational rebalancing improves the health and the wellbeing
      of the living beings.<br>
      <br>
      In the field of the magnetism; the radiation of our apparatus is
      comparable with the magnetism. 11 water, drinks, foods placed at
      70 cm of the apparatus are loaded and their biotic quality is
      increased. The conservation of the fresh products is improved by
      it. Persons, animals or plants placed close to the apparatus are
      revitalize. it is also possible to cause dessications of bodies
      dead, animals or vegetal.<br>
      <br>
      The annexed drawing illustrates the invention. We have an antenna
      with three branches B, C, C, which are placed respectively at 600,
      900, 1080 of the axis XI y'. In the extension of axis X y, we have
      an assembly of 4 circles E, which connect<br>
      F the triangle; These 4 circles have a longueure identical with
      those of the antennas, proportion 44. The triangle has its apex in
      contact with axis X there as with the base of the 4 circles. Its
      height is of 2A. Its base is of 10A with ltexterior and 7,77A to 1
      ' inner. Its base is feedthrough in its center by axis X Y.<br>
      <br>
      With the lower part of the triangle F, we find another assembly of
      circle to the number of 5, G. In these assemblies E and G, the
      diameter of the circles are of 1A. G is crossed in its longueure
      by axis X y, it connects F to H. H is a polygon with 16 with
      dimensions in its outer appearance. Its diameter is of 1osa. Its
      thickness is of 0,77A. In its inner appearance H is a circle of
      diameter 9,22A. H contains in its inner I and 3. I is an
      equilateral triangle contenut in the inner one of H. Its apex is
      placed on axis X Y. 3 is a circle whose center is the same one
      that that of H. Its periphery is in contact with the with
      dimensions ones of I. J contains square superimposed of a triangle
      K.<br>
      <br>
      The triangle K with the same orientation that I and square K has
      diagonal in axis X Y. The equilateral triangle K is connected by
      its angles at the center of circle 3.<br>
      <br>
      With the lower part in axis X y, we find K' which is a circle of
      7A of diameter. This one contains L which is square of 4,44A of
      with dimensions. One of diagonal of L is in axis X Y. L contains
      another square M of 2,33A of with dimensions. M is placed at the
      center of L and two of its with dimensions are parallel with axis
      X Y.<br>
      <br>
      The apparatus in its height made 32A. The thickness does not owe
      exéder 0,33A except for H.<br>
      <br>
      Of metallic constitution, the apparatus in accordance with the
      invention is a wave transmitter of beneficial forms. <br>
