        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract</span> -- Device for
        harmonising a location. The invention relates to a device for
        obtaining or re-establishing maximum vibrational harmony of a
        location. It consists of a cube 1 surmounted by three
        hemispheres 2 which can move around a vertical axis 3.
        Twenty-four "runes" 4 are pyrographed on each hemisphere. The
        device according to the invention is intended in particular for
        general harmonisation working towards maintaining plants,
        animals and human beings in "good health" in the place in which
        they live. <br>

        INTRODUCTION - the idea of the focus of this Harmonisateur d'
        Ambiance is in relationship with the theory of the emissions
        which had with the forms and, with the properties of the
        ideograms in general -, of the signs runic in particular in this
        presentation.<br>
        <br>
        With regard to the emissions which had with the forms us sums
        left the principle that: “All that exists in the universe rayon
        and emits vibrations”. So the emissions which had with the forms
        have an influence on the living cell, incoming in resonance with
        it -, that these forms natural or are built hand of the man.<br>
        <br>
        For what has stroke with the use of the signs expressing an idea
        -, we consider that the older the use of the ideogram is -, the
        more it has acquired power.<br>
        <br>
        We have for this selected model Runes ( 24 Runes being presented
        in three sequences of 8 Runes). However -, the support hardware
        of the Ambiance Harmonizer can receive the signs of all the
        systems ideographic of planet, including the alphabets and
        sign-symbols of all civilizations.<br>
        <br>
        The drawing of the inscribed ideogram in a frame with the
        proportions of square long.<br>
        <br>
        It is thus of the combination of the forms and the ideograms
        that taken birth the construction of Ambience Harmonizer has by
        applicant the fundamental bases of the old measuring in respect
        between them in the structures of the object considered.<br>
        <br>
        Harmonisateur d' Ambiance present in original version consisted
        a surmounted cubet of three hemispheres with same diameter that
        the side of the cube. Are the three hemisphères movable around
        an&nbsp; vertical axis. The unit is out of appropriate wood and
        of gasoline chosen according to the particular need. It is not
        excluded that I'4? arynoni#a##r can be built in all other
        materials.<br>
        <br>
        On each demi.sphère are pyrographed the 24 Runes#) displacement
        thanks to the vertical axis makes it possible to put Runes,
        selected at the time of the specific study, in correspondence.<br>
        <br>
        The unit to be operational must be directed and controlled
        according to technical particular that we can call “Put in
        vibrations<br>
        <br>
        USE - One of the main functions of Ambience Harmonizer is to
        restore the vibrational balance when it is compromised in the
        places where the human being saw -, works, studies, etc<br>
        <br>
        The Ambience Harmonizer finds also its application for the
        vegetal world and animal.<br>
        <br>
        It thus will be a question, using Harmonisateur d' Ambiance to
        bring or bring back gradually the harmony between the place and
        the living structures occupant this space.<br>
        <br>
        The object in oneself can quite simply be neutral or, to present
        disadvantages -, if a competent technician were not loaded to
        position it properly, like calculating the duration of the
        operation and the phases of re-establishment.<br>
        <br>
        Many other uses are possible -, for therapeutists in general -,
        however -, we will not go into the detail of these multiple
        possibilities.<br>
        <br>
        The paramount interest of this Harmonisateur d' Ambiance is to
        be able to intervene on three planes -, physical -, psychic and
        spiritual -, and this, without us to bring to disgresser on the
        semantic one of this terminology.<br>
        <br>
        CONCLUSION - let us toquons simply in connection with Runes that
        initially, “Rune is an energy qualitatively and quantitatively
        determined.<br>
        <br>
        It is represented by a conventional sign which we assimilate by
        spirit of simplification to an ideogram. It is characterized by
        a name which accurate its fundamental nature and its prototypic
        direction.<br>
        <br>
        This prototypic direction contains all the analogue directions
        and synonyms which refer to the “Rune”.<br>
        <br>
        In addition “- that the absolute Universe is of energetic nature
        -, that the harmful, i.e. opposite energies with the direction
        of the movement of the absolute Universe, are anéantissables, in
        other words, that they carry in them the germ of their own
        destruction and that they start the irreversible process of them
        -, that as the disorder increases, the connections now the
        relative structures break the ones after the others by releasing
        the energetic quanta in parallel corresponding one and, the
        system ending up losing more energy than it collects some,
        weakens by condemning the disturbances which it causes to
        proportionally lose of their width until total disappearance….”<br>
        <br>
        It rises from what precedes, “that an harmful energy, not only
        autodétruit, but that it is fought and destroyed by the
        neighbouring healthy energies, immunized against its reachings
        and according to a mechanism of natural defense” (extracted
        Sciences Runiques - Rudolf K. Vogel - 1984).<br>
        <br>
        Harmonisateur d' Ambiance is used as detonator with the process
        of disappearance of the perturbing energies by starting by its
        own force ~ the phase of destruction (of the causal energies)<br>
        -, the phase of depletion (of the disturbances by blanking of
        new energetic contributions)<br>
        the phase of cover (by return with normal).<br>
        <br>
        Once the operation of harmonization carried out, the harmonic
        stabilization of the place considered appears acquired without
        maintaining in place Harmonisateur d' Ambiance for somewhat that
        there is no notorious change, neither in the adjustment of the
        built place -, nor in the component of its occupants.<br>
        <br>
        Results obtained to date being encouraging -, the
        experimentation and the use of Harmonisateur d' Ambiance
        continue.<br>
        <br>
        Of other forms with runic inscriptions are tested.<br>
        <br>
        Power and span of Harmonisateur d' Ambiance are tested according
        to models having different characteristics of volume and weight.
