      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract --</span> The present
      invention includes an apparatus and method for generating,
      duplicating, and transmitting biophotonic radio frequencies that
      propagate along the atmospheric boundary layer of the human skin
      and the earth's atmosphere. These biophotonic radio frequencies
      are applied to a human patient for therapeutic purposes. This
      function is realized with the use of a series of oscillators
      (i.e., electronic function generators) designed to produce
      modulated or unmodulated sine and square wave photons. The
      oscillators are further adapted to emit the modulated or
      unmodulated sine and square wave photons from a dielectric or
      metal antenna built as loops into the walls of a
      diamagnetic-paramagnetic chamber. When a person is seated in the
      chamber, the photons of energy from the waves generated along the
      loop antenna penetrate the human body and provide a variety of
      therapeutic benefits. Among these therapeutic benefits are relief
      of rheumatic muscular pain, slowing the metabolism, increasing the
      efficiency of the immune system, eliminating certain psychosomatic
      ailments, and suppressing cancer.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">1. Field of the Invention</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The present invention relates generally to an electronic photonic
      method and apparatus for using natural radio frequencies for
      therapeutic purposes, and more particularly, a system and method
      for generating a highly amplified radio signal comprising
      extremely low frequency or very low frequency radio signals for
      feedback into the human body for therapeutic purposes.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">2. Discussion of Related Art</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The present invention described herein is based on the early work
      of Snape, d'Arsonval, Rabinovitch, and Leduc. In particular, Snape
      pioneered the use of extremely low radio frequencies (ELF) as an
      anesthetic in dental extraction (Snape, J., On electricity as an
      anesthetic in dental extractions, Trans. Odont. Soc. Gr. Brit.,
      pp. 287-312. (1869)). Subsequently, in 1890, Arsine d'Arsonval
      demonstrated that ELF pulsed electrical currents, ranging from
      2500 Hz to 10,000 Hz, induced general anesthesia in humans.
      Similarly, in 1902, Leduc demonstrated that a pulsed electrical DC
      current applied to the central nervous system could effectively
      induce anesthesia. Rabinovitch did extensive work in the area of
      electric analgesia sleep and resuscitation (Rabinovitch, L. G.,
      Electric Analgesia Sleep and Resuscitation Anesthesia (chap. XVI),
      ed. J. T. Gwatheny. D. Appleton &amp; Co., New York, pp. 628-643
      (1914)). More recently, Czaja demonstrated that treatment in the
      ELF frequency range enhances the immune system (Czaja, W.,
      Comparative Studies of Electro-analgesia and Barbiturates, Polski
      Archirum Weterynaryjne, pp. 205-224 (1986)).<br>
      <br>
      Between 1965 and 1973 Applicant demonstrated that antennae
      sensilla on insects act as photonic waveguides to collect and
      transmit infrared frequencies. From this early research, Applicant
      postulated that living systems (e.g., insect spines and plant
      fibers) also utilize the radio portion of the frequency spectrum
      to energize photons from radio and infrared emitting molecules.
      The requirement for detecting and or stimulating infrared and
      radio emissions from living systems is the ELF modulation of the
      organic and gaseous interface located at the waxy surface of the
      system. That is, living systems store coherent photon emissions
      from the external environment which become part of the
      self-organization of the living system. It has been demonstrated
      that ELF frequencies in living systems range from 10@3 Hz in nerve
      action potentials to 10@-2 Hz for physiological functions.<br>
      <br>
      Based on these principles, Applicant has determined that radio
      waves in the ELF region of the radio spectrum are propagated along
      the atmospheric boundary layer of the human skin. ELF in the range
      of 800 Hz to 5200 Hz averaging 1000 Hz, with narrowband 10,000 Hz
      to 150,000 Hz sideband ELF radio signals are natural to the skin
      surface. The 700 Hz to 10,000 Hz region of the frequency spectrum
      is the region of so called radio "whistlers" (i.e. radio signals)
      from atmospheric lightning strikes around the world. It is this
      atmospheric electricity that modulates the frequencies from the
      atmospheric boundary layer of the skin. These modulation
      frequencies are equivalent to the 3 Hz to 40 Hz oscillations
      discovered by W. O. Schumann stimulated by lightning. These
      flicker modulations (which are approximately 3 Hz to 6 Hz) can be
      observed on an oscilloscope while measuring the 1000 Hz and 10,000
      sidebands present on the human skin.<br>
      <br>
      In 1952, Schumann calculated the atmospheric cavity resonance
      between the earth and ionosphere as being in the low ELF region
      (e.g., 1 to 40 Hz). In 1962 H. L. Koening measured these photonic
      radio waves and pointed out that some of them fall in the same
      region as human EEG frequencies between 0.5 and 3 Hz. In 1974 M.
      A. Persinger found ELF field effects on mammals and persons. A
      summary of the therapeutic effects of ELF is given in Ehrmann et
      al., "Influence of Altering Magnetic Fields [Frequencies Between 1
      and 20 Hz] on Psychosomatic Ailments", presented at the second
      Bioclimatological Colloquium (1976).<br>
      <br>
      The above work deals with the effect of radio frequencies on the
      diseased body. However, these articles do not consider the
      modulation of waves by lower frequencies or the wave form of the
      treatment frequencies. Nor do they contemplate a specific
      environment for applying radio frequencies to the diseased body
      for therapeutic purposes.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE
        INVENTION</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      These and other advances concerning electricity and its effect
      upon living systems, as well as the discovery that radio waves in
      the ELF region are propagated along the atmospheric boundary layer
      of the human skin are utilized by the present invention. The
      present invention includes an apparatus and method for generating
      the biophotonic radio frequencies that propagate along the
      atmospheric boundary layer of the human skin. The present
      invention further includes a method and apparatus for using these
      radio frequencies for therapeutic purposes. In addition, exact
      human-atmospheric, stone, sand, and plant frequency ranges, their
      modulation parameters, and their exact waveforms are elucidated
      herein.<br>
      <br>
      These functions are realized with the use of a series of
      oscillators (i.e., electronic function generators) designed to
      produce modulated sine wave and square-like wave photons wave
      photons. The oscillators are further adapted to emit the modulated
      sine and square wave photons from a dielectric or metal antenna
      built as loops into the walls of a diamagnetic-paramagnetic
      chamber. When a person is seated in the chamber, the photons of
      energy from the waves generated along the loop antenna penetrate
      the human body and provide a variety of therapeutic effects. Among
      these therapeutic effects are relief of rheumatic muscular pain,
      slowing the metabolism, increasing the efficiency of the immune
      system, eliminating certain psychosomatic ailments, and
      suppressing cancer.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED
        EMBODIMENTS</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Radio waves in the Extremely Low Frequency (ELF) and Very Low
      Frequency (VLF) region are propagated along the atmospheric
      boundary layer of the human or mammalian skin, rock surfaces, sod
      (soil), and plants (in particular trees). These radio waves occur
      between 0.5 Hz and 20,000 Hz in the Schumann, electrical
      anesthesia, and electronic induction portion of the
      electromagnetic spectrum. Furthermore, these radio waves sometimes
      show narrow 10,000 Hz to 20,000 Hz narrow sidebands that vary from
      person to person, plant to plant, etc., due to the health of the
      living animal or plant, the time of day, and the weather
      conditions. The highest peak of these emissions occurs at dawn and
      dusk (i.e. between 0630 to 0930 hrs and from 1830 to 2130 hrs). In
      other words, these radio waves tend to increase in amplitude
      during these peak dawn and dusk times.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 1(A) shows a front sectional view of a treatment chamber 10
      constructed in accordance with the present invention. FIG. 1(B)
      shows a top sectional view of the treatment chamber 10. The
      treatment chamber 10 is built in a hexagon shape of Navajo hogan
      design. The treatment chamber can be built to any dimensions so
      long as a human can comfortably sit in the treatment chamber 10
      without making contact with the walls of the treatment chamber 10.
      A recommended size is 8 feet by 8 feet. In a preferred embodiment,
      the treatment chamber 10 is made of wooden logs or architect
      square logs each of which are approximately six inches thick. Wood
      is used because it is an excellent diamagnetic material (i.e., it
      is repelled by a magnetic field). In other words, the treatment
      chamber 10 is constructed from a material that helps insulate the
      patient sitting in the treatment chamber 10 from outside magnetic
      forces.<br>
      <br>
      The treatment chamber 10 has a roof 20 constructed from corbled
      logs and/or wood. The entire treatment chamber 10 is covered with
      paramagnetic earth (200 centimeter-grams, per second (cgs) or
      above--cgs defined generally as the amount of time one gram of a
      material will move towards a magnet placed one centimeter away).
      The earth mound is sodded with a living grass. The treatment
      chamber 10 could also be covered with bricks instead of earth so
      long as the bricks are paramagnetic. In other words, the treatment
      chamber can be covered by any material that is paramagnetic. The
      floor of the treatment chamber 10 is constructed from hardened
      compact clay or earth. The floor is also covered with a wool
      carpet 95 since wool does not store a magnetic charge.<br>
      <br>
      The configuration of the treatment chamber 10 provides a layered
      system since the earth covering is paramagnetic and the wood is
      diamagnetic. In this document the term paramagnetic is defined as
      a material that is susceptible to magnetism. The material does not
      store the magnetic force, rather if brought in contact with a
      magnet it would be drawn towards it. Diamagnetic is the opposite.
      A diamagnetic material is repelled by a magnet. Diamagnetic
      materials also do not store a magnetic force.<br>
      <br>
      Experiments by the Applicant in volcanic areas with paramagnetic
      soil (e.g., Ireland) and in diamagnetic areas with little or no
      soil (e.g., Upper Amazon) have shown that a combination of a
      diamagnetic layer (e.g., plant material) and a paramagnetic layer
      (e.g., volcanic earth or clay brick) tend to focus or concentrate
      the radio waves (describe below) that are introduced into the
      treatment chamber 10. It appears that diamagnetic-paramagnetic
      layers act as a condenser for storing and discharging the ELF and
      VLF energy.<br>
      <br>
      An antenna loop 30 is imbedded in the wall of the treatment
      chamber 10. The antenna loop 30 is formed from thin copper wire or
      of 1/4 inch hemp rope which has been soaked for one day in a sea
      salt solution. Other materials that could be used to construct the
      antenna loop would be apparent to a person skilled in the relevant
      art.<br>
      <br>
      The antenna loop 30 encircles the treatment chamber 10 within a
      diamagnetic fiberboard wall 40. The antenna loop 30 is spaced with
      the individual loops one inch apart from floor to ceiling.<br>
      <br>
      The leads from the antenna loop 30 are passed through the
      fiberboard wall 40 and connected to a wave generator 50. FIG. 2
      shows a block diagram of the wave generator 50. The wave generator
      50 includes an oscillator 55 (oscillator 55 is also referred to as
      a function generator), an amplifier 60, an arbitrary function
      generator 70, a mixer 80, and a computer 90. Each of these
      components will now be described in detail.<br>
      <br>
      The arbitrary function generator 70 is controlled by the computer
      90. The arbitrary function generator 70 is an instrument which
      generates periodic waveforms that duplicate various types of
      defined mathematical functions. In other words, the arbitrary
      function generator 70 is computer programmable to duplicate any
      known frequency or waveform. Function generators are well known in
      the art, and for the sake of brevity, the programming and
      operation of the arbitrary function generator 70 will not be
      described in detail here. In operation, a user programs the
      computer 90 to provide a particular waveform to the arbitrary
      function generator 70. The arbitrary function generator 70
      duplicates the waveform provided by the computer 70 and produces
      waveform S1.<br>
      <br>
      In an alternate embodiment, an antenna 65 is connected directly to
      the arbitrary function generator 70. As discussed above, there are
      a variety of radio waves that are natural to the atmosphere. The
      present invention is based on the theory that these natural waves,
      if applied in an amplified form to the human body, can provide
      therapeutic benefits. Thus, the antenna 65 can be connected
      directly to the function generator 70, which in turn duplicates
      the exact waveform of the radio waves that are propagating within
      the atmosphere. The preferred antenna used for detecting these
      natural radio waves can be found in a patent application filed
      Apr. 19, 1993, in the name of Dr. Philip S. Callahan, entitled
      "Photonic Ionic Cord Detector of Group Waves" U.S. patent
      application Ser. No. 08/047,486, which is hereby incorporated by
      reference in its entirety.<br>
      <br>
      The arbitrary function generator 70 is connected to the amplifier
      60. Amplifiers are very well known, and for the sake of brevity a
      detailed description of the amplifier 60 will not be given. The
      amplifier 60 amplifies the waveform S1 produced by the arbitrary
      function generator 70. The amplifier 60 produces amplified
      waveform S2. The amplifier 60 is connected to the oscillator 55
      which stabilizes the amplified waveform S2. Note that the
      amplifier 60 can be connected directly to the antenna 30, but the
      waveform might not be as stable.<br>
      <br>
      The oscillator 55 is connected to the antenna 30. Thus, the
      duplicated amplified waveform is provided to the antenna 30. These
      waveforms are transmitted into the treatment chamber 10 by the
      antenna 30. It is these waveforms that provide therapeutic
      benefits.<br>
      <br>
      The waveform S1 can take many forms, including a sine wave or a
      sine wave riding another sine wave. The first signal S1 is
      typically a modulated millivolt signal. The modulated millivolt
      signal is amplified by the amplifier 60 up to volt ranges.<br>
      <br>
      It has been determined by Applicant that the natural radio waves
      that propagate throughout the atmosphere, as well as the natural
      waves that propagate along the surface of the human body if
      amplified and provided to a diseased body can aid in the treatment
      of diseases or medical ailments. Consequently, it is these natural
      radio waves that should be duplicated and generated by the
      arbitrary function generator 70. Some of these waveforms are
      described briefly below.<br>
      <br>
      FIGS. 3(A) through 3(H) illustrate eight different exemplary
      waveforms (i.e., radio waves) that can be produced by the
      arbitrary function generator 70. All eight radio waves occur
      naturally in the atmosphere or along the surface of the human
      body. The computer 90 is programmed by a user to generate the
      desired waveform. Such programming would be apparent to a person
      skilled in the relevant art based on the following description of
      exemplary waveforms. As discussed above, this waveform is
      duplicated by the arbitrary function generator 70. These signals
      are described briefly below.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 3A illustrates an unmodulated waveform. The unmodulated
      waveform can have resonant peaks at 4, 8, 14 or 28 Herts (Hz).
      FIG. 3B illustrates a modulated 2,000 Hz sine wave carried on a 4
      to 8 Hz sine wave. FIG. 3C illustrates a modulated 100 Hz sine
      wave carried on a 4 Hz sine wave. FIG. 3D illustrates a modulated
      600 Hz square wave carried on a 120 Hz sine wave. FIG. 3E
      illustrates a modulated 8700 Hz sine wave with 20,000 Hz spikes
      generated and carried randomly along its fixed frequency. FIG. 3F
      illustrates a modulated 600 Hz grounded square wave with 20,000 Hz
      spikes generated and carried randomly along its fixed frequency.
      FIG. 3G illustrates a soliton target or group waves, of a very
      specific form, varying between 0.5 Hz and 1000 Hz with a band gap
      of between 1 Hz and 10 Hz in the middle as given in FIG. 4.<br>
      <br>
      A group wave is the sum of many phase waves. For a more derailed
      discussion of group waves see Brillouin and Sommerfield, Wave
      Propagation and Group Velocity, Academic Press, New York, 1960.
      These radio waves have been so named because the varying group
      wave frequencies modulate a basic phase Schumann wave. Note that
      Schumann waves vary with geographic region. Since a soliton is a
      wave riding another wave and the varying group wave between 0.5 Hz
      to 170 Hz is superimposed (frequency modulates) on the standard
      geographical Schumann wave. The soliton is considered by Applicant
      to be a special sum group (sometimes called target waves) of the
      natural unpolluted atmosphere. (See Allowiz and Segur, Solitons
      and Inverse Scattering Transform, Siam Publishers, Philadelphia,
      1981.) The radio group soliton waves have recently been discovered
      by Applicant in nature. In a preferred embodiment, the wave
      generator 70 is programmed by computer 90 to duplicate and
      generate the soliton group wave (see FIG. 4) since Applicant
      believes this wave provides the most beneficial therapeutic
      effects.<br>
      <br>
      The amplifier 60 may be connected to a plurality of arbitrary
      function generators 70 each producing a different waveform S1. A
      first switch 65 is provided so that one of the signals S1 or a
      mixed signal S3 can be selected and fed into the amplifier 60. A
      second switch (not shown) is provided to allow multiple waveforms
      S1 to be input into the mixer 80.<br>
      <br>
      The mixer 80 is capable of producing a variety of different
      signals that are deviations from the waveforms S1. Note that if
      the mixer 80 is used the first switch (not shown) does not select
      a waveform S1 from the arbitrary function generators 70. The mixer
      80 emits single or mixtures of the duplicated waveforms emitted by
      the arbitrary function generators 70. This mixed waveform is
      labeled S3. The emitted waveform S3 from the mixer 80 is provided
      to the amplifier 60. Note that the signals from the arbitrary
      function generators 70 do not have to pass through the mixer 80.
      Rather the signals from the arbitrary function generator 70 can
      be, and most frequently are, passed directly to the amplifier 60.<br>
      <br>
      The treatment chamber 10 should be located at least 1/2 mile from
      an AC power source (60 Hz or greater). The wave generator 50
      should be DC battery operated.<br>
      <br>
      The preferred means for the patient to absorb the therapeutic
      frequencies is to sit in the center of the treatment chamber 10
      without contacting the surrounding loop antenna (i.e., without
      contacting the surrounding walls of the treatment chamber). Thus,
      only the atmospheric-skin boundary frequencies emitted by the loop
      antenna 30 are absorbed by the patient. The wave generator 50 is
      tuned depending on the specific therapeutic treatment. The tuning
      of the wave generator 50 is based on previously proven wave forms
      (see Ehrmann cited above), or by experimentation.<br>
      <br>
      In short, the treatment chamber 10 is imitating nature but in a
      more amplified manner. By providing an environment that contains
      an atmosphere that is saturated with amplified radio signals that
      are natural (i.e., propagate within the earths atmosphere or along
      the surface of the human body), the patient can obtain a
      significant therapeutic benefit.<br>
      <br>
      An alternate method of using the teachings of the present
      invention is to feed the radio waves that are output from the
      antenna 30 directly into the human body by grounding the feet and
      placing the antenna lead in one hand of the patient.<br>
      <br>
      While the invention has been particularly shown and described with
      reference to preferred embodiments thereof, it will be understood
      by those skilled in the art that the foregoing and other changes
      in form and details may be made therein without departing from the
      spirit and scope of the invention.<br>
