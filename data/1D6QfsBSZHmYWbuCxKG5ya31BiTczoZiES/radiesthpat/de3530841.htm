        </span>The invention relates to the arrangement from rectal
        electrodes and connectors to an CHAKRA ELECTRODE for positive
        life-promoting energetic Pehandlungen at the 1enschen, in
        particular 5 - keit for the Chakra treatment, as well as the
        energy decrement possible with use of Pyrabiden energien for the
        set friction of the CHAKRA ELECTRODE over a pyramid cup
        electrode and/or a pyramid probe and/or over pyramid surface
        electrodes and/or over a pyramid right parallelepiped electrode
        and/or over 10 - a pyramid electrode and/or over point of
        pyramid electrodes.<br>
        <br>
        Due to a lecture with demonstration to 17. June 1985 on the
        occasion of a colloquium of the MORA society in 813Starnberg is
        known that itself pyramid energies over 9 planar with 15 -
        assistance of a shielded metal cup, which becomes set on the
        pyramid, caught - and over insulated:: Netall cable away-passed
        - and among other things over a rectal electrode to the
        treatment of Chakren at the Ken used will can.<br>
        <br>
        The energetic treatment of the body with only a Rektal 20 -
        electrode has the disadvantage that treatment successes at the
        humans obtain themselves only in a substantial longer time rest,
        than this with the help of several summarized rectal electrodes
        possible is, whereby treatments with simultaneous several
        separate kinds of energy are not possible.<br>
        <br>
        The invention is the basis the object to manufacture an
        electrode with their assistance itself rapid and light energies
        in and/or. on the human body bringing leave and in particular
        for the treatment of the Chakren at the humans by pyramid, color
        and/or other positive lebensfreund30 - lichen energies is
        suitable and with their assistance targeted single and/or
        several planes of the diverting pyramid energy, as well as human
        body-own energies, color energies and other positive energies
        separate and in combination used to become to be able and with
        their assistance it possible is, Ener 35 - gien themselves at
        the humans again to take off, so that energy over dosages light
        balanced to become to be able.<br>
        <br>
        This object becomes according to invention dissolved by the fact
        that Rekt2l electrodes - like it z.P. by the HANS'S BRÜGEMANN
        INSTITUTE Postfach. 1105, D-8035 Gauting based to become to be
        able - corresponding drawing sheet 1 embodiment A1 to A7 so
        disposed and zu5 - to be SAM-mix-added that they form a unit, in
        which each electrode of the other so insulated and connected is
        that you can divert the supplied energies only over its front
        retal lischen part, oit it is mölich, energies to; ; lenschen by
        plumb bob-fair guide of the CHAKRA ELECTRODE on 10 - and/or. to
        bring into its body and take off by parallel guide of the CHAKRA
        ELECTRODE to the frontal one of the planar human body energies
        again, so that energy overdosing again light balanced to become
        to be able, whereby the power connections to the CHAKRA
        ELECTRODE with use of the pyramid energy ent15 - speaking
        connection diagram sheet 2 made will should.<br>
        The advantages achievable with the invention consist in
        particular of it - that the energetic F'ehandlungszeiten
        substantial can be shortened, 20 - that several kinds of energy
        simultaneous over the CHAKRA ELEKTRODE for treatment purposes
        used to become to be able, - that with such disposed electrodes
        of fields - z. B. the pyramid energy over short and far
        distances themselves by subject matters through guided to become
        to be able, 25 - that itself a such use of pyramid energies over
        the CHAKRA ELECTRODE itself particularly to the treatment e.g.
        the subsequent medical indication areas is suitable::
        Degenerative processes, defense-weak, 30 - allergy, asthmatic
        diseases, gland under and hyperactivity, as well as
        Drüsendysfunktionen, blood circulation disturbances,
        inflammations, 35 - diseases of the digesting apparatus, joint
        suffering, tumefaction illnesses, .ierz and cycle suffering,
        Fracture healing, paralyses, scars, nerve diseases, 5 - organ
        illnesses, rheumatoid form circle, pains, Scnwellunxen,
        congestions, 10 - burnings, poisonings and their sequences,
        wound healing… - that also without direct contact energies and
        fields in and/or. on the body of the patient and in and/or. on
        liquids 15 - and cloths brought to become to be able, itself so
        particularly the one for the Vitalisierung of humans and animal
        - e.g. over loaded drinking water, for plant growths - e.g. by
        pouring with water aufgeladeneit - that itself the special
        pyramid energy decrement and guide 20 - among other things with
        the CHAKRA ELECTRODE also for technical ranges such as
        communications technology, warming and propulsion technology… is
        suitable!<br>
        <br>
        The impact of the represented invention becomes in the following
        more near described.<br>
        <br>
        If those is higher the CHAKRA ELECTRODE supplied power density
        at their 25 - input as at their output, then it comes to the
        energy flow toward CHAKRA ELEKTR0DE output. The diverting energy
        becomes by a circling and/or. helical or helical accomplished
        CHAKRA ELECTRODE movement controlled.<br>
        <br>
        Here e.g. becomes. pyramid energy used, then feels 30 - patient
        only cold - or tingling/swarming feeling, which feeling of a
        cold draft of air - also by clothing through - or a warm
        feeling, whereby it always feels the courses of motion, which
        the Behandler with the CHAKRA ELECTRODE accomplishes, on more
        details. Occurrence of warm ones is a character that the
        Behand35 - lung aborted will can. Pulling one or stinging pains
        - also in not direct treated body regions can occur briefly,
        which disappear however in courses of the other treatment. It
        comes during the treatment Head pressure or feeling of
        dizziness, then is this a character for energy-overfill and/or.
        an energy congestion, those by parallel guide of the CHAKRA
        ELECTRODE to the frontal-planar of the human örpers in a
        downward movement of cranial after caudal and 5 - a subsequent
        circular implemented return after cranial with few such courses
        of motion starting from e zones - and/or. balanced will can.<br>
        <br>
        The patient feels with the treatment, with the CHAKRA ELEKTRODE
        anything, then is not present with safety an energy blockade
        with 10 - it, the z.3t'. by toxic loads that; 4eridiane, by
        psychological blockades etc. evoked will can. oh few repeated
        CXAhRA Behandlun EN can in most cases be repaired such
        disturbances.<br>
        <br>
        To observe it is that the patient, which only nothing with the e
        15 - action feels, z. B. the pyramid energy, which becomes
        passed over the CHAKRA ELECTRODE, so long complete with its body
        absorbs, until it feels a cold feeling in the treated zone. Only
        from this an energy withdrawal is to be felt out its bodies rear
        treated zone. This energy out 20 - feels cold steps, so long the
        patient in the treated body region likewise cold felt and feels
        warm, if he feels therein warm ones. With the CHAKRA ELEKTRODE
        accomplished movements can do of the patient over larger
        distances and by subject matters through perceived 25 - become!
        Those the CHAKRA ELECTRODE supplied pyramid energy is to their
        output around so intense, the per large cross-section area of
        the lead from the pyramid is. Blind plug - like it z.E. after
        drawing prevent CHAKRA ELECTRODE sheet - performed are, 30 - the
        drain of the energy on the put in side, so that it can flow off
        only over the CHAKRA ELECTRODE output.<br>
        <br>
        With the use of the pyramid energy it is to be made certain that
        the CHAKRA ELECTRODE the corresponding connection variants after
        Blattl 35 - until 10 made become, since otherwise effect losses
        show up, itself the z0B. by Kinesiologietestungen at the humans
        to prove leave.<br>
        <br>
        Becomes for the receptacle of the pyramid energy one for this in
        Claim listed electrode variants used, then is to be considered
        before everything for medical purposes the certain connection
        way after flat 1 to 10.<br>
        <br>
        The pyramid delivers schiedliche energy qualities over its
        surfaces, edges and tip unter5 -, which is connected with its
        alignment of a basic edge in north south direction and which by
        sensitive humans perceived to become to be able. If actual this
        places altogether 18 energy-effect-planar - in each case 9
        planes after aufen and inward - when light sources with
        unterschied10 - colors lichen forwards, then light shows itself
        that itself e.g. in the pyramid cup electrode a light mixture
        results in, however over the respective Lichtuellen plane - the
