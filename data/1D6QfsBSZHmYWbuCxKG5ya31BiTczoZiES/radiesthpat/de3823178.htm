        style="float: right;" class="btnY"></span> The invention relates
      to a device for collecting and selectively transmitting programmed
      radiesthetically measurable radiation, in particular, to the human
      body. The device comprises three or four functional elements which
      are connected to one another, namely a pyramid-shaped body as a
      radiation collector, a vessel serving as radiation transmitter and
      a tubular radiation injector and, if appropriate, a radiation
      adapter.<br>

      <p>Subject matter of the invention is an apparatus for collecting
        and targeted transmitted one of particularly programmed
        radiästhetisch measurable radiations on the human body and
        consists of three and/or. four connected with one another
        functional elements, i.e. <br>
        <br>
        a) for a RADIATION COLLECTING TANK (1), i.e. a known pyramidal
        body actual for it, either on the base surface stands (to the
        decrease of pluspoliger radiation) (Fig. 1+2) or with the help
        of a frame (11) with the tip disposed is downward in Fig. 3+4
        (to the decrease of minuspoliger radiation), in each case a
        collector (2), disposed in the pyramid, which to a sleeve (3)
        leads, and <br>
      </p>
      <p> b) a RADIATION TRANSMITTER (5), an upward open or openable
        vessel from non magnetic, “neutral” material, in substances and
        or magnets inserted or white or colored light irradiated to
        become i.e. to be able and over a releasable or fixed wire
        connection (4) with the radiation collecting tank (1) in Fig.
        1+3 connected is, and over a wire connection (4), either
        releasable or fixed, with the radiation injector (6) connected
        is more other and <br>
      </p>
      <p> c) a RADIATION INJECTOR (6), that of a single closed plastic
        tube with central radiation part (7), running out stored
        therein, to the open end in tips, consists and over a wire
        connection (4) with the radiation transmitter (5) in Fig. 1+3
        connected is, and if necessary <br>
      </p>
      <p> d) a RADIATION ADAPTER (9), from a radiation part running out
        in tips, which over a releasable or fixed wire connection (4)
        with the radiation collecting tank (1) in Fig. 2+4 connected is,
        embedded into an upward open housing exists and underneath the
        radiation transmitter (5) the disposed is. <br>
      </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>By putting the radiation transmitter (5 on) in Fig. 2+4 on the
        radiation adapter (9) in Fig. 2+4 the respective radiation (plus
        or minus) is flowed through direct by the container soil into
        the radiation transmitter (5) initiated and its volume. </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The entire device according to invention consists of three
        and/or. four functional elements, which stand in a narrow
        technical-functional context; it is in Fig. 1-4 shown. The
        single functional elements are in Fig. 5-8 shown. Fig. 5 the
        radiation collecting tank (1) on the base standing places
        and/or. with the tip downward disposed pyramid. Fig. 6 shows the
        radiation transmitter (5), into which substances inserted is
        flowed through to become to be able and its volume by the
        radiation. Fig. 8 is the representation of the radiation
        injector (6), introduced with which the particularly programmed
        radiation becomes targeted on the human body directed and into
        the human body. Fig. 7 shows the radiation adapter (9), becomes
        already possible by whose use a rapid exchange from radiation
        transmitters occupied with particular programmes. </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>With that to using pyramidal bodies it according to invention
        acts prefered around a pyramid with square base surface, in
        particular after the proportions of the Cheopspyramide.
        Favorable dimensions for the pyramid are: Basis-prolonged 15
        cms, height of 10 cms, pedestal 2 cm, which can also be void.
        The pyramid mass 1-4 multiplied could become with the factor.
        The transmitter container, into which the medicaments, arbitrary
        substances, magnets or other additions know set or white or
        colored light in-irradiated who, can arbitrary formed be. A
        box-like form becomes prefered. The vessel should open
        convenient upward or be open above. As materials conventional
        materials come, like z. B. Metals, glass etc. in considerations.
      </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The radiation injector (6) should be as handy as possible. The
        radiation part (7) can be a pointedly running out metal bar or
        wire. The radiation part (7) can consist also of wire or glass
        fiber braids, which can be also to several bundled. The space
        between radiation injector and radiation part can be filled in
        usual way with plastic. In this case the open end of the
        radiation injector is to be ground. The radiation part should
        have 4) direct Kon DP N=4 clock&lt; with&gt; the wire connection
        (. In addition, slight wire interruptions become antenna-like
        bridged by the radiation. Glass fiber cable or wire braids also
        bundled is more usable, because splitting up of the radiation
        field is so particularly favourable to “wire end”. </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The functional elements, i.e. the pyramidal bodies and the
        transmitter container, can be from each other movable or in
        composite a disposed. The Strahungsinjektor must be to the
        handling free movable. The wire connection, which can consist
        also of a movable glass fiber wire, between radiation
        transmitter container and radiation injector, is if necessary
        releasable disposed. The size of the radiation transmitter
        container is to be adapted to the space requirement for the
        additions respective and be arranged more replaceable therefore
        by varying sizes. The advantage is to be given to a sleeve,
        which is in the upper portion of the transmitter container
        mounted. Exactly the same can be proceeded with the wire
        connection between the pyramidal body and the radiation
        transmitter container. The transition from the radiation
        collecting tank to the radiation transmitter can be different,
        fixed installed, free inserted or the bottom vessel as radiation
        adapter the tips mounted be upward running out. Prefered one
        becomes the solution of a free irradiation from above with a
        glass fiber bundle. The solution - also in a radiation adapter
        running out wire end from the radiation collecting tank - is
        possible. </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>To the nature of the pyramid radiation to the pertinent
        literature it is referred from which known is that the microwave
        range for such appearances is to be made liable. </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>To the instant invention at the next coming state of the art to
        the Patent Laid open DE 33 20 518 one refers, which has an
        apparatus for changing from radiästhetischen fields to the
        subject matter. This object becomes using a pyramidal body that
        within this body or several elements, dissolved by the fact, z.
        B. an other pyramidal body or an element resonancable within the
        microwave range, like z. B. a spiral or a homöopathisches
        preparation angeordn is. </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> From the subject matter of the DE 33 20 518 the instant
        invention differs both in the object and in the found machine
        solution. While the apparatus of the DE 33 20 518 the purpose
        tracked is appropriate to change radiästhetisch measurable
        fields with the object to switch negative effects off for the
        instant invention the object to reasons to create an apparatus
        which collecting and the targeted transmission make possible
        particularly programmed radiästhetisch measurable radiations on
        the human Körp. </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>In the present context is still the book publication of
        Dr.Franz Morell “MORA therapy” (1987, K.F. Haug publishing
        house, Heidelberg) cited become. In it an apparatus and a
        therapy procedure are described, which on electromagnetic
        oscillations as effective principle are based. The MORA
        apparatus works after the transmitter/receiver principle and
        aims at it off to take up the electromagnetic oscillations
        (informations), derived of the patient in the apparatus by an
        inverse circuit 180 degree and return in such a way as
        oscillation at the patients. </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The pathological oscillation and those of the MORA apparatus
        generated Gegenschwingung, derived of the patient, waive
        themselves mutual. With the fact effected becomes that the
        pathological body oscillation cleared will and an improvement of
        the condition of the patient becomes effected. </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Even if this known apparatus and procedure of Morell are based
        on the one hand and the according to invention on the other hand
        on a same effective radiation principle, then nevertheless the
        respective objects and approaches whole obvious in such a manner
        from each other remote that of Morell the described apparatus
        and procedure is in no manner appropriate, lie to the apparatus
        according to invention, which is simpler also substantial as the
        Mora apparatus, to refer. </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Collecting and consolidating the radiation in accordance with
        the present invention made in the pyramidal body with the
        collector (2), whereby the pyramid in north south direction or
        reverse - to set up is. With incorporated magnets with small
        magnetic field the location is independent of the North-South
        axis. The pyramid radiation is then passed on over a wire
        connection into the radiation transmitter container. LN the
        radiation transmitter container, which is flowed through by the
        pyramid radiation, become medicaments set. With the fact
        believed becomes that informations are carried forward over the
        substance and the effect of the medicine, i.e. that the
        radiation particularly programmed becomes. </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The particularly programmed radiation is passed on over a wire
        connection to the radiation injector and transferred with its
        assistance targeted into the human body (in particular the ear
        canal or belly navel). Furthermore deficits can be repaired by
        radiations in the body thereby as the radiations targeted are
        transferred into the body. </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>It becomes believed that the informations arrive at the
        respective organs and at the brain and become there remaining
        stored. It becomes other believed that the corresponding Chinese
        teaching of “YIN and the YANG energy” the flux of this energy in
        certain trajectories runs. For this Claus's becomes C on the
        text book of the Chinese medicine for western physicians of.

      <p> </p>
      <p>One divides the human body into four Quadrante, whereby the
        Zwerchfell is the horizontal boundary. The two lower quadrants
        (abdomen, legs and links head half) become by the radiation of
        the pyramid covered, those upward the base aligned have in Fig.
        3+4. The two upper quadrants (upper bodies, arms and the right
        body half) become by the radiation of the pyramid covered, those
        downward the base aligned have in Fig. 1+2. The experience shows
        up in the Chinese teaching confirmed that also in YIN YANG
        and/or. in YANG YIN is. </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The surprising efficacy of the procedure with the apparatus
        according to invention can become in the radiation picture of
        the Kirlian photograph detected. The particular advantage
        according to invention of the method feasible with the apparatus
        lies in the fact that the medicaments are not substantial into
        the body introduced to become to have and nevertheless full
        effective. </p>
      <p> </p>

        inserted to become to be able, the medicaments conventional in
        the treatment of the welfare practical man into considerations,
