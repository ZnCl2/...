            <span style="font-weight: bold;">Method for influencing the
              degree of order of an inorganic or organic system by using
              the change, occurring in the area of action of a hollow
              pyramid</span></big><br>

        </span>The invention an included method to the interference of
        the order measure of an inorganic or organic system by
        utilization itself of the change of the there otherwise dominant
        earth's magnetic field portion adjusting in the effective range
        of an hollow pyramid.<br>
        <br>
        The word “system” referred in this context each form of
        inorganic or organic structures, begun with simple molecules up
        to organisms of all type. The bottom term “order measure” is to
        be understood the respective energy content of such a system.<br>
        <br>
        Methods of the mentioned type are for example in the CS-PS
        91,304, the EP-A 84,108 449,4, in the DE-GbmS 84 60 071,3 and in
        an article of Karel Drbal “the fight and the pyramid patent” in
        a book “Pyramid power” from max of Toth, Freiburg 1977,
        described and will among other things used to affect on organic
        or inorganic substances, in addition, small organisms in order
        to affect their properties in certain sense.<br>
        <br>
        With most described methods so called “Cheopspyramiden” becomes
        used, i.e. Pyramids with an inclination angle of 51 DEG 51 min
        51 min min. They consist either of iron sheet metal, copper
        sheet, aluminium sheet, wood, plastic, cardboard or other
        materials, whereby both ferromagnetic, and paramagnetic or
        dia.-magnetic materials come to the application, whose volume
        susceptibility is appropriate etw for range of -10, i.e.
        throughout above a value is settled of -15.<br>
        <br>
        In the technology one understands bottom magnetic susceptibility
        (measure of the magnetizability of a cloth) the difference mu g
        1, where again the mass susceptibility<br>
        <br>
        EMI7.1<br>
        <br>
        the magnetic permeability of a cloth related to the permeability
        of the empty space is. The value mu represents the absolute
        permeability of a cloth and is derived from the ratio of the
        magnetic induction to the magnetic field strength, so that thus<br>
        <br>
        EMI7.2<br>
        <br>
        is.<br>
        <br>
        For the evaluation of pyramid materials the term of the volume
        susceptibility is more meaningful, which becomes general used in
        the Magnetochemie. Afterwards the susceptibility is on the space
        measure of 1 cm&lt; 3&gt; based (volume susceptibility chi v),
        while in each case the susceptibility based on 1 g of the
        respective cloth is chi g (= mu r) again the mass
        susceptibility. Thus the designation results<br>
        <br>
        EMI8.1<br>
        <br>
        where D (= alpha) is the density of the respective cloth.<br>
        <br>
        So for example copper has a density of 8,9, a mass
        susceptibility of -1,08 and a volume susceptibility of -9,6,
        urea a density of 1,3, a mass susceptibility of -7,0 and a
        volume susceptibility of -9,1, bismuth a density of 9,7, a mass
        susceptibility of -16 and a volume susceptibility of -155,2 etc.<br>
        <br>
        The dimensions of the known pyramids with mostly square base
        surface are appropriate for generally high-moderate between
        approximately 20 cms and 30 cms, while the soil edge measure
        lies for instance between 20 cms and 50 cms. Therefore the
        pyramids are down open and have the form of an hat, which can be
        inverted to light substrate which can be affected over that.<br>
        <br>
        With the prior art processes will among other things desired,
        the growth of small organisms, as for example worms or plant
        cultures to promote and/or. to reach with these a larger
        resistance against health influences. Furthermore attempted one
        to improve and prevent with organic or inorganic cloths old
        features the topping-up of foods by pyramid influence.<br>
        <br>
        It has itself shown that become achieved with the prior art
        processes only very uncertain results. Thus it turned out that
        for example whole snail clutches of eggs or plant cultures died,
        instead of developing. Similar experiences became also made with
        embryos of other type. Whole general did not occur the desired
        success and frequent became the opposite of that achieved, which
        intended was.<br>
        <br>
        By the invention the solve the problem are to become to avoid
        those with that so far prior art processes of occurred misses
        and a larger reliability with the achievement of the desired in
        each case technical effect obtained.<br>
        <br>
        This object becomes, on the basis of a method the interference
        of the order measure of an inorganic or organic system by
        utilization of the change of the there otherwise dominant
        earth's magnetic field portion of the initially mentioned type,
        according to the invention adjusting in the effective range of
        an hollow pyramid that the earth magnet partial field by at
        least one, dissolved by the fact, essentially in the local
        inclination angle inclined hollow pyramid side on preferably on
        the inside, bottom or in next vicinity of the pyramid, formed
        aligned with the inclination-planar to the magnetic north south
        direction, from dia.-magnetic material, system brought directed
        will and the system becomes its natural development time of the
        pyramid influence exposed essentially in the long run.<br>
        <br>
        The inclination angle amounts to for example in hammer-fixed 77
        DEG, in Munich 67 DEG, in Rome 55 DEG, in Calcutta 30 DEG in
        Ceylon 0 DEG. In each case the geographical areas located
        between them the inclination angle has corresponding
        intermediate values, but has itself shown the fact that the
        technical success desired with the invention process occurs also
        if plus or minus up to 7 DEG from in each case at the procedure
        place valid inclination angle is deviated.<br>
        <br>
        The invention included in addition an hollow pyramid to the
        embodiment of the invention process, which by the fact
        characterized is that at least one pyramid side is bottom
        inclination angle inclined relevant for the application place
        and that zumindestens this pyramid side consists of
        dia.-magnetic material with a volume susceptibility below -15.
        As material for this pyramid side and/or. for the embodiment of
        the whole pyramid are suitable brass, zinc, silver, bismuth,
        graphite or ytterbium with in each case a volume susceptibility
        of below -15. In modification its knows the respective pyramid
        side or also the whole hollow pyramid from an alloy or
        composition of coppers with brass, zinc, silver, bismuth,
        graphite or ytterbium and/or. of copper sheet with an oxide
        layer consists, whereby the volume susceptibility of these
        alloys and/or. Is appropriate for compositions below -15 in each
        case.<br>
        <br>
        In modification its can consist the hollow pyramid according to
        invention of a composition of plastic, preferably epoxy resin,
        with copper, copper sheet with oxide layer, brass, zinc, silver,
        bismuth, graphite or ytterbium, whereby again the volume
        susceptibility of this composition lies below -15.<br>
        <br>
        The term “composition” covers copper sheet in this context for
        example with bonded, galvanic applied, evaporated, up-sintered,
        sprayed, applied or on other manner applied coats or several
        that in each case different components.<br>
        <br>
        The hollow pyramid according to invention is favourable as
        straight pyramid with regular polygonal base surface formed.
        Preferably the base surface of the hollow pyramid has the form
        of an equilateral triangle or a square, whereby a pyramid side
        exists made of graphite, bismuth or brass and the remaining
        pyramid sides from preferably transparent plastic formed are.<br>
        <br>
        After a modified embodiment of the hollow pyramid according to
        invention a pyramid wall flat-moderate can out-seize over de
        Pyramidenumriss and preferably have rectangular shape. This
        applies in particular if this pyramid wall opposite the other
        pyramid walls from another material formed is.<br>
        <br>
        After an other embodiment of the hollow pyramid according to
        invention to each other parallel intermediate walls are disposed
        in the pyramid-inner, which are the bottom inclination angle
        inclined. These intermediate walls can fill out either the
        interior hollow pyramid whole or but have with their bottom
        edges a certain distance of the pyramid lower surface, in order
        to offer space for a substrate which can be brought in.<br>
        <br>
        In the extreme case the pyramid base surface can as regular
        infinite polygon, i.e. present themselves as circle the formed
        its and thus pyramid as straight circle cones.<br>
        <br>
        In development of the invention an hollow pyramid according to
        invention with or several similarly shaped pyramids to a pyramid
        battery a summarized can be.<br>
        <br>
        This can take place according to the invention either by means
        of the fact that the same at one and/or. several their basis
        edges with a basis edge of one and/or. several adjacent (n)
        pyramid (n) fixed or releasable connected for its part if
        necessary in each case is, those in same way with one and/or.
        several neighbour pyramid (n) connected is and/or. are. An
        against-intimate half edge seamed joint can serve or but the
        hollow pyramid is with that or the neighbour pyramids side face
        against side face together resting fixed or releasable
        connected, those for its part if necessary in each case in same
        way with one and/or as releasable connection between the hollow
        pyramids either. several neighbour pyramid (n) connected is
        and/or. are. If a fixed connection exists between the neighbour
        pyramids, then the same can at that and/or. the bordering side
        (n) in each case a common wall with the neighbour pyramid have.<br>
        <br>
        If a releasable connection is provided in the contrast for this
        between the adjacent hollow pyramids, then these as multipoint
        push button connection formed can be.<br>
        <br>
        The hollow pyramid according to invention is at least 1 cm high
        and can a maximum height of approximately 30 m have.<br>
        <br>
        The wall thickness of the hollow pyramid according to invention
        amounts to at the most 25% and at least 0.01% of the surface
        area diagonal measure and/or. the cone base circle diameter. The
        base surface of the hollow pyramid according to invention is
        preferably open.<br>
        <br>
        The finally included invention an application of the invention
        process and/or. the hollow pyramid according to invention on the
        development improvement the subsequent inorganic organic
        systems:<br>
        <br>
        a) Formation of crystals in solutions, for example copper
        sulfate or Kaliumchromat;<br>
        <br>
        b) Breeding of Kleinstlebewesen such as bacteria or funguses,
        for example Proteus mirabilis or yeast, outside of or within
        nutrient solutions;<br>
        <br>
        c) Improvement of the development of seed, for example bean,
        flax or poppy seed, seed grain;<br>
        <br>
        d) Improvement of the development of embryos like e.g.
        Froschlaich, Forellen or Hechteier;<br>
        <br>
        e) Taste improvement of life or luxuries;<br>
        <br>
        f) Durability improvement of life or luxuries.<br>
        <br>
        Experiments of the inventor with the invention process have
        shown that contrary to the prior art processes with the
        invention process the desired in each case effect with large
        safety occurs and misses practical did not arise at all. These
        experiments shown in addition that the application of the
        invention process is larger substantial, than one had suspected
        in connection with prior art processes.<br>
        <br>
        In a brochure “Pyron force from the cosmos”, published in Pisa,
        describes professor Erich Mueller, Castelnuovo, Versuche, whom
        it has with known pyramids on in aquariums living person,
        particularly joyful, flat-shelled worms of the genus
        Isognostaoma performed, at whose Laich the development
        particularly good to be observed is. The clutch of eggs of such
        worms usually covers between eight and twelve eggs.<br>
        <br>
        With simultaneous control snails of this species examined
        without pyramid effect the development normal ran, i.e. all eggs
        grew up up to hatching coordinated to each other. In the same
        clutch of eggs the same development step resulted in each case
        in the case of all eggs.<br>
        <br>
        With the worms, which had been already spent before the
        Laichablage a bottom known Cheopspyramide, shown itself that the
        eggs, although they were all of the same age exhibited in each
        case various development steps. So eggs could be found after
        approximately three to four weeks after Laichablage in in and to
        the same Laichpaket, which were still in one much early stage,
        while other eggs had already its Schneckenhaus formed and almost
        slip-mature were. After approximately the same time however the
        entire clutch of eggs died and it came never more to leaving the
        Eihäute as well as the Gallerthülle. Initial one was to be
        observed also with these worms a significant acceleration of
        their embryonic development opposite the control snails. The
        inventor of the invention process has these experiments likewise
        with Cheopspyramiden repeated and the same negative result
        achieved.<br>
        <br>
        It was from the beginning the conviction of the inventor of the
        invention process that would have to succeed with this to obtain
        and make this in any form uniform and reliable results of the
        pyramid effect more measurable.<br>
        <br>
        The inventor repeated Mueller min snail attempts with the
        invention process schen. The result was surprising: It shown
        itself that the examined eggs were almost without exception
        slip-mature after approximately three weeks and that also in the
        future essentially the whole clutch of eggs viable remained.<br>
        <br>
        Encouraged by this favorable experimental result the inventor
        expanded its experiments since Froschlaich, Fischlaich and yeast
        cultures (Bierhefe and red increasing yeast). Also here shown
        itself that with application of prior art processes, which
        became performed by means of Cheopspyramiden in particular
        primarily with Froschlaich a very high number of deaths ratio
        occurred, while observed with application of the invention
        process almost no negative effects could become on the examined
        cultures. With experiments with algae in the water and with
        moistened Kressensamen again the observation became confirmed
        that the prior art processes affect themselves whole general
        growth-retarding, while with application of the invention
        process prospering the organisms substantial runs more
        favorable.<br>
        <br>
        With the treatment of inorganic substrates the shown invention
        process opposite the prior art processes of substantial more
        favorable results. While for example became achieved with
        application of prior art processes on the crystallization of
        copper sulfate or Kaliumdichromat essentially only normal
        crystals, the crystallization of copper sulfate resulted in
        partly even only anomalous stunted crystals in the case of
        application of the invention process beautiful, deep-blue,
        parallelogram-like crystals up to 5 cms edge length. In the case
        of the formation of Kaliumdichromatkristallen arose rectangular
        to square, orange boards from 1 cm to 2 cms edge length.<br>
        <br>
        With the fact is detected that become promoted by application of
        the invention process both organic and inorganic life
        procedures. This finding might open a very substantial technical
        importance for the invention.<br>
        <br>
        The invention process and some embodiments of the hollow pyramid
        according to invention become now for example in detail

        The dimensions, yardsticks and in particular wall thicknesses of
        the various represented hollow pyramids indicated in the designs
        are not for the practical embodiment the same by any means
        binding. Considerably for this rather the material, is
        manufactured made of which the respective hollow pyramid, is
        naturally also their respective kind of manufacture. Same
        numerals designate same in each case or equivalent acting parts
        and are if necessary provided with subscripts.<br>
        <br>
        With in Fig. 1 represented scheme of an embodiment of a method
        to the interference of substrates the referred reference letter
        A an oblique hollow pyramid with oblique-winkelig--triangular
        plan view, whose is a pyramid wall Aa a bottom angle beta
        against the horizontal inclined, which inclination angle
        relevant for the application place corresponds. The
        inclination-planar is by the dash-dotted registered trace lines
        off and AC indicated. Like apparent, the pyramid A with their
        inclination-planar is accurate aligned on the magnetic north
        south direction.<br>
        <br>
        The down open pyramid A is inverted over a substrate B, which in
        a receptacle C is. If it concerns with the substrate for example
        seed, then the same remains to its natural Keimzeit the bottom
        pyramid at least in the long run, so that at the execution place
        of the method and by their pyramid side Aa can affect dominant,
        by the pyramid A at least in particular on the substrate B
        concentrated earth magnet partial field on the period of the
        natural germination the seed. As result it shows up that the
        percentage of begun to germinate seed amounted to with
        application of the just described method about 70% of the
        treated good one, while the same constituted 42% during
        non-application of the method only.<br>
        <br>
        Fig. 2,a procedure arrangement shows 2, with which a straight
        pyramid A min square in the plan view, whose is all four pyramid
        sides against the horizontal in the angle beta inclined, is
        inverted over an aquarium D likewise square in the plan view, in
        which Hechteier E are. It became the time measured, until all
        young fish had slipped. The experiment became then shown with a
        Cheopspyramide repeated and it that during the same time
        interval still none of the young fish had slipped.<br>
        <br>
        The Fig. 3 to 6 represents an hollow pyramid with square base
        and an inclination angle beta 1 of 67 DEG, how it corresponds to
        Munich in for instance the earthmagnetic inclination angle for
        the space. The wall thickness D of the hollow pyramid is
        exaggerated strong shown and might with an height dimension of
        the pyramid between approximately 15 cms and 30 cms with
        fabrication of the hollow pyramid from copper sheet
        approximately between 0.5 mm and 1.5 mm amount to. If such a
        pyramid becomes from other material manufactured, then or must
        its wall thickness can become naturally also corresponding large
        selected.<br>
        <br>
        The height dimension between 15 cms and 30 cms is in particular
        appropriate for lab uses of the hollow pyramid. For industrial
        applications substantial larger dimensions are more conceivable
        and therefore naturally also larger wall thicknesses.<br>
        <br>
        Such a hollow pyramid of larger dimension is for example in Fig.
        7 in the diagram shown. The pyramid basis is again square. The
        pyramid-high can amount to in this case up to 30 m, the wall
        thickness of the pyramid calculated itself from used in each
        case the material for their fabrication after static aspects.
        The pyramid inclination angle beta 2 amounts to in this cases 77
        DEG, which equals an use of the pyramid in the space
        hammer-fixed, where the inclination angle of the earth's
        magnetic field in approximately this amount corresponds.<br>
        <br>
        In Fig. 8 is an hollow pyramid again with square pyramid basis
        in the diagram shown, whose pyramid inclination angle beta 3
        corresponds to a value of 55 DEG, which equals again the
        inclination angle of the earth's magnetic field for the space
        Rome. The height dimension of this pyramid can amount to for
        example 7.5 m. The pyramid wall thickness depends also here
        again on the used building material.<br>
        <br>
        Fig. an hollow pyramid shows 9 in plan view, whose pyramid basis
        is an equilateral triangle. Such a hollow pyramid could be for
        example again from copper sheet manufactured and have depending
        upon its geographical use area and the pyramid inclination angle
        conditional thereby an height of v about 80 cms until 1.50 m.<br>
        <br>
        In Fig. a regular five-angular pyramid basis has 10 hollow
        pyramid shown. Their dimensions depend again on its use, its
        place of use and the material, from which them are to be
        manufactured.<br>
        <br>
        The base in the Fig. the form of a regular Achtecks has 11 and
        12 represented hollow pyramid. Its inclination angle beta 4
        amounts to, if it is to find in the space Munich use, again
        about 67 DEG.<br>
        <br>
        The Fig. 13 and 14 shows an hollow pyramid, whose base
        infinite-hit a corner, i.e. a circle is and their form
        consequently that of a cone assumes. The cone angle b 5 amounts
        to, if this Sonderbauart of an hollow pyramid is to the use in
        the space Munich certain, again 67 DEG.<br>
        <br>
        The Fig. 15 to 17 shows a combination of three hollow pyramids
        1, 2 and 3 in each case a type in accordance with the Fig. 3 to
        6 to a multiple pyramid, whereby the adjacent pyramid walls 1a
        and 2a and/or. 2b and 3a depending upon the material, made from
        which the pyramids are 1, 2 and 3, with one another soldered,
        bonded or welded to be can. A sectional view of such an hollow
        pyramid arrangement is from Fig. 17 apparent.<br>
        <br>
        Fig. a modified spatial form of such an hollow pyramid
        arrangement shows 18, with which the adjacent walls of the
        affecting pyramids 1, 2 and 3 in each case to a common wall 2C
        and/or. 2d summarized are. The hollow pyramid arrangement in
        accordance with Fig. 18 represents thus an integral body,
        depending upon the material used to his fabrication either by
        soldering together or welding together and/or. Stick single
        triangular tiles or in addition, by pouring, syringes or presses
        from a piece manufactured to be can.<br>
        <br>
        One wants an hollow pyramid arrangement in accordance with the
        Fig. 15 to 17 makes auseinandernehmbar, then the adjacent
        pyramid walls 1a and 2a can and/or. 2b and 3a in in Fig. 19
        manner shown by pushbutton connections releasable connected with
        one another its, those, as in Fig. 19 shown, in simple manner by
        pins with ball head formed to be can, which are put to pyramid
        wall an attached and through a bore of the other pyramid wall in
        each case.<br>
        <br>
        The Fig. 20 and 21 shows an hollow pyramid battery, which is
        formed from 64 single pyramids with square in each case base.
        The pyramids can be depending upon used material their
        together-pushing basis edges soldered with one another, welded
        or bonded in each case and are for better stability convenient
        on a corresponding square lattice framework fitted. In Fig. 20
        is with 4 in chain lines an placed underneath trough indicated,
        in which the substrate which can be affected with the pyramid
        battery is.<br>
        <br>
        One wants that the single hollow pyramids in the Fig. 20 and 21
        hollow pyramid battery shown single from each other more
        separable is, then the basis edges of these single pyramids with
        an against-intimate half edge seamed joint equipped can be, like
        them Fig. 22 shows. The half edge seamed joint exists in each
        case at each edge of over the half edge length an extending,
        downward open rebate ä and itself over the remainder of the edge
        extending, upward open rebate 5b. The rebates are so in each
        case against-intimate mounted at the pyramid base edges that
        they complement each other with Aneinanderstossen of two pyramid
        edges mutual and so a releasable clutch zwische form for the
        adjacent pyramid base edges.<br>
        <br>
        In Fig. 23 represented skew hollow pyramid 6 exhibits a plan
        view in form of a skew triangle. One of the pyramid walls 6a,
        6b, 6c, i.e. the pyramid wall 6a, is opposite that horizontal
        around the local inclination angle beta inclined. The trace of
        the inclination-planar is in the drawing 2 indicated by the
        chain lines s 1 and s. The pyramid wall 6a seizes in addition,
        as from the drawing apparent, over pyramid-outlined outside and
        has with the illustrated embodiment the form of a rectangle.
        Preferably the pyramid wall 6a consists of graphite, while the
        two other pyramid walls 6b and 6c can consist in each case of
        preferably transparent plastic. In the use the pyramid becomes 6
        again so established that the inclination-planar s 1, s 2 cuts
        the pyramid wall 6a vertical, which in the drawing by the right
        angle gamma indicated is. The pyramid wall 6a and/or. the
        pyramid walls 6b and 6c can be naturally also from other
        materials made. The limitation did not pyramid-outline spreading
        part of the pyramid wall 6a needs rectangular to be, but can
        also different form have, for example thus triangular or
        parabolic and/or. semicircular its.<br>
        <br>
        In Fig. 24 is an other embodiment of an hollow pyramid to the
        embodiment of the conscious method shown. This hollow pyramid 7
        is preferably a straight pyramid with square or
        equilateral-triangular plan view. The pyramid sides 7a are the
        preferably bottom local inclination angle against the horizontal
        inclined. With this embodiment of the pyramid represented in the
        vertical agent profile to each other paralle intermediate walls
        are 7b disposed in the pyramid-inner, which for its part again
        to one that the bottom inclination angle beta inclined pyramid
        outer walls 7a parallel runs. These parallel intermediate walls
        7b can fill out the pyramid up to the base, leave however, as
        preferably in the drawing shown, above the pyramid basis a
        clearance open, in which a that can become substrate contained
        vessel 8 housed which can be treated.<br>
        <br>
        Like already multiple mentioned, the mode of production of the
        single hollow pyramid arranges itself and/or. the described
        multiple pyramids or hollow pyramid batteries in each case after
        the dimensions the same, the used material and the place of use
        and/or. - purpose of the respective arrangement. Case of sheets
        or plastic boards used will, can the single boards through in
        each case solders, welding or sticking connected with one
        another be and/or. with large sizes naturally also different
        connecting kinds can find such as rivets or mutual bolting
        application. Substantial one for the function of the respective
        hollow pyramid and/or. Hollow pyramid arrangement in the sense
        of the feedthrough of the described method is the adherence to
        the material regulation and the adherence to the inclination
        angle relevant for the respective place of work as inclination
        angle for the respective pyramid wall (EN) as well as the
        alignment of the pyramid on the earthmagnetic north south
        direction. <br>
