      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract</span> -- Antennas - bar
      antennas, V-shaped multiple-bar antennas, spirals, in connection
      with tubular sleeves which serve as wave guides and are or may be
      equipped with a ground reflector to increase their effect, emit
      all around a deflecting radiation or an interference radiation in
      the upright position in conjunction with a directional reflector
      mounted at the top, charged by a geopathic wave field. This
      radiation is capable in its effective range of drifting or
      neutralising other interfering stimuli/radiation caused by further
      interference zones (water veins, etc.). In the case of
      interference radiation/deflection radiation directed downwards due
      to a corresponding reflector shape there is no rod deflection
      above the erection site. In the case of interference
      radiation/deflection radiation directed upwards due to a
      corresponding reflector shape there is no rod deflection below the
      erection site. The effective range is influenced by the size of
      the antenna, the charge thereof (interference zone crossing) and
      by the shape of the reflector screen.<br>
      <br>
      Description title: Apparatus to the directed deflection and/or
      Shield of so-called Earth radiation geopathogenic zone and
      different disturbances like antennas and power tension masts and
      similar radiators.<br>
      <br>
      Genus of the subject-matter of the application: The invention
      relates to an apparatus to Deflection and/o. Shield of so-called
      FRG jets - geopathogenic zones and other interference sources
      after the waiter understood the claim 1.<br>
      <br>
      Indications to the genus: Geopathogenic zones often disturb the
      whole living sleep and work range.<br>
      <br>
      Therefore it is most favorable for effective sleep a place
      screening, these by an entire screening of the living to reach
      range, over in particular disturbing radiations of water veins,
      electrical connections, iron construction constructions among
      other things from the beginning to elemination.<br>
      <br>
      State of the art: To screening so-called. geopathogenic zones
      become and. A. used:<br>
      Magnets e.g. (German patent specification 905298)<br>
      Resonant circuits e.g. (German Ge custom sample, Rollennr.
      68533190.5)<br>
      Radiation protection covers e.g. (German Utility Model, Rollennr.
      6833195.6)<br>
      Criticism of the state of the art: Frequent offered “screening
      devices” pull themselves only on the sleep range (German patent
      specification 68333195,6).<br>
      <br>
      Other apparatuses require one strah lungsfreien location and are
      to an accurate Word south alignment bound (German patent
      specification 3210737 aluminium, and associated manual).<br>
      <br>
      Other apparatuses, the exclusive also Spiral forms work, radiate
      all laterally, which is felt occasional as unan genehm. (Lit.
      Hartmann, Disease as location problem, 4. Aufl., Haug publishing
      house. S. 182)<br>
      Object: The invention is the basis the object;<br>
      <br>
      1. a central shield of the space which can be screened and/or. To
      reach home on the part of screening equipment, without undesirable
      Abstrah lungs into the “screening” around giving.<br>
      <br>
      2. Regarding the Aufatellungworted independent of a
      attraction-free To be location.<br>
      <br>
      3. Ilinsichtlich of the list unab hängig of an exact north south

      Description of several embodiments: a) The 1. Drawing does not
      show a V-shaped disposed multi-blade antenna (1) out leads fÜhigem
      material, insulated or insulated, in upright position, off nung
      above, with a reflector screen (2) provided, whose radiation is
      directed downward. (5)<br>
      The arrangement is with one zvlindri do not schen conductive or
      conductive Sleeve (3) enclosed, as Auf9tel lungsstÜtze, as well as
      to the receptacle that Filler materials (cement, sand, art
      material mass, wax among other things - see upper SN Aspruch,
      characterizing part) serves, whereby the bottom of the sleeve can
      become effect the reinforcement formed as reflector.<br>
      <br>
      These V-shaped disposed blade antenna, which becomes established
      within a spike, it? eugt a radiation, which way suitable by the
      screen/reflector becomes in all around reflected. This Abstrah
      lung an effected screening by field change. Other spikes located
      in the effective range lose by these Radiation their keizwirkung.
      are rods excursion can there nachge no longer pointed to become.
      (Lit. Gustav baron of<br>
      Pohl, “earth jets as disease and Cancer exciter ", 1978, S.161) b)
      the 2. Drawing shows a V-shaped disposed multi-blade antenna (1)
      out leads capable material, insulated or not ISO liert, in upright
      position, opening above, with a reflector screen (2) provided,
      whose radiation is directed upward.<br>
      <br>
      In this reflector position that serves To system for screening
      from above to the breakdown attractions, how they nen from
      Fernsehanten, Hochspannungsmasten and similar high-altitude
      radiators occur go out.<br>
      <br>
      In the effect periphery of this screening above incoming Dtörreize
      with the rod cannot become any longer detected from.<br>
      <br>
      o) 3. Drawing shows the V-shaped disposed multi-blade antenna (1),
      in bedded in a metallic zylindri schen sleeve (3 '). The sleeve is
      open above, your bottom consists of metal the lenen reflector
      screen (2 '). the system sleeve (3 '), antenna (1),
      Reilektorschirm (2) is for his part bedded into the non conductive
      zylin drische plastic tube (3). As a bed-measured the before
      beschrie benen comes into considerations (see 1. Execution
      example).<br>
      <br>
      The bottom end of the plastic tube (3) is sealed and formed as
      reflector (4). Comes as reflector Mterial from smooth and/or spie
      gel that surface to the application.<br>
      <br>
      The radial radiation to the “Entstö rung " plastic pipe (3)
      becomes put on reflector screen (2) directed by on. This radiation
      direction serves for ntstörung from geopathischen soil
      attractions.<br>
      <br>
      With reverse heflektorstellung (2) radiation after oblique upward
      - a shield of breakdown attractions becomes achieved, which from
      Fcrnsehantennen, high voltages and similar high-altitude radiators
      to proceed. Here a list is inful above the space which can be
      screened.<br>
      <br>
      Rod excursions can - depending upon reflector position - up
      and/or. below the effective range at the respective Aufstel does
      not lungsort the Abschirmgertites any longer detected become. <br>
