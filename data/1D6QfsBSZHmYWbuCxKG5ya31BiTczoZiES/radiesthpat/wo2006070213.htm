        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Description of the invention</span><br
          style="font-weight: bold;">
        <br>
        [0003] With the help of the accumulation of biological energy,
        its distribution, transformation the device may be used in
        medical, healing techniques (wellness), physiotherapy,
        scientific research, etc. The aim of the invention is to produce
        an ecologically pure energy field to serve healing and the
        restoration of health without the use of supplementary technical
        &lt;'&gt; devices (dietary source, electric, magnetic,
        electromagnetic devices).<br>
        <br>
        [0004] The device consists of a geometrical body (figure 1)
        which consists of two (or more) geometric forms, pyramids or
        cones, fitted, slipped together spatially at their points, plane
        surfaces or at some other place in which minerals (e.g. amber)
        or any other organic or inorganic material can be located. A
        pyramid according to the mathematic interpretation is understood
        as a body enclosed by a base with many sides and the same number
        of triangles as the base has sides that run up to a single
        point. The device may be constructed of an organic material
        (e.g. wood) or inorganic material. The body itself is fixed to
        the middle of the geometric forms, at a longitudinal, lateral or
        diagonal angle, (to the upper part of the body, its base or
        inside) with the help of a prop fixed to the stand, during which
        the fixing is solved so that it permits the rotation of the
        given structure in various directions. The speed of rotation may
        be varied depending on the aim or task of the operator. The
        structure may also be fixed. In order to create the unique
        conditions of the energy effect, depending on the task the
        structure may also have a cover that encompasses the whole body
        or a part of its circumference. This may be made of organic or
        inorganic material, in various colours and forms (e.g. from
        black coloured textile). Energy is formed around the device with
        a given structure, which may be compared to an extrasense field.
        The device belongs to the sphere of healing techniques,
        non-traditional healing devices, health maintenance (wellness)
        devices and it may be used for the treatment of various
        pathological conditions (e.g. inflammatory joint pain, sleeping
        problems, etc.), to terminate fatigue, to increase the stamina
        of sports people and for research. The technical background of
        the invention<br>
        <br>
        [0005] Patent number RU 2074749 C is a device that initiates an
        energy effect on living objects, which consists of unclosed
        twisted spiral made from wire and may be used for the
        restoration of the energy state of a living object.<br>
        <br>
        [0006] The device according to patent number RU 200505 C serving
        to accumulate biological and cosmic radiation is also known of,
        this is a cylindrical body with grooves made of a dielectric
        material. This device makes it possible to accumulate biological
        and cosmic energy and to use it in healthcare.<br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">[0007] The tasks to be solved
          with the invention</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
        <br>
        [0008] The purpose of the given invention is to create and
        localise an energy field from a natural source, which has an
        effect on the healing of the body and its functional state
        without the use of technical devices. Therefore, in the device
        the biological energy is transformed into biomechanical energy,
        which is implemented by the geometric body, in which two (or
        more) pyramids or cones form a unified geometric body in a way
        that they are inserted into one another (figure 1) and a common
        internal space (figure 1 - 1), which space may be empty or
        filled with minerals (e.g. amber) or any other organic or
        inorganic material, depending on the type of effect determined
        by the condition of the object (e.g. the type of illness of the
        living object). The form and size of the filling material may
        also be varied in accordance with the condition of the object
        (e.g. depending on the type of the illness). Every pyramid is
        fixed to the fixator by its base, point, at a lateral,
        longitudinal or diagonal angle (figure 1 O, O', O", O'"), which
        holds the body in a stable state and with the help of which the
        device can be rotated or fixed in an immobile position.<br>
        <br>
        [0009] Apart from this the fixators of the pyramids or cones
        have to be capable of repositioning and fixing at a lateral,
        longitudinal or diagonal angle, so that the size and form of the
        common internal space of the device can be changed (figure 1 -
        1). The device can also be fixed to stable points (figure 1 O")
        or may be placed on the stand, which can be made of any organic
        or inorganic material (e.g. from wood) (figure 2 - 1). The
        device may also have a cover, which can be made from organic or
        inorganic material and is located on the external surface of the
        geometric body (figure 2 - 3). The structure may have a rotation
        lever in order to rotate the geometric body.<br>

        [0012] Figure 1 displays a picture of the structure in an
        immobile, stable, fixed condition. Figure 2 shows the structure
        with stand and cover.<br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">[0013] The implementation in
          detail.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
        <br>
        [0014] The structure consists of geometric forms (figure 1 - 2,
        figure 2 - 5), their forms may be pyramids, cones, truncated
        cones inserted into one another (figure 1 - 1, figure 2 - 7),
        they have a common space (figure 1 - 1, figure 2 - 7) and in
        this way they form a unified geometric body (figure 1 - 3,
        figure 2 - 6). The geometric forms can be made from any organic
        or inorganic material (e.g. from wood). The internal common
        space (figure 1 - 1, figure 2 - 7) can remain empty or be filled
        with any organic or inorganic material, in any size and shape
        (e.g. egg-shaped amber). Fixators are placed into the structure
        (figure 1 - 4), to which we fix the unified geometric body
        (figure 1 - 3, figure 2 - 6), as compared to the body the
        fixators may be positioned at a lateral, longitudinal, diagonal
        or any other angle. The fixators have supporting clamps on them,
        onto which the geometric forms are suspended. They can be
        suspended on their bases (e.g. onto O" base in figure 1) or onto
        the point (figure 1 - O'"). The external fixators can be rigidly
        fixed (figure 1 - O"), the free movement at the external fixing
        point makes rotation around the axis possible, so the body is
        able to rotate around the axis. The supporting elements and the
        fixators (figure 1 - O', O") make it possible for the geometric
        form to be relocated (figure 1 -2) and to change the whole
        unified geometric body (figure 1 -3) in a lateral, longitudinal
        or diagonal angle for the image and form of the common space
        (figure 1 - 1, figure 2 - 7). The supporting elements and the
        fixators may be made of any material (e.g. from wood). A cover
        may be positioned around the structure (figure 2 - 8) in any
        form, to any extent and in any colour, and made from any
        material desired (e.g. from wood, in a parallelepipedon form,
        from black material). The structure may have a rotation lever
        (figure 2 - 9), which makes it possible to rotate the unified
        geometric body (figure 2 - 6) manually or with the assistance of
        a motor.<br>
        <br>
        [0015] The structure may be of any size.<br>
        <br>
        [0016] The structure works in the following way: the device (or
        two devices) is place directly next to the body of the patient
        of the body area, for general effects next to the head or leg of
        the patient, naturally as is required. In order to charge up the
        effectiveness of the structure 2-3 minutes of rotation are
        required. The rotation must be carried out immediately before
        treatment. The effect may last for 20-30 minutes. The number of
        treatments depends on the problems of the illness that
        determines the aim of the healing. The given therapy may appear
        as a healing, health restoration effect in the case of sleep
        disorders, migraine, allergy, stress, etc. The effectiveness of
        the treatment is determined by the improvement of the well being
        of the patients, the termination of the symptoms and also with
        laboratory tests. Apart from this in the field around the
        structure, a mechanical effect appears in the biolocation frame,
        a mechanical air current is created around the central, common
        space of the body (figure 1 - 1), which can also be sensed
        visually.<br>
        <br>
        [0017] The use of the structure extends the range of
        ecologically pure, energetic health restoration and healing
        methods and it is also possible to use it in research work.<br>
        <br>
        [0018] The structure may be made from any material, but from a
        healing point of view organic materials are more advantageous.<br>
