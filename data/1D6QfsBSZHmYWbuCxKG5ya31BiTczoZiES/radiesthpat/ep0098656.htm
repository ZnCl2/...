      Inventor:&nbsp; GIERKINK ALPHONS JOHANNES<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;"> Abstract </span>-- <strong></strong><span
        style="float: right;" class="btnY"></span>The invention has for
      its object to counteract the negative influence of biologically
      active fields on living organisms and provides for this purpose a
      device for neutralizing such fields, said device comprising an
      electrically conductive strip or wire having an earth connection
      at the middle, said strip or wire being located substantially in
      one plane and being constructed in the form of a ring symmetrical
      to the middle, whilst the ends of the strip or wire are spaced by
      a small distance.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;"> Device for neutralizing
        biologically active fields.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      It is known that many diseases and more or less serious ailments
      cannot be explained or treated by the present-day medical science.<br>
      <br>
      In the non-university and non-conventional scientific practice it
      is supposed that in a number of cases said diseases and ailments
      result from intensity values of local biologically active fields
      which are inadmissibly high for living organisms. Said fields can
      be detected with a high degree of certainty by means of a
      divining-rod. Long years' experience in this domain has shown that
      without preliminary knowledge different diviners give with great
      accuracy the same indications in a given situation.<br>
      <br>
      The invention has for its object to counteract the negative
      influence of said biologically active fields on living organisms
      and provides for this purpose a device for neutralizing such
      fields, said device comprising an electrically conductive strip or
      wire having an earth connection at the middle, said strip or wire
      being located substantially in one plane and being constructed in
      the form of a ring symmetrical to the middle, whilst the ends of
      the strip or wire are spaced by a small distance. <br>
      <br>
      Experience with the divining-rod has in the meantime unambiguously
      proved that the intensity of the biologically active fields can be
      reduced to harmless proportions by using a device embodying the
      invention.<br>
      <br>
      For achieving optimum activity it is preferred to provide
      positioning means for a substantially horizontal disposition of
      the plane of the ring. Very useful is the variant in which the
      positioning means are formed by a ground pin fastened to the earth
      connection, which pin has to be inserted into the ground in a
      position substantially perpendicular to the plane of the ring.<br>
      <br>
      It may be advantageous when the device embodying the invention can
      be carried on the body. For this purpose it may be provided with a
      conductive carrying chain coupled with the earth connection. This
      carrying chain should be in contact with the skin. In this respect
      it is noted that even slight condfivi is sufficient in view of the
      extremely low electric current strength involved, which has been
      known for a long time from literature relating to the
      divining-rod. From practical experience it has been found that
      even poorly conductive rubber soles have a conductive power which
      is sufficient for satisfactory operation of the device embodying
      the invention. It should be noted that a device embodying the
      invention carried around the neck will occupy a more or less
      vertical position so that no optimum results are ensured.In this
      regard, it is preferred to carry the device in a substantially
      horizontal position on the body particularly suitable thereto are
      the shoulders and the feet.<br>
      <br>
      Very satisfactory results have been obtained with a device in
      which the surfaces of the ends of the strip or wire are flat and
      substantially coincide with the plane of symmetry of the ring.<br>
      <br>
      In order to adapt the device to the purpose aimed at and in
      particular to avoid unnecessarily large dimensions it is preferred
      to choose the surface enclosed by the ring on te basis of the
      radius of the described active zone <br>
      <br>
      It will be obvious that the strip or wire may be made of metal.
      Lighter and cheaper may be variant in which the strip or wire has
      a core of, for example, synthetic resin surrounded by an
      electrically conductive layer<br>
      <br>
      A very important enlargement of the working zone is obtained by a
      variant in which the ends of the strip or wire are connected with
      the earth connection by means of electric conductors which may be
      provided with an insulating sheath.<br>
      <br>
      The invention will now be described with reference to the drawing
      of a few arbitrarily chosen embodiments. The drawing shows in<br>

      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>Fig. 1 shows a device 1
      embodying the invention. This device 1 comprises an electrically
      conductive wire 2, to the middle of which is fastened an earth
      terminal 3.<br>
      <br>
      To the earth terminal 3 is secured a ground pin 4 The latter has a
      tip 5 at the lower end so that the pin 4 can be readily inserted
      into the ground in a manner such that the ground pin 4 tomes into
      contact with humid earth or even ground water. The conductor 2 is
      annularly bent so that it is located in one plane, whilst its ends
      7 are at a small distance from one another.<br>
      <br>
      The plane of the conductor 2 is substantially normal to the
      direction of length of the ground pin 4 so that the conductor 2
      can be readily set in a horizontal position.<br>
      <br>
      Fig. 2 shows a second embodiment of the invention. In this
      embodiment a strip 8 has a rectangular cross-section in contrast
      to the first embodiment of Fig. 1 in which the conductor 2 has a
      circular cross-section, whilst the shape of the strip is
      substantially a triangle with rounded-off corners. To one of the
      corners is fastened an earth connection 9 with the ground pin 4.
      On the side opposite said corner the ends of the strip 8 are
      slightly spaced apart.<br>
      <br>
      The third embodiment shown in Fig. 3 comprises a strip 10 of
      pentagonal shape. To one corner is fastened the earth connection 9
      with the ground pin 10. On the opposite side in the middle the
      ends of the strip 10 are slightly spaced apart. The cross-section
      of the strip 10 is generally rectangular.<br>
      <br>
      Fig. 4 shows a fourth embodiment. A round wire 11 has an octogonal
      shape. On one side the earth terminal 3 is arranged with the
      ground pin 4 like in the embodiment of Fig. 1, whilst on the
      opposite side the ends of the wire 11 are located at a small
      distance from one another.<br>
      <br>
      Fig. 5 shows a fifth, simple embodiment in which the conductor 2
      is provided in the middle with an earth terminal 12 to which a
      ground lead 13 is conductively fastened. For practical use this
      simple embodiment has to be disposed in an insulated manner. Only
      the ground lead 13 has to be connected witch the ground. <br>
      <br>
      Fig. 6 shows an elegant embodiment of the device in accordance
      with the invention. A conductive carrying chain 14 serves to carry
      the conductive ring 15, which is conductively connected in the
      middle with the chain 14.<br>
      <br>
      Symmetrically opposite said connection there is a small free space
      16.<br>
      <br>
      Fig. 7 shows a device 17 having an annular conductor 2 to the
      middle of which is secured a conductive carrying rod 18, the lower
      part of which is carried by a relatively heavy foot 19. To the
      carrying rod 18 is fastened a ground lead 20, to the free end of
      which is secured a ground plug 21. This ground plug has the same
      shape as a conventional plug with grounded rim 22, but it is not
      provided with pins so that after insertion into a normal wall
      contact box it can solely serve for grounding purposes.<br>
      <br>
      All embodiments described above are constructed so that the
      surfaces of the ends of the strip or wire are flat and
      substantially coincide with the plane of symmetry of the
      conductive ring.<br>
      <br>
      Fig. 8 shows a variant differing from the embodiment of Fig. 1 by
      the presence of two conductors 23, 24 by which the ends 7 are
      conductively connected with the earth terminal 3.<br>
      <br>
      Fig. 9 shows an embodiment in which a ring 25 can be carried by
      means of a chain 26 on the body like in the embodiment of Fig. 6,
      whilst in accordance with the embodiment of Fig. 8 the ends 26 are
      connected with the middle of the ring 25 by means of conductors 29
      provided with an insulating sheath 28. The operation of this
      embodiment is fully analogous to that of Fig. 8.<br>
      <br>
      Fig. 10 is a schematic representation of the active zone of the
      devices without electric connection between the ends and the earth
      terminal. The curve 28 indicates the border of the working range
      of the device of Fig. 1. It is inserted into the ground 29. The
      device 1 is operative along a depth of, for example, 5 metres,
      whilst the radius of the active zone at the surface may be about
      20 metres.<br>
      <br>
      The curve 37 indicates the boundary of the active zone of the
      device 30 of Fig. 8. From Fig. 10, drawn approximately to scale,
      it appears that the activity in depth is enlarged by 100%, whilst
      the active radius at ground surface has increased by about 30%.<br>
      <br>
      It will be obvious that the embodiments described only serve to
      illustrate the idea of the invention and that the implementation
      depends on the specific purpose of use, that is to say, whether it
      has to be placed in the ground, to be used indoors or to be
      carried on the body, whilst the dimensions may be chosen in
      accordance with a desired active zone. <br>
