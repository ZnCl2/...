            <span style="font-weight: bold;">Apparatus to the treatment
              of organisms and plants by pyramid energy</span></big><br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></div>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
        </span>The invention refers to an apparatus to the treatment of
        organisms and plants by pyramid energy, with which on the tip of
        a pyramid from the top over the pyramid seizing vibration
        absorbers fitted is, which has a power consumption electrode at
        each edge of the pyramid and each flat center line in each case,
        of which from altogether two electrical lines to two Chakra
        electrodes leads. Such an apparatus is subject matter of the
        DE-OS 35 30 841.<br>
        <br>
        The fact that in pyramids any energies work, which mummify for
        example animals and plants were in Egypt the designers of the
        pyramids already known. Also newer experiments, over which in
        the television reported became, show that on the inside from the
        Cheops pyramid full-scale copied pyramids foods hold themselves
        prolonged fresh as bottom otherwise same conditions outside of
        the pyramid.<br>
        <br>
        The DE-OS initially specified 35 30 841 shows, how the so called
        pyramid energy of electrical conductors received and to two
        Chakra electrodes can become passed. If one brings radioactive
        loaded waters between the two Chakra electrodes to an apparatus
        in accordance with the DE-OS mentioned 35 30 841 and measures
        the radioactive impulses by means of a Geiger counter, then it
        can be stated that the pulse number drops within twenty minutes
        of 670 impulses per minute to 560 impulses per minute, while it
        remains with a same water sample outside of the apparatus
        constant.<br>
        <br>
        The before-known Chakra Elektrodenanlage becomes already used in
        the larger circumference the treatment of humans. Since the
        effect of the apparatus depends on the energy present at the
        Chakra electrodes, it is desirable, if can become a received of
        the pyramid as large an amount of power as possible in order to
        have been able to make either relative high amounts of power
        available or however over with as small a pyramid as possible
        still sufficient amounts of power to the order.<br>
        <br>
        The invention is the basis the object to arrange an apparatus
        that in such a manner initially mentioned type that into its
        electrical lines as large a pyramid energy quantity as possible
        can arrive.<br>
        <br>
        This object becomes according to invention dissolved by the fact
        that both high-guided to the Chakra electrodes leading
        electrical lines of the basis of the pyramid are along two edges
        of the pyramid to the vibration absorber.<br>
        <br>
        Surprisingly shown has itself that pyramids at their edges
        radiate an high energy outward, which can become received of the
        lines along-led on them. Experiments with radioactive loaded
        water shown opposite the known apparatus a significant more
        rapid decay of the radioactivity.<br>
        <br>
        An other improvement of the power consumption can be reached, if
        in accordance with an advantageous embodiment of the invention
        of each line leading to the Chakra electrodes individual
        directions lead to each power consumption electrode and
        individual directions of the line are to Chakra electrode in the
        reversed direction of rotation to the power consumption
        electrodes a guided like individual directions of the other
        line.<br>
        <br>
        To the treatment of organisms it is particularly favourable
        whole, if individual directions to the line, which leads to the
        Chakra electrode which can be arranged below the organism which
        can be treated or the plant, by which power consumption
        electrodes in the clockwise direction around the pyramid are led
        around. Such a plant became likewise with radioactive loaded
        water tested and compared with an apparatus to the state of the
        art. It shown itself that the pulse number in the apparatus,
        according to invention measured with a Geiger counter, dropped
        within 20 minutes from 670 impulses to 400 impulses per minute,
        while it dropped with the apparatus after the DE-OS 35 30 841 in
        the same time only on 560 impulses per minute and did not remain
        with not water constant introduced in such an apparatus.<br>
        <br>
        For the treatment of organisms and plants it is favourable, if
        individual directions are connected to the Chakra electrode
        which can be arranged above the organism which can be treated or
        the plant in the smaller radial spacing to the pyramid, as
        individual directions leading to the other Chakra electrode. The
        positive effect of such an apparatus can be proven to
        significant with flowers. These prosper between the
        ChakraElektroden significant faster and better than outside.<br>
        <br>
        The maximization of the energy density the pyramid with an edge
        in north south direction must become aligned. That is
        particularly light possible, if the pyramid on an edition is
        disposed, which on a mobile backing plate disposed pivotable
        around a vertical axis is, which carries a stand at the same
        time to the support of the Chakra electrodes.<br>
        <br>
        Since pyramids radiate energy also with their base surface
        downward, it is favourable for use also this energy, if the
        edition forms the upper limitation of a box, which parallel
        exhibits a mirror directed to the pyramid to the plane of the
        base surface of the pyramid in the pitch to this pyramid. Such a
        mirror the reflected outgoing energy back into the pyramid,
        whereby itself the energy portion of again increased delivered
        into the lines. The further prevented mirror that influenced in
        a multi-storey building below the pyramid located persons become
        in undesirable manner of the pyramid energy.<br>
        <br>
        Particularly effective is the mirror, if he has a pitch, which
        corresponds to the height of the pyramid at least from the base
        surface of the pyramid.<br>
        <br>
        The handling of an apparatus after the invention is particularly
        simple, if the stand consists of square tube and for putting in
        mounting plates for the upper and lower Chakra electrode in
        several, rectangular to each other standing positions formed is.
        With such a stand particularly light ensure leaves itself that
        the electrodes in each use position with one another aligning.<br>
        <br>
        For the therapeutic effect favorable is it, if the line from
        above, leading to the upper Chakra electrode, is anti-clockwise
        rotating seen high-guided at the Stativsäule to the upper Chakra
        electrode.<br>
        <br>
        From same reasons another development of the invention is
        favourable, guided in accordance with which the line from above,
        leading to the lower Chakra electrode, is clockwise rotating
        seen to the lower Chakra electrode.<br>
        <br>
        For the therapeutic treatment of humans it is favorable, if each
        Chakra electrode consists to each other of altogether ten
        parallel disposed single electrodes, which as in the figs 5 and
        6 with Roman digits characterized with the power consumption
        electrodes are in accordance with fig 3 connected.<br>
        <br>
        The invention permits many embodiments. To the other clarity of
        their basic principle two of it in the drawing shown are and
        become subsequent described. This shows in<br>

        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fig. 6</span> a view from in
        front toward the arrow D in fig 1 the Chakra electrode 9b.<br>
        <br>
        In fig 1 the illustrated apparatus has a backing plate 1, which
        3 carriage formed exhibiting as running wheels 2, is. On this
        backing plate 1 is 5 disposed around a vertical axis 4 a
        pivotable edition, on which a pyramid 6 stands. By these swivel
        barkeit the edition 5 is it light possible to align the pyramid
        6 in such a way the fact that their base surface with an edge in
        north south direction runs which for the recovery of large an
        pyramid energy as possible is favourable.<br>
        <br>
        Before the edition 5 a stand formed from square tube is 7
        disposed on the backing plate 1, which an upper Chakra electrode
        8 and a lower Chakra electrode 9 stop ore. Broken shown is an
        other, bottom electrode 9b, which alternative the Chakra
        electrode 9 used can become and rectangular the Chakra electrode
        8 aligned is.<br>
        <br>
        From the top a vibration absorber is 10 fitted on the pyramid 6,
        which on its outer surface altogether eight power consumption
        electrodes 11 and coaxial exhibits to the pyramid point on its
        upper end face an other power consumption electrode 12. Each
        power consumption electrode 11, 12 has one behind the other two
        terminals, from which in each case is closer the intended
        terminal with the lower Chakra electrode 9 electrically
        connected, remote other to the pyramid 6gelegene terminal with
        the upper Chakra electrode 8 and that, of the pyramid.<br>
        <br>
        The type of the electrical wiring results most clearly from the
        figs 2 and 3. Fig 2 shows that a line 13 of the vibration
        absorber 10 is anti-clockwise rotating 8 high-guided seen from
        above along an edge of the pyramid 6 downward guided and then at
        the stand 7 to the upper Chakra electrode. Corresponding one is
        another line 14 of the vibration absorber 10 along another edge
        of the pyramid 6 downward guided and runs without the other line
        13 to cross from above seen clockwise rotatingly to the lower
        Chakra electrode. Tabs 17, 18 on the edition 5 hold the Lei do
        towards 13, 14 on the respective pyramid edge.<br>
        <br>
        In fig 3 it is to be seen that 14 guided of, the outside
        terminals of the radial outward directed power consumption
        electrodes 11 there characterized with II to IX an individual
        direction from above is seen in the clockwise direction around
        the pyramid 6 around to the line in each case. Important one for
        the invention is that the power consumption electrodes are not
        immediate connected with one another, but individual directions
        always of each power consumption electrode without branch to
        another electrode to the line 14 guided are.<br>
        <br>
        The line 13, which leads to the upper Chakra electrode 8, shown
        in the figs 1 and 2, is the corresponding line 14 with the power
        consumption electrodes connected, whereby the direction of
        rotation of individual directions however reversed, thus against
        the clockwise direction, runs, which was clarified in fig 2 and
        3 by rectangular small boxes with registered, Roman digits and
        in fig 3 additional by arrows.<br>
        <br>
        With the embodiment in accordance with the fig 4 the pyramid 6
        stands on around the axis 4 pivotable 1 box 15 disposed on the
        backing plate. In the box 15 parallel and congruently to the
        basis of the pyramid 6 upward more directed, planner mirror 16
        disposed, are whose pitch of the basis of the pyramid 6
        corresponds at least to the height of the pyramid 6.<br>
        <br>
        The fig 5 shows, how ten single electrodes of the Chakra
        electrode 8 with the corresponding power consumption electrodes
        connected, characterized characterized with Roman digits I to X,
        in fig 3 with Roman digits are. The lower Chakra electrode 9 is
        like that connected with the power consumption electrodes that
        its Einzelelek connected with a power consumption electrode
        troden in each case with that single electrode aligning, which
        is connected with the same power consumption electrode.<br>
        <br>
        The fig 6 shows, how the single electrodes of the horizontal
        aligned Chakra electrode are to be connected 9b with the power
        consumption electrodes.<br>
