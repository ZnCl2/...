      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract</span> -- Device for
      neutralizing the effects of electromagnetic fields inside areas
      and/volumes in which said fields occur, consisting of a pyramid
      (1) having as its base a rhombus (2), the greater diagonal (D1)
      and smaller diagonal (d2) of which are respectively of a length
      such as to give rise to a so-called golden ratio D1/d2, and also
      of a height (h) such as to give rise to a ratio h/D1 also of the
      golden type, there also being provided at least one pair of arms
      (3) and (4) respectively parallel to the greater diagonal (D1) and
      to the smaller diagonal (d2) and respectively joining pairs of
      opposite edges (1a,1c,1b,1d) of the pyramid (1), said arms (3,4)
      supporting in the region of said edges respective containers
      (3N,3S,4E,4W) designed to contain a predetermined quantity of a
      liquid and intersecting in the region of a further, central,
      container (5) arranged along the height of the pyramid. <br>
      <br>
      The present invention relates to a process and an associated
      device for neutralizing the effects of electromagnetic fields
      inside areas and/or volumes inside which said fields occur.<br>
      <br>
      It is known that the presence of electromagnetic fields of any
      origin inside areas and/or volumes gives rise to environmental
      pollution phenomena which are harmful both for any vegetation as
      well as for fauna and man.<br>
      <br>
      It is known, for example, that the prolonged exposure of the eyes
      to the rays of a video terminal such as that of a computer is
      harmful for the eyes themselves and it is also known that
      agriculture fields exposed to the electromagnetic waves of
      high-voltage lines are affected, with a reduction in the
      productivity of the crops.<br>
      <br>
      The technical problem which is posed, therefore, is that of
      neutralizing the effects of electromagnetic fields present inside
      open areas and/or volumes such as closed environments in order to
      reduce significantly the harmful effects of said electromagnetic
      fields.<br>
      <br>
      These results are obtained by the present invention which
      envisages a process for neutralizing the effects of
      electromagnetic fields inside areas and/or volumes in which said
      fields occur, which comprises the following phases:<br>
      <br>
      determination of the direction of North-South orientation of the
      area "A" subject to the electromagnetic field,<br>
      corresponding determination of the direction of East-West
      orientation of the same area,<br>
      determination of a segment arranged along the orientation N-S and
      of a segment arranged along E-W such that they constitute
      respectively the greater diagonal D2 and the smaller diagonal d3
      of a rhombus 6 inside which the area subject to neutralization
      treatment is inscribed and such that their ratio is of the golden
      type;<br>
      arrangement, in the region of each vertex N,E,S,W, of the
      above-defined rhombus, of a pyramid device according to the
      present invention (1N,1E,1S,1W), each oriented with the larger
      diagonal parallel to the direction N-S,<br>
      arrangement, in the containers (3N,3S,4E,4W) corresponding to the
      respective cardinal point at which they are located, of a liquid,
      vibration of which resonates with the specific frequency of the
      cardinal point in question, i.e.:<br>
      North: frequencies C = 10 Hz ; E = 40 Hz<br>
      South: frequencies A = 2.5 Hz ; G = 160 Hz<br>
      East: frequency D = 20 Hz<br>
      West: frequencies B = 5 Hz ;F = 80 Hz,<br>
      <br>
      arrangement of a further pyramid device (1C) at the centre of the
      above-defined rhombus,<br>
      arrangement, in the central container (5C) of said pyramid (1C),
      of a predetermined quantity of liquid, the vibration frequency of
      which resonates with a reference frequency D = 20 Hz.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention also relates to a device for neutralizing
      the effects of electromagnetic fields inside areas and/or volumes
      in which said fields occur, consisting of a pyramid having as its
      base a rhombus, the larger and smaller diagonals of which are
      respectively of a length such as to give rise to a so-called
      golden ratio and also of a height such as to give rise to a ratio
      also of the golden type, there being provided moreover at least
      one pair of arms respectively parallel to the larger diagonal and
      to the smaller diagonal and respectively joining pairs of opposite
      edges of the pyramid, said arms supporting in the vicinity of said
      edges respective containers designed to contain a predetermined
      quantity of a liquid and intersecting in the region of a further,
      central, container arranged along the height of the pyramid.<br>
      <br>
      Further details may be obtained from the following description,
      with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Figure 1</span> shows a
      perspective view of the device for neutralizing electromagnetic
      fields according to the invention, and<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Figure 2</span> shows a diagram
      illustrating application of the process to a predetermined area.<br>
      <br>
      As shown in Figure 1, the device according to the invention
      consists of a pyramid 1 made of conductive material such as
      copper, zinc or silver/gold having as its base a rhombus 2, the
      greater diagonal D1 and smaller diagonal d2 of which are
      respectively of a length such as to give rise to a so-called
      golden ratio D1/d2, i.e. such that the value of the ratio is equal
      to the square root of the ratio between the difference of the
      squares of D1 and d2 and the square of d2.<br>
      <br>
      The pyramid also has a height h such as to give rise to a ratio
      h/D1 also of the golden type, i.e. such that the value of the
      ratio is equal to the square root of the ratio between the
      difference of the squares of h and D1 and the square of h.<br>
      <br>
      Moreover, inside the pyramid there are provided arms 3 and 4
      respectively parallel to the greater diagonal D1 and smaller
      diagonal d2 and joining the opposite edges 1a, 1c and 1b, 1d,
      respectively.<br>
      <br>
      Said arms 3 and 4 support, in the vicinity of said edges,
      respective containers 3N, 3S and 4E, 4W designed to contain a
      predetermined quantity of a liquid described in more detail below.<br>
      <br>
      Moreover, it is envisaged that said arms 3 and 4 are connected to
      a further liquid container 5 arranged at the point of intersection
      of the arms themselves, located along the height of the pyramid.<br>
      <br>
      The said liquid contained in the associated container is called
      active water and consists of particular types of water having
      vibration frequences resonating with particular reference
      frequences which are typical of the resonance of biological tissue
      in light and can be measured with instruments known as "GIR" or
      microlasers.<br>
      <br>
      Said reference frequences are seven in number and identified by a
      letter of the alphabet and by a value in Hz.<br>
      <br>
      The processes for identifying and reproducing said types of water
      have already being dealt with in previous patent applications in
      the name of the same Applicant and will not be described further,
      except in order to specify the particular frequencies to be used
      in relation to the neutralization process which will be described
      below.<br>
      <br>
      With reference to Figure 2, a description is given below of the
      process for neutralizing the effects of electromagnetic fields
      ascertained beforehand by means of verification of the type of
      alteration induced by the magnetic field on the specific resonance
      frequencies of each cardinal point in relation to specific
      predetermined reference values; the process comprises the
      following phases:<br>
      <br>
      determination of the direction of North-South orientation of the
      area "A" subject to the electromagnetic field,<br>
      corresponding determination of the direction of East-West
      orientation of the same area,<br>
      determination of a segment arranged along the orientation N-S and
      of a segment arranged along E-W such that they constitute
      respectively the greater diagonal D2 and smaller diagonal d3 of a
      rhombus 6 inside which the area subject to neutralization
      treatment is inscribed and such that their ratio is of the golden
      type as defined above,<br>
      arrangement, in the region of each vertex N,E,S,W of the
      above-defined rhombus, of a pyramid device according to the
      present invention 1N,1E,1S,1W, respectively, all oriented with the
      greater diagonal parallel to the direction N-S,<br>
      arrangement, in the containers 3N,3S,4E,4W corresponding to the
      respective cardinal point at which they are located, of a liquid,
      vibration of which resonates with the specific frequency of the
      cardinal point in question, i.e.:<br>
      <br>
      North: frequencies C = 10 Hz ; E = 40 Hz<br>
      South: frequencies A = 2.5 Hz ; G = 160 Hz<br>
      East: frequency D = 20 Hz<br>
      West: frequencies B = 5 Hz ; F = 80 Hz,<br>
      <br>
      arrangement of a further pyramid device 1C at the centre of the
      above-defined rhombus 6, arrangement in the central container 5C
      of said pyramid 1C, of a predetermined quantity of liquid, the
      vibration frequency of which resonates with a reference frequency
      D = 20 Hz.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably the neutralization cycle has a duration of 28 days
      which can be calculated from any day on which the cycle is
      started; it is preferred, however, to start the treatment cycle on
      the third day preceding the day on which there is a full moon;
      correspondingly, the quantity of liquid to be arranged in the
      associated containers must be such that it lasts for the entire
      period even with respect to the different atmospheric conditions,
      although the process is not affected by any periodic topping-up of
      the said liquids.<br>
      <br>
      At the end of the 28-day treatment period the neutralization
      effects obtained can be verified by checking again the individual
      frequencies of each single cardinal point and repeating, if
      necessary, neutralization cycles in order to maintain the renewed
      frequency equilibrium obtained.<br>
      <br>
      Many variants may be introduced during realization of the
      component parts of the invention, without thereby departing from
      the protective scope of the present invention as defined in the
      claims which follow.<br>
