      <div style="text-align: left;">Inventor: HANS BRUEGEMANN GMBH<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
        Such probes with body electrode are known and come before all
        things for therapeutic purposes to the use. A known therapy
        procedure plans it to strengthen the bio alternating field in
        one, detected of the body of an patient with an acceptance
        probe, the probe downstream metre to diagnose and provide
        feeding back with the calculated complement either over the same
        acceptance probe or over an other particular<br>
        <br>
        To impress embossing probe the body of the patient again.<br>
        <br>
        The known probes of the type initially specified are plate
        shaped, similar formed as electrocardiogram probes and with that<br>
        <br>
        Disadvantage of a relative poor efficiency f r the detection and
        impressing of bio alternating fields afflicted. Practical
        complete inappropriate is these disk probes to the coupling at
        limb, particularly at fingers of the patient. In view of this
        state of the art the innovation the object is the basis to
        create a probe initially specified the universal is more
        insertable and practicing ore RA gung and detection of bio
        alternating fields with sufficient good efficiency an ensured.<br>
        <br>
        This object becomes 1 dissolved in conformity with the features
        of the characterizing part of the claim.<br>
        <br>
        The core of the innovation consists thus in the provision of a
        coiled and at least essentially cantilevered body electrode,
        which proved in the practical experiment as extremely favourable
        to the therapy, there it allowed to seize those relative weak
        bio alternating fields with good efficiency and/or. to
        transmitted.<br>
        <br>
        From the principle of a coiled body electrode probes in the most
        diverse forms can be derived, so that an universal use of the
        innovation-in accordance with-eaten probe is ensured.<br>
        <br>
        In accordance with a first advantageous embodiment the body
        electrode is coiled as planar spiral. This electrode shape is
        suitable before all things for therapeutic purposes at the torso
        of the patient.<br>
        <br>
        To the coupling of the innovation-in accordance with-eaten probe
        is the body electrode favourable-proves as into the space
        screwing<br>
        <br>
        Spiral coiled, whereby this three-dimensional spiral is at least
        so far cantilevered or form-stable that successive spiral turns
        in the sense of a shortcircuit do not arrive themselves with one
        another affecting in contact. The three-dimensional spiralwind
        as such is adaptable in his shape on various manner to the
        respective therapy purpose. Sports club is it favourable-proves
        provided, spiralwinds cylindrical tapered to train. An other
        favourable design of the Spiralwickels plans a conical winding
        process. Other favourable variations of the filament winding
        concern different slopes of the Spiralwickels.<br>
        <br>
        Are from large therapeutic importance the direction-controlled
        detection and transmission of bio alternating fields.<br>
        <br>
        This problem is elegantly more releasable with the help of the
        innovation-in accordance with-eaten probe by the fact that
        spiralwind different rotary, i.e. preferably anti-clockwise
        rotating or clockwise rotatingly formed is. Beyond that it can
        spiralwinds for the innovation-in accordance with-eaten probe
        with one another by the fact combine will that these coils are
        into one another of the plug-in type against each other
        insulated disposed. The combination of two against-intimate
        rotary spiral windings is particularly favourable.<br>
        <br>
        To the coupling of measuring conduits a SteckanschluB, for
        example for banana plugs of the measuring conduit, is formed at
        the inner spiral end spiralwinds. With a favourable embodiment
        one plug-in connection case is to the spiral end soldered and
        essentially axial to spiralwinds aligned. With an other variant
        it is provided to attach the plug-in connection radial outward
        offset C at the spiral end. An integral proves straight weak bio
        alternating fields relative with view on those<br>
        <br>
        Embodiment of the plug-in connection at the spiral end as
        particularly favourable. Thus a transition resistance between
        plug-in connection and spiral end becomes avoided, which can
        affect the sensitive alternating fields adverse.<br>
        <br>
        For a lossless alternating field version and alternating field
        transmission is it from critical importance, spiralwinds of a
        sufficient good conductive material to make.<br>
        <br>
        Particularly appropriate proved to brass, copper and steel.
        Likewise in the best way appropriate are spiralwind from noble
        metals.<br>
        <br>
        Prefered ones are however from economic reasons spiralwind from
        brass, copper and steel, which gilded or silvered are.<br>
        <br>
        Favourable way are let us spiralwind from a flat band material
        or from wire with round cross section coiled.<br>
        <br>
