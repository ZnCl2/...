      Inventor:&nbsp; BERGMANN HERMANN<br>
      EC:&nbsp;&nbsp; H05F7/00<br>
      <br>
      The device has a plate (1) provided with a number of pyramids (2),
      with a pin (4) positioned centrally under the peak of each
      pyramid, supported by an electrically-conductive collector plate
      (3). A pair of electrical leads (5,6) extend between the collector
      plate and the fuel feed for the i.c. engine, or the engine block,
      or between the collector plate and the electric motor leads, or
      the electric motor housing. Pref. the individual pyramids are made
      of Cu sheet and arranged in a matrix with eight pyramids in each
      direction. Magnets may be inserted in the leads between the
      collector plate and the i.c. engine or electric motor.<br>
      <br>
      <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="ep0673185a.jpg" alt=""></div>
      <br>
      The invention relates to an apparatus in accordance with the
      preamble of the principal claim.
      <p>The invention is the basis the object to use itself the force
        picture formed in a pyramid to the increase of the performance
        of engines. </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>This the invention underlying object becomes dissolved by the
        teaching of the principal claim. </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Favourable embodiments are explained&nbsp; in the Description.
      </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>With other words expressed suggests the invention a plate
        shaped accumulation of small pyramids existing from copper
        sheet, so that for example a square plate of 2,525 mm&lt; of
        2&gt; formed becomes. This plate exhibits preferably 8 x 8 small
        pyramids, whereby the plate becomes formed by the pyramids. In
        the edge region of the outside pyramids an attaching bracket is
        provided, which does not only carry the pyramid plate, but at
        its horizontal flange an header plate connected is, which
        attaches bottom interposition of not conductive materials, as
        for example wood or plastic at this flange however. </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>This header plate carries a so called collecting pin from
        electrical conductive material for central bottom each pyramid
        point, whereby the header plate likewise consists of electrical
        conductive material, and the header plate exhibits two leads
        from electrical conductive material. If one closes now these two
        conduits, for example at the fuel inlet to an internal
        combustion engine, found must become surprisingly that itself
        thereby the fuel consumption of the motor with same performance
        reduced. </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Experiments resulted in that it is also possible, to attach
        these conduits more immediate at the engine block whereby the
        same good results become likewise achieved. The same occurs also
        if one attaches the conduits to the electrical lead of an
        electrical engine. </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>One can increase the increase in efficiency still by the fact
        that one switches magnets on, which improve the obvious energy
        flow in the conduits into the electrical conductive lines. </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>An embodiment of the invention becomes subsequent explained. </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The drawing shows thereby a cutout from a plate, which becomes
        from single, preferably pyramids existing from coppers formed.
        To the better understanding it is pointed out that the plate
        inserted in the practice exhibited a size of 251.2 mm. It was
        square formed, so that the plate became by 8 x 8 pyramids 2
        formed existing from coppers. The strength of this plate becomes
        by the plate 1 ambient Stahlwinkel provided, whose horizontal
        flange is outward directed and an header plate 3 does not carry
        bottom interposition of electrical conductive spacers 8, which
        likewise consists of electrical conductive material. </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Hereby then thus no electrical lead between the actual plate 1
        and the header plate 3 exists. </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>On the header plate 3 are central the bottom pyramid point
        aligned, so called collecting pins from electrical conductive
        material. Further 3 two conduits attach 5 and 6 from electrical
        conductive material to the header plate, which - as the already
        described became - to the fuel inlet of an internal combustion
        engine, to the engine block of an internal combustion engine, to
        the electrical lead of a Elektromotores or to the housing of a
        Elektromotores leads. </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Into these conduits not represented magnets can be switched on
        in the drawing, by which the energy flow in these conduits is
        still improved. </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Subsequent one is shown a test evaluation:</p>
      <p> A passenger car AUDI 100 quattro 2.8 E, flagstone X-X-1704
        became tested over a period of three weeks regarding road
        performance and consumption. The vehicle was equipped during the
        first two weeks without, in the last week with structural
        change.<br>
        <br>
        1.) Test without structural change<br>
      </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The additional load amounted to in the test 1: approx. 60 kg
        and. 1 person. </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> The average external temperature around 7.30 clock amounted to
        during test 1,9.7&lt; o&gt; C. The route amounted to 1,834 km,
        the consumption 248 l. </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The average consumption amounted to 13.56 l/100 km. </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The vehicle worked inertial and few elastic.<br>
      </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> The motor ran as V6-Motor relative out of round.<br>
        <br>
        2.) Test with structural change<br>
      </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>At the latter part of the experiment a cross-country travel
        became performed. Here became approx. 300 motorway and 200
        highway kilometers of traveled. The vehicle was occupied with
        four persons. The driving fashion was right briskly to approx.
        220 km/h, the average speed amount approx. 120 km/h, the
        external temperature 5&lt; o&gt; C. </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The average consumption amounted to 11.65 1/100 km (486
        km/56,63 l). </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The test became after best knowledge and discretion performed,
        the results regarding elasticity and passage ability is pure
        subjective.<br>
