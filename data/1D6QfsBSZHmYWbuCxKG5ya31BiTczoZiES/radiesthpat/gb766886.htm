      <span style="font-weight: bold;"> Abstract </span>-- <strong></strong><span
        style="float: right;" class="btnY"></span> A device for
      screening the body from dowsing rays or fields comprises a
      foundation 4 of paper or other suitable material to which is
      secured rings 1 or loops of metal wire or foil arranged in a
      comtiion plane so that they do not touch one another. The rings 1
      or loops may be made of copper wire or foil and each ring may be
      broken to form a gap 2.<br>
      <br>
      <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="gb766886.jpg" alt=""></div>
      <br>
      The present invention relates to a device for screening or
      neutralising dowsing rays or fields which are known to have
      harmful qualities which have detrimental affects on people
      suffering from functional disorders such as rheumatism, bronchial
      troubles and other ailments.<br>
      <br>
      These rays or fields exist generally in all kinds of localities
      and in both towns and in the country and their source appears to
      be in the upper layers of the atmosphere or outer space. The rays
      appear to have an affinity for underground veins of water, heavy
      clay, radioactive deposits and so on and is therefore more
      concentrated immediately over these deposits. The weather factor
      has some effect on these rays which vary in intensity and
      polarisation.<br>
      <br>
      Most people are inherently sensitive physically to these fields
      and it is the main object of the present invention to provide a
      device which will act to screen people from these fields or rays
      and also to neutralise such fields or rays so that they are
      rendered ineffective or comparatively so.<br>
      <br>
      According to the present invention there is provided a device for
      the purpose referred to which comprises a foundation of paper or
      other suitable material to which is secured a multiplicity of
      loops or rings of metal wire or foil arranged generally in a close
      formation in a common plane in such a manner that the rings do not
      touch one another.<br>
      <br>
      Copper has been found to be one suitable material for the rings or
      loops but other suitable materials may of course be used.<br>
      <br>
      The invention will be more fully described with reference to the
      accompanying drawing which illustrates a preferred form of the
      device.<br>
      <br>
      Referring to the drawings, the rings or loops are arranged in a
      desired formation or pattern on a foundation sheet as closely
      together as possible without touching so as to form a screen 3.<br>
      <br>
      Complete rings of copper foil or wire are effective to some extent
      but the screen ing and neutralising of the rays or fields is more
      efficient if the continuity of each ring is broken so as to leave
      a small gap 2 which may be about a quarter of an inch.<br>
      <br>
      When manufacturing the screen 3 it has been found to be convenient
      to mount the metal rings or loops 1 on a foundation material 4
      such as paper or other suitable material so that the gaps 2 of all
      the rings 1 face in the same direction. The facing of the gaps in
      a common direction however is not essential.<br>
      <br>
      It is however particularly desirable that the metal rings or loops
      1 should all be contained generally in the same common plane as it
      has been found that a discrepancy of a quarter of an inch in the
      plane of one ring or loop relative to the others will considerably
      reduce the screening and neutralising properties.<br>
      <br>
      When the rings or loops 1 are formed of copper foil it is
      convenient to apply these rings or loops to a foundation material
      4 by means of adhesive.<br>
      <br>
      From experiments it has been found that very satisfactory results
      are obtained by making the rings or loops 1 so that they are five
      inches in diameter but this is not critical as in fact these rings
      may be any suitable size say anything from four and a half inches
      in diameter to three feet. <br>
      <br>
      In use the screens are mounted over the patient's bed either by
      sticking them to the ceiling or laying them on the floor of the
      room above, which is the more convenient.<br>
      <br>
      Within reasonable limits the vertical height of the screen above
      the patient does not make any difference.<br>
      <br>
      It will be appreciated of course that a screen may be constructed
      from one or more strips of paper or other foundation material
      bearing said copper rings or loops, said strips being secured
      together edge to edge in any suitable manner so as to extend over
      the required area.<br>
      <br>
      Referring to the small gap 2 in the ring, it has also been found
      that screening and neutralising may be obtained by having the ends
      of the rings overlapping but not touching, i.e. one free end of
      the ring passes and lies. underneath the other free end.<br>

        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The present invention relates to a device for screening or
      neutralising radionic fields.<br>
      <br>
      Radionic fields, including radiations commonly referred to as
      dowsing rays, are known to have harmful qualities which have
      detrimental effects on people suffering from functional disorders
      such as rheumatism, bronchial troubles and other ailments.<br>
      <br>
      These harmful radionic rays and fields exist generally in all
      kinds of localities and in both towns and in the country. The
      source of this radiation appears to be in the upper layers of the
      atmosphere or outer space, and may or may not have some connection
      with cosmic radiation. The radiation appears to have an affinity
      for underground veins of water, heavy clay, radioactive deposits
      and so on, therefore it is more concentrated immediately over
      these features. The weather factor has some effect on these rays
      which vary in intensity and polarisation.<br>
      <br>
      Most people are inherently sensitive to these fields in a
      radiesthetic sense and suffer organic reflexes and it is the main
      object of the present invention to provide a device which will act
      to screen people from these rays and also to neutralise such rays
      that they are rendered ineffective or comparatively so.<br>
      <br>
      According to the present invention there is provided a device for
      the purpose referred to which comprises a foundation of paper or
      other suitable material which serves to support loops or rings of
      metal wire or foil arranged in a required formation or pattern so
      as to extend over and cover a desired area.<br>
      <br>
      Copper has been found to be one suitable material for the rings or
      loops but other suitable materials may of course be used.<br>
      <br>
      From experiments it has been found that very satisfactory results
      are obtained by making the rings or loops so that they are five
      inches in diameter but this is not critical as in fact these rings
      may be anything from four and a half inches in diameter to three
      feet.<br>
      <br>
      Each loop or ring is preferably circular and the rings are
      arranged as closely together as possible but without touching or
      over-lapping.<br>
      <br>
      Complete rings of copper are effective to some extent but the
      screening and neutralising of the radionic fields is more
      efficient if the continuity of each ring is broken so as to leave
      a small gap which may be about a quarter of an inch.<br>
      <br>
      When manufacturing the screen it has been found to be convenient
      to mount the metal rings or loops on a foundation material such as
      paper or other suitable material so that the gaps of all the rings
      face in the same direction. This however is not essential.<br>
      <br>
      It is however particularly desirable that the metal rings or loops
      should all be contained in the same common plane as it has been
      found that a discrepancy of a quarter of an inch in the level of
      one loop relative ...<br>
