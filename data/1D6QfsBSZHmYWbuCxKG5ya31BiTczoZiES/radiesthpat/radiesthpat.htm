        Abstract</span> -- Antennas - bar antennas, V-shaped
      multiple-bar antennas, spirals, in connection with tubular sleeves
      which serve as wave guides and are or may be equipped with a
      ground reflector to increase their effect, emit all around a
      deflecting radiation or an interference radiation in the upright
      position in conjunction with a directional reflector mounted at
      the top, charged by a geopathic wave field. This radiation is
      capable in its effective range of drifting or neutralising other
      interfering stimuli/radiation caused by further interference zones
      (water veins, etc.). In the case of interference
      radiation/deflection radiation directed downwards due to a
      corresponding reflector shape there is no rod deflection above the
      erection site. In the case of interference radiation/deflection
      radiation directed upwards due to a corresponding reflector shape
      there is no rod deflection below the erection site. The effective
      range is influenced by the size of the antenna, the charge thereof
      (interference zone crossing) and by the shape of the reflector
      screen.<br>

        Abstract</span> -- <strong></strong>The device comprises, for
      example, a pyramid of dielectric material having the dimensions,
      as true to scale as possible, of the Cheops pyramid and in a size
      corresponding to the use to which it is put. The collector effect
      of the pyramid, one edge of which is to be aligned to magnetic
      north, bundles the positive pole energy of the magnetic earth
      field in the energy core of the device. As in a mirror image,
      "reflected" force fields with negative energy result above and
      below the pyramid. a) By appropriately positioning a person in,
      above or underneath the pyramid it is possible to supply the
      bundled energy resulting from the collector effect of the pyramid
      to the person in order to balance out energy disturbances of the
      body. b) If the subject-matter of the application is used for the
      continuous automatic material recovery a pyramid of appropriate
      size is to be fitted over the metal part (e.g. bearing) in such a
      way that the part is located within the energy core of the pyramid
      and the pyramid is aligned to the direction of magnetic
      north/south.<br>

      in the inward direction is 40 to 60 % smaller on each full
      revolution than the previous distance. On average, therefore, this
      gives: for the spiral radius measured at 90 DEG : R'1 = R1-R2/4;

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract --</span> The present
      invention includes an apparatus and method for generating,
      duplicating, and transmitting biophotonic radio frequencies that
      propagate along the atmospheric boundary layer of the human skin
      and the earth's atmosphere. These biophotonic radio frequencies
      are applied to a human patient for therapeutic purposes. This
      function is realized with the use of a series of oscillators
      (i.e., electronic function generators) designed to produce
      modulated or unmodulated sine and square wave photons. The
      oscillators are further adapted to emit the modulated or
      unmodulated sine and square wave photons from a dielectric or
      metal antenna built as loops into the walls of a
      diamagnetic-paramagnetic chamber. When a person is seated in the
      chamber, the photons of energy from the waves generated along the
      loop antenna penetrate the human body and provide a variety of
      therapeutic benefits. Among these therapeutic benefits are relief
      of rheumatic muscular pain, slowing the metabolism, increasing the
      efficiency of the immune system, eliminating certain psychosomatic
      ailments, and suppressing cancer.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract </span>-- In a device
      for the treatment of living beings and plants with pyramidal
      energy, the energy is picked up on energy pick-up lines (12, 13),
      which are arranged electrically separate along the four edges of
      the pyramid (6). Since the emission of energy is particularly
      strong along the pyramid edges, a particularly large amount of
      energy can be picked up by energy pick-up lines (12, 13) of this
      type. Such energy pick-up lines (12, 13) are considerably cheaper
      to produce. <br>

      includes a method for influencing the degree of order of an
      inorganic or organic system by using the change, occurring in the
      active region of a hollow pyramid, in the sub-region of the
      terrestial magnetic field otherwise prevailing there, by directing
      the terrestial magnetic subfield to at least one hollow pyramid
      face, which is inclined essentially at the local inclination
      angle, is aligned together with the inclination plane with the
      magnetic north-south direction and is formed from diamagnetic
      material, on to the system, which is preferably brought into the
      interior, below or in the immediate vicinity of the pyramid, and
      exposing the system to the influence of the pyramid in essence
      over the duration of its natural development time. In addition,
      the invention includes a hollow pyramid for carrying out this
      method, in which at least one pyramid face is inclined at the
      inclination angle which is decisive for the application site, and
      at least this pyramid face consists of diamagnetic material having
      a volumetric susceptibility below -15. The hollow pyramid
      preferably consists of brass, zinc, silver, bismuth, graphite or
      ytterbium with in each case a volumetric susceptibility of below
      -15, or else of an alloy or composition of these materials. The
      method according to the invention is suitable for improving the
      formation of crystals in solutions, cultivating microorganisms
      (microbes), improving the germination of seeds...<br>

      its qualitative biological and structural equivalence to the
      harmonical system of the cosmos and especially, according to
      Kepler, of the solar system. Its construction starts from the
      assumption of all high religions and high cultures that the good
      part of the cosmos as a whole - as creation of God - and therefore
      with all its parts is an integral unit of life. Harmonic equipment
      that bears a qualitative structural resemblence to life and, in
      particular, is capable of electromagnetic vibrations, must
      therefore process biologically the same cosmic life forces as it
      has to transmit inductively, which experience shows occur
      everywhere in the cosmos, especially in the form of vibrations.<br>

            right;" class="btnY"></span>Radiation switch for radiation
          deflection and irradiation. b) Radiation surface suction probe
          for radiation deflection and irradiation. The patent
          specification for which a patent is applied is the combined
          result of my many years of research into environmentally
          harmful radiation returning to the sun. In fairly high
          concentration it is visible as livid-coloured light having a
          frequency of 40,000 mm. Livid radiation reflectors are
          produced and assembled by the industry over an uncontrolled,
          immense area. When used conscientiously and in a controlled
          manner, the switches and probes listed in the patent
          specification are suitable for preventing vegetation damage to
          man, animals, trees and plants. Measurable: with a 50 cm long
          golden chain on which a golden ring is threaded, shortened to
          25 cm. The harmful radiation intensity starts at a pendulum
          deflection of 1 cm which leads absolutely to death of the
          vegetation. Optically: photo/video: falsification of the
          spectral colours by superposition of the livid light. This
          livid radiation knows no obstacles. It can only be prevented
          by application and extension by experts of the law governing
          radiation protection.<br>

        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract</span> -- The
        invention relates to medical equipment which is directed at
        neutralising damaging effects produced by data display devices,
        more specifically terminal display devices, TV sets etc, and can
        be used for video devices, computers and power devices. Said
        invention can be also used for protecting against the negative
        effects of geopathogenic zones and geobiological systems. The
        inventive method is based on an additional field (radiation)
        having the opposite direction of a spin polarisation within the
        volume of the field. Said field is produced by the data display
        device. In addition, a supplementary compensating spin field
        having a right polarisation of environmental space is created
        with the aid of a physical vacuum polariser having a right
        polarisation which is based on the effect of prepolarisation of
        the polariser's substance. The inventive device comprises a
        compensating element embodied in the form of at least two
        coaxial sockets which are arranged on a common base. The
        internal socket has the lower of the dimensions d of the cross
        section thereof, which is equal to d&gt; 0,5 H, where H
        represents the height of the socket. Said coaxial sockets have
        the cross section chosen from a range consisting of a polygon
        with the side number thereof m &gt;= 3, a circle, a rotary body
        having an arbitrary shape and the combination of said figures.
        The walls of the sockets are embodied in such a way that they
        are sharp-edged on the side of the free ends thereof.<br>

        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract</span> -- A method for
        influencing an object participating in a technological process
        consists in directing an external energy on an intermediate
        element which changes its functional state and influences the
        object participating in the technological process, and the
        influence is formed as a secondary radiation which is
        interconnected with the external energy and which is generated
        from the substance contained in the material of the intermediate
        element. The formation of the secondary radiation flow with
        desired parameters is effected by periodical variation of the
        vector of anisotropy of the substance of the intermediate
        element and the thus formed flow of the secondary radiation is
        directed on the object.; The device comprises an external energy
        source (2) and an intermediate element (3) capable of generating
        an influence in the form of secondary radiation matching with
        the external energy from the source (2) and resulting from the
        periodical change of the vector of anisotropy of the substance
        contained in the material of the intermediate element (3). The
        device is used as apparatus for programmed stimulation of
        self-regulation of biological objects for correction of their
        functional state.<br>

          style="float: right;" class="btnY"></span>The invention
        relates to a device for changing radiesthetically measurable
        fields with the object of avoiding the pathogenic effects of
        their biologically active regions, the so-called irritant zones.
        These fields are mainly caused by underground water veins.
        However, they are also found in space lattice-like structures,
        the so-called lattice systems incident from the atmosphere. All
        the measures and devices known to date for attenuating or
        eliminating the effect of the irritant zones have shortcomings
        or disadvantages. As a rule, they are ineffective with regard to
        the particularly dangerous crossing region of the irritant
        zones, or they detect only individual frequencies and must be
        adjusted with the risk of inefficacy due to maladjustment. The
        invention is based on the object of creating a device for
        changing radiesthetically measurable fields which avoids the
        aforesaid disadvantages. This object is achieved using a
        pyramidal body in that one or more elements, e.g. another
        pyramidal body, or an element which is resonant in the microwave
        range, e.g. a spiral, or a homeopathic preparation, is arranged
        within or directly underneath this body.<br>
