      Inventor: DUPIN JACQUES<br>
      <br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract</span> -- <strong></strong><span
        style="float: right;" class="btnY"></span>Device ensuring
      physiological protection against the harmful effects of telluric
      and cosmic waves. The invention is constituted by one or several
      oscillating circuits formed of rings associated with a bar
      parallel to their plane and extending on either side, the said
      device being placed horizontally oriented northwards. It is in
      this way that the device can comprise the rings 1 to 5 centred,
      side by side, on a single bar 6 or concentric according to 7 to 10
      associated with the bar 11, their effect differing in power
      according to the disposition adopted. The invention can be used to
      increase physiological comfort and to improve health.<br>
    </div>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Without entering the study of the
      causes of the presence of the electromagnetic and electrostatic
      fields which wrap the terrestrial sphere, each one can note their
      existence, whose sources are many. These electromagnetic fields,
      especially, emanate mainly from the sphere, whereas the
      electrostatic fields find substantially their seat in At oosphere.
      The terrestrial magnetism and of other manifestations are the
      proof of the ones and the electrostatic loads of the atmosphere
      appear with all at the time of the storms, which are only one
      local climax of their constant activity.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"> It is as known as the terrestrial
      sphere, like all the stars, bathes in a radiation field cosmic,
      invisible but not less actual.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">It is less known than the metabolism
      of the living beings in general, and of the man in particular, is
      disturbed when it is in a such field of a large intensity. The
      evil of the voyages is only one particular manifestation and one
      can secure oneself some by eliminating the static electricity
      created by rapid displacement from the vehicle.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"> Gold, the simultaneous presence of
      these different vibrational fields of telluric and cosmic waves,
      whose frequencies are different, causes interferences creating of
      the alternate zones of bellies of intensity or the intensity is
      maximum and of the nodes where the intensity is minimum, which
      creates with the level of the ground a true squaring which causes
      zones of large harmfulness and zones of calms, which is all the
      more responsive as one remains a long time in one of these zones.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"> Thus certain buildings or certain
      places are regarded as malefic, certain same like particularly
      malefic, whereas the other ones allow true and healthy
      recuperation of energy.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"> The purpose of the device, object of
      the invention, are thus creating induced currents by these waves
      themselves to interfere also with them and to thus modify the
      configuration created by the natural interferences, sup thus
      preceding the harmfulness of certain places.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"> For that, the device is consisted
      capable oscillating electrical circuits, by c#onduction, to emit
      electromagnetic waves different lengths of wave, so that some of
      them are different frequency of the telluric and cosmic waves of
      the place and this fact capable to interfere with them thus
      modifying the network of interferences natural and harmful in this
      point. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"> The annexed drawings, given as
      example only, show an embodiment of the device object of the
      present invention.</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Figure



        3</span> is a schematic sight of a device combining these two
      preceding and is still appropriate for a larger surface.<br>
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: center;"><img
        src="fr2554354b.jpg" alt=""></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Figure



        4</span> is a schematic sight of a device exerting its influence
      only on one low surface, into inner for example.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"> Such as it is represented the device,
      object of the invention, comprises metallic rings of different
      diameters forming of the oscillating circuits generating of the
      induced vibrational currents which present different lengths of
      wave of which one at least is capable to interfere with the
      telluric and cosmic waves of the place and to thus modify the
      natural network of interferences in this point, removing noted
      harmfulness to him.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"> The metallic rings thus used are out
      of copper preferably in consequence of the large conductivity of
      this metal.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"> According to an embodiment
      represented by figure 1 the copper 1 rings, 2, 3, 4 and 5, at
      least for example, are organized centered on a same line, in a
      substantially homothetic way, regularly spaced between them and
      welded onto a straight bar 6 of the same metal exceeding series of
      rings on both sides and passing by the center of each one of them
      parallel to their planar.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"> Thus the five rings aligned on the
      straight bar 6 and following one another since smallest according
      to an arithmetical progression of their diameter, whose difference
      between the diameter of each one is equal with the diameter of the
      smallest ring, considered as base, and each one of these rings
      being far away from the neighbouring circles from a substantially
      equal distance to the diameter from the basic ring, and the bar
      connecting the centers exceeding as has each end of the
      continuation of the rings of a substantially equal value to the
      diameter of the basic circle, one notes as protection in this case
      is effective on a surface whose surface is approximately given by
      the expression <br>
      Sm2 = 108D4 in which D is the diameter of the largest ring thus
      obtained.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"> For example, if one gives to these
      five rings the diameters éta gear.t from 20 to 100 mm in the
      proportion of diameters 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, one notes that the year
      protects a surface from 10.000 m2 located at north of the
      apparatus, (this one being always directed towards the north one),
      i.e. a surface developing on approximately 100 m in front of the
      apparatus and 50 m on both sides of the locus of centres.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"> According to another embodiment
      represented by figure the 2 copper 7 rings, 8, 9, 10 for example
      are organized in a concentric way joined together between them by
      the straight bar it passing by the center and exceeding on both
      sides largest ring, parallel to their planar<br>
      Thus four concentric copper rings, integral of the parallel bar It
      with each one of them and passing by their center, and following
      one another since smallest according to a progression arithméti'
      that of their diamè- tre whose difference between the diameters of
      each one is equal with the diameter of the smallest ring
      considered as base, one notes that protection in this case and
      according to this provision is given by the expression<br>
      Sm2 = 4 X 106D4 in which D is the diameter of the largest ring
      thus obtained.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"> For example, if one gives to these
      four rings diameters staging of 50 A 200 mm, in the proportions of
      diameters I, 2, 3, 4, one notes that one protects a surface from
      6.400 m2 located at north of the apparatus (bar 11 being always
      directed towards the north one), i.e. a surface developing on
      approximately 80 m in front of the apparatus and 40 m on both
      sides of bar 11.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"> According to another embodiment
      represents by figure the 4 copper 12 rings and 13 for example are
      organized in a way concentric also, but with the number of two
      only, and also joined together by a bar 14 passer by by their
      center and exceeding on both sides largest.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"> The difference in their diameter is
      equal to the 1/5 of - diameter of the smallest ring considered as
      base and the bar 14 passer by by the center exceeds on the one
      hand of a substantially equal value to the diameter of the
      smallest ring and on the other hand of an equal value to the
      difference between the diameters of two rings.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"> In this case, one notes that with two
      concentric copper rings of 50 and 60 mm, for example, protection
      obtained cover a surface of 13 m2 approximately answering in this
      case the expression:<br>
      Sm2 = 106 D4 in which D is the diameter of the largest ring.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"> Protection will thus extend in this
      case on 3,6 m in front of the apparatus in the north direction
      always and 1,8 m on both sides from the bar <br>
      It is clearly understood that the invention is not limited to the
      examples who were given, any alternative, considered as
      equivalence, not being able to modify the range of it.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"> Thus one could combine the different
      forms described above while realizing, according to figure 3 for
      example, of the series of several concentric rings placed coast at
      coast on a same bar, which would cause to increase protected
      surface by one of the devices represented by one of figures 1 or
      2, whose device of figure 3 is the combination. In the same way,
      obviously, as all other dimensions, in absolute value, could be
      given with the apparatuses, which will make it possible to protect
      from proportionally different surfaces.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"> The device object of the invention
      can be used to secure perturbations physiological and psychic
      caused by the waves telluric and cosmic, certain provisions
      suitable better for the outer one of the local ones, which is the
      case of figures 1, 2 and 3, of other (. 4) suitable better for the
      outer one.<br>
