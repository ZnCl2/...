        Inventor:&nbsp; OEHME RAINER <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract </span>-- In a device
        for the treatment of living beings and plants with pyramidal
        energy, the energy is picked up on energy pick-up lines (12,
        13), which are arranged electrically separate along the four
        edges of the pyramid (6). Since the emission of energy is
        particularly strong along the pyramid edges, a particularly
        large amount of energy can be picked up by energy pick-up lines
        (12, 13) of this type. Such energy pick-up lines (12, 13) are
        considerably cheaper to produce. <br>
        <br>
        The invention refers to an apparatus to the treatment of
        organisms and plants by pyramid energy, is provided with which
        outside at the pyramid at least an energy pick-up, from which an
        electrical lead to an Chakra electrode leads. Such an apparatus
        is subject matter of the DE-OS 35 30 841.<br>
        <br>
        With the known apparatus the made energy pick-up at the outer
        surface of a cup acting as swinging pot, which is from the top
        fitted on the pyramid. The fact that are present by means of the
        known apparatus between the Chakraelektroden energies, could
        become by measurement of the radioactivity of a water sample
        detected, as a same sample became outside of the apparatus
        disposed and the radioactivity over the time measured. With the
        sample between the Chakra electrodes shown itself contrary to
        the other sample within short time a rapid decay of the
        radioactivity. Of it the before-known apparatus is foreseen to
        the therapy of the humans used and has to amazing sound
        sequences guided.<br>
        <br>
        Adverse with known apparatus is it that this is expensive
        relative by the put on cup, which must consist of an expensive
        brass alloy or other, partly still more expensive materials in
        the fabrication, so that she could not find the spread, which
        would be appropriate due to their good therapeutic effect from
        cost reasons yet.<br>
        <br>
        The invention is the basis the object to arrange an apparatus
        that in such a manner initially mentioned type that the pyramid
        energy with if possible small effort at the pyramid tapped can
        become and the one if possible high efficiency exhibits.<br>
        <br>
        This object becomes according to invention dissolved by the fact
        that the energy pick-up is to along an edge of the pyramid
        longitudinal and separate power consumption line provided
        galvanic of the pyramid.<br>
        <br>
        Since the energy radiation at the pyramid edges is particularly
        strong, much energy can particularly become received by such
        power consumption lines. The power consumption lines, which
        cannot be by simple in the slight distance of the pyramid edges
        longitudinal, insulated copper wires formed, are substantial
        more inexpensive producible as the known cups put on acting as
        swinging pot on the pyramid. Therefore a pyramid energy
        installation is more inexpensive producible after the invention
        significant as the known apparatus.<br>
        <br>
        A therapeutic favourably acting apparatus according to the
        invention is characterised by the fact that at the two ends of
        the power consumption line an energy pick-up provided is and the
        upper energy pick-up with an upper Chakra electrode and the
        lower energy pick-up with a lower Chakra electrode connected is.<br>
        <br>
        Whole one is particularly favourably it, if along each edge of
        the pyramid is a power consumption line with two energy pick-ups
        provided and the upper energy pick-ups with four single
        electrodes of the upper Chakra electrode and the lower energy
        pick-ups with four single electrodes of the lower Chakra
        electrode are connected. By this design calculated can become
        with still better therapeu tables effects, since become radiated
        at the single edges different energies, which become guided
        without interference the single electrodes. For this in the
        contrast an interference of the energies received of the cup is
        to be expected with as swinging pot acting cup.<br>
        <br>
        Since the energies become rectangular the pyramid edge radiated,
        it is favourable, if the energy pick-ups are in height of the
        pyramid point and the pyramid basis provided at the end of a
        rectangular bending of the power consumption line in each case.<br>
        <br>
        The passed on energy receives a corresponding twist to the
        Chakrazentren, if the bending are clockwise rotatingly coiled
        after type of a Korkenziehers. To the promotion of this effect
        one can train the outlet lines as right-coiled conductors or
        lead the outlet lines as whole clockwise rotatingly wound to the
        Chakra electrodes.<br>
        <br>
        The Engerieaufnahmeleitungen can become on very much simple
        manner in a fixed distance the respective pyramid edge held, if
        in accordance with another embodiment of the invention the power
        consumption lines in each case are with a portion of their two
        by the bending formed angle in in each case a slot of an
        insulator at the pyramid point and the pyramid basis held.<br>
        <br>
        Here it is favourable, if the insulators planned at the base of
        the pyramid at each edge in each case seize that with a
        rectangular recess over a corner of the pyramid and in their
        surface the power consumption line female slot have.<br>
        <br>
        The energy radiated of the pyramid point can become in a simple
        manner likewise caught and thus used, if in the insulator
        planned on the tip of the pyramid a galvanic, coaxial to the
        pyramid axle aligned and after type of a Korkenziehers clockwise
        rotatingly coiled power consumption electrode separate of the
        pyramid is provided.<br>
        <br>
        Particularly simple is the upper insulator designed, if it is a
        cylinder with a coaxial bore to the receptacle of the power
        consumption electrode and with four radial slots for the power
        consumption lines and if those is the pyramid point directed
        front surface of the insulator the corresponding pyramid
        inclination as interior cone formed.<br>
        <br>
        Case the energy at the tip of the pyramid with received becomes,
        then the effect of the pyramid energy installation is
        particularly large, if in accordance with another embodiment of
        the invention the upper Chakra electrode additional has a middle
        single electrode, which is connected with the power consumption
        electrode of the pyramid point to the four single electrodes
        connected with the upper energy pick-ups and the corresponding
        pyramid-high is enough deeper downward as the remaining single
        electrodes. Apart from the simpler energy pick-up the apparatus
        according to invention is more inexpensive producible compared
        with the known apparatuses also, because the upper Chakra
        electrode only five and the lower Chakra electrode only four
        single electrodes required.<br>
        <br>
        For the therapeutic treatment of the humans it is favourable, if
        all single electrodes of the two Chakraelektroden with those
        energy pick-ups are connected, which with the single electrodes
        aligning, if one the pyramid with their tip wei send yourself
        downward between the Chakraelektroden thinks.<br>
        <br>
        The invention permits numerous embodiments. To the other clarity
        of its basic principle one of it is in the drawing shown and
        becomes subsequent described. The drawing shows in<br>

        <div style="text-align: left;">In fig 1 the illustrated
          apparatus has a base plate 1 with impellers 2, 3. On this base
          plate 1 is 5 disposed around a vertical axis 4 a rotatable
          edition, on which a pyramid 6 out for example coppers stands.
          Before the edition 5 a stand 7 on the base plate is 1
          attached, which an upper Chakra electrode 8 and a lower Chakra
          electrode 9 stop ore. The pyramid energy becomes the two
          Chakra electrodes 8, 9 supplied over lines 10, 11. Important
          one for the invention is the type of the power consumption of
          the pyramid 6. This results most clearly from the figs 2 and
          3.<br>
        </div>
        <br>
        The fig 2 shows that parallel runs in each case to the edges of
        the pyramid 6 a power consumption line 12, 13, which are at the
        pyramid point of an upper, all four power consumption lines 12,
        13 common insulator 14 and at the corners of the base of the
        pyramid 6 in each case by a lower insulator 15, 16 held. Each
        power consumption line 12, 13 does not consist of one the
        parallel pyramid edge longitudinal, insulated wire section 17
        and a rectangular bending 18, 19, those corkscrew-like,
        clockwise rotatingly coiled is and at its end in each case a
        plug-in connection 20, 21 has.<br>
        <br>
        The upper insulator 14 of the pyramid 6 carries coaxial to the
        pyramid 6 a power consumption electrode 38, which is from a
        clockwise rotatingly coiled, corkscrew-like and formed in main
        extending direction pointing piece of wire upward, at whose end
        as energy pick-up likewise a plug-in connection 39 provided is.<br>
        <br>
        The fig 3 shows that additional to the insulators 15, 16 is also
        at the two other corners of the pyramid 6 corresponding
        insulators 22, 23 provided. These insulators 15, 16, 22, 23 have
        a slot, for example a slot 24 in the insulator 15, in their top
        in each case into which a power consumption line, to the example
        the power consumption line 17, sits in each case with a portion
        of the angle formed by bending 18. Corresponding slots 25 - 28
        is in radial alignment in the outer surface of the upper
        insulator 14 provided, into those the upper in each case angle
        of each power consumption line 12, 13 sits.<br>
        <br>
        The figs 4 and 5 show the fact that the upper Chakra electrode 8
        from altogether five single electrodes 29 - exists 33, whereby
        the middle single electrode 33 is enough more other downward
        around the height of the pyramid 6 as the remaining single
        electrodes 29, 30, 31, 32.<br>
        <br>
        In the figs the lower Chakra electrode 9 shown consists 6 and 7
        of four single electrodes 34 - 37, which with the single
        electrodes 29 - 32 aligning.<br>
        <br>
        The fig 8 clarifies, as the single electrodes 29 - 37 with the
        energy pick-ups of the pyramid 6 connected is. The upper in each
        case energy pick-ups along the pyramid edges led power
        consumption lines 12, 13 and the energy pick-up of the power
        consumption electrode 38 on the tip of the pyramid 6 are with
        the upper Chakra electrode 8 and the remaining energy pick-ups,
        thus the four at the underside of the power consumption lines of
        12, 13 intended energy pick-ups, are with the lower Chakra
        electrode 9 connected. If one imagines the pyramid 6 with the
        tip downward pointing between the Chakra electrodes 8, 9, then
        all connecting leads without itself lead to over-cross to the
        respective single electrodes 29 - 37.<br>
        <br>
        The figs 9 and 10 clarify the design of the upper insulator 14.
        One recognizes that coaxial by it through a bore leads 40, who
        flows at the underside into an interior cone 41, which is so
        dimensioned that the insulator 14 good can be set on the tip of
        the pyramid 6. The fig 9 shows further the two slots 25, 27 and
        fig 10 all four radial slots 25 - 28.<br>
        <br>
        The figs 11 and 12 show at the example of the lower insulator 15
        that the lower insulators 15, 16, 22, 23 42 exhibit an angular
        recess in each case, with which it around a corner of the
        pyramid 6 to seize are able. Further the figs 11 and 12 show the
        slot 24, used into which the power consumption line becomes 12
        with a corner.<br>
