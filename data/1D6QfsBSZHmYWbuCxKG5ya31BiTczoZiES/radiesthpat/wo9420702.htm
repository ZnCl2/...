      <span style="font-weight: bold;"> Abstract -- </span><strong></strong><span
        style="float: right;" class="btnY"></span>In a device for
      conveying damp or salts, e.g., to dry masonry, with at least one
      electrical conductor wound into a coil (100) and fitted in a
      housing, the winding diameter of the coil (100) diminishes
      spirally from one end to the other. Here the distance between the
      windings of a spiral or wedge-spiral coil (100) and the coil axis
      in the inward direction is 40 to 60 % smaller on each full
      revolution than the previous distance. On average, therefore, this
      gives: for the spiral radius measured at 90 DEG : R'1 = R1-R2/4;
      at 180 DEG : R''1 = R1-R2/2; at 270 DEG : R'''1 = R1-R2x3/4; at
      360 DEG : R2 = R1/2.<br>
      <p style="font-weight: bold;"> Appliance to the transportation of
        humidity or salts<br>
      </p>
      <p>The invention refers to an appliance to the transportation of
        humidity or salts, e.g. to the Enffeuchtung of masonry, with at
        least, in an housing disposed electric conductor wound to a
        coil, whereby the turn diameter of the coil becomes spiral-like
        from end to end smaller.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> There is appliances of this type known, those without direct
        contact to the cloths, who are to be enffeuchtet or and without
        direct terminal to a power source and/or enffeuchtende effect
        exercise. The effect of these appliances lies in the fact that
        by certain electromagnetic fields of certain frequency within
        the high frequency microwave range in porous, capillary-like
        material systems, z. B.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Building materials or soil, which become adhesive forces
        between moist molecules and material molecules disturbed. This
        leads to a decrease of the moist mirror.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Appliances, those in the lower Hochfmquenzbereich, e.g. during
        external excitation by corresponding present short waves in the
        high-frequency resonant frequencies exhibit, can cause the
        accurate contrary, by them e.g. cause by the diode effect of the
        wall an increase of the wall potential and thus a rising of the
        wall-moist cause. Most of these appliances are in three
        resonance spectra more or less resonancable, i.e. the mechanical
        spectrum, which electromagnetic spectrum and drillen, only
        relative new discovered spectrum, i.e. the gravomagnetischen
        spectrum.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> A gravomagnetische wave consists, so far more detectable, of a
        linear, elliptical or circular polarized magnetic wave component
        and a polarized rotary gravitatorischen wave component circular
        around the magnetic wave.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>On a whole undulation of the magnetic component usually several
        undulations of the gravitatorischen component enffallen.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> If the known appliances in the electromagnetic spectrum became
        offset by environmental radiation in resonance, then they had
        the mentioned above effects. In most cases these effects were
        however imperfect and/or. they were very often dependent of not
        foreseeable influences.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> The invention has it itself therefore to the object set, an
        appliance that initially mentioned type in such a manner to
        verbessem that it can always work independent of various outside
        influences in optimum manner. Achieved one becomes this by the
        fact that the distance of the turns of a spiral or tapered
        spiral coil of the coil axle is smaller inward too with each
        full revolution around 40% to 60% as the preceding distance.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> The requirements posed have themselves to fulfill as one of
        the known appliances with numerous experiments shown that
        according to invention equipped an appliance is far better
        suitable, with which the spiral wound coil exhibits constant
        turn distances, whereby besides between the ends of the coil a
        disturbance-susceptible condenser had to be switched on.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> With an embodiment according to invention a converter exhibits
        an housing, disposed in which a pane connected with a foreign
        energy source is in the distance of the end of the inner
        conductor of a coaxial part to the conversion of electromagnetic
        energy into gravomagnetische energy, which is connected with a
        spiral coil located outside of the housing.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> Other features of the invention result from the subsequent
        description in connection with the Unteransprüchen. In the
        designs embodiments are shown, is limited however not on which

      <p>Show: Fig. 1 in plan view a spiral coil according to invention;
        Fig. 2 in view a tapered spiral coil; Fig. 3 three offset spiral
        coils against each other uniform in plan view; Fig. 4 likewise
        in plan view two spiral coils with same axis however opposite
        Windungssinn; Fig. 5 in the left half a Ausfühmngsform of an
        appliance according to invention and in the right half an
        embodiment of the invention supplemented by an other spiral
        coil; Fig. 6 in the section after the line B-B in Fig. 7 an
        other embodiment of the invention and Fig.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>7 a section after the line A-A in Fig. 6.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> In Fig. 1 represented spiral coil 100 exhibits turns, whose
        mutual distance decreases from the outside inward to steady. As
        from the drawing apparent is, the instantaneous radius g 1 is
        with the turn beginning of A twice as large like the
        instantaneous radius R2 after a full revolution. General one is
        Rn+i=Rn/2. In the case of a steady reduction arises therefore:<br>
        The spiral radius R1' = g 1 - R2 14 at 1800 g 1 " = g 1 -,
        measured with 900, R2/2 with 270 G 1 " '= g 1 - R2 x 314 with
        360 " R2=R112. </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> Deviations to approximately 10% are possible.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> The tapered spiral coil after Fig. corresponds to 2 to the
        spiral coil after Fig. 1 with the difference that the turns a
        bottom pitch angle alpha, preferably between 20 and 30, upward
        runs.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> Into the Fig. 1 and 2 illustrated embodiments represents the
        simplest form of a gravomagnetischen polarization generator
        according to invention. This Coil things receive
        gravomagnetische Erdfelder with the frequency of the hydrogen
        from the floor, whereby an alignment is in north south direction
        required. Free cosmic energy is received from above and into
        gravomagnetische energy with the frequency of the hydrogen
        converted. The polarity of the delivered field is depending upon
        building of coils either left or right-handed polarized. The
        delivered intensity of the field is by far strong as the present
        intensity of the gravomagnetischen field of the earth. Thus the
        generated system a potential, e.g. in the masonry, whereby the
        water molecules downward (with dextropolarisation) or upward
        (with Linkspolariation) wandem.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> With in Fig. 3 represented multiple spiral coil is everyone of
        the Einzelspulen 101, 102 and 103 as in Fig. 1 formed. These
        three Einzelspulen are ever around 1200 offset, on a plate 104
        disposed and in the center favourably connected by means of a
        soldering connection. The entire unit is convenient formed as
        printed circuit.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> The function essentially corresponds to the function of the
        coils after the Fig. 1 or 2, is however no north south alignment
        required and the generated field is besides stronger.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> In accordance with Fig. 4 is two against-intimate wound
        multiple spiral coils 105 and 106 on one side each of the
        insulating board 104 disposed. The two multiple spiral coils 105
        and 106 are not with one another conductive connected. In the
        drawn Ausfühnrngsbeispiel the beginnings of the lower multiple
        spiral coil are 106 opposite the beginnings of the upper
        multiple spiral coil 105 around 60 offset.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> The unit existing as entire with 1 designated, from the plate
        104 and the two multiple spiral coils 105 and 106 is into an
        appliance according to invention in accordance with Fig. 5
        incorporated. This unit 1 represents the actual receiving
        section of the polarization generator. By means of a leader
        director/conductor of 3 the unit 1 with a multiple spiral coil
        is 2 corresponding Fig. 3 conductive connected. The two multiple
        spiral coils 1 and 2 are from each other held by means of an
        holder 4 in the distance. The holder 4 is by means of an
        adhesive 5 at the lower part 7 of the housing 6 fixed existing
        from aluminium. Fastening screws 8 complete in the left half of
        the Fig. 5 represented appliance.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> In the right half of the Fig. 5 is a variant shown, with the
        spiral coils 100 corresponding Fig. 1 on an insulating board 9
        disposed and over a conductor 10 with the multiple spiral coil 2
        connected are. There is so many single spiral coils 100 present,
        when single spiral coils are in the multiple spiral coil 2
        disposed. The plate 9 becomes held by an holder 11, who holds
        also the two multiple spiral coils 1 and 2 in their layer.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> With both execution variants in accordance with Fig. 5 it
        comes to one Function separation of the coils: the multiple
        spiral coil 1 represents a pure receiving section of the
        gravomagnetischen Wasserstoffeldes of the earth and the multiple
        spiral coil 2 is the polarizing unit, which delivers the energy
        in polarized state. Both multiple spiral coils form together the
        generator.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> Such a formed appliance is suitable for all occurring
        gravomagnetischen field polarities and can thus universeli at
        each location of the earth inserted become. By the returning
        coils 100 the field becomes directed more downward.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> With the embodiment after the figs 6 and 7 is above the
        multiple spiral coil 1 a solenoid 11 as Gwndspule disposed. The
        bottom two coils 1 and 11 a field stabilizer 16 is in form of a
        pane from coppers or aluminium.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> A blade antenna 17 formed as coaxial conductor is insulated
        into soil the inserted. Their inner conductor is 1 conductive
        connected by means of a lead 18 over a controllable resistance
        19 with the multiple spiral coil.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> Such blade antennas can be with high speed plants, in
        particular during the soil humidification, necessary. Smaller
        systems with a number of turns of approximately 24 do not need a
        such blade antenna.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> A plastic tube 20 lined with an aluminium foil 21 shields the
        lead before electromagnetic Feldem. It would be also the use of
        an aluminum or a copper tube possible.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> Three to each other around 1200 offset and opposite the
        solenoid 11 returning coils 12 inclined around the angle gamma
        are with one another in series connected. The solenoid 11
        however is 12 parallel connected to the returning coils
        connected in series.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> The terminal of the single leader directors/conductors of made
        over a coaxial shank with an inner conductor 15a and an outer
        conductor 15b. The two conductors 15a and 15b become 27 held in
        the distance from each other by two insulant disks. With the
        upper ends of the conductors 15a, 15b three pair parallel
        longitudinal, from each other insulated wires 13a and 13b
        connected, which are by the center of the returning coils 12,
        each 29 guided by one tube, are. The length of the wires 1 3a
        and 1 3b depends on the number of turns of the solenoid 11; the
        per large number of turns of the basic coil 11, the larger the
        length of the wires should be 1 3a and 1 3b. The axis of the
        wires 1 3a and 1 3b should essentially coincide with the axis of
        the returning coils 12. The parallel wires 13a and 13b are
        mechanical by a tube 29 from plastic or better electrical
        shielding material, e.g. Aluminium, central straight guided.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> Like in particular from Fig. 6 apparent is, is all leads to
        that Coaxial shank 15a, 15b twisted. The sense of direction of
        twisting depends on the sense of direction of the coil winding.
        Accordingly a right twisting is to become and with left-handed
        coils a Linksverdilung applied with right-handed coils. The
        Windungssinn of the solenoid 11 depends thereby on the purpose
        of the apparatus according to invention: Right-handed the coil
        for dehumidifying purposes should be left-handed and for
        moistening purposes wound.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> Into the Fig. 6 and 7 is besides an holding device 14 shown,
        which holds the solenoid 11 in their layer. An other holding
        device 15 is 16 disposed to the attachment of the spiral coil 1
        and the field stabilizer.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> It is more femer a controllable resistance 1 9a for instance
        in the area between 0,05 and 30kOhm provided, in order to reach
        a power adjustment. This resistance 1 9a is with a line end with
        the inner conductor 15a and the other line end with the outer
        conductor 15b connected. Also these terminals are, as in Fig. 6
        apparent, twisted.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> An housing from not conductive or electrical shielding
        material, e.g.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Aluminium sheet, with an upper part 22 and a lower part 23,
        which are both parts by screws 24 connected with one another,
        encloses the larger part of the apparatus. In Fig. 6 is besides
        a suspension device 25 and/or. stands are 26 indicated for a
        floor assembly.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> In accordance with Fig. 8 foreign energy supplied over an
        equal or an AC source 31 setting equipment 32, an oscillator 33,
        an amplifier 34 and a narrow-band band filter 35 the
        Frequenzstabilisation, a converter 36, which changes
        electromagnetic pulses into gravomagnetische pulses, becomes.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> The converter 36 is in Fig. 9 more near shown.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> In accordance with this fig the signal coming from the band
        filter 35 becomes supplied over the inner conductor 40 of a
        coaxial leader 41 of a pane 42 convenient from coppers. The pane
        42 out e.g. is in one about cylinder or quaderförmigen housings
        43. Aluminium or copper. In this housing 43 the actual
        transformation takes place, i.e. the electrical component of the
        electromagnetic wave becomes converted into the gravitatorische
        component. A gravomagnetische standing wave (half wave) forms,
        those over a convenient printed spiral coil 100 and/or. Coils
        101.102.103 radiated becomes. The transmission to the spiral
        coil 100 made over a coaxial part 44, whereby is 45 disposed
        between the housing 43 and the spiral coil 100 a copper or an
        aluminum disk. The inner conductor of the coaxial part of 44
        rises up thereby into the interior of the housing 43 and is with
        the respective coil 100.101.102.103 conductive connected, e.g.
        by a screw.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> By means of appliances according to invention it is e.g. also
        possible, a demineralization to accomplish by masonry.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> It has itself shown that during a dehumidifying the salts
        present in the masonry (nitrates, sulphates, chlorides,
        carbonates) in clean and/or. with Fresken also into the painting
        wandem. Around this to that, working with the same types of
        appliances for the Enffeuchtung, only with other frequencies,
        which become dissolved salt molecules downward by specific
        periodical fields carried, can. The sense of coil of the coil
        systems is thus reverse thereby anti-clockwise rotating, as with
        the Enffeuchtungsger ten. </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> Become with dehumidifying instantaneous radii g 1 (Fig. 1)
        from 10,5 cms or multiples of it an used, are with the
        demineralization devices the corresponding various four
        frequencies instantaneous radii of 20,5cm, 31,3cm, 15,6cm and
        23,4cm more applicable. Tolerances in the order of magnitude of
        approximately 15% are possible.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> With presences of salts in capillary-like material systems
        first the demineralization devices become established, which
        become after approximately 2 to 6 months withdrawn and against
        the dehumidifying devices interchanged. The corresponding
        indicated above instantaneous radii formed spiral coils can be
        in an housing disposed one above the other, so that an uniform
        appliance, which responds to all four frequencies, develops.</p>
