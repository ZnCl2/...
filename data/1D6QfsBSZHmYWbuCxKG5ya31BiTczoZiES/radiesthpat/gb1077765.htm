      Inventor: ROBERT ANFOSSO<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;"> Abstract</span> -- A device said
      to stimulate plants, or animal or mineral bodies, comprises one or
      more arcuate or bent member 3 of an electrically conductive
      material supported on an electrically insulating member 2 of
      ebonite or a synthetic plastics material. An animal or mineral
      body being treated may be positioned on an earthed plate. The
      effect is said to be improved if the member 3 is directed to the
      East.<br>
      <br>
      <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="gb1077765.jpg" alt=""></div>
      <br>
      The present invention relates to a device for affecting the growth
      or properties of organic or mineral bodies and more particularly
      for stimulating the growth of plants.<br>
      <br>
      From one aspect, the invention consists in a device for affecting
      the growth or properties of an organic or mineral body comprising
      a support of electrically insulating material carrying at least
      one arcuate or open hoop-like member of electrically conducting
      material having a substantial gap between the ends of said member
      and being intended to extend around a body or bodies when in use.<br>
      <br>
      The invention also consists in a device for stimulating the growth
      of plants comprising a support of electrically insulating material
      and at least one arcuate or open hoop-like member of electrically
      conducting material carried by the support and extending in a
      plane substantially normal to said support, said at least one
      member having a substantial gap between the ends of said member,
      and being intended to extend around a plant or plants when in use.<br>
      <br>
      The device may comprise a plurality of said members arranged one
      above the other on the support. Preferably the gap between the
      ends of the or each member is of a width equal to at least one
      quarter of the length of the member.<br>
      <br>
      Means may be provided for earthing an organic body surrounded by
      the arcuate or open hoop-like member or members, if the body is
      not already connected to earth.<br>
      <br>
      The effects obtained by means of the device according to the
      invention, can be applied to bodies of three types: animal,
      vegetable and mineral, and can be shown to stimulate the physical,
      chemical, biochemical or other types of properties of the bodies
      under consideration.<br>
      <br>
      Numerous experiments have shown, for example, a more rapid growth
      of the plants, a therapeutic action on animals and man, and a
      temporary or permanent modification of the properties and/or
      relationships of certain mineral bodies submitted to the effects
      of the apparatus according to the invention.<br>
      <br>
      The invention will now be further described, by way of example,
      with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figures 1 to
      4 all show perspective views of embodiments of devices according
      to the invention.<br>
      <br>
      Referring to Figure 1, there is shown an embodiment of the device
      applied to stimulate the growth of a plant. A vertical support 2
      comprising a rod made of any type of electrically non-conducting
      material, such as ebonite, Bakelite (Trade Mark) or other plastics
      material is driven into the ground 1. This support carries a
      horizontally disposed arcuate member 3 made of metal, for example
      of copper. The plant 4, surrounded by and submitted to the field
      of the arcuate member, has its properties and its growth
      stimulated.<br>
      <br>
      The arrow A, corresponding to the direction of the gap or opening
      between the ends of the arcuate member, indicates the direction of
      the East, or another direction previously determined as preferred;
      for example as a result of previous experiments on sample plants.
      <br>
      <br>
      As shown in Figure 2, the device may comprise a group of several
      parallel arcuate members 3 arranged one above the other on the
      support 2.<br>
      <br>
      If it is a question of the treatment of a body, which, contrary to
      the plants of the above examples, is not itself connected to the
      earth; the body can be connected to earth by employing, for
      example, the arrangement of Figure 3, where the support 2 is
      mounted on an insulating plate 5. The body to be treated 6, which
      may be animal or mineral, is disposed within the arms of the
      arcuate member 3 on a conducting metal plate 7, connected to earth
      1 by means of the conducting wire 8.<br>
      <br>
      Figure 4 shows an embodiment wherein the member 3 has a different
      shape and forms an open hook-like member.<br>
      <br>
      In all of the above described embodiments, it will be seen from
      the drawings that the gap between the open ends of the member or
      members 3 is of a width equal to at least about one quarter of the
      length of the member.<br>
