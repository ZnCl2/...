        <br>
        Present invention relates to a method and an apparatus intended
        to protect the living organisms against the adverse
        physiological effects of the electrostatic and electromagnetic
        fields, as well those of natural origin as those which are
        created by industrial sources of any nature, this method and
        this apparatus being based on observations completely new being
        able to be connected to hypothetical theoretical considerations
        completely new to date.<br>
        <br>
        The human beings, as well as the animals living in the modern
        world, evolve/move in fact in a medium very highly disturbed by
        the accumulating of the electromagnetic and electrostatic fields
        which the many sources create which surround them, and it is
        quite known that the physiological state of any organism is
        constantly assigned by these fields.<br>
        <br>
        Thus, the fields electromagnetic emanating from the motor and
        which reigns H the inner one of an automobile to the origin of
        physiological and psychophysiologic faintnesses is generated by
        the automobile on the passengers (tiredness, migraines, nauseas,
        pains bodily). Beside the drugs tranquillizing, acting on the
        effect and not on the cause, one proposed like remedy for these
        disorders only the conductive material tape of the electricity,
        playing the role of taken earth for the vehicle.<br>
        <br>
        In the same way, it is quite known that the extended observing
        of television screens or computers is accompanied also by the
        same phenomena. It is also the case of the subjects
        evolving/moving in the local ones equipped with installations
        with medical treatment, or electronic or electromechanical
        equipment utilizing sources inevitably creating raised fields,
        with the immediate vicinity of which the operators evolve/move.<br>
        <br>
        The invention rests on the exposed one that certain materials,
        assembled or joined together following certain patterns, and
        having undergone certain treatments, can be regarded as poles
        which, joined together by two, three or more, give birth, by a
        phenomenon of tuning, with “waves of form”, constituting a way
        of directional screen playing a protective role against the
        aforementioned effects.<br>
        <br>
        These materials must in accordance with the invention be
        subdivided in plusieures categories, according to their nature
        and of their layout.<br>
        <br>
        A first assembly is that of webs or conductive material boards,
        juxtaposed without contact in a following same plane an open
        angular pattern.<br>
        <br>
        These webs or boards must themselves be subdivided in two
        separate classes<br>
        - the first class is consisted magnetizable material webs, such
        as for example the family metals of the iron (Iron, Nickel,
        cobalt) and their oxides (ferrites) and like.<br>
        <br>
        - the second class is consisted material webs nonmagnetizable
        but endowed with raised coefficients of conductivity, such as
        for example brass, copper, the silver, the gold and like.<br>
        <br>
        In accordance with the invention, this first assembly joins
        together at least two respectively selected webs each one in one
        of the aforesaid classes, these webs having approximately the
        same dimensions and being laid out on a same plane, each one
        being spaced the neighbouring one of a distance of about 2 to
        30% its length, so that the unit, it be-E-statement the
        aforementioned assembly, represents an open angular pattern, for
        example Z, K, NR, F, by opposition E of the closed patterns such
        as O, D, or crossed such as X, which are not appropriate E this
        effect.<br>
        <br>
        A second assembly is that consisted ferrite particles
        distributed within a micronized powder inert, at a rate of 2 to
        30 Z of ferrite and perfectly dehydrated of manner E to
        constitute a perfectly dry mass, agglomerated by means of an
        also inert binder, for example of Arabic gum or polyvinyl
        alcohol.<br>
        <br>
        The assembly of the webs, in accordance with the invention, is
        placed on the bottom plane of an housing which is then filled of
        the inert powder and ferrite powder mixture, that one then on
        the spot agglomerates by means of said binding, housings being
        then sealed by means of a sealed cover.<br>
        <br>
        In accordance with the invention, the systems consisted these
        housings thus packed of the assemblies of webs and the powder
        mixture agglomerated must, to express their properties, to
        undergo a treatment which one can compare to an activation and
        which consists in making them cross a series of magnetic fields
        to alternate orientation. Implementation the most single
        consists in using two successive magnetic fields of opposite
        orientation. One can however use an arbitrary number of such
        couples, for example to eight successive fields. For this
        purpose the packed housings can be placed on a conveying band
        moving with variable speed through fields successive created by
        excited electromagnets has variable intensities according to the
        application considered, but always smell some alternately
        opposite.<br>
        <br>
        Rolls actual of this activation is not known, nor same
        explicable starting from the conventional scientific
        considerations; it is possible that a phenomenon of orientation
        of the magnetized ferrite particles intervenes. One can only
        note the fact that the systems thus created in accordance with
        the invention have properties completely surprising and whose
        applications are many and substantial, when at least two systems
        thus defined are laid out face to face.<br>
        <br>
        Thus, of very many experiments showed that two produced
        apparatuses of this manner define a plane behind which a subject
        does not feel any more faintnesses caused usually by an
        electromagnetic field, created for example by the motor of an
        automobile or the radiation of the screen of a television set or
        a minicomputer.<br>
        <br>
        It should be admitted that no rational explanation can be
        currently supplied for this purpose. Various theoretical
        assumptions can be advancing, by analogy with known phenomena.<br>
        <br>
        Thus, by analogy with fields tension of fields magnetic created
        by bar magnet, and which is put visually in evidence only by
        means of iron filings, in a known experiment strong, whereas
        they exert their effects, on all the surrounding metal objects,
        one can imagine that the ferrite and brass webs create around
        them, in a certain provision, like “fields tension” to the waves
        of form, already recognized for certain inert materials, these
        tension fields component with those of electromagnetic fields in
        the neutralizing one, the “absorbent one” or deviating them.<br>
        <br>
        This assumption is not absurd, because with which could be
        raised and according to which inert elements could develop
        energy only if they receive previously an at least equivalent
        energy but of another nature, one can answer that the elements
        of an electrical stack are also inert and are nevertheless
        spontaneously générateu of energy when such stack is inserted in
        a circuit.<br>
        <br>
        Moreover one can admit that the treatment of the systems in
        accordance with the invention by the alternate magnetic fields
        owes accompa- gner of the transmission of a certain energy with
        the system.<br>
        <br>
        According to another assumption, one can also imagine that this
        fields of “tension fields” constitutes a like system has an
        optical system focalisator, i.e. with the outlet of which
        electromagnetic radiations, instead of radiating in all space
        surrounding, convergent towards a like area with hearths,
        outside which this radiation is not propagated any more.<br>
        <br>
        Of course, the invention is not in any limited extent by these
        hypothetical explanations, since it is based on the surprising
        observation of an unknown phenomenon, and ltexploitation of this
        phenomenon. The number and the nature of the experiments
        practised to control the reality of this phenomenon and these
        effects make it possible to eliminate the possibility of a
        psychological placebo, more especially as the aforementioned
        experiments also related to domestic animals, which are
        insensitive with the psychic factors. <br>
