      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract</span> -- A closed
      receptacle (1, 4) made of a non metallic material includes at
      least one interactive module, each interactive module comprising
      two parts, a first of said parts consisting of a permanent magnet
      (2) and the second part consisting of a bar (3) made of carbon,
      natural or artificial graphite or magnesium, said two parts being
      spaced apart such that said bar (3) is located in the magnetic
      flux produced by said magnet (2). The receptacle has fixing or
      suspension means for the fixation or suspension of the device onto
      a surface of or inside a machine or for allowing the device to be
      hung from a necklace.<br>
      <br>
      This invention concerns a device to counterbalance the surrounding
      electromagnetic radiation and in particular the radiation emitted
      by electric and electronic machines or apparatus with a view to
      preventing the users of such machines or apparatus or preventing
      persons standing in the vicinity of such machines from being
      subject to physiological disorders.<br>
      <br>
      Electric and electronic machinery in general are known to emit
      electromagnetic radiation of various wavelengths. Howevers, in the
      last few years the realization has gradually dawned that the
      habitual users of certain electronic machines and apparatus
      including the appliances and electronic devices that are becoming
      more and more common in offices or daily home life, are subject to
      physiological disorders. This is the case of the users of office
      CRT screen monitors and television receivers. The statistics
      collected in a number of countries have revealed in particular
      that the regular operators of such electronic machines suffer
      systematically from such complaints as troubles with vision,
      dizziness, muscle aches and stiffness, headache, and irritability.<br>
      <br>
      Although the exact causes of these complaints are still not
      completely understood and explained, various specialists who have
      observed and analyzed these phenomena attribute them chiefly to
      the electromagnetic radiation emitted by the machines.<br>
      <br>
      The applicant has studied this problem and, based on the idea that
      living cells grow and develop naturally when they are in a
      balanced electromagnetic field, believes that the foregoing
      complaints and disorders result from an imbalance in the
      surrounding electromagnetic waves due to an excess of harmful
      waves and more particularly those harmful waves generated by
      electronic machines.<br>
      <br>
      The object of this invention is a device to counterbalance the
      harmful radiation generated locally by a machine. This goal is
      achieved according to this invention by a device comprising a
      receptacle made of a non metallic material and at least one
      interactive module placed in the receptacle, each interactive
      module comprising two parts, a first part consisting of a
      permanent magnet and the second part consisting of a bar made of
      carbon, natural or artificial graphite or magnesium, said two
      parts being spaced apart such that said bar is traversed by
      magnetic flux lines produced by said magnet. The receptacle has
      fixing or suspension means for the fixation or suspension of the
      device onto a surface of or inside a machine or for allowing the
      device to be hung from a necklace.<br>
      <br>
      The invention is described below with the help of the accompanying
      drawings in which :<br>

      <br>
      Referring to Figs. 1 and 2 there is depicted an exemplary
      embodiment of the device of the invention. Fig. 1 shows the device
      with cover removed. In a non metallic receptacle 1, for example a
      polystyrene box having a diameter of about 60 mm, there is placed
      an interactive module comprised of two spaced apart parts : a
      permanent magnet 2 and a bar 3 made of carbon or natural or
      artificial graphite. These parts have for example a length of 20
      mm and are adapted in recesses provided in the bottom of the box
      1. As shown in Fig. 2 the cover 4 fits sealingly the upper edge of
      the box. The two parts 2 and 3 are spaced apart such that the
      carbon or graphite bar 3 is located in the magnetic flux produced
      by the magnet. A plurality of similar interactive modules can be
      housed in a same receptacle as well.<br>
      <br>
      As an example, the permanent magnet 2 is made of a compound sold
      on the market under the name of Alcomax III with the following
      composition by weight : 8.1 % aluminium, 13.5 % nickel, 24 %
      cobalt, 2.5 % copper, 0.5 % niobium and 51.4 % iron. The
      magnetisation of magnet is adapted to the appliance and can be
      chosen in the range of 500 to 3300 Gauss or so. The bar 3 consists
      for instance of Ellor 9 graphite, a fine-grained isotropic pure
      graphite yielding a maximum of 0.1 % ash on combustion and with a
      density of 1.80 g/cm3 and a resistivity of 1500 mu OMEGA cm. These
      parts can be embedded in a resin compound.<br>
      <br>
      The device according to the invention has fixing means, e.g. a
      self adhesive means 5 at the bottom of the receptacle, for
      allowing the device to be placed on or inside a machine or
      apparatus emitting electromagnetic radiation. A number of such
      devices, preferably at least three units, will be placed on the
      machine or appliance. Examples of such sources of harmful
      radiation include devices with cathode-ray screens (television
      sets, the monitors of word-processing machines, personal computer
      displays), and motor vehicles. Figure 3 shows a simple diagram of
      a cathode-ray screen. On such a screen, three devices 1 are placed
      at the points of a triangle, as follows : one on top of the
      screen, the other two near the bottom of the screen.<br>
      <br>
      During testing the applicant noticed that, thanks to the device
      according to this invention, the operators of electronic machines
      with cathode-ray screens could use the machines regularly and
      intensively without the recurrence of the complaints and disorders
      that usually follow after working on such machines.<br>
      <br>
      Without giving a scientific explanation of the phenomenon that he
      has observed, the applicant hypothesizes that the devices as
      described in the foregoing and arranged according to this
      invention, the carbon or graphite is activated by the magnet field
      and acts as a sink for the exceeding radiation thereby to modify
      the surrounding electromagnetic field in which the operators of
      electronic machines are placed and thereby to counterbalance the
      harmful radiation such that the surrounding radiation do not
      subject these operators to physiological disorders.<br>
      <br>
      The use of the device according to this invention is not limited
      to machines with cathode-ray screens, but includes all household
      appliances (microwave ovens, for example), computers, motor
      vehicles, and so on. When the machine is relatively large, it is
      preferable to use more than three units distributed over its
      entire surface.<br>
      <br>
      A variation to the device of the invention is depicted in Fig. 4.
      This embodiment is for being used by a person for protecting said
      person from the surrounding electromagnetic radiation. In the
      example shown, the device contains preferably three interactive
      modules, each comprising two parts : a permanent magnet 2 and a
      bar 3 made of magnesium these two parts being spaced apart such
      that the magnesium bar 3 is located in the magnetic flux generated
      by the magnet 2. The device of Fig. 4 has suspension means 6 for
      allowing the receptacle to be hung from a necklace. When so
      activated by the magnet flux, the magnesium bar 3 serves the same
      function as the carbon bar in the embodiment of Fig. 1, i.e. to
      counterbalance the electromagnetic radiation in excess, and in
      addition it acts as an activator for the physiological equilibrium
      of the person who is wearing the device as described.<br>
      <br>
      Although there has been described hereinbefore two particular
      embodiments in accordance with the invention for the purpose of
      illustrating the manner in which the invention may be used to
      advantage, it will be appreciated that the invention is not
      limited thereto. Accordingly, any and all modifications,
      variations or equivalent arrangements which may occur to those
      skilled in the art should be considered to be within the scope of
      the invention as defined in the appended claims.<br>
