        <br>
        This invention relates to torsion fields, an in particular to a
        device for providing protection from torsion fields for users of
        electronic equipment.<br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;"> BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</span><br
          style="font-weight: bold;">
        <br>
        Torsion fields are generated by the classical spin, or by the
        spin angular momentum density (on a macroscopic level) of any
        object. The spinning of an object sets up polarization in two
        spatial cones, corresponding to a left torsion field and a right
        torsion field. At an atomic level, nuclear spin as well as full
        atomic movements may be the source of torsion fields. This means
        that all objects in nature, live or dead, generate their own
        torsion field.<br>
        <br>
        Unlike electromagnetic and gravitation fields that have central
        symmetry, torsion fields have axial symmetry. Torsion fields are
        also different from electromagnetic fields in that torsion
        fields having an opposite spin repel each other. Torsion fields
        may also propagate through physical media without interacting
        with the media. Thus, torsion fields may not be shielded by most
        materials. However, a propagating torsion field alters the spin
        state of the media it propagates through. <br>
        <br>
        Since all substances have their own stereochemistry which
        determines not only the location of atoms in molecules, but also
        determines their mutual spin orientation, then the superposition
        of the torsion fields generated by the atomic and nuclear spins
        of each molecule determines the intensity of the torsion field
        in the space surrounding each molecule. The superposition of all
        these torsion fields determines the intensity and spatial
        configuration of the characteristic torsion field for that
        substance. Thus, each physical object, whether living or
        non-living, possesses its own characteristic torsion field.<br>
        <br>
        Torsion fields may also be generated by other methods in
        addition to the classical spin of particles. A wide spectrum of
        geometric forms of substances and objects are a natural source
        of torsion fields. Objects with a certain surface geometry will
        simultaneously generate left and right torsion fields of a
        certain configuration depending on the geometry of the object.
        Examples include, pyramids, cones, tridents, cylinders, and flat
        triangles.<br>
        <br>
        Torsion fields are also generated by electromagnetic fields.
        Since charge polarization simultaneously results in a loss of
        equilibrium in charge and spin, an electrostatic field is also
        followed by a torsion field. Thus, sources of electromagnetic
        and electrostatic fields are always sources of torsion fields.<br>
        <br>
        As electromagnetic fields are accompanied by torsion fields,
        most electronic devices, such as computer monitors and
        televisions are sources of torsion fields. Thus, torsion fields
        are generated during the operation of a monitor or television.
        Once the monitor or television is turned off, disturbances
        disappear and spatially split particles and antiparticles of
        phytons return automatically to their stable symmetric state.
        However, even after being shut off, the static torsion field
        created by the luminescent screen of the television or monitor
        does not disappear for some time.<br>
        <br>
        The property of spin of the molecules in each object is subject
        to influence by external torsion fields. Thus, the structure of
        the torsion field of each physical object can be altered by the
        influence of an external torsion field. The influence of an
        external torsion field would result in a new configuration of
        the torsion field in the object. This new torsion field would be
        fixed as a metastable state and will remain intact even after
        the source of the external torsion field is removed.<br>
        <br>
        Published studies have shown that exposure to left torsion
        fields may have a negative effect on the human body, while right
        torsion fields may actually have a positive effect. The negative
        effects of left torsion fields may include a decline in the
        response of the immune system and a susceptibility to disease.<br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;"> SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</span><br
          style="font-weight: bold;">
        <br>
        The present invention relates to a device for generating a right
        torsion field. The device includes an outer body, a salt
        solution, and a ring. The ring generates a first right torsion
        field and is disposed so that a portion of the first right
        torsion field propagates through the salt solution.<br>
        <br>
        In one embodiment of the invention, the outer body has a first
        chamber and a second chamber. The salt solution is disposed the
        first chamber and the ring is in the second chamber. The first
        chamber and the second chamber are then positioned so that a
        portion of the right torsion field propagates through the salt
        solution. <br>
        <br>
        The salt solution may include a rare earth metal salt. The salt
        solution may also include several different rare earth metal
        salts. In one embodiment, the salt solution includes
        approximately 5% Cerium, 5% Lutetium, and 5% Erbium by
        composition.<br>
        <br>
        The ring may also have a first end and a second end forming a
        gap in the ring.<br>
        <br>
        The ring may further have ball members attached to each end. The
        ring and associated ball members may inherently produce a first
        right torsion field an a second right torsion field. In order to
        increase the strength of the torsion fields, the ring and
        associated ball members may be constructed out of a metallic
        material.<br>
        <br>
        In accordance with another aspect of this invention a device for
        generating a right torsion field may include an outer body, a
        salt solution, a first ring and a second ring. The salt
        solution, first ring and second ring are disposed in the outer
        body. The first and second rings are concentric and together
        generate a right static torsion field. The salt solution, first
        ring, and second rings are disposed such that the right torsion
        field generated by the rings propagates through the salt
        solution. In one embodiment, the outer body may have a first
        chamber and a second chamber where then salt solution is in the
        first chamber and the rings are in the second chamber.<br>
        <br>
        The first ring and the second ring may also each have a gap. In
        one embodiment, the gaps for each of the rings are positioned
        such that the gap in the first ring is 180 degrees from the gap
        in the second ring. The device may also include a third ring in
        the second chamber. The third ring may also have a gap. The gap
        in the third ring may be positioned 180 degrees from the gap in
        the second ring.<br>
        <br>
        In accordance with another aspect of this invention a method of
        significantly decreasing the presence of left torsion fields
        about an electronic device includes the steps of generating a
        right torsion field, propagating the right torsion field through
        a salt solution, and directing the right torsion field
        substantially perpendicular to a left torsion field generated by
        the electronic device.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;"> DETAILED DESCRIPTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      FIG. 1 depicts one potential embodiment of a device for generating
      a right torsion field to provide significant protection to a user
      from left torsion fields, especially those generated by electronic
      equipment. The device includes an outer body 10 having a first
      chamber 20 and a second chamber 30. In one embodiment the outer
      body 10 is in the shape of a disk and is constructed from an inert
      plastic mass that does not affect the functionality of the device.
      Of course the outer body may be cylindrical, rectangular, or any
      other shape, and may also be constructed from any other material
      that would not interfere with the generation of torsion fields by
      the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      The first chamber 20 includes a salt solution. The salt solution
      may include water plus any element that would provide a
      significant number of positive and negative ions in the solution.
      For example, the salt solution may be natural sea water. The salt
      solution may alternatively be comprised of water and ordinary
      table salt. The water in the solution may also be substituted with
      another liquid as long as the liquid is capable of inherently
      generating a torsion field. The use of various elements, as well
      as various combinations of elements will result in varying torsion
      field strengths generated by the present device.<br>
      <br>
      Along with the choice of elements, the strength of the generated
      torsion field is also affected by the concentration of each
      element in the solution, the hydration of each element, and the
      temperature of the solution.<br>
      <br>
      In one embodiment, the salt solution includes a rare earth metal
      salt. The rare earth metal salt may be any element with an atomic
      numbers from 58 to 71 (inclusive) on the periodic chart. By using
      a salt solution including rare earth metals, the strength of the
      torsion field generated by the present invention is increased in
      comparison to any other type of salt solution. In one approach,
      the salt solution includes three different elements.<br>
      <br>
      The salt solution may be approximately 5% Cerium, 5% Lutetium, and
      5% Erbium by composition. However, any other rare earth metal salt
      may be used in addition to or in place of the these elements. The
      concentration of the element may also be varied.<br>
      <br>
      The salt solution generates left and right torsion due to the
      movement of opposite ions in opposite directions. The ions are set
      into motion by the magnetic fields generated by the magnetic poles
      of the earth. Hydroxyl ions and hydroxonium ions that are
      inherently present in the solution are set into motion as a result
      of the magnetic fields. The trajectories of movement of the
      hydroxyl and hydroxonium ions are cycloids.<br>
      <br>
      Since water molecules have a high dipole moment, the hydroxyl and
      hydroxonium ions that move from the point where they have appeared
      during dimer decomposition and rotate in the same area but in
      opposite directions will orient the nearest water molecules as if
      stringing them on the arch of a cycloid. This results in the
      unification of molecules situated on the hydroxile and hydroxone
      arches into flat circular associates due to collective aquatic
      links. Circular associates that appear are extremely passive
      because they are unpolar, neutral and slow moving due to their
      large size and weight. This makes the reconstruction of water into
      regulated ice-like structures easier. The ice-like structures
      generate the left and right torsion fields.<br>
      <br>
      The strength of the left and right torsion fields generated by the
      salt solution alone is related to the volume of solution present.
      However, the volume necessary to generate a torsion field with
      sufficient strength to repel a left torsion field from electronic
      equipment would be too large for convenient use.<br>
      <br>
      The first chamber 30 includes at least one ring. In one
      embodiment, the ring may be substantially cylindrical in
      cross-section. The ring may alternatively have a flat-crosssection
      or any other shape. The cross-sectional diameter of the rings may
      also be varied.<br>
      <br>
      The rings are preferably metallic, such as zinc or copper but may
      also be constructed out of any other material that inherently
      produces a torsion field. The shape and material of the ring will
      affect the strength of the torsion field generated by the ring. <br>
      <br>
      In one embodiment shown in FIG. 2, the first chamber 30 includes
      an inner ring 31, a central ring 32, and an outer ring 33. The
      three rings 31,32, and 33 are positioned concentric to one another
      on the horizontal plane. In one approach, each of the three rings
      is discontinuous, forming gaps in each ring. Thus, the inner ring
      31 has a first gap 34, the central ring 32 has a second gap 35,
      and the outer ring 33 has a third gap 36. The rings may be
      oriented such that the gap for each rings is positioned 180
      degrees from the gap in an adjacent ring along the horizontal
      plane. Thus, the first gap 34 may be positioned 180 degrees from
      the second gap 35. Similarly, the second gap 35 is 180 degrees
      from the third gap 36. Preferably, the size of the gap in each
      ring is the same. However, the size of the gap in each ring may be
      altered and each gap may be different in size from each other gap.<br>
      <br>
      The number of rings in the second chamber may be varied. By
      increasing the number of rings, the overall strength of the
      torsion field generated by the present invention would be
      increase, Conversely, reducing the amount of rings, reduces the
      overall strength of the torsion field. Furthermore, the strength
      of the torsion field may also be varied by changing the spacing
      between the rings.<br>
      <br>
      Each of the three rings may further include a ball member 37
      attached to each end of the each of the three rings. Each ball
      member is also preferably metallic, but may be any other material
      capable of inherently generating torsion fields. The diameter of
      each ball member may be varied and the diameter of each ball
      member is not necessarily the same diameter as any other ball
      member. The shape, size, and material of the ball members will
      affect the strength of the generated torsion field.<br>
      <br>
      The second chamber may further include an inert mass, preferably
      plastic. In one embodiment, the inert mass fills the second
      chamber, which holds the three rings in a predetermined position.
      The inert mass has no significant effect on the generation of
      torsion fields.<br>
      <br>
      The three rings, along with the associated ball members 37 act as
      topological resonators that generate two right static torsion
      fields, as shown in FIG. 3a. The right static torsion fields
      appears as a result of the local properties of topology of the
      three rings and the associated ball members.<br>
      <br>
      The first chamber and the second chamber are positioned such that
      at least one of the right torsion fields propagates through the
      salt solution. Thus, the first right static field propagates
      through the salt solution while the second right static torsion
      field does not. As shown in FIG. 3b, the interaction between the
      first right static torsion field generated by the rings and the
      torsion field generated by the salt solution increases the overall
      strength of the right torsion field generated by the present
      invention. Furthermore, because the first right static torsion
      fields is strengthened due to the interaction with the salt water,
      the strength of the second right static torsion field is also
      increased.<br>
      <br>
      In another approach, present invention may include a third chamber
      that also includes salt solution. The third chamber may be located
      adjacent to the second chamber on the opposite side from the first
      chamber. In this approach, both the first right torsion field 41
      and the second right torsion field 41 generated by the rings would
      propagate through a salt solution, further increasing the overall
      torsion fields generated by the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      In yet another approach, the salt solution and the ring may be
      disposed in the same chamber such that this salt solution
      surrounds the rings. In this approach, both the first right
      torsion field 41 and the second right torsion field 41 generated
      by the rings may propagate through a salt solution. <br>
      <br>
      Thus, the present invention using the salt solution in conjunction
      with the rings generates a first right static torsion field 42 and
      a second right torsion field 43 that are stronger than the first
      right static field 40 and second right static field 41 generated
      by the rings alone. Each of the right torsion fields 42 and 43 is
      individually significantly strong enough to repel a left torsion
      field generated by most electronic equipment. Although a left
      torsion field (not shown) is also generated by the salt solution,
      the strength of the left torsion field is negligible as compared
      to the two right torsion fields.<br>
      <br>
      As shown if FIG. 4, a television or monitor 50 typically generates
      a left torsion field 51 from the front of the television or
      monitor or television, towards the direction of the user, and a
      right torsion fields 52 towards the rear of the television or
      monitor.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention may be placed in front of the television or
      monitor, between the user and the electronic device. Preferably,
      the present invention is positioned such that either face 11 or 12
      of the outer body is directed substantially perpendicular to a
      cathode ray tube of the monitor or television (see FIG. 5). This
      ensures that the right torsion field generated by the present
      invention is substantially perpendicular to the left torsion field
      generated by the cathode ray tube. The present invention may be
      placed on the desk or counter between the electronic device and
      the user, or alternatively, it may be attached to a wall or
      ceiling.<br>
      <br>
      Since the right torsion field 40 generated by the present
      invention is perpendicular to the left torsion field generated by
      the monitor or television, the right torsion field 40 repels the
      left torsion field 51 and deflects the left torsion field 51
      generated by the monitor or television or monitor about 180
      degrees. (See FIG. 5) This forces the left torsion field 51
      generated by the monitor or television to overlap with the right
      torsion field 52 emanating from the rear of the monitor or
      television. Since the left 51 and right 52 torsion fields from the
      monitor are generated by the same source, the left torsion field
      and right torsion fields coincide and compensate for each other,
      effectively decreasing the effects of each field. This interaction
      creates a generally harmonized space surrounding the monitor such
      that there is a significant decrease in the presence of any left
      torsion fields in front of and behind the monitor.<br>
      <br>
      It should be noted that the present invention may be used to
      decrease the effects from torsion fields generated by any
      electrical equipment, including phones, vehicles, stereos, etc.
      For each device, the number of rings, the spacing between the
      rings, and the rare earth elements used may be altered in order to
      generate the appropriate right torsion field in order to repel the
      left torsion field from the associated electronic equipment.<br>
