        The invention is related to a device for accumulation,
        amplification and local direction of the positive cosmic energy.<br>
        <br>
        The technical problem which has to be solved by this invention
        concerns the construction of a device for accumulation,
        amplification and local direction of the positive cosmic energy
        that will enable, by using of a body consisting of two plates
        connected at an angle, with convexities and holes on the inner
        and outer surfaces of the plates, and an inner part of another
        body consisting also of two plates connected at an angle and
        with convexities and holes on the inner and outer surfaces of
        the plates, the efficient accumulation, amplification and local
        direction of the positive cosmic energy on to a limited space,
        so that within the range covered by the device, that being the
        area between its armes, there is the highest degree of condensed
        charge of the positive cosmic effects.<br>
        <br>
        The technical problem has been successfully solved by the
        suggested device for accumulation, amplification and local
        direction of the positive cosmic energy, the body of which
        consists of two plates connected at an angle with a number of
        convexities and holes on the inner and outer surfaces of the
        plates, while in the space between the plates i.e. armes of the
        housing, there is another piece also consisting of two plates
        connected at an angle, with a number of convexities and holes on
        the inner and outer surfaces of the plates.<br>
        <br>
        Owing to this construction, in the area covered by the device
        i.e. between the arms of the body, there is the highest degree
        of condensed charge of the positive cosmic effect which causes
        changes of the physical values such as magnetic field, magnetic
        induction, electric resistence, electric voltage, capacity and
        ionization.<br>
        <br>
        Because of the small coverage range between the arms, this
        device is specially suitable for the local application, in other
        words for treating of certain parts of the human body i.e.
        affected points.<br>
        <br>
        The enclosed drawing explains the invention in details.<br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fig. No. 1</span> shows the
        view in direction of the arrow A from the Fig. No. 2<br>

        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fig. No. 2</span> shows the
        cross-section D-D from the Fig. No. 1, and<br>

          Fig. No. 3</span> shows the view in direction of the arrow B
        from the Fig. No. 2<br>
        <br>
        According to the stated drawing, it can be seen that the
        innovation about the device for accumulation, amplification and
        local direction of the positive cosmic energy is that between
        the V-shaped arms (11) of the support (1) there is a piece (2)
        inserted. The piece (2) is also V-shaped and it is fixed tightly
        by its arms (21) between the covexity (17) and a
        semi-cylindrical convexity (13) on the arms (11). At the end of
        arms (11) there are cylindrical convexities (11') over which, at
        the angle od 90 degrees in relation to their longitudinal axis,
        ther is a convexity (12). At the end of convexities (11') there
        is a cylindrical convexity (13) which extends along the whole
        width of the arms (11). On the outer surface of arms (11) there
        are three holes (15) on each side, respectively, and spherical
        convexities (14) around them.In the space between these holes
        (15) and the point where the arms (11) meet, there are two
        hemispherical convexities (16) on each side. On the arms (21) of
        the piece (2) there are three holes (24) on each side and they
        are lined with convexities (23). On the space among the holes
        (24), support (1) connecting point and the piece (2) there are
        two hemispherical convexities (25) on the inner surface of the
        armes (21) and two hemispherical convexities (22) on the outer
        surface of arms (21) at the point where the arms meet.<br>
        <br>
        Exposure of the organism to the stated effects of the device
        ensures the optimal supply of the missing bioenergetic and other
        positive cosmic influences required by the organism to restore
        the optimal harmonious relation - balance with the forces of
        nature. Due to the action of the various causes of bioenergetic
        blockades in the organism (psychological causes, negative
        radiation and injuries), the organism decreases its ability to
        achieve such a relation and therefore the cosmic energetic
        currents cannot actualize their positive influence on it. Such a
        limitation disturbs the total harmony or the organism, thus
        affecting the level of vitality, since the absence of any factor
        which is a component of vitality reduces the possibilities of
        existence of the optimal programme of vital processes in the
        organism and thus makes it less able to perform its functions.<br>
        <br>
        The device, applied locally, breaks the existing blockades
        within the organism by its focal action and enables the
        restoration of balance which favourably influences the
        optimization of the vital processes through harmonious
        bioenergetic system. Owing to these features, this device
        provokes a high degree of psycho-physical relaxation and
        recreation.<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
