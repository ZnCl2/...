            <span style="font-weight: bold;">Pyramid energy installation</span></big><br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></div>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
        </span>The invention refers to a pyramid energy installation
        with an outside power consumption mechanism planned on the
        pyramid. Such an pyramid energy installation is in the DE-OS 35
        39 610,5-33 described.<br>
        <br>
        With the known pyramid energy installation the made power
        consumption by means of one from the top swinging pot put on on
        the pyramid. Electrical conductions continue to lead the energy
        then to Chakra electrodes. Such a swinging pot, which consists
        usually of brass, is costlier in its fabrication and has the
        functional drawback that does not become detected of it the
        entire swinging us spectrum from the basis to the tip of the
        pyramid.<br>
        <br>
        The invention is the basis the object to train a pyramid energy
        installation that in such a manner initially mentioned type that
        can become detected with their power consumption mechanism the
        entire vibration spectrum of the pyramid.<br>
        <br>
        This object becomes according to invention dissolved by the fact
        that the power consumption mechanism is an helical conductor led
        around the entire pyramid.<br>
        <br>
        By this design much high degrees become pyramid energy received
        with very simple agents in one. That made without intermediate
        resonance. The energy becomes immediate fed into the conductor.
        Further the entire vibration spectrum from the basis to the tip
        of the pyramid becomes detected. Since the power consumption
        mechanism has an advancing and a leading away leader end, two
        terminals are available for the forwarding of the pyramid
        energy. Thus the pyramid energy installation can become
        particularly favourable in medicine and technique used. It is
        for example possible to vitalisieren with such an pyramid energy
        installation in the continuous-flow process for the horticulture
        and in the land, forest and water management water by pyramid
        energy. By spraying also with pyramid energy loaded water
        landflat in their unnatural radioactivity can become reduced.
        Measurements with the Geiger counter have shown that radioactive
        loaded water, which became the action of pyramid energy exposed
        exhibited afterwards significant smaller, radioactive values.<br>
        <br>
        Also fuels or foods, for the example of beverages, can become in
        the continuous-flow process in their radioactive load reduced.<br>
        <br>
        By the pyramid energy installation according to invention
        pyramid energy is available free of charge for medical,
        biological and technical purposes and in unlimited amount.<br>
        <br>
        Particularly simple is the power consumption mechanism designed,
        if the conductor has the form of a conical spiral.<br>
        <br>
        To the other simplification it contributes, if the conductor on
        the edges of the pyramid rests upon.<br>
        <br>
        Developing a pyramid energy installation at the place of work is
        to be accomplished particularly rapid, if in accordance with
        another embodiment of the invention of the helical bent
        conductors by belts, ropes or similar linked so with one another
        and/or. connected is that its form remains existing with the
        lifting of the pyramid.<br>
        <br>
        A likewise very simple, modified embodiment of the invention
        consists of the fact that the conductor runs interiorlaterally
        along, a cylindrical supporting ring helical coiled set over the
        pyramid.<br>
        <br>
        The conductor is simpler to windings, if it runs outside along,
        a cylindrical supporting ring helical coiled transmissive set
        over the pyramid for the pyramid energy.<br>
        <br>
        The energy radiated of the pyramid point becomes in particularly
        high degrees upward the received, if in accordance with a whole
        particularly advantageous embodiment of the invention of the
        conductors with its line part deriving the energy over the tip
        of the pyramid guided is.<br>
        <br>
        In principle around the pyramid led conductors can be either an
        electrical cable or a tubular body. In the first case one can
        lead then the received energy across electrical conductions for
        example to Chakraelektroden. In the second case will it possible
        to leave by the conductor formed as tubular bodies for example
        liquids flow so that take up this immediate pyramid energy.<br>
        <br>
        The invention permits many embodiments. Three of it are in the
        drawing shown and become subsequent described. This shows in<br>

        The figs 1 and 2 show a pyramid 1, which with a basic edge in
        north south direction aligned is. Around this pyramid a
        conductor 2 is to a conical spiral from downside upward the
        opposite clockwise direction in such a manner coiled that these
        on its edges mount. With this conductor 2 it cannot concern
        around in or multi-core, shielded electric cable or however a
        tubular body transmissive for pyramid energy, becomes
        through-passed by which a liquid (for the example water, milk,
        juices, fuel) or a gas. The spiral formed by the conductor 2 is
        so among themselves linked by belts 3, ropes or similar in its
        turns that the leader spiral remains existing with the lifting
        of the pyramid 1. The conductor portion leading away from the
        pyramid 1 4 is over the pyramid point guided, so that he is able
        to take up the there radiated energy.<br>
        <br>
        The energies radiated of the pyramid meet the turns of the
        conductor 2, which takes up them and either to the Mediums
        flowing through it continues to give or if a conductor an
        electrical cable is, into electrical conductions feed, which are
        connected at it.<br>
        <br>
        The embodiment in accordance with the figs 3 and 4 differs from
        the before described by the fact that the conductor 2 rests upon
        not the edges of the pyramid separates slight distance of these
        has. A commercial holder 5 holds the conductor 2 in the
        illustrated position. It leads at the same time the conductor
        portion 4 above the pyramid point vertical upward, so that the
        pyramid energy diverting over the pyramid point meets this
        conductor portion 4. The holder 5 the permitted pyramid power
        consumption in a far vibration spectrum of the pyramid, even if
        the line end piece becomes 6 offset in movement.<br>
        <br>
        In accordance with the figs a cylindrical supporting ring 7 is
        from the top inverted 5 and 6 over the pyramid 1. Along the
        inner wall of this supporting ring 7 the conductor 2 in an helix
        runs. Its energy exhausting conductor portion 4 runs again over
        the pyramid point and is by means of a front recess 8 in the top
        of the supporting ring 7 maintained.<br>
        <br>
        With the embodiment in accordance with the figs 7 and 8 the
        conductor is 2 outside 7 coiled on the supporting ring. The
        supporting ring 7 consists here of a material transmissive for
        the pyramid energy. Precise one as with the preceding embodiment
        is the exhausting conductor portion 4 placed over the pyramid
        point. <br>
