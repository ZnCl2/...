        Abstract</span> -- The device comprises, for example, a pyramid
      of dielectric material having the dimensions, as true to scale as
      possible, of the Cheops pyramid and in a size corresponding to the
      use to which it is put. The collector effect of the pyramid, one
      edge of which is to be aligned to magnetic north, bundles the
      positive pole energy of the magnetic earth field in the energy
      core of the device. As in a mirror image, "reflected" force fields
      with negative energy result above and below the pyramid. a) By
      appropriately positioning a person in, above or underneath the
      pyramid it is possible to supply the bundled energy resulting from
      the collector effect of the pyramid to the person in order to
      balance out energy disturbances of the body. b) If the
      subject-matter of the application is used for the continuous
      automatic material recovery a pyramid of appropriate size is to be
      fitted over the metal part (e.g. bearing) in such a way that the
      part is located within the energy core of the pyramid and the
      pyramid is aligned to the direction of magnetic north/south. <br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Description</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      a) The energies acting in the human body are predominantly
      electrical and magnetic nature.<br>
      <br>
      The ratio minus to the pluspoligen energies is in the healthy body
      balanced. To the elimination of disturbances in the equilibrium or
      of blockades one can supply missing energies to the body. During
      the supply of such energies there are already various methods, but
      should the human body if possible such energies supplied become,
      which correspond to the actual bio energy. Such an energy is the
      magnetic Erdfeld in which we lives.<br>
      <br>
      The body with its high water content is an excellent antenna and
      takes current from the surrounding field over the skin and the
      Chakras life energy on from the various power systems of the earth
      and the sun. If this energy balance becomes foreign waves or by
      crossing jet strips disturbed, then the control of the body turns
      out in disorder over its centers (brain, glands) and it leads to
      diseases. The regulation should not take place then better also
      physical and chemical!!<br>
      A simple energetic collector for the magnetic Erdfeld is the
      pyramid from dielectric material. To use are also a
      Pyramidenstumpf, a cone or truncated cone o. A. appropriate
      geometric shape. The energy of the magnetic Erdfeldes of approx.<br>
      <br>
      0.7 Gauss becomes by the giebelförmige position of in each case
      two surfaces, in magn. Nord-Süd-bzw.<br>
      <br>
      East west direction aligned are, in the range of the center in the
      bottom of the pyramid (energy core) in quadruple starch collected.
      The energy is strongest in approximately 1/3 of the height of the
      pyramid over the center of the base surface (focal point).<br>
      <br>
      The effect of this energy bundling became already in a patent No.
      91,304 for the Prager radio Inge nieur Karl Drhal with a
      “pharaonischen Rasierappa RSR (Rasicrklingen pyramids regenerator)
      recognized.<br>
      <br>
      With this apparatus a razor blade laid down in the energy core of
      a pyramid, which is northward aligned, becomes again sharp after
      use within 24 hours.<br>
      <br>
      Within the pyramid, in the energy core, we olarität very strong
      Plus. Lateral ones of it are energetic zero-zones. (Comparisons
      fig. 1). Since after the Newton' law the universe continuous must
      be in an equilibrium, is the inference that each force or energy
      must have also a counterpart or a reaction energy field. These
      reaction energy fields for the energy core of a pyramid are to be
      proven radiästhetisch also at any time. The position of such
      energetic “reflected” pyramids with their entgegengesetztpoligen
      energy cores is in fig. 2 shown. The reflection made multiple, but
      decreases its starch with increased removal from the real pyramid.
      The focal points of the reflected pyramid are appropriate for
      vertical in each case over the Apex (pyramid point) in subsequent
      height B1 = 1/3H B2 = 5/3H B 3 = 7/3 dog so away, whereby B is the
      height of the focus and H the plumb bob-high of the pyramid.<br>
      <br>
      By the corresponding layer of humans either in the pyramid, over
      it or among them, it is now possible to supply it the bundled
      energy resultant from the energetic collector effect of the
      pyramid either as pluspolige energy in the pyramid or as
      minusspolige energy over or the bottom pyramid in each case in the
      corresponding distance (S.<br>
      <br>
      Fig. 3). It is natural important to have before recognized whether
      the disease became by a too little or a too much one at
      minuspoliger energy or by a too little or a too much at
      pluspoliger energy caused. The treatment has to take place then
      corresponding.<br>
      <br>
      To mention it is still that the pyramid should be if possible on a
      scale of the Cheops pyramid. The mass of this pyramid are: Basis=
      2 height; Schenkel= base 1.051 inclination angles 51 51 ' 51 " is
      it convenient to specify the height first.<br>
      <br>
      It is maintained that colored pyramids, inside and. o.<br>
      <br>
      outer, which increase energetic effect in the sense of the Color
      therapy. I could not prove this fact so far yet, since I however
      as possible regard an effect, should the possibility of a
      corresponding colour with component of my application be. (The
      wavelengths of the color should correspond to the wavelengths of
      the tax main centers and tax bottom centers of the human body).<br>
      <br>
      b) In case of the application of the registration counter of
      conditions for current automatic material recovery a pyramid
      corresponding in the size is like that over the metallic part (z.
      B. To attach bearing) that this is in the energy core of the
      Pyradmide and the pyramid is in the north south direction aligned.<br>
      <br>
      The operability and reason became already detected with the patent
      for the “pharaonischen shaver”. <br>
