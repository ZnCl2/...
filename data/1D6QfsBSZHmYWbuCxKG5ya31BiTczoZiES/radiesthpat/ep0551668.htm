      Inventor:&nbsp; SURBECK JACQUES<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract </span>-- The resonator
      consists of a mixture of rare earth compounds contained inside a
      plastic sphere of small diameter. The mixture of rare earth
      compounds is based on cerium, lanthanum and scandium. A resonator
      is placed in the top left corner of the frame of the cathode-ray
      screen and a similar resonator, but of different composition, in
      the bottom right corner of this frame, these resonators becoming
      resonant under the effect of the electromagnetic radiation
      produced by the screen and creating an energy field with counter
      phase which suppresses the harmful effects of this radiation on
      the user. Other applications of the resonators according to the
      invention comprise the protection of motor vehicle passengers from
      electromagnetic radiations produced by the vehicle's
      installations, the protection of the inhabitants of homes from
      electromagnetic radiations produced by high-tension electricity
      lines, amplification of the energy field of individuals and
      suppression of the residual radioactivity from nuclear waste.<br>
      <br>
      The invention relates to the protection, inter alia, of the users
      of apparatuses with cathodic screens and other generators of
      electromagnetic radiations against the noxious effects of the
      emitted electromagnetic radiations by these apparatuses.<br>
      <br>
      The cathodic screen apparatuses are now omnipresent, so much in
      our professional environment (computers, machines with word
      processor, terminals computer-based) that in our home environment
      (television sets, plays video). It is known that these apparatuses
      generate electromagnetic radiations of various ways, to the
      noxious effects whose the users are subjected, in particular those
      which remain talks pendent of enough long times at very low
      distance (50 to 60 cm) from the screens of these apparatuses, as
      it is the case for the professional users and also for the
      children who often tend to place themselves 'very close to the
      screen of the station television receiver to look at the
      programmes which interest them.<br>
      <br>
      Scientific workings revealed that, whatever the sex, an neonatal
      exposure to the electromagnetic radiations produced by the
      cathodic screens of computers with low power starts irremediably,
      with the age adult, a disturbance of the growth, a pollakiurie, an
      asthenia and a reduction in the painful reactional behaviors
      blaming a neurovégétatif dysfunction developer of a reaching of
      the hypothalamo-limbic axis, even thalamic.<br>
      <br>
      This experimental model, observed in the animal, of the ascribable
      disorders to the effects of the electromagnetic radiations of very
      low powers generated by the cathodic screens logically appears to
      be able to be transposed to the man and certain studies carried
      out with this subject in particular in North-American companies,
      without still being able to bring absolute conclusions, made it
      possible to raise an unusual rate of disorders of the pregnancy
      among women working regularly in front of a cathodic screen.<br>
      <br>
      After several years of searches, the inventor has uncovered in a
      surprising way that, by producing passive resonators made up of a
      suitable mixture of composed of rare earths and by laying out two
      such resonators in a suitable way on the frame of a cathodic
      screen one obtains creation between these resonators, which enter
      in resonance under the action of excitation of the electromagnetic
      radiation product by the cathodic screen when this one is lit, of
      an energy field to against phase which removes the noxious effects
      for the user of this electromagnetic radiation.<br>
      <br>
      Continuing his searches the inventor has uncovered that in a
      similar way, inside a motor vehicle, one removes the noxious
      effects for the passengers of the electromagnetic radiations
      products by various bodies of the vehicle by laying out inside
      this one two such passive resonators either on both sides of the
      instrument patch of the vehicle, or into diagonal between the
      instrument patch and the range rear of the vehicle. In the same
      way still, inside the genuine faraday cages consisted the
      residences with metallic elements, the occupants are protected
      noxious effects of the electromagnetic radiations produced either
      by electrical lines with high tension outside located, or by
      electrical appliances located inside, by laying out such a passive
      resonator with high concentration at the center of housing, or two
      passive resonators into diagonal inside housing.<br>
      <br>
      In accordance with the invention the resonator is thus
      characterized by the fact that it includes/understands, inside a
      nonmetallic element, a rare earth compound mixture, metals,
      metalloids and/or oxides. The mixture can include/understand to
      fourteen components, according to an unspecified precise order,
      under different temperatures being able to go from - 30 DEGREE C
      to + 200 DEGREE C.<br>
      <br>
      According to the finality of the use of the resonator, the rare
      earth compounds are selected, in an insulated or combined way,
      among the whole of the rare earths and in particular among the
      elements NR DEG 57 with NR DEG 72 of the table of periodic table
      of Mendeleïev.<br>
      <br>
      The aforementioned rare earth compound mixture is preferably
      containing Cerium, of Lathane and Scandium. In particular it can
      be consisted a composition containing in dilution of Cerium
      chloride, oxide of Lathane and Scandium chloride.<br>
      <br>
      The nonmetallic element containing the rare earth compound mixture
      is consisted a plastic sphere of low diameter, for example of a
      diameter of about 20, 25 mms, 38 mms to see 60 mms and more.<br>
      <br>
      In accordance with the invention, one lays out a resonator with
      the left upper corner of the frame of the cathodic screen to equip
      (place of occurrence of the spot) and a second resonator, like but
      containing a different composition, with the straight low angle of
      this screen (place of disappearance of the spot), so that these
      resonators can then enter in resonance when they are excited by
      the electromagnetic radiation product by the screen and to create
      an energy field with against phase which destroys the noxious
      effects of this electromagnetic radiation.<br>
      <br>
      Like one has it designated previously, for the protection of the
      passengers of a motor vehicle one will place two resonators on
      both sides of the instrument patch of the vehicle, or even into
      diagonal one on the instrument patch and the other on the rear
      range. Or, for the protection of the occupants of a housing with
      metallic elements one lays out either a single resonator with high
      concentration in the middle of housing, or two resonators into
      diagonal inside housing.<br>
      <br>
      According to another applying of the invention, one can amplify in
      a sensitive way by resonance the human energetic field, by thus
      increasing the immune capacity of resistance of the individuals.
      For this purpose one in accordance with the invention lays out two
      resonators with a low distance of the individual, for example at a
      distance of about 25 cm, the two resonators being laid out between
      them also by a low distance, about 15 cm to 20 cm.<br>
      <br>
      According to still another applying the resonators in accordance
      with the invention can be used to cleanse nuclear waste by
      removing by resonance the radioactive remanence, of the resonators
      for this purpose being laid out in determined positions compared
      to the terrestrial magnetic axis.<br>
      <br>
      For rendering comprehensible well the invention one will describe
      an example of effecting hereafter of it.<br>
      <br>
      a) One weighs 69,22 G of Cerium chloride which one pours in a
      measured balloon of 100 ml and one complete with water distilled
      until reaching the stroke of gauge. One then carries out a
      homogenisation by shaking of the balloon. One takes then 1 Cm3 of
      this dilution which one pours in a second measured balloon of 100
      ml, one again adds water distilled to reach the stroke of gauge
      and one carries out a homogenisation again. One repeats then
      successively a third then fourth once the operation of already
      described dilution.<br>
      b) One weighs 21,98 G of oxide of Lathane which one pours in a
      measured balloon of 100 ml, and one adds water bidistillée until
      reaching the stroke of gauge, then one homogenizes by shaking the
      balloon. One repeats this operation four times of continuation by
      taking with each time 1 cm of preceding dilution.<br>
      c) One weighs 16,842 G of Scandium chloride which one pours in a
      measured balloon of 100 ml and one adds water bidistillée in
      sufficient amount to arrive at the stroke of gauge, then one
      homogenizes by shaking of the balloon. One repeats this operation
      four times of continuation. by taking with each time 1 Cm3 of
      preceding dilution.<br>
      d) One mixture the fourth dilution of each phase has) with c) in a
      balloon of 100 ml and one homogenizes the whole. One then pours
      the mixture in a measured balloon of 1500 ml, one complete with
      water bidistillée to the stroke of gauge, then one homogenizes by
      shaking.<br>
      <br>
      One then takes an amount of final dilution obtained that one
      introduces inside plastic a tight mini-sphere of a diameter of 20
      mms who constitute the resonator wished according to the use of
      destination.<br>
      <br>
      For the fixed use one two resonators, as described above, like one
      with the other but of different compositions, with the left upper
      corner and the straight low angle by looking at the frame of the
      cathodic screen equipping. Preferably each present mini-sphere
      forming resonator externally a self-adhesive part facilitating
      fixing. The exact site of the two resonators at the ends of
      diagonal of the cathodic screen is carefully selected so that one
      is with the angle of occurrence of the spot of scanning of the
      screen and the other with the angle of disappearance of this spot.
      When the apparatus equipped with the CRT is put in running, the
      resonators enter immediately in resonance under the excitation of
      the electromagnetic radiation of the screen and create an energy
      field with against phase which removes the harmful effect of this
      radiation.<br>
      <br>
      Experiments were carried out on several pilot families, according
      to defined protocols hereafter:<br>
      <br>
      specimen “A”: witness of reference. nonexposed with the radiations
      of a screen,<br>
      specimen “B”: witness exposed to the radiations. to 50 cm of a
      cathodic screen without apparatus of protection,<br>
      specimen “C”: witness exposed to the same distance, the radiations
      of the same screen equipped with the safety system consisted two
      resonators in accordance with the invention.<br>
      <br>
      The results obtained in the different experiments are designated
      below.<br>
      <br>
      1 DEG) test of cell proliferation in culture: the specimens A and
      C present the same results at the level of cellular division,
      whereas the specimen B present a mitosis (cellular division)
      faded;<br>
      2 DEG) test of mortality on breedings of flies drosophilas of
      Charolle strain: the rate of mortality noted is 14% for the
      specimens A and C, whereas it is 32% for the specimen B;<br>
      3 DEG) test of growth of young rats: the weight measuring is
      identical for the specimens A and C, whereas they are 20% low for
      the specimen B;<br>
      4 DEG) test open field practised on rats after their puberty:
      identical results for the specimens A and C, whereas all the
      members of the specimen B present signs of irreversible of their
      development neuro-endocrinien and hypo-thalamo-limbic alteration;<br>
      5 DEG) analysis with the Raman-laser of the structures of water
      molecules distilled exposed during 8 hours at a distance of 50 cm
      of a cathodic screen, specimen a: linear, specimen b:
      déstructurées energies and specimen C: safeguarded energies;<br>
      6 DEG) analysis by Kirlian photo of same water, exposed in the
      same conditions that in test 5: for the specimens A and C one
      notes that the energies are displaced, but safeguarded whereas for
      the specimen B the energies are déstructurées and disappeared to
      65%.<br>
      <br>
      It spring thus clearly of these tests which the resonators in
      accordance with the invention prevent, during an exposure to low
      distance from a cathodic screen, harmful effects caused by the
      emission of the electromagnetic radiations to induce physiological
      disturbances or dysfunctions at the users.<br>
      <br>
      It will be understood that description above was given as example,
      without restrictive character, and that constructive additions or
      changes could be brought there without leaving the frame of the
      invention. <br>
