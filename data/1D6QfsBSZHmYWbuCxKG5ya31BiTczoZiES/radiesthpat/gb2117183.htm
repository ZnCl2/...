        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract</span> -- Apparatus
        for protecting living organisms against geo-biological radiation
        comprises a series of layers of spaced apart electrically
        conducting metal rods 9. The rods in each layer are parallel to
        each other and are held in an electrically insulating holder
        member 1-4 of plastics material. The members 1 to 4 are clamped
        together by a knob 8 on a rod 5 which is screwed into a pedestal
        7. The rods in adjacent layers are shown at 90 degrees to each
        other, but this angle can be adjusted by loosening the rod 5,
        turning the holder members and then tightening the rod again. <br>

        <br>
        This invention relates to apparatus for protecting living
        organisms from geo-biological radiation.<br>
        <br>
        Apparatus for this purpose is known, for example<br>
        <br>
        German Patent Specification No. 950 589 describes an apparatus
        for the attenuation of electromagnetic waves consisting of a
        plurality of metal rings, which are disposed concentrically in a
        plane or co-axially one above another and are metallically
        connected together. <br>
        <br>
        Furthermore, German Patent specification No. 526 039 discloses
        the use of a metal screen consisting of a wire mesh, which is
        connected through at least one electrical conductor to a
        lightening conductor or is otherwise earthed. This earthing
        through an electrical connection has, however, proved to be
        disadvantageous, because the apparatus cannot be positioned
        anywhere at random on account of the electrical connection.
        Moreover, such an electrical connection is also a nuisance.<br>
        <br>
        The aforementioned and other similar apparatus serve for
        protecting living organisms against earth radiation, if this
        occurs in a concentrated form as a consequence of an underground
        disturbance, for example an underground water course. Radiation
        concentrated in this manner gives rise to perturbing radiation
        fields and influences the energy flow of the human body. This
        can lead to illness.<br>
        <br>
        The known apparatus has, however, not proved especially
        effective in addition to having the aforementioned disadvantages
        and it is accordingly the object of the present invention to
        provide apparatus for the above purpose which is characterized
        by simple construction and high efficiency.<br>
        <br>
        To this end, according to this invention, such an apparatus
        comprises a plurality of conductor rods mounted in a holder.<br>
        <br>
        The conductor rods are preferably metallic, for example of
        brass.<br>
        <br>
        Such rods can, for example, be made by simply cutting lengths
        from a wire and be mounted without difficulty in a holder. The
        rods are preferably straight and extend parallel to one another
        in a holding member, which determines the mutual spacings
        between the rods. The rods may, however, alternatively be
        cranked.<br>
        <br>
        The holding member may be of plastics material and constitutes,
        together with the conductor rods disposed therein, an
        independent structural element. A plurality of these elements
        may be arranged one above another, so that an apparatus
        comprising a plurality of layers of rods results. The rods in
        adjacent layers are preferably perpendicular to one another.<br>
        <br>
        To enable the individual layers of rods to be adjusted in an
        optimum manner to any particular radiation pattern encountered
        and to individual requirements, the individual layers are
        preferably mounted so that they are angularly adjustable to each
        other, In this manner the conductor rods can be adjusted layer
        by layer relative to one another. This is of especial advantage
        in that, as has been demonstrated by measurements, the
        protective effect of the apparatus is dependent upon the
        orientation of the rods of adjacent rod layers. The holding
        member and a pedestal preferably possess detent grooves or
        splines facing each other to maintain the holding members in any
        angular position in which they are set.<br>
        <br>
        An example of an apparatus in accordance with the invention is
        illustrated in the accompanying drawings in which:~<br>
        Figure 1 is side view of the apparatus; and,<br>
        Figure 2 is another side view of the apparatus as seen in a
        direction at right angles to Figure 1.<br>
        <br>
        The apparatus comprises four similar holding members 1, 2, 3, 4,
        which are disposed perpendicularly one above another and through
        which a screw threaded anchor rod 5 extends.<br>
        <br>
        The anchor rod 5 is screwed into a screw threaded socket 6 in a
        pedestal 7 and carries, it its upper end a clamping knob 8. By
        means of this knob 8, the holding members 1 to 4 can be clamped
        one against another and in this manner held in a specific
        orientation. Meshing detent grooves or splines, not illustrated
        in the drawing, on the holding members engage one into another
        to hold the members 1 to 4 in the required angular positions in
        which they are set.<br>
        <br>
        Through each of the holding members, four parallel spaced-apart
        conductor rods 9 extend.<br>
        <br>
        The rods 9 are of an electrically conducting material and
        adjacent layers of the rods are offset through 900 one from
        another. The angle between adjacent layers of the rods can be
        adjusted as desired by rotation of the individual holding
        members relative to one another after the clamping knob 8 has
        been loosened. In this manner the apparatus can be adapted to
        local circumstances and individual needs.<br>
        <br>
        Comprehensive tests have demonstrated that, with the apparatus
        in accordance with this invention, concentrations of earth
        radiation which are harmful to health can be broken down.<br>
