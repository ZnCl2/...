        Inventor:&nbsp; PEQUIGNOT MICHEL&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
        Processing of the fluid: S by radiations (light or different) is
        subjected to two constrained main. :<br>
        <br>
        1. The need to operate with the shelter of the air in order to
        avoid the secondary actions: mainly intense oxidation due very
        often to the ionization of ambient oxygen by the radiations to
        use; 2. The need to present fluid, always somewhat or
        substantially the not transparent one with the radiations; in
        very thin layers.<br>
        <br>
        In the methods and apparatuses, used for this purpose, one
        generally makes pass the fluid one to treat between two walls,
        transparent, either in webs .de low thickness, or divided in
        channels of small dimension<br>
        <br>
        parents of very low diameter.<br>
        <br>
        The industrialization of the preceding apparatuses is blocked by
        their low flow:<br>
        function of the fluid pressure, this last being rapidly limited
        by the low resistance of materials used (glasses, quartz, etc).
        A fortiori, their employment is impossible in operations in
        front of necessarily being carried out with ha.ute pressure
        (chemical syntheses, fluid treatment containing of dissolved
        gases, etc).<br>
        <br>
        In addition, the homogeneity of the processing is there always
        very. defective, in consequence of the unequal pressure
        distribution, in the tubes or channels, and especially of the
        irregularities<br>
        <br>
        the inherent inaccuracy with the material and the machining
        necessarily employed.<br>
        <br>
        It is known indeed that the flow, of a .canal of low section is
        proportional with the fourth power of his diameter, which leads
        for low differences of this last to extremely variable flows.<br>
        <br>
        It is to be also noticed that, the field of the radiations
        intended to act, either on a beam of tubes, or on, faces:
        internal and outer of a sleeve, is not uniform, whatever the
        ingeniousness of the systems employed, and that, same if it were
        it, the play of the incidences and the indices of refraction of
        the transparent materials, make that the different generators of
        the irradiated surfaces, are it very unequally.<br>
        <br>
        The present invention has as an object a method which makes it
        possible to cure these disadvantages and to increase the
        effectiveness and the flow of the apparatuses with irradiation.<br>
        <br>
        According to this method which comprises the displacement of
        fluid to treat in the sanaux ones subjected to Faction of the
        radiation source, one combines with the longitudinal moving
        speed of fluid, the shape of the channels which ensures a
        swirling relative movement of fluid pendent its passage in front
        of the source radian .e. Thanks to this mouvemnt, one creates
        inside the fluid mass in movement at the same time of the
        molecular internal slips and a rotation of the mass fluid- on it
        same. So all the molecules of the mass with will trai er come
        successively in contact with the active surface limiting the
        flow channel. It results from it that all the parts of the fluid
        mass in movement are subjected, with the radiation and that the
        activation is very homogeneous.<br>
        <br>
        Following a mode of setting in uvre of the method, the relative
        swirling movement is obtained by not making R the fluid mass in
        shaped channels of circular propeller around the radiant source.
        With this provision, the fluid flowing one in each channel is
        subjected to the centrifugal force due to its circular movement,
        ac ion which is added to those resulting of lives of flow and
        the section of the channel, to ensure a relative movement which
        creates a stirring int nse of the molecules and ensures their
        regular exposure to the radiation of the source.<br>
        <br>
        For the application of this method, one realization <br>
        <br>
        inside a metal tube where they can be readily machined with
        precision (like the scratches of a firearm). Dams the tube me Al
        with inner channels, is introduced another tube, this one
        transparent with the radiation and surrounding the radiating
        source.<br>
        <br>
        Inner surfaces of the 'metallic and outer ube of transparent
        tube coïncid-NT exactly; fitting is obtained from it by lapping,
        of fate:. what each channel plot in the opaque material is
        closed with its free surface by a material window transparent?
        -.<br>
        <br>
        With this apparatus, one obtains on the same tube a precise
        series of channels of dimensions', pusiqu' they are machined in
        metal, the surface of the tube transpar' NT smooth and being
        simply rectified. These channels allow an equal distribution of
        fluid resulting in equal losses in load in the different
        channels all the flows, and whatever the intake pressure. This
        advantage could not be obtained with the known apparatuses where
        the channels are entirely carried out in the material
        transparency, that hereinafter not being able to be exactly cut
        or molded with dimensions specified.<br>
        <br>
        The apparatus made up at the same time by a metallic wall and an
        inner tubular transparent member is particularly rési.stant with
        the pressure. Whereas the conventional apparatuses are
        exclusively made up out of somewhat resistant transparent
        material, in the apparatus in accordance with the invention, the
        outer part supporting the efforts of extension is carried out in
        metal and can support without difficulty of the vées pressures
        él. it left transparent<br>
        <br>
        &lt;EMI ID=4.0&gt;<br>
        <br>
        which it resists readily. One can thus use pressure raised,
        therefore to carry out substantial flows. Moreover the apparatus
        resists the incidental overpressures readily (water hammer).<br>
        Moreover, the apparatus comprised only one rédui.e part out of
        transparent material, which allows a saving of this material<br>
        <br>
        &lt;EMI ID=5.0&gt;<br>
        <br>
        vée of the shocks, which R Nd the resistant and somewhat brittle
        apparatus.<br>
        <br>
        Another essential advantage, when they are industrial
        apparatuses, resides in the possibility da instantaneous
        disassembling of the body of flow in two parts. The cleaning
        operation, which is a quasi impossible problem in the
        apparatuses comprising a body indémontable, is easier here.<br>
        <br>
        It be: to also notice that single the apparatuses of the object
        kind of the invention, employs a single producer of radiations,
        which constitutes a considerable saving, which makes it possible
        in addition to obtain with the central position of the radiant
        source inside the transparent tube, a perfectly uniform field of
        radiations, essential factor of the homogeneity of the
        processing.<br>
        <br>
        The method and the apparatus making the object<br>
        <br>
        &lt;EMI ID=6.0&gt;<br>
        <br>
        all the fluid ones. Thus they can be used for the activation of
        milk by the rays: ultraviolet or for the processing of other
        liquid such as the Vin. They. can also be put in uvre for the
        processing by irradiation of gases, for the gaseous syntheses
        for example. They are applicable, that they which are the
        radiations used: light, actinic, radioactive or simply caloric.<br>
        <br>
        The annexed drawings represent, with; title of example, an
        embodiment of the following apparatus the invention.<br>

        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Figure 1</span> is a part in
        perspective out of longitudinal cut of an element. Figure 2 is
        transverse a-cut following line II-II of figure 1. This
        apparatus is made up. by a metallic envelope 1, for example out
        of stainless steel. With the inner surface of this tubular
        portion 1 are machined Des., helical grooves 2 of suitable step,
        for example, a corresponding step with the length to-<br>
        <br>
        &lt;EMI ID=7.0&gt;<br>
        <br>
        for the third time an unspecified regular geometric .section,
        the best adapt one with the improved efficiency and the facility
        of execution was determined as being that of a triangle will
        equip with deadened angles. Inside envelope 1 is laid out a tube
        out of transparent material with the radiations considered. For
        example if they are rays, ultraviolet, the tube is out of molten
        quartz, the outer surface is rigorously gauged and polished.<br>
        <br>
        Tube 3 extends on both sides beyond outer tube 1. Inside tube 3
        and at the center - 'laid out the source radiating 4 finds, such
        as a generator of ultraviolet (tubular lamp with mercury vapor
        or other). With this source can be associated. a selector filter
        - not represented.<br>
        <br>
        The ends, of envelope 1 are connected to collectors: intake
        manifold 5, collector of delivery 6. The connection with
        transparent tube 3 is ensured by D S joined suitable comprising
        a plastic element 7 clamped on support 8. The fluid one to treat
        is brought by collector 5. Arrived at the left end; tube 1, it
        can pass only in helical channels 2. Dimensions of those are
        determined so that the fluid one takes there the speed necessary
        with its swirl in the aforementioned channels. The particles of
        fluid are thus highly brewed, whereas the rotation of the fluid
        vein on itself successively brings them all in contact with the
        part of channels 2, limized by the surface of transparent tube
        3. They are thus subjected to the irradiation of source 4.<br>
        <br>
        Following the requirements, of the flow and the duration of
        sensitizing of fluid, a certain number of element identical with
        that which has been just described are grouped in series or
        parallel. Especially, one carried out substantial flows with a
        single construction, by the parallel circuit of several tubes 1
        and 3 on collectors 5 and 6. These element 1-3 are superimposed
        without complication and without. sensitive increase of the
        obstruction.<br>
        <br>
        Of course, the description which precedes does not aim of an
        embodiment of the invention. All variants, of application of the
        method return in the object of present the bre-. vet.<br>
