      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A year ago, Mr John E Moray
          of the Research Institute, Inc, at Salt Lake City addressed
          this conference by giving a paper entitled "Recovery of
          Minerals from Low Grade Ore by High Energy Bombardment". Among
          other things, this paper outlined some of the recent success
          which his organization had experienced in the recovery of
          gold, silver and platinum from low grade ores. A study of the
          many experiments carried out by Mr Moray and his coworkers,
          with assays made by a wholly independent firm, of ore samples
          before and after irradiation by the Moray process, is indeed
          most impressive. I find no avenue of escape whereby the
          validity of these experiments can be dismissed lightly.
          Transmutation of elements from one element to another, either
          one rung higher on the ladder of atomic weights, or one lower,
          is no longer considered phenomenal. What is unique and of
          great interest in the work of the Research Institute is that
          its workers appear to have discovered a way of causing a rapid
          buildup of atoms of relatively low atomic weights to those of
          much higher atomic weighs such as silver, platinum and gold.
          My services were solicited in an effort to find out just what
          could be going on in these experiments to make such a result
          possible. To give a brief outline of what this process appears
          to be is the reason for my presence today.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">First of all, I will cite on
          of several tests carried out n an effort to ascertain whether
          the modus operandi was actually one of transmutation from
          elements of low atomic weights to those of the noble metals. A
          solution was prepared --- made up of Baker's reagent quality
          solid chemicals of the highest purity and water, distilled by
          boiling. These bottled chemicals list the trace materials
          which might be existent in them in very small amounts. Gold
          did not appear on any of these lists even in trace amounts. No
          atoms of higher atomic number than 19 were present in quantity
          in this solution. Silver has the atomic number 47, and gold
          79. This prepared solution of pure chemicals in glass
          containers was irradiated by high energy photons for about one
          minute and then by evaporation the residue was dried and sent
          to an independent assayer company for analysis. I hold a copy
          of their report in my hand. It reads 929.76 oz/ton of gold and
          113.04 oz/ton of silver. The value of gold per ton in this
          residue is quoted at $32,506.60 [1965 prices].</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Gentlemen, it is my
          carefully considered opinion that this experiment, along with
          many other experiments involving low grade ores, marks a
          turning point, a new era if you will, in mining history and
          the production of precious metals.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">How can modern physics
          explain the experiment I have just described? In 1952, two
          research workers, Nagaoka and Miethe, reported the production
          of gold: first by irradiation of mercury and paraffin oil by
          an electric spark from an induction coil capable of giving a 4
          foot spark in air, and second, by a heavy mercury vapor arc at
          atmospheric pressure. Our knowledge of atomic structure at
          that time was so meager that these experiments were
          unexplainable in orthodox terms. Other experimenters tried to
          duplicate this work and failed. The whole idea was discounted
          and dismissed on the basis that there were "no theoretical
          grounds for supposing the process possible".</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Today we live in a new era
          of physics. In 1925 the atom was theoretically composed of
          electrons and protons. But today, modern nuclear physics has
          revealed by theoretical study and experimentation involving
          radioactive particles, cosmic rays, and high energy particle
          accelerators, that there are other particles in the nuclear
          structure of the atom. The neutron, the positron, the photon,
          the neutrino and antineutrino, the mu and pi mesons, and at
          least 16 other strange particles have been discovered. Just
          how all these particles will fit into the final basic
          structure of the nucleus of the atom is the present problem of
          modern nuclear physics. In the words of Wehr and Richards,
          "Let us hope that of this chaotic riddle will come a profound
          and simplifying answer. We may be likened to those who knew
          only Ptolemy's complex description of the solar system. What
          we need is a Copernicus to assimilate and interpret the data
          with a generalization which will not only solve the riddle but
          lift our sights to levels we cannot now foresee."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">But let us go back to our
          problem. To gain some understanding of what is going on in our
          experiment, we can pretty well rule out by input energy
          considerations all the particles mentioned except the proton,
          the electron, the photon, the neutron, and the neutrino. The
          interactions between these particles are beginning to be
          understood, although much remains to be discovered. What we
          have learned thus far has, however, enabled theoretical
          physicists to devise theories as to the manner in which the
          elements we now find in the universe were originally put
          together by nature herself. The theory set forth by Professor
          Gamow and his co-workers is the most popular and widely
          accepted. It explains how, under proper physical environment
          all the atoms in the universe, from the lightest to the
          heaviest could have been built up in the relative abundances
          in which we now find them, within the short period of
          approximately 35 minutes. The necessary starting point of this
          theory consists of a huge dense mass of neutrons which is
          suddenly subjected to great expansive motion. This is thought
          to resemble the state of the universe some 5 billion years
          ago, and is sometimes referred to as the Big Bang Theory of
          the Expanding Universe. Neutrons are radioactive. When free
          they naturally decay into protons, electrons and neutrinos.
          But protons, which are hydrogen nuclei, and indeed all nuclei,
          are known to capture neutrons and combine with them (4). In
          this reaction the captured neutron merges with its captor and
          upon the emission of an electron forms a new nucleus of an
          element one rung higher on the ladder of atomic numbers. Once
          commenced, the buildup of atomic nuclei can proceed at a very
          rapid rate. In very brief outline this was, according to
          Gamow's theory, nature's original modus operandi of making the
          elements. Now within the Moray experimental solutions which
          were under high energy photon bombardment, the situation is
          quite different from that of 5 billion years ago as just
          described. We do, however, have much in common with the Gamow
          Theory of nuclear evolution. Under intense high energy photon
          bombardment, the solution of chemicals will necessarily suffer
          much high molecular disassociation and atomic ionization.
          There are excellent reasons for expecting that within the
          liquid, a dense atmosphere of slow neutrons will be formed by
          excited proton capture of free and orbital electrons. The vast
          majority of these neutrons, we know, and its subsequent
          emission of an electron, will give rise to the elevation of
          that nucleus to a new increased atomic number. The atmosphere
          within the liquid should abound with high energy photons, or
          x-rays, and with neutrinos, all aiding in the formation of
          neutrons and their subsequent capture by nuclei undergoing
          rapid transmutation. This, briefly, is the preliminary picture
          of the process which we visualize as taking pace in these
          experiments.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A point of great interest in
          the experimental test I have described in some detail is that
          the specks of gold found in the residue of the solutions
          reveal a marked crystal structure under microscopic
          examination. It is a coincidence that Miethe, back around
          1925, had found his formation of gold to be in small crystals
          also. I have examined one of these specks with a microscope
          and have seen the beautiful fold colored crystal pattern. One
          must conclude from this that the process we have described is
          in reality a crystal growing bath activated by irradiation. As
          the gold atoms come into being by transmutation, they become
          gregarious, which results in the crystal formation.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">From this observation there
          is every reason to suspect that low grade ores and mine
          tailing provide, not only seed for crystal growth, but also a
          nuclei environment which is well advanced, or uniquely
          favorable, for the formation of the precious metals by
          transmutation.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In conclusion, then, what
          can be said for this upgrading transmutation process which has
          suddenly appeared as an applied baby of neutron physics? The
          potentialities of this transmutation process appear so
          prodigious that I hesitate to predict its possible future. It
          might well influence and possibly shape the future production
          of not only the noble metals, but of all metals as well as
          other elements including those that are rare. One thing seems
          certain to me, and that is that we are witnessing the dawn of
          a new day in the God-given dominion of man over his physical
          environment. The horizons appear rich in promise for the
          mining industry! Personally, I feel privileged to be
          associated with his new field of research.</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Last year at this time Mr
          John E. Moray spoke on the "Recovery of Minerals from Low
          grade Ore by High Energy Bombardment". Early work in the field
          of transmutation and photodisintegration reactions was
          discussed, including first the use of natural radioactive
          sources of bombarding particles, and more recently the use of
          various particle accelerators. It is now known that many
          elements can either be built up by the capture of these
          particles or broken down by collisions with them.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Although recoverable amounts
          of several metals have been produced, our work has been
          primarily aimed at increasing the yields of the precious
          metals, particularly gold and silver. Early work done with
          specially made irradiation equipment was described a well as
          later tests made on commercially available particle
          accelerators. These tests gave yields of from 50 to 100 ounces
          of gold per ton and as much as several hundred ounces of
          silver per ton. It must be mentioned at this time that when
          virtually no gold or silver values can be determined in the
          raw ore (i.e., they assay from trace to a few hundredths of an
          ounce of gold per ton), after irradiation and drying the gold
          and silver can be identified by standard fire assay or any
          other normal determination method.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Early in 1964, when Mr
          Rudolph and I began work on the process, the primary problem
          was to develop a solution environment which could be
          reproduced consistently and at a cost which would permit
          commercialization of the process. With little information
          available, it was done mainly by trial and error.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">During this work a number of
          different ores were used along with many solution. Originally
          this complicated the problem but later added to the useful
          information as we found that a solution which worked well with
          one ore would not necessarily give any yield with another ore.
          This led to the development of several good solutions, one or
          several of which will work well on most ores.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">None of these solutions
          require any aging, that is, they can be used immediately after
          mixing. They can, however, be stored without adverse effects.
          All can be produced at a cost of $50 or less per 100 gallons.
          This is approximately the volume of solution required to
          process one ton of ore.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The ores we have used fall
          into three main categories. All contain from trace to a few
          hundredths of an ounce of gold per ton. Although we have tried
          higher grade ores, they seem less adaptable to this process.
          The increase in values is much less than in low grade ores.
          One type of ore is simply low grade unprocessed gold ore. The
          second is mill tailings. This type has a number of advantages
          such as being inexpensive, available in large quantities, and
          already ground. For these reasons a great deal of work has
          been done with this type of ore with excellent results. The
          third variety of ore is natural sand. Although fewer different
          ores of this type have been tried, they also have usually
          given good yields.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When it became evident that
          our results with one particular ore and solution combination
          were consistently high, it was decided to being a pilot
          operation with this combination. The irradiation unit which we
          had been using at our laboratory would process only a small
          amount of ore per day, but it was felt that production on this
          unit would teach us a great deal about commercialization of
          the process.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Since all out sample work
          had been done in glass and porcelain containers, we began
          testing various materials to determine what type of handling
          equipment could be used. To our surprise the reaction was
          found to be quite sensitive to interference to nearly every
          other material. Plastics could not be used, nor could
          stainless steel, or most varieties of rubber or brass. Copper
          could be used if it was in one continuous piece. Although we
          do not fully understand this interference, indications are
          that it is due to electrostatic charge or particle position in
          the solution.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">To avoid interference, the
          ideal handling system would be all glass, but with a limited
          time schedule as well as a limited budget, this was
          impossible. A conveying system was finally chosen to move the
          slurry under the irradiation dead. Our system consisted of a
          mixing tank outside the radiation chamber with a hand-operated
          valve for filling the conveyer dishes. The conveyer moved the
          material under the radiation beam, then dumped it into a catch
          tank. A screw conveyer them moved it out of the radiation
          chamber to drying tanks.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Heavy gauge sheet copper was
          used to build the mixing tank. Since all available mixing
          devices were made of metal, we were forced to construct our
          own. This was done with a wood shaft and a wooden airplane
          propeller. The valve on the tank was probably our greatest
          problem. We tried a number of different ones during our month
          of operation. These included resin-coated gate and quick-open
          valves, and an assortment of others which we made out of wood
          and wood and copper combinations. Although our efforts
          improved, this problem was never completely solved.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The conveyer was also a
          "do-it-yourself" project as nothing of the type needed was
          available. We built a chain type conveyer and mounted pyrex
          baking dishes on it. A grain auger was used to convey the
          material back out of the radiation chamber.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The system was definitely
          crude but it provided a wealth of information, both on
          handling methods and materials and on their effects on the
          reaction.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Or present plans for a
          commercial operation do not include a conveyer system. We
          originally tried a pumping system but, because of the
          difficulty of securing a slurry pump which would not
          interfere, we were forced to use the conveyer. Recent work has
          shown that we can bypass this problem by using suction rather
          than a pump. This facilitates having an all glass system since
          the slurry would not come in contact with the suction pump.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">During the last year we have
          made more than 1200 tests with assays on each of these. In
          conjunction with the 200 plus tests run in the 3 years
          previous and a number run before that time, these give an
          extensive backlog of information on the reaction. These
          include both the practical aspects of the process and work to
          develop and prove the theory of the reaction.</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">I became involved in the
          mineral recovery process in February 1964 in an effort to
          standardize the environmental solution used on our ore
          samples. Our first samples were irradiated on a Betatron and
          showed no commercially feasibility results. Since we planned
          an active test program, an irradiation unit large enough for
          our testing and pilot plant operation was purchased.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">We began testing on this
          unit using different solutions and ore samples. For the first
          50 tests, low yields were obtained. Then, six samples yielded
          from 4 to 7 ounces of gold per ton. Efforts to duplicate these
          samples failed, however. Then, using the same solutions on a
          different ore. Results ranging from 6 to 9 ounces per ton were
          obtained. Attempts to duplicate these samples were successful
          and later attempts to refine the solution raised the yields to
          the range of 8 to 10 ounces per ton. As we investigated
          further, we began to find out more about the reaction and our
          yields went up to the 100 to 200 ounces per ton range using
          solutions which were cheap enough to be commercially feasible.
          The overall average of all these tests was 128.5 ounces per
          ton.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">At this time we set up a
          small pilot plant in our lab in order to check out several
          handling systems. Because of the constant experimentation, no
          great amount of material was ever run through the pilot plant.
          The final total was about 800 pounds when the pilot plant was
          adjudged a success and shut down. This pilot plant used
          production size samples but ran at a slower rate than a
          production operation would, so that a good indication was
          given of what yield we could expect in a production operation.
          The overall average of this plant was 19.2 ounces per ton.
          However, because the production size samples were quite large
          for our plant, the standard deviation was quite high.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Although our pilot plant
          average was high enough to show commercial feasibility, we
          wanted to get the standard deviation down to a level so that
          we could predict with 99% accuracy that our operation would be
          commercially feasibly. We also felt that it was time to check
          these slurries on a larger irradiation unit to see if it gave
          similar results. We decided to conduct these tests in two
          series, the first to be a statistical test to determine what
          variables gave significant differences in yield and the
          second, to determine which settings of these variables gave
          the best yields. It was felt that if these tests would show a
          99% assurance of commercial feasibility, no further tests
          would be necessary as we would be sure to get even higher
          yields in production when we had the optimum operating
          conditions pinpointed.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">For these tests we traveled
          to Varian Associates in Palo Alto, CA to rent time on their 8
          Mev Linac. In the first series of tests, we tested dose, dose
          rate, slurry depth, shield material, electron volts setting,
          shield height, and distance from sample from irradiation head.
          The shield was a thin sheet of material placed over the sample
          when irradiating with an electron beam. In main effects, only
          electron volt setting showed up as significant, with the high
          voltage setting being better than the low. In addition,
          several interactions between variables showed up as being
          significant. An interaction between two variables means that
          when either variable is changed singly, the results remain
          unchanged, but when the two variables are varied together, a
          significant difference results. Statistically speaking,
          interaction between more than two variables is extremely rare;
          however, with the number of interactions between two variables
          which we encountered, I would say there is a good chance that
          interaction between three variables or perhaps even more may
          be present. The following interactions seemed to be the
          significant ones:</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(1) Shield height - voltage</font>
        <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">(2) Dose rate - voltage</font>
        <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">(3) Dose -voltage</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">(4) Distance of sample from
          head - shield height</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">(5) Solution depth - shield
          material</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">(6) Slurry depth -voltage</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">These results all tend to
          indicate that a higher voltage would give much better results.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In the next series of tests,
          we set the machine so that the significant interactions would
          be at their best settings and tested doe and dose rate. This
          was done in order to get some idea of what production rates
          could be expected. The second series showed that does and dose
          rate were probably significant as we were able to show
          differences at different settings and got a sine curve effect
          on our graphs which would tend to break sown our earlier
          statistical tests on these two variables as the tests were
          designed for straight line or exponential variations. With
          these later tests we were able to find better operating
          conditions which give better yields. We felt that these
          conditions might be best evaluated in production as it would
          be much cheaper and easier then to set up an evolutionary
          operation testing program while running production and these
          tests were already enough to prove commercial feasibility.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A total of 56 production
          size samples and 6 beaker tests were irradiated on the Linac.
          Using these as a basis of calculation, it was possible to get
          a fairly accurate figure to indicate what we could expect in a
          production operation. The 6 beakers were included because they
          were of a production nature also.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In spite of the fact that
          these tests were conducted at a wide range of machine settings
          in our search for optimum conditions, we still averaged 15.16
          ounces of gold per ton. Statistical calculations show that we
          can be 97.5 % certain that even at these conditions our
          production average would be better than 10.51 ounces of gold
          per ton. Since in a production operation we would be operating
          at optimum conditions at all times, the average is almost sure
          to be higher than this. These calculations show that with a
          small risk involved, a yield of around 15 ounces of gold per
          ton can be anticipated. We also found that a dose of 0.16,
          0.5, 2.0 and 4.0 megarads gave the peaks on the sine curve for
          dose. A dose rate of 4 megarads per minute gave the highest
          peak on the dose rate curve.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Since that time we have
          irradiated several more samples on the Linac and very few have
          shown any worthwhile results. Since the earlier statistical
          results show that there is an extremely small chance that this
          drop in results could occur without a specific cause, we have
          not been too concerned about these results. We believe that a
          small change in our test procedure, which we thought
          insignificant at the time, has caused the results to drop,
          although we have not yet had an opportunity to check out this
          theory.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">On the basis of our
          statistical results, we are sure the process holds great
          possibilities for the mining industry, and recommend that the
          industry adopt the process of ore irradiation before milling.</font>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">There is ample scientific
          evidence that the theory and experimental findings obtained in
          the field of particle transformation by bombardment with
          high-energy particles to enhance the recovery of minerals
          prove the research reports and accomplishments presented by
          the Research Institute are sound and correct. Scores of the
          world's greatest scientists agreed that this type of reaction
          can be had. Nearly every element has now been converted into
          other elements by bombardments with high-speed particles.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">More than a thousand nuclear
          reactions are now known, an astonishing development since the
          first induced nuclear reaction in 1919. The long-awaited
          flower of transmutation, breeding, disintegration "aging",
          call it what one will, has now broken into full blossom. The
          great number of energy reactions requires a systematic
          correlation and explanation which is developing into a new
          field of nuclear research and associated chemistry and
          electronic engineering.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Early experiments in the
          field of transmutation pioneered by Lord Rutherford, Chadwick,
          Curie, Joliot, etc., utilized natural radioactive sources to
          provide bombarding projectiles. This source of energy has now
          given way to electrical systems of particle acceleration. The
          techniques of artificial acceleration have put transmutation
          on a totally different plane. The accomplishments of great
          scientists are not longer surprising. It is no longer
          considered impossible to cause an artificial transmutation.
          Though there are still unanswered questions about the
          reactions and of this energy release, it has been established
          that transmutations have been accomplished by the protons,
          neutrons, deuterons, alpha particles, and other projectiles
          brought into play by high energy accelerators.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This bombardment of matter
          with high energy particles has placed in our hands a powerful
          method of studying the artificial transformation of the nuclei
          of ordinary elements, not just radioactive elements. Proof
          exists that many of the ordinary elements (those without
          radioactive isotopes) also consist of a mixture of isotopes.
          An isotope may be defined as any two or more forms of an
          element having the same atomic number and similar chemical
          properties but differing in atomic weight and radioactive
          behavior. The accepted atomic weight of an element is the
          average of the nuclear masses of all the isotopes the atom may
          contain. In some cases it is possible for the nucleus of an
          isotope to exist in more than one energy level. This is
          thought to be due to the higher having a higher angular
          momentum. This phenomenon (isomeric transition) gives rise to
          two routes of decay. It has been established that when a
          particle penetrates into a nucleus, Coulomb's law of repulsion
          no longer completely regulates the particles' behavior. In
          other words, the bombardment of the atoms of ordinary elements
          has resulted in the disintegration of the nucleus of the atom
          with the expulsion of a swift proton and resultant
          transformations. There is now evidence that science can not
          only cause a disintegration of a nucleus with loss of mass,
          but can also build up a nucleus of greater mass by the capture
          of colliding particles.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It has actually been found
          possible to induce nuclear transmutations by use of radium C
          whose energy is only 5.5 Mev and below the energy barrier of
          the nucleus. Speaking of this, Dr Cork said: "This
          incompatibility was reconciled by the wave-mechanical
          treatment of the process. Wave mechanics coincide a finite
          probability for a particle with an energy less than that of
          the peak of the barrier being able to penetrate it". The
          greater the energy of the particle and the lower the barrier
          the greater the possibility of its passage.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It is also felt by this
          laboratory that the resonant energy levels become important in
          the transaction. If a particle is propelled at a resonant
          frequency toward a nucleus by use of an electronic means, the
          barrier may be overcome and transition take place.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Transmutations by the
          bombardment of matter with high energy particles being well
          established, it must now be accepted that the long sought goal
          of changing one element into another element is an established
          fact. This was first accepted as being accomplished in 1936
          when platinum was changed into gold.</font> </p>

          scientists, Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassman, were bombarding
          uranium atoms with neutrons. As had happened they expected the
          uranium atoms to absorb the neutrons. Instead, when the
          neutrons hit the uranium, the atoms split, forming two new
          elements, barium and krypton.</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This equipment is to some
          extent a prototype if what is used in the famous laboratories
          of America and Europe where extensive research in this field
          is being done. Reports from Germany and England give proof of
          success in this field, at least on a laboratory scale.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">With all the great successes
          of others, what do the developments from the Research
          Institute, Inc., have to offer which differs from that which
          is presently being accomplished by others?</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The Research Institute
          followed on the work of its predecessor, the Moray Scientific
          Laboratories, which began research in this field in 1923 and
          followed during the years since 1940 and more extensively
          since 1954. Unique means have been devised to cause this
          reaction under controlled methods with consistent results with
          the addition of (for lack of a better terminology without
          disclosing too much) a catalyst (a flux or reduction agent, an
          environment). This is how out development differs from others,
          combined with the bombardment of the material under treatment
          by an energy "bombardment tube" developed specially for the
          Research Institute.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It has been shown that known
          laws of nuclear physics and known astronomy processes lead to
          the acceptance that element building is now known to be an
          accomplished fact. The new ideas on element building in stars
          coming from the work of many astronomers only further prove
          the fact that element building does occur.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Breeders that "grow" more
          particles of matter through nuclear reaction in proportion to
          the energy consumed in their production prove it s feasible to
          utilize the vast supply of isomeric material of unaged
          geological formation and "cook" them by the use of particle
          acceleration from their present stage to another stable atom.
          This means minerals contained in the material in its
          "unstable", "geological unaged" state that has not been
          effected by cosmic bombardment, which are not rich in
          recoverable values can by radiation bombardment, be transmuted
          to a stable, higher mineral content ore.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">What practical results can
          accrue to the mining industry by the development of this
          method of processing?</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The conclusion reached after
          years of practical experimentation and research in analyzing
          the nature, character and commercial feasibility of values
          existing in these forms of mineral deposits, clays, and sands,
          show that herein lie the true and greatest mineral values of
          the world. Although they are not always determinable to
          commercial assayers before bombardment, their recovery by
          properly developed bombardment by particle acceleration in a
          "suitable environment" in highly commercial quantities is
          possible.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This could mean existing

      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Recovery of Minerals from
            Low Grade Ore by High Energy Bombardment ~</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It has been observed as
          early as 1940 that after bombardment of low grade ores in an
          "environment" with high speed electrons and x-rays,
          considerably larger amounts of various metals within the ore
          were identified chemically and by fire assay. It has also been
          observed that by varying the environment around the ore, the
          changes that took place within the ore were also varied. The
          studies that were performed up until 1948 were all of a
          concentrated material with a high cost of concentration and
          handling; therefore, it was felt that the process was not
          commercial.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">From 1950 to 1953, our
          attention turned to the reactions involved in working with
          uranium ores. Uranium ores at that time were receiving
          considerable attention and government support. It was observed
          that as the raw uranium ore was irradiated and otherwise
          processed under proper conditions, fairly large amount of
          uranium could be recovered. For instance, on May 16, 1958,
          using a sample that ran 0.29% uranium oxide before
          irradiation, the assay was 21.9% after. Since the average Utah
          ore was 0.23% uranium oxide, it was felt that this would be a
          boon the uranium industry. Recovery after professing and
          irradiation would vary with ores as much as from 7.03% up to
          75% uranium oxide. No silicates were removed. This was not a
          concentration of the material. In 1955 we proposed that the
          AEC investigate such a project and see what might be done to
          "age" uranium ores. After Dr Marvin of the AEC spent several
          months investigating the sample we supplied, it was reported
          that no ore of the type we presented existed in the United
          States except by the process of aging which they admitted we
          seemed able to do. We proposed that a breeding type reaction
          could be accomplished by the bombardment of low grade ores
          with high energy particles or x-rays in the presence of a
          proper environment. At this time we were unsuccessful in
          obtaining a contract from the AEC. It was disclosed later that
          breeding reaction investigations were being conducted by the
          AEC in Arc, Idaho (<i>Scientific American</i>, January 1960).
          We still feel our method is cheaper and more efficient that
          the process used at Arco.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The study of uranium oxide,
          however, paid for itself in that it opened up new ideas in an
          approach top breeder reactions for other types of mineral
          bearing ores. In 1958 we altered the uranium breeding reaction
          process and specifically adapted it to the recovery of gold,
          silver and platinum ores.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The first step toward a
          commercial process was the production of the environmental
          solutions. Solutions made as late as September 1962 were not
          fully aged until January 1963. Considerable amounts of
          solutions were tested under subcontract by reliable testing
          laboratories for quality control, stability, and chemical
          makeup. This report will not deal with the chemical
          composition of the test solution. It should be pointed out
          that solutions manufactured at the present time need only a
          one-day aging period.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Toward the end of 1961 two
          problems emerged:</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(1) Determination whether
          the high energy irradiation is entirely dependent upon a high
          frequency carrier wave, or whether the irradiation equipment
          can be the typical DC particle accelerator type that is
          available on the open market.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(2) Attainment of a stable
          configuration of the "local environment" so that the solution
          may be manufactured in large quantities over a short period of
          time. This will enable its production to more than equal the
          production rate by irradiation of material.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The initial effort in the
          investigation was to determine whether the present commercial
          particle accelerators such as High Voltage Engineering, Allis
          Chalmers, General Electric, Westinghouse, International
          Harvester and Radiation Dynamics would be usable as an
          irradiation source. It was determined that a technician would
          be sent to Massachusetts to perform these tests, using
          standard "local environment" that had been in storage and had
          proven successful since 1945. The unit initially picked to do
          the irradiation was the High Voltage Engineering particle
          accelerator (Burlington, Mass.) The tests considered 100
          ounces of gold as 100% and showed the following % reactions:</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(a) 49.3%</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">(b) 5.9%</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">(c) 4.3%</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Sample (a) gave 57.9 ounces
          of platinum per ton of sample, All samples showed
          approximately 230 to 248 ounces of silver per ton. The
          solution used for sample (a) was not readily producible and
          consisted of material produced in 1945.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Solutions used in samples
          (b) and (c) evidently did not respond adequately to the
          high-speed electrons. These solutions had been tested several
          times previous to this using our own radiating equipment,
          giving an average result between 69 and 82% reaction and
          showing a very high amount of silver at various times. This
          research also disclosed that over-irradiation gave a
          deterioration rate and loss of values indicated.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">At this point it was decided
          that further investigation of power plants and particle
          accelerator tubes should be conducted.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A series of tests were
          started that would test solutions and then retest solutions
          after variations were made. It was found that a solution could
          be varied, if it had aged, and aging of the solution became a
          problem as chemical reactions continued to take place die to
          hydration and changes of storage temperature.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Tests were made at Rockford,
          IL on the Electronized Chemicals Corporation's Particle
          Accelerator using the principle of the magnetron to deliver
          power to the accelerator tube. The results indicated that even
          though a standard solution was obtained that sufficed for our
          particular power plant needs, the losses were still too great
          with a particle accelerator of this type. The samples were
          irradiated at 11.4 Mev and from 1 megarad to 20 megarads. The
          average % yield was between 8 and 9%. This would indicate that
          a production rate of 5 tons per day may be obtainable.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The amount of platinum
          present after irradiation using a standard solution is very
          low. Using standard test methods and our laboratory particle
          accelerator, the reactions with solutions of this type have
          run from 107% to 329%. From 135 to 426 ounces of silver have
          been present. No platinum was indicated. The lack of platinum
          would be attributed to (a) the energy level of the irradiating
          source, (b) the chemical composition of the "local
          environment", and (c) target.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It is believed this
          environment furnished particles similar to the cosmic ray
          reaction on the atmosphere. Research work indicates that the
          radiation must be composed of both high-speed electrons and
          x-rays.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The x-ray performs the
          photodisintegration and the electron furnished both the energy
          and amperage to the reaction. It is suspected that because the
          escaping electrons have a certain amount of energy, a certain
          amount of x-rays will be produced in the material by the
          electron's reaction (Compton Effect). The ideal reaction, it
          is indicated, is for the x-rays to be produced at a target
          located somewhere outside the accelerator tube where losses of
          energy will be at a minimum.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Recent experiments conducted
          in August 1963 using a Radiation Dynamics' Linear Particle
          Accelerator gave very interesting results.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Three samples were prepared.
          The first sample was divided into two section, the second
          sample divided into three sections, and the third sample
          divided into three sections. The first sample contained a
          reagent grade material, the second sample contained sand from
          Glen's Ferry, Idaho, and the third sample contained sand from
          near Rexburg, Idaho. None of the samples contained more than a
          trace of gold or silver and the first sample contained the
          reagent grade material carried by Chemical Supply House.
          Sample #A2 was irradiated using a special target without
          benefit of "environmental solutions" at 750 kilovolts and 1/2
          megarad dose. The result of this test showed 0.12 ounces of
          gold per ton, and 0.5 ounces of silver per ton.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Sample A3 was irradiated
          using special target without the benefit of "environmental
          solution' at 1.5 Mev, 1/2 megarad giving the results of 0.26
          ounces of fold per ton and 0.18 ounces of silver per ton.
          Samples 1A, 2B and 3b were irradiated at 750 kilovolts, 1/2
          megarad with special target in the presence of special
          environment with the following results:</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">1A contained 17.2 ounces of
          gold per ton, and 6.1 ounces of silver per ton.</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">2B contained 48.8 ounces
          gold, 291.2 ounces silver per ton.</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">3B contained 20.2 ounces
          gold, 13.9 ounces silver.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Samples 1B, 2C and 3C were
          irradiated at 1.5 Mev, 1/2 megard through special target in
          chemical environment. The reactions were as follows:</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">1B, 100 ounces gold, 45
          ounces silver.</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">2C, 63.2 ounces gold, 225.4
          silver.</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">3C, 81.92 ounces gold, 44.5
          ounces silver.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">We feel this performance
          approximated our reaction and is an indication of what is
          taking place with our equipment here at the laboratory.
          Further studies are being performed. Our findings are the
          results of more than 200 tests that have been conducted within
          the last three years and the results of many more tests
          performs and conducted dating back to as early as 1939.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The conclusions reached
          regarding the reaction are that this reaction is dependent
          upon the following factors:</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(1) The isomers of the
          isotopes reacted upon must be present in the ore before the
          ore will react to the reaction.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(2) These reactions are
          dependent upon the type target in order to control the
          frequency of the quantum energy level.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(3) High energy electrons
          must be present in the ore as well as x-rays.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(4) The composition of the
          environmental solution to furnish other particles that are
          freed by the action of the resonant frequency x-rays and the
          electrons produced by the particle accelerator.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(5) The reaction is a
          dose-rate reaction and not dependent upon velocity. The
          velocity of the original particles will determine depth and
          time of reaction only.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The possibility of
          developing a commercial process by bombarding raw ore
          described above in the presence of a proper environment is
          feasible. The energy levels involved are not above those that
          can be easily obtained by present particle accelerator
          equipment. It is obvious that these energy levels in the
          proper environment are much lower than had been expected and
          are lower than had been demonstrated by other researchers. It
          is no longer a question of whether these reactions will take
          place, but a question of locating the ores that most readily
          respond to this type bombardment under the proper environment.</font>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The history of the mineral
          recovery process could be very extensive as it covers a period
          of Dr Moray's work from 1935 to date. However, just as a brief
          description, we wish to submit the following:</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">For years, researchers have
          claimed that large quantities of the noble metals could be
          detected in ores that, under our present recovery and assaying
          procedures, appear to have very little or no noble metal
          content before handling with elaborate separating or treating
          systems. We are convinced that these so-called treating or
          separating systems may have had some basis beyond that of
          fooling the investigators because of the techniques that they
          happened to be using. On the other hand, some may not have
          been reliable in the first place. However, we do not have to
          remind the reader that chemistry grew out of alchemy. One of
          the best examples of a successful researcher in this filed was
          C.W. Nalder of San Francisco, CA who developed a device in the
          early '40s that obtained from desert sand and lake bottoms
          sufficient of the nonferrous metals to pay for the operation.
          This device was operated over a period of time and processed
          approximately 90 tons of ore per day.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">From time to time The
          Research Institute has been approached by various individuals
          of work on such a project. In 1940 an organization from
          southern California brought what was called "Shinly Shale" to
          The Research Institute and asked us to investigate the
          possibility of separating mercury from said ore. Indication
          brought out in our laboratory showed that this ore did contain
          some mercury which was easily lost without properly handling.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As the Research Institute
          has always used a high energy approach, it became a matter of
          pattern to bombard such low grade ores at energy levels as
          high as 24 Mev and to handle these ores under varying exacting
          laboratory conditions. Early in 1940 it became apparent that
          considerable amounts of noble metals could be detected in the
          ore after bombardment and that the idea had merit.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">From 1950 to 1953, our
          attention turned to the reactions involved in working with

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The first step toward a
          commercial process was the production of the environmental
          solutions. Solutions made as late as September 1962 were not
          fully aged until January 1963. Considerable amounts of
          solutions were tested under subcontract by reliable testing
          laboratories for quality control, stability, and chemical
          makeup. This report will not deal with the chemical
          composition of the test solution. It should be pointed out
          that solutions manufactured at the present time need not to be
          aged.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Toward the end of 1961 two
          problems emerged:</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(1) Determination whether
          the high energy irradiation is entirely dependent upon a high
          frequency carrier wave, or whether the irradiation equipment
          can be the typical DC particle accelerator type that is
          available on the open market.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(2) Attainment of a stable
          configuration of the "local environment" so that the solution
          may be manufactured in large quantities over a short period of
          time. This will enable its production to more than equal the
          production rate by irradiation of material.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The initial effort in the
          investigation was to determine whether the present commercial
          particle accelerators such as High Voltage Engineering, Allis
          Chalmers, General Electric, Westinghouse, International
          Harvester and Radiation Dynamics would be usable as an
          irradiation source. It was determined that a technician would
          be sent to Massachusetts to perform these tests, using
          standard "local environment" that had been in storage and had
          proven successful since 1945. The unit initially picked to do
          the irradiation was the High Voltage Engineering particle
          accelerator (Burlington, Mass.).</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Early in 1964 when Mr Tom
          Rudolph and Mrs Ruth L. Hendricks began to work on the
          process, the primary problem was to develop a solution
          environment which could be reproduced consistently and at a
          cost which would permit commercialization of the process. With
          little information available, it was done by trial and error.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">During this work, a number
          of different low-grade ores were used along with many
          solutions. Originally, this complicated the problem but later
          added to the useful information as we found that a solution
          which worked very well with one ore would not necessarily give
          any yield with another ore. This led to the development of
          several good solutions.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">None of these solutions
          require any aging; that is, they can be used immediately after
          mixing. They can, however, be stored without adverse effects.
          All can be produced at a cost of $50 or less per 100 gallons.
          This is approximately the volume of solution required to
          process one ton of ore.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The ores we have used fall
          into three main categories. All contain from trace to a few
          hundredths of an ounce of gold per ton. Although we have tried
          higher grade ores, they seem less adaptable to this process.
          The increase in values is much less than in low grade ores.
          One type of ore is simply low grade unprocessed gold ore. The
          second is mill tailings. This type has a number of advantages
          such as being inexpensive, available in large quantities, and
          already ground. For these reasons a great deal of work has
          been done with this type of ore with excellent results. The
          third variety of ore is natural sand. Although fewer different
          ores of this type have been tried, they also have usually
          given good yields.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When it became evident that
          our results with one particular ore and solution combination
          were consistently high, it was decided to being a pilot
          operation with this combination. The irradiation unit which we
          had been using at our laboratory would process only a small
          amount of ore per day, but it was felt that production on this
          unit would teach us a great deal about commercialization of
          the process.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Since all out sample work
          had been done in glass and porcelain containers, we began
          testing various materials to determine what type of handling
          equipment could be used. To our surprise the reaction was
          found to be quite sensitive to interference to nearly every
          other material. Plastics could not be used, nor could
          stainless steel, or most varieties of rubber or brass. Copper
          could be used if it was in one continuous piece. Although we
          do not fully understand this interference, indications are
          that it is due to electrostatic charge or particle position in
          the solution.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">At this time we set up a
          small pilot plant in our lab in order to check out several
          handling systems. Because of the constant experimentation, no
          great amount of material was ever run through the pilot plant.
          The final total was about 800 pounds when the pilot plant was
          adjudged a success and shut down. This pilot plant used
          production size samples but ran at a slower rate than a
          production operation would, so that a good indication was
          given of what yield we could expect in a production operation.
          The overall average of this plant was 19.2 ounces per ton.
          However, because the production size samples were quite large
          for our plant, the standard deviation was quite high.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A total of 9 production runs
          were made. The first two were 100 pounds of dry ore each; the
          rest were 200 to 250 pounds of dry ore each. These were run
          during June-August 1964. The table below gives dates and
          results. The tie between runs was spent modifying, improving
          and repairing the handling equipment whenever difficulties
          arose or changes seemed to be called for.</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It was found that 200 pounds
          of ore could be run in about 7-1/2 hours of continuous
          operation. Samples were taken periodically during each
          production run. Variations in assays among different samples
          from one run can be attributed to differences in sampling
          technique, experimental changes during the run, and
          differences in drying temperature, all of which cause marked
          differences in yield.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Although our pilot plant
          average was high enough to show commercial feasibility, we
          wanted to get the standard deviation down to a level so that
          we could predict with 99% accuracy that our operation would be
          commercially feasibly. We also felt that it was time to check
          these slurries on a larger irradiation unit to see if it gave
          similar results. We decided to conduct these tests in two
          series, the first to be a statistical test to determine what
          variables gave significant differences in yield and the
          second, to determine which settings of these variables gave
          the best yields. It was felt that if these tests would show a
          99% assurance of commercial feasibility, no further tests
          would be necessary as we would be sure to get even higher
          yields in production when we had the optimum operating
          conditions pinpointed.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">For these tests we rented
          time on an electron beam accelerator. In the first series of
          tests, we tested dose, dose rate, slurry depth, shield
          material, electron volts setting, shield height, and distance
          from sample from irradiation head. The shield was a thin sheet
          of material placed over the sample when irradiating with an
          electron beam. In main effects, only electron volt setting
          showed up as significant, with the high voltage setting being
          better than the low. In addition, several interactions between
          variables showed up as being significant. An interaction
          between two variables means that when either variable is
          changed singly, the results remain unchanged, but when the two
          variables are varied together, a significant difference
          results. Statistically speaking, interaction between more than
          two variables is extremely rare; however, with the number of
          interactions between two variables which we encountered, I
          would say there is a good chance that interaction between
          three variables or perhaps even more may be present. The
          following interactions seemed to be the significant ones:</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(1) Shield height - voltage</font>
        <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">(2) Dose rate - voltage</font>
        <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">(3) Dose -voltage</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">(4) Distance of sample from
          head - shield height</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">(5) Solution depth - shield
          material</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">(6) Slurry depth -voltage</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">These results all tend to
          indicate that a higher voltage would give much better results.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In the next series of tests,
          we set the machine so that the significant interactions would
          be at their best settings and tested doe and dose rate. This
          was done in order to get some idea of what production rates
          could be expected. The second series showed that does and dose
          rate were probably significant as we were able to show
          differences at different settings and got a sine curve effect
          on our graphs which would tend to break down our earlier
          statistical tests on these two variables as the tests were
          designed for straight line or exponential variations. With
          these later tests we were able to find better operating
          conditions which give better yields. We felt that these
          conditions might be best evaluated in production as it would
          be much cheaper and easier then to set up an evolutionary
          operation testing program while running production and these
          tests were already enough to prove commercial feasibility.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A total of 56 production
          size samples and 6 beaker tests were irradiated on the Linac.
          Using these as a basis of calculation, it was possible to get
          a fairly accurate figure to indicate what we could expect in a
          production operation. The 6 beakers were included because they
          were of a production nature also.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In spite of the fact that
          these tests were conducted at a wide range of machine settings
          in our search for optimum conditions, we still averaged 15.16
          ounces of gold per ton. Statistical calculations show that we
          can be 97.5 % certain that even at these conditions our
          production average would be better than 10.51 ounces of gold
          per ton. Since in a production operation we would be operating
          at optimum conditions at all times, the average is almost sure
          to be higher than this. These calculations show that with a
          small risk involved, a yield of around 15 ounces of gold per
          ton can be anticipated. We also found that a dose of 0.16,
          0.5, 2.0 and 4.0 megarads gave the peaks on the sine curve for
          dose. A dose rate of 4 megarads per minute gave the highest
          peak on the dose rate curve.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Since that time we have
          irradiated several more samples on the Linac and very few have
          shown any worthwhile results. Since the earlier statistical
          results show that there is an extremely small chance that this
          drop in results could occur without a specific cause, we have
          not been too concerned about these results.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">At this point it was
          discovered that the process is a wattage-dependent reaction,
          and as the size of the sample varies, the reaction varies on
          an inverse lineal level wherein doubling the size of the
          sample would cut total reaction in half. Consistency became
          the biggest problem making it mandatory that from 1967 to
          1970, extensive research had to be conducted to determine what
          would be required to give consistency to the process.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Statistical evaluation
          performed in 1966-67 shows that an ore of no value could be
          handled to make an ore of value. In the Olsen report on the
          statistical evaluation, the ore used was taken from the
          tailings ponds of the United States Smelting and Refining
          Company. The ore, having no value to begin with, averaged
          after processing a mean value of 11.79 oz of gold per ton;
          giving estimates of 95% confidence interval for the mean, we
          get values of 9.22 and 14.66 oz of gold per ton. This means
          the ore has increased from approximately $1 a ton to more than
          $300 a ton in value [1970 values]. Consistency was achieved in
          1970 by adding to the process a control resonant chamber which
          acts to bring all variables into phase.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">There remained only one
          problem, that of consistency. That is, each time an ore was
          processed, the mean value would be larger than the standard
          deviation. This was accomplished by using a resonant chamber
          or, as we have called it, and "[magnetic] undulator", to bring
          the material into phase with the radiation source, or into a
          resonant relationship with the radiation source. There are
          definite peaks at which each ore, that is of value with this
          process, releases the metals found within it. There are peaks
          for each metal ion within the ore.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;The chart of tests run
          August 24 1970 to October 12, 1970 establishes consistency and
          make it possible to build a production facility. Tests run on
          August 24 were run under slightly separate conditions than the
          tests of September 17 through October 12 wherein after August
          24 there were changes in the power supply. This changed the
          total wattage delivered to the sample and also a slight change
          in the curve relationship of sample to the radiation source.
          Difficulties in obtaining the proper power supply are the
          results of engineering and not of the process, as the proper
          power supplies are available on the market.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Samples # 1, 2 ,3 and 4
          dated August 24 give a clear picture as they are a
          conglomerate of several samples run all at the same time,
          mixed together to as to give an average and then assayed to
          show the total overall value. For example, sample one
          consisted of two samples irradiated at the same tie and the
          same conditions, both weighing 60 grams, giving a total of 120
          grams. The samples are very sensitive to the wattage supplied.
          The function is not linear; minimum wattage required is 200
          watt-seconds per gram. Other conditions remained constant
          throughout the test.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When it becomes desirable to
          use this process on a new ore, the process has to be adjusted
          to the characteristics of that ore. The chemical formulas and
          the resonant energy levels must be established for each ore.
          To date, a sufficient number of ores have been evaluated to
          establish that a process can be adapted within reasonable
          limits.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Metals not otherwise
          detected are freed for a separation by normal separating
          processes. This process does not purport to be a separation
          system in any way in that upon completion of irradiation the
          samples will have to be delivered to a mill or smelter as per
          the most expedient means of disposing of the valuable ore.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The status of the project
          now stands at a point where further research will be of a
          duplicating nature. Engineering needs must be accomplished to
          bring this process into commercial production. The chemicals
          required are available on the open market. Electronic
          equipment for irradiation and also resonance control equipment
          are available, provided sufficient capital and lead time are
          allowed to obtain said equipment. The Research Institute has
          demonstrated that tailings or low grade ore of no apparent
          value can be bombarded by high energy particles under ideal
          conditions, resulting in the freeing of metals not otherwise
          detectable that can now be separated by a normal separating
          process.</font> </p>

          take approximately 12 months to complete, we have designated
          the first year as 18 months (12 months to complete the plant,
          and 6 months of operation). If we operate the plant for 4,000
          hours, total cost of operation the first year will amount to
          $6,361,444. However, estimating a minimum return within the
          95% confidence level, Y1 would give us 9.92 ounces per ton x 6
          tons/hour x 4,000 hours equals 238,000 ounces, giving more
          than a minimum return. The breakeven point would be at 283
          hours, giving a return of $6.4 million [1979 prices]; or, if
          one should calculate the breakeven point for the number of
          ounces through the years, you would find that we must recover
          at least 0.727 ounces per ton. We might see a minimum return
          could be calculated at one ounce per ton... In none of these

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The statistical report on
          the Research Institute's Recovery of Minerals from Low Grade
          Ore process by L.M. Olsen and Associates... may be difficult
          for the layman to understand. This paper explains some
          elementary statistical theory which may help to clarify the
          report and presents possible explanations of why the data
          behaves a it does. Prof. Olsen was consulted strictly in order
          to evaluate statistically the results obtained from a series
          of 62 tests conducted at Varian Associates on a rental linear
          accelerator.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Ordinarily, statistical data
          follows one of several typical distributions. These
          distributions start at a low value on the left, gradually
          climbing to a peak at the central point, and dropping
          gradually off to zero, or a low value again at the right when
          yield is plotted against number of tests as shown by the curve
          drawn in black (<a href="#stat2">Figure 2</a>). When there are
          a limited number of tests, data is usually grouped into
          intervals in order to get a good approximation of its
          distribution, i.e., the number of tests falling between zero
          and six are the first interval, six to twelve the next
          interval, etc. Any size interval which gives a good picture of
          the distribution can be chosen. The intervals are then charted
          and a smooth curve is drawn through them. If an infinite
          number of tests were available, the curve would smooth out to
          the typical curve shown in <a href="#stat2">Figure 2</a> as
          the interval chosen could then be very small. Normally, the
          data is divided into something less than 20 intervals unless
          an enormous number of test results are available...</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The data from these tests at
          the rental facility, did not fit a typical distribution but
          followed approximately a negative exponential curve when
          plotted in the standard way (<a href="#stat1">Figure 1</a>).
          The largest number of results fell in the first interval with
          a smaller number of results in each succeeding interval until
          the seventh where the number of results falls to zero. Then
          there are the three very high results as explained in Prof.
          Olsen's report.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It must be pointed out at
          this point that normally, when statistical tests to determine
          an estimated mean are conducted, test conditions are held as
          constant as possible in order that only the variation inherent
          in the process can be studied. This was not done in this case.
          These results include the first tests conducted on a Varian
          particle accelerator and, since each machine appears to affect
          the yield differently, a wide variety of test conditions were
          checked to find optimum yield conditions. It would be much
          better to check a number of samples at constant optimum test
          conditions and use these to calculate an expected production
          mean. However, these tests are expensive on a rental facility
          and an attempt has been made to use only the minimum number
          necessary. The assumption has been made that the expected
          yield which could be predicted would be higher if a number of
          tests at optimum conditions were conducted. Therefore the
          minimum predicted from thse tests at the rental facility
          should be an absolute minimum.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This process seems to have a
          high tendency to either yield a fairly average result or
          nearly nothing, i.e., if the settings and conditions of the
          test are in a range favorable to the process, a fair yield is
          obtained, but if conditions are set up in an unfavorable
          manner, a yield of near zero is obtained. Unfavorable
          conditions do not merely drop the yield somewhat as in some
          processes, but drop the results right to the bottom. A yield
          of 0.04 or 0.06 is about as low as the results ever drop with
          the ore used in these tests and this low was hit a few times.
          Since the testing was conducted at a wide variety of
          conditions, it was natural to hit some of these unfavorable
          conditions now and then. The fact that this happened can be
          witnessed by observing the test results in the first interval
          (0 to 6). Of the 22 tests falling into this interval, 10 are
          from 0 to 1 while the other 12 are between 1 and 6. If a
          separate class of from 0 to 1 could be included, or if these
          results from 0 to 1 were found not to be present in a series
          of tests conducted at optimum conditions, it can be seen that
          the data would follow approximately a typical distribution
          curve except for the three outliers. The three outliers are
          also common in this process. Many times during testing of this
          process, unusually high results have been seen on an
          individual test. This happens many more times than would be
          predicted statistically from the averages of the other tests.
          So far the reason for these unusually high results and the
          method of reproducing them consistently has not been isolated.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As stated in Prof. Olsen's
          report, the 95% confidence interval for the mean is from 9.22
          to 14.36. This means that the average yield for a production
          pant has a 95% chance of lying between these two values. The
          average yield has a 2.5% chance of lying below 9.22 ounces per
          ton. Therefore, the average yield has a 97.5% chance of lying
          above 9.22 ounces of gold per ton.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Ignoring the three very high
          results and spreading the zero results out over the
          distribution as would be likely to occur in a series of tests
          at constant optimum conditions, a typical distribution curve
          would be approached. This projected curve is sketched in <a
            href="#stat3">Figure 3</a>. It is believed that this
          projected curve would be approached in a production operation
          where conditions are constant and enough tests are conducted
          to allow the curve to stabilize. The negative exponential
          curve of Figure 1 with the large number of zero and low
          results is what is expected during startup and while searching
          for optimum conditions. If the projected curve of <a
            href="#stat3">Figure 3</a> is the true curve for this
          process, which seems quite likely, it would show that a yield
          of around 10.5 ounces of gold per ton would be the lower limit
          of the 99% confidence level. No attempt has been made to
          include the yields of silver in these calculations, but it has
          been noticed that the silver content in these samples usually
          runs about 1/3 as many ounces per ton as the gold content,
          although the variation of this proportion is fairly wide.</font>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This invention relates to
          electrotherapeutic apparatus, and to methods of applying
          electrical, radioactive, and other radiant phenomena
          therapeutically.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The invention is primarily
          concerned with the use of high potential, high frequency
          electricity though not necessarily limited thereto, in
          conjunction with radioactive and other types of electronic and
          radiation phenomena, for therapeutic purposes.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Among the objects of the
          invention are the following:</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(1) To render highly
          effective, from a therapeutic standpoint, radioactive and
          other types of electronic and radiation phenomena, and
          likewise, to render highly effective, from a therapeutic
          standpoint, high potential, high frequency electricity.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(2) To augment the
          therapeutic effect of radioactive and other types of
          electronic and radiation phenomena by the conjoint use of high
          potential, high frequency electricity, and conversely, to
          augment the therapeutic effect of high frequency, high
          potential electricity by the conjoint use of radioactive and
          other types of electronic and radiation phenomena.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(3) To accomplish the above
          without danger of burning or otherwise harming the patient.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(4) To provide apparatus for
          accomplishing the above, which is relatively simple in
          construction and operation and relatively inexpensive to
          produce and operate.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(5) To provide novel
          electronic and radioactive devices especially adapted for use
          in conjunction with high potential, high frequency electrical
          therapy.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">I have found that, be
          enveloping a patient in a high potential, high frequency field
          in such a manner that no closed circuit is completed through
          his body, radioactive and other electronic and radiation
          phenomena can be used therapeutically with considerably
          greater effectiveness than if used alone. The exact reason for
          this is not known, nor is it known definitely which, the
          electric field or the radioactive phenomena, acts upon the
          other to produce the advantageous results. It is thought,
          however, that the electric field permeating the body of the
          patient as it does attracts the radioactive emanations or
          radiations and enables them to penetrate considerably deeper
          into the tissues and vital organs of the patient than would
          otherwise be the case. In any event, remarkable therapeutic
          results have been achieved by use of the invention in the
          treatment of malignant tumors. Arthritis, sinus infections,
          and various other diseased conditions.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The invention contemplates
          the use, in therapeutics, of high potential, high frequency
          electricity to produce diversified forms of radiant energy,
          such forms being those which have been found best suited,
          individually, to benefit various human ailments. In
          accomplishing this purpose, several special discharge tubes
          have been developed to serve as treatment electrodes, by means
          of which correspondingly different curative results are
          obtained. Throughout the practice of the invention a prime
          consideration is that only one terminal of any particular
          circuit shall be contact with the patient's body at one time,
          so there will be no flow of current through a closed circuit
          of which the patient's body is a part. Such a terminal, too,
          is usually non-heat producing, so there is no danger of
          burning. In cases where there is a tendency for a tube to
          produce x-rays or other injurious rays, these are filtered
          out.</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In accordance with the
          invention, provision is made for enveloping the patient in a
          high potential and, in certain instances, a high frequency
          electric field, and for applying to the patient, while so
          enveloped in the electric field, radiations and emanations
          having therapeutic value.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The apparatus of Figure 1 is
          capable of administering specific kinds of treatment, pursuant
          to the invention, at the several treatment stations provided.
          The treatment stations are indicated A, B, C, D, and E,
          respectively.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">For supplying the high
          potential electric field, a suitable transformer is employed.
          This may be of any type capable of delivering high potential
          electricity, say from 10,000 to 30,000 volts. It is preferred,
          however, to utilize a conventional double magnetic circuit
          type of transformer, indicated at 10 in Figure 1, having
          adjustable laminated magnetic shunts (not shown), the
          transformer being connected across an ordinary power line 11
          charged with the customary 115 volts. The output lines 12 from
          this transformer advantageously extend to the treatment
          stations A and B, respectively. The first secondary of the
          transformer 10 is preferably direct connected to the second
          secondary thereof. It is noted that this high potential
          electricity may be applied, without causing injury, direct to
          a patient who is not grounded. However, in order to safeguard
          the transformer 10 from damage by sparking across its output
          terminals, and to render the high potential electricity more
          suitable for therapeutic purposes, which is believed to
          include the automatic changing of frequency to an extent which
          depends upon the electrical characteristics of the patient's
          body, a governor or control device 14 is shunted across the
          leads 12.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This governor or control
          device 14 is a sparking condenser of high capacity embodying a
          multitude of spark gaps. A preferred embodiment of this
          governor or control device 14 is illustrated in detail in
          Figures 2 and 3.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As illustrated, the device
          comprises a cylindrical, electrically conductive plate 16
          surrounded by a cylindrical dielectric 16. An outer
          cylindrical and electrically conductive elements 17 surrounds
          the dielectric 16 exteriorly. It is provided with a multitude
          (for example, 250) of inwardly extending prongs 17a, which are
          advantageously formed by stamping out and inturning triangular
          portions of the electrically conductive element 17. The
          internal plate 15 preferably contacts the interior surface of
          the dielectric 16, but in any event should lie closely
          adjacent thereto. Likewise, the tips of the prongs 17a
          preferably contact the outer surface of the dielectric. The
          several elements are advantageously mounted in a plug-in base
          14a, which is adapted to mate with a suitable receiving socket
          (not shown) carrying the required electrical connections. He
          internal plate 15 connects with one of the electric lines 12,
          while the external element 17 connects with the other electric
          line 12, as shown diagrammatically in Figure 1.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It is preferable that the
          dielectric 16 be in the form of a closed tube or envelope, as
          shown, and be exhausted to vacuum condition. The multitude of
          sparking prongs 17a produce a brush discharge.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Where the dielectric 16 is
          not a closed tube or envelope, it is preferred that it be of
          quartz.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The treatment station A is a
          discharge tube of a novel type, exemplified by the tubes
          illustrated in detail in Figures 4, 5, 6, and 7. Either tube
          is plugged into the circuit of Figure 1 at a suitably provided
          single-terminal outlet. High potential electricity is,
          therefore, fed directly into the tube, which serves as an
          electrode. The tube also embodies radioactive material, which
          supplies radioactive emanations to the patient simultaneously
          with the electrical discharge.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As illustrated in Figures 4
          and 5 the tube or electrode ay comprise an electrically
          conductive discharge element 20, having a support stem 20a and
          a major discharge cap or head 20b, which is preferably in the
          form of a thin, convex-concave plate. The head 20b may be spot
          welded to the end of the stem 20a.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The discharge element 20 is
          enclosed within a tube 21 of dielectric material, preferably
          glass, the stem 20a being fixed in the fused tongue portion
          21a of the tube. The tube or shell 21 is fitted into an
          insulating base 22, provided with a single plug-in terminal
          23, and an electrical connector 24 extends from the terminal
          23 to the stem 20a.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The inside surfaces of the
          side walls of the tube or shell 21 are coated with a
          radioactive material, as at 25. The coating is conveniently
          made from uranium salts or powdered carnotite or other
          radioactive ore. The ends of the tube or shell are left
          uncoated.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Air is evacuated from the
          tube 21, and a small quantity of mercury introduced. The
          mercury is preferably triple-distilled to insure great purity.
          It is preferred that argon or like inert gas be also
          introduced.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Since the tube just
          described is plugged into the circuit of Figure 1, the
          discharge element or cathode 20 is charged with high potential
          electricity, and in its capacity of a treatment station in the
          apparatus of Figure 1, serves as an electrode to similarly
          charge the patient. The patient is insulated from the ground,
          and the tube is applied directly to the afflicted part of his
          body, preferably in close contact with the body.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Because of the construction
          of the tube, radiation of a radioactive nature is also
          directed against the patient through the uncoated top end of
          the tube. This radiation has been found to differ somewhat
          from the radioactive emanations discharging from the side
          walls of the tube, and is thought to comprise rays lying close
          to x-rays on the radiation spectrum. These rays appear to have
          a definite healing value, and lack the injurious nature of
          x-rays. Where a predominantly radioactive emanation treatment
          is desired, the side walls of the tube are placed against the
          body of the patient.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Best results are obtained
          when the discharge elements or cathode 20 is made of an alloy
          metal compounded from copper, lead, sulfur, and if desired,
          aluminum. The relative percentages of the several ingredients
          may vary considerably, but a satisfactory mixture comprises 5%
          copper, 55% lead, 30% sulfur, and 10% aluminum. Should
          aluminum not be used, the difference may be made up by
          additional copper.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In preparing the alloy, the
          copper and aluminum are heated to a molten state, after which
          the sulfur is added while stirring the mixture. After cooling,
          the mass is again melted, and the lead, in a molten state, is
          mixed with it, the molten mass being thoroughly stirred. This
          new mass is then cooled, being later reheated, and while hot,
          roiled to make it ductile so it can be shaped into the desired
          forms.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The discharge tube or
          electrode of Figures 6 and 7 is similar to that of Figures 4
          and 5, having an enclosing tube or shell 26 which is
          evacuated. A cathode discharge element 27 is positioned within
          the shell, being fixed in the tongue portion 26a. A conductor
          28 connects the stem 27a of the element 27 with a plug-in
          terminal 29, which extends outwardly of the base 30. The cap
          or head 27b of the element 27 differs from the cap or head of
          the electrode of Figures 4 and 5, in that it is spherical in
          form and hollow. It has an opening 31 formed at its top,
          contiguous with the top inside surface of the tube 26. A
          quantity 32 of radioactive material, which may be the same as
          used for the coating 25 of the electrode of Figures 4 and 5,
          is introduced into the tube or shell 26, along with a
          relatively small quantity of mercury, before the tube is
          sealed tight. Such material is preferably powdered or
          granulated, and is shaken into the hollow of the head 27b
          through the opening 31 before any given treatment is
          commenced. The mercury is provided primarily as a getter, and
          does no harm if shaken into the head 27b along with the
          radioactive substance. The mercury also tends to produce a
          vapor in the tube, which aids in the operation thereof. As in
          the case of the electrode tube of Figures 4 and 5, this tube
          may have a radioactive coating 33 covering the inner surfaces
          of its side walls.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The treatment station B of
          Figure 1 differs from the treatment station A only in the fact
          that a condenser 34 is interposed in the electric supply line
          12.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The treatment station C of
          Figure 1 differs from the stations A and B only in the fact
          that the high potential electricity is supplied from the
          supply line 12 through an inductance 35.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The treatment station D
          utilizes a germicidal discharge tube, a preferred form of
          which is illustrated in detail in Figures 8, 9, and 10. The
          high potential electricity is taken by induction from the
          particular supply line 12 concerned. For this purpose, an
          induction coil 36 is provided, tapping the line 12 at 37. A
          pair of leads 38 from an ordinary 115 volt supply source
          extend to a plug-in socket connection for the germicidal tube,
          one of the leads passing through a glass tube 36a in Figure 1,
          which is disposed within and extends along the length of the
          induction coil 36. Thus, high potential electricity is
          impressed, by induction, upon the ordinary current flowing
          through the particular lead 38 concerned.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The germicidal discharge
          tube of Figures 8, 9, and 10 has a pair of discharge terminals
          40 and 41, respectively, positioned in an evacuated tube or
          envelope 42, and electrically connected with plug-in terminals
          40-l and 41-l, respectively, by means of stems 40a and 41a,
          respectively. The tube or envelope 42 and plug-in terminals
          are mounted in a conventional base 43. It is preferred that
          insulating material 44, such as a ceramic sleeve, covers the
          major portions of the stems 40a and 41a. A piece of lithium
          metal 45, see particularly Figure 10, is advantageously
          secured to the stem 40a adjacent the discharge terminal 40 to
          act as a getter. It may, however, be placed at any other
          convenient location in the tube. It is preferred that the
          discharge terminals 40 and 41 be formed of the special alloy
          previously described. Argon or other suitable inert gas is
          preferably injected into the tube or envelope 42, as is also a
          small quantity of mercury. The mercury, by vaporizing, aids
          electrical arcing between the discharge terminals. As will be
          noted, the high potential electricity induced in the one lead
          38 will manifest at the upper discharge terminal 40, and will
          charge the patient&nbsp; simultaneously with the discharge
          into his body of germicidal rays from the tube.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The treatment station E
          embodies the tube of Figures 8, 9, and 10, as described above,
          but impresses the high potential electricity directly on the
          patient instead of passing it first through the tube. For this
          purpose, a discharge device 50, in the form of a soft,
          flexible pad in which a coil 50-1 is embedded, taps one of the
          high potential electric lines 12. This pad 50 is wrapped
          around the patient's body adjacent the afflicted portion
          thereof, thus charging the patient. Any other high potential
          electricity may be used in place of the pad 50. The germicidal
          tube has its terminals 40-1 and 41-1 plugged into a suitable
          plug-in socket connected to leads 52 which extend to an
          ordinary 115 volt source of supply. The high potential
          electricity with which the patient is charged is induced into
          the germicidal tube, thereby further activating the discharge
          therefrom. A certain beneficial discharge from this type of
          germicidal tube will be had by induced activation alone, it
          being unnecessary, in such instances, to plug the tube into
          the 115 volt line.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Other types of germicidal
          and discharge tubes may be sued in place of the tube of
          Figures 8, 9, and 10, as for instance the well known infrared
          and ultraviolet lamps, to produce results surpassing those
          ordinarily attained by the use of such lamps apart from the
          apparatus of the invention.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It should be remembered that
          the patient is insulated from the ground while being treated
          at any of the treatment stations of the invention.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Figures 1 and 12 show how a
          patient is treated pursuant to the invention, while immersed
          in an electrically conductive fluid bath. In Figure 11, a bath
          tub 53 is insulated from the ground by a layer of insulation
          54. A treatment electrode of the type shown in any of the
          figure groups 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 is positioned to charge
          the fluid of the bath with high potential electricity, as well
          as to discharge healing radiations and emanations into the
          patient. The particular electrode illustrated is diagrammatic
          in form and is designated 55. It may be connected into the
          circuit of Figure 1 as shown at any of the treatment stations
          A, B, C, and D. In Figure 12, a shower or vapor stall 56 is
          insulated from the ground by a layer of insulation 57. A
          plurality of treatment electrodes are designated 58. These
          correspond to the treatment electrode 55 of Figure 11. A water
          spray or vapor, such as steam, may be admitted to the stall 56
          in any well known manner (not shown), thus enveloping the
          patient during treatment.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Another embodiment of
          apparatus, pursuant to the invention, is illustrated
          diagrammatically by the wiring diagram of Figure 13. While no
          treatment stations are shown, those provided are identical
          with the several treatment stations designated A, B, C, D, and
          E I Figure 1. The distinction in this embodiment of apparatus
          resides in the fact that a special generator of high frequency
          electricity is provided in the system.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A transformer 60 has its
          input terminals connected across an ordinary 115 volt electric
          line 61. Electrical conductors 62 and 63 lead from the
          respective output terminals of the transformer to a high
          frequency generator of the Oudin coil type, indicated
          generally at 64, a variable condenser 65 being interposed in
          the line 62, and the circuit being grounded at 66. Output
          conductors 67 and 68, leading from the high frequency
          generator 64, provide connection for the several treatment
          stations in the same manner as illustrated in Figure 1.</font>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In the illustrated instance,
          the governor or control device 69 preferably takes the form of
          a vacuum tube, having the constructi9on shown by Figures 14,
          15, 16, 17, 18 or 19. These tubes all possess high capacity
          and include elements effecting a brush discharge. They serve
          as does the device 14 of Figures 2 and 3.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The tube of Figures 14 and
          15 embodies an outer shell or envelope 70 of insulating
          material such as glass, a plastic, or fiber coated with
          shellac. Inside the shell 70 is a bi-cylindrical element 71
          formed of electrically conductive material. Separating element
          71 from the enclosing shell 70 are spacers 72 made of rubber,
          bakelite, or other insulating material. Inter-fitting with the
          element 71 is a second electrically conductive, bi-cylindrical
          element 73, the two elements being separated by a dielectric
          74. Inwardly of the element 73, and separated therefrom by a
          dielectric 75, is a corrugated, cylindrical element 76. The
          shell or envelope 70 is secured in an insulating base 70-1,
          provided with plug-in terminals. One of the terminals,
          designated 77, is electrically connected with the element 71,
          while another, designated 78, is electrically connected with
          the corrugated element 76. These two terminals connect with
          the conductors 62 and 63, as illustrated in Figure 13, and the
          brush discharge takes place at element 76.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Under certain circumstances,
          it is desirable that the outer shell 70 be made of quartz
          glass, and that a filament 79 be provided, the filament being
          heated by connection through plug-in terminals 80 and 81 with
          a source of low voltage heating current (not shown). Plug-in
          terminal 82, which is electrically connected with element 73,
          may be used instead of or in connection with the terminal 77,
          since element 73 acts in a manner similar to element 71. A
          getter 83 of suitable material, and an insulating an
          reflecting shield 84 may be provided, as shown. While the tube
          may have either a high or a low vacuum condition, or may be
          filled with an inert gas, I have also found it advantageous to
          fill the tube with a moist vapor. The tube acts as an
          oscillator for electric currents, and has an enormous
          capacity, a capacity many times that of a condenser of
          approximately equal size.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The tube of Figures 16 and
          17 comprises an outer shell or envelope 85 which may be made
          of metal, glass, or fused quartz. This shell is mounted in an
          insulating base 86. Inside the shell 85 is a metal plate 87,
          and spaced apart therefrom, a corrugated metal plate 88. A
          plug-in terminal 89, which extends from the base, is
          electrically connected with the corrugated plate 88. These
          terminals are adapted to connect, through a suitable socket,
          with the electrical conductors 62 and 63 of Figure 13.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Under certain circumstances
          of use, it is desirable to have other elements in the tube.
          These are provided, and may be utilized or not as occasion
          warrants. A filament 91 is disposed between the plates 87 an
          88. It is electrically connected with the two plug-in
          terminals 92 and 93, which are adapted to be connected to a
          source of low voltage heating current (not shown). A slit
          screen, comprising shields 94 and 95, with apertures 96
          extending therethrough, is disposed adjacent that side of
          corrugated plate 88 which is remote from plate 87. The
          apertures 96 are in alignment with each other, and the shields
          94 and 95 are made of lead or other material capable of
          screening off x-rays. Between shields 94 and 95 is a sheet 97
          of material which is readily permeable to x-rays. Within the
          shell 85 there is also mounted a shell or envelope 98 of
          glass, quartz glass, or similar material, having a portion 98a
          which is ground like a lens and directed toward the slit
          screen. This shell 98 really constitutes a tube within a tube.
          A filament or cathode 99, comprising electrically conductive
          legs 99a and 99b and an electron-emitting portion 99c, is
          disposed within the shell 98, plug-in terminals 100 and 101
          being electrically connected to the respective legs 99a and
          99b. A bombardment element 102 is disposed within the shell 98
          opposite the portion 99c of cathode 99. Within the shell 85,
          but outside the shell 98, is a reflector 103 directed toward
          the slit screen.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The tube of Figures 18 and
          19 is essentially the same as the tube of Figures 16 and 17,
          being equipped with a shell or envelope 105, a base 106, a
          plate 107, and a corrugated plate 108, the two plates being
          connected to plug-in terminals 109 and 110 respectively, which
          are adapted to connect electrically with the conductors 62 and
          63 of Figure 13. There is a filament 111 and an inner shell or
          envelope 112, but no slit screen. Instead of a lens portion
          being provided on the inner shell 112, a partition 113 of lens
          formation is disposed between the inner shell and the
          corrugated plate 108. It is fused to the walls of the outer
          shell 105.&nbsp; Within the inner shell 112 is a filament or
          cathode 114 which corresponds to the similar element 99 of the
          tube of Figures 16 and 17. A reflector 115 is directed toward
          the lens partition 113.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Reverting now to Figure 1,
          there is another advantageous way of treating a patient
          pursuant to the invention. As shown at Y, a foot pedestal 120
          may be provided for making the patient a part of the
          condenser. The pedestal comprises an electrically conductive
          plate element or electrode 121, connected electrically with
          one of the high potential lines 12, and covered by an
          insulating platform 122 upon which the patient rests his feet
          while being treated at any of the previously described
          treatment stations A, B, C, D, or E. The electrode 121 and
          insulating platform 122 are conveniently mounted in a frame
          123, which insulates the plate from the ground. The insulating
          platform 122 is made of a high quality insulating material
          such as first grade hard rubber. In certain instances it is
          desirable that the device be made in other than foot-pedestal
          form. For instance, it may be of cylindrical formation for use
          in a bed against any part of the patient's body.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">If desired, the patient may
          be charged with the high potential electricity by direct
          contact with a metal or electrically conductive electrode in
          place of the pad 50 or treatment station E, or of the tube
          electrodes.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The invention has been
          described in the foregoing with sole reference to its use for
          therapeutic purposes. It should be noted, however, that
          inorganic matter may also be treated to advantage pursuant to
          the method and with the apparatus of the invention. It has
          been found that metals, for example lead, have changed
          physical properties after treatment in accordance with the
          above. In instances where the invention is not being used
          therapeutically, it is not always necessary to insulate the
          subject from the ground.</font> </p>
