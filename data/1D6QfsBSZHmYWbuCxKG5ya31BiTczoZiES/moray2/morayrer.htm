      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><b>RADIANT ENERGY</b> ---
          The
          term
          Moray has used to describe that source of energy coming from
          the cosmos
          to earth and radiating from the earth back from whence it
          came. This is
          the energy the Moray device captures and could be described as
          those
          particles
          of energy pervading all space. In the evolution of energy and
          the
          evolution
          of matter these particles of matter and energy (one and the
          same)
          manifest
          under certain conditions as pure energy and under others as
          pure
          matter.
          Radiant Energy from the cosmos, like radiant particles of
          matter, being
          composed of an infinitesimal quantity whose behaviors are
          described by
          mathematical equations similar to those used for describing
          electrical
          waves, keeping in mind to differentiate between wavelength and
          frequency.
          Radiant Energy is particles of energy, just as light is
          wavelengths and
          particles are comparable to the electron and magneton: a ring
          of
          negative
          electricity traveling in a vortex with the speed of light,
          streams of
          energy
          quanta, each quantum having energy and momentum where the
          electron
          revolves
          around the proton at a distance equal to the electron radius.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">To summarize: Radiant Energy
          as
          herein
          used is that energy existing in the luminiferous medium of the
          universe,
          kinetic and exercised in wave transmission and rendered
          sensible by
          conversion
          of its energy into a detectable frequency. In the final
          analysis,
          Radiant
          Energy is a means of using the energy released by the
          fissionable
          reactions
          taking place in the stellar crucibles of the universe.</font>

          experiments
          with the taking of electricity from the ground, as I termed
          it, during
          the summer of 1909. By fall of 1910 I had sufficient power to
          operate a
          small electrical device, and I made a demonstration of my idea
          to two
          friends...
          This demonstration in the early stages consisted of operating
          a
          miniature
          arc light... It soon became evident that the energy was not
          static and
          that the static of the universe would be of no assistance to
          me in
          obtaining
          the power I was seeking...</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">During the Christmas
          Holidays
          of
          1911, I began to fully realize that the energy I was working
          with was
          not
          of a static nature, but of an oscillating nature. Further I
          realized
          that
          the energy was not coming out of the earth, but instead was
          coming to
          the
          earth from some outside source. These electrical oscillations
          in the
          form
          of waves were not simple oscillations, but were surgings ---
          like the
          waves
          of the sea --- coming to the earth continually, more in the
          daytime
          than
          at night, but always coming in vibrations from the reservoir
          of
          colossal
          energy out there in space. By this time I was able to obtain
          enough
          power
          to light the old 16-candlepower carbon lamp for about one half
          capacity,
          and I did not seem to make any further improvement until the
          spring of
          1925."</font> </p>

          Saints,
          and
          under a visitor's visa was allowed to enter Sweden during the
          Exhibition
          of 1912 in Stockholm...</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In his notebook, dated
          November
          1,
          1913, Henry included a memo that he had obtained material from
          a
          railroad
          car at Abisco, Sweden the previous summer, and material from
          the side
          of
          a hill. He made electric tests of these materials, taking them
          home to
          try each as a detector for his energy machine. Tests indicated
          that

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">[p. 31] Henry Moray
          demonstrated
          that energy was available by its actions on a resistive load,
          such as a
          flat-iron or a space heater, and by lighting lights. A
          resistive load
          is
          directly proportional to the amount of energy delivered to it.
          In
          heating
          a heater or lighting a light, the number of watts produced can
          be
          calculated
          as equal to the number of watts consumed. This energy is fed
          into a
          load
          to give either heat/light, or power. A motor can be operated
          but must
          be
          designed for high frequency. The Radiant Energy device
          operation is
          shown
          in Figure 54, in which he used an antenna and a ground
          connected to his
          solid state RE device...</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">He was able to show that
          none
          of
          the energy came from within his device. Internally the device
          was
          electrically
          dead when it had not been connected and tuned to the antenna.
          When his
          device was set up, he could connect it to an antenna and
          ground, and by
          priming it first and then tuning it as he primed it, the
          device would
          draw
          electrical energy. This high frequency electrical energy
          produced up to
          250,000 volts and it lighted a brighter light than witnesses
          had ever
          before
          seen. Heavy loads could be connected to the device without
          dimming the
          lights that were already connected to it. This device worked
          many miles
          from any known source of electrical energy. Such as
          transmission lines
          or radio. The device produced up to 50,000 watts of power and
          worked
          for
          long periods of time....</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">He assumed at first that
          this
          energy
          was electromagnetic in origin; however, he never claimed that
          it was
          electromagnetic
          in nature. He assumed at first that this energy came from the
          earth.
          But
          later he believed it was from the universe. Finally he began
          to believe
          that it was present throughout all space, intermolecular space
          as well
          as terrestrial and celestial space. He did not necessarily
          understand
          how
          his detectors operated, only that if he very carefully built
          the device
          according to his calculations, it worked. He was able to
          demonstrate
          the
          existence of an energy that today, though it has not been
          identified or
          proven, has been theorized by many researchers...</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">[p. 32] As early as 1904,
          Nicola
          Tesla, experimenting with AC currents of high potential and
          high
          frequency,
          said: "Ere many generations pass, our machinery will be driven
          by a
          power
          obtainable at any point in the universe... Throughout space
          there is
          energy.
          Is this energy static or kinetic? If static, our hopes are in
          vain; if
          kinetic --- and this we know it is for certain --- then it is
          a mere
          question

          Moray
          Radiant
          Device":</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The largest instrument being
          about
          6 inches high and circular in shape and about 8 inches in
          diameter...
          We
          went out on the roof of the chicken coop carrying the device
          on a small
          drafting board, erected an antenna upon the roof of the coop,
          the
          antenna
          being about 100 feet from the house. We pulled the main line
          switches
          in
          the house before going out upon the roof. Mr Judd had me move
          the
          drafting
          board from place to place and I also had him examine the
          inside of the
          coop for hidden equipment. I then put the machine together in
          his
          presence
          and the device was then started. Mr Judd timed me to see how
          long it
          would
          take to bring in the light. I was able to light-watt type CGE
          lamp to
          full
          capacity and also to heat to the sizzling point an old style
          Hotpoint
          electric
          flat iron which consumed 655 watts. Mr Judd asked me to take
          off the
          antenna.
          The light went out. It was connected again and the light
          reappeared. We
          drove a new ground at a spot selected by Mr Judd, made a

          he suggested that the wire be stretched tighter to prevent so
          much sag
          at the center. This was done and the wire then appeared to

          after being driven down about 5 feet the second section, which
          was

          down
          until it struck a hard object... I judge about 7 feet of pipe

          holes
          in both ends. A piece of wire about 2 feet long connected each
          insulator
          with the pole. The lead-in wire was fastened to the antenna

          of
          a butter box, another unpainted box slightly smaller, a fiber
          board box
          about 6" x 4" x 4", which Mr Moray referred to as containing
          the tubes.

          appeared to
          be
          a magnet at one end, a switch near the middle and a receptacle
          for an
          electric
          light globe at the other end. There were also several posts
          for
          connecting

          Before
          tuning in he placed the key on the post: he said it would be
          in contact
          with while the light burns but no light appeared. The tuning
          in
          consisted
          of stroking the end of a magnet across two metal projections
          protruding
          from what I referred to above as being a magnet. After tuning
          in for
          slightly
          more than 10 minutes the key was put on the operating post and
          the
          light
          appeared immediately... Mr Moray put the key on the operating
          post two
          or three times before during the tuning in operation but no
          light
          appeared...
          We allowed the light to burn for 15 minutes..... The
          brilliancy of the
          light, a 100-watt globe... was about 75% as bright as a
          100-watt globe
          connected to an ordinary house socket in my opinion. It was an
          even
          light,
          without fluctuations of any kind.</font> </p>

          also
          disconnected
          the ground wire and the light went out. He then connected it

        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">Below is a report of my
          observation
          of the Moray cosmic energy device.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The aerial used is about 200
          feet
          long and is about 80 feet above the ground: the wire is a
          copper cable
          approximately a fourth inch in diameter, and well insulated.
          The ground
          is the water pipe in the basement of Dr Moray's home.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The device was assembled in
          a
          trunk
          through the sides of which were holes for the connections to
          ground and
          to the antenna and for observation; the said holes were about
          one-half
          inch in diameter. There were two boxes about 10 by 20 by 4
          inches, one
          on top of the other; both were closed and the covers fastened
          with
          screws.
          On the upper box was lying an insulating panel about an inch
          thick by
          15
          inches long and 3 inches wide; it is of slate or hard rubber
          or some
          material
          of similar appearance. On this were two binding posts that
          were
          connectible
          by means of a small switch; also mounted on this panel is a
          body about
          2-1/2-inches square, wrapped in friction tape, from which
          protrude two
          poles about 1/4-inch in diameter, apparently of sift iron. A
          double
          receptacle
          for light globes was connected in the circuit. In one of which
          was a
          20-watt
          globe, and in the other a 100 watt globe...</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Dr Moray then took a magnet,
          which
          was a very broad, short limbed U, and began to stroke one pole
          of it on
          the poles in the taped body: Mr Jensen placed his fingers on
          the
          binding
          posts several times, and at last received a rather vigorous
          shock; Mr
          Moray
          then threw the switch and the globes lighted...</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As a further proof that the
          conversion
          of the energy was due to the mechanism in the box, Dr Moray
          hit the
          table
          on which the trunk was standing, a moderate blow with a hammer
          whereupon
          the light flickered and went off, due to the detector being
          shaken out
          of adjustment.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The boxes in which the
          mechanism
          had been hosed during the test were opened and the contents
          examined;
          there
          were condensers, the detector, a transformer, and two tubes in
          them but
          nothing else. Nothing that in the least resembled a battery.</font>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It is to be noted that after
          a
          total
          run of 158 hours the device supplied 635 watts; inasmuch as a
          horsepower
          is but 746 watts this equals 0.878 of a horsepower or slightly
          more
          than
          7/8 horsepower. This alone is sufficient to dispose of any
          suggestion
          of
          a battery...</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">[p. 54] To All Whom It May
          Concern
          (June 25, 1929): It is now more than 2 years since I first
          became
          acquainted
          with Dr T. H. Moray and the work he is carrying on, and in tat
          time he
          has demonstrated inventive ability of an exceptional order.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Perhaps the most wonderful
          of
          his
          inventions is a device whereby he is able to draw electric
          power from
          an
          antenna. This energy is not derived by induction from power
          lines, as
          has
          been suggested by some, nor is it derived from radio stations,
          as has
          been
          demonstrated by taking the apparatus more than 26 miles from
          the
          nearest
          power line and over a hundred miles from the nearest radio
          station and
          showing that it operates just as well as anywhere else. This
          device was
          subjected to an endurance test in which it was operated
          continuously
          for
          a week, and at the end of that time a 100-watt lamp was
          lighted
          simultaneously
          with the heating of a 575 watt standard Hotpoint flat iron,
          making a
          total
          of 675 watts; it is very evident that no batteries could
          sustain such a
          drain as this.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">He has also invented a very
          sensitive
          sound detector whereby it is possible to hear conversations
          carried on
          in an ordinary tome of voice at a distance of several blocks.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">He has also worked out
          numerous
          radio
          hookups which eliminate many of the parts now considered
          necessary for
          good reception, yet there is no diminution in quality or
          volume; in
          fact,
          there is a notable elimination of interference from static
          when some of
          these are used.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">He has devised a means by
          which
          he
          is able to measure with some degree of accuracy the energy
          evolved
          during
          mental activity; that is, he gets definite, variable
          deflections of the
          needle of a sensitive galvanometer which appeared to be
          related to the
          vigor of mental activity.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">There are a great many other
          equally
          remarkable things that he has done, such as reducing old
          rubber from
          truck
          tires to the state of a viscous fluid which is readily
          vulcanizable
          without
          the addition of smoke sheet as is necessary with other
          processes; also
          a high frequency therapeutic device, and numerous other

          that time that I could not answer on account of my lack of
          knowledge,
          both
          of science and the detail construction of the machine of Dr
          Moray's
          that
          we were talking about. There was one thing in particular that
          you asked
          about and that I know I did not make clear in my answer, and
          that was
          in
          regard to the setup of the six 100-watt lamps. You asked if
          they were
          set
          up in multiple or series, and this question was especially
          brought up
          as
          we were referring to the very small wire, which a N. 50, which
          I stated
          was used in connection with the operation of said lamps. Since
          my
          return
          to Salt Lake, I have gone over this matter and find that the 6
          lamps
          are
          set up in parallel and the small wire is used as the current
          enters the
          tube prior to and connecting with the step-down transformer,
          this
          taking
          the terrific high voltage to the transformer. In other words,
          I am
          trying
          to say to you that this is a terrific high voltage, and we are
          using
          the
          word "terrific" because it has been demonstrated that this is
          an
          exceedingly
          high voltage because it will [jump] through an arc flash at
          least 6
          inches
          and in excess.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Another thing that you asked

          application
          was first filed in 1931. This application was rejected on a
          number of
          bases.
          First (Figure 17),&nbsp; "Because no means was provided for
          causing the
          cathode to emit an appreciable number of electrons, the
          current
          produced

          at which an appreciable number of electrons per second are

          words,
          it
          was not enough for Moray to demonstrate the effect of the
          energy
          source;
          he also had to identify it, which he could not do...</font> </p>

          after
          World

          rebuild a
          Radiant Energy Device, using the remaining bit of what was
          known as the
          "Swedish Stone". This material, which was the heart of his
          original RE
          detector, he had never been able to duplicate, and the
          shortage of this
          material limited the amount of power he could draw.
          Consequently, in
          the
          large unit, he developed a second detector that forced him
          into
          extensive
          research involving nuclear materials and radioactive
          reactions. He
          became

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The total energy involved in
          "cosmic"
          radiations is very large. The mechanism of its generation
          involves a
          basic
          relationship with the total structure and action of the
          universe. Today
          it is believed that cosmic radiation consists primarily of
          protons and
          some heavier nuclei. At times this cosmic energy packs a
          wallop of
          around
          100 quadrillion volts. Coming continuously with slight
          variations in
          time,
          the radiations have a uniformly directional isotropy.</font> </p>

          earth from all directions, although there may be a slight
          deflection of
          the weaker rays by the earth's magnetic field. There is every
          indication
          that our sun is not the source of any appreciable amount of
          this
          radiation.
          The origin, therefore, is from the universe as a whole. The
          total
          energy
          of cosmic radiation is more than the entire luminous output of
          all the
          stars and nebulae of the universe combined. Unlimited power is

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When a particle is
          electrified,
          what
          one must first observe is that a certain amount of energy has
          been
          spent;
          work has been done. The result is an electrified state of the
          particle.
          The process of electrifying a conductor is, therefore, the
          storing of
          energy
          in some way in or around the conductor in some medium. The
          work is
          spent
          in altering the state of the medium, and when the particle is
          discharged,
          the medium returns to its original state, and the store of
          energy is
          disengaged.
          Similarly, a supply of energy is required to maintain an
          electric
          current,
          and the phenomenon arising from the current are manifestations
          of the
          presence
          of this energy in the medium around the circuit. It used to be
          that an
          electrified particle or body was supposed to have something
          called
          "electricity"
          residing upon it which caused electrical phenomena. An
          electric current
          was regarded as a flow of electricity traveling along a wire
          (for
          example),
          and the energy which appeared at any part of a circuit (if
          considered
          at
          all) was supposed to have been conveyed along the wire by the
          current.
          But, the existence of induction and electromagnetic
          interactions
          between
          bodies situated at a distance from each other leads one to
          look upon
          the
          medium around the conductors as playing a very important part
          in the
          development
          of these electrical phenomena. In fact, it is the storehouse
          of the
          energy.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It is upon this basis that
          Maxwell
          founded his theory of electricity and magnetism, and
          determined the

          of the energy in the various parts of an electric field in
          terms of
          electric
          and magnetic forces*. The medium around an electrified body is
          charged
          with energy and not of an imaginary electric fluid distributed
          over the
          electrified body or conductor. When we speak of the charge of
          an
          electrified
          conductor we are referring to the charge of energy in the
          medium around
          it, and when we talk of the electric flow or current in the
          circuit we
          are referring to the only flow we know of, namely, the flow of
          energy

          of a conductor is spent on the medium and stored there,
          probably as
          energy
          of motion. To denote this we shall say that the medium around
          the
          conductor
          is polarized, this word being employed to denote that its
          state or some
          of its properties have been altered in some manner and to a

          extent

          polarization is in the opposite sense, the two being related,
          perhaps,
          like right-handed and left-handed twists or rotations.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Now consider the case of a
          body
          charged
          alternately, positively and negatively in rapid succession.
          The
          positive
          charge means a positive polarization of the medium, which
          begins at the
          conductor and travels out through space. When the body is
          discharged
          the
          medium is once more set free and resumes its former condition.
          The
          negative
          charge now induces a modification of the medium or
          polarization in the
          opposite sense. The result of alternate charges of opposite
          sign is
          that
          the medium at any point becomes polarized alternately in
          opposite
          directions,
          while waves of opposite polarizations are propagated through
          space,
          each
          carrying energy derived from the source or agent supplying the
          electrification.
          Here, then, we have a periodic disturbance of some king
          occurring at
          each
          point, accompanied by waves of energy traveling outwards from
          the
          conductor.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The phenomenon of
          interference
          leads
          to the conclusion that light is the result of periodic
          disturbances or
          vibrations of the medium, but as to the nature of these
          vibrations, as
          to the exact nature of the periodic changes or what it is that
          changes
          them, we possess no knowledge. We know that alternating
          electric
          charges
          are accompanied by corresponding changes of state or
          vibrations of the
          medium, and if the charge is varied periodically and with
          sufficient
          rapidity,
          we have a vibration at each point analogous to, perhaps
          identical with,
          that which occurs in the propagation of light --- a
          combination of wave
          and particle properties. This then is the electromagnetic
          theory of the
          luminous vibration.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In the older elastic-solid
          theory,
          the light vibrations were supposed to be actual oscillations
          of the
          elements
          or molecules of the medium about their positions of rest, such
          as takes
          place when waves of transverse disturbance are propagated
          through an
          elastic
          solid. Such limitation is unwarranted to some extent, but one
          cannot
          afford
          to entirely disregard the particle theory of light either. A
          combination
          of the theories has merit. We know that the change,
          disturbance,
          vibration,
          polarization, or whatever we wish to term it, is periodic and
          transverse
          to the direction of propagation. The electromagnetic theory
          teaches us
          nothing further as to its nature, but rather asserts that
          whatever the
          charge may be, it is the same in kind as that which occurs in
          the
          medium
          when the charge of an electrified body is altered or reversed.
          It
          reduces
          light and heat waves to the same category as waves of
          electrical
          polarization.
          The only quality of the later required to constitute the
          former is
          sufficient
          rapidity of alteration. These speculations were given the
          strongest
          confirmation
          by experiments of Prof. Hertz many years ago.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When a resilient substance
          is
          subjected
          to strain and then set free, one of two things may happen. The
          substance
          may slowly recover from the strain and gradually attain its
          natural
          state,
          or the elastic recoil may carry it past its position of
          equilibrium and
          cause it to execute a series of oscillations. Something of the
          same
          sort
          may also occur when an electrified capacitor is discharged. In
          ordinary
          language, there may be a continuous flow of electricity in one
          direction
          until the discharge is completed, or an oscillating discharge
          may
          occur.
          That is, the first flow may be succeeded by a backrush, as if
          the first
          discharge had overrun itself and something like recoil had set
          in. The
          capacitor thus becomes more or less charged again in the
          opposite
          sense,
          and a second discharge occurs, accompanied by a second

          phenomenon produced by the passage of electric charges through

          oscillate
          until
          the original pressure is used up. If the internal impedance is
          too
          great,
          there will be no oscillations, but it will merely slide back
          in a dead

          the wave actions of the universe, periods of oscillation can
          be made to
          come quicker and quicker until inertia asserts itself, thus
          lengthening
          out the time of final recovery. This is done by carrying the
          recoil
          beyond
          the natural oscillations and prolonging the vibrations by
          capturing the

          oscillatory,
          a harmonic pattern is initiated and the oscillations continue,

          infinitesimal
          constituents of the atom, one finds that matter does not exist
          at all

          certain
          that the apparent complexity of nature is due to our lack of
          knowledge.
          And, as the picture unfolds, it promises a marvelous

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">One of the most marvelous
          relationships
          that has ever been revealed in the entire science of physics
          is that
          between
          light and electricity and the existence of electronics in
          atoms of
          matter.
          Knowing what we do at the present time with regard to the
          structure of
          atoms, this relationship is not quite so surprising. However,
          considering
          the total absence of this knowledge about a half century ago,
          the
          discovery
          that light, and radiation in general, are vibratory phenomena
          was
          revolutionary.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Speaking of radiation,
          Radiant
          here
          means proceeding from a center in straight lines in every
          direction.
          Energy
          is internal and inherent. "Energy is defined as a condition of
          matter
          in
          virtue of which any definite portion may affect changes in any
          other
          definite
          portion". This was written in 1892, and discoveries since
          confirm it.
          Energy
          then is a state of matter, or rather, the result of a
          particular state
          or condition in which matter may be when any observed phase of
          energy
          appears.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In addition to possessing
          kinetic
          energy, the atom is capable of absorbing energy internally.
          This
          internal
          energy is associated with the configuration of the particles
          of which
          the
          atom is composed. Under ordinary conditions an atom is in what
          is known
          as a state of equilibrium in which there is neither a giving
          off nor
          absorbing
          of energy. But, the internal energy of the atom can be
          altered. When
          the
          internal energy of the atom exceeds that of its normal state
          it is said
          to be excited. Excitations may be caused in several ways,
          e.g., the
          collision
          of an atom with rapidly moving positive or negative particles
          or the
          breaking
          of lines of force in an electromagnetic generator. Kinetic
          energy is
          released
          when excitation causes a particle to give up some or all of
          its kinetic
          energy to the atom during collisions. This is taking place in
          the
          universe
          all the time.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The electric motor and
          generator
          would never have been discovered if a dielectric (insulation)
          had not
          been
          discovered. If one discovers a dielectric valve for the energy
          of the
          universe,
          one has the answer to harnessing the energy of the universe! A
          limiting
          case of excitation is ionization, wherein energy is absorbed
          by the
          atom
          sufficiently to allow a loosely bound electron to leave the
          atom,
          against
          the electrostatic forces which tend to hold it within the
          atom. An atom
          which has given up one or more electrons is said to be
          ionized. It is
          possible
          that ionization, i.e., excitation, may take place in
          successive steps
          through
          absorption of quanta energy. The return of an ionized atom to
          a state
          of
          lower energy is associated with electromagnetic radiation.
          Also, from
          the
          process of ionization, electrical energy may become associated
          with the
          vibrational forces of the universe coming into the earth as
          cosmic
          radiation.
          The higher the frequency, the greater the ionization or
          excitation, a
          form
          of energy which is kinetic in nature. There are tremendous
          energies
          coming
          to the earth from outer space. These energies are only
          different
          manifestations
          of the energies we see in operation all around us. In most
          cases we are
          not even aware of their existence. "They penetrate everything
          including
          our own bodies. Every one of us is alive by virtue of these
          energies.
          Every
          part and particle of the universe is alive with them. The
          generators
          that
          now furnish our electric power do not create or originate any
          power or
          electricity; they merely direct, pump, the existing energy or

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It has been agreed that all

          is
          with the various forms of energy ---heat and light, magnetism
          and
          electricity.
          These are but forms of vibratory motion connected with and
          being
          generated
          from the same source, the universe. Matter vibrates at a
          particular
          rate,
          according to its character, and may be transmitted into other
          substance
          by lowering or raising its rate of frequency. If the frequency
          is
          raised
          high enough, the molecules will separate and the atoms become
          free.
          Raising
          the frequency still higher, the atoms resolve themselves into
          their
          original
          components. Matter then becomes a form of energy. Frequencies
          may be
          developed
          which will balance the force of gravity to a point of
          neutralization.
          One
          can then go beyond the force of gravitation. Understanding the
          principles
          of vibration is truly understanding energy.</font> </p>

          a result of Dr W. Kolhorster's measurement of penetrating

          science
          began to consider light, heat, magnetism, galvanism, and
          electricity as
          natural forces. In the early part of the 19th century school
          books
          termed
          these things "imponderable substances". The corpuscle theory
          of light
          was
          taught, the sun was supposed to provide an endless supply of
          those
          corpuscles.
          After the corpuscle theory faded, scientists turned to the
          wave theory,
          but even that was based on a crude concept of movement of the
          ultimate
          principles or atoms, of matter. The electron theory has
          superceded the
          earlier ones now, and while the electron theory explains the
          observed
          and
          theoretical "facts" better than the previous concepts did,
          could it be
          that, as the greater light of knowledge leads us on, the

          excitation
          and the creation of intermolecular and atomic ions is being

          principles
          of the wire corona with a concentric cylinder at different
          pressures.
          The
          system is modified in conformity to the concept that chemical
          reactions
          must take place when the oppositely charged molecular ions
          from an
          appropriate
          activated catalyst are accelerated against one another in the
          wire
          corona.
          It consists of a cylinder made of a suitable catalyst from
          which
          positive
          ions are emitted. The reactants (gases) streaming through the
          chamber
          parallel
          to the length of the wire attain the polarity of the negative
          molecular
          ions by the high electric field close to the wire. As these
          negative
          molecular
          ions are accelerated at the right angles to the wire in the
          direction
          of
          the electric field toward the positively charged catalyst
          cylinder,
          they
          are met by an avalanche of onrushing atomic ions from the
          catalyst. A
          certain
          amount of reaction takes place in that instant, 10-8 seconds.
          However,
          some of the negative molecular ions outside the mean free path
          of the
          positive
          atomic ions are free to rush headlong toward the positive
          cylindrical
          field
          where they are neutralized, and instantly given a positive
          charge by
          the
          avalanche of outrushing positive ions. These positive
          molecular ions
          are
          accelerated back into the field and collide against the
          negative
          molecular
          ions coming from the direction of the negative electrode

          rather
          than

          synchronized
          pull with the specially developed oscillators of high faradic

          to the

          circuit with an automatic variable relation to the
          oscillations from
          the
          universe, and capable of setting up within their circuits

          results not at first deemed possible. This is the history of
          science.
          RE

          charge
          the

          When a
          certain
          voltage is reached, ionization occurs in the gases of the

          energy into
          an oscillatory circuit; ionization sets in, a discharge
          occurs, and
          energy
          passes through another valve into other oscillators. The
          process is
          repeated
          from the first stage on to the second stage, on to the third
          and so on,
          much like a bucket brigade. That is why I asked years ago,
          "Cannot a
          steady
          flow of water be obtained from the waves of the sea or energy

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Basically the theory of

          the device by exciting it with an external energy source. The
          circuit

          coupling to
          the
          cosmic wave frequencies. The reinforcing action of the
          harmonic
          coupling
          increases the amplitude of the oscillations until the peak
          pulses
          "spill"
          over into the next stage through a special detector or valve
          which
          prevents
          the return or feedback of energy from succeeding circuits.
          These
          "pulses"
          drive this stage, which oscillates at a lower frequency and is
          again
          reinforced
          by harmonic coupling with the ever present cosmic waves. The
          second
          stage
          drives a third stage, and additional stages are coupled until
