        Abstract<br>
      </b>A chemical free, nanotechnology-based, antimicrobial platform
      using Engineered Water Nanostructures (EWNS) was recently
      developed. EWNS have high surface charge, are loaded with reactive
      oxygen species (ROS) and can interact-with and inactivate an array
      of microorganisms, including foodborne pathogens. Here, it was
      demonstrated that their properties during synthesis can be fine
      tuned and optimized to further enhance their antimicrobial
      potential. A lab based EWNS platform was developed to enable
      fine-tuning of EWNS properties by modifying synthesis parameters.
      Characterization of EWNS properties (charge, size and ROS content)
      was performed using state-of-the art analytical methods. Further
      their microbial inactivation potential was evaluated with food
      related microorganisms such as Escherichia coli, Salmonella
      enterica, Listeria innocua, Mycobacterium parafortuitum and
      Saccharomyces cerevisiae inoculated onto the surface of organic
      grape tomatoes. The results presented here indicate that EWNS
      properties can be fine-tuned during synthesis resulting in a
      multifold increase of the inactivation efficacy. More
      specifically, the surface charge quadrupled and the ROS content
      increased. Microbial removal rates were microorganism dependent
      and ranged between 1.0 to 3.8 logs after 45 mins of exposure to an
      EWNS aerosol dose of 40,000 #/cm3.<br>

        Abstract<br>
      </b>Airborne pathogens are associated with the spread of
      infectious diseases and increased morbidity and mortality. Herein
      we present an emerging chemical free, nanotechnology-based method
      for airborne pathogen inactivation. This technique is based on
      transforming atmospheric water vapor into Engineered Water
      Nano-Structures (EWNS) via electrospray. The generated EWNS
      possess a unique set of physical, chemical, morphological and
      biological properties. Their average size is 25 nm and they
      contain reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as hydroxyl and
      superoxide radicals. In addition, EWNS are highly electrically
      charged (10 electrons per particle on average). A link between
      their electric charge and the reduction of their evaporation rate
      was illustrated resulting in an extended lifetime (over an hour)
      at room conditions. Furthermore, it was clearly demonstrated that
      the EWNS have the ability to interact with and inactivate airborne
      bacteria. Finally, inhaled EWNS were found to have minimal
      toxicological effects, as illustrated in an acute in-vivo
      inhalation study using a mouse model. In conclusion, this novel,
      chemical free, nanotechnology-based method has the potential to be
      used in the battle against airborne infectious diseases.<br>

      <b>Abstract<br>
      </b>Despite advances in hygiene, sanitation and the development of
      vaccines and antibiotics, infectious diseases continue to affect
      hundreds of millions of people each year with serious health
      outcomes. Infectious diseases can be transmitted either by air
      (airborne) or via surfaces (fomites). The toll of infectious
      disease is further complicated through the evolution of
      antibiotic-resistant bacteria, while the constant antigenic shift
      of influenza viruses creates difficulties for vaccine development.
      Control of these infections remains a challenge and currently
      relies on interventions that have significant shortcomings,
      including their own health risks. New, innovative, effective, low
      cost and most importantly chemical-free, 'green' technologies,
      possessing fewer drawbacks than the existing ones, are urgently in
      need in the battle against infections. The investigators have been
      working on such a novel nanotechnology-based method. It relies on
      the synthesis of Engineered Water Nanostructures (EWNS) by
      electrospraying high purity water. Preliminary data indicate that
      EWNS possess unique physicochemical and biological properties.
      Most importantly, they are highly mobile and can inactivate
      bacteria on both surfaces and in the air through damage to their
      membrane. Here, we plan to assess and optimize EWNS as an
      alternative, chemical-free method to inactivate viruses in air and
      on environmental surfaces. The pathogen-EWNS interactions will be
      investigated using a variety of validated, state-of-the-art
      analytical methods and biological assays.<br>
      <br>
      The specific aims of this project are:<br>
      <br>
      AIM1 : Development and characterization of a high-throughput EWNS
      generation platform to study the nano-virus interaction in air and
      surfaces using relevant bioassay models. The system will be used
      for the controlled synthesis and property characterization of
      EWNS. The EWNS generation platform will enable for EWNS property
      modification (size, surface charge, ROS content, lifetime) and
      study their effect on the viral inactivation process.<br>
      <br>
      AIM 2 : Inactivation of aerosolized or surface deposited influenza
      virus (2009 H1N1) following exposure to EWNS will be assessed and
      optimized using in vitro and in vivo infectivity assays. The role
      of EWNS properties and electrospray operational parameters on the
      inactivation potential and mechanisms will be investigated using
      state of the art analytical methods. The information generated in
      these studies will lead to the development of applications of this
      novel, chemical-free approach for the control of virally
      transmitted infectious diseases such as Influenza. The proposed
      project spans disciplines in which our investigators have
      expertise: Nanoparticle synthesis, characterization and
      environmental nanotechnology (Demokritou), cellular biology,
      respiratory pathophysiology, aerobiology and infectious diseases
      (Kobzik, McDevitt). Such a novel chemical free approach, if
      successful, will reduce risk of infection and have a beneficial
      economic and public health impact.<br>
      <br>
      Public Health Relevance<br>
      Infectious diseases caused from viruses, transmitted via air and
      surfaces, continue to affect hundreds of millions of people
      worldwide with serious health outcomes including mortality and
      morbidity. Current methods of disinfection have major shortcomings
      such as use of chemicals high-energy consumption and health risks.
      In this proposal, we examine the ability of a new low cost, low
      energy, chemical free, intervention method using Engineered Water
      Nanostructures, to inactivate viruses on surfaces and in the air.
      Such a novel approach, if successful, will have huge economic and
      public health impact, and will enhance our arsenal of methods on
      reducing the risk of infection...<br>

      <b>Abstract<br>
      </b>Airborne transmitted pathogens such as Mycobacterium
      tuberculosis (Mtb) cause serious, often fatal infectious disease
      with enormous global health implications. Due to their unique cell
      wall and slow growth, mycobacteria are among the most resilient
      microbial forms. Herein we evaluate the ability of an emerging,
      chemical-free, nanotechnology-based method to inactivate M.
      parafortuitum (Mtb surrogate). This method is based on the
      transformation of atmospheric water vapor into engineered water
      nano-structures (EWNS) via electrospray. We demonstrate that the
      EWNS can interact with and inactivate airborne mycobacteria,
      reducing their concentration levels significantly. Additionally,
      EWNS can inactivate M. parafortuitum on surfaces eight times
      faster than the control. The mechanism of mycobacteria
      inactivation was also investigated in this study. It was
      demonstrated that the EWNS effectively deliver the reactive oxygen
      species, encapsulated during the electrospray process, to the
      bacteria oxidizing their cell membrane resulting into
      inactivation. Overall, this is a method with the potential to
      become an effective intervention technology in the battle against
      airborne infections...<br>
      <br>
      <b>Methods<br>
        EWNS synthesis<br>
      </b>The EWNS are synthesized via electrospray, a method used
      widely to aerosolize particles and fibers from liquid suspensions.
      Electrospray relies on a strong electric field to aerosolize a
      liquid, that is typically contained in a fine metal capillary.27
      The required strong electric field is generated by the application
      of a high voltage (most often negative voltage) between the metal
      capillary and a counter electrode positioned in a fixed distance
      from the capillary. The strong electric field causes the liquid to
      break into highly charged droplets.27 This phenomenon, known
      widely as Rayleigh effect, states that a liquid droplet with high
      surface charge density is unstable. While the surface charge
      density increases, the distance among the charges becomes smaller
      which increases the electrostatic interactions. This results in a
      non-favorable energy increase of the system forcing the droplet to
      break into smaller droplets with smaller surface charge density
      (the overall surface area increases, while the charge remains the
      same). The only force that counters the breaking is the surface
      tension. There is a critical diameter, known as Rayleigh diameter,
      for which the surface tension is not enough to counter the
      electrostatic interactions and the droplets break into smaller
      droplets.28<br>
      <b><br>
      </b>Figures 1, A and B, illustrate the electro-spray module used
      in this study and the process for the synthesis of EWNS
      respectively. In brief, a gold plated electrode is cooled down to
      6 °C via a Peltier element. The atmospheric water vapor, condensed
      on the electrode, becomes the source of water for the
      electrospray. High voltage of approximately 5 kV is applied
      between the Peltier electrode and a grounded counter electrode
      causing the water to break into small droplets as it is described
      above.24,25,29 For this particular experimental setup, the
      operational environmental conditions were maintained at 20–25 °C
      and 45–55% Relative Humidity (RH)...<br>
      <b><br>
        Discussion<br>
      </b>...The results from the lipid peroxidation assay (Figure 4)
      clearly confirm that the primary inactivation mechanism is the
      delivery of ROS to bacteria by EWNS nanoaerosol. The EWNS very
      effectively protect the otherwise short lived ROS and deliver them
      due to their highly mobile nature to the bacteria, causing
      significant lipid peroxidation and destruction of the cell
      membrane. This peroxidation effect disappeared, when the
      vitamin-C, a well-known antioxidant that prohibits ROS mediated
      lipid peroxidation,40 is added to the bacteria prior to their
      exposure. It is important to note that the vitamin-C alone does
      not seem to have any positive effect to the bacteria since the
      room air exposed vitamin-C treated bacteria do not show
      statistically significant peroxidation compared to the control
      bacteria. These data are in agreement with previous published by
      the authors work for other bacteria, demonstrating that the
      presence of EWNS results in the destruction of the bacteria cell
      membrane.24,25 Collectively, these data conclude that the ROS
      account for one of the dominant pathways of inactivation of
      bacteria exposed to EWNS.<br>
      <br>
      The electrospray-generated EWNS were found effective in
      inactivating M. parafortuitum, an Mtb surrogate. This is a
      promising finding in the fight against the tuberculosis epidemic,
      offering a cost effective intervention approach, which can be
      implemented in a variety of indoor environmental settings thus
      reducing the risk of transmission. Advantages of the proposed
      control technology include the ease of use, the low cost, and the
      low energy consumption. Overall, this is a chemical-free,
      sustainable, and environmentally friendly technology that has the
      potential to reduce the risk of transmission of diseases, such as
      tuberculosis...<br>

          using engineered water nanostructures</b><br>
        <b>Lisha Zhu, <i>et al.<br>
            <br>
          </i></b></div>
      <b>Abstract<br>
      </b>The malodor attached to textiles not only causes indoor
      environmental pollution but also endangers people's health even at
      low concentrations. Existing technologies cannot effectively
      eliminate the odor. Herein, an effective and environmentally
      friendly technology was proposed to address this challenging
      issue. This technology utilizes electrospraying process to produce
      Engineered Water Nanostructures (EWNS) in a controllable manner.
      Upon application of a high voltage to the Taylor cone, EWNS can be
      generated from the condensed vapor water through a Peltier
      element. Smoking, cooking and perspiration, considered the typical
      indoor malodorous gases emitted from human activities, were
      studied in this paper. A headspace SPME method in conjunction with
      GC-MS was employed for the extraction, detection and
      quantification of any odor residues. Results indicated that EWNS
      played a significant role in the deodorization process with
      removal efficiencies for the three odors were 95.3 ± 0.1%, 100.0 ±
      0.0% and 43.7 ± 2.3%, respectively. The Reactive Oxygen Species
      (ROS) contained in the EWNS, mainly hydroxyl (OH˙) and superoxide
      radicals Image ID:c9ra01988j-t1.gif are the possible mechanisms
      for the odor removal. These ROS are strong oxidative and highly
      reactive and have the ability to convert odorous compounds to
      non-odorous compounds through various chemical reaction
      mechanisms. This study showed clearly the potential of the
      proposed method in the field of odor removal and can be applied in
      the battle against indoor air pollution...<br>
      <b><br>
        EWNS synthesis<br>
      </b>EWNS were synthesized based on an electrospraying technique,46
      which divides liquid into fairly uniform fragments, ranging from
      few nanometers to hundred microns.47 Herein, water vapor from the
      air were condensed on an electrode cooled by a Peltier element.
      Above the electrode, a counter electrode was arranged
      concentrically. High voltage was applied between the two
      electrodes (condensing electrode, −5 kV, grounded counter
      electrodes) to form a Taylor cone due to the electrical shear
      stress. The capillary is placed at a negative voltage while the
      counter electrode is connected to a positive voltage. At this
      point, the liquid jet contained lots of negative ions.
      Subsequently, since the Coulomb repulsion instability generated by
      the ions was greater than the surface tension, the liquid jet
      continued to be dispersed into fine droplets.27,48–50 As the
      droplets volume decreased, the charge density of the droplets
      exceeded the limit of surface tension, causing these droplets
      spontaneously split, eventually reaching a stable radius called
      Rayleigh critical radius51 and producing EWNS. The generation
      process of EWNS is illustrated in Fig. 1. <br>
      <br>
      During this electrospray process, some water molecules and oxygen
      molecules were split or lost electrons under high electric field
      creating several kinds of ROS, like OH˙ and 52,53 It has been
      proven that those ROS are encapsulated in EWNS, which prevents
      them from neutralization by other air molecules and extends
      significantly their lifetime.54 Detailed information on the EWNS
      synthesis can be found in the series paper of the Harvard
      group.27–29,40 Unlike the previous studies by the Harvard group,
      in this study, a novel EWNS generator was employed with a new type
      of linear structure electrode developed by the Panasonic
      Corporation. It can increase significantly the discharging area
      and produces increased concentrations of ROS per unit of time...<br>

        Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b>Hand hygiene is a critical public health issue associated with
      disease transmission worldwide. Here, a nanotechnology-based
      approach has been employed to enhance hand hygiene using
      engineered water nanostructures (EWNS) synthesized by electrospray
      and ionization of antimicrobial aqueous solutions. The EWNS
      possess unique properties: have a tunable size in the nanoscale,
      are electrically charged, which results in a lifespan of hours in
      room conditions, and can carry both antimicrobial agents and
      reactive oxygen species (ROS) from ionization of water. More
      importantly, EWNS are highly mobile, can be directed toward a
      surface of interest utilizing their electric charge, and can
      inactivate pathogens by delivering active ingredients (AIs) and
      ROS. In this study, a variety of AIs commonly used for hand
      sanitization and food safety, such as hydrogen peroxide, citric
      acid, lysozyme, and nisin, were utilized to synthesize various
      EWNS-based nanosanitizers and inactivate hand hygiene-related
      pathogens. A 0.5 min exposure to various EWNS-based nanosanitizers
      reduced Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and bacteriophage
      MS2 by ∼3, 1, and 2 log, respectively. More importantly, such an
      aerosol-based nanocarrier platform, because of its targeted
      delivery manner, utilizes only nanograms of “nature-inspired”
      antimicrobials and leaves behind no chemical byproducts, making it
      an efficient approach for hand sanitization.<br>

          Nanotoxicology looks to improve on soap and water</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Nanosafety researchers at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public
      Health have developed a new intervention to fight infectious
      disease by more effectively disinfecting the air around us, our
      food, our hands, and whatever else harbors the microbes that make
      us sick. The researchers, from the School’s Center for
      Nanotechnology and Nanotoxicology, were led by Associate Professor
      of Aerosol Physics Philip Demokritou, the center’s director, and
      first author Runze Huang, a postdoctoral fellow there. They used a
      nano-enabled platform developed at the center to create and
      deliver tiny, aerosolized water nonodroplets containing non-toxic,
      nature-inspired disinfectants wherever desired. Demokritou talked
      to the Gazette about the invention and its application on hand
      hygiene, which was described recently in the journal ACS
      Sustainable Chemistry and Engineering.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Q&amp;A with Philip Demokritou</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      GAZETTE:&nbsp; Give us a quick overview of the problem you’re
      trying to solve.<br>
      DEMOKRITOU:&nbsp; If you go back to the ’60s and the invention of
      many antibiotics, we thought that the chapter on infectious
      diseases would be closed. Of course, 60 years later, we now know
      that’s not true. Infectious diseases are still emerging.
      Microorganisms are smarter than we thought and evolving new
      strains. It’s a constant battle. And when I talk about infectious
      diseases, I’m mainly talking about airborne and foodborne
      diseases: For example, flu and tuberculosis are airborne diseases,
      respiratory diseases, which cause millions of deaths a year.
      Foodborne diseases also kill 500,000 people annually and cost our
      economy billions of dollars.<br>
      <br>
      GAZETTE: Diarrheal diseases are big killers of kids, too.<br>
      DEMOKRITOU: It’s a big problem, especially in developing countries
      with fragmented health care systems.<br>
      <br>
      GAZETTE: What’s wrong with how we sanitize our hands?<br>
      DEMOKRITOU: We hear all the time that you have to wash your hands.
      It’s a primary measure to reduce infectious diseases. More
      recently, we’re also using antiseptics. Alcohol is OK, but we are
      also using other chemicals like triclosan and chlorhexadine.
      There’s research linking these chemicals to the increase in
      antimicrobial resistance, among other drawbacks. In addition, some
      people are sensitive to frequent washes and rubbing with
      chemicals. That’s where new approaches come into play. So, within
      the last four or five years, we’ve been trying to develop
      nanotechnology-based interventions to fight infectious diseases.<br>
      <br>
      GAZETTE: So the technology involved here — the engineered water
      nanostructures — is a couple of years old. What’s new is the
      application?<br>
      DEMOKRITOU: We have the tools to make these engineered
      nanomaterials and, in this particular case, we can take water and
      turn it into an engineered water nanoparticle, which carries its
      deadly payload, primarily nontoxic, nature-inspired
      antimicrobials, and kills microorganisms on surfaces and in the
      air.<br>
      <br>
      It is fairly simple, you need 12 volts DC, and we combine that
      with electrospray and ionization to turn water into a nanoaerosol,
      in which these engineered nanostructures are suspended in the air.
      These water nanoparticles have unique properties because of their
      small size and also contain reactive oxygen species. These are
      hydroxyl radicals, peroxides, and are similar to what nature uses
      in cells to kill pathogens. These nanoparticles, by design, also
      carry an electric charge, which increases surface energy and
      reduces evaporation. That means these engineered nanostructures
      can remain suspended in air for hours. When the charge dissipates,
      they become water vapor and disappear.<br>
      <br>
      Very recently, we started using these structures as a carrier, and
      we can now incorporate nature-inspired antimicrobials into their
      chemical structure. These are not super toxic to humans. For
      instance, my grandmother in Greece used to disinfect her surfaces
      with lemon juice — citric acid. Or, in milk — and also found in
      tears — is another highly potent antimicrobial called lysozyme.
      Nisin is another nature-inspired antimicrobial that bacteria
      release when they’re competing with other bacteria. Nature
      provides us with a ton of nontoxic antimicrobials that, if we can
      find a way to deliver them in a targeted, precise manner, can do
      the job. No need to invent new and potentially toxic chemicals.
      Let’s go to nature’s pharmacy and shop.<br>
      <br>
      When we put these nature-inspired antimicrobials into the
      engineered water nanostructures, their antimicrobial potency
      increases dramatically. But we do that without using huge
      quantities of antimicrobials, about 1 percent or 2 percent by
      volume. Most of the engineered water nanostructure is still water.<br>
      <br>
      At this point, these engineered structures are carrying
      antimicrobials and are charged, and we can use the charge to
      direct them to surfaces by applying a weak electric field. You can
      also release them into the air — they’re highly mobile — and they
      can move around and inactivate flu virus, for example.<br>
      <br>
      GAZETTE: How would this work with food?<br>
      DEMOKRITOU: This nano-enabled platform can be used as an
      intervention technology for food safety applications as well. When
      it comes to disinfecting our food, we’re still using archaic
      approaches developed in the ’50s. For instance, today we put our
      fresh produce into chlorine-based solutions, which leave residues
      that can compromise health. It leaves behind byproducts, which are
      toxic, and you have to find a way to deal with them as well.<br>
      <br>
      Instead, you can use the water nanoaerosols that contain nanogram
      levels of an active ingredient — nature-inspired and not toxic —
      and disinfect our food. Currently, this novel invention is being
      explored for use — from the farm to the fork — to enhance food
      safety and quality.<br>
      <br>
      GAZETTE: So when you use it on food, you would essentially spray
      the nanoparticles onto a head of lettuce, for example?<br>
      DEMOKRITOU: It depends on the application. You can put this
      technology in your refrigerator, and it will kill microbes on food
      surfaces and in the air there and improve food safety. It will
      also increase shelf life, which is linked to spoilage
      microorganisms. You can also use this technology for air
      disinfection. The only thing you need is 12-volt DC, which you can
      power from your computer USB port. Imagine sitting on a train and
      you generate an invisible shield of these engineered water
      nanostructures that protects you and minimizes the risk of getting
      the flu.<br>
      <br>
      GAZETTE: If you’re on the train with a bunch of sick people?<br>
      DEMOKRITOU: Exactly, or on an airplane, anywhere you have
      microorganisms. Most planes recirculate the air, and all it takes
      is one sick guy — he doesn’t have to be sitting next to you — to
      get sick. Unfortunately, that’s a big problem. The newer airplanes
      have filtration to remove some of these pathogens. But this is a
      very versatile technology that you can pretty much take with you.<br>
      <br>
      GAZETTE:&nbsp; Let’s talk about hand hygiene.<br>
      DEMOKRITOU:&nbsp; We know hand hygiene is very important, but in
      addition to the drawbacks of washing with water or using
      chemicals, the air dryers commonly used in the bathroom
      environment can aerosolize microbes and put them back in the air
      and even back on your hands. So there is room to utilize these
      engineered water nanostructures and develop an alternative that is
      airless and waterless — because it uses picogram levels of water,
      your hands will never get wet.<br>
      <br>
      GAZETTE: So you’re washing your hands, using water. But they don’t
      get wet?<br>
      DEMOKRITOU: Exactly. And it disinfects hands in a matter of 15–20
      seconds, as indicated in our recently published study.<br>
      <br>
      GAZETTE: As far as an application goes, do you see something
      similar to the hand driers we all use at highway rest stops? Only,
      when you stick your hands in, it doesn’t blow? Do you feel
      anything at all?<br>
      DEMOKRITOU: You don’t feel anything. That’s the problem; this is
      like magic. You don’t see; you don’t feel; you don’t smell; but
      your hands are sanitized.<br>
      <br>
      GAZETTE: So how do people know anything’s happened? As humans we
      want some sort of stimulation.<br>
      DEMOKRITOU: We could put a light and music to entertain people,
      but nobody can see a 25-nanometer particle. We are excited to see
      that there is interest from industry to pursue commercialization
      of this technology for hand hygiene. We may soon have an airless,
      waterless apparatus that can be used across the board, though not
      necessarily in the bathroom environment. This can be a
      battery-operated device, it can be placed around airports and
      other spots where people don’t have time or access to water to
      wash their hands.<br>
