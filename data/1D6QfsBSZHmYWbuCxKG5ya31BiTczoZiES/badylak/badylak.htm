            <p><b>[ Stephen Badylak</b>, a senior research scientist at
              Purdue University, holds a piece of material harvested
              from a pig's bladder. ]</p>

        </div>
        <p><br>
          Lee Spievack, of Cincinnati, who sliced almost half an inch
          off the top of one of his fingers, described the powder as
          “pixie dust,” according to the newspaper. </p>
        <p>The “pixie dust” is actually extra-cellular matrix, bursting
          with collagen and is made from a dried pig’s bladder, the
          newspaper reports. </p>
        <p>The dust was designed to regenerate damaged ligaments in
          horses, the Daily Mail said. </p>
        <p>Collagen is known to give skin strength and elasticity. It is
          thought that the dust kick-starts the body's natural healing
          process by sending out signals that mobilize the body's own
          cells into repairing the damaged tissue, according to the
          newspaper. </p>
        <p>Spievack said his finger even has a fingernail and
          fingerprint. </p>
        <p>Spievack injured his finger three years ago when it got
          caught in the propeller of a model plane. He did not want a
          skin graft, opting instead to try the “pixie dust.” </p>
        <p>“There are all sorts of signals in the body,” said Dr.
          Stephen Badylak of the McGowan Institute for Regenerative
          Medicine at the University of Pittsburgh. “We have signals
          that are good for forming scar tissue and others that are good
          for regenerating tissues. </p>
        <p>"One way to think about these matrices is that we've taken
          out many of the stimuli for scar tissue formation and left
          those signals which were always there for constructive
          remodeling." </p>
        <p>Essentially, the powder directs tissues to grow fresh instead
          of forming a scar. </p>
        <p>Spievak has not lost any bone, nerves or tendon material. </p>

          <p><b><font size="+1">&nbsp;The Man Who Grew a Finger</font></b>
          </p>
          <p><b>By Matthew Price</b> <br>
            <b>BBC News, Ohio</b></p>
        </center>
        <p align="left">In every town in every part of this sprawling
          country you can find a faceless sprawling strip mall in which
          to do the shopping. </p>
        <p align="left">Rarely though would you expect to find a medical
          miracle working behind the counter of the mall's hobby shop. </p>
        <p align="left">That however is what Lee Spievak considers
          himself to be. </p>
        <p align="left">"I put my finger in," Mr Spievak says, pointing
          towards the propeller of a model aeroplane, "and that's when I
          sliced my finger off." </p>
        <p align="left">It took the end right off, down to the bone,
          about half an inch. </p>
        <p align="left">"We don't know where the piece went." </p>
        <p align="left">The photos of his severed finger tip are pretty
          graphic. You can understand why doctors said he'd lost it for
          good. </p>
        <p align="left">Today though, you wouldn't know it. Mr Spievak,
          who is 69 years old, shows off his finger, and it's all there,
          tissue, nerves, nail, skin, even his finger print. </p>
        <p align="left"><b>'Pixie dust'</b> </p>
        <p align="left">How? Well that's the truly remarkable part. It
          wasn't a transplant. Mr Spievak re-grew his finger tip. He
          used a powder - or pixie dust as he sometimes refers to it
          while telling his story. </p>
        <p align="left">Mr Speivak's brother Alan - who was working in
          the field of regenerative medicine - sent him the powder. </p>
        <p align="left">For ten days Mr Spievak put a little on his
          finger. </p>
        <p align="left">"The second time I put it on I already could see
          growth. Each day it was up further. Finally it closed up and
          was a finger. </p>
        <p align="left">"It took about four weeks before it was sealed."
        </p>
        <p align="left">Now he says he has "complete feeling, complete
          movement." </p>
        <p align="left">The "pixie dust" comes from the University of
          Pittsburgh, though in the lab Dr Stephen Badylak prefers to
          call it extra cellular matrix. </p>
        <p align="left"><b>Pig's bladder</b> </p>
        <p align="left">The process he has been pioneering over the last
          few years involves scraping the cells from the lining of a
          pig's bladder. </p>
        <p align="left">Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires
          JavaScript to play. </p>
        <p align="left">How it works in detail The remaining tissue is
          then placed into acid, "cleaned" of all cells, and dried out.
        </p>
        <p align="left">It can be turned into sheets, or a powder. </p>
        <p align="left">It looks like a simple process, but of course
          the science is complex. </p>
        <p align="left">"There are all sorts of signals in the body,"
          explains Dr Badylak. </p>
        <p align="left">"We have got signals that are good for forming
          scar, and others that are good for regenerating tissues. </p>
        <p align="left">"One way to think about these matrices is that
          we have taken out many of the stimuli for scar tissue
          formation and left those signals that were always there anyway
          for constructive remodelling." </p>
        <p align="left">In other words when the extra cellular matrix is
          put on a wound, scientists believe it stimulates cells in the
          tissue to grow rather than scar. </p>
        <p align="left">If they can perfect the technique, it might mean
          one day they could repair not just a severed finger, but
          severely burnt skin, or even damaged organs. </p>
        <p align="left"><b>Clinical trial</b> </p>
        <p align="left">They hope soon to start a clinical trial in
          Buenos Aires on a woman who has cancer of the oesophagus. </p>
        <p align="left">The normal procedure in such cases is often
          deadly. Doctors remove the cancerous portion and try to
          stretch the stomach lining up to meet the shortened
          oesophagus. </p>
        <p align="left">In the trial they will place the extra cellular
          matrix inside the body from where the portion of oesophagus
          has been removed, and hope to stimulate the cells around it to
          re-grow the missing portion. </p>
        <p align="left">So could limbs be re-grown? Dr Badylak is
          cautious, but believes the technology is potentially
          revolutionary. </p>
        <p align="left">"I think that within ten years that we will have
          strategies that will re-grow the bones, and promote the growth
          of functional tissue around those bones. And that is a major
          step towards eventually doing the entire limb." </p>
        <p align="left">That kind of talk has got the US military
          interested. </p>
        <p align="left">They are just about to start trials to re-grow
          parts of the fingers of injured soldiers. </p>
        <p align="left"><b>Skin burns</b> </p>
        <p align="left">They also hope the matrix might help veterans
          like Robert Henline re-grow burnt skin. </p>
        <p align="left">He was almost killed in an explosion while
          serving in Iraq. His four colleagues travelling with him in
          the army Humvee were all killed. </p>
        <p align="left">He suffered 35% burns to his head and upper
          body. His ears are almost totally gone, the skin on his head
          has been burnt to the bone, his face is a swollen raw mess. </p>
        <p align="left">So far he has undergone surgery 25 times. He
          reckons he has got another 30 to go. </p>
        <p align="left">Anything that could be done in terms of
          regeneration would be great he says. </p>
        <p align="left">"Life changing! I think I'm more scared of
          hospitals than I am of going back to Iraq again." </p>
        <p align="left">Like any developing technology there are many
          unknowns. There are worries about encouraging cancerous
          growths by using the matrix. </p>
        <p align="left">Doctors though believe that within the so called
          pixie dust lies an amazing medical discovery. </p>
