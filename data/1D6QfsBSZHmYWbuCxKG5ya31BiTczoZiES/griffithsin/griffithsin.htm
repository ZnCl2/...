      <br>
      While researchers scramble to develop a vaccine or monoclonal
      antibody against the Ebola virus – and continue to develop chemo
      treatments to stem HIV and Hepatitis-C while fearing SARS – nature
      has already provided a natural treatment.<br>
      <br>
      Research has shown that a healthy strong immune system can allow a
      person to not only avoid contracting the disease – but become
      resistant to it as well.<br>
      <br>
      For those of us who need help or extract assurance, red algae
      proves to provide a key antiviral.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Hunting Natural Immunity For Ebola</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      After the two 1996 Ebola outbreaks in Gabon Africa, medical
      scientists determined that about Ebola causes death among about 70
      percent of those who contracted the virus.<br>
      <br>
      This question led researchers from Gabon's Franceville
      International Center of Medical Research to investigate. The
      questions ensued: Why don't the other 30 percent die? How do 30
      percent of those infected recover?<br>
      <br>
      Furthermore, medical researchers found many instances where there
      were close contacts of those who became infected who never were
      infected at all. Even though they were in contact with the
      infected patient while the patient was symptomatic.<br>
      <br>
      Note: An infected patient with Ebola must be symptomatic in order
      to be contagious – with fever and other flu-like symptoms. A
      person must also have direct mucosal or blood contact in order to
      become infected with the virus. This means a transfer of saliva,
      urine, semen or blood from one person to another.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, when the researchers investigated "close contact"
      individuals, they focused upon those who had this sort of
      exposure.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Ebola Antibodies</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The research found that nearly half of those who were asymptomatic
      and seemingly immune developed antibodies (IgM and IgG) to the
      Ebola virus.<br>
      <br>
      This means these individuals certainly were intimately exposed to
      the virus, but simply naturally developed the immunity tools -
      including those discussed below - that prevented the infection
      from replicating out of control.<br>
      <br>
      Furthermore, the asymptomatic group exhibited greater
      anti-inflammatory responses in general. They were found to have
      higher levels of circulating cytokines and chemokines – which
      speed up the body's natural ability to break down the viral cells
      and stop their activity within the body.<br>
      <br>
      They concluded: "Asymptomatic individuals had a strong
      inflammatory response by high circulating concentrations of
      cytokines and chemokines."<br>
      <br>
      <b>Mannose-Binding Lectins Attack Ebola Virus</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The particular mechanism with which the body naturally breaks down
      and prevents infection from lethal infections including Ebola,
      HIV, HCV and SARS has gradually emerged.<br>
      <br>
      The mechanism is called mannose-binding lectins. Mannose-binding
      lectins are apparently produced in the human body via a DNA
      sequence, called the MBL2.<br>
      <br>
      When this part of our genes is in order, the body will produce and
      release these mannose-binding lectins into the bloodstream.
      Mannose-binding lectins will then recognize and glom onto certain
      carbohydrate molecules that cover and make up various
      microorganisms.<br>
      <br>
      These include fungi, bacteria and even parasites, which utilize
      glycoprotein shells to protect themselves. But they also include
      viruses. Once the lectins attach to these shells, they will break
      apart the surface of the microbe and basically break them down,
      allowing the body's other immune cells to kill off the microbe and
      prevent it from replicating.<br>
      <br>
      In fact, a healthy body that produces good levels of these
      mannose-binding lectins will be able to easily fight off colds and
      flus, as well as other microbial infections. Several animal
      studies have shown mannose-binding lectins heartily beat down
      coronaviruses and infectious bronchitis.<br>
      <br>
      Research over the past five years has found that low levels of
      mannose-binding lectins increases the risk of respiratory
      infections, including syncytial virus infections, pneumonia and
      others.<br>
      <br>
      For example, in a study of 121 children, RSV-infections were
      associated with low levels of mannose-binding lectins. Nearly 70
      percent of RSV-infected children had low levels of mannose-binding
      lectins. But other infections – especially those related to
      bacterial infections – are not necessarily connected with
      mannose-binding lectin levels.<br>
      <br>
      When it comes to virulent infections such as Ebola, Hepatitis C
      and HIV, however, these are different. These viruses come with
      glycoprotein shells that protect the virus from being broken down.<br>
      <br>
      Furthermore, the glycoprotein shell of the Ebola virus produces
      glycoproteins that damage cells, allowing the virus to penetrate
      and replicate within the cell.<br>
      <br>
      Mannose-binding lectins actually break down this shell and the
      glycoprotein matrix through a mechanism called the lectin pathway.<br>
      <br>
      Humans that don't produce enough of these mannose-binding lectins
      are not only more susceptible because they don't have enough
      lectins, but they are typically also immunosuppressed with regard
      to the rest of their immune system.<br>
      <br>
      One of the reason some humans don't produce enough mannose-binding
      lectins is because of a slight genetic mutation, where the MBL2
      gene is switched off. The reason for this mutation/switch-off has
      yet to be fully understood. (Guess - something to do with our
      toxic environment and/or nutritional deficiency.)<br>
      <br>
      <b>Mannose-Binding Lectins From Red Algae</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      This brings us to the fun part. Yes, humans aren't the only
      critters that produce mannose-binding lectins. Red algae also
      produce these profusely, which allow the algae to protect
      themselves from invasion by viruses.<br>
      <br>
      The most promising form of mannose-binding lectins is a component
      of the Scytonema varium red algae called Scytovirin. The protein
      extract was isolated by researchers from the National Cancer
      Institute at Frederick, Maryland in 2003. The protein contains 95
      amino acids, and was found to bind to HIV-1 viral shells.<br>
      <br>
      A similar antiviral protein was found in Nostoc ellipsosporum –
      called Cyanovirin-N. Both of these antiviral proteins did similar
      things – they broke down the glycoprotein shells of HIV and HCV.<br>
      <br>
      Yet another anti-viral extract was found from the New Zealand red
      alga species, Griffithsia sp. This protein is called Griffithsin,
      abbreviated with GRFT.<br>
      <br>
      Over the next few years, Griffithsin was tested against HIV-1 with
      great success in laboratory studies, which included studies with
      mice. The epidemic-potential virus SARS was also tested against
      Griffithsin, also with great success.<br>
      <br>
      Multiple studies illustrated these effects. Research from the
      Center for Cancer Research in Frederick, Maryland found that
      Griffithsin not only stopped HIV-1 virus replication, but stopped
      cellular intrusion of the virus.<br>
      <br>
      In 2010 Harvard researchers tested a recombinant version of
      Griffithsin – called rhMBL – against Ebola. Once again, they found
      the mannose-binding lectins were able to not only breakdown the
      viral shells of the Ebola, but when given to mice infected with
      Ebola, the mice became immune to the virus.<br>
      <br>
      Yes, when the mice given the recombinant mannose-binding lectins
      were rechallenged with the Ebola virus, they were found to be
      immune to the Ebola virus.<br>
      <br>
      Since that study other research has tested other animals with
      Griffithsin, with similar results.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Recombinant Griffithsin Produced in Nicotiana Benthamiana
        Plants</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      As modern medical researchers continually strive for isolated and
      synthesized versions of nature able to be patented, recombinant
      versions of Griffithsin were eventually produced using Nicotiana
      benthamiana plants (a relative of the tobacco plant). These plants
      were genetically modified so they would produce the same
      mannose-binding lectins.<br>
      <br>
      This form of Griffithsin was tested on mice and guinea pigs
      infected with HIV-1, with successful antiviral results.<br>
      <br>
      This was also found when testing the recombinant Griffithsin on
      Ebola-infected mice.<br>
      <br>
      In all the studies, the Griffithsin was found to be safe and
      tolerated.<br>
      <br>
      As to whether red algae can be taken in natural form to increase
      immunity, there is no doubt this is the case. Prior to this
      antiviral research that has spiraled into biopharm research, red
      algae had been shown to have antiviral and anticancer effects.<br>
      <br>
      So the most logical answer is "yes" – certainly consuming red
      algae in supplement form has been found to boost antiviral
      immunity, and from the available research, blood levels of
      mannose-binding lectins. This should in turn boost immunity and
      create a natural method of preventing and even treating viral
      infections such as Ebola, SARS, HIV and Hepatitis-C.<br>
      <br>
      Of course, this strategy should be used with other natural
      immunity-boosting strategies.<br>
      <br>
      Other plants also produce these mannose-binding lectins, some of
      which have been used in traditional medicines. A study from
      Belgium's University of Leuven studied 33 different plant lectins,
      and found 10 different mannose-binding lectins among the plants
      that inhibited coronovirus, and intervened upon the replication
      cycle of SARS-CoV.<br>

      <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) targets diverse microorganisms for
      phagocytosis and complement-mediated lysis by binding specific
      surface glycans. Although recombinant human MBL (rhMBL) trials
      have focused on reconstitution therapy, safety studies have
      identified no barriers to its use at higher levels. Ebola viruses
      cause fatal hemorrhagic fevers for which no treatment exists and
      that are feared as potential biothreat agents. We found that mice
      whose rhMBL serum concentrations were increased =7-fold above
      average human levels survived otherwise fatal Ebola virus
      infections and became immune to virus rechallenge. Because Ebola
      glycoproteins potentially model other glycosylated viruses, rhMBL
      may offer a novel broad-spectrum antiviral approach.<br>
      <br>
      Circulating mannose-binding lectin (MBL) is a first-line host
      defense against a wide range of viral and other pathogens. MBL is
      a C-type lectin that recognizes hexose sugars including mannose,
      glucose, fucose, and N-acetylglucosamine on the surface of many
      pathogens. It does not recognize the terminal carbohydrates
      galactose and sialic acid on normal host cells. Therefore, MBL
      preferentially recognizes glycosylated viruses including influenza
      virus, human immunodeficiency virus, severe acute respiratory
      syndrome coronovirus (SARS-CoV), Ebola virus, and Marburg virus.
      It also recognizes many glycosylated gram-positive and
      gram-negative bacteria [1, 2]. As a result of common genetic
      variants, MBL serum levels in humans range from 0 to 10,000 ng/mL.
      Thirty percent of the human population has levels &lt;500 ng/mL,
      which are associated with increased susceptibility to infections
      in children and immunocompromised individuals [3].<br>
      <br>
      We previously reported preclinical studies that addressed the
      potential utility of recombinant human MBL (rhMBL) reconstitution
      therapy. MBL-knockout mice are highly susceptible to several
      bacteria including Staphylococcus aureus [1]. RhMBL improved
      survival in MBL-null mice to approximate survival among infected
      wild-type mice at doses that reconstituted the
      complement-activating capacity of MBL-knockout serum to a level
      comparable to that of wild-type mouse serum [1]. Doses of
      plasma-derived MBL and rhMBL designed to increase MBL
      concentrations to physiologic levels (&gt;1000 ng/mL) in
      MBL-deficient humans were safe in early trials and did not elicit
      antibodies [3–5]. In contrast, although MBL replacement therapy
      enhanced opsonophagocytic potential, higher levels of
      plasma-derived MBL were needed to achieve MBL-mediated complement
      activation comparable to healthy controls [6], suggesting that
      above-replacement dosing will need attention.<br>
      <br>
      Ebola and Marburg viruses of the filovirus family are among the
      most virulent causes of the human viral hemorrhagic fevers and
      cause devastating epidemics of fulminant and rapidly fatal
      disease. They constitute important biological threat agents
      because of their high mortality rates, capacity for large-scale
      dissemination, and potential for causing social disruption.
      Currently, there are no US Food and Drug Administration–approved
      therapeutic agents available to prevent or treat these lethal
      viral infections. Filovirus surface glycoproteins (GPs) are
      heavily glycosylated and contain high-mannose. As a result, MBL
      binds to Ebola and Marburg viruses and mediates
      complement-dependent virus neutralization [2]. Importantly, their
      surface glycoprotein structures are characteristic of a broad
      group of viruses in which N-linked glycosylation contributes to
      viral virulence [7]. Reasoning that MBL treatment is likely to be
      safe at supraphysiological levels, we evaluated an in vivo Ebola
      virus model to explore the possibility of using MBL as an
      immunotherapeutic agent. Our results showed that
      supraphysiological doses of MBL rescued ~40% of mice from lethal
      challenges when administered pre– or post–Ebola virus exposure.
      This novel paradigm suggests that high-dose MBL should be
      evaluated more broadly as an immunotherapeutic agent for a wide
      spectrum of glycosylated pathogens.<br>
      <br>
      <b>MATERIALS AND METHODS</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      <b>Production and pharmacokinetics of rhMBL</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Commercial-grade rhMBL was provided by Enzon Pharmaceuticals [8].
      Human MBL concentrations and complement cleavage activity were
      measured as described elsewhere [9]. Pharmacokinetics of rhMBL
      concentration–time data were evaluated using noncompartmental
      modeling with WinNonlin Professional Edition (version 5.2;
      Pharsight). The area under the curve from zero to infinity
      (AUC0–8) values were calculated using the linear trapezoidal
      method.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Murine Ebola model</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      We used a validated lethal Ebola Zaire mouse model developed at
      the US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases
      (USAMRIID) [10], with a double plaque-purified, mouse-adapted,
      Ebola isolate, EZ'76 Mp3 Vp2 Mp9 GH. The virus was inoculated
      intraperitoneally (i.p.) at 100 pfu (3000 × LD50) producing
      uniformly lethal disease in C57B6 mice using biosafety level-4
      facilities. Research was conducted in compliance with the Animal
      Welfare Act and federal regulations in a fully accredited
      facility. To assess the effect of rhMBL on virus lethality, we
      treated Ebola virus–infected C57B6 mice i.p. with either 4.3 mg/kg
      or 20 mg/kg of rhMBL twice daily ~12 hours apart for 10 days. On
      the day of virus exposure, mice were treated and exposed to 100
      pfu of mouse-adapted Ebola Zaire either 12 hours before or 1 hour
      after the first dose of rhMBL as indicated in Figure 1.<br>

        inoculation. Sham-treated wild-type mice were compared with
        wild-type ...</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Mice were assessed daily for changes in physical appearance and
      weight. Viremia was assessed by reverse transcription-polymerase
      chain reaction (RT-PCR) and plaque assays as described elsewhere
      [11], and anti–Ebola virus antibodies were measured using standard
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) [12]. Standard blood
      counts were evaluated with a Coulter AC·T diff (Beckman Coulter).
      For analysis with flow cytometry, spleens were ground into single
      cell suspensions with the BD Medimachine tissue grinder. After
      incubation with Fc Block (BD), cells were washed and incubated
      with antibody (CD3 FITC BD no. 555274, CD8 V450 BD no. 560469,
      CD14 PerCP eBio no. 45-0141, CD4 PE eBio no. 12-0041-82, CD11b APC
      BD no. 553312, and CD19 PE-Cy7 BD no. 557655). Cells were washed
      with PBS and fixed in BD cytofix. Data were immediately acquired
      with a BD FACSCantoII and analyzed with FlowJo (version 7). The
      Bio-Plex Mouse Cytokine 23-Plex Panel assay (Bio-Rad 171-F11241)
      was used to measure multiple cytokines, chemokines, and growth
      factors in serum and tissue supernatants according to the
      manufacturer's instructions. Mice that survived the initial
      infection were tested for Ebola-specific serological response on
      day 21 and rechallenged with the same virus dose without further
      treatment, and antibody titers were retested 28 days later.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      <b>RESULTS</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      We previously found that rhMBL bound Ebola (Zaire) and Marburg
      (Musoke) envelope GPs [2]. RhMBL effectively blocked Ebola GP
      interactions with DC-SIGN, and HIV particles lacking gp120/gp41
      pseudotyped with Ebola or Marburg GPs were neutralized by the
      lectin complement pathway [2]. To develop an in vivo test of rhMBL
      effectiveness, we determined that 100 ng/mL of rhMBL was the
      minimum concentration needed to inhibit =90% infectivity of HepG2
      cells using Ebola GP pseudotyped lentiviral particles and to
      inhibit =90% infectivity of Vero E6 cells using recombinant Ebola
      Zaire virus (Mayinga strain)-eGFP (data not shown). We had
      previously found that a single intraperitoneal dose of 75 µg of
      rhMBL reconstituted the lectin complement pathway in MBL-knockout
      mice [1]. We compared the pharmacokinetic parameters (Table 1) of
      that single reconstitution dose (4.3 mg/kg) with a higher single
      intraperitoneal dose of 350 µg (20 mg/kg) to identify a
      potentially supraphysiological dose to test in model infections.
      The average maximum serum concentration (Cmax) of both doses
      exceeded the minimum concentration of MBL that inhibited infection
      in vitro by at least 55-fold. The average ratio of maximum to
      baseline complement component 4 cleavage activity was 1.7 for the
      75-µg rhMBL dose and 5.4 for the 350-µg dose.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Table 1.</b><b><br>
      </b><b>Pharmacokinetic Parameters of Low- vs High-Dose Recombinant
        Human Mannose-Binding Lectin (rhMBL) Therapy in Uninfected Mice</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Intraperitoneal administration of 100 pfu of native Ebola Zaire
      virus (3000 × LD50) is uniformly fatal in mice. Treatment with 75
      µg of rhMBL per dose every 12 hours failed to protect mice from
      that virus inoculum. Therefore, we increased rhMBL to 350 µg
      administered every 12 hours for 10 days starting either 1 hour
      before or 12 hours after Ebola virus challenge (Figure 1A and 1B).
      When treatment was started 1 hour before virus infection, the
      supraphysiological dose increased survival to &gt; 40% of mice in
      several trials (Figure 1A). We then started treatment 12 hours
      after viral infection. We compared survival in wild-type and
      complement component 3 (C3)–deficient mice as the inhibitory
      effects of MBL on Ebola virus are mediated by complement in cell
      culture [2]. Once again we saw an increase in survival from 0% to
      &gt;40% in rhMBL-treated mice, and survival was dependent on an
      intact complement pathway, since C3-deficient mice did not survive
      (Figure 1B). All inoculated mice showed signs of infection
      according to standardized observation scores and weight loss, and
      surviving mice had detectable Ebola virus–specific antibodies 28
      days after infection (data not shown).<br>
      <br>
      We monitored the effect of treatment started 12 hours after
      infection on a variety of laboratory indices. Mean white blood
      cell counts were 9100 cells/mL in MBL-treated mice (n = 5)
      compared with 4525 cells/mL on day 7 after infection in the
      surviving sham-treated mice (n = 4). Average lymphocyte counts
      were also higher in MBL-treated mice compared with controls (5500
      cells/mL vs 2800 cells/mL, respectively). A similar trend was seen
      for platelet counts, which averaged 726,000 cells/mL in the
      treatment group and 239,000 cells/mL in the controls. These
      differences were statistically significant for platelet counts on
      day 5 (672,000 cells/mL vs 322,000 cells/mL, P = .014; Figure 1C).<br>
      <br>
      In a separate experiment, spleens were harvested on day 5 after
      infection (4 sham-treated and 4 MBL-treated mice). Constituent
      cell populations were assayed by flow cytometry. Numbers of
      splenic CD3-CD19+ cells (B lymphocytes) and CD11b+ granulocytes
      were higher in MBL-treated mice (89.2% vs 85.1%, P = .019; 17.6%
      vs 12.8%, P = .04, respectively). The RNA viral loads as
      determined by RT-PCR in blood, liver, and spleen 5 days after
      infection were similar in sham- and rhMBL-treated mice (P &gt;
      .05). Virus titers in blood were generally lower on days 1 and 3
      in rhMBL-treated mice as determined by plaque assays (P &gt; .05;
      Figure 1D). Of 23 cytokines and chemokines tested in serum, liver,
      and spleen on day 5 after inoculation, lower values (fluorescence
      intensity units) for interleukin (IL)-1b (170 vs 253, P = .07),
      IL-5 (89 vs 112, P = .03), IL-10 (379 vs 518, P = .004), IL-13
      (264 vs 384, P = .008), and IL-17 (120 vs 174, P = .028) were
      found in liver homogenates from rhMBL-treated mice (Figure 1E). We
      tested protective immunity in 5 seropositive mice that survived
      initial infection by rechallenging them with native Ebola virus 28
      days after initial infection. It is noteworthy that all
      MBL-treated survivors also survived the second viral challenge.
      Similar or higher immunoglobulin G, A, and M antibody titers were
      seen 28 days after the second challenge with the virus (Figure
      1F).<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      <b>DISCUSSION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      In the past 3 decades, approved antivirals have increased from a
      few nucleoside analogues to well over 40 drugs [13]. The human
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) epidemics
      particularly drove antiviral discovery toward rationally designed
      drugs targeting specific viral enzymes. Although this approach was
      remarkably effective, the advent of newly emerging or
      drug-resistant viruses that threaten humans calls for the
      development of more broadly active agents targeting viral
      components shared among viruses. N-glycosylation of viral
      envelopes is an important such target shared between influenza,
      HIV, HCV, West Nile virus, SARS-CoV, Hendra virus, Nipah virus,
      and filoviruses (Ebola and Marburg viruses) [7]. To assess one
      possible strategy against N-glycosylated viruses, we tested a
      stringent Ebola virus infection model (3000 × LD50) in mice.<br>
      <br>
      Filovirus infections are characterized by marked lymphopenia,
      severe degeneration of lymphoid tissues, dysregulated dendritic
      cell function, and cytokine storms—all hallmarks of pathogens that
      subvert both innate and adaptive immune responses [14].
      Nevertheless, survivors exhibit detectable virus-specific antibody
      responses [15]. Therefore, we hypothesized that administration of
      a recombinant innate immune molecule that targets glycosylated
      viruses might bridge an infected individual to recovery. Here we
      show for the first time that rhMBL can be used as a therapeutic
      agent to achieve serum concentrations in mice that correspond to
      levels in humans that are 7–24-fold higher than average human
      concentrations and complement cleaving activity that is &gt;5-fold
      higher than baseline values in mice. This result confirms our
      previous in vitro data showing that MBL possesses
      complement-dependent intrinsic antimicrobial activity [2].<br>
      <br>
      Biological responses of the infected mice to rhMBL treatment
      further indicated that our strategy targeted the main pathogenic
      effects of Ebola viruses. MBL-treated mice had higher B lymphocyte
      and CD11b+ granulocyte counts and demonstrated down-regulation of
      intrahepatic proinflammatory (IL-1b and IL-17) and Th2 cytokines
      (IL-5, IL-10, and IL-13) early in the course of infection (Figure
      1E), suggesting that rhMBL may mitigate the detrimental effects of
      the characteristic cytokine storm. MBL-treated mice tended to have
      greater inhibition of viral replication on days 1 and 3 after
      infection (P &gt; .05; Figure 1D). Most important, rhMBL treatment
      bridged surviving mice to development of an effective adaptive
      immune response (Figure 1F). Future experiments will be needed to
      scale high-dose rhMBL therapy for use in larger animal models and
      to test rhMBL in combination with other promising experimental
      therapies such as small molecule inhibitors, coagulation
      modulators, antisense technologies, therapeutic antibodies and
      cytokines, and postexposure vaccination. In summary, we report
      that supraphysiologic rhMBL therapy may be an effective
      immunotherapeutic strategy against Ebola virus, and since Ebola
      glycoproteins potentially model other glycosylated viruses, rhMBL
      therapy may offer a novel broad-spectrum antiviral approach.<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Griffithsin (GRFT), a novel anti-HIV protein, was isolated from an
      aqueous extract of the red alga Griffithsia sp. The 121-amino acid
      sequence of GRFT has been determined, and biologically active GRFT
      was subsequently produced by expression of a corresponding DNA
      sequence in Escherichia coli. Both native and recombinant GRFT
      displayed potent antiviral activity against laboratory strains and
      primary isolates of T- and M- tropic HIV-1 with EC50 values
      ranging from 0.043 to 0.63 nM. GRFT also aborted cell-to-cell
      fusion and transmission of HIV-1 infection at similar
      concentrations. High concentrations (e.g. 783 nM) of GRFT were not
      lethal to any tested host cell types. GRFT blocked CD4-dependent
      glycoprotein (gp) 120 binding to receptor-expressing cells and
      bound to viral coat glycoproteins (gp120, gp41, and gp160) in a
      glycosylation-dependent manner. GRFT preferentially inhibited
      gp120 binding of the monoclonal antibody (mAb) 2G12, which
      recognizes a carbohydrate-dependent motif, and the (mAb) 48d,
      which binds to CD4-induced epitope. In addition, GRFT moderately
      interfered with the binding of gp120 to sCD4. Further data showed
      that the binding of GRFT to soluble gp120 was inhibited by the
      monosaccharides glucose, mannose, and N-acetylglucosamine but not
      by galactose, xylose, fucose, N-acetylgalactosamine, or sialic
      acid-containing glycoproteins. Taken together these data suggest
      that GRFT is a new type of lectin that binds to various viral
      glycoproteins in a monosaccharide-dependent manner. GRFT could be
      a potential candidate microbicide to prevent the sexual
      transmission of HIV and AIDS.<br>

      Inventor: MICHELOW IAN // SCHMIDT EMMETT <br>

      The present invention provides methods of treatment and/or
      prevention of infections, for example, viral and bacterial
      infections, in individuals, wherein the method comprises
      administering a supraphysiological amount of mannose-binding
      lectin (MLB) and/or ficolin-MBL fusion protein to an individual
      afflicted with an infection or at risk of an infection, such as a
      bacterial or a viral infection. For example, methods for treatment
      and/or prevention of Ebola virus infection are provided.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>[0002] 1. Field of the Invention</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0003] The present invention pertains to the use of subunits and
      oligomers of mannan-binding lectin (MBL) and ficolin-MBL fusion
      proteins for prevention and/or treatment of infections,
      particularly in subjects who have normal and functional MBL serum
      levels.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0004] 2. Background of the Invention</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0005] Infections count for a large part of morbidity and
      mortality in the world. While bacterial infections have been
      tackled by antibiotics and bacteriophages, new treatment methods
      are sorely needed for the growing amount of bacteria that have
      become resistant to these treatments. Viruses are a difficult
      target for treatment in humans and other animals because they use
      animal cells to replicate and spread. While some viral infections
      can be prevented using vaccination or antibody-based therapies,
      several serious and lethal viruses remain currently without
      effective treatment.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] One of such lethal virus family is filoviruses. The two
      most known lethal filoviruses are Ebola and Marburg viruses. Ebola
      and Marburg virus can cause acute, lethal hemorrhagic fevers for
      which no vaccines or effective treatments currently exist. Marburg
      and Ebola envelope glycoproteins consist of glycoprotein 1 (GP1)
      and membrane-bound glycoprotein 2 (GP2) protein that are
      covalently linked by a disulfide bond (Sanchez et al., Proc Natl
      Acad Sci USA 93:3602-3607, 1996). Although the causes of filovirus
      virulence are not well known, there is evidence that glycans on
      the viral glycoproteins play distinct roles in pathogenesis of
      these viruses (Takeda and Kawaoke, Trends Microbiol 9:506-511,
      2001).<br>
      <br>
      [0007] It would be useful to discover and develop new treatments
      for infections, such as viral and bacterial infections that could
      be used in prevention and/or treatment of infections and/or to
      supplement the currently available treatment methods to combat
      infections. In addition, it would be useful to discover new
      treatments for infectious diseases that do not currently have an
      effective treatment method, such as filovirus infection or
      infections by bacteria that have developed resistance to the
      available antibiotics.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0008] The present invention is directed to methods of treatment
      and/or prevention of infections, for example, viral and bacterial
      infections, in individuals, wherein the method comprises
      administering a supraphysiological amount of mannose-binding
      lectin (MLB) or ficolin-MBL fusion protein to an individual
      afflicted with an infection or at risk of infection, such as a
      viral or bacterial infection.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] The invention is based upon a surprising discovery, that an
      infection in an individual with normal MBL serum concentration and
      function, i.e., who has no defect in MBL, can be successfully
      treated or prevented by using supraphysiological amounts of MBL or
      by using ficolin-MBL fusion protein.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] The terms "supraphysiological" or "supraphysiologic" are
      intended to encompass amounts of MBL or ficolin-MBL fusion protein
      that exceed the normal serum concentration of MBL in an
      individual, preferably a human individual. The normal serum
      concentration of MBL can be either measured individually, or
      estimated based upon a normal range or average normal serum
      concentration in humans or particular human populations.
      Typically, the "normal" human serum concentration of MBL is
      considered a concentration in individuals who do not carry genetic
      alterations or mutations that are known to reduce the amount or
      function of MBL in said individual.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] In one embodiment, and all other embodiments described
      herein, one uses amounts of MBL that result in blood concentration
      of &gt;2* to 10* the average human serum concentration, which is
      considered a normal serum concentration. In one embodiment, the
      human average MBL serum concentration is estimated to be about 2
      [mu]g/mL. Accordingly, one can use any amount that results in
      serum concentration of between 4-20 [mu]g/mL. For example, an
      amount that results in serum concentration of about 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,
      9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, or 20 [mu]g/mL In one
      embodiment, similar amounts of ficolin-MBL are used.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] Viral infections that can be prevented, ameliorated/treated
      or cured using the methods of the present invention include, but
      are not limited to, filoviruses, including Ebola and Marburg
      viruses, HIV, influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome
      coronavirus (SARS-CoV), hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus,
      respiratory syncytial virus, and herpes simplex virus.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] Bacterial infections that can be prevented
      ameliorated/treated or cured using the methods of the present
      invention include, but are not limited to Staphylococcus aureus;
      Neisseria meningitidis; Burkholderia multivorans, group B.
      streptococcus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa,
      Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Chlamydia pneumoniae.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] While the methods of the invention can be used for
      treatment and/or prevention of infections in any animal or bird, a
      preferred target individual is human.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] In one embodiment, and all other embodiments described
      herein, the target individual is affected with a bacterium that
      has become resistant to currently available antibiotics. In one
      embodiment, one uses the method of the present invention in
      combination with antibiotics or bacteriophages, or anti-viral
      agents.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] In one embodiment, and all other embodiments described
      herein, the individual is affected with a filovirus, such as Ebola
      or Marburg virus.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] In one embodiment, and all other embodiments described
      herein, the method comprises first selecting a patient who is
      infected with a virus or bacterium, and then administering to the
      selected individual a supraphysiological amount of MLB or
      ficolin-MBL fusion protein.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] In one embodiment, and all other embodiments described
      herein, the individual affected with, exposed to or susceptible to
      be exposed to an infection, such as bacterial or viral infection
      does not have a congenital or acquired MBL deficiency. In one
      embodiment, and all other embodiments described herein, one first
      determines if the individual has a congenital or acquired MBL
      deficiency. If the individual does not have such a deficiency, the
      individual can be administered a supraphysiological amount of MBL
      or ficolin-MBL fusion protein as a treatment or preventive measure
      to fight a viral infection or a suspected viral infection or
      exposure to an environment likely to carry viruses, such as an
      Ebola virus.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] MBL can be purified from natural sources or from material
      produced by recombinant technologies, or by any other suitable
      MBL-producing cell line, for the prophylaxis and/or treatment of
      infections. Preparations and pharmaceutical compositions of MBL
      are known. In one embodiment, one uses the MBL as described in
      U.S. Pat. No. 5,270,199, which is herein incorporated by reference
      in its entirety. Also preparations and pharmaceutical compositions
      of ficolin-MBL fusion proteins are known. In one embodiment, one
      uses ficolin-MBL chimeric proteins described in, e.g., U.S. Patent
      Application Publication No. 20060188963. In one embodiment, one
      uses SEQ ID NO: 1 to produce MBL. Ficolin sequences, for example
      SEQ ID NO: 3, and SEQ ID NO: 8 can be used to make constructs for
      recombinantly producing various ficolin-MBL fusion proteins.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] One aspect of the invention relates to treatment and/or
      prophylaxis of infections in individuals affected with a viral or
      bacterial infection using supraphysiological amount of MBL or
      ficolin-MBL fusion protein. In one embodiment, the individuals are
      not immunocompromised.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] Without wishing to be bound by a theory, we believe that
      MBL exerts its antimicrobial activity mainly through its
      opsonizing activity (preparation of microorganisms for
      phagocytosis). This activity is dependent on activation of
      complement after binding of MBL to the microbial surface and
      deposition of C4b and C3b on the microorganism. MBL can also
      promote direct complement-mediated killing of the microorganism
      through an activation of the terminal lytic pathway of complement
      and insertion of the membrane attack complex (MAC) in the
      membrane. Without wishing to be bound by a theory, this mechanism
      is considered of minor importance. Many microorganisms, such as
      Gram-positive bacteria, e.g., Streptococcus pneumonia, are
      resistant to MAC, but can be eliminated by opsonophagocytosis. The
      inhibition of infection may be mediated by MBL directly
      neutralizing the pathogen, enhancing uptake by phagocytic cells
      that eliminate the infection, or by killing the pathogens by
      activation of the complement protein pathway.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] Because the MBL is normally present at physiological
      amounts in individuals who do not have congenital defects in it or
      who are not immunocompromised, it was surprising that one can
      exert a virus dose reducing effect by administering additional,
      supraphysiological amount of MBL into such an individual.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] In another aspect, the present invention relates to the use
      of a composition comprising at least one mannan-binding lectin
      (MBL) subunit, or at least one oligomer comprising the at least
      one mannan-binding lectin (MBL) subunit, in the manufacture of a
      medicament for prophylactic, ameliorating or curative treatment of
      an infection, including a viral or bacterial infection, in an
      individual initially having plasma levels of MBL of about 5
      [mu]g/mL. In one embodiment, the individual is not genetically
      disposed to an MBL deficiency or does not have acquired MBL
      deficiency.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] Accordingly, in one embodiment, the methods are used as
      prophylaxis for individuals who are likely to be exposed, or who
      have already been exposed to viruses and/or bacteria, but do not
      yet have symptoms of infection, wherein the presence of
      supraphysiological amount of MBL or ficolin-MBL will prevent
      infection or ameliorate symptoms of an infection.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] In one embodiment, the invention provides a method of
      preventing a filovirus infection by administering a
      supraphysiological dose of MBL or ficolin-MBL fusion protein to an
      individual who is likely to be exposed to a filovirus. In one
      embodiment, the filovirus is Ebola virus. In one embodiment, the
      filovirus is Marburg virus.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] In one embodiment, the invention provides use of MBL or
      ficolin-MBL fusion protein as a medicament for treatment of
      infections, particularly viral and bacterial infections, in
      amounts that are supraphysiological.<br>

      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>[0033] FIG. 7 shows a C4 deposition assay. The C4
        deposition assay is an ELISA-based functional assay that
        measures the relative capacities of MBL or the chimeric protein
        to bind human C4. Mannan (10 ug/mL) is coated on a 96-well ELISA
        plate, blocked with BSA, and incubated with varying
        concentrations of rhMBL or chimeric proteins. Human C4 (10
        ug/mL) is then added and detected with biotin-streptavidin
        conjugated antibodies. FCN-MBL76 had significantly greater C4
        binding activity compared with rhMBL and the other chimerics.
        This result suggests that FCN-MBL76 has greater complement
        pathway activating capacity which may result in enhanced
        pathogen lysis or neutralization.</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>[0034] FIG. 8 shows calreticulin binding assay. The 96-well
        ELISA plate was coated with rhMBL or chimeric proteins (10
        ug/mL), blocked with BSA and incubated with 5 ug/mL biotinylated
        human placental calreticulin that was measured at absorbance
        O.D. 405. FCN-MBL76 bound to human placental calreticulin
        significantly better than rhMBL or the other chimeric proteins.
        This may have important implications for the relative functions
        of the proteins because calreticulin is the putative cellular
        receptor on phagocytes for native MBL and therefore, enhanced
        binding of the chimeric molecule may result in improved pathogen
        clearance by opsonophagocytosis.</b><b><br>

        without an envelope (HIV-env neg; solid square) or with an

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0042] The present invention is directed to methods and uses of
      MBL and ficolin-MBL fusion proteins for the treatment of
      infections.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] The innate immune system that defends humans from
      infections is comprised of a network of recognition and effector
      molecules that act together to protect the host in the first
      minutes or hours of exposure to an infectious challenge.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] The mannan-binding lectin (MBL), synonymous to
      mannose-binding lectin, mannan-binding protein or mannose-binding
      protein (MBP), is an evolutionarily conserved circulating host
      defense protein that acts as a broad spectrum recognition molecule
      against a wide variety of infectious agents (see, e.g., review by
      Takahashi et al. Current Opinion in Immunology 18:16-23, 2006).<br>
      <br>
      [0045] Several groups of lectins, i.e., carbohydrate-binding
      proteins, are known in humans. One group is the C-type lectins.
      The C-type lectins contain a calcium-dependent carbohydrate
      recognition domain (a C-type CRD)(Weis W I, et al. Immunological
      Reviews 163: 19-34, 1998). MBL belongs to the subgroup of C-type
      lectins, termed collectins, since these soluble proteins are
      composed of subunits presenting three CRDs attached to a
      collagenous stalk (Holmskov, U., et al., Immunol. Today 15:67-74,
      1994). MBL interacts with carbohydrates presented by a wide range
      of micro-organisms playing an important role in the innate immune
      defense (Turner, M. W. Immunol. Today 17:532-540, 1996 and
      Takahashi et al., Current Opinion in Immunology, 18:16-23, 2006).
      When bound to carbohydrate MBL is able to activate the complement
      system.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] The complement system may be activated via three different
      pathways: the classical pathway, the alternative pathway, and the
      third pathway, the mannan-binding lectin (MBL) pathway, which is
      initiated by the binding of MBL to carbohydrates presented by
      micro-organisms. The components of the alternative pathway and of
      the MBL pathway are parts of the innate immune defense, also
      termed the natural or the non-clonal, immune defense, while the
      classical pathway involves cooperation with antibodies of the
      specific immune defense (Janeway C A, Travers P, Walport M and
      Capra J D, 1999, Immunobiology, the immune system in health and
      disease, Fourth Edition, Churchill Livingstone).<br>
      <br>
      [0047] The human MBL protein is composed of up to 18 identical 32
      kDa polypeptide chains (Lu, J., et al., (1990) J. Immunol.
      144:2287-2294), each comprising a short N-terminal segment of 21
      amino acids including three cysteine residues, followed by 7
      repeats of the collagenous motif Gly-X-Y interrupted by a Gln
      residues followed by another 12 Gly-X-Y repeats. A small 34
      residue 'neck-region' joins the C-terminal Ca&lt;2+&gt;-dependent
      lectin domain of 93 amino acids with the collagenous part of the
      molecule (Sastry, K., et al., (1989) J. Exp. Med. 170:1175-1189).<br>
      <br>
      [0048] The collagenous regions of the three polypeptide chains
      combine to form a subunit which is stabilized covalently by
      disulphide bridges. Individual subunits are joined by disulphide
      bridges as well as by non-covalent interactions (Lu, J., et al.,
      J. Immunol. 144:2287-2294, 1990).<br>
      <br>
      [0049] The position of these disulphide bridges has, however, not
      been fully resolved. SDS-PAGE analysis under non-reducing
      conditions of MBL shows bands with an apparent molecular weight
      (m.w.) larger than 200 kDa presumably representing blocks of 3, 4,
      5 and even 6 assembled subunits (Lu, J., et al., J. Immunol.
      144:2287-2294, 1990).<br>
      <br>
      [0050] The actual number of subunits in the natural human MBL
      protein has been controversial. Lipscombe et al. (1995) obtained
      data by use of ultracentrifugation suggesting 25% of human serum
      MBL to be made of 2-3 subunits and only a minor fraction reaching
      the size of 6 subunits (Lipscombe, R. J., et al., Immunology
      85:660-667, 1995). The relative quantification was carried out by
      densitometry of Western blots developed by chemiluminescence (Lu,
      J., et al., J. Immunol. 144:2287-2294, 1990) found by SDS-PAGE
      analysis of fractions from ion exchange chromatography that the
      predominant species of covalently linked MBL subunit chains
      consisted of tetramers while only pentameric or hexameric
      complexes activated complement. Gel permeation chromatography
      (GPC) analysis, in contrast, suggests that MBL is comparable in
      size with the C1 complex. GPC can be carried out under conditions
      which allow for a study of the importance of weak protein-protein
      interactions in the formation of MBL molecules. MBL content in the
      GPC fractions can be determined by standard MBL assay techniques.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] MBL is synthesized in the liver by hepatocytes and secreted
      into the blood. It binds to carbohydrate structures on bacteria,
      yeast, parasitic protozoa and viruses, and exhibits antibacterial
      activity through killing of the microorganisms by activation of
      the terminal, lytic complement components or through promotion of
      phagocytosis (opsonization). The sertiform structure of MBL is
      quite similar to the bouquet-like structure of C1q, the
      immunoglobulin-binding subcomponent of the first component in the
      classical pathway (Turner, M. W. Mannose-binding lectin: the
      pluripotent molecule of the innate immune system. Immunol. Today
      17:532-540, 1996). C1q is associated with two serine proteases,
      C1r and C1s, to form the C1 complex. Similarly, MBL is associated
      with two serine proteases MASP-1 (Matsushita, M. and Fujita, T, J.
      Exp. Med. 176:1497-1502, 1992) and MASP-2 (Thiel S, et al.,
      Nature, 386(6624): 506-510, 1997), and an additional protein
      called Map19 (Stover C M, et al., J Immunol 162: 3481-3490, 1999).
      MASP-1 and MASP-2 have modular structures identical to those of
      C1r and C1s (Thiel S, et al., Nature, 386(6624): 506-510, 1997).
      The binding of MBL to carbohydrates induces the activation of
      MASP-1 and MASP-2. MASP-2 then generates the C3 convertase, C4b2a,
      through cleavage of C4 and C2. Reports suggest that MASP-1 may
      activate C3 directly. Nothing is known about the stoichiometry and
      activation sequence of the MBL/MASP complexes. MBL has also been
      characterized in other animals such as rodents, cattle, chicken
      and monkeys.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] Based on presence and function of MBL in at least rodents,
      cattle, chicken and monkeys, in addition to humans, makes the
      methods of the present invention applicable to at least these
      animals as well.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] Human mannose-binding protein has been disclosed in U.S.
      Pat. No. 5,270,199. Moreover, use of MBL in treatment of
      immunocompromised individuals has been described (U.S. Pat. Nos.
      6,562,784 and 7,202,207, and U.S. Patent Application Publication
      No. 2007-0197428). However, because MBL is a naturally occurring
      molecule present in the serum, no one has suggested its use in
      treatment or prevention of infections in individuals with normal
      serum concentration of MBL. Our discovery that supraphysiological
      amounts of MBL can increase the infection fighting capacity of an
      individual with normal MBL concentrations and function was thus
      surprising.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] Accordingly, one aspect of the invention provides a method
      for prevention and treatment of infections in individuals, such as
      human individuals, comprising administering to said individual a
      supraphysiological amount of MBL.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] The term "supraphysiological" as used in the present
      application means amounts greater than the physiological amount
      normally present in an individual or greater than minimal
      concentration of MBL required to activate a complement, i.e. to
      bind to C4. Similar concentrations of ficolin-MBL fusion proteins
      can also be used.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] In one embodiment, one uses MBL and/or ficolin-MBL fusion
      proteins or combinations thereof in the amount that results in the
      amount of about 2-10 times greater than the physiological amount
      of MBL in an individual. In one embodiment, one uses, for example,
      2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 times greater than the physiological
      amount in the individual. In one embodiment, the average
      physiological amount is considered about 2 [mu]g/mL. In one
      embodiment, one first determines the physiological amount of MBL
      in an individual prior to administering MBL or ficolin-MBL fusion
      protein composition to said individual. This is particularly
      useful when using MBL or ficolin-MBL as a prophylaxis for
      individuals who will be at risk of encountering infective agents,
      such as medical personnel or armed forces who may be a target for
      a biological attack.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] The concentration of MBL in human serum is largely
      genetically determined, but reportedly increases up to threefold
      during acute phase infection reactions (Thiel S, et al., Clin Exp
      Immunol 90: 31-35, 1992). Three mutations causing structural
      alterations and two mutations in the promotor region are
      associated with MBL deficiency (Madsen, H. O., et al.,
      Immunogenetics 40:37-44, 1994). MBL deficiency is associated with
      susceptibility to a variety of infections (Summerfield J A, et
      al., Lancet 345: 886-889, 1995; Garred P, et al., Lancet 346:
      941-943, 1995).<br>
      <br>
      [0058] It has been estimated that the average physiological amount
      of MBL in human serum is about 2 [mu]g/mL. Accordingly, in one
      embodiment, one uses the average physiological amount as the
      physiological amount, and consequently, the supraphysiological
      amount of MBL or ficolin-MBL according to the present invention is
      about 2-10 times above the average physiological MBL level.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] In one embodiment, one takes into account the impact of MBL
      haplotypes when considering the physiological serum MBL
      concentrations. At least ten distinct MBL haplotypes have been
      described in human, four of which (LYPB, LYQC, HYPD and LXPA)
      dictate low serum MBL concentrations (Madsen et al. J Immunol
      161:3169-3175, 1998; Takahashi et al., Current Opinion in
      Immunology 18:16-23, 2006). Human populations from diverse
      geographic locations and ethnic and genetic backgrounds have
      higher rate of haplotype variation, with a rate of heterozygosity
      from 15% in white populations to 30% in certain African
      populations. Accordingly, in one embodiment, to establish the
      physiological serum MBL level to adjust the amount of MBL used in
      the methods of the present invention, one correlates the level of
      MBL with a functional measurement of the MBL:MASP pathway
      (Takahashi et al., Current Opinion in Immunology 18:16-23, 2006;
      Petersen et al., J Immunol Methods 257:107-116, 2001).
      Accordingly, if the average serum concentration of MBL in a
      particular individual or population is higher, the
      supraphysiologic dosage is adjusted accordingly. Similarly, if the
      average serum concentration of MBL is lower, a lower amount is
      needed for the treatment of prevention of infections. A skilled
      artisan is easily able to make these determinations based on the
      description herein.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] A wide range of oligosaccharides can bind to MBL. As the
      target sugars are not normally exposed on mammalian cell surfaces
      at high densities, MBL does not usually recognize
      self-determinants, but is well suited to interactions with
      microbial cell surfaces presenting repetitive carbohydrate
      determinants. In vitro, yeast (Candida albicans and Cryptococcus
      neoformans), viruses (HIV-1, HIV-2, HSV-2, and various types of
      influenza A) and a number of bacteria have been shown to be
      recognized by MBL. In the case of some bacteria, the binding with
      MBL is impaired by the presence of a capsule (van Emmerik, L C, et
      al., Clin.Exp.Immunol. 97:411-416, 1994). However, even
      encapsulated bacteria (Neisseria meningitidis) can show strong
      binding of MBL (Jack D L, et al., J Immunol 160: 1346-1353, 1998),
      and is thus one target infection according to the present
      invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] The microorganisms, which infect MBL deficient individuals,
      represent many different species of bacterial, viral and fungal
      origin (Summerfield J A, et al., BioMed J 314: 1229-1232, 1997;
      Miller, M. E., et al., Lancet: 60-63, 1968; Super, M., et al.,
      Lancet 2:1236-1239, 1989; and Nielsen, S. L., et al., Clin. Exp.
      Immunol. 100:219-222, 1995). Deficiency is also associated with
      habitual abortions (Christiansen, O. B., et al., Scand. J.
      Immunol., 49, 193-196, 1999). Indeed, MBL appears to be a general
      defense molecule against most bacteria, and thus be considered as
      one reason why so many bacteria are non-pathogenic.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] Accordingly, in one embodiment, the methods of the
      invention pertain to prevention and/or treatment of infections
      caused by any of the foregoing infective agents, including
      viruses, yeast, fungus, and bacteria.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] While accumulating data support the notion of a protective
      effect of MBL there are also observations suggesting that
      infections with some microorganisms, notably intracellular
      pathogens, attain a higher frequency in MBL sufficient than in MBL
      deficient individuals (Garred, P, et al., Eur. J. Immunogen.
      21:125-131, 1994; Hoal-Van Helden E G, et al., Pediatr Res
      45:459-64, 1999). This is in concordance with the results of an
      animal experiment, where an increased number of HSV-2 were found
      in the liver of mice pre-injected with human MBL (Fischer, P B, et
      al., Scand J Immunol 39:439-445, 1994). Our results contradict
      these findings by showing a strong protective and treatment effect
      of administering to a subject a supraphysiological amount of MBL
      and/or ficolin-MBL fusion proteins or combinations thereof.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] Clinical grade MBL has been obtained from blood donor
      plasma and shown to be safe upon infusion (Valdimarsson, H., M. et
      al., Scand. J. Immunol. 48:116-123, 1998). Accordingly, one can
      use such preparations in the methods of the present invention.
      Similarly, one can make recombinant MBL using any well known gene
      expression system.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] Ficolins, like MBL, are lectins that contain a
      collagen-like domain. However, unlike MBL, they have a
      fibrinogen-like domain, which is similar to fibrinogen beta- and
      gamma-chains. Ficolin also forms oligomers of structural subunits,
      each of which is composed of three identical 35 kDa polypeptides.
      Each subunit is composed of an amino-terminal, cysteine-rich
      region; a collagen-like domain that consists of tandem repeats of
      Gly-Xaa-Yaa triplet sequences (where Xaa and Yaa represent any
      amino acid); a neck region; and a fibrinogen-like domain. The
      oligomers of ficolins comprise two or more subunits, especially a
      tetrameric form of ficolin has been observed.<br>
      <br>
      [0066] Some of the ficolins trigger an activation of the
      complement system substantially in similar way as done by MBL.
      This triggering of the complement system results in the activation
      of novel serine proteases (MASPs).<br>
      <br>
      [0067] The fibrinogen-like domain of several lectins has a similar
      function to the CRD of C-type lectins including MBL, and function
      as pattern-recognition receptors to discriminate pathogens from
      self.<br>
      <br>
      [0068] Serum ficolins have a common binding specificity for GlcNAc
      (N-acetyl-glucosamine), elastin or GalNAc
      (N-acetyl-galactosamine). The fibrinogen-like domain is
      responsible for the carbohydrate binding. In human serum, two
      types of ficolin, known as L-ficolin (also called P35, ficolin L,
      ficolin 2 or hucolin) and H-ficolin (also called Hakata antigen,
      ficolin 3 or thermolabile b2-macroglycoprotein), have been
      identified, and both of them have lectin activity. L-ficolin
      recognises GlcNAc and H-ficolin recognises GalNAc. Another ficolin
      known as M-ficolin (also called P35-related protein, ficolin 1 or
      ficolin A) is not considered to be a serum protein and is found in
      leucocytes and in the lungs. L-ficolin and H-ficolin activate the
      lectin-complement pathway in association with MASPs. M-Ficolin,
      L-ficolin and H-ficolin has calcium-independent lectin activity.<br>
      <br>
      [0069] Accordingly, in one embodiment, the invention provides
      methods of prevention and/or treatment of infectious diseases
      using MBL-L-ficolin or MBL-H-ficolin fusion proteins, or a
      combination thereof.<br>
      <br>
      [0070] Naturally, one can also use a combination of MBL and
      MBL-ficolin, such as MBL-L-ficolin and/or MBL-H-ficolin.<br>
      <br>
      [0071] Chimeric molecules of MBL and ficolin have been described,
      for example, in U.S. Patent Application Publication No.
      2006-0188963. Although it has been suggested that the chimeric
      molecules could be used to prevent and/or treat infections in
      patients having clinical symptoms associated with congenital or
      acquired MBL deficiency or being at risk of developing such
      symptoms (Id.), no one has proposed or shown that individuals with
      normal MBL activity would benefit from additional,
      supraphysiological amounts of MBL or MBL-ficolin in combating
      infectious diseases.<br>
      <br>
      [0072] Based on our findings, the present invention provides a
      novel method for treatment or prevention of infections in an
      individual having normal expression and normal function of MBL.<br>
      <br>
      [0073] In addition, fusion proteins useful according to the
      methods of the invention can designed in such a way as to test
      whether the source of the MASP-binding site and flanking
      sequences, and presence of the "kink" from MBL affect ligand
      binding activity and/or complement activation. Without wishing to
      be bound by a theory, we designed the proteins in the examples
      based on the assumption that differences at these sites alter the
      protein conformational structure which in turn alters
      protein-protein interactions. Therefore any differences in protein
      activity can assist in understanding the functional parts of the
      molecules. We discovered that FCN-MBL76 has a greater activity in
      various assays. Without wishing to be bound by a theory, we
      concluded that is because of differences in spatial orientation of
      the CRDs. We have shown that FCN-MBL76 binds the best to a sugar,
      mannan.<br>
      <br>
      [0074] Examples of useful fusion proteins are presented in FIG. 3.
      In our test molecules, FCN-MBL126 has only the carbohydrate
      recognition domain (CRD) from MBL and the rest includes the
      MASP-binding site. The amino-terminus is from L-FCN.<br>
      <br>
      [0075] FCN-MBL76 has the CRD, neck and part of the flanking
      sequences of the MASP-binding site from MBL; the lysine and other
      flanking sequences of the MASP-binding site, and the
      amino-terminal is from L-FCN.<br>
      <br>
      [0076] FCN-MBL64 has the CRD, neck, MASP-binding site and flanking
      sequences and the "kink" from MBL; the amino-terminal is from
      L-FCN.<br>
      <br>
      [0077] In one embodiment, one uses a fusion protein which includes
      the signal peptide from L-FCN because this component is important
      to signal the protein to be transported from the cytosol to the
      endoplasmic reticulum for packaging and secretion.<br>
      <br>
      [0078] Accordingly, based on the description herein and throughout
      this specification and examples, a skilled artisan can design
      various fusion proteins, including proteins with
      stability-increasing modifications using routine methods.<br>
      <br>
      [0079] In certain embodiments, the methods of the present
      invention include treatment and/or prevention of infections
      including bacterial, viral and fungal infections. The viral
      infections according to the present invention can be caused by any
      virus, such as viruses including but not limited to the viruses of
      the herpes family, such as Herpes Simpex I, Herpes Simplex II,
      Human Herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6), herpes zoster; poxviruses; corona
      viruses; paramyxoviruses; and togaviruses, HIV, Ebola, and the
      like.<br>
      <br>
      [0080] In certain embodiments, the methods of the present
      invention provide for treatment of bacterial infections and/or
      preventing bacterial infection for bacteria such as Staphylococcus
      spp., Streptococcus spp., Escherichia spp., Enterococcus spp.,
      Pseudomonas spp. bacteria and combinations thereof, and more
      particularly Staphylococcus aureus, including antibiotic resistant
      strains such as methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus,
      Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli (E. coli),
      Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pseudomonasae), Streptococcus pyogenes,
      and combinations thereof.<br>
      <br>
      [0081] In certain embodiments, the method of the present invention
      provide treatment and/or prevention for infections caused by
      Staphylococcus aureus; Neisseria meningitidis; Burkholderia
      multivorans, group B streptococcus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas
      aeruginosa, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Chlamydia pneumoniae.<br>
      <br>
      [0082] In one embodiment, the method of the present invention
      provide treatment and/or prevention for infections caused by HIV,
      influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
      SARS-CoV), hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, respiratory
      syncytial virus, herpes simplex virus, or filovirus, for example
      Ebola or Marburg virus.<br>
      <br>
      [0083] A medicament comprising MBL and/or MBL-ficolin fusion
      protein, may be produced by using the eluant obtained from the
      affinity chromatography as such. It is however preferred that the
      eluant is subjected to further purification steps before being
      used in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.<br>
      <br>
      [0084] In one embodiment, the composition or medicament consists
      essentially of MBL and/or MBL-ficolin fusion protein or
      functional, i.e. infectious agents binding derivatives thereof in
      a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.<br>
      <br>
      [0085] In addition to the MBL oligomers or ficolin-MBL fusion
      proteins, the medicament may comprise a pharmaceutically
      acceptable carrier substance and/or vehicles. In particular, a
      stabilizing agent may be added to stabilize the MBL proteins or
      the ficolin-MBL fusion proteins. The stabilizing agent may be a
      sugar alcohol, saccharides, proteins and/or amino acids. Examples
      of stabilizing agents are maltose or albumin.<br>
      <br>
      [0086] The term "derivative" as used herein refers to MBL or
      ficolin-MBL fusion proteins which are functional in the sense that
      they can bind infectious agents but have also have been chemically
      modified, for example but not limited to by techniques such as
      ubiquitination, labeling, pegylation (derivatization with
      polyethylene glycol, PEG) or addition of other molecules. A
      molecule also a "derivative" of another molecule when it contains
      additional chemical moieties not normally a part of the molecule.
      Such moieties can improve the molecule's solubility, absorption,
      biological half life, etc. The moieties can alternatively decrease
      the toxicity of the molecule, eliminate or attenuate any
      undesirable side effect of the molecule, etc. Moieties capable of
      mediating such effects are disclosed in Remington's Pharmaceutical
      Sciences, 18th edition, A. R. Gennaro, Ed., MackPubl., Easton, Pa.

      Acad Sci 663:48-62 (1992).).<br>
      <br>
      [0087] In one embodiment, the MBL and/or ficolin-MBL fusion
      protein is fused to a second fusion partner, such as a carrier
      molecule to enhance its bioavailability. Such carriers are known
      in the art and include poly (alkyl) glycol such as poly ethylene
      glycol (PEG). Fusion to serum albumin can also increase the serum
      half-life of therapeutic polypeptides.<br>
      <br>
      [0088] The MBL and/or ficolin MBL fusion polypeptide can also be
      fused to a second fusion partner, for example, to a polypeptide
      that targets the product to a desired location, or, for example, a
      tag that facilitates its purification, if so desired. Tags and
      fusion partners can be designed to be cleavable, if so desired.
      Another modification specifically contemplated is attachment,
      e.g., covalent attachment, to a polymer. In one aspect, polymers
      such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) or methoxypolyethylene glycol
      (mPEG) can increase the in vivo half-life of proteins to which
      they are conjugated. Methods of PEGylation of polypeptide agents
      are well known to those skilled in the art, as are considerations
      of, for example, how large a PEG polymer to use.<br>
      <br>
      [0089] As used herein, the term "conjugate" or "conjugation"
      refers to the attachment of two or more entities to form one
      entity. For example, the methods of the present invention provide
      conjugation of a MBL or ficolin-MBL fusion polypeptide or
      fragments, derivatives or variants thereof, joined with another
      entity, for example a moiety such as a first fusion partner that
      makes the MBL or ficolin-MBL fusion protein stable, such as Ig
      carrier particle, for example IgG1 Fc. The attachment can be by
      means of linkers, chemical modification, peptide linkers, chemical
      linkers, covalent or non-covalent bonds, or protein fusion or by
      any means known to one skilled in the art. The joining can be
      permanent or reversible. In some embodiments, several linkers can
      be included in order to take advantage of desired properties of
      each linker and each protein in the conjugate. Flexible linkers
      and linkers that increase the solubility of the conjugates are
      contemplated for use alone or with other linkers as disclosed
      herein. Peptide linkers can be linked by expressing DNA encoding
      the linker to one or more proteins in the conjugate. Linkers can
      be acid cleavable, photocleavable and heat sensitive linkers.
      Methods for conjugation are well known by persons skilled in the
      art and are encompassed for use in the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0090] According to the present invention, the MBL or ficolin-MBL
      fusion polypeptide or fragments, derivatives or variants thereof,
      can be linked to the first fusion partner via any suitable means,
      as known in the art, see for example U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,625,014,
      5,057,301 and 5, 514,363, which are incorporated herein in their
      entirety by reference. For example, the MBL or ficolin-MBL fusion
      polypeptide can be covalently conjugated to the IgG1 Fc, either
      directly or through one or more linkers. In one embodiment, a MBL
      or ficolin-MBL fusion polypeptide as disclosed herein is
      conjugated directly to the first fusion partner (e.g. Fc), and in
      an alternative embodiment, a MBL or ficolin-MBL fusion polypeptide
      as disclosed herein can be conjugated to a first fusion partner
      (such as IgG1 Fc) via a linker, e.g. a transport enhancing linker.<br>
      <br>
      [0091] As used herein, the term "treating" includes reducing or
      alleviating at least one adverse effect or symptom of an
      infection. Accordingly, the anti-viral medicament according to the
      present invention may be a medicament capable of virus attenuation
      and/or elimination. Similarly, antibacterial medicament according
      to the present invention may be a medicament capable of
      stabilizing the bacterial infection and/or eliminating such an
      infection.<br>
      <br>
      [0092] The MBL or ficolin-MBL fusion protein can be administered
      by any appropriate route which results in an effective treatment
      of an infection in the subject. In one embodiment, the
      administration is performed systemically.<br>
      <br>
      [0093] In one embodiment, one administers the MBL or ficolin-MBL
      fusion proteins enterally, topically or parenterally. The phrases
      "parenteral administration" and "administered parenterally" as
      used herein means modes of administration other than enteral and
      topical administration, usually by injection, and includes,
      without limitation, intravenous, intramuscular, intraarterial,
      intrathecal, intraventricular, intracapsular, intraorbital,
      intracardiac, intradermal, intraperitoneal, transtracheal,
      subcutaneous, subcuticular, intraarticular, sub capsular,
      subarachnoid, intraspinal, intracerebro spinal, and infrasternal
      injection and infusion. The phrases "systemic administration,"
      "administered systemically", "peripheral administration" and
      "administered peripherally" as used herein mean the administration
      of MBL and/or ficolin-MBL fusion protein other than directly into
      the central nervous system, such that it enters the animal's
      system and, thus, is subject to metabolism and other like
      processes, for example, subcutaneous administration.<br>
      <br>
      [0094] The phrase "pharmaceutically acceptable" is employed herein
      to refer to those compounds, materials, compositions, and/or
      dosage forms which are, within the scope of sound medical
      judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of human
      beings and animals without excessive toxicity, irritation,
      allergic response, or other problem or complication, commensurate
      with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio.<br>
      <br>
      [0095] The phrase "pharmaceutically acceptable carrier" as used
      herein means a pharmaceutically acceptable material, composition
      or vehicle, such as a liquid or solid filler, diluent, excipient,
      solvent or encapsulating material, involved in carrying or
      transporting the subject agents from one organ, or portion of the
      body, to another organ, or portion of the body. Each carrier must
      be "acceptable" in the sense of being compatible with the other
      ingredients of the formulation.<br>
      <br>
      [0096] Other conventional additives may be added to the medicament
      depending on administration form for example. In one embodiment
      the medicament is in a form suitable for injections. Conventional
      carrier substances, such as isotonic saline, may be used.<br>
      <br>
      [0097] In another embodiment the pharmaceutical composition or
      medicament is in a form suitable for pulmonal administration, such
      as in the form of a powder for inhalation or cream or fluid for
      topical application.<br>
      <br>
      [0098] The route of administration may be any suitable route, such
      as intravenously, intramusculary, intraperitoneally, subcutanously
      or intradermally. Also, pulmonal or topical administration is
      envisaged by the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0099] The MBL composition may also be administered
      simultaneously, sequentially or separately with another
      anti-bacterial, anti-viral or viral or bacterial infection symptom
      alleviating treatment.<br>
      <br>
      [0100] The MBL and/or ficolin-MBL composition is administered in
      suitable dosage regimes, in particular, it is administered
      repeatedly at suitable intervals, such as once or twice a week.
      For example, one can start before exposure to the virus and
      maintain the periodic administration at intervals, for example 1,
      2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 times a week, or, for example, 1, 2, 3, or 4
      times a day, at least during a part of the exposure or suspected
      exposure of the individual to the virus. One can also begin
      administering the MBL composition at the time of suspected
      exposure and continue with periodic additional dosages for at
      least 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 days or even longer. One can also begin
      the treatment at the onset of the symptoms of the infection, such
      a viral infection and continue the periodic administration of at
      least one additional dosages until the symptoms begin to diminish
      or until there are no symptoms, or until at least 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
      6, 7 days after the symptoms have disappeared.<br>
      <br>
      [0101] In one embodiment, the invention provides a method wherein
      recombinant human MBL is administered every 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
      8, 9, 10 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, or 24
      hours. In one embodiment, one administers recombinant human MBL
      every 12 hours.<br>
      <br>
      [0102] The use of an MBL or ficolin-MBL fusion protein composition
      may also be in a kit-of-parts further comprising another
      medicament, such as an anti-fungal, anti-yeast, anti-bacterial
      and/or anti-viral medicament.<br>
      <br>
      [0103] Accordingly, in one embodiment, the invention provides a
      method for treatment and/or prevention of an infection in an
      individual comprising administering to said individual a
      supraphysiological amount of mannose-binding lectin (MBL) or
      ficolin-MBL fusion protein or a combination thereof and a
      pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In one embodiment, the
      infection is a viral infection. In one embodiment, the viral
      infection is an Ebola virus infection. In another embodiment, the
      infection is a bacterial infection.<br>
      <br>
      [0104] In one embodiment the supraphysiological amount is an
      amount that results in blood concentrations of the MBL or the
      ficolin-MBL fusion protein at about 2-10 times the average
      physiological MBL serum concentration. In one embodiment, the
      average physiological MBL serum concentration is about 2 [mu]g/mL.<br>
      <br>
      [0105] In one aspect of the invention and all other aspects
      described herein, the invention provides use of supraphysiological
      amount of mannose-binding lectin (MBL) or ficolin-MBL fusion
      protein for treatment and/or prevention of an infection. In one
      embodiment, the infection is a viral infection. In one embodiment,
      the viral infection is an Ebola virus infection. In another
      embodiment, the infection is a bacterial infection.<br>
      <br>
      [0106] In one aspect of the invention and all other aspects
      described herein, the invention provides, one uses MBL2, SEQ ID
      NO: 2, SEQ ID NO: 5, SEQ ID NO: 6 and/or SEQ ID NO: 7, or
      combinations thereof in the methods of the invention. A skilled
      artisan can create alternative protein variants and fusion
      proteins for the use in the methods of the present invention using
      routine gene manipulation techniques and sequences available in
      public and proprietary databases alike.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLES</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0107] We have developed novel immunotherapeutic agents that
      effectively prevent and treat infections, such as life-threatening
      infections, like infections caused by Ebola (EBOV) or Marburg
      viruses. In our experiments we used Ebola viruses as examples.
      However, based on our discovery, any other viral or bacterial
      infection can be treated using similar methods.<br>
      <br>
      [0108] Ebola viruses are filamentous, enveloped, non-segmented,
      negative-strand RNA viruses. EBOV subspecies Zaire and Sudan are
      highly pathogenic in humans and cause as high as 90% mortality in
      outbreaks in equatorial Africa. There are no FDA-approved vaccines
      or therapeutic agents available to prevent or treat EBOV.<br>
      <br>
      [0109] MBL is a broad-spectrum ligand-specific C-type lectin that
      plays an important role in innate immunity by acting as an opsonin
      and by activating the lectin complement pathway. Preliminary data
      indicated that recombinant human MBL (rhMBL) 1) binds high-mannose
      residues in EBOV envelope glycoproteins (GP) which are the
      principal virulence and immunogenic determinants of EBOV, and
      Holmskov, U., et al., Immunol. Today 15:67-74, 1994) inhibits
      experimental EBOV infection in a complement-dependent manner
      manner (Ji X et al. J Gen Virol 2005; 86:2535-42). These
      observations strongly support rhMBL's role as a novel
      immunotherapeutic agent for EBOV.<br>
      <br>
      [0110] We also tested three chimeric proteins (FCN-MBL) comprising
      varying lengths of the carboxy terminal of MBL and the collagen
      stalk of L-ficolin, another lectin-like protein that activates the
      lectin complement pathway (see FIGS. 3 and 3).<br>
      <br>
      [0111] RhMBL and FCN-MBL chimeras have comparable ligand-binding
      specificity but FCN-MBL has a simpler multimeric structure and
      different functional characteristics, and rhMBL reduces mortality
      in a mouse model of native EBOV Zaire infection.<br>
      <br>
      [0112] Clinical grade rhMBL was provided by ENZON Pharmaceuticals,
      NJ.<br>
      <br>
      [0113] Chimeric FCN-MBL proteins were expressed in stably
      transfected HEK293F cells cultured in an artificial capillary cell
      culture system (CELLMAX, Spectrum Laboratories, CA). Plasmids were
      provided by ENZON Pharmaceuticals, NJ. Proteins were batch
      purified with mannose-agarose beads, eluted with EDTA-containing
      buffer, and then dialyzed with the same buffer as for rhMBL.<br>
      <br>
      [0114] The designs of the three chimeric FCN-MBL fusion proteins
      are as follows:<br>
      <br>
      [0115] L-FCN-MBL126: L-FCN (signal sequence+collagen+"hinge" to
      ficolin domain amino acid [aa]128)+MBL (from aa126 carbohydrate
      binding domain [CRD]) (SEQ ID NO: 5).<br>
      <br>
      [0116] L-FCN-MBL76: L-FCN (signal sequence+part of collagen to
      aa82)+MBL (from aa76 including rest of
      collagen+coil-coil+carbohydrate binding domain) (SEQ ID NO: 6).<br>
      <br>
      [0117] L-FCN-MBL64: L-FCN (signal sequence+part of collagen to
      aa69)+MBL (from aa64 rest of collagen [containing
      "kink"]+coil-coil+carbohydrate binding domain) (SEQ ID NO: 7).<br>
      <br>
      [0118] Endotoxin assay: endotoxin was &lt;5 EU/mL (FDA standard)
      in all protein preparations as determined by the kinetic Limulus
      amebocyte lysate test.<br>
      <br>
      [0119] Ebola viruses: For in vitro experiments, HIV particles
      (env-negative pNL 4-3) that lacked gp120/gp41 and that expressed
      luciferase were pseudo-typed with Ebola glycoprotein. Viral
      concentrations were determined by ELISA for p24 core protein.
      Native EBOV subspecies Zaire was used for mouse experiments.<br>
      <br>
      [0120] Structure and function of rhMBL and chimeric proteins: the
      relative oligomerization was demonstrated with SDS-PAGE; protein
      composition was determined by amino acid analysis. Relative
      capacity to activate complement was determined by C4 deposition in
      an ELISA format with mannan as the capture antigen; and relative
      avidity was studied with a range of acetylated and non-acetylated
      carbohydrates in a competitive ELISA format.<br>
      <br>
      [0121] HEK293F infection-inhibition assay: 400 pg p24 HIV-Ebola GP
      particles were preincubated with MBL-deficient serum (1:2
      dilution) that was supplemented with varying amounts of rhMBL to
      test the relative capacity of rhMBL to inhibit infection. HEK293F
      cells (5*10&lt;3&gt;/well in a 96-well format) were then infected
      with the viral particles by means of spinoculation*2 hrs and then
      incubated with virus-free fresh media*40 hrs. Cell infection was
      determined by expression of luciferase.<br>
      <br>
      [0122] Murine model of EBOV infection: relevant PK parameters
      (t1/2, Cmax) of rhMBL were calculated in 8-week old C57B/6J mice
      (n=5 per group) after I.P. injection of 75 mcg (3 mg/kg) or 350
      mcg (14 mg/kg). C57B/6J mice were challenged with 100pfu EBOV
      Zaire (3000*LD50) I.P. immediately after or 12 hours before
      treatment with rhMBL 350 mcg I.P. that was continued every 12
      hours*10 days.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Results</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0123] Three chimeric proteins (FCN-MBL) were designed (FIG. 3).
      The chimeric FCN-MBL proteins comprise varying lengths of the
      carboxyl terminal of MBL (FIGS. 1 and 2) and the collagen stalk of
      L-ficolin, another lectin-like protein that activates the lectin
      complement pathway (FIG. 2). The carboxyl terminal of MBL has been
      shown to be the region responsible for binding carbohydrates, the
      carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) (FIG. 2). Human MBL

      [0133] In the above-identified sequences, the protein part
      indicated in bold indicates L-ficolin signal sequence; italics
      indicates L-ficolin component of fusion protein; and the remaining
      part is MBL component of fusion protein. The double-underlined K
      indicates a Lysine=MBL-associated serine protease (MASP) binding
      site.<br>
      <br>
      [0134] The fusion protein numbers used herein refer to the
      corresponding amino acid from the MBL protein sequence (1-248).
      Accordingly, in the L-FCN-MBL126, the number 126 corresponds to
      the first amino acid (L) of the MBL component of this fusion
      protein (aa126-248 is the Carbohydrate Recognition Domain)
      L-ficolin component=aa1-128; in the L-FCN-MBL76, the number 76
      corresponds to the first amino acid (L) of the MBL component of
      this fusion protein (aa126-248 is the Carbohydrate Recognition
      Domain) L-ficolin component=aa1-82; and in the L-FCN-MBL64, the
      number 64 corresponds to the first amino acid (Q) of the MBL
      component of this fusion protein (aa126-248 is the Carbohydrate
      Recognition Domain) L-ficolin component=aa1-64.<br>
      <br>
      [0135] The chimeric FCN-MBL fusion proteins were expressed,
      purified and analyzed on a 4-20% gradient SDS-PAGE gel, which was
      stained with Imperial Blue after electrophoresis. The recombinant
      chimeric proteins were compared to the full length rhMBL. An
      aliquot of 450 ng of each of the recombinant proteins was
      separated under reducing conditions. On the gel, the chimeric
      proteins exhibited an apparent molecular weight of ~30 kDa,
      slightly smaller than the full length rhMBL (FIG. 4). Only a
      single polypeptide was expressed for each construct.<br>
      <br>
      [0136] Under non-reducing conditions (1200 ng purified protein),
      the recombinant chimeric proteins primarily form trimers and
      tetramers whereas rhMBL forms larger multimers (FIG. 5). The
      full-length rhMBL forms larger multimers than 3 chimeric proteins
      that comprise varying lengths of the carboxy-terminal of MBL and
      the amino-terminal of L-ficolin.<br>
      <br>
      [0137] Binding of the rhMBL or any of the three chimeric FCN-MBL
      fusion proteins (10 mcg/mL in a 96-well ELISA format) to mannan
      was competed with mannan and then detected with anti-hMBL mAb
      (131-01). Binding to mannan was similar for all proteins except in
      a narrow range of concentrations (FIG. 6). The chimeric proteins
      bind a similar spectrum of carbohydrate ligands as demonstrated in
      the competitive ELISA assay.<br>
      <br>
      [0138] FIG. 13 shows a Kaplan Meier survival curve with a
      post-challenge analysis which demonstrated that recombinant human
      MBL-treated wild-type mice had a significant survival advantage:
      40% survived compared to 100% mortality among wild-type and C3
      knock-out mice treated with saline or rhMBL indicating that rhMBL
      provides protection but that the protection is dependent on C3.
      MBL treated mice survived significantly longer than mice not
      treated with MBL. EBOV was administered N 100pfu (plaque forming
      units) 3000xLD50. WT (wildtype, C57B/6J mice) versus C3 knock out
      (KO). Recombinant MBL (rhMBL) was administered at 350 mcg IL 12
      hors post challenge, then q12 h*10 days vs. sham Rx. *log rank,
      p&lt;0.0004.<br>
      <br>
      [0139] The rhMBL and the three chimeric FCN-MBL fusion proteins
      exhibited similar functional capacity to activate complement as
      determined by C4 deposition. FIG. 7 shows the C4 deposition assay
      that compared the capacity of rhMBL and the chimeric proteins to
      bind C4. This test indicates the complement activating activity of
      lectins. We showed that FCN-MBL76 has significantly greater C4
      binding activity compared with rhMBL and the other chimerics.<br>
      <br>
      [0140] Calreticulin binding assay. The 96-well ELISA plate was
      coated with rhMBL or chimeric proteins (10 ug/mL), blocked with
      BSA and incubated with 5 ug/mL biotinylated human placental
      calreticulin that was measured at absorbance O.D. 405. FCN-MBL76
      bound to human placental calreticulin significantly better than
      rhMBL or the other chimeric proteins. This likely has important
      implications for the relative functions of the proteins because
      calreticulin is the putative cellular receptor on phagocytes for
      native MBL and therefore, enhanced binding of the chimeric
      molecule results in improved pathogen clearance by
      opsonophagocytosis (FIG. 8).<br>
      <br>
      [0141] Inhibition assay using Hep G2 cells infected with
      lentivirus (HIV) pseudotyped with Ebola glycoprotein. Hep G2 cells
      at approximately 80% confluence in 96-well tissue culture plates
      were infected with HIV particles without an envelope (HIV-env neg;
      solid square) or with an envelope consisting of Ebola glycoprotein
      (other symbols). The virions encoded luciferase that was expressed
      only in infected cells and detected with a commercial luciferase
      assay. Before addition of viral particles to the cells, the
      viruses were preincubated with 0, 0.1 or 1 ug/mL of rhMBL or
      chimeric proteins in veronal-buffered saline with 5 mM CaCl2 for 1
      hour at 37 C. Infection was achieved by spinoculation of cells at
      1000 g*2 hrs. The viral protein mixture was replaced with EMEM
      culture media and incubated at 37 C for 40 hrs after which, the
      cells were lyzed and luciferase expression was quantified. rhMBL
      and the chimeric proteins inhibited viral infection to similar
      significant extents (1 ug/mL vs no protein, p&lt;0.001) (FIG. 9).<br>
      <br>
      [0142] The pharmacokinetic modeling of rhMBL in immunocompetent
      C57B/6J mice revealed that doses of 75 mcg and 350 mcg doses
      produced Cmax of ~5 mcg/mL and ~15 mcg/mL, respectively and
      half-life of ~11 hours at both doses (FIG. 10). A previous study
      showed that 75 mcg is the minimum dose of rhMBL required to
      activate complement in an MBL-deficient mouse model.<br>
      <br>
      [0143] Using the higher dosage of 350 mcg/ml, the survival rate of
      mice infected with the EBOV Zaire virus was analyzed. Data is
      presented as the Kaplan Meier survival analyses. 350 mcg rhMBL was
      given immediately pre-challenge with EBOV Zaire and continued
      every 12 hrs*10 days. These group of mice had a 42% survival rate
      (log rank, p&lt;0.008). When 350 mcg rhMBL was given 12 hours
      post-challenge with EBOV Zaire and continued every 12 hrs*10 days,
      the mice also had a 42% survival rate (log rank, p&lt;0.002).
      Therefore, the MBL proteins have preventive/prophylactic function
      as well as treatment function against viral infections.<br>
      <br>
      [0144] Accordingly, our data clearly demonstrate that rhMBL and
      chimeric FCN-MBL proteins activate complement (bind C4) to a
      similar extent. Since rhMBL has a half-life in mice of -11 hours,
      supraphysiologic doses of rhMBL administered in prophylactic and
      therapeutic regimens every 12 hours significantly reduced
      mortality by &gt;40%.<br>

      provided are methods of inhibiting prophylactically or
      therapeutically a viral infection of a host.<br>
      <br>
      <b>TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0004] The invention relates to an anti-viral polypeptide, a
      glycosylation-resistant anti-viral polypeptide, and related
      conjugates, compositions, nucleic acids, vectors, host cells,
      antibodies and methods of production and use.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0005] The field of viral therapeutics has developed in response
      to the need for agents effective against retroviruses, especially
      HIV. There are many ways in which an agent can exhibit
      anti-retroviral activity (e.g., see DeClercq, Adv. Virus Res., 42:
      1-55 (1993); DeClercq, J. Acquir. Immun. Def. Synd., 4: 207-218
      (1991); and Mitsuya et al., Science, 249: 1533-1544 (1990).
      Nucleoside derivatives, such as AZT, which inhibit the viral
      reverse transcriptase, were among the first clinically active
      agents available commercially for anti-HIV therapy. Although very
      useful in some patients, the utility of AZT and related compounds
      is limited by toxicity and insufficient therapeutic indices for
      fully adequate therapy. Also, given the subsequent revelations
      about the true dynamics of HIV infection (Coffin, Science, 267:
      483-489 (1995); and Cohen, Science, 267: 179 (1995)), it has
      become increasingly apparent that agents acting as early as
      possible in the viral replicative cycle are needed to inhibit
      infection of newly produced, uninfected immune cells generated in
      the body in response to the virus-induced killing of infected
      cells. Also, it is essential to neutralize or inhibit new
      infectious virus produced by infected cells.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Effective means for preventing HIV infection also are
      needed as a global priority. Heterosexual transmission accounts
      for the majority of new cases of HIV infection each year. Current
      reports from the World Health Organization estimate that a total
      of more than 40 million people are now infected with HIV. HIV
      prevention research has to date focused predominantly on vaccine
      development. However, no effective preventative or therapeutic
      vaccine has been identified thus far. New approaches to vaccine
      development, as well as entirely different strategies and agents
      for preventing person-to-person transmission of HIV infection, are
      needed. One approach showing great promise is the development and
      use of topical microbicides. In this approach, a suitable
      antiviral agent is applied directly at the potential site of virus
      exposure, e.g., the genital mucosa in the case of HIV. A suitable
      antiviral agent is one which inactivates or inhibits infectivity
      of a virus upon contact of the antiviral agent with the virus.
      Suitable animal models are available for demonstrating in vivo
      efficacy of such approaches for preventing transmission of
      immunodeficiency viruses, such as HIV. For instance, the
      HIV-inactivating protein, cyanovirin-N, has been shown to inhibit
      the sexual transmission of a chimeric simian/human
      immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) infection in a primate model
      employing macaques exposed to the virus vaginally or rectally (C-C
      Tsai et al., AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses, 19, 535-541 (2003) and
      C-C Tsai et al., AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses, 20, 11-18 (2004)).<br>
      <br>
      [0007] Infection of people by influenza viruses is also a major
      cause of pandemic illness, morbidity and mortality worldwide. The
      adverse economic consequences, as well as human suffering, are
      enormous. Available treatments for established infection by this
      virus are either minimally effective or ineffective; these
      treatments employ amantatadine, rimantadine and neuraminidase
      inhibitors. Of these drugs, only the neuraminidase inhibitors are
      substantially active against multiple strains of influenza virus
      that commonly infect humans, yet these drugs still have limited
      utility or efficacy against pandemic disease.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] Currently, the only effective preventative treatment
      against influenza viral infection is vaccination. However, this,
      like the drug treatments, is severely limited by the propensity of
      influenza viruses to mutate rapidly by genetic exchange, resulting
      in the emergence of highly resistant viral strains that rapidly
      infect and spread throughout susceptible populations. In fact, a
      vaccination strategy is only effective from year-to-year if the
      potential pandemic strains can be identified or predicted, and
      corresponding vaccines prepared and administered early enough that
      the year's potential pandemic can be aborted or attenuated. Thus,
      new preventative and therapeutic interventions and agents are
      urgently needed to combat influenza viruses.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] New agents with broad anti-influenza virus activity against
      diverse strains, clinical isolates and subtypes of influenza virus
      would be highly useful, since such agents would most likely remain
      active against the mutating virus. The two major types of
      influenza virus that infect humans are influenza A and B, both of
      which cause severe acute illness that may include both respiratory
      and gastrointestinal distress, as well as other serious
      pathological sequellae. An agent that has anti-influenza virus
      activity against diverse strains and isolates of both influenza A
      and B, including recent clinical isolates thereof, would be
      particularly advantageous for use in prevention or treatment of
      hosts susceptible to influenza virus infection.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] The predominant mode of transmission of influenza viral
      infection is respiratory, i.e., transmission via inhalation of
      virus-laden aerosolized particles generated through coughing,
      sneezing, breathing, etc., of an influenza-infected individual.
      Transmission of infectious influenza virions may also occur
      through contact (e.g., through inadvertent hand-to-mouth contact,
      kissing, touching, etc.) with saliva or other bodily secretions of
      an infected individual. Thus, the primary first points of contact
      of infectious influenza virions within a susceptible individual
      are the mucosal surfaces within the oropharyngeal mucosa, and the
      mucosal surfaces within the upper and lower respiratory tracts.
      Not only do these sites comprise first points of virus contact for
      initial infection of an individual, they are also the primary
      sites for production and exit (e.g., by coughing, sneezing,
      salivary transmission, etc.) of bodily fluids containing
      infectious influenza viral particles. Therefore, availability of a
      highly potent anti-influenza virus agent, having broad-spectrum
      activity against diverse strains and isolates of influenza viruses
      A and B, which could be applied or delivered topically to the
      aforementioned mucosal sites of contact and infection and
      transmission of infectious influenza viruses, would be highly
      advantageous for therapeutic and preventative inhibition of
      influenza viral infection, either in susceptible uninfected or
      infected hosts.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] In this regard, new classes of anti-viral agents, to be
      used alone or in combination existing anti-viral agents, are
      needed for effective anti-viral therapy. New agents are also
      important for the prophylactic inhibition of viral infection. In
      both areas of need, the ideal new agent(s) would act as early as
      possible in the viral life cycle; be as virus-specific as possible
      (i.e., attack a molecular target specific to the virus but not the
      host); render the intact virus noninfectious; prevent the death or
      dysfunction of virus-infected cells; prevent further production of
      virus from infected cells; prevent spread of virus infection to
      uninfected cells; be highly potent and active against the broadest
      possible range of strains and isolates of a given virus; be
      resistant to degradation under physiological and rigorous
      environmental conditions; and be readily and inexpensively
      produced.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] Accordingly, the invention provides a novel anti-viral
      polypeptide and related conjugates, nucleic acids, vectors, host
      cells and methods of production and use. This and other advantages
      of the invention, as well as additional inventive features, will
      become apparent from the description provided herein.<br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESENT INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0029] The principal overall objective of the invention is to
      provide an anti-viral polypeptide and derivatives thereof, and
      broad uses thereof (e.g., medical and research uses), including
      prophylactic and/or therapeutic applications against viruses. An
      initial observation, which led to the invention, was anti-viral
      activity of certain extracts from a marine organism, namely
      Rhodophyte (Griffithsia sp.), originally collected in the
      territorial waters of New Zealand. Low picomolar concentrations of
      a protein isolated from the extracts, referred to herein as
      griffithsin, irreversibly inactivated human clinical isolates of
      HIV. Its HIV molecular target is high mannose-comprised
      oligosaccharide constituents of Env glycoproteins. Upon binding,
      griffithsin inhibits viral binding, fusion, and entry. Griffithsin
      also targets other viruses having oligosaccharide constituents
      similar to HIV, such as other retroviruses, e.g., FIV, SIV and
      HTLV, and non-retroviruses, e.g., influenza, ebola, and measles.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] Accordingly, the invention provides an isolated and
      purified anti-viral polypeptide of SEQ ID NO: 3 from Griffithsia
      sp. and functional homologs thereof, referred to collectively as
      "griffithsin." Herein the term "griffithsin" is used generically
      to refer to a natural griffithsin or any related, functionally
      equivalent (i.e., anti-viral) polypeptide or derivative thereof.
      By definition, in this context, a related, functionally equivalent
      polypeptide or derivative thereof (a) contains a sequence of at
      least eight contiguous amino acids directly identical to a
      sub-sequence of eight contiguous amino acids contained within a
      natural griffithsin, and (b) can specifically bind to a virus, in
      particular an influenza virus or a retrovirus, more specifically a
      primate immunodeficiency virus, more specifically HIV-1, HIV-2 or
      SIV, or to an infected host cell expressing one or more viral
      antigen(s), more specifically an envelope glycoprotein, such as
      gp120, of the respective virus. In addition, such a functionally
      equivalent polypeptide or derivative thereof can comprise the
      amino acid sequence of a natural griffithsin (see SEQ ID NO: 3),
      in which 1-20, preferably 1-10, more preferably 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5,
      and most preferably 1 or 2, amino acids have been removed from one
      or both ends, preferably from only one end, e.g., removed from the
      amino-terminal end, of natural griffithsin. Alternatively, a
      functionally equivalent polypeptide or derivative thereof can
      comprise the amino acid sequence of a native griffithsin (see SEQ
      ID NO: 3), in which 1-20, preferably 1-10, more preferably 1, 2,
      3, 4, or 5, and most preferably 1 or 2, amino acids have been
      added to one or both ends, preferably from only one end, e.g., the
      amino-terminal end, of the native griffithsin.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] The invention further provides an isolated and purified
      polypeptide encoded by a nucleic acid molecule comprising a
      sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 or a nucleic acid molecule encoding an
      amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2 or SEQ ID NO: 3. Upon
      examination of the antiviral griffithsin polypeptide, the amino
      acid at position 31 of SEQ ID NO: 3 (represented as Xaa) was found
      not to be a familiar amino acid residue. Placement of an alanine
      at position 31, such as achieved in the recombinant griffithsin
      polypeptide described herein (SEQ ID NO: 2), results in a
      polypeptide exhibiting equivalent activity as the natural
      griffithsin polypeptide. If desired, the amino acid at position 31
      can be substituted with any other amino acid to facilitate protein
      production. Ideally, the substitution at position 31 of SEQ ID NO:
      3 does not diminish the anti-viral activity of the protein (e.g.,
      does not diminish the anti-viral activity more than 50%, more than
      30% or more than 10%) as compared to the anti-viral activity of
      the native protein. Preferably, the aforementioned nucleic acid
      molecules encode at least eight (e.g., at least 10, at least 20,
      at least 30, at least 50, at least 70, at least 80, at least 90,
      or at least 100) contiguous amino acids of the amino acid sequence
      of SEQ ID NO: 3, which desirably have anti-viral activity. If the
      at least eight contiguous amino acids of SEQ ID NO: 3 comprise
      amino acids 1-121, desirably amino acid residue 45, 60, 71, and/or
      104 has been rendered glycosylation resistant, while maintaining
      antiviral activity of the polypeptide.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] The term "isolated" as used herein means having been
      removed from its natural environment. The term "purified" as used
      herein means having been increased in purity, wherein "purity" is
      a relative term and not to be construed as absolute purity. By
      "antiviral" is meant that the polypeptide or fragment thereof can
      inhibit a virus (e.g., inhibit entry of a virus into a host cell,
      limit the spread of viral infection by inhibiting cell to cell
      fusion, and the like), in particular an influenza virus, such as
      influenza virus or a strain A or strain B, or a retrovirus,
      specifically a primate immunodeficiency virus, more specifically a
      human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), such as HIV-1, HIV-2 or SIV.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] Preferably, the polypeptide or derivative thereof comprises
      an amino acid sequence that is substantially homologous to that of
      an anti-viral protein from Griffithsia sp. By "substantially
      homologous" is meant sufficient homology to render the polypeptide
      or derivative thereof anti-viral, with anti-viral activity
      characteristic of an anti-viral protein isolated from Griffithsia
      sp. At least about 50% homology (e.g., at least about 60%
      homology, at least about 65% homology, or at least about 70%
      homology), preferably at least about 75% homology (e.g., at least
      about 80% homology or at least about 85% homology), and most
      preferably at least about 90% homology (e.g., at least about 95%
      homology) should exist.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] Alterations of the natural amino acid sequence to produce
      variant polypeptides can be done by a variety of means known to
      those skilled in the art. For instance, amino acid substitutions
      can be conveniently introduced into the polypeptides at the time
      of synthesis. Alternatively, site-specific mutations can be
      introduced by ligating into an expression vector a synthesized
      oligonucleotide comprising the modified site. Alternately,
      oligonucleotide-directed, site-specific mutagenesis procedures can
      be used, such as disclosed in Walder et al., Gene, 42: 133 (1986);
      Bauer et al., Gene, 37: 73 (1985); Craik, Biotechniques, 12-19
      (January 1995); and U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,518,584 and 4,737,462.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] It is within the skill of the ordinary artisan to select
      synthetic and naturally-occurring amino acids that effect
      conservative or neutral substitutions for any particular
      naturally-occurring amino acids. The ordinarily skilled artisan
      desirably will consider the context in which any particular amino
      acid substitution is made, in addition to considering the
      hydrophobicity or polarity of the side-chain, the general size of
      the side chain and the pK value of side-chains with acidic or
      basic character under physiological conditions. For example,
      lysine, arginine, and histidine are often suitably substituted for
      each other, and more often arginine and histidine. As is known in
      the art, this is because all three amino acids have basic side
      chains, whereas the pK value for the side-chains of lysine and
      arginine are much closer to each other (about 10 and 12) than to
      histidine (about 6). Similarly, glycine, alanine, valine, leucine,
      and isoleucine are often suitably substituted for each other, with
      the proviso that glycine is frequently not suitably substituted
      for the other members of the group. This is because each of these
      amino acids are relatively hydrophobic when incorporated into a
      polypeptide, but glycine's lack of an [alpha]-carbon allows the
      phi and psi angles of rotation (around the [alpha]-carbon) so much
      conformational freedom that glycinyl residues can trigger changes
      in conformation or secondary structure that do not often occur
      when the other amino acids are substituted for each other. Other
      groups of amino acids frequently suitably substituted for each
      other include, but are not limited to, the group consisting of
      glutamic and aspartic acids; the group consisting of
      phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan; and the group consisting
      of serine, threonine and, optionally, tyrosine. Additionally, the
      ordinarily skilled artisan can readily group synthetic amino acids
      with naturally-occurring amino acids.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] The ordinarily skilled artisan can generate griffithsin
      mutants or variants by, for example, substituting or mutating
      amino acids which are not critical for the anti-viral function of
      the polypeptide. Ideally, mutations that do not modify the
      electronic or structural environment of the peptide are generated
      to retain optimal antiviral activity. For example, natural
      griffithsin forms dimers, which can be advantageous in some
      embodiments. Therefore, alterations which do not disrupt dimer
      formation can be preferred. Amino acid residues which are not
      responsible for folding or stability of the three-dimensional
      conformation of the griffithsin polypeptide are candidate residues
      for mutation. Alternatively or in addition, amino acids which are
      not involved in glycoprotein binding can be mutated or replaced.
      It is understood that surface hydrophobicity plays a key role in
      protein-protein interactions and surface electrophilicity is
      important to protein-sugar interactions, such as the interaction
      between griffithsin and viral proteins. Hydrophobic surface
      clusters and electrophilic surface clusters on the griffithsin
      peptide or homologs which suggest regions critical for interaction
      with the viral envelope can be mapped using routine methods such
      as those disclosed in Bewley et al., Nature Structural Biology,
      5(7): 571-578 (1998). Amino acid residues not found either in
      electrophilic or hydrophobic surface clusters are likely not
      critical for hydrophobicity or electrophilicity of these clusters
      and, thus, are appropriate targets for mutation to create
      griffithsin fragments (e.g., anti-viral polypeptides comprising at
      least about eight contiguous amino acids of SEQ ID NO: 2 or SEQ ID
      NO: 3), variants, mutants, or homologs (e.g., griffithsin variants
      having 80%, 85%, or 90% homology to SEQ ID NO: 2 or SEQ ID NO: 3)
      which retain antiviral activity. If desired, amino acid residues
      which are responsible for binding to high-mannose
      oligosaccharide-containing glycoproteins on the viral surface can
      be mutated to increase the specificity or affinity of glycoprotein
      binding.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] If desired, the proteins and peptides of the invention
      (including antiviral fragments, variant polypeptides, fusion
      proteins, and conjugates) can be modified, for instance, by
      glycosylation, amidation, carboxylation, or phosphorylation, or by
      the creation of acid addition salts, amides, esters, in particular
      C-terminal esters, and N-acyl derivatives of the proteins of the
      invention. The polypeptides also can be modified to create protein
      derivatives by forming covalent or noncovalent complexes with
      other moieties in accordance with methods known in the art.
      Covalently-bound complexes can be prepared by linking the chemical
      moieties to functional groups on the side chains of amino acids
      comprising the proteins, or at the N- or C-terminus. Desirably,
      such modifications and conjugations do not adversely affect the
      activity of the polypeptides (and variants thereof). While such
      modifications and conjugations can have greater or lesser
      activity, the activity desirably is not negated and is
      characteristic of the unaltered polypeptide.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] The polypeptides (and fragments, homologs, variants, and
      fusion proteins) can be prepared by any of a number of
      conventional techniques. The polypeptide can be isolated or
      purified from a naturally occurring source or from a recombinant
      source. For instance, in the case of recombinant proteins, a DNA
      fragment encoding a desired polypeptide can be subcloned into an
      appropriate vector using well-known molecular genetic techniques
      (see, e.g., Maniatis et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory
      Manual, 2nd ed. (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (1989)) and other
      references cited herein under "EXAMPLES"). The fragment can be
      transcribed and the polypeptide subsequently translated in vitro.
      Commercially available kits also can be employed (e.g., such as
      manufactured by Clontech, Palo Alto, Calif.; Amersham Life
      Sciences, Inc., Arlington Heights, Ill.; InVitrogen, San Diego,
      Calif.; and the like). The polymerase chain reaction optionally
      can be employed in the manipulation of nucleic acids.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] Such polypeptides also can be synthesized using an
      automated peptide synthesizer in accordance with methods known in
      the art. Alternately, the polypeptide (and fragments, homologs,
      variants, and fusion proteins) can be synthesized using standard
      peptide synthesizing techniques well-known to those of skill in
      the art (e.g., as summarized in Bodanszky, Principles of Peptide
      Synthesis, (Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg: 1984)). In particular,
      the polypeptide can be synthesized using the procedure of
      solid-phase synthesis (see, e.g., Merrifield, J. Am. Chem. Soc.,
      85: 2149-54 (1963); Barany et al., Int. J. Peptide Protein Res.,
      30: 705-739 (1987); and U.S. Pat. No. 5,424,398). If desired, this
      can be done using an automated peptide synthesizer. Removal of the
      t-butyloxycarbonyl (t-BOC) or 9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl (Fmoc)
      amino acid blocking groups and separation of the polypeptide from
      the resin can be accomplished by, for example, acid treatment at
      reduced temperature. The protein-containing mixture then can be
      extracted, for instance, with diethyl ether, to remove
      non-peptidic organic compounds, and the synthesized polypeptide
      can be extracted from the resin powder (e.g., with about 25% w/v
      acetic acid). Following the synthesis of the polypeptide, further
      purification (e.g., using HPLC) optionally can be preformed in
      order to eliminate any incomplete proteins, polypeptides, peptides
      or free amino acids. Amino acid and/or HPLC analysis can be
      performed on the synthesized polypeptide to validate its identity.
      For other applications according to the invention, it may be
      preferable to produce the polypeptide as part of a larger fusion
      protein, either by chemical conjugation or through genetic means,
      such as are known to those skilled in the art. In this regard, the
      invention also provides a fusion protein comprising the isolated
      or purified antiviral polypeptide (or fragment thereof) or variant
      thereof and one or more other protein(s) having any desired
      properties or effector functions, such as cytotoxic or
      immunological properties, or other desired properties, such as to
      facilitate isolation, purification, analysis, or stability of the
      fusion protein.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] A griffithsin conjugate comprising a griffithsin coupled to
      at least one effector component, which can be the same or
      different, is also provided. The effector component can be
      polyethylene glycol, dextran, albumin, an immunological reagent, a
      toxin, an antiviral agent, or a solid support matrix.
      "Immunological reagent" will be used to refer to an antibody, an
      antibody fragment (e.g., an F(ab')2, an Fab', an Fab, an Fv, an
      sFv, a dsFv, or an Fc antibody fragment), an immunoglobulin, and
      an immunological recognition element. An immunological recognition
      element is an element, such as a peptide, e.g., the FLAG sequence
      of a recombinant griffithsin-FLAG fusion protein, which
      facilitates, through immunological recognition, isolation and/or
      purification and/or analysis of the protein or peptide to which it
      is attached. An immunological reagent also can be an immunogenic
      peptide, which can be fused to griffithsin for enhancing an immune
      response. In this respect, the invention provides an anti-viral
      conjugate comprising a griffithsin polypeptide or fragment thereof
      bound to a virus or viral envelope glycoprotein. A griffithsin
      fusion protein is a type of griffithsin conjugate, wherein a
      griffithsin is coupled to one or more other protein(s) having any
      desired properties or effector functions, such as cytotoxic or
      immunological properties, or other desired properties, such as to
      facilitate isolation, purification or analysis of the fusion
      protein or increase the stability or in vivo half-life of the
      fusion protein. Griffithsin also can be attached to a chemical
      moiety which allows recognition, isolation, purification, and/or
      analysis of the protein or peptide. An example of such a chemical
      moiety is a His tag of a recombinant griffithsin-His fusion
      protein.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] A "toxin" can be, for example, Pseudomonas exotoxin. An
      "antiviral agent" can be AZT, ddI, ddC, 3TC gancyclovir,
      fluorinated dideoxynucleosides, nevirapine, R82913, Ro 31-8959,
      BI-RJ-70, acyclovir, [alpha]-interferon, recombinant sCD4,
      michellamines, calanolides, nonoxynol-9, gossypol and derivatives
      thereof, gramicidin, amantatadine, rimantadine, and neuraminidase
      inhibitors, and cyanovirin-N or a functional homolog or derivative
      thereof (see, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,843,882). A "solid
      support matrix" can be a magnetic bead, a flow-through matrix, a
      sponge, a stent, a culture plate, or a matrix comprising a
      contraceptive device, such as a condom, diaphragm, cervical cap,
      vaginal ring or contraceptive sponge. In an alternative
      embodiment, a solid support matrix can be an implant for surgical
      implantation in a host and, if appropriate, later removal.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] In view of the foregoing, the invention further provides a
      composition comprising (i) the isolated or purified antiviral
      polypeptide (or fragment thereof), a variant thereof, a fusion
      protein of the antiviral polypeptide (or fragment thereof) or
      variant thereof, and a conjugate of the antiviral polypeptide (or
      fragment thereof) or variant thereof, and/or (ii) a carrier,
      excipient or adjuvant therefor. Preferably, component (i) of the
      composition is present in an antiviral effective amount and the
      carrier is pharmaceutically acceptable. By "antiviral effective
      amount" is meant an amount sufficient to inhibit the infectivity
      of the virus.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] The carrier can be any of those conventionally used and is
      limited only by chemico-physical considerations, such as
      solubility and lack of reactivity with the active agent of the
      invention, and by the route of administration. It is preferred
      that the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier be one which is
      chemically inert to the active agent and one which has no
      detrimental side effects or toxicity under the conditions of use.
      The pharmaceutically acceptable carriers described herein, for
      example, vehicles, adjuvants, excipients, and diluents, are
      well-known to those ordinarily skilled in the art and are readily
      available to the public. Typically, the composition, such as a
      pharmaceutical composition, can comprise a physiological saline
      solution; dextrose or other saccharide solution; or ethylene,
      propylene, polyethylene, or other glycol. The pharmaceutical
      composition preferably does not comprise mannose or
      N-acetyl-glucosamine, as these molecules may interfere with the
      functioning of the antiviral agent.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] The invention also provides a method of obtaining a
      griffithsin from Griffithsia sp. Such a method comprises (a)
      identifying an extract of Griffithsia sp. containing anti-viral
      activity, (b) optionally removing high molecular weight
      biopolymers from the extract, (c) anti-viral bioassay-guided
      fractionating the extract to obtain a crude extract of
      griffithsin, and (d) purifying the crude extract by reverse-phase
      HPLC to obtain griffithsin (see, also, Example 1). More
      specifically, the method involves the use of ethanol to remove
      high molecular weight biopolymers from the extract and the use of
      an anti-HIV bioassay to guide fractionation of the extract.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] Griffithsin (a polypeptide of exactly SEQ ID NO: 3), which
      was isolated and purified using the aforementioned method, was
      subjected to conventional procedures typically used to determine
      the amino acid sequence of a given pure protein. Thus, the
      griffithsin was initially sequenced by N-terminal Edman
      degradation of intact protein and numerous overlapping peptide
      fragments generated by endoproteinase digestion. Amino acid
      analysis was in agreement with the deduced sequence. ESI mass
      spectrometry of reduced, HPLC-purified griffithsin showed a
      molecular ion consistent with the calculated value. These studies
      indicated that griffithsin from Griffithsia was comprised of a
      unique sequence of 121 amino acids having little or no significant
      homology or identity to previously described proteins or
      transcription products of known nucleotide sequences. No more than
      eight contiguous amino acids from griffithsin were found in any
      amino acid sequences from known proteins, nor were there any known
      proteins from any source having significant sequence identity with
      griffithsin. Given the chemically deduced amino acid sequence of
      griffithsin, a corresponding recombinant griffithsin
      (r-griffithsin) was created and used to establish definitively
      that the deduced amino acid sequence was, indeed, active against
      virus, such as HIV and influenza.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] Accordingly, the invention provides isolated and purified
      nucleic acid molecules and synthetic nucleic acid molecules, which
      comprise a coding sequence for a griffithsin, such as an isolated
      and purified nucleic acid molecule comprising a sequence of SEQ ID
      NO: 1, an isolated and purified nucleic acid molecule encoding an
      amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2, an isolated and purified
      nucleic acid sequence encoding an amino acid sequence SEQ ID NO:
      3, an isolated and purified nucleic acid molecule comprising a
      sequence of SEQ ID NO: 4, an isolated and purified nucleic acid
      sequence encoding an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 5, and a
      nucleic acid molecule that is substantially homologous or
      substantially identical to any one of the aforementioned nucleic
      acid molecules. By "substantially homologous" is meant sufficient
      homology to render the polypeptide or derivative thereof
      anti-viral, with anti-viral activity characteristic of an
      anti-viral protein isolated from Griffithsia. At least about 50%
      homology or identity (e.g., at least about 60%, at least about
      65%, or at least about 70% homology or identity), preferably at
      least about 75% homology or identity (e.g., at least about 80% or
      at least about 85% homology or identity), and most preferably at
      least about 90% homology or identity (e.g., at least about 95%
      homology or identity) should exist.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] The inventive nucleic acid molecule preferably comprises a
      nucleic acid sequence encoding at least eight (preferably at least
      10, more preferably at least 20, and most preferably at least 30)
      contiguous amino acids of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 3
      or SEQ ID NO: 2. The inventive nucleic acid molecule also
      comprises a nucleic acid sequence encoding a polypeptide
      comprising the amino acid sequence of a native griffithsin, in
      which 1-20, preferably 1-10, more preferably 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, and
      most preferably 1 or 2, amino acids have been removed from one or
      both ends, preferably from only one end, e.g., removed from the
      amino-terminal end, of the native griffithsin. Alternatively, the
      nucleic acid molecule can comprise a nucleic acid sequence
      encoding a polypeptide comprising the amino acid sequence of a
      natural griffithsin (see SEQ ID NO: 3), in which 1-20, preferably
      1-10, more preferably 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, and most preferably 1 or
      2, amino acids have been added to one or both ends, preferably
      from only one end, e.g., the amino-terminal end, of the native
      griffithsin. Preferably, the isolated and purified nucleic acid
      molecule encodes a polypeptide comprising at least eight
      contiguous amino acids of SEQ ID NO: 3, which desirably have
      anti-viral activity. If the at least eight contiguous amino acids
      comprise amino acids 1-121 of SEQ ID NO: 3, desirably amino acids
      46, 60, 71, and/or 104 have been rendered glycosylation resistant,
      while maintaining antiviral activity of the polypeptide. Deletions
      and substitutions of SEQ ID NO: 2 or SEQ ID NO: 3 are within the
      skill in the art.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] Given the present disclosure, it will be apparent to one
      skilled in the art that a partial griffithsin gene sequence will
      likely suffice to code for a fully functional, i.e., anti-viral,
      such as anti-influenza or anti-HIV, griffithsin. A minimum
      essential DNA coding sequence(s) for a functional griffithsin can
      readily be determined by one skilled in the art, for example, by
      synthesis and evaluation of sub-sequences comprising the native
      griffithsin, and by site-directed mutagenesis studies of the
      griffithsin DNA coding sequence.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] Using an appropriate DNA coding sequence, a recombinant
      griffithsin can be made by genetic engineering techniques (for
      general background see, e.g., Nicholl, in An Introduction to
      Genetic Engineering, Cambridge University Press: Cambridge (1994),
      pp. 1-5 &amp; 127-130; Steinberg et al., in Recombinant DNA
      Technology Concepts and Biomedical Applications, Prentice Hall:
      Englewood Cliffs, N.J. (1993), pp. 81-124 &amp; 150-162; Sofer in
      Introduction to Genetic Engineering, Butterworth-Heinemann,
      Stoneham, Mass. (1991), pp. 1-21 &amp; 103-126; Old et al., in
      Principles of Gene Manipulation, Blackwell Scientific Publishers:
      London (1992), pp. 1-13 &amp; 108-221; and Emtage, in Delivery
      Systems for Peptide Drugs, Davis et al., eds., Plenum Press: New
      York (1986), pp. 23-33). For example, a Griffithsia gene or cDNA
      encoding a griffithsin can be identified and subcloned. The gene
      or cDNA then can be incorporated into an appropriate expression
      vector and delivered into an appropriate polypeptide-synthesizing
      organism (e.g., E. coli, S. cerevisiae, P. pastoris, or other
      bacterial, yeast, insect, plant or mammalian cells), where the
      gene, under the control of an endogenous or exogenous promoter,
      can be appropriately transcribed and translated. Alternatively,
      the expression vector can be administered to a plant or animal,
      for example, for large-scale production (see, e.g., Fischer et
      al., Transgenic Res., 9 (4-5): 279-299 (2000); Fischer et al., J.
      Biol. Regul. Homeost. Agents, 14: 83-92 (2000); deWilde et al.,

      al., PNAS USA, 96: 703-708 (1999); Zeitlin et al., Nature
      Biotech., 16: 1361-1364 (1998); Tacker et al., Microbes and
      Infection, 1: 777-783 (1999); Tacket et al., Nature Med., 4(5):

      from Plants, Production and Isolation of Clinically Useful
      Compounds, Cunningham and Porter, eds., Humana Press: Totowa, N.J.
      (1998)). Such expression vectors (including, but not limited to,
      phage, cosmid, viral, and plasmid vectors) are known to those
      skilled in the art, as are reagents and techniques appropriate for
      gene transfer (e.g., transfection, electroporation, transduction,
      micro-injection, transformation, etc.). If a griffithsin is to be
      recombinantly produced in isolated eukaryotic cells or in a
      eukaryotic organism, such as a plant (see above references and
      also Methods in Biotechnology, Recombinant Proteins from Plants,
      Production and Isolation of Clinically Useful Compounds,
      Cunningham and Porter, eds., Humana Press: Totowa, N.J. (1998)),
      desirably the N-linked glycosylation sites at positions 45, 60,
      71, and/or 104 is rendered glycosylation-resistant, such as in
      accordance with the methods described herein. Subsequently, the
      recombinantly produced polypeptide can be isolated and purified
      using standard techniques known in the art (e.g., chromatography,
      centrifugation, differential solubility, isoelectric focusing,
      etc.), and assayed for anti-viral activity.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] Alternatively, a natural griffithsin can be obtained from
      Griffithsia by non-recombinant methods, and sequenced by
      conventional techniques. The sequence can then be used to
      synthesize the corresponding DNA, which can be subcloned into an
      appropriate expression vector and delivered into a
      polypeptide-producing cell for en mass recombinant production of
      the desired polypeptide.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] In this regard, the invention also provides a vector
      comprising a DNA sequence, e.g., a Griffithsia gene sequence for
      griffithsin, a cDNA encoding a griffithsin, or a synthetic DNA
      sequence encoding griffithsin. The vector can be targeted to a
      cell-surface receptor if so desired. A nucleic acid molecule as
      described above can be cloned into any suitable vector and can be
      used to transform or transfect any suitable host. The selection of
      vectors and methods to construct them are commonly known to
      persons of ordinary skill in the art and are described in general
      technical references (see, in general, "Recombinant DNA Part D,"
      Methods in Enzymology, Vol. 153, Wu and Grossman, eds., Academic
      Press (1987) and the references cited herein under "EXAMPLES").
      Desirably, the vector comprises regulatory sequences, such as
      transcription and translation initiation and termination codons,
      which are specific to the type of host (e.g., bacterium, fungus,
      plant or animal) into which the vector is to be introduced, as
      appropriate and taking into consideration whether the vector is
      DNA or RNA. Preferably, the vector comprises regulatory sequences
      that are specific to the genus of the host. Most preferably, the
      vector comprises regulatory sequences that are specific to the
      species of the host.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] Constructs of vectors, which are circular or linear, can be
      prepared to contain an entire nucleic acid as described above or a
      portion thereof ligated to a replication system functional in a
      prokaryotic or eukaryotic host cell. Replication systems can be
      derived from Co1E1, 2 m[mu] plasmid, [lambda], SV40, bovine
      papilloma virus, and the like.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] In addition to the replication system and the inserted
      nucleic acid, the construct can include one or more marker genes,
      which allow for selection of transformed or transfected hosts.
      Marker genes include biocide resistance, e.g., resistance to
      antibiotics, heavy metals, etc., complementation in an auxotrophic
      host to provide prototrophy, and the like.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that any
      of a number of vectors known in the art are suitable for use in
      the invention. Suitable vectors include those designed for
      propagation and expansion or for expression or both. Examples of
      suitable vectors include, for instance, plasmids, plasmid-liposome
      complexes, and viral vectors, e.g., parvoviral-based vectors
      (i.e., adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based vectors), retroviral
      vectors, herpes simplex virus (HSV)-based vectors, and
      adenovirus-based vectors. Any of these expression constructs can
      be prepared using standard recombinant DNA techniques described
      in, e.g., Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual,
      2&lt;nd &gt;edition, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold
      Spring Harbor, N.Y. (1989); Ausubel et al., Current Protocols in
      Molecular Biology, Greene Publishing Associates and John Wiley
      &amp; Sons, New York, N.Y. (1994); Fischer et al., Transgenic
      Res., 9 (4-5): 279-299 (2000); Fischer et al., J. Biol. Regul.

      and Tacket et al., Nature Med., 4(5): 607-609 (1998). Examples of
      cloning vectors include the pUC series, the pBluescript series
      (Stratagene, LaJolla, Calif.), the pET series (Novagen, Madison,
      Wis.), the pGEX series (Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden), and
      the pEX series (Clonetech, Palo Alto, Calif.). Bacteriophage
      vectors, such as [lambda]GT10, [lambda]GT11, [lambda]ZapII
      (Stratagene), [lambda] EMBL4, and [lambda] NM1149, also can be
      used. Examples of plant expression vectors include pBI101,
      pBI101.2, pBI101.3, pBI121 and pBIN19 (Clonetech, Palo Alto,
      Calif.). Examples of animal expression vectors include pEUK-C1,
      pMAM and pMAMneo (Clonetech).<br>
      <br>
      [0055] An expression vector can comprise a native or normative
      promoter operably linked to an isolated or purified nucleic acid
      as described above. The selection of promoters, e.g., strong,
      weak, inducible, tissue-specific and developmental-specific, is
      within the skill in the art. Similarly, the combining of a nucleic
      acid molecule as described above with a promoter is also within

      [0056] The DNA, whether isolated and purified or synthetic, or
      cDNA encoding a griffithsin can encode for either the entire
      griffithsin or a portion thereof. Where the DNA or cDNA does not
      comprise the entire coding sequence of the native griffithsin, the
      DNA or cDNA can be subcloned as part of a gene fusion. In a
      transcriptional gene fusion, the DNA or cDNA will contain its own
      control sequence directing appropriate production of protein
      (e.g., ribosome binding site, translation initiation codon, etc.),
      and the transcriptional control sequences (e.g., promoter elements
      and/or enhancers) will be provided by the vector. In a
      translational gene fusion, transcriptional control sequences as
      well as at least some of the translational control sequences
      (i.e., the translational initiation codon) will be provided by the
      vector. In the case of a translational gene fusion, a chimeric
      protein will be produced.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] Genes also can be constructed for specific fusion proteins
      containing a functional griffithsin component plus a fusion
      component conferring additional desired attribute(s) to the
      composite protein. For example, a fusion sequence for a toxin or
      immunological reagent can be added to facilitate purification and
      analysis of the functional protein.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] Genes can be specifically constructed to code for fusion
      proteins, which contain a griffithsin coupled to an effector
      protein, such as a toxin or immunological reagent, for specific
      targeting to a virus or viral-infected cells, e.g., HIV and/or
      HIV-infected cells or influenza and/or influenza-infected cells.
      In these instances, the griffithsin moiety serves not only as a
      neutralizing agent but also as a targeting agent to direct the
      effector activities of these molecules selectively against a given
      virus, such as HIV or influenza. Thus, for example, a therapeutic
      agent can be obtained by combining the HIV-targeting function or
      influenza-targeting function of a functional griffithsin with a
      toxin aimed at neutralizing infectious virus and/or by destroying
      cells producing infectious virus, such as HIV or influenza.
      Similarly, a therapeutic agent can be obtained, which combines the
      viral-targeting function of a griffithsin with the multivalency
      and effector functions of various immunoglobulin subclasses.
      Example 6 further illustrates the viral-targeting, specifically
      gp120-targeting, properties of a griffithsin.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] Similar rationales underlie extensive developmental
      therapeutic efforts exploiting the HIV gp120-targeting properties
      of sCD4. For example, sCD4-toxin conjugates have been prepared in
      which sCD4 is coupled to a Pseudomonas exotoxin component
      (Chaudhary et al., in The Human Retrovirus, Gallo et al., eds.,
      Academic Press: San Diego, Calif. (1991), pp. 379-387; and
      Chaudhary et al., Nature, 335: 369-372 (1988)), or to a diphtheria
      toxin component (Aullo et al., EMBO J., 11: 575-583 (1992)) or to
      a ricin A-chain component (Till et al., Science, 242: 1166-1167
      (1988)). Likewise, sCD4-immunoglobulin conjugates have been
      prepared in attempts to decrease the rate of in vivo clearance of
      functional sCD4 activity, to enhance placental transfer, and to
      effect a targeted recruitment of immunological mechanisms of
      pathogen elimination, such as phagocytic engulfment and killing by
      antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, to kill and/or
      remove HIV-infected cells and virus (Capon et al., Nature, 337:
      525-531 (1989); Traunecker et al., Nature, 339: 68-70 (1989); and
      Langner et al. (1993), supra). While such CD4-immunoglobulin
      conjugates (sometimes called "immunoadhesins") have, indeed, shown
      advantageous pharmacokinetic and distributional attributes in
      vivo, and anti-HIV effects in vitro, clinical results have been
      discouraging (Schooley et al. (1990), supra; Husson et al. (1992),
      supra; and Langner et al. (1993), supra). This is not surprising
      since clinical isolates of HIV, as opposed to laboratory strains,
      are highly resistant to binding and neutralization by sCD4 (Orloff
      et al. (1995), supra; and Moore et al. (1992), supra). The
      griffithsin polypeptide binds to a wide range of sugars present on
      viral glycoproteins and, therefore, can inhibit a wide range of
      viruses which display those glycoproteins. The extraordinarily
      broad targeting properties of a functional griffithsin to viruses,
      e.g., primate retroviruses, in general, and clinical and
      laboratory strains, in particular, can be especially advantageous
      for combining with toxins, immunoglobulins and other selected
      effector proteins.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] Viral-targeted conjugates can be prepared either by genetic
      engineering techniques (see, for example, Chaudhary et al. (1988),
      supra) or by chemical coupling of the targeting component with an
      effector component. The most feasible or appropriate technique to
      be used to construct a given griffithsin conjugate or fusion
      protein will be selected based upon consideration of the
      characteristics of the particular effector molecule selected for
      coupling to a griffithsin. For example, with a selected
      non-proteinaceous effector molecule, chemical coupling, rather
      than genetic engineering techniques, may be the only feasible
      option for creating the desired griffithsin conjugate.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] Accordingly, the invention also provides nucleic acid
      molecules encoding griffithsin fusion proteins. In particular, the
      invention provides a nucleic acid molecule comprising SEQ ID NO: 4
      and substantially homologous sequences thereof. Also provided is a
      vector comprising a nucleic acid sequence encoding a griffithsin
      fusion protein and a method of obtaining a griffithsin fusion
      protein by expression of the vector encoding a griffithsin fusion
      protein in a protein-synthesizing organism as described above.
      Accordingly, griffithsin fusion proteins are also provided.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] In view of the above, the invention further provides an
      isolated and purified nucleic acid molecule, which comprises a
      griffithsin coding sequence, such as one of the aforementioned
      nucleic acids, namely a nucleic acid molecule encoding an amino
      acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2 or SEQ ID NO: 3 or a nucleic acid
      molecule comprising a sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 coupled to a second
      nucleic acid encoding an effector protein. The first nucleic acid
      preferably comprises a nucleic acid sequence encoding at least
      eight contiguous amino acids of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID
      NO: 2 or SEQ ID NO: 3, which encodes a functional griffithsin, and
      the second nucleic acid preferably encodes an effector protein,
      such as a toxin or immunological reagent as described herein.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] Accordingly, the invention also further provides an
      isolated and purified fusion protein encoded by a nucleic acid
      molecule comprising a sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 or a nucleic acid
      molecule encoding an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2 or SEQ ID
      NO: 3, either one of which is coupled to a second nucleic acid
      encoding an effector protein. Preferably, the aforementioned
      nucleic acid molecules encode at least eight contiguous amino
      acids of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2 or SEQ ID NO: 3,
      which desirably have anti-viral activity, coupled to an effector
      molecule, such as a toxin or immunological reagent as described
      above. Preferably, the effector molecule targets a virus, more
      preferably HIV or influenza, and, most preferably glycoprotein
      gp120 of HIV or hemagluttinin of influenza. If the at least eight
      contiguous amino acids of SEQ ID NO: 3 (or SEQ ID NO: 2) comprise
      amino acids 1-121, desirably amino acids 46, 60, 71, and/or 104
      have been rendered glycosylation-resistant, yet maintain antiviral
      activity by substitution of the asparagine at those positions
      with, for example, an alanine or a glutamine residue.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] The coupling can be effected at the DNA level or by
      chemical coupling as described above. For example, a
      griffithsin-effector protein conjugate of the invention can be
      obtained by (a) selecting a desired effector protein or peptide;
      (b) synthesizing a composite DNA coding sequence comprising a
      first DNA coding sequence comprising one of the aforementioned
      nucleic acid sequences, which codes for a functional griffithsin,
      coupled to a second DNA coding sequence for an effector protein or
      peptide, e.g., a toxin or immunological reagent; (c) expressing
      said composite DNA coding sequence in an appropriate
      protein-synthesizing organism; and (d) purifying the desired
      fusion protein to substantially pure form. Alternatively, a
      griffithsin-effector molecule conjugate of the invention can be
      obtained by (a) selecting a desired effector molecule and a
      griffithsin or griffithsin fusion protein; (b) chemically coupling
      the griffithsin or griffithsin fusion protein to the effector
      molecule; and (c) purifying the desired griffithsin-effector
      molecule conjugate to substantially pure form.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] Conjugates comprising a functional griffithsin (e.g., an
      anti-viral polypeptide comprising at least eight contiguous amino
      acids of SEQ ID NO: 3, such as SEQ ID NO: 3, wherein the at least
      eight contiguous amino acids bind to a virus, in particular an
      infectious virus, such as influenza virus or HIV, in which case
      the griffithsin binds to gp120 or hemagluttinin) coupled to an
      anti-griffithsin antibody, a virus, a viral glycoprotein, or at
      least one effector component, which can be the same or different,
      such as a toxin, an immunological reagent, an antiviral agent, or
      other functional reagent, can be designed even more specifically
      to exploit the unique viral targeting, e.g., gp120-targeting
      properties, of griffithsins.<br>
      <br>
      [0066] Other functional reagents that can be used as effector
      components in the inventive conjugates can include, for example,
      polyethylene glycol, dextran, albumin, a solid support matrix, and
      the like, whose intended effector functions may include one or
      more of the following: to improve stability of the conjugate; to
      increase the half-life of the conjugate; to increase resistance of
      the conjugate to proteolysis; to decrease the immunogenicity of
      the conjugate; to provide a means to attach or immobilize a
      functional griffithsin onto a solid support matrix (e.g., see, for
      example, Harris, in Poly(Ethylene Glycol) Chemistry: Biotechnical
      and Biomedical Applications, Harris, ed., Plenum Press: New York
      (1992), pp. 1-14). Conjugates furthermore can comprise a
      functional griffithsin coupled to more than one effector molecule,
      each of which, optionally, can have different effector functions
      (e.g., such as a toxin molecule (or an immunological reagent) and
      a polyethylene glycol (or dextran or albumin) molecule). Diverse
      applications and uses of functional proteins and peptides, such as
      in the present instance a functional griffithsin, attached to or
      immobilized on a solid support matrix, are exemplified more
      specifically for poly(ethylene glycol) conjugated proteins or
      peptides in a review by Holmberg et al. (In Poly(Ethylene Glycol)
      Chemistry: Biotechnical and Biomedical Applications, Harris, ed.,
      Plenum Press: New York (1992), pp. 303-324). Preferred examples of
      solid support matrices include magnetic beads, a flow-through
      matrix, and a matrix comprising a contraceptive device, such as a
      condom, a diaphragm, a cervical cap, a vaginal ring or a sponge.<br>
      <br>
      [0067] Example 4 reveals novel gp120-directed effects of
      griffithsins. Solid-phase ELISA experiments show that griffithsin
      is capable of global conformational effects on gp120, as observed
      as a decrease of immunoreactivity at multiple, distinct,
      non-overlapping epitopes.<br>
      <br>
      [0068] The range of anti-viral activity of griffithsin against
      diverse CD4&lt;+&gt;-tropic immunodeficiency virus strains in
      various target cells is remarkable; virtually all tested strains
      of HIV-1, HIV-2 and SIV were similarly sensitive to griffithsin;
      clinical isolates and laboratory strains showed essentially
      equivalent sensitivity. Cocultivation of chronically infected and
      uninfected CEM-SS cells with griffithsin did not inhibit viral
      replication, but did cause a concentration-dependent inhibition of
      cell-to-cell fusion and virus transmission; similar results from
      binding and fusion inhibition assays employing
      HeLa-CD4-LTR-[beta]-galactosidase cells were consistent with
      griffithsin inhibition of virus-cell and/or cell-cell binding.<br>
      <br>
      [0069] The anti-viral, e.g., anti-HIV, activity of the
      griffithsins and conjugates thereof of the invention can be
      further demonstrated in a series of interrelated in vitro
      anti-viral assays (Gulakowski et al., J. Virol. Methods, 33:
      87-100 (1991)), which accurately predict for anti-viral activity
      in humans. These assays measure the ability of compounds to
      prevent the replication of HIV and/or the cytopathic effects of
      HIV on human target cells. These measurements directly correlate
      with the pathogenesis of HIV-induced disease in vivo. The results
      of the analysis of the anti-viral activity of griffithsins or
      conjugates, as set forth in Examples 5-7 and 9, predict accurately
      the anti-viral activity of these products in vivo in humans and,
      therefore, establish the utility of the invention. Furthermore,
      since the invention also provides methods of ex vivo use of
      griffithsins and conjugates, the utility of griffithsins and
      conjugates thereof is even more certain.<br>
      <br>
      [0070] The griffithsins and conjugates thereof of the invention
      can be shown to inhibit a virus, specifically a retrovirus, more
      specifically an immunodeficiency virus, such as the human
      immunodeficiency virus, i.e., HIV-1 or HIV-2. The griffithsins and
      conjugates of the invention can be used to inhibit other
      retroviruses as well as other viruses (see, e.g., Principles of
      Virology: Molecular Biology, Pathogenesis, and Control, Flint et
      al., eds., ASM Press: Washington, D.C. (2000), particularly
      Chapter 19). Examples of viruses that may be treated in accordance
      with the invention include, but are not limited to, Type C and
      Type D retroviruses, HTLV-1, HTLV-2, HIV, FIV, FLV, SIV, MLV, BLV,
      BIV, equine infectious virus, anemia virus, avian sarcoma viruses,
      such as Rous sarcoma virus (RSV), hepatitis type A, B, non-A and
      non-B viruses, arboviruses, varicella viruses, human herpes virus
      (e.g., HHV-6), measles, mumps, filovirus (e.g., Ebola, such as
      Ebola strains Sudan, Zaire, Cote d'Ivoire, and Reston) and rubella
      viruses. Griffithsins and conjugate thereof also can be used to
      inhibit influenza viral infection (see, e.g., Fields Virology,
      third edition, Fields et al., eds., Lippincott-Raven Publishers:
      Philadelphia, Pa. (1996), particularly Chapter 45)
      prophylactically and therapeutically in accordance with the
      methods set forth herein.<br>
      <br>
      [0071] Thus, the invention further provides a composition
      comprising (i) one or more of an above-described purified or
      isolated nucleic acid or variant thereof, optionally as part of an
      encoded fusion protein, and (ii) a carrier, excipient or adjuvant.
      Preferably, (i) is present in an antiviral effective amount and
      the composition is pharmaceutically acceptable. The composition
      can further comprise at least one additional active agent, such as
      an antiviral agent other than a griffithsin (or antiviral
      fragment, fusion protein or conjugate thereof), in an antiviral
      effective amount. Suitable antiviral agents include AZT, ddA, ddI,
      ddC, 3TC gancyclovir, fluorinated dideoxynucleosides, acyclovir,
      [alpha]-interferon, nonnucleoside analog compounds, such as
      nevirapine (Shih et al., PNAS, 88: 9878-9882, (1991)), TIBO
      derivatives, such as R82913 (White et al., Antiviral Res., 16:
      257-266 (1991)), Ro31-8959, BI-RJ-70 (Merigan, Am. J. Med., 90
      (Suppl. 4A): 8S-17S (1991)), michellamines (Boyd et al., J. Med.
      Chem., 37: 1740-1745 (1994)) and calanolides (Kashman et al., J.
      Med. Chem., 35: 2735-2743 (1992)), nonoxynol-9, gossypol and
      derivatives, gramicidin, Enfurtide (i.e., T20), cyanovirin-N and
      functional homologs thereof (Boyd et al. (1997), supra). Other
      exemplary antiviral compounds include protease inhibitors (see R.
      C. Ogden and C. W. Flexner, eds., Protease Inhibitors in AIDS
      Therapy, Marcel Dekker, N Y (2001)), such as saquinavir (see I. B.
      Duncan and S. Redshaw, in R. C. Ogden and C. W. Flexner, supra,
      pp. 27-48), ritonavir (see D. J. Kempf, in R. C. Ogden and C. W.
      Flexner, supra, pp. 49-64), indinavir (see B. D. Dorsey and J. P.
      Vacca, in R. C. Ogden and C. W. Flexner, supra, pp. 65-84),
      nelfinavir (see S. H. Reich, in R. C. Ogden and C. W. Flexner,
      supra, pp. 85-100), amprenavir (see R. D. Tung, in R. C. Ogden and
      C. W. Flexner, supra, pp. 101-118), and anti-TAT agents. If the
      composition is to be used to induce an immune response, it
      comprises an immune response-inducing amount of the inventive
      agent and can further comprise an immunoadjuvant, such as
      polyphosphazene polyelectrolyte.<br>
      <br>
      [0072] The pharmaceutical composition can contain other
      pharmaceuticals, such as virucides, immunomodulators,
      immunostimulants, antibiotics and absorption enhancers. Exemplary
      immunomodulators and immunostimulants include various
      interleukins, sCD4, cytokines, antibody preparations, blood
      transfusions, and cell transfusions. Exemplary antibiotics include
      antifungal agents, antibacterial agents, and anti-Pneumocystitis
      carnii agents. Exemplary absorption enhancers include bile salts
      and other surfactants, saponins, cyclodextrins, and phospholipids
      (Davis (1992), supra).<br>
      <br>
      [0073] An isolated cell comprising an above-described purified or
      isolated nucleic acid or variant thereof, optionally in the form
      of a vector, which is optionally targeted to a cell-surface
      receptor, is also provided. Examples of host cells include, but
      are not limited to, a human cell, a human cell line, E. coli, B.
      subtilis, P. aerugenosa, S. cerevisiae, and N. crassa. E. coli, in
      particular E. coli TB-1, TG-2, DH5[alpha], XL-Blue MRF'
      (Stratagene), SA2821 and Y1090. Preferably, the cell is a
      mammalian cell, bacterium, or yeast. A preferred bacterium is
      lactobacillus or other commensal microorganism. The
      above-described nucleic acid or variant thereof, optionally in the
      form of a vector, can be introduced into a host cell using such
      techniques as transfection, electroporation, transduction,
      micro-injection, transformation, and the like.<br>
      <br>
      [0074] Accordingly, the invention provides a method of inhibiting
      prophylactically or therapeutically a viral infection, in
      particular an influenza viral infection or HIV infection, of a
      host. The method comprises administering to the host an effective
      amount of an anti-viral polypeptide or anti-viral polypeptide
      conjugate comprising at least eight contiguous amino acids of SEQ
      ID NO: 3, wherein the at least eight contiguous amino acids are
      nonglycosylated and have anti-viral activity, whereupon the viral
      infection is inhibited. The anti-viral polypeptide can be derived
      from a griffithsin obtained from Griffithsia or recombinantly
      produced in accordance with the methods described above.
      Nonglycosylated anti-viral polypeptides can be produced in
      prokaryotic cells/organisms. Amino acids 45, 60, 71, and/or 104 in
      such nonglycosylated antiviral polypeptides can be deleted or
      substituted, for example, with alanine or glutamine.
      Nonglycosylated antiviral polypeptides also can be produced in
      eukaryotic cells/organisms by expressing a portion of a
      griffithsin, such as that of SEQ ID NO: 3, that does not contain a
      glycosylation site or all or a portion of a griffithsin, such as
      that of SEQ ID NO: 3, which contains a glycosylation site that has
      been rendered glycosylation-resistant as described and exemplified
      herein. When the viral infection is an influenza viral infection
      and the anti-viral polypeptide or anti-viral polypeptide conjugate
      is administered topically to the host, preferably the anti-viral
      protein or anti-viral peptide is administered to the respiratory
      system of the host, preferably as an aerosol or microparticulate
      powder.<br>
      <br>
      [0075] The prophylactic and therapeutic treatment of many viral
      infections, including influenza virus infections, is complicated
      by appearance of virus forms resistant to currently employed
      medications, such as neurominidase inhibitors. The inventive
      method is particularly useful in this context, as the inventive
      anti-viral polypeptide or anti-viral polypeptide conjugate binds a
      wide range of glycoproteins present on the viral surface.
      Accordingly, the inventive anti-viral polypeptide or conjugate
      thereof can be administered to an animal, preferably a human, dog,
      cat, bird, cow, pig, horse, lamb, mouse, or rat, in combination
      with other anti-viral agents to guard against the propagation of
      anti-viral-resistant strains of virus. In addition, it is thought
      that during adaptive mutation (e.g., resistance to neuraminidase
      inhibitors), the level of glycosylation found at the viral surface
      increases in some viruses, such as influenza. Thus, in that the
      inventive anti-viral agent binds sugars of viral surface
      glycoproteins, the inventive method provides a valuable
      complimentary therapy to current anti-viral regimens.<br>
      <br>
      [0076] Griffithsins and conjugates thereof collectively comprise
      polypeptides and proteins, and, as such, are particularly
      susceptible to hydrolysis of amide bonds (e.g., catalyzed by
      peptidases) and disruption of essential disulfide bonds or
      formation of inactivating or unwanted disulfide linkages (Carone
      et al., J. Lab. Clin. Med., 100:1-14 (1982)). There are various
      ways to alter molecular structure, if necessary, to provide
      enhanced stability to the griffithsin or conjugate thereof
      (Wunsch, Biopolymers, 22: 493-505 (1983); and Samanen, in
      Polymeric Materials in Medication, Gebelein et al., eds., Plenum
      Press: New York (1985) pp. 227-242), which may be essential for
      preparation and use of pharmaceutical compositions containing
      griffithsins or conjugates thereof for therapeutic or prophylactic
      applications against viruses, e.g., HIV. Possible options for
      useful chemical modifications of a griffithsin or conjugate
      include, but are not limited to, the following (adapted from
      Samanen, J. M. (1985) supra): (a) olefin substitution, (b)
      carbonyl reduction, (c) D-amino acid substitution, (d) N-methyl
      substitution, (e) C-methyl substitution, (f) C-C'-methylene
      insertion, (g) dehydro amino acid insertion, (h) retro-inverso
      modification, (i) N-terminal to C-terminal cyclization, and (j)
      thiomethylene modification. Griffithsins and conjugates thereof
      also can be modified by covalent attachment of carbohydrate and
      polyoxyethylene derivatives, which are expected to enhance
      stability and resistance to proteolysis (Abuchowski et al., in
      Enzymes as Drugs, Holcenberg et al., eds., John Wiley: New York
      (1981), pp. 367-378).<br>
      <br>
      [0077] Other important general considerations for design of
      delivery strategy systems and compositions, and for routes of
      administration, for protein and peptide drugs, such as
      griffithsins and conjugates thereof (Eppstein, CRC Crit. Rev.
      Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems, 5: 99-139 (1988); Siddiqui et
      al., CRC Crit. Rev. Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems, 3: 195-208
      (1987); Banga et al., Int. J. Pharmaceutics, 48: 15-50 (1988);
      Sanders, Eur. J. Drug Metab. Pharmacokinetics, 15: 95-102 (1990);
      and Verhoef, Eur. J. Drug Metab. Pharmacokinetics, 15: 83-93
      (1990)), also apply. The appropriate delivery system for a given
      griffithsin or conjugate thereof will depend upon its particular
      nature, the particular clinical application, and the site of drug
      action. As with any protein or peptide drug, oral delivery of a
      griffithsin or a conjugate thereof will likely present special
      problems, due primarily to instability in the gastrointestinal
      tract and poor absorption and bioavailability of intact, bioactive
      drug therefrom. Therefore, especially in the case of oral
      delivery, but also possibly in conjunction with other routes of
      delivery, it will be necessary to use an absorption-enhancing
      agent in combination with a given griffithsin or conjugate thereof
      A wide variety of absorption-enhancing agents have been
      investigated and/or applied in combination with protein and
      peptide drugs for oral delivery and for delivery by other routes
      (Verhoef (1990), supra; van Hoogdalem, Pharmac. Ther., 44: 407-443
      (1989); and Davis, J. Pharm. Pharmacol, 44 (Suppl. 1): 186-190
      (1992)). Most commonly, typical enhancers fall into the general
      categories of (a) chelators, such as EDTA, salicylates, and N-acyl
      derivatives of collagen, (b) surfactants, such as lauryl sulfate
      and polyoxyethylene-9-lauryl ether, (c) bile salts, such as
      glycholate and taurocholate, and derivatives, such as
      taurodihydrofusidate, (d) fatty acids, such as oleic acid and
      capric acid, and their derivatives, such as acylcarnitines,
      monoglycerides and diglycerides, (e) non-surfactants, such as
      unsaturated cyclic ureas, (f) saponins, (g) cyclodextrins, and (h)
      phospholipids.<br>
      <br>
      [0078] Other approaches to enhancing oral delivery of protein and
      peptide drugs, such as the griffithsins and conjugates thereof,
      can include aforementioned chemical modifications to enhance
      stability to gastrointestinal enzymes and/or increased
      lipophilicity. Alternatively, or in addition, the protein or
      peptide drug can be administered in combination with other drugs
      or substances, which directly inhibit proteases and/or other
      potential sources of enzymatic degradation of proteins and
      peptides. Yet another alternative approach to prevent or delay
      gastrointestinal absorption of protein or peptide drugs, such as
      griffithsins or conjugates, is to incorporate them into a delivery
      system that is designed to protect the protein or peptide from
      contact with the proteolytic enzymes in the intestinal lumen and
      to release the intact protein or peptide only upon reaching an
      area favorable for its absorption. A more specific example of this
      strategy is the use of biodegradable microcapsules or
      microspheres, both to protect vulnerable drugs from degradation,
      as well as to effect a prolonged release of active drug (Deasy, in
      Microencapsulation and Related Processes, Swarbrick, ed., Marcell
      Dekker, Inc.: New York (1984), pp. 1-60, 88-89, 208-211).
      Microcapsules also can provide a useful way to effect a prolonged
      delivery of a protein and peptide drug, such as a griffithsin or
      conjugate thereof, after injection (Maulding, J. Controlled
      Release, 6: 167-176 (1987)).<br>
      <br>
      [0079] Given the aforementioned potential complexities of
      successful oral delivery of a protein or peptide drug, it is
      fortunate that there are numerous other potential routes of
      delivery of a protein or peptide drug, such as a griffithsin or
      conjugate thereof. These routes include topical, subcutaneous,
      intravenous, intraarterial, intrathecal, intracisternal, buccal,
      rectal, nasal, pulmonary, transdermal, vaginal, ocular, and the
      like (Eppstein (1988), supra; Siddiqui et al. (1987), supra; Banga
      et al. (1988), supra; Sanders (1990), supra; Verhoef (1990),
      supra; Barry, in Delivery Systems for Peptide Drugs, Davis et al.,
      eds., Plenum Press: New York (1986), pp. 265-275; and Patton et
      al., Adv. Drug Delivery Rev, 8: 179-196 (1992)). With any of these
      routes, or, indeed, with any other route of administration or
      application, a protein or peptide drug, such as a griffithsin or
      conjugate thereof, may initiate an immunogenic reaction. In such
      situations it may be necessary to modify the molecule in order to
      mask immunogenic groups. It also can be possible to protect
      against undesired immune responses by judicious choice of method
      of formulation and/or administration. For example, site-specific
      delivery can be employed, as well as masking of recognition sites
      from the immune system by use or attachment of a so-called
      tolerogen, such as polyethylene glycol, dextran, albumin, and the
      like (Abuchowski et al. (1981), supra; Abuchowski et al., J. Biol.
      Chem., 252: 3578-3581 (1977); Lisi et al., J. Appl. Biochem, 4:
      19-33 (1982); and Wileman et al., J. Pharm. Pharmacol, 38: 264-271
      (1986)). Such modifications also can have advantageous effects on
      stability and half-life both in vivo and ex vivo.<br>
      <br>
      [0080] Procedures for covalent attachment of molecules, such as
      polyethylene glycol, dextran, albumin and the like, to proteins,
      such as griffithsins or conjugates thereof, are well-known to
      those skilled in the art, and are extensively documented in the
      literature (e.g., see Davis et al., in Peptide and Protein Drug
      Delivery, Lee, ed., Marcel Dekker: New York (1991), pp. 831-864).<br>
      <br>
      [0081] Other strategies to avoid untoward immune reactions also
      can include the induction of tolerance by administration initially
      of only low doses. In any event, it will be apparent from the
      present disclosure to one skilled in the art that for any
      particular desired medical application or use of a griffithsin or
      conjugate thereof, the skilled artisan can select from any of a
      wide variety of possible compositions, routes of administration,
      or sites of application, what is advantageous.<br>
      <br>
      [0082] Accordingly, the anti-viral griffithsins and conjugates
      thereof of the invention can be formulated into various
      compositions for use, for example, either in therapeutic treatment
      methods for infected individuals, or in prophylactic methods
      against viral, e.g., HIV and influenza virus, infection of
      uninfected individuals.<br>
      <br>
      [0083] The invention also provides a composition, such as a
      pharmaceutical composition, which comprises an isolated and
      purified griffithsin, a griffithsin conjugate, a matrix-anchored
      griffithsin or a matrix-anchored griffithsin conjugate, such as an
      anti-viral effective amount thereof. The composition can further
      comprise a carrier, such as a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.
      The composition can further comprise at least one additional
      anti-viral compound other than a griffithsin or conjugate thereof,
      such as in an anti-viral effective amount of an anti-viral
      compound. Suitable anti-viral compounds include cyanovirin, AZT,
      ddI, ddC, gancyclovir, fluorinated dideoxynucleosides, nevirapine,
      R82913, Ro 31-8959, BI-RJ-70, acyclovir, [alpha]-interferon,
      recombinant sCD4, michellamines, calanolides, nonoxynol-9,
      gossypol and derivatives thereof, neuroamidase inhibitors,
      amantatadine, rimantadine, enfurtide, and gramicidin. If the
      composition is to be used to induce an immune response, it
      comprises an immune response-inducing amount of a griffithsin or
      conjugate thereof and can further comprise an immunoadjuvant, such
      as polyphosphazene polyelectrolyte. The griffithsin used in the
      composition, e.g., pharmaceutical composition, can be isolated and
      purified from nature or genetically engineered. Similarly, the
      griffithsin conjugate can be genetically engineered or chemically
      coupled.<br>
      <br>
      [0084] The inventive compositions can be administered to a host,
      such as a human, so as to inhibit viral infection in a
      prophylactic or therapeutic method. The compositions of the
      invention are particularly useful in inhibiting the growth or
      replication of a virus, such as influenza virus or a retrovirus,
      in particular an influenza virus or an immunodeficiency virus,
      such as HIV, specifically HIV-1 and HIV-2, inhibiting infectivity
      of the virus, inhibiting the binding of virus to a host cell, and
      the like. The compositions are useful in the therapeutic or
      prophylactic treatment of animals, such as humans, who are
      infected with a virus or who are at risk for viral infection,
      respectively. The compositions also can be used to treat objects
      or materials, such as medical equipment, supplies, or fluids,
      including biological fluids, such as blood, blood products and
      vaccine formulations, cells, tissues and organs, to remove or
      inactivate virus in an effort to prevent or treat viral infection
      of an animal, such as a human. Such compositions also are useful
      to prevent sexual transmission of viral infections, e.g., HIV,
      which is the primary way in which the world's AIDS cases are
      contracted (Merson (1993), supra). Adherence of the inventive
      anti-viral polypeptide or conjugate thereof to a solid support,
      such as a filter, can be used in clinics to remove all or part of
      the viral content of a biological solution. For example, filters
      comprising the inventive anti-viral agents can be used to treat
      blood supplies prior to transfusion to reduce the risk of viral
      transmission. Such filters would find particular utility in
      clinics wherein risk of viral infection is high. It will be
      appreciated that total removal of the viral content of a
      biological solution is not required to achieve a beneficial
      effect. Removal of even a fraction of virus from a biological
      solution decreases the risk of infection of a patient.<br>
      <br>
      [0085] Potential virucides used or being considered for use
      against sexual transmission of HIV are very limited; present
      agents in this category include, for example, nonoxynol-9 (Bird,
      AIDS, 5: 791-796 (1991)), gossypol and derivatives (Polsky et al.,
      Contraception, 39: 579-587 (1989); Lin, Antimicrob. Agents
      Chemother, 33: 2149-2151 (1989); and Royer, Pharmacol. Res, 24:
      407-412 (1991)), and gramicidin (Bourinbair, Life Sci./Pharmacol.
      Lett, 54: PL5-9 (1994); and Bourinbair et al., Contraception, 49:
      131-137 (1994)). The method of prevention of sexual transmission
      of viral infection, e.g., HIV infection, in accordance with the
      invention comprises vaginal, rectal, oral, penile or other topical
      treatment with an anti-viral effective amount of a griffithsin
      and/or griffithsin conjugate, alone or in combination with another
      anti-viral compound as described herein.<br>
      <br>
      [0086] In a novel approach to anti-HIV prophylaxis pursued under
      auspices of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
      Diseases (NIAID) (e.g., as conveyed by Painter, USA Today, Feb.
      13, 1996), vaginal suppository instillation of live cultures of
      lactobacilli was being evaluated in a 900-woman study. This study
      was based especially upon observations of anti-HIV effects of
      certain H2O2-producing lactobacilli in vitro (e.g., see published
      abstract by Hilier, from NIAID-sponsored Conference on "Advances
      in AIDS Vaccine Development," Bethesda, Md., Feb. 11-15, 1996).
      Lactobacilli readily populate the vagina, and indeed are a
      predominant bacterial population in most healthy women
      (Redondo-Lopez et al., Rev. Infect. Dis., 12: 856-872 (1990); Reid
      et al., Clin. Microbiol. Rev., 3: 335-344 (1990); Bruce and Reid,
      Can. J. Microbiol., 34: 339-343 (1988); Reu et al., J. Infect.
      Dis., 171: 1237-1243 (1995); Hilier et al., Clin. Infect. Dis., 16
      (Suppl 4): S273-S281; and Agnew et al., Sex. Transm. Dis., 22:
      269-273 (1995)). Lactobacilli are also prominent, nonpathogenic
      inhabitants of other body cavities such as the mouth, nasopharynx,
      upper and lower gastrointestinal tracts, and rectum.<br>
      <br>
      [0087] It is well-established that lactobacilli can be readily
      transduced using available genetic engineering techniques to
      incorporate a desired foreign DNA coding sequence, and that such
      lactobacilli can be made to express a corresponding desired
      foreign protein (see, e.g., Hols et al., Appl. and Environ.
      Microbiol., 60: 1401-1413 (1994)). Therefore, within the context
      of the present disclosure, it will be appreciated by one skilled
      in the art that viable host cells containing a DNA sequence or
      vector of the invention, and expressing a polypeptide or fusion
      protein of the invention, can be used directly as the delivery
      vehicle for a griffithsin or fusion protein thereof to the desired
      site(s) in vivo. Preferred host cells for such delivery of
      griffithsins or fusion proteins thereof directly to desired
      site(s), such as, for example, to a selected body cavity, can
      comprise bacteria or yeast. More specifically, such host cells can
      comprise suitably engineered strain(s) of lactobacilli,
      enterococci, or other common bacteria, such as E. coli, normal
      strains of which are known to commonly populate body cavities.
      More specifically yet, such host cells can comprise one or more
      selected nonpathogenic strains of lactobacilli, such as those
      described by Andreu et al. ((1995), supra), especially those
      having high adherence properties to epithelial cells, such as, for
      example, adherence to vaginal epithelial cells, and suitably
      transformed using the DNA sequences of the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0088] As reviewed by McGroarty (FEMS Immunol. Med. Microbiol., 6:
      251-264 (1993)) the "probiotic" or direct therapeutic application
      of live bacteria, particularly bacteria that occur normally in
      nature, more particularly lactobacilli, for treatment or
      prophylaxis against pathogenic bacterial or yeast infections of
      the urogenital tract, in particular the female urogenital tract,
      is a well-established concept. Recently, the use of a conventional
      probiotic strategy, in particular the use of live lactobacilli, to
      inhibit sexual transmission of HIV has been suggested, based
      specifically upon the normal, endogenous production of virucidal
      levels of H2O2 and/or lactic acid and/or other potentially
      virucidal substances by certain normal strains of lactobacilli
      (e.g., Hilier (1996), supra). However, the inventive use of
      non-mammalian cells, particularly bacteria, more particularly
      lactobacilli, specifically engineered with a foreign gene, more
      specifically a griffithsin gene, to express an anti-viral
      substance, more specifically a protein, and even more specifically
      a griffithsin, is heretofore unprecedented as a method of
      treatment of an animal, specifically a human, to prevent infection
      by a virus, specifically a retrovirus, more specifically HIV-1 or
      HIV-2.<br>
      <br>
      [0089] Elmer et al. (JAMA, 275: 870-876 (1996)) have recently
      speculated that "genetic engineering offers the possibility of
      using microbes to deliver specific actions or products to the
      colon or other mucosal surfaces . . . other fertile areas for
      future study include defining the mechanisms of action of various
      biotherapeutic agents with the possibility of applying genetic
      engineering to enhance activities." Elmer et al. ((1996), supra)
      further point out that the terms "probiotic" and "biotherapeutic
      agent" have been used in the literature to describe microorganisms
      that have antagonistic activity toward pathogens in vivo; those
      authors more specifically prefer the term "biotherapeutic agent"
      to denote "microorganisms having specific therapeutic properties."<br>
      <br>
      [0090] In view of the present disclosure, one skilled in the art
      will appreciate that the invention teaches an entirely novel type
      of "probiotic" or "biotherapeutic" treatment using specifically
      engineered strains of microorganisms provided herein which do not
      occur in nature. Nonetheless, available teachings concerning
      selection of optimal microbial strains, in particular bacterial
      strains, for conventional probiotic or biotherapeutic applications
      can be employed in the context of the invention. For example,
      selection of optimal lactobacillus strains for genetic
      engineering, transformation, direct expression of griffithsins or
      conjugates thereof, and direct probiotic or biotherapeutic
      applications, to treat or prevent viral (e.g., HIV) infection, can
      be based upon the same or similar criteria, such as those
      described by Elmer et al. ((1996), supra), typically used to
      select normal, endogenous or "nonengineered" bacterial strains for
      conventional probiotic or biotherapeutic therapy. Furthermore, the
      recommendations and characteristics taught by McGroarty,
      particularly for selection of optimal lactobacillus strains for
      conventional probiotic use against female urogenital infections,
      are pertinent to the present invention: " . . . lactobacilli
      chosen for incorporation into probiotic preparations should be
      easy and, if possible, inexpensive to cultivate . . . strains
      should be stable, retain viability following freeze-drying and, of
      course, be non-pathogenic to the host . . . it is essential that
      lactobacilli chosen for use in probiotic preparations should
      adhere well to the vaginal epithelium . . . ideally, artificially
      implanted lactobacilli should adhere to the vaginal epithelium,
      integrate with the indigenous microorganisms present, and
      proliferate" (McGroarty (1993), supra). While McGroarty's
      teachings specifically address selections of "normal"
      lactobacillus strains for probiotic uses against pathogenic
      bacterial or yeast infections of the female urogenital tract,
      similar considerations will apply to the selection of optimal
      bacterial strains for genetic engineering and "probiotic" or
      "biotherapeutic" application against viral infections as
      particularly encompassed by the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0091] Accordingly, the method of the invention for the prevention
      of sexual transmission of viral infection, e.g., HIV infection,
      comprises vaginal, rectal, oral, penile, or other topical,
      insertional, or instillational treatment with an anti-viral
      effective amount of a griffithsin, a griffithsin conjugate or
      fusion protein, a matrix-anchored griffithsin or conjugate or
      fusion protein thereof, and/or viable host cells transformed to
      express a griffithsin or conjugate or fusion protein thereof,
      alone or in combination with one or more other anti-viral compound
      (e.g., as described above). However, commensal organisms which
      produce griffithsin or a fragment, homolog, or conjugate thereof
      can inhibit viruses other than HIV. For example, commensal
      microorganisms that produce the inventive polypeptide can be
      instilled in mucosal tissue at the site of influenza contact, such
      as nasal or oral mucosa, to inhibit influenza infection of a host.<br>
      <br>
      [0092] Compositions for use in the prophylactic or therapeutic
      treatment methods of the invention comprise one or more
      griffithsin(s) or conjugate(s) or fusion protein(s) thereof,
      either one of which can be matrix-anchored, and desirably a
      carrier therefor, such as a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.
      Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers are well-known to those who
      are skilled in the art, as are suitable methods of administration.
      The choice of carrier will be determined in part by the particular
      griffithsin or conjugate or fusion protein thereof, as well as by
      the particular method used to administer the composition.<br>
      <br>
      [0093] One skilled in the art will appreciate that various routes
      of administering a drug are available, and, although more than one
      route can be used to administer a particular drug, a particular
      route can provide a more immediate and more effective reaction
      than another route. For example, the anti-viral agent of the
      invention can be inhaled in methods of prophylactically treating a
      subject for influenza infection. Delivery of the anti-viral agent
      to a location of initial viral contact, such as the nose or mouth,
      blocks the onset of infection. The anti-viral agent can be
      administered via subcutaneous injection. Alternatively, in acute
      or critical medical situations, the anti-viral agent can be
      administered intravenously. In many cases of infection, a patient
      generates an immune response to a virus. However, the effects of
      the viral infection so severely compromise the health of the
      patient that an effective immune response is not reached prior to
      death. Administration of the anti-viral agent can prolong the life
      of the patient until a patient's natural immune defense clears the
      virus. Furthermore, one skilled in the art will appreciate that
      the particular pharmaceutical carrier employed will depend, in
      part, upon the particular griffithsin or conjugate or fusion
      protein thereof employed, and the chosen route of administration.
      Accordingly, there is a wide variety of suitable formulations of
      the composition of the invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0094] Formulations suitable for oral administration can consist
      of liquid solutions, such as an effective amount of the compound
      dissolved in diluents, such as water, saline, or fruit juice;
      capsules, sachets or tablets, each containing a predetermined
      amount of the active ingredient, as solid, granules or
      freeze-dried cells; solutions or suspensions in an aqueous liquid;
      and oil-in-water emulsions or water-in-oil emulsions. Tablet forms
      can include one or more of lactose, mannitol, corn starch, potato
      starch, microcrystalline cellulose, acacia, gelatin, colloidal
      silicon dioxide, croscarmellose sodium, talc, magnesium stearate,
      stearic acid, and other excipients, colorants, diluents, buffering
      agents, moistening agents, preservatives, flavoring agents, and
      pharmacologically compatible carriers. Suitable formulations for
      oral delivery can also be incorporated into synthetic and natural
      polymeric microspheres, or other means to protect the agents of
      the present invention from degradation within the gastrointestinal
      tract (see, for example, Wallace et al., Science, 260: 912-915
      (1993)).<br>
      <br>
      [0095] The anti-viral agent of the invention (e.g., griffithsin or
      conjugates thereof), alone or in combination with other anti-viral
      compounds, can be made into aerosol formulations or
      microparticulate powder formulations to be administered via
      inhalation. These aerosol formulations can be placed into
      pressurized acceptable propellants, such as
      dichlorodifluoromethane, propane, nitrogen, and the like.<br>
      <br>
      [0096] The anti-viral agent of the invention (e.g., griffithsin or
      conjugates thereof), alone or in combinations with other
      anti-viral compounds or absorption modulators, can be made into
      suitable formulations for transdermal application and absorption,
      such as a patch (Wallace et al. (1993), supra). Transdermal
      electroporation or iontophoresis also can be used to promote
      and/or control the systemic delivery of the compounds and/or
      compositions of the present invention through the skin (e.g., see
      Theiss et al., Meth. Find. Exp. Clin. Pharmacol., 13: 353-359
      (1991)).<br>
      <br>
      [0097] Formulations suitable for topical administration include
      lozenges comprising the active ingredient in a flavor, usually
      sucrose and acacia or tragacanth; pastilles comprising the active
      ingredient in an inert base, such as gelatin and glycerin, or
      sucrose and acacia; and mouthwashes comprising the active
      ingredient in a suitable liquid carrier; as well as creams,
      emulsions, gels and the like containing, in addition to the active
      ingredient, such as, for example, freeze-dried lactobacilli or
      live lactobacillus cultures genetically engineered to directly
      produce a griffithsin or conjugate or fusion protein thereof of
      the present invention, such carriers as are known in the art.
      Topical administration is preferred for the prophylactic and
      therapeutic treatment of influenza viral infection, such as
      through the use of an inhaler, for example.<br>
      <br>
      [0098] Formulations for rectal administration can be presented as
      a suppository with a suitable base comprising, for example, cocoa
      butter or a salicylate. Formulations suitable for vaginal
      administration can be presented as pessaries, tampons, creams,
      gels, pastes, foams, or spray formulas containing, in addition to
      the active ingredient, such as, for example, freeze-dried
      lactobacilli or live lactobacillus cultures genetically engineered
      to directly produce a griffithsin or conjugate or fusion protein
      thereof of the present invention, such carriers as are known in
      the art to be appropriate. Similarly, the active ingredient can be
      combined with a lubricant as a coating on a condom. Indeed,
      preferably, the active ingredient is applied to any contraceptive
      device, including, but not limited to, a condom, a diaphragm, a
      cervical cap, a vaginal ring, and a sponge.<br>
      <br>
      [0099] Formulations suitable for parenteral administration include
      aqueous and non-aqueous, isotonic sterile injection solutions,
      which can contain anti-oxidants, buffers, bacteriostats, and
      solutes that render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the
      intended recipient, and aqueous and non-aqueous sterile
      suspensions that can include suspending agents, solubilizers,
      thickening agents, stabilizers, and preservatives. The
      formulations can be presented in unit-dose or multi-dose sealed
      containers, such as ampules and vials, and can be stored in a
      freeze-dried (lyophilized) condition requiring only the addition
      of the sterile liquid carrier, for example, water, for injections,
      immediately prior to use. Extemporaneous injection solutions and
      suspensions can be prepared from sterile powders, granules, and
      tablets of the kind previously described.<br>
      <br>
      [0100] Formulations comprising a griffithsin or griffithsin
      conjugate suitable for virucidal (e.g., HIV) sterilization of
      inanimate objects, such as medical supplies or equipment,
      laboratory equipment and supplies, instruments, devices, and the
      like, can, for example, be selected or adapted as appropriate, by
      one skilled in the art, from any of the aforementioned
      compositions or formulations. Preferably, the griffithsin is
      produced by recombinant DNA technology. The griffithsin conjugate
      can be produced by recombinant DNA technology or by chemical
      coupling of a griffithsin with an effector molecule as described
      above. Similarly, formulations suitable for ex vivo sterilization,
      inactivation, or removal of virus, such as infectious virus, from
      a sample, such as blood, blood products, sperm, or other bodily
      products, such as a fluid, cells, a tissue or an organ, or any
      other solution, suspension, emulsion, vaccine formulation (such as
      in the removal of infectious virus), or any other material which
      can be administered to a patient in a medical procedure, can be
      selected or adapted as appropriate by one skilled in the art, from
      any of the aforementioned compositions or formulations. However,
      suitable formulations for ex vivo sterilization or inactivation or
      removal of virus from a sample or on an inanimate object are by no
      means limited to any of the aforementioned formulations or
      compositions. For example, such formulations or compositions can
      comprise a functional griffithsin, such as that which is encoded
      by SEQ ID NO: 3, or anti-viral fragment thereof, such as a
      fragment comprising at least eight contiguous amino acids of SEQ
      ID NO: 3, wherein the at least eight contiguous amino acids bind
      to a virus, or a conjugate or fusion protein of either of the
      foregoing, attached to a solid support matrix, to facilitate
      contacting or binding infectious virus in a sample or removing
      infectious virus from a sample as described above, e.g., a bodily
      product such as a fluid, cells, a tissue or an organ from an
      organism, in particular a mammal, such as a human, including, for
      example, blood, a component of blood (e.g., plasma, blood cells,
      and the like), or sperm. Preferably, the anti-viral polypeptide
      comprises SEQ ID NO: 3. Also preferably, the at least eight
      contiguous amino acids bind gp120 of HIV, in particular infectious
      HIV. As a more specific example, such a formulation or composition
      can comprise a functional griffithsin, or conjugate or fusion
      protein thereof, attached to (e.g., coupled to or immobilized on)
      a solid support matrix comprising magnetic beads, to facilitate
      contacting, binding and removal of infectious virus, and to enable
      magnet-assisted removal of the virus from a sample as described
      above, e.g., a bodily product such as a fluid, cells, a tissue or
      an organ, e.g., blood, a component of blood, or sperm.
      Alternatively, and also preferably, the solid support matrix
      comprises a contraceptive device, such as a condom, a diaphragm, a
      cervical cap, a vaginal ring, or a sponge. The anti-viral agent
      also can be encapsulated or dispersed within a solid matrix, such
      as a vaginal ring or sponge. Methods for encapsulating
      biotherapeutics into, for example, biocompatible sustained release
      devices, are known in the art.<br>
      <br>
      [0101] As an even more specific illustration, such a composition
      (e.g., for ex vivo) can comprise a functional (e.g.,
      gp120-binding, HIV-inactivating) griffithsin, or conjugate or
      fusion protein thereof, attached to a solid support matrix, such
      as magnetic beads or a flow-through matrix, by means of an
      anti-griffithsin antibody or at least one effector component,
      which can be the same or different, such as polyethylene glycol,
      albumin, or dextran. The conjugate can further comprise at least
      one effector component, which can be the same or different,
      selected from the group consisting of, for example, an
      immunological reagent and a toxin. A flow-through matrix would
      comprise, for instance, a configuration similar to an affinity
      column. The griffithsin can be covalently coupled to a solid
      support matrix via an anti-griffithsin antibody, described below.
      Methods of attaching an antibody to a solid support matrix are
      well-known in the art (see, for example, Harlow and Lane.
      Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Springs Harbor Laboratory:
      Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. (1988)). Alternatively, the solid support
      matrix, such as magnetic beads, can be coated with streptavidin,
      in which case the griffithsin or fragment thereof (which comprises
      at least eight contiguous amino acids of SEQ ID NO: 3 or SEQ ID
      NO: 2), or a conjugate or fusion protein of either one, is
      biotinylated. The at least eight contiguous amino acids of SEQ ID
      NO: 2 desirably have anti-viral activity and preferably bind gp120
      of HIV, which preferably is infectious. Preferably, the anti-viral
      polypeptide comprises SEQ ID NO: 3 or SEQ ID NO: 2. Such a
      composition can be prepared, for example, by biotinylating the
      griffithsin, or conjugate or fusion protein thereof, and then
      contacting the biotinylated protein or peptide with a
      (commercially available) solid support matrix, such as magnetic
      beads, coated with streptavidin. The use of biotinylation as a
      means to attach a desired biologically active protein or peptide
      to a streptavidin-coated support matrix, such as magnetic beads,
      is well-known in the art.<br>
      <br>
      [0102] One skilled in the art will appreciate that a suitable or
      appropriate formulation can be selected, adapted or developed
      based upon the particular application at hand.<br>
      <br>
      [0103] For ex vivo uses, such as virucidal treatments of inanimate
      objects or materials, blood or blood products, or tissues, the
      amount of griffithsin, conjugate thereof, fusion protein thereof,
      or composition of any of the foregoing, to be employed should be
      sufficient that any virus or virus-producing cells present will be
      rendered noninfectious or will be destroyed. For example, for HIV,
      this would require that the virus and/or the virus-producing cells
      be exposed to concentrations of griffithsin in the range of
      0.1-1000 nM. Similar considerations apply to in vivo applications.
      Therefore, the designation of "anti-viral effective amount" is
      used generally to describe the amount of a particular griffithsin,
      conjugate, fusion protein, or composition thereof required for
      anti-viral efficacy in any given application.<br>
      <br>
      [0104] In view of the above, the invention also provides a method
      of inhibiting prophylactically or therapeutically a viral
      infection of a host in which an anti-viral effective amount of an
      above-described anti-viral polypeptide, conjugate, or fusion
      protein is administered to the host. Upon administration of the
      anti-viral effective amount of the anti-viral polypeptide,
      conjugate, or fusion protein, the viral infection is inhibited.<br>
      <br>
      [0105] The invention additionally provides a method of
      prophylactically or therapeutically inhibiting a viral infection
      of a host in which an anti-viral effective amount of a composition
      comprising an isolated and purified anti-viral polypeptide, or
      anti-viral polypeptide conjugate or fusion protein, either one of
      which comprises at least eight contiguous amino acids of SEQ ID
      NO: 3 having anti-viral activity, attached to or encapsulated
      within a solid support matrix is administered to the host. By
      "therapeutically" is meant that the host already has been infected
      with the virus. By "prophylactically" is meant that the host has
      not yet been infected with the virus but is at risk of being
      infected with the virus. Prophylactic treatment is intended to
      encompass any degree of inhibition of viral infection, including,
      but not limited to, complete inhibition, as one of ordinary skill
      in the art will readily appreciate that any degree in inhibition
      of viral infection is advantageous. Preferably, the inventive
      active agent is administered before viral infection or immediately
      upon determination of viral infection and is continuously
      administered until the virus is undetectable. The method
      optionally further comprises the prior, simultaneous or subsequent
      administration, by the same route or a different route, of an
      antiviral agent or another agent that is efficacious in inhibiting
      the viral infection. Upon administration of the anti-viral
      effective amount of the composition, the viral infection is
      inhibited. Preferably, the solid support matrix is a contraceptive
      device, such as a condom, diaphragm, cervical cap, vaginal ring,
      or sponge. In an alternative embodiment, a solid support matrix
      can be surgically implanted and later removed.<br>
      <br>
      [0106] For in vivo uses, the dose of a griffithsin, or conjugate
      or composition thereof, administered to an animal, particularly a
      human, in the context of the invention should be sufficient to
      effect a prophylactic or therapeutic response in the individual
      over a reasonable time frame. The dose used to achieve a desired
      anti-viral concentration in vivo (e.g., 0.1-1000 nM) will be
      determined by the potency of the particular griffithsin or
      conjugate employed, the severity of the disease state of infected
      individuals, as well as, in the case of systemic administration,
      the body weight and age of the infected individual. The size of
      the dose also will be determined by the existence of any adverse
      side effects that may accompany the particular griffithsin, or
      conjugate or composition thereof, employed. It is always
      desirable, whenever possible, to keep adverse side effects to a
      minimum.<br>
      <br>
      [0107] The invention also provides a method of removing virus,
      such as infectious virus, from a sample. The method comprises
      contacting the sample with a composition comprising an isolated
      and purified anti-viral polypeptide or conjugate or fusion protein
      thereof, comprising at least eight contiguous amino acids of SEQ
      ID NO: 3 (or SEQ ID NO: 2). The at least eight contiguous amino
      acids desirably have anti-viral activity and bind to the virus and
      the anti-viral polypeptide (or conjugate or fusion protein of
      either of the foregoing) is attached to a solid support matrix,
      such as a magnetic bead. "Attached" is used herein to refer to
      attachment to (or coupling to) and immobilization in or on a solid
      support matrix. While any means of attachment can be used,
      preferably, attachment is by covalent bonds. The method further
      comprises separating the sample and the composition by any
      suitable means, whereupon the virus, such as infectious virus, is
      removed from the sample. Preferably, the anti-viral polypeptide
      comprises SEQ ID NO: 3 (or SEQ ID NO: 2). In one embodiment, the
      anti-viral polypeptide is conjugated with an anti-griffithsin
      antibody or at least one effector component, which can be the same
      or different, selected from polyethylene glycol, dextran and
      albumin, in which case the anti-viral polypeptide is desirably
      attached to the solid support matrix through at least one effector
      component. The anti-viral polypeptide can be further conjugated
      with at least one effector component, which can be the same or
      different, selected from the group consisting of an immunological
      reagent and a toxin. In another embodiment, the solid support
      matrix is coated with streptavidin and the anti-viral polypeptide
      is biotinylated. Through biotin, the biotinylated anti-viral
      polypeptide is attached to the streptavidin-coated solid support
      matrix. Other types of means, as are known in the art, can be used
      to attach a functional griffithsin (i.e., an anti-viral
      polypeptide or conjugate as described above) to a solid support
      matrix, such as a magnetic bead, in which case contact with a
      magnet is used to separate the sample and the composition.
      Similarly, other types of solid support matrices can be used, such
      as a matrix comprising a porous surface or membrane, over or
      through which a sample is flowed or percolated, thereby
      selectively entrapping or removing infectious virus from the
      sample. The choice of solid support matrix, means of attachment of
      the functional griffithsin to the solid support matrix, and means
      of separating the sample and the matrix-anchored griffithsin will
      depend, in part, on the sample (e.g., fluid vs. tissue) and the
      virus to be removed. It is expected that the use of a selected
      coupling molecule can confer certain desired properties to a
      matrix, comprising a functional griffithsin coupled therewith,
      that may have particularly advantageous properties in a given
      situation. Preferably, the sample is blood, a component of blood,
      sperm, cells, tissue or an organ. Also, preferably the sample is a
      vaccine formulation, in which case the virus that is removed is
      infectious, such as HIV, although HIV, in particular infectious
      HIV, can be removed from other samples in accordance with this
      method.<br>
      <br>
      [0108] For instance, the skilled practitioner might select a
      poly(ethylene glycol) molecule for attaching a functional
      griffithsin to a solid support matrix, thereby to provide a
      matrix-anchored griffithsin, wherein the griffithsin is attached
      to the matrix by a longer "tether" than would be feasible or
      possible for other attachment methods, such as
      biotinylation/streptavidin coupling. A griffithsin coupled by a
      poly(ethylene glycol) "tether" to a solid support matrix (such as
      magnetic beads, porous surface or membrane, and the like) can
      permit optimal exposure of a binding surface, epitope, hydrophobic
      or electrophilic focus, and/or the like, on a functional
      griffithsin in a manner that, in a given situation and/or for a
      particular virus, facilitates the binding and/or inactivation of
      the virus. A preferred solid support matrix is a magnetic bead
      such that separation of the sample and the composition is effected
      by a magnet. In a preferred embodiment of the method, the at least
      eight contiguous amino acids bind gp120 of HIV and HIV is removed
      from the sample.<br>
      <br>
      [0109] Similarly, other types of solid support matrices can be
      used, such as a matrix comprising a porous surface or membrane,
      over or through which a sample is flowed or percolated, thereby
      selectively inhibiting infectious virus (e.g., HIV or influenza)
      in the sample. The choice of solid support matrix, means of
      attachment of the functional griffithsin to the solid support
      matrix, and means of separating the sample and the matrix-anchored
      griffithsin will depend, in part, on the sample (e.g., fluid vs.
      tissue) and the virus to be inhibited. It is expected that the use
      of a selected coupling molecule can confer certain desired
      properties to a matrix, comprising a functional griffithsin
      coupled therewith, that may have particularly advantageous
      properties in a given situation.<br>
      <br>
      [0110] The methods described herein also have utility in real time
      ex vivo inhibition of virus or virus infected cells in a bodily
      fluid, such as blood, e.g., in the treatment of viral infection,
      or in the inhibition of virus in blood or a component of blood,
      e.g., for transfusion, in the inhibition or prevention of viral
      infection. Such methods also have potential utility in dialysis,
      such as kidney dialysis, and in inhibiting virus in sperm obtained
      from a donor for in vitro and in vivo fertilization. The methods
      also have applicability in the context of tissue and organ
      transplantations.<br>
      <br>
      [0111] In summary, a griffithsin attached to a solid support
      matrix, such as a magnetic bead, can be used to remove virus, in
      particular infectious virus, including immunodeficiency virus,
      such as HIV, e.g., HIV-1 or HIV-2, from a sample, such as a sample
      comprising both infectious and noninfectious virus. The inventive
      method also can be used to remove viral glycoprotein presenting
      cells, e.g., infected cells that have, for example, gp120 on their
      surfaces, from a sample.<br>
      <br>
      [0112] The invention, therefore, further provides a composition
      comprising naturally-occurring, non-infectious virus, such as a
      composition produced as described above. The composition can
      further comprise a carrier, such as a biologically or
      pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, and an immuno-adjuvant.
      Preferably, the noninfectious virus is an influenza or an
      immunodeficiency virus, such as HIV, e.g., HIV-1 or HIV-2.
      Alternatively, and also preferably, the noninfectious virus is
      FIV. A composition comprising only naturally-occurring,
      non-infectious virus has many applications in research and the
      prophylactic treatment of a viral infection. In terms of
      prophylactic treatment of a viral infection, the skilled artisan
      will appreciate the need to eliminate completely all infectious
      virus from the composition. If desired, further treatment of the
      composition comprising non-infectious particles with
      virus-inactivating chemicals, such as imines or psoralens, and/or
      pressure or heat inactivation, will further the non-infectious
      nature of the composition. For example, an immune
      response-inducing amount of the inventive composition can be
      administered to an animal at risk for a viral infection in order
      to induce an immune response. The skilled artisan will appreciate
      that such a composition is a significant improvement over
      previously disclosed compositions in that the virus is
      non-infectious and naturally-occurring. Thus, there is no risk of
      inadvertent infection, greater doses can be administered in
      comparison to compositions comprising infectious viral particles,
      and the subsequent immune response will assuredly be directed to
      antigens present on naturally-occurring virus. The composition
      comprising naturally-occurring, non-infectious virus can be
      administered in any manner appropriate to induce an immune
      response. Preferably, the virus is administered, for example,
      intramuscularly, mucosally, intravenously, subcutaneously, or
      topically. Preferably, the composition comprises
      naturally-occurring, non-infectious human immunodeficiency virus
      comprising gp120.<br>
      <br>
      [0113] The composition comprising naturally-occurring,
      non-infectious virus can be combined with various carriers,
      adjuvants, diluents or other anti-viral therapeutics, if desired.
      Appropriate carriers include, for example, ovalbumin, albumin,
      globulins, hemocyanins, and the like. Adjuvants or
      immuno-adjuvants are incorporated in most cases to stimulate
      further the immune system. Any physiologically appropriate
      adjuvant can be used. Suitable adjuvants for inclusion in the
      inventive composition include, for example, aluminum hydroxide,
      beryllium sulfate, silica, kaolin, carbon, bacterial endotoxin,
      saponin, and the like.<br>
      <br>
      [0114] Thus, the invention also provides a method of inducing an
      immune response to a virus in an animal. The method comprises
      administering to the animal an immune response-inducing amount of
      a composition comprising naturally-occurring, non-infectious virus
      as described above.<br>
      <br>
      [0115] The appropriate dose of a composition comprising
      naturally-occurring, non-infectious virus required to induce an
      immune response to the virus in an animal is dependent on numerous
      factors, such as size of the animal and immune competency. The
      amount of composition administered should be sufficient to induce
      a humoral and/or cellular immune response. The amount of
      non-infectious virus in a particular composition can be determined
      using routine methods in the art, such as the Coulter HIV p24
      antigen assay (Coulter Corp., Hialeah, Fla.). Any suitable dose of
      a composition comprising non-infectious virus is appropriate so
      long as an immune response is induced, desirably without the
      appearance of harmful side effects to the host. In this regard,
      compositions comprising from about 10&lt;1 &gt;to about 10&lt;5
      &gt;particles, preferably from about 10&lt;2 &gt;to about 10&lt;4
      &gt;particles, most preferably about 10&lt;3 &gt;particles, are
      suitable for inducing an immune response.<br>
      <br>
      [0116] One of ordinary skill can determine the effectiveness of
      the composition to induce an immune response using routine methods
      known in the art. Cell-mediated response can be determined by
      employing, for example, a virus antigen-stimulated T-cell
      proliferation assay. The presence of a humoral immune response can
      be determined, for instance, with the Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent
      Assay (ELISA). The skilled artisan will appreciate that there are
      numerous other suitable assays for evaluating induction of an
      immune response. To the extent that a dose is inadequate to induce
      an appropriate immune response, "booster" administrations can
      subsequently be administered in order to prompt a more effective
      immune response.<br>
      <br>
      [0117] In terms of administration of the inventive anti-viral
      agents or conjugates thereof, the dosage can be in unit dosage
      form, such as a tablet or capsule. The term "unit dosage form" as
      used herein refers to physically discrete units suitable as
      unitary dosages for human and animal subjects, each unit
      containing a predetermined quantity of a griffithsin or conjugate
      thereof, alone or in combination with other anti-viral agents,
      calculated in an amount sufficient to produce the desired effect
      in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent,
      carrier, or vehicle.<br>
      <br>
      [0118] The specifications for the unit dosage forms of the
      invention depend on the particular griffithsin, or conjugate or
      composition thereof, employed and the effect to be achieved, as
      well as the pharmacodynamics associated with each griffithsin, or
      conjugate or composition thereof, in the host. The dose
      administered should be an "anti-viral effective amount" or an
      amount necessary to achieve an "effective level" in the individual
      patient.<br>
      <br>
      [0119] Since the "effective level" is used as the preferred
      endpoint for dosing, the actual dose and schedule can vary,
      depending upon interindividual differences in pharmacokinetics,
      drug distribution, and metabolism. The "effective level" can be
      defined, for example, as the blood or tissue level (e.g., 0.1-1000
      nM) desired in the patient that corresponds to a concentration of
      one or more griffithsin or conjugate thereof, which inhibits a
      virus, such as HIV, in an assay known to predict for clinical
      anti-viral activity of chemical compounds and biological agents.
      The "effective level" for agents of the invention also can vary
      when the griffithsin, or conjugate or composition thereof, is used
      in combination with AZT or other known anti-viral compounds or
      combinations thereof.<br>
      <br>
      [0120] One skilled in the art can easily determine the appropriate
      dose, schedule, and method of administration for the exact
      formulation of the composition being used, in order to achieve the
      desired "effective concentration" in the individual patient. One
      skilled in the art also can readily determine and use an
      appropriate indicator of the "effective concentration" of the
      compounds of the invention by a direct (e.g., analytical chemical
      analysis) or indirect (e.g., with surrogate indicators such as p24
      or RT) analysis of appropriate patient samples (e.g., blood and/or
      tissues).<br>
      <br>
      [0121] In the treatment of some virally infected individuals, it
      can be desirable to utilize a "mega-dosing" regimen, wherein a
      large dose of the griffithsin or conjugate thereof is
      administered, time is allowed for the drug to act, and then a
      suitable reagent is administered to the individual to inactivate
      the drug.<br>
      <br>
      [0122] The pharmaceutical composition can contain other
      pharmaceuticals, in conjunction with the griffithsin or conjugate
      thereof, when used to therapeutically treat a viral infection,
      such as an influenza infection or an HIV infection which results
      in AIDS. Representative examples of these additional
      pharmaceuticals include anti-viral compounds, virucides,
      immunomodulators, immunostimulants, antibiotics and absorption
      enhancers. Exemplary anti-viral compounds include cyanovirin, AZT,
      ddI, ddC, gancylclovir, fluorinated dideoxynucleosides,
      nonnucleoside analog compounds, such as nevirapine (Shih et al.,
      PNAS, 88: 9878-9882 (1991)), TIBO derivatives, such as R82913
      (White et al., Anti-viral Res., 16: 257-266 (1991)), BI-RJ-70
      (Merigan, Am. J. Med., 90 (Suppl. 4A): 8S-17S (1991)),
      michellamines (Boyd et al., J. Med. Chem., 37: 1740-1745 (1994))
      and calanolides Kashman et al., J. Med. Chem., 35: 2735-2743
      (1992)), nonoxynol-9, gossypol and derivatives, gramicidin
      (Bourinbair et al. (1994), supra), neuraminidase inhibitors,
      amantadine, enfurtide, and the like. Exemplary immunomodulators
      and immunostimulants include various interleukins, sCD4,
      cytokines, antibody preparations, blood transfusions, and cell
      transfusions. Exemplary antibiotics include antifungal agents,
      antibacterial agents, and anti-Pneutnoeystitis carnii agents.
      Exemplary absorption enhancers include bile salts and other
      surfactants, saponins, cyclodextrins, and phospholipids (Davis
      (1992), supra).<br>
      <br>
      [0123] Administration of a griffithsin or conjugate or fusion
      protein thereof with other anti-retroviral agents and particularly
      with known RT inhibitors, such as ddC, AZT, ddI, ddA, or other
      inhibitors that act against other HIV proteins, such as anti-TAT
      agents, is expected to inhibit most or all replicative stages of
      the viral life cycle. The dosages of ddC and AZT used in AIDS or
      ARC patients have been published. A virustatic range of ddC is
      generally between 0.05 [mu]M to 1.0 [mu]M. A range of about
      0.005-0.25 mg/kg body weight is virustatic in most patients. The
      preliminary dose ranges for oral administration are somewhat
      broader, for example 0.001 to 0.25 mg/kg given in one or more
      doses at intervals of 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, etc. hours. Currently, 0.01
      mg/kg body weight ddC given every 8 hrs is preferred. When given
      in combined therapy, the other anti-viral compound, for example,
      can be given at the same time as the griffithsin or conjugate
      thereof or the dosing can be staggered as desired. The two drugs
      also can be combined in a composition. Doses of each can be less
      when used in combination than when either is used alone.<br>
      <br>
      [0124] It will also be appreciated by one skilled in the art that
      a DNA sequence of a griffithsin or conjugate thereof of the
      invention can be inserted ex vivo into mammalian cells previously
      removed from a given animal, in particular a human, host. Such
      cells can be employed to express the corresponding griffithsin or
      conjugate or fusion protein in vivo after reintroduction into the
      host. Feasibility of such a therapeutic strategy to deliver a
      therapeutic amount of an agent in close proximity to the desired
      target cells and pathogens, i.e., virus, more particularly
      retrovirus, specifically HIV and its envelope glycoprotein gp120,
      has been demonstrated in studies with cells engineered ex vivo to
      express sCD4 (Morgan et al. (1994), supra). It is also possible
      that, as an alternative to ex vivo insertion of the DNA sequences
      of the invention, such sequences can be inserted into cells
      directly in vivo, such as by use of an appropriate viral vector.
      Such cells transfected in vivo are expected to produce anti-viral
      amounts of griffithsin or a conjugate or fusion protein thereof
      directly in vivo.<br>
      <br>
      [0125] Given the present disclosure, it will be additionally
      appreciated that a DNA sequence corresponding to a griffithsin or
      conjugate thereof can be inserted into suitable nonmammalian host
      cells, and that such host cells will express therapeutic or
      prophylactic amounts of a griffithsin or conjugate or fusion
      protein thereof directly in vivo within a desired body compartment
      of an animal, in particular a human. Example 5 illustrates the
      transformation and expression of effective virucidal amounts of a
      griffithsin in a non-mammalian cell, more specifically a bacterial
      cell. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, a method of
      female-controllable prophylaxis against HIV infection comprises
      the intravaginal administration and/or establishment of, in a
      female human, a persistent intravaginal population of lactobacilli
      that have been transformed with a coding sequence of the invention
      to produce, over a prolonged time, effective virucidal levels of a
      griffithsin or conjugate thereof, directly on or within the
      vaginal and/or cervical and/or uterine mucosa. It is noteworthy
      that both the World Health Organization (WHO), as well as the U.S.
      National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, have
      pointed to the need for development of female-controlled topical
      microbicides, suitable for blocking the transmission of HIV, as an
      urgent global priority (Lange et al., Lancet, 341: 1356 (1993);
      Fauci, NIAID News, Apr. 27, 1995). A composition comprising the
      inventive anti-viral agent and a solid-support matrix is
      particularly useful in this regard, particularly when the
      solid-support matrix is a contraceptive device, such as a condom,
      a diaphragm, a cervical cap, a vaginal ring, or a sponge. In
      another embodiment, a colony of commensal organisms transduced
      with the nucleic acid of the invention and producing the inventive
      anti-viral agent is applied to mucosal tissue associated with the
      onset of influenza infection, such as respiratory or oral mucosal.<br>
      <br>
      [0126] The invention also provides antibodies directed to the
      polypeptides of the invention. The availability of antibodies to
      any given protein is highly advantageous, as it provides the basis
      for a wide variety of qualitative and quantitative analytical
      methods, separation and purification methods, and other useful
      applications directed to the subject polypeptides. Accordingly,
      given the present disclosure and the polypeptides of the
      invention, it will be readily apparent to one skilled in the art
      that antibodies, in particular antibodies specifically binding to
      a polypeptide of the invention, can be prepared using
      well-established methodologies (e.g., such as the methodologies
      described in detail by Harlow and Lane, in Antibodies. A
      Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring
      Harbor (1988), pp. 1-725). Such antibodies can comprise both
      polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies. Furthermore, such antibodies
      can be obtained and employed either in solution-phase or coupled
      to a desired solid-phase matrix, such as magnetic beads or a flow
      through matrix. Having in hand such antibodies as provided by the
      invention, one skilled in the art will further appreciate that
      such antibodies, in conjunction with well-established procedures
      (e.g., such as described by Harlow and Lane (1988), supra)
      comprise useful methods for the detection, quantification, or
      purification of a griffithsin, conjugate thereof, or host cell
      transformed to produce a griffithsin or conjugate or fusion
      protein thereof. Example 6 further illustrates an antibody that
      specifically binds to a griffithsin. Accordingly, the invention
      further provides a composition comprising an anti-griffithsin
      antibody bound to the anti-viral agent of the invention,
      preferably an anti-viral polypeptide comprising at least eight
      contiguous amino acids of SEQ ID NO: 3.<br>
      <br>
      [0127] Matrix-anchored anti-griffithsin antibodies also can be
      used in a method to remove virus in a sample. Preferably, the
      antibody binds to an epitope of an anti-viral polypeptide of SEQ
      ID NO: 2 or SEQ ID NO: 3. Preferably, the matrix is a solid
      support matrix, such as a magnetic bead or a flow-through matrix.
      If the solid support matrix to which the anti-griffithsin antibody
      is attached comprises magnetic beads, removal of the
      antibody-griffithsin-virus complex can be readily accomplished
      using a magnet.<br>
      <br>
      [0128] In view of the above, the invention provides a method of
      removing virus from a sample. The method comprises (a) contacting
      the sample with a composition comprising an isolated and purified
      anti-viral polypeptide or conjugate or fusion protein thereof,
      wherein (i) the anti-viral polypeptide comprises at least eight
      contiguous amino acids of SEQ ID NO: 3, and (ii) the at least
      eight contiguous amino acids bind to the virus, and (b) contacting
      the sample with an anti-griffithsin antibody attached to a solid
      support matrix, whereupon the anti-griffithsin antibody binds to
      the anti-viral polypeptide or conjugate or fusion protein thereof
      to which is bound the virus, and (c) separating the solid support
      matrix from the sample, whereupon the virus is removed from the
      sample. Preferably, the anti-viral polypeptide comprises SEQ ID
      NO: 3. Desirably, the virus that is removed is infectious, such as
      HIV. The sample can be blood, a component of blood, sperm, cells,
      tissue or an organ.<br>
      <br>
      [0129] The antibody for use in the aforementioned method is an
      antibody that binds to a polypeptide comprising at least eight
      contiguous amino acids of SEQ ID NO: 3, and, which polypeptide can
      bind to and inactivate a virus. The antibody can be coupled to the
      solid support matrix using similar methods and with similar
      considerations as described above for attaching a griffithsin to a
      solid support matrix. For example, coupling methods and molecules
      employed to attach an anti-griffithsin antibody to a solid support
      matrix, such as magnetic beads or a flow-through matrix, can
      employ biotin/streptavidin coupling or coupling through molecules,
      such as polyethylene glycol, albumin or dextran. Also analogously,
      it can be shown that, after such coupling, the matrix-anchored
      anti-griffithsin antibody retains its ability to bind to a
      polypeptide comprising at least eight contiguous amino acids of
      SEQ ID NO: 3, which polypeptide can bind to and inactivate a
      virus.<br>
      <br>
      [0130] The invention also provides an anti-griffithsin antibody
      that is anti-idiotypic in respect to a viral glycoprotein, such as
      gp120, i.e., has an internal image of gp120 of a primate
      immunodeficiency virus. Preferably, the antibody can compete with
      gp120 of a primate immunodeficiency virus for binding to a
      griffithsin. In this regard, the primary immunodeficiency virus
      preferably is HIV-1 or HIV-2 and the griffithsin preferably
      consists essentially of SEQ ID NO: 2 or SEQ ID NO: 3.
      Anti-idiotypic antibodies can be generated in accordance with
      methods known in the art (see, for example, Benjamin, in
      Immunology: a short course, Wiley-Liss, N Y (1996), pp. 436-437;
      Kuby, in Immunology, 3rd ed., Freeman, N.Y. (1997), pp. 455-456;
      Greenspan et al., FASEB J., 7: 437-443 (1993); and Poskitt,
      Vaccine, 9: 792-796 (1991)). Such an anti-idiotypic (in respect to
      gp120) anti-griffithsin antibody is useful in a method of
      inhibiting infection of an animal with a virus as provided herein.<br>
      <br>
      [0131] In view of the above, a griffithsin can be administered to
      an animal, the animal generates anti-griffithsin antibodies, among
      which are antibodies that have an internal image of a viral
      glycoprotein, such as gp120. In accordance with well-known
      methods, polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies can be obtained,
      isolated, and selected. Selection of an anti-griffithsin antibody
      that has an internal image of gp120 can be based upon competition
      between the anti-griffithsin antibody and gp120 for binding to a
      griffithsin, or upon the ability of the anti-griffithsin antibody
      to bind to a free griffithsin as opposed to a griffithsin bound to
      gp120. Such an anti-griffithsin antibody can be administered to an
      animal to inhibit a viral infection in accordance with methods
      provided herein. Although nonhuman anti-idiotypic antibodies, such
      as an anti-griffithsin antibody that has an internal image of
      gp120 and, therefore, is anti-idiotypic to gp120, are proving
      useful as vaccine antigens in humans, their favorable properties
      might, in certain instances, be further enhanced and/or their
      adverse properties further diminished, through "humanization"
      strategies, such as those recently reviewed by Vaughan (Nature
      Biotech., 16: 535-539 (1998)). Alternatively, a griffithsin can be
      directly administered to an animal to inhibit a viral infection in
      accordance with methods provided herein such that the treated
      animal, itself, generates an anti-griffithsin antibody that has an
      internal image of gp120. The production of anti-idiotypic
      antibodies, such as anti-griffithsin antibody that has an internal
      image of gp120 and, therefore, is anti-idiotypic to gp120, in an
      animal to be treated is known as "anti-idiotype induction
      therapy," and is described by Madiyalakan et al. (Hybridoma, 14:
      199-203 (1995)), for example.<br>
      <br>
      [0132] In view of the above, the invention enables another method
      of inhibiting infection of an animal, such as a mammal, in
      particular a human, with a virus. The method comprises
      administering to the animal an anti-griffithsin antibody, or a
      composition comprising same, in an amount sufficient to induce in
      the animal an immune response to the virus, whereupon the
      infection of the animal with the virus is inhibited. Preferably,
      the anti-griffithsin antibody has an internal image of a viral
      glycoprotein, such as gp120 of an immunodeficiency virus with
      which the animal can be infected, such as a primate
      immunodeficiency virus. Preferably, the antibody can compete with,
      for example, gp120 of a primate immunodeficiency virus for binding
      to a griffithsin. In this regard, the primate immunodeficiency
      virus preferably is HIV-1 or HIV-2 and the griffithsin preferably
      consists essentially of SEQ ID NO: 3 or SEQ ID NO: 2. The method
      can further comprise the administration of an immunostimulant.<br>
      <br>
      [0133] Also enabled by the invention is yet another method of
      inhibiting infection of an animal, such as a mammal, in particular
      a human, with a virus. The method comprises administering to the
      animal a griffithsin, which binds a viral glycoprotein, such as
      gp120 of an immunodeficiency virus with which the animal can be
      infected, in an amount sufficient to induce in the animal an
      anti-griffithsin antibody in an amount sufficient to induce an
      immune response to a virus sufficient to inhibit infection of the
      animal with the virus. Preferably, the anti-griffithsin antibody
      has an internal image of gp120 of an immunodeficiency virus with
      which the animal can be infected, such as a primate
      immunodeficiency virus. Preferably, the antibody can compete with
      gp120 of a primate immunodeficiency virus for binding to a
      griffithsin. In this regard, the primate immunodeficiency virus
      preferably is HIV-1 or HIV-2 and the griffithsin preferably
      consists essentially of SEQ ID NO: 2 or SEQ ID NO: 3.<br>
      <br>
      [0134] With respect to the above methods, sufficient amounts can
      be determined in accordance with methods known in the art.
      Similarly, the sufficiency of an immune response in the inhibition
      of a viral infection in an animal also can be assessed in
      accordance with methods known in the art.<br>
      <br>
      [0135] Either one of the above methods can further comprise
      concurrent, pre- or post-treatment with an adjuvant to enhance the
      immune response, such as the prior, simultaneous or subsequent
      administration, by the same or a different route, of an antiviral
      agent or another agent that is efficacious in inducing an immune
      response to the virus, such as an immunostimulant. See, for
      example, Harlow et al. (1988), supra.<br>
      <br>
      [0136] The inventive griffithsins, conjugates, host cells,
      antibodies, compositions and methods are further described in the
      context of the following examples. These examples serve to
      illustrate further the present invention and are not intended to
      limit the scope of the invention.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLES</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Example 1</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0137] This example illustrates a method of isolating and
      purifying griffithsin from Griffithsin sp. and elucidating the
      griffithsin amino acid sequence.<br>
      <br>
      [0138] Anti-HIV bioassay guided fractionation was used to track
      the isolation of the griffithsin polypeptide. In brief, the
      cellular mass from Griffithsia sp. was harvested by filtration,
      freeze-dried, and extracted first with H2O followed by (1:1)
      MeOH-CH2Cl2. Individual aliquots of the organic and aqueous
      extracts were tested for cytoprotective properties in the NCI
      primary anti-HIV screen (Weislow et al. J. Natl. Cancer Inst., 81:
      577-586 (1989)). Only the H2O extract showed anti-HIV activity.<br>
      <br>
      [0139] A freeze-dried aqueous extract (10 g) was brought to a
      concentration of 50 mg/ml by addition of DDH2O and maintained on
      ice. Crystalline ammonium sulfate (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.;
      molecular biology grade) was added to the solution such that the
      final concentration of the mixture was 75% saturation. The mixture
      was allowed to precipitate on ice over night, and was then
      centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 50 min. The resulting pellets were set
      aside. The supernatant was brought to 1 M ammonium sulfate
      followed by another round of precipitation and centrifugation. The
      pellets from the second centrifugation were saved, and the
      resulting supernatant was filtered using a 0.22 [mu]m filter and
      subjected to hydrophobic interaction chromatography. A BioCad
      workstation (Perseptive Biosystems) was used for the following
      column chromatographies. The protein solution from the
      centrifugation and filtration steps was injected onto a Poros PE
      column (10*100 mm, Perseptive Biosystems) pre-equilibrated with a
      starting buffer of 50 mM sodium phosphate, 1.5 M ammonium sulfate,
      pH 7.5. The column was eluted at a flow rate of 15 ml/min over the
      following gradient: (1) 7 column volumes (CV, equal to 7.85 ml) of
      the starting buffer; (2) 1.5-0 M ammonium sulfate over 2 CV; (3) 0
      M ammonium sulfate for 15 CV. The eluate was monitored for both
      conductivity and absorbance (280 nm). Ammonium sulfate was added
      to the void fraction possessing anti-HIV activity to bring the
      final concentration to 75% saturation. The mixture was allowed to
      precipitate on ice overnight, and was then centrifuged at 3000 rpm
      for 50 min. DDH2O-resuspended pellets were first concentrated
      using a 10 kDa molecular weight limit membrane, dialyzed against
      0.02% sodium azide, and then brought up to a concentration of 25
      mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.5. The resulting protein solution was injected
      onto a Poros HQ anion exchange column (10*100 mm, Perseptive
      Biosystems) pre-equilibrated with a starting buffer of 25 mM
      Tris-HCl, pH 8.5. The column was eluted at a flow rate of 15
      ml/min using the following gradient: (1) 5 CV of the starting
      buffer; (2) 0-1 M sodium chloride over 20 CV; (3) 1 M sodium
      chloride for 5 CV. The eluate was monitored for absorbance (280
      nm). Active fractions from the HQ column were concentrated and
      desalted using a 10 kDa molecular weight limit membrane and
      subjected to a Bio-RP C4 reverse phase column (4.6*100 mm,
      Covance, Princeton, N.J.) and eluted at a flow rate of 4 ml/min
      using the following gradient: (1) 10 CV of the starting buffer of
      5% acetonitrile in H2O; (2) 5-95% acetonitrile in H2O over 2.5 CV;
      (3) 95% acetonitrile in H2O for 5 CV. The eluate was monitored for
      absorbance (280 nm), and the active fraction was pooled,
      lyophilized, and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS),
      pH 7.4. The protein solution was injected onto a G3000PW gel
      permeation column (21.5*600 mm, TosoHaas, Montgomeryville, Pa.)
      and eluted with PBS, pH 7.4, at a flow rate of 5 ml/min.<br>
      <br>
      [0140] Molecular mass and purity (&gt;99%) of griffithsin were
      confirmed by Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS),
      and the protein concentrations were determined by amino acid
      analysis. Native molecular weight was determined by calibrating
      standard proteins (albumin (68 kDa), cytochrome c (12.5 kDa), and
      aprotinin (6.5 kDa)) by their retention time (as measured by
      absorbance at 280 nm) and comparing the resulting calibration
      curve to the retention time of the active protein. Amino acid
      analysis was accomplished using a Beckman Model 6300 Automated
      Amino Acid Analyzer according to manufacturer protocols.
      N-terminal amino acid sequencing was performed using an Applied
      Biosystems Model 4774A Sequencer according to manufacturer
      protocols. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of
      flight mass spectroscopy (MALDI-TOF MS) was performed using a
      Kratos Kompact Maldi III instrument (Shimadzu, Columbia, Md.)
      operated in a linear mode using sinapinic acid as a matrix and
      trypsin as an external standard. ESI-MS was performed with a JEOL
      SX102 equipped with an Analytica electrospray source. The
      spectrometer was calibrated using a lysozyme standard (molecular
      weight=14305.2) prior to each analysis. Samples were injected into
      the source in a 1:1 solution of hexafluorosopropanol and 2% acetic
      acid. The masses reported were averages calculated from the
      various charged states observed.<br>
      <br>
      [0141] Griffithsin was subjected to digestion with cyanogen
      bromide (CNBr) and a variety of endoproteinases (Lys-C, Arg-C, and
      Asp-N) per manufacturer's instructions. The cleaved peptide
      products were purified by reversed-phase HPLC using a gradient of
      0.05% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid for 20 min, then increasing to
      60% acetonitrile in 0.05% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid over 100
      min. Amino acid sequences were determined by sequential Edman
      degradation using an Applied Biosystems Model 494 sequencer
      according to the protocols of the manufacturer, and the masses of
      cleaved peptides were analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer. The
      amino acid sequence of the native griffithsin polypeptide is set
      forth as SEQ ID NO: 3.<br>
      <br>
      [0142] In summary, the preliminary analysis of the crude aqueous
      extract of algae Griffithsia sp. in the NCI's primary in vitro
      anti-HIV screening assay (Weislow et al., supra) identified a
      protein that bound soluble gp120. The process described herein is
      illustrated in FIG. 1. Anti-HIV bioassay-guided fractionation of
      the aqueous resulted in the isolation of griffithsin. The aqueous
      extract was subjected to ammonium sulfate precipitation,
      hydrophobic interaction chromatography, anion exchange
      chromatography, reversed-phase chromatography, and size exclusion
      chromatography to produce a homogeneous protein fraction. SDS-PAGE
      analysis showed a single protein band with a relative molecular
      mass of approximately 13 kDa, named griffithsin. Purified
      griffithsin exhibited a single band by immunoblotting with
      anti-griffithsin polyclonal antibodies. The amino acid sequence of
      the purified griffithsin was established by N-terminal Edman
      degradation of the intact protein and by N-terminal sequencing of
      peptide fragments cleaved by CNBr and a variety of endopeptidases
      (Lys-C, Arg-C, and Asp-N) followed by reversed phase purification
      and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometric analysis. The entire 121 amino
      acid sequence was established except for a single amino acid at
      position 31, which does not match any of the common amino acids.
      Electrospray ionization mass spectrometric analysis of isolated
      griffithsin showed a molecular ion with m/z 12,770.05, and the
      calculated value for the deduced amino acid sequence without amino
      acid at position 31 was m/z 12619.00. It was deduced that the
      molecular mass of the amino acid at position 31 was 151.05. The
      amino acid analysis of griffithsin also agreed with the deduced
      primary sequence. These data fully support the proposed primary
      amino acid sequence of griffithsin. A search of the BLAST database
      (Altschul et al., Nucleic Acids Res, 25 (17), 3389-3402 (1997))
      for identification of protein sequence similarities did not reveal
      any homologies of greater than eight contiguous amino acids nor
      &gt;30% total sequence homology between griffithsin and any amino
      acid sequences of known proteins or transcription products of
      known nucleotide sequences, including the anti-HIV proteins
      cyanovirin-N and scytovirin.<br>

      <b>Example 2</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0143] This example demonstrates the synthesis of griffithsin
      genes. The methods described herein are illustrated in FIG. 2.<br>
      <br>
      [0144] The chemically deduced amino acid sequence of griffithsin
      was back-translated to elucidate the corresponding DNA coding
      sequence. Since amino acid residue 31 of native griffithsin did
      not appear to be one of the twenty common amino acids, alanine was
      substituted in this position (SEQ ID NO: 2). In order to
      facilitate initial production and purification of recombinant
      griffithsin, a commercial expression vector pET-26b(+), from
      Novagen, Inc., Madison, Wis., for which reagents were available
      for affinity purification and detection, was selected. Appropriate
      restriction sites for ligation to pET-26b(+), and a stop codon,
      were included in the DNA sequence. SEQ ID NO: 1 is an example of a
      DNA sequence encoding a synthetic griffithsin gene. A flowchart
      illustrating a method of synthesizing of a griffithsin gene is
      shown in FIG. 2.<br>
      <br>
      [0145] A griffithsin-encoding DNA sequence was synthesized as 13
      overlapping, complementary oligonucleotides and assembled to form
      the double-stranded coding sequence. Oligonucleotide elements of
      the synthetic DNA coding sequence were synthesized using a nucleic
      acid synthesizer (model 394, Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City,
      Calif.). The purified 13 oligonucleotides were individually
      treated with T4 polynucleotide kinase, and 1 nM quantities of each
      were pooled and boiled for 10 minutes to ensure denaturation. The
      temperature of the mixture was then reduced to 70[deg.] C. for
      annealing of the complementary strands for 15 minutes, and further
      reduced to 60[deg.] C. for 15 minutes. The reaction was cooled on
      ice and T4 DNA ligase (2,000 units) additional ligase buffer was
      added to the reaction. Ligation of the oligonucleotides was
      performed with T4 DNA ligase overnight at 16[deg.] C. The
      resulting DNA was recovered and purified from the reaction buffer
      by phenol:chloroform extraction, ethanol precipitation, and
      further washing with ethanol.<br>
      <br>
      [0146] The purified, double-stranded synthetic DNA was then used
      as a template in a polymerase chain reaction (PCR). One [mu]l of
      the DNA solution obtained after purification of the ligation
      reaction mixture was used as a template. Thermal cycling was
      performed using a Perkin-Elmer instrument. "Pfu" thermostable DNA
      polymerase, restriction enzymes, T4 DNA ligase, and polynucleotide
      kinase were obtained from Stratagene, La Jolla, Calif. Pfu
      polymerase was selected for this application because of its
      claimed superiority in fidelity compared to the usual Taq enzyme.
      The PCR reaction product was run on a 2% agarose gel in TAE
      buffer. The 465 base pair DNA construct was cut from the gel and
      purified. The purified DNA, which was digested with Nde I and Xho
      I restriction enzymes, was then ligated into the multicloning site
      of the pet-26b(+) vector.<br>
      <br>
      [0147] E. coli were transfected with the generated
      pET-26b(+)-construct, and recombinant clones were identified by
      analysis of restriction digests of plasmid DNA. Sequence analysis
      of one of these selected clones indicated that three bases
      deviated from the intended coding sequence. These "mutations,"
      which presumably arose during the PCR amplification of the
      synthetic template, were corrected by a site-directed mutagenesis
      kit from Stratagene, La Jolla, Calif. The repair was confirmed by
      DNA sequence analysis.<br>
      <br>
      [0148] For preparation of a DNA sequence encoding a griffithsin
      polypeptide tagged with a penta-His peptide at the C-terminal end
      of griffithsin (e.g., SEQ ID NO: 4), the aforementioned
      recombinant griffithsin construct was subjected to site-directed
      mutagenesis to eliminate stop codons located between the
      griffithsin coding sequence and the penta-His peptide coding
      sequence using a site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene, La
      Jolla, Calif. A pair of mutagenic oligonucleotide primers were
      synthesized, which included portions of the codons encoding the
      griffithsin polypeptide and penta-His peptide, but lacked the stop
      codons. Annealing of these mutagenic primers with the template DNA
      and extension by DNA polymerase resulted in the generation of a
      DNA construct encoding a fusion protein comprising the griffithsin
      amino acid sequence linked to a penta-His peptide tag. DNA
      sequencing verified the presence of the intended sequence.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 3</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0149] This example demonstrates the expression of an N-terminal
      His-tagged-griffithsin gene.<br>
      <br>
      [0150] A recombinant griffithsin protein and a C-terminal,
      His-tagged griffithsin protein encoded by the nucleic acids of
      Example 2 did not efficiently translocate to the periplasmic
      fraction of E. coli following protein expression. In addition, the
      majority of the produced proteins accumulated in the inclusion
      bodies of E. coli without the cleavage of a pelB signal sequence
      located at the N-terminus of the griffithsin protein. Thus, steps
      were taken to express griffithsin in the cytosolic fraction of E.
      coli.<br>
      <br>
      [0151] The pET-26b(+)-griffithsin DNA construct was used as a
      template PCR using a pair of appropriate primers. The PCR product
      was designed to have a "penta-His" peptide and thrombin
      recognition site at the N-terminal end of the griffithsin
      polypeptide, providing for production of a N-terminal,
      His-tagged-griffithsin fusion protein. The PCR reaction product
      was purified from an agarose gel. The purified DNA, which was
      digested with Nco I and Xho I restriction enzymes, was ligated
      into the expression vector pET-28a(+) vector (Novagen, Inc.,
      Madison, Wis.).<br>
      <br>
      [0152] E. coli (strain BL21 (DE3)) were transfected with the
      pET-28a(+) vector containing the nucleic acid coding sequence for
      the His-tagged-griffithsin fusion protein (see SEQ ID NO: 4).
      Selected clones were seeded into small-scale shake flasks
      containing LB growth medium with 30 [mu]g/ml kanamycin and
      expanded by incubation at 37[deg.] C. Larger-scale Erlenmeyer
      flasks (0.5-3.0 liters) were then seeded. The culture was allowed
      to grow to a density of 0.5-0.7 OD600 units. The expression of the
      His-tagged-griffithsin fusion protein was induced by adding IPTG
      to a final concentration of 1 mM and continuing incubation at
      37[deg.] C. for 3-6 hrs. Bacteria were harvested by
      centrifugation, and the soluble fraction was obtained using
      BugBuster(TM) reagent and Benzonase nuclease (Novagen, Inc.,
      Madison, Wis.). Crude soluble fractions showed both anti-HIV
      activity and presence of a His-tagged-griffithsin fusion protein
      by Western-blotting. In addition, the His-tagged-griffithsin
      protein accumulated in the inclusion bodies of E. coli. A
      flowchart illustrating a method of expressing and purifying
      recombinant His-tagged-griffithsin is shown in FIG. 3.<br>
      <br>
      [0153] The purity (~98%) of recombinant His-tagged griffithsin was
      confirmed by SDS-PAGE on 16% Tricine gel stained by Coomassie Blue
      staining. The protein showed the expected molecular mass for
      griffithsin (i.e., 14.6 kDa). Protein concentrations were
      determined based on extinction coefficient at 280 nm of the
      protein. Approximately 1.6 mg of recombinant His-tagged
      griffithsin was purified from 1 L of E. coli culture. The purified
      protein demonstrated gp120-binding and anti-viral activity
      equivalent to that of native griffithsin.<br>
      <br>
      [0154] This example illustrates a method of producing recombinant
      griffithsin, which displays physical and functional properties
      similar, if not identical, to that of natural griffithsin.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 4</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0155] This example describes a method of purifying a recombinant
      His-tagged-griffithsin protein.<br>
      <br>
      [0156] Using an immobilized metal affinity chromatography set-up
      including Ni-NTA agarose (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, Calif.), a
      His-tagged-griffithsin fusion protein (as described in Example 3)
      was purified.<br>
      <br>
      [0157] The soluble fraction described in Example 3 was loaded onto
      20 ml gravity columns containing affinity matrix. The columns were
      washed extensively with washing buffer (50 mM NaH2PO4, 300 mM
      NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, pH 8.0) to remove contaminating proteins.
      Since His-tagged griffithsin cannot compete for binding sites on
      the Ni-NTA resin if the imidazole concentration is increased to
      100-250 mM, the His-tagged griffithsin protein was eluted by
      applying elution buffer (50 mM NaH2PO4, 300 mM NaCl, 250 mM
      imidazole, pH 8.0) through the column. Column fractions and wash
      volumes were monitored by Western-blot analysis using
      Penta-His(TM) antibody (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, Calif.) or
      anti-griffithsin antibody. Fractions containing the purified
      His-tagged griffithsin protein were pooled, dialyzed extensively
      against distilled water, and lyophilized.<br>
      <br>
      [0158] Potent cytoprotective and anti-replicative activities of
      both natural and His-tagged recombinant griffithsin were observed
      using the HIV-1RF strain of HIB in CEM-SS cells. Both the natural
      and recombinant griffithsin polypeptides demonstrated a
      concentration-dependent inhibition of virus-induced cell killing.
      Griffithsin treatment also resulted in concomitant decreases in
      supernatant reverse transcriptase and viral core antigen, p24.
      Mid-to-high picomolar concentrations of griffithsin exhibited
      comparably potent activity against all of the representative
      T-tropic laboratory strains and primary isolates as well as
      M-tropic primary isolates. In the antiviral assays, there was
      little or no evidence of direct cytotoxicity of griffithsin to the
      uninfected control cells at the highest tested concentrations of
      griffithsin (78.3 to 783 nM). Griffithsin-pretreated uninfected
      CEM-SS cells retained normal susceptibility to HIV infection after
      the removal of griffithsin. In contrast, infectivity of cell-free
      virus was abolished after pretreatment and removal of griffithsin.
      These results indicate that griffithsin is a virucide.
      Cocultivation of uninfected and chronically infected CEM-SS with
      griffithsin resulted in concentration-dependent inhibition of
      cell-cell fusion. Additional binding and fusion inhibition assay
      using [beta]-gal indicator cells showed similar results.
      Griffithsin inhibited fusion of CD4 [beta]-gal cells with HL [2/3]
      cells and also inhibited cell-free HIV-1IIIB fusion and infection
      of [beta]-gal cells in a concentration-dependent manner.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 5</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0159] This example illustrates the anti-HIV activity of natural
      griffithsin polypeptide and His-tagged griffithsin polypeptide.<br>
      <br>
      [0160] Pure proteins were initially evaluated for antiviral
      activity using an XTT-tetrazolium anti-HIV assay described
      previously (Boyd, in Aids, Etiology, Diagnosis, Treatment And
      Prevention (1988), supra; Gustafson et al., J. Med. Chem., 35:
      1978-1986 (1992); Weislow (1989), supra; Gulakowski (1991),
      supra). A CEM-SS human lymphocytic target cell line was used in
      all assays maintained in RPMI 1650 medium (Gibco, Grand Island,
      N.Y.), without phenol red, supplemented with 5% fetal bovine
      serum, 2 mM L-Glutamine, and 50 mg/ml Gentamicin (complete
      medium).<br>
      <br>
      [0161] Exponentially growing cells were pelleted and resuspended
      at a concentration of 2.0*10&lt;5 &gt;cells/ml in complete medium.
      The Haitian variant of HIV, HTLV-IIIRF (3.54*10&lt;6 &gt;SFU/ml),
      was used throughout. Frozen virus stock solutions were thawed
      immediately before use and resuspended in complete medium to yield
      1.2*10&lt;5&gt;SFU/ml. The appropriate amounts of the pure
      proteins for anti-HIV evaluations were dissolved in H2O-DMSO
      (3:1), then diluted in complete medium to the desired initial
      concentration. All serial drug dilutions, reagent additions, and
      plate-to-plate transfers were carried out with an automated Biomek
      1000 Workstation (Beckman Instruments, Palo Alto, Calif.).<br>
      <br>
      [0162] FIG. 4 summarizes the observed antiviral activities of
      native griffithsin from Griffithsia sp. (FIG. 4a) and recombinant
      His-tagged-fusion griffithsin (FIG. 4b). Effects of a range of
      concentrations of native griffithsin and HIS-tagged-griffithsin
      upon CEM-SS cells infected with HIV-1, as determined after 6 days
      in culture is illustrated in FIG. 6. Data points represent the
      percent of the respective uninfected, nondrug-treated control
      values. The two griffithsin polypeptides demonstrated potent
      anti-HIV activity with an EC50 in the low nanomolar range and no
      significant evidence of direct cytotoxicity to the host cells at
      the highest tested concentrations (up to 1 mM).<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 6</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0163] This example demonstrates that HIV viral envelope gp120 is
      the principal target for griffithsin.<br>
      <br>
      [0164] To determine the affinity of griffithsin for a series of
      protein standards, 100 ng each of gp160, gp120, gp41, sCD4, bovine
      IgG, [alpha]-acid glycoprotein, and aprotinin were subjected to
      ELISA as previously described (Bokesch et al., Biochemistry, 42:
      2578-2584 (2003)). Briefly, the protein standards were bound to a
      96-well plate, which was rinsed with PBST (three times) and
      blocked with BSA. Between each step of the protocol, the plate was
      rinsed with PBST (three times). The protein standards were
      incubated with griffithsin (100 ng/well), followed by incubation
      with a 1:500 dilution of an anti-griffithsin rabbit polyclonal
      antibody preparation. Griffithsin bound to the protein standards
      was detected by adding goat-anti-rabbit antibodies conjugated to
      alkaline phosphatase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis,
      Ind.). Upon addition of alkaline phosphatase substrate buffer,
      absorbance was measured at 405 nm for each well.
      Glycosylation-dependent binding of griffithsin to gp120 was
      examined using an ELISA as above, with glycosylated and
      nonglycosylated gp120 (HIV-1SF2 gp120) added to the 96-well plate
      and incubated with serial dilutions of griffithsin.<br>
      <br>
      [0165] Griffithsin was tested for its ability to bind HIV envelope
      glycoproteins. Evidence for direct interaction of griffithsin with
      gp120, gp160, and to a lesser degree, gp41 was obtained from ELISA
      experiments (FIG. 5a). There was little or no detectable
      interaction between griffithsin and cCD4 or other reference
      proteins, including bovine IgG, [alpha]-acid glycoprotein, and
      aprotinin. An additional ELISA experiment showed that binding of
      griffithsin to sgp120 is both concentration-dependent and
      glycosylation-dependent (FIG. 5b).<br>
      <br>
      [0166] To undertake preliminary mapping studies to define
      griffithsin-binding site on the gp120, we evaluated the effect of
      griffithsin on the reactivity of soluble CD4 (sCD4), cyanovirin-N,
      and a panel of monoclonal antibodies (mAb) with soluble gp120
      (sgp120) in an ELISA format assay. These studies demonstrated that
      griffithsin interfered strongly with recognition of sgp120 by the
      mAbs 48d and 2G12. Griffithsin moderately interfered with sCD4 and
      mAb IgG1b12 binding to sgp120. Griffithsin had little or no effect
      on the recognition of sgp120 by mAbs that recognize the C1 region
      (or V3 loop), and the mAb 17b. However, additional studies
      demonstrated that pretreatment of sgp120 with sCD4 and the mAbs
      IgG 1b12, 48d, and 2G12 did not block subsequent binding of
      griffithsin to sgp120. Cyanovirin-N interfered strongly with the
      recognition of sgp120 by griffithsin. On the other hand,
      griffithsin pretreatment of sgp120 did not block subsequent
      binding of cyanovirin-N to sgp120.<br>
      <br>
      [0167] Since griffithsin inhibited viral entry, we compared
      matched control and griffithsin-treated sgp120 preparations in a
      flow cytometric sgp120/CD4-expressing cell binding assay to
      determine whether griffithsin inhibits viral attachment or
      subsequent fusion events. The CEM-SS cell line expresses CD4, as
      demonstrated by the binding of target cells with both anti-Leu3a
      and anti-OKT4 monoclonal antibodies. After incubation of CEM-SS
      cells with sgp120, the cells were stained by anti-gp120 mAb-FITC.
      A concomitant decrease in the availability of the Leu3a epitope
      (i.e., the gp120-binding site on target cells) was observed. In
      other words, the sgp120 bound to the gp120 binding site on the
      target cells. As expected, little change in the staining specific
      for the OKT4 epitope (i.e., a non-gp120 binding site) was
      observed. These results are consistent with sgp120 binding of CD4
      on the target cells. Pretreatment of sgp120 with griffithsin
      substantially recovered the availability of the Leu3a epitope,
      indicating that griffithsin completely blocked CD4-dependent
      sgp120 binding. However, overall sgp120 binding showed two peaks
      in the flow cytometry data when griffithsin-treated sgp120 was
      added to the cells. The decreased signal suggests inhibition of
      sgp120 binding to CD4 by griffithsin, which was consistent with
      the recovery of the availability of the Leu3a epitope. The
      increased signal suggests that the griffithsin/sgp120 complex also
      non-specifically bound to target cells.<br>
      <br>
      [0168] This example demonstrates that griffithsin binds to a
      region of gp120 that recognizes CD4 on host cells.<br>

      [0169] This example illustrates the broad-range anti-HIV activity
      of griffithsin.<br>
      <br>
      [0170] Anti-viral assays used to study the activities of
      laboratory strains and primary isolates of virus have been
      previously published (Buckheit et al., Antiviral Res., 21: 247-265
      (1993)). The low passage HIV-1 pediatric isolate ROJO was derived
      as previously described (Buckheit et al., AIDS Res. Hum.
      Retroviruses, 10: 1497-1506 (1994)). Peripheral blood mononuclear
      cells (PBMC) and macrophages were isolated from hepatitis and HIV
      sero-negative donors following Ficoll-Hypaque centrifugation as
      described elsewhere (Gartner and Popovic, Techniques in HIV
      Research, Aldovini, A. and Walker, B., eds., Stockton Press, New
      York (1994) pp. 59-63). Mean EC50 values were determined from
      concentration-response curves from eight dilutions of griffithsin
      (triplicate wells/concentration); assays for HIV-1 RF/CEM-SS
      employed XTT-tetrazolium; HIV-1 ROJO were tested in human PBMC
      cultures by supernatant reverse transcriptase activity; HIV-1 Ba-L
      and ADA were tested in human primary macrophage cultures by p24
      ELISA assay. Standard errors averaged less than 10% of the
      respective means. The results of this study are summarized in
      Table 1 below.<br>

      [0171] The results show that griffithsin is potently active
      (sub-nanomolar EC50 values) against a broad range of HIV isolates
      including T-tropic viruses (utilizing CCR5 as a co-receptor) and
      M-tropic viruses (utilizing CXCR4 as a co-receptor). This
      picomolar level of activity is more potent than that described for
      most of the current anti-HIV agents utilized in therapy or in
      development, including the entry inhibitors cyanovirin-N and
      Enfurtide(R). The data also show that griffithsin is effective at
      inhibiting infection by both laboratory-adapted strains and, more
      importantly, primary clinical isolates of HIV (e.g., ROJO, ADA,
      and Ba-L). Finally, the results indicate that griffithsin is
      active regardless of the cell type used in the assay, having
      potent activity whether the cells were T-lymphocytes (CEM-SS),
      PBMCs, or macrophages. Griffithsin did not show any toxicity
      against any of the cell lines even at concentrations 1000-fold
      higher than the EC50 values.<br>

      <b>Example 8</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0172] This example describes the production of anti-griffithsin
      polyclonal antibodies. A flow diagram illustrating a method of
      producing anti-griffithsin antibodies is provided in FIG. 6.<br>
      <br>
      [0173] A New Zealand white rabbit was immunized with 100 [mu]g of
      griffithsin in Freund's complete adjuvant. Booster injections of
      50 [mu]g of griffithsin in Freund's incomplete adjuvant were
      administered on days 13, 29, 51, 64, 100, and 195. On days 7, 21,
      42, 63, 78, and 112, 10 mL of blood was removed from the rabbit.
      On day 112 the rabbit was sacrificed and bled out. The IgG
      fraction of the immune sera of the rabbit was isolated by
      protein-A Sepharose affinity chromatography (Bio-Rad, Hercules,
      Calif.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reactivity
      of the polyclonal antibodies for griffithsin was demonstrated by
      immunoblot and ELISA studies with 1:500 to 1:3000 dilution of the
      rabbit immunoglobulin fractions.<br>
      <br>
      [0174] For immunoblotting, samples were transferred to PVDF
      membranes following SDS-PAGE according to standard procedures. The
      membranes were incubated for 1 hour with anti-griffithsin
      polyclonal antibodies, washed three times with PBS containing
      0.05% Tween 20 (PBST), and then treated with goat anti-rabbit IgG
      antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Sigma, St. Louis,
      Mo.). After three washes with PBST, bound antibodies were
      visualized by incubating membranes in a solution of 0.05%
      3,3'-diaminobenzidine and 0.003% H2O2.<br>
      <br>
      [0175] The IgG fraction of rabbit polyclonal anti-griffithsin
      antibodies were purified after the final boost and animal
      sacrifice by using protein-A Sepharose chromatography on the 57 mL
      of rabbit serum collected. Following purification, 78 mL of
      purified anti-griffithsin IgGs were produced. The final
      concentration of protein was 335 micrograms/mL for a total yield
      of 27.3 mg of anti-griffithsin IgG. To analyze the specificity of
      the resulting antibody preparation, Western blot analysis was
      performed and resulted in the clear determination of specificity
      and avidity for griffithsin by the purified antibodies. A 1:250
      dilution of the purified antibodies clearly visualized only the
      griffithsin from a mixture of griffithsin and other proteins. The
      response to griffithsin by the anti-griffithsin antibodies was
      also shown to be concentration-dependent.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 9</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0176] This example illustrates the anti-influenza virus activity
      of griffithsin.<br>
      <br>
      [0177] All examined influenza viruses were passaged in Madin Darby
      canine kidney (MDCK) cells to prepare viral stocks. MDCK cells
      (from ATCC, Manassas, Va.) were grown in antibiotic-free minimum
      essential medium (MEM) with non-essential amino acids (Gibco, Long
      Island, N.Y.) containing 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS, HyClone
      Laboratories, Logan, Utah) and 0.1% NaHCO3. Test medium consisted
      of MEM with 0.18% NaHCO3, 10 units/mL trypsin, 1 [mu]g of
      ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA) per ml, and 50 [mu]g
      gentamicin/mL.<br>
      <br>
      [0178] Inhibition of virus-induced cytopathic effect (CPE) as
      determined by visual (microscopic) examination of infected cells
      and confirmed by increase in neutral red (NR) dye uptake into
      infected cells was used as an indicator of griffithsin antiviral
      activity. The CPE inhibition method was reported previously by
      Smee et al. (Antiviral Res., 5: 251-259 (2001)). Seven
      concentrations of griffithsin were screened for antiviral activity
      against each virus in 96-well flat-bottomed microplates of cells.
      The griffithsin protein was added 5-10 minutes prior to addition
      of virus to the cells. The concentration of virus correspond to
      approximately 50% infection of cells in culture (CCID50) per well.
      The virus challenge dose equals a multiplicity of infection of
      approximately 0.001 infectious particles per cell. The reaction
      proceeded at 37[deg.] C. for 72 hr. To perform the NR uptake assay
      for confirmation of antiviral activity, dye (0.34% concentration
      in medium) was added to the plates used to obtain visual scores of
      CPE. After 2 hours, color intensity of the dye absorbed by and
      subsequently eluted from the cells was determined by the method of
      Finter et al., J. Gen. Virol., 5, 419-427 (1969) using a
      computerized EL-309 microplate autoreader (Bio-Tek Instruments,
      Winooski, Vt.). Antiviral activity was expressed as the 50%
      effective (virus-inhibitory) concentration (EC50 value) determined
      by plotting griffithsin concentration versus percent inhibition on
      semi-logarithmic graph paper. Cytotoxicity of compounds was
      assessed in parallel with the antiviral determinations in the same
      microplates, except in the absence of virus. From these, 50%
      cytotoxic endpoints (IC50 values) were determined. The results of
      this study are summarized in Table 2.<br>

      [0179] Similar to the results with HIV, griffithsin was found to
      be potently active against a wide spectrum of influenza A viruses.
      These viruses included both H1N1 strains and H3N2 strains of
      influenza, which is especially significant in light of the fact
      that the highly virulent Fijian strain of influenza A that
      afflicted the United States in 2003/2004 was also a H3N2 strain.
      Griffithsin was not found to be toxic to the MDCK cell line
      utilized for these experiments, even when the cells were exposed
      to a high dose of griffithsin (10 micrograms/mL).<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 10</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0180] This example describes a method of producing recombinant
      griffithsin.<br>
      <br>
      [0181] Recombinant expression of His-tagged griffithsin in E. coli
      was optimized using a fermenter in combination with an
      auto-induction media. A seed culture was grown in LB media
      containing 30 [mu]g/ml kanamycin in a shaker flask at 37[deg.] C.
      and 150 rpm for 17 hours. In addition, a fermenter containing an
      auto-induction media was inoculated with the seed culture. The
      ratio of auto-induction media to seed culture was approximately
      50:1. The culture was grown at 37[deg.] C. for 24 hours. The final
      culture density was approximately 8.6 OD600 units. The final
      culture was harvested by centrifugation, and the soluble fraction
      was obtained as described above.<br>
      <br>
      [0182] Crude soluble fractions contained His-tagged-griffithsin
      fusion protein, which was detected by Western-blotting with
      anti-griffithsin polyclonal antibodies. The ratio of
      soluble:insoluble protein at approximately 15 kDa was 50:50. The
      ratio indicates that more griffithsin protein was produced in
      soluble fraction in this fermentation procedure compared with
      protein expression achieved using a shaker flask procedure. In
      addition, the fermentation procedure provided approximately
      30-fold higher quantities of griffithsin protein than the shaker
      flask procedure. Approximately 50 mg of purified recombinant
      griffithsin was isolated from 1 L of the fermentation. The
      purified protein existed as a homodimer and demonstrated gp120
      binding and anti-viral activity equivalent to that of native
      griffithsin.<br>
      <br>
      [0183] The results of this example confirm a method of producing
      recombinant, anti-viral griffithsin protein.<br>

          <b>TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          The invention relates to an anti-viral Griffithsin polypeptide
          related conjugates, compositions, nucleic acids, vectors, host
          cells, antibodies, and methods for their production and use.<br>
          <br>
          <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          Although the field of viral therapeutics has advanced in
          response to the need for treatments and prophylactics
          effective against diverse classes of viruses, the threat of
          viruses remain among several human populations across the
          world.<br>
          <br>
          Retroviruses, such as HIV, continue to pose a threat to
          humans. There are many ways in which an agent can exhibit
          anti-retroviral activity (e.g., see DeClercq, Adv. Virus Res.,
          42: 1-55 (1993); DeClercq, J. Acquir. Immun. Def. Synd., 4:
          207-218 (1991); and Mitsuya et al., Science, 249: 1533-1544
          (1990). Nucleoside derivatives, such as AZT, which inhibit the
          viral reverse transcriptase, were among the first clinically
          active agents available commercially for anti-HIV therapy.
          Although very useful in some patients, the utility of AZT and
          related compounds is limited by toxicity and insufficient
          therapeutic indices for fully adequate therapy. Also, given
          the subsequent revelations about the true dynamics of HIV
          infection (Coffin, Science, 267: 483-489 (1995); and Cohen,
          Science, 267: 179 (1995)), it has become increasingly apparent
          that agents acting as early as possible in the viral
          replicative cycle are needed to inhibit infection of newly
          produced, uninfected immune cells generated in the body in
          response to the virus-induced killing of infected cells. Also,
          it is essential to neutralize or inhibit new infectious virus
          produced by infected cells.<br>
          <br>
          Effective means for preventing HIV infection also are needed
          as a global priority. Heterosexual transmission accounts for
          the majority of new cases of HIV infection each year. Current
          reports from the World Health Organization estimate that a
          total of more than 40 million people are now infected with
          HIV. HIV prevention research has to date focused predominantly
          on vaccine development. However, no effective preventative or
          therapeutic vaccine has been identified thus far. New
          approaches to vaccine development, as well as entirely
          different strategies and agents for preventing
          person-to-person transmission of HIV infection, are needed.
          One approach showing great promise is the development and use
          of topical microbicides. In this approach, a suitable
          antiviral agent is applied directly at the potential site of
          virus exposure, e.g., the genital mucosa in the case of HIV. A
          suitable antiviral agent is one which inactivates or inhibits
          infectivity of a virus upon contact of the antiviral agent
          with the virus. Suitable animal models are available for
          demonstrating in vivo efficacy of such approaches for
          preventing transmission of immunodeficiency viruses, such as
          HIV. For instance, the HIV-inactivating protein, cyanovirin-N,
          has been shown to inhibit the sexual transmission of a
          chimeric simian/human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) infection
          in a primate model employing macaques exposed to the virus
          vaginally or rectally (C-C Tsai et al., AIDS Res. Hum.
          Retroviruses, 19, 535-541 (2003) and C-C Tsai et al., AIDS
          Res. Hum. Retroviruses, 20, 11-18 (2004)).<br>
          <br>
          Infection of people by influenza viruses is also a major cause
          of pandemic illness, morbidity and mortality worldwide. The
          adverse economic consequences, as well as human suffering, are
          enormous. Available treatments for established infection by
          this virus are either minimally effective or ineffective;
          these treatments employ amantatadine, rimantadine and
          neuraminidase inhibitors. Of these drugs, only the
          neuraminidase inhibitors are substantially active against
          multiple strains of influenza virus that commonly infect
          humans, yet these drugs still have limited utility or efficacy
          against pandemic disease.<br>
          <br>
          Currently, the only effective preventative treatment against
          influenza viral infection is vaccination. However, this, like
          the drug treatments, is severely limited by the propensity of
          influenza viruses to mutate rapidly by genetic exchange,
          resulting in the emergence of highly resistant viral strains
          that rapidly infect and spread throughout susceptible
          populations. In fact, a vaccination strategy is only effective
          from year-to-year if the potential pandemic strains can be
          identified or predicted, and corresponding vaccines prepared
          and administered early enough that the year's potential
          pandemic can be aborted or attenuated. Thus, new preventative
          and therapeutic interventions and agents are urgently needed
          to combat influenza viruses.<br>
          <br>
          New agents with broad anti-influenza virus activity against
          diverse strains, clinical isolates and subtypes of influenza
          virus would be highly useful, since such agents would most
          likely remain active against the mutating virus. The two major
          types of influenza virus that infect humans are influenza A
          and B, both of which cause severe acute illness that may
          include both respiratory and gastrointestinal distress, as
          well as other serious pathological sequellae. An agent that
          has anti-influenza virus activity against diverse strains and
          isolates of both influenza A and B, including recent clinical
          isolates thereof, would be particularly advantageous for use
          in prevention or treatment of hosts susceptible to influenza
          virus infection.<br>
          <br>
          The predominant mode of transmission of influenza viral
          infection is respiratory, i.e., transmission via inhalation of
          virus-laden aerosolized particles generated through coughing,
          sneezing, breathing, etc., of an influenza-infected
          individual. Transmission of infectious influenza virions may
          also occur through contact (e.g., through inadvertent
          hand-to-mouth contact, kissing, touching, etc.) with saliva or
          other bodily secretions of an infected individual. Thus, the
          primary first points of contact of infectious influenza
          virions within a susceptible individual are the mucosal
          surfaces within the oropharyngeal mucosa, and the mucosal
          surfaces within the upper and lower respiratory tracts. Not
          only do these sites comprise first points of virus contact for
          initial infection of an individual, they are also the primary
          sites for production and exit (e.g., by coughing, sneezing,
          salivary transmission, etc.) of bodily fluids containing
          infectious influenza viral particles. Therefore, availability
          of a highly potent anti-influenza virus agent, having
          broad-spectrum activity against diverse strains and isolates
          of influenza viruses A and B, which could be applied or
          delivered topically to the aforementioned mucosal sites of
          contact and infection and transmission of infectious influenza
          viruses, would be highly advantageous for therapeutic and
          preventative inhibition of influenza viral infection, either
          in susceptible uninfected or infected hosts.<br>
          <br>
          Highly pathogenic avian H5N1 influenza A viruses have been of
          widespread concern in recent years. The H5N1 virus can be
          highly lethal to birds and humans raising concerns of a
          possible pandemic (Hatta and Kawaoka, Uirusu. 55(1):55-61
          (2005)). The well-established pathogenicity of these avian
          influenza viruses makes evident the need in the art for the
          development of effective anti-H5N1 drugs and vaccines.<br>
          <br>
          Infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) also represents an
          important public health problem. HCV is a leading cause of
          chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma
          (Verslype et al., Acta Gastroenterol Belg. 68(3):314-318
          (2005)). Patients with HCV are mainly treated today with
          interferon, alone or in combination with ribavirin. However,
          such treatments eliminate the virus from only about one half
          of the patients (Watashi and Shimotohno, Uirusu. 55(1):105-110
          (2005)). Therefore, a more effective approach to the treatment
          of HCV infection is needed.<br>
          <br>
          In the latter part of 2002, a new disease, severe acute
          respiratory syndrome (SARS), emerged in China, and an animal
          coronavirus that had crossed the species barrier through close
          contact of humans with infected animals was later identified
          as the etiological agent. The coronavirus rapidly adapted to
          the new host and not only became readily transmissible between
          humans but also more pathogenic. Air travel spread the virus
          rapidly around the world and ultimately the virus infected
          8096 people and caused 774 deaths in 26 countries on 5
          continents. Aggressive quarantine measures successfully
          terminated SARS (Stadler and Rappuoli, Curr Mol Med.
          5(7):677-697 (2005)). However, a resurgence of SARS is still a
          threat, because the causative agent remaining in animal
          reservoirs is not fully understood, and sporadic cases
          continue to be reported (Lu et al., Acta Pharmacol Sin.
          26(12):1479-1484 (2005)). Therefore, there is a need in the
          art to develop antiviral drugs and vaccines specific for the
          SARS virus.<br>
          <br>
          The Zaire ebola virus has caused large outbreaks of severe and
          usually fatal hemorrhagic disease in humans for which there is
          no effective treatment or cure (Towner et al., Virology
          332(1):20-27 (2005)). Thus, there is a need in the art for
          effective methods of treating or preventing ebola viral
          infections in humans.<br>
          <br>
          In this regard, new classes of anti-viral agents, to be used
          alone or in combination existing anti-viral agents, are needed
          for effective anti-viral therapy. New agents are also
          important for the prophylactic inhibition of viral infection.
          In both areas of need, the ideal new agent(s) would act as
          early as possible in the viral life cycle; be as
          virus-specific as possible (i.e., attack a molecular target
          specific to the virus but not the host); render the intact
          virus noninfectious; prevent the death or dysfunction of
          virus-infected cells; prevent further production of virus from
          infected cells; prevent spread of virus infection to
          uninfected cells; be highly potent and active against the
          broadest possible range of strains and isolates of a given
          virus; be resistant to degradation under physiological and
          rigorous environmental conditions; and be readily and
          inexpensively produced.<br>
          In view of the foregoing, there is a need in the art for new
          methods and compositions for inhibiting viral infection. The
          invention provides such methods. These and other advantages of
          the invention, as well as additional inventive features, will
          become apparent from the description provided herein.<br>
          <br>
          <b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          The invention provides, among other things, an isolated and

          The invention further provides a method of inhibiting
          prophylactically or therapeutically a viral infection of a

          </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESENT INVENTION</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          The principal overall objective of the invention is to provide
          an anti-viral polypeptide and derivatives thereof, and broad
          uses thereof (e.g., medical and research uses), including
          prophylactic and/or therapeutic applications against viruses.
          An initial observation, which led to the invention, was
          anti-viral activity of certain extracts from a marine
          organism, namely Rhodophyte (Griffithsia sp.), originally
          collected in the territorial waters of New Zealand. Low
          picomolar concentrations of a protein isolated from the
          extracts, referred to herein as Griffithsin, irreversibly
          inactivated human clinical isolates of HIV. Its HIV molecular
          target is high mannose-comprised oligosaccharide constituents
          of Env glycoproteins. Upon binding, Griffithsin inhibits viral
          binding, fusion, and entry. Griffithsin also targets other
          viruses, such as other retroviruses, e.g., EV, SIV and HTLV,
          and non-retroviruses, such as measles and, especially,
          influenza (e.g., H5N1 virus), Ebola, Hepatitis C, and SARS
          virus.<br>
          <br>
          Accordingly, the invention provides an isolated and purified
          anti-viral polypeptide of SEQ ID NO: 3 from Griffithsia sp.
          and functional homologs thereof, referred to collectively as
          "Griffithsin." Herein the term "Griffithsin" is used
          generically to refer to a natural Griffithsin or any related,
          functionally equivalent (i.e., anti-viral) polypeptide or
          derivative thereof. By definition, in this context, a related,
          functionally equivalent polypeptide or derivative thereof (a)
          contains a sequence of at least eight contiguous amino acids
          directly identical to a sub-sequence of eight contiguous amino
          acids contained within a natural Griffithsin, and (b) can
          specifically bind to a virus, in particular an influenza virus
          (e.g., H5N1), Hepatitis C, or SARS, Ebola, a retrovirus, more
          specifically a primate immunodeficiency virus, more
          specifically HIV-1, HIV-2 or SIV, or to an infected host cell
          expressing one or more viral antigen(s), more specifically an
          envelope glycoprotein, such as gp120, of the respective virus.
          In addition, such a functionally equivalent polypeptide or
          derivative thereof can comprise the amino acid sequence of a
          natural Griffithsin (see SEQ ID NO: 3), in which 1-20,
          preferably 1-10, more preferably 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, and most
          preferably 1 or 2, amino acids have been removed from one or
          both ends, preferably from only one end, e.g., removed from
          the amino-terminal end, of natural Griffithsin. Alternatively,
          a functionally equivalent polypeptide or derivative thereof
          can comprise the amino acid sequence of a native Griffithsin
          (see SEQ ID NO: 3), in which 1-20, preferably 1-10, more
          preferably 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, and most preferably 1 or 2, amino
          acids have been added to one or both ends, preferably from
          only one end, e.g., the amino-terminal end, of the native
          Griffithsin.<br>
          <br>
          The invention further provides an isolated and purified
          polypeptide encoded by a nucleic acid molecule comprising a
          sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 or a nucleic acid molecule encoding
          an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2 or SEQ ID NO: 3. Upon
          examination of the antiviral Griffithsin polypeptide, the
          amino acid at position 31 of SEQ ID NO: 3 (represented as Xaa)
          was found not to be a familiar amino acid residue. Placement
          of an alanine at position 31, such as achieved in the
          recombinant Griffithsin polypeptide described herein (SEQ ID
          NO: 2), results in a polypeptide exhibiting equivalent
          activity as the natural Griffithsin polypeptide. If desired,
          the amino acid at position 31 can be substituted with any
          other amino acid to facilitate protein production. Ideally,
          the substitution at position 31 of SEQ ID NO: 3 does not
          diminish the anti-viral activity of the protein (e.g., does
          not diminish the anti-viral activity more than 50%, more than
          30% or more than 10%) as compared to the anti-viral activity
          of the native protein. Preferably, the aforementioned nucleic
          acid molecules encode at least eight (e.g., at least 10, at
          least 20, at least 30, at least 50, at least 70, at least 80,
          at least 90, or at least 100) contiguous amino acids of the
          amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 3, which desirably have
          anti-viral activity. If the at least eight contiguous amino
          acids of SEQ ID NO: 3 comprise amino acids 1-121, desirably
          amino acid residue 45, 60, 71, and/or 104 has been rendered
          glycosylation resistant, while maintaining antiviral activity
          of the polypeptide.<br>
          <br>
          The term "isolated" as used herein means having been removed
          from its natural environment. The term "purified" as used
          herein means having been increased in purity, wherein "purity"
          is a relative term and not to be construed as absolute purity.
          By "antiviral" is meant that the polypeptide or fragment
          thereof can inhibit a virus (e.g., inhibit entry of a virus
          into a host cell, limit the spread of viral infection by
          inhibiting cell to cell fusion, and the like), in particular
          an influenza virus, such as influenza virus of a strain A or
          strain B, or an H5N1 influenza virus, a retrovirus,
          specifically a primate immunodeficiency virus (e.g., an HIV
          virus such as HIV-1, HIV-2 or SW), a SARS coronavirus, Ebola,
          or a Hepatitis C virus.<br>
          <br>
          Preferably, the polypeptide or derivative thereof comprises an
          amino acid sequence that is substantially homologous to that
          of an anti-viral protein from Griffithsia sp. By
          "substantially homologous" is meant sufficient homology to
          render the polypeptide or derivative thereof anti-viral, with
          anti-viral activity characteristic of an anti-viral protein
          isolated from Griffithsia sp. At least about 50% homology
          (e.g., at least about 60% homology, at least about 65%
          homology, or at least about 70% homology), preferably at least
          about 75% homology (e.g., at least about 80% homology or at
          least about 85% homology), and most preferably at least about
          90% homology (e.g., at least about 95% homology) should exist.<br>
          <br>
          Alterations of the natural amino acid sequence to produce
          variant polypeptides can be done by a variety of means known
          to those skilled in the art. For instance, amino acid
          substitutions can be conveniently introduced into the
          polypeptides at the time of synthesis. Alternatively,
          site-specific mutations can be introduced by ligating into an
          expression vector a synthesized oligonucleotide comprising the
          modified site. Alternately, oligonucleotide-directed,
          site-specific mutagenesis procedures can be used, such as
          disclosed in Walder et al., Gene, 42: 133 (1986); Bauer et
          al., Gene, 37: 73 (1985); Craik, Biotechniques, 12-19 (January
          1995); and U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,518,584 and 4,737,462.<br>
          <br>
          It is within the skill of the ordinary artisan to select
          synthetic and naturally-occurring amino acids that effect
          conservative or neutral substitutions for any particular
          naturally-occurring amino acids. The ordinarily skilled
          artisan desirably will consider the context in which any
          particular amino acid substitution is made, in addition to
          considering the hydrophobicity or polarity of the side-chain,
          the general size of the side chain and the pK value of
          side-chains with acidic or basic character under physiological
          conditions. For example, lysine, arginine, and histidine are
          often suitably substituted for each other, and more often
          arginine and histidine. As is known in the art, this is
          because all three amino acids have basic side chains, whereas
          the pK value for the side-chains of lysine and arginine are
          much closer to each other (about 10 and 12) than to histidine
          (about 6). Similarly, glycine, alanine, valine, leucine, and
          isoleucine are often suitably substituted for each other, with
          the proviso that glycine is frequently not suitably
          substituted for the other members of the group. This is
          because each of these amino acids are relatively hydrophobic
          when incorporated into a polypeptide, but glycine's lack of an
          [alpha]-carbon allows the phi and psi angles of rotation
          (around the [alpha]-carbon) so much conformational freedom
          that glycinyl residues can trigger changes in conformation or
          secondary structure that do not often occur when the other
          amino acids are substituted for each other. Other groups of
          amino acids frequently suitably substituted for each other
          include, but are not limited to, the group consisting of
          glutamic and aspartic acids; the group consisting of
          phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan; and the group
          consisting of serine, threonine and, optionally, tyrosine.
          Additionally, the ordinarily skilled artisan can readily group
          synthetic amino acids with naturally-occurring amino acids.<br>
          <br>
          The ordinarily skilled artisan can generate Griffithsin
          mutants or variants by, for example, substituting or mutating
          amino acids which are not critical for the anti-viral function
          of the polypeptide. Ideally, mutations that do not modify the
          electronic or structural environment of the peptide are
          generated to retain optimal antiviral activity. For example,
          natural Griffithsin forms dimers, which can be advantageous in
          some embodiments. Therefore, alterations which do not disrupt
          dimer formation can be preferred. Amino acid residues which
          are not responsible for folding or stability of the
          three-dimensional conformation of the Griffithsin polypeptide
          are candidate residues for mutation. Alternatively or in
          addition, amino acids which are not involved in glycoprotein
          binding can be mutated or replaced. It is understood that
          surface hydrophobicity plays a key role in protein-protein
          interactions and surface electrophilicity is important to
          protein-sugar interactions, such as the interaction between
          Griffithsin and viral proteins. Hydrophobic surface clusters
          and electrophilic surface clusters on the Griffithsin peptide
          or homologs which suggest regions critical for interaction
          with the viral envelope can be mapped using routine methods
          such as those disclosed in Bewley et al., Nature Structural
          Biology, 5(7): 571-578 (1998). Amino acid residues not found
          either in electrophilic or hydrophobic surface clusters are
          likely not critical for hydrophobicity or electrophilicity of
          these clusters and, thus, are appropriate targets for mutation
          to create Griffithsin fragments (e.g., anti-viral polypeptides
          comprising at least about eight contiguous amino acids of SEQ
          ID NO: 2 or SEQ ID NO: 3), variants, mutants, or homologs
          (e.g., Griffithsin variants having 80%, 85%, or 90% homology
          to SEQ ID NO: 2 or SEQ ID NO: 3) which retain antiviral
          activity. If desired, amino acid residues which are
          responsible for binding to high-mannose
          oligosaccharide-containing glycoproteins on the viral surface
          can be mutated to increase the specificity or affinity of
          glycoprotein binding.<br>
          <br>
          If desired, the proteins and peptides of the invention
          (including antiviral fragments, variant polypeptides, fusion
          proteins, and conjugates) can be modified, for instance, by
          glycosylation, amidation, carboxylation, or phosphorylation,
          or by the creation of acid addition salts, amides, esters, in
          particular C-terminal esters, and N-acyl derivatives of the
          proteins of the invention. The polypeptides also can be
          modified to create protein derivatives by forming covalent or
          noncovalent complexes with other moieties in accordance with
          methods known in the art. Covalently-bound complexes can be
          prepared by linking the chemical moieties to functional groups
          on the side chains of amino acids comprising the proteins, or
          at the N- or C-terminus. Desirably, such modifications and
          conjugations do not adversely affect the activity of the
          polypeptides (and variants thereof). While such modifications
          and conjugations can have greater or lesser activity, the
          activity desirably is not negated and is characteristic of the
          unaltered polypeptide.<br>
          <br>
          The polypeptides (and fragments, homologs, variants, and
          fusion proteins) can be prepared by any of a number of
          conventional techniques. The polypeptide can be isolated or
          purified from a naturally occurring source or from a
          recombinant source. For instance, in the case of recombinant
          proteins, a DNA fragment encoding a desired polypeptide can be
          subcloned into an appropriate vector using well-known
          molecular genetic techniques (see, e.g., Maniatis et al.,
          Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd ed. (Cold Spring
          Harbor Laboratory (1989)) and other references cited herein
          under "EXAMPLES"). The fragment can be transcribed and the
          polypeptide subsequently translated in vitro. Commercially
          available kits also can be employed (e.g., such as
          manufactured by Clontech, Palo Alto, Calif.; Amersham Life
          Sciences, Inc., Arlington Heights, Ill.; InVitrogen, San
          Diego, Calif.; and the like). The polymerase chain reaction
          optionally can be employed in the manipulation of nucleic
          acids.<br>
          <br>
          Such polypeptides also can be synthesized using an automated
          peptide synthesizer in accordance with methods known in the
          art. Alternately, the polypeptide (and fragments, homologs,
          variants, and fusion proteins) can be synthesized using
          standard peptide synthesizing techniques well-known to those
          of skill in the art (e.g., as summarized in Bodanszky,
          Principles of Peptide Synthesis, (Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg:
          1984)). In particular, the polypeptide can be synthesized
          using the procedure of solid-phase synthesis (see, e.g.,
          Merrifield, J. Am. Chem. Soc., 85: 2149-54 (1963); Barany et
          al., Int. J. Peptide Protein Res., 30: 705-739 (1987); and
          U.S. Pat. No. 5,424,398). If desired, this can be done using
          an automated peptide synthesizer. Removal of the
          t-butyloxycarbonyl (t-BOC) or 9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl
          (Fmoc) amino acid blocking groups and separation of the
          polypeptide from the resin can be accomplished by, for
          example, acid treatment at reduced temperature. The
          protein-containing mixture then can be extracted, for
          instance, with diethyl ether, to remove non-peptidic organic
          compounds, and the synthesized polypeptide can be extracted
          from the resin powder (e.g., with about 25% w/v acetic acid).
          Following the synthesis of the polypeptide, further
          purification (e.g., using HPLC) optionally can be preformed in
          order to eliminate any incomplete proteins, polypeptides,
          peptides or free amino acids. Amino acid and/or HPLC analysis
          can be performed on the synthesized polypeptide to validate
          its identity. For other applications according to the
          invention, it may be preferable to produce the polypeptide as
          part of a larger fusion protein, either by chemical
          conjugation or through genetic means, such as are known to
          those skilled in the art. In this regard, the invention also
          provides a fusion protein comprising the isolated or purified
          antiviral polypeptide (or fragment thereof) or variant thereof
          and one or more other protein(s) having any desired properties
          or effector functions, such as cytotoxic or immunological
          properties, or other desired properties, such as to facilitate
          isolation, purification, analysis, or stability of the fusion
          protein.<br>
          <br>
          A Griffithsin conjugate comprising a Griffithsin coupled to at
          least one effector component, which can be the same or
          different, is also provided. The effector component can be
          polyethylene glycol, dextran, albumin, an immunological
          reagent, a toxin, an antiviral agent, or a solid support
          matrix. "Immunological reagent" will be used to refer to an
          antibody, an antibody fragment (e.g., an F(ab')2, an Fab', an
          Fab, an Fv, an sFv, a dsFv, or an Fc antibody fragment), an
          immunoglobulin, and an immunological recognition element. An
          immunological recognition element is an element, such as a
          peptide, e.g., the FLAG sequence of a recombinant
          Griffithsin-FLAG fusion protein, which facilitates, through
          immunological recognition, isolation and/or purification
          and/or analysis of the protein or peptide to which it is
          attached. An immunological reagent also can be an immunogenic
          peptide, which can be fused to Griffithsin for enhancing an
          immune response. In this respect, the invention provides an
          anti-viral conjugate comprising a Griffithsin polypeptide or
          fragment thereof bound to a virus or viral envelope
          glycoprotein. A Griffithsin fusion protein is a type of
          Griffithsin conjugate, wherein a Griffithsin is coupled to one
          or more other protein(s) having any desired properties or
          effector functions, such as cytotoxic or immunological
          properties, or other desired properties, such as to facilitate
          isolation, purification or analysis of the fusion protein or
          increase the stability or in vivo half-life of the fusion
          protein. Griffithsin also can be attached to a chemical moiety
          which allows recognition, isolation, purification, and/or
          analysis of the protein or peptide. An example of such a
          chemical moiety is a His tag of a recombinant Griffithsin-His
          fusion protein.<br>
          A "toxin" can be, for example, Pseudomonas exotoxin. An
          "antiviral agent" can be AZT, ddI, ddC, 3TC gancyclovir,
          fluorinated dideoxynucleosides, nevirapine, R82913, Ro
          31-8959, BI-RJ-70, acyclovir, [alpha]-interferon, recombinant
          sCD4, michellamines, calanolides, nonoxynol-9, gossypol and
          derivatives thereof, gramicidin, amantatadine, rimantadine,
          and neuraminidase inhibitors, and cyanovirin-N or a functional
          homolog or derivative thereof (see, for example, U.S. Pat. No.
          5,843,882). A "solid support matrix" can be a magnetic bead, a
          flow-through matrix, a sponge, a stent, a culture plate, or a
          matrix comprising a contraceptive device, such as a condom,
          diaphragm, cervical cap, vaginal ring or contraceptive sponge.
          In an alternative embodiment, a solid support matrix can be an
          implant for surgical implantation in a host and, if
          appropriate, later removal.<br>
          In view of the foregoing, the invention further provides a
          composition comprising (i) the isolated or purified antiviral
          polypeptide (or fragment thereof), a variant thereof, a fusion
          protein of the antiviral polypeptide (or fragment thereof) or
          variant thereof, and a conjugate of the antiviral polypeptide
          (or fragment thereof) or variant thereof, and/or (ii) a
          carrier, excipient or adjuvant therefor. Preferably, component
          (i) of the composition is present in an antiviral effective
          amount and the carrier is pharmaceutically acceptable. By
          "antiviral effective amount" is meant an amount sufficient to
          inhibit the infectivity of the virus.<br>
          <br>
          The carrier can be any of those conventionally used and is
          limited only by chemico-physical considerations, such as
          solubility and lack of reactivity with the active agent of the
          invention, and by the route of administration. It is preferred
          that the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier be one which is
          chemically inert to the active agent and one which has no
          detrimental side effects or toxicity under the conditions of
          use. The pharmaceutically acceptable carriers described
          herein, for example, vehicles, adjuvants, excipients, and
          diluents, are well-known to those ordinarily skilled in the
          art and are readily available to the public. Typically, the
          composition, such as a pharmaceutical composition, can
          comprise a physiological saline solution; dextrose or other
          saccharide solution; or ethylene, propylene, polyethylene, or
          other glycol. The pharmaceutical composition preferably does
          not comprise mannose or N-acetyl-glucosamine, as these
          molecules may interfere with the functioning of the antiviral
          agent.<br>
          <br>
          The invention also provides a method of obtaining a
          Griffithsin from Griffithsia sp. Such a method comprises (a)
          identifying an extract of Griffithsia sp. containing
          anti-viral activity, (b) optionally removing high molecular
          weight biopolymers from the extract, (c) anti-viral
          bioassay-guided fractionating the extract to obtain a crude
          extract of Griffithsin, and (d) purifying the crude extract by
          reverse-phase HPLC to obtain Griffithsin (see, also, Example
          1). More specifically, the method involves the use of ethanol
          to remove high molecular weight biopolymers from the extract
          and the use of an anti-HIV bioassay to guide fractionation of
          the extract.<br>
          <br>
          Griffithsin (a polypeptide of exactly SEQ ID NO: 3), which was
          isolated and purified using the aforementioned method, was
          subjected to conventional procedures typically used to
          determine the amino acid sequence of a given pure protein.
          Thus, the Griffithsin was initially sequenced by N-terminal
          Edman degradation of intact protein and numerous overlapping
          peptide fragments generated by endoproteinase digestion. Amino
          acid analysis was in agreement with the deduced sequence. ESI
          mass spectrometry of reduced, HPLC-purified Griffithsin showed
          a molecular ion consistent with the calculated value. These
          studies indicated that Griffithsin from Griffithsia was
          comprised of a unique sequence of 121 amino acids having
          little or no significant homology or identity to previously
          described proteins or transcription products of known
          nucleotide sequences. No more than eight contiguous amino
          acids from Griffithsin were found in any amino acid sequences
          from known proteins, nor were there any known proteins from
          any source having significant sequence identity with
          Griffithsin. Given the chemically deduced amino acid sequence
          of Griffithsin, a corresponding recombinant Griffithsin
          (r-Griffithsin) was created and used to establish definitively
          that the deduced amino acid sequence was, indeed, active
          against virus, such as HIV and influenza.<br>
          <br>
          Accordingly, the invention provides isolated and purified
          nucleic acid molecules and synthetic nucleic acid molecules,
          which comprise a coding sequence for a Griffithsin, such as an
          isolated and purified nucleic acid molecule comprising a
          sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, an isolated and purified nucleic
          acid molecule encoding an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2,
          an isolated and purified nucleic acid sequence encoding an
          amino acid sequence SEQ ID NO: 3, an isolated and purified
          nucleic acid molecule comprising a sequence of SEQ ID NO: 4,
          an isolated and purified nucleic acid sequence encoding an
          amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 5, and a nucleic acid
          molecule that is substantially homologous or substantially
          identical to any one of the aforementioned nucleic acid
          molecules. By "substantially homologous" is meant sufficient
          homology to render the polypeptide or derivative thereof
          anti-viral, with anti-viral activity characteristic of an
          anti-viral protein isolated from Griffithsia. At least about
          50% homology or identity (e.g., at least about 60%, at least
          about 65%, or at least about 70% homology or identity),
          preferably at least about 75% homology or identity (e.g., at
          least about 80% or at least about 85% homology or identity),
          and most preferably at least about 90% homology or identity
          (e.g., at least about 95% homology or identity) should exist.<br>
          <br>
          The inventive nucleic acid molecule preferably comprises a
          nucleic acid sequence encoding at least eight (preferably at
          least 10, more preferably at least 20, and most preferably at
          least 30) contiguous amino acids of the amino acid sequence of
          SEQ ID NO: 3 or SEQ ID NO: 2. The inventive nucleic acid
          molecule also comprises a nucleic acid sequence encoding a
          polypeptide comprising the amino acid sequence of a native
          Griffithsin, in which 1-20, preferably 1-10, more preferably
          1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, and most preferably 1 or 2, amino acids have
          been removed from one or both ends, preferably from only one
          end, e.g., removed from the amino-terminal end, of the native
          Griffithsin. Alternatively, the nucleic acid molecule can
          comprise a nucleic acid sequence encoding a polypeptide
          comprising the amino acid sequence of a natural Griffithsin
          (see SEQ ID NO: 3), in which 1-20, preferably 1-10, more
          preferably 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, and most preferably 1 or 2, amino
          acids have been added to one or both ends, preferably from
          only one end, e.g., the amino-terminal end, of the native
          Griffithsin. Preferably, the isolated and purified nucleic
          acid molecule encodes a polypeptide comprising at least eight
          contiguous amino acids of SEQ ID NO: 3, which desirably have
          anti-viral activity. If the at least eight contiguous amino
          acids comprise amino acids 1-121 of SEQ ID NO: 3, desirably
          amino acids 46, 60, 71, and/or 104 have been rendered
          glycosylation resistant, while maintaining antiviral activity
          of the polypeptide. Deletions and substitutions of SEQ ID NO:
          2 or SEQ ID NO: 3 are within the skill in the art.<br>
          <br>
          Given the present disclosure, it will be apparent to one
          skilled in the art that a partial Griffithsin gene sequence
          will likely suffice to code for a fully functional, i.e.,
          anti-viral, such as anti-influenza or anti-HIV, Griffithsin. A
          minimum essential DNA coding sequence(s) for a functional
          Griffithsin can readily be determined by one skilled in the
          art, for example, by synthesis and evaluation of sub-sequences
          comprising the native Griffithsin, and by site-directed
          mutagenesis studies of the Griffithsin DNA coding sequence.<br>
          <br>
          Using an appropriate DNA coding sequence, a recombinant
          Griffithsin can be made by genetic engineering techniques (for
          general background see, e.g., Nicholl, in An Introduction to
          Genetic Engineering, Cambridge University Press: Cambridge
          (1994), pp. 1-5 &amp; 127-130; Steinberg et al., in
          Recombinant DNA Technology Concepts and Biomedical
          Applications, Prentice Hall: Englewood Cliffs, N.J. (1993),
          pp. 81-124 &amp; 150-162; Sofer in Introduction to Genetic
          Engineering, Butterworth-Heinemann, Stoneham, Mass. (1991),
          pp. 1-21 &amp; 103-126; Old et al., in Principles of Gene
          Manipulation, Blackwell Scientific Publishers: London (1992),
          pp. 1-13 &amp; 108-221; and Emtage, in Delivery Systems for
          Peptide Drugs, Davis et al., eds., Plenum Press: New York
          (1986), pp. 23-33). For example, a Griffithsia gene or cDNA
          encoding a Griffithsin can be identified and subcloned. The
          gene or cDNA then can be incorporated into an appropriate
          expression vector and delivered into an appropriate
          polypeptide-synthesizing organism (e.g., E. coli, S.
          cerevisiae, P. pastoris, or other bacterial, yeast, insect,
          plant or mammalian cells), where the gene, under the control
          of an endogenous or exogenous promoter, can be appropriately
          transcribed and translated. Alternatively, the expression
          vector can be administered to a plant or animal, for example,
          for large-scale production (see, e.g., Fischer et al.,
          Transgenic Res., 9(4-5): 279-299 (2000); Fischer et al., J.
          Biol. Regul. Homeost. Agents, 14: 83-92 (2000); deWilde et

          Methods in Biotechnology, Recombinant Proteins from Plants,
          Production and Isolation of Clinically Useful Compounds,
          Cunningham and Porter, eds., Humana Press: Totowa, N.J.
          (1998)). Such expression vectors (including, but not limited
          to, phage, cosmid, viral, and plasmid vectors) are known to
          those skilled in the art, as are reagents and techniques
          appropriate for gene transfer (e.g., transfection,
          electroporation, transduction, micro-injection,
          transformation, etc.). If a Griffithsin is to be recombinantly
          produced in isolated eukaryotic cells or in a eukaryotic
          organism, such as a plant (see above references and also
          Methods in Biotechnology, Recombinant Proteins from Plants,
          Production and Isolation of Clinically Useful Compounds,
          Cunningham and Porter, eds., Humana Press: Totowa, N.J.
          (1998)), desirably the N-linked glycosylation sites at
          positions 45, 60, 71, and/or 104 is rendered
          glycosylation-resistant, such as in accordance with the
          methods described herein. Subsequently, the recombinantly
          produced polypeptide can be isolated and purified using
          standard techniques known in the art (e.g., chromatography,
          centrifugation, differential solubility, isoelectric focusing,
          etc.), and assayed for anti-viral activity.<br>
          Alternatively, a natural Griffithsin can be obtained from
          Griffithsia by non-recombinant methods, and sequenced by
          conventional techniques. The sequence can then be used to
          synthesize the corresponding DNA, which can be subcloned into
          an appropriate expression vector and delivered into a
          polypeptide-producing cell for en mass recombinant production
          of the desired polypeptide.<br>
          <br>
          In this regard, the invention also provides a vector
          comprising a DNA sequence, e.g., a Griffithsia gene sequence
          for Griffithsin, a cDNA encoding a Griffithsin, or a synthetic
          DNA sequence encoding Griffithsin. The vector can be targeted
          to a cell-surface receptor if so desired. A nucleic acid
          molecule as described above can be cloned into any suitable
          vector and can be used to transform or transfect any suitable
          host. The selection of vectors and methods to construct them
          are commonly known to persons of ordinary skill in the art and
          are described in general technical references (see, in
          general, "Recombinant DNA Part D," Methods in Enzymology, Vol.
          153, Wu and Grossman, eds., Academic Press (1987) and the
          references cited herein under "EXAMPLES"). Desirably, the
          vector comprises regulatory sequences, such as transcription
          and translation initiation and termination codons, which are
          specific to the type of host (e.g., bacterium, fungus, plant
          or animal) into which the vector is to be introduced, as
          appropriate and taking into consideration whether the vector
          is DNA or RNA. Preferably, the vector comprises regulatory
          sequences that are specific to the genus of the host. Most
          preferably, the vector comprises regulatory sequences that are
          specific to the species of the host.<br>
          Constructs of vectors, which are circular or linear, can be
          prepared to contain an entire nucleic acid as described above
          or a portion thereof ligated to a replication system
          functional in a prokaryotic or eukaryotic host cell.
          Replication systems can be derived from ColE1, 2 m[mu]
          plasmid, [lambda], SV40, bovine papilloma virus, and the like.<br>
          <br>
          In addition to the replication system and the inserted nucleic
          acid, the construct can include one or more marker genes,
          which allow for selection of transformed or transfected hosts.
          Marker genes include biocide resistance, e.g., resistance to
          antibiotics, heavy metals, etc., complementation in an
          auxotrophic'host to provide prototrophy, and the like.<br>
          <br>
          One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that any of a
          number of vectors known in the art are suitable for use in the
          invention. Suitable vectors include those designed for
          propagation and expansion or for expression or both. Examples
          of suitable vectors include, for instance, plasmids,
          plasmid-liposome complexes, and viral vectors, e.g.,
          parvoviral-based vectors (i.e., adeno-associated virus
          (AAV)-based vectors), retroviral vectors, herpes simplex virus
          (HSV)-based vectors, and adenovirus-based vectors. Any of
          these expression constructs can be prepared using standard

          (Stratagene), [lambda] EMBL4, and [lambda] NM1149, also can be

          pBI101.2, pBI101.3, pBI121 and pBIN19 (Clonetech, Palo Alto,
          Calif.). Examples of animal expression vectors include
          pEUK-C1, pMAM and pMAMneo (Clonetech).<br>
          An expression vector can comprise a native or normative
          promoter operably linked to an isolated or purified nucleic
          acid as described above. The selection of promoters, e.g.,
          strong, weak, inducible, tissue-specific and
          developmental-specific, is within the skill in the art.
          Similarly, the combining of a nucleic acid molecule as
          described above with a promoter is also within the skill in
          the art.<br>
          <br>
          The DNA, whether isolated and purified or synthetic, or cDNA
          encoding a Griffithsin can encode for either the entire
          Griffithsin or a portion thereof. Where the DNA or cDNA does
          not comprise the entire coding sequence of the native
          Griffithsin, the DNA or cDNA can be subcloned as part of a
          gene fusion. In a transcriptional gene fusion, the DNA or cDNA
          will contain its own control sequence directing appropriate
          production of protein (e.g., ribosome binding site,
          translation initiation codon, etc.), and the transcriptional
          control sequences (e.g., promoter elements and/or enhancers)
          will be provided by the vector. In a translational gene
          fusion, transcriptional control sequences as well as at least
          some of the translational control sequences (i.e., the
          translational initiation codon) will be provided by the
          vector. In the case of a translational gene fusion, a chimeric
          protein will be produced.<br>
          <br>
          Genes also can be constructed for specific fusion proteins
          containing a functional Griffithsin component plus a fusion
          component conferring additional desired attribute(s) to the
          composite protein. For example, a fusion sequence for a toxin
          or immunological reagent can be added to facilitate
          purification and analysis of the functional protein.<br>
          <br>
          Genes can be specifically constructed to code for fusion
          proteins, which contain a Griffithsin coupled to an effector
          protein, such as a toxin or immunological reagent, for
          specific targeting to a virus or viral-infected cells, e.g.,
          HIV and/or HIV-infected cells or influenza and/or
          influenza-infected cells. In these instances, the Griffithsin
          moiety serves not only as a neutralizing agent but also as a
          targeting agent to direct the effector activities of these
          molecules selectively against a given virus, such as HIV or
          influenza. Thus, for example, a therapeutic agent can be
          obtained by combining the HIV-targeting function or
          influenza-targeting function of a functional Griffithsin with
          a toxin aimed at neutralizing infectious virus and/or by
          destroying cells producing infectious virus, such as HIV or
          influenza. Similarly, a therapeutic agent can be obtained,
          which combines the viral-targeting function of a Griffithsin
          with the multivalency and effector functions of various
          immunoglobulin subclasses. Example 6 further illustrates the
          viral-targeting, specifically gp120-targeting, properties of a
          Griffithsin.<br>
          <br>
          Similar rationales underlie extensive developmental
          therapeutic efforts exploiting the HIV gp120-targeting
          properties of sCD4. For example, sCD4-toxin conjugates have
          been prepared in which sCD4 is coupled to a Pseudomonas
          exotoxin component (Chaudhary et al., in The Human Retrovirus,
          Gallo et al., eds., Academic Press: San Diego, Calif. (1991),
          pp. 379-387; and Chaudhary et al., Nature, 335: 369-372
          (1988)), or to a diphtheria toxin component (Aullo et al.,
          EMBO J., 11: 575-583 (1992)) or to a ricin A-chain component
          (Till et al., Science, 242: 1166-1167 (1988)). Likewise,
          sCD4-immunoglobulin conjugates have been prepared in attempts
          to decrease the rate of in vivo clearance of functional sCD4
          activity, to enhance placental transfer, and to effect a
          targeted recruitment of immunological mechanisms of pathogen
          elimination, such as phagocytic engulfment and killing by
          antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, to kill and/or
          remove HIV-infected cells and virus (Capon et al., Nature,
          337: 525-531 (1989); Traunecker et al., Nature, 339: 68-70
          (1989); and Langner et al. (1993), supra). While such
          CD4-immunoglobulin conjugates (sometimes called
          "immunoadhesins") have, indeed, shown advantageous
          pharmacokinetic and distributional attributes in vivo, and
          anti-HIV effects in vitro, clinical results have been
          discouraging (Schooley et al. (1990), supra; Husson et al.
          (1992), supra; and Langner et al. (1993), supra). This is not
          surprising since clinical isolates of HIV, as opposed to
          laboratory strains, are highly resistant to binding and
          neutralization by sCD4 (Orloff et al. (1995), supra; and Moore
          et al. (1992), supra). The Griffithsin polypeptide binds to a
          wide range of sugars present on viral glycoproteins and,
          therefore, can inhibit a wide range of viruses which display
          those glycoproteins. The extraordinarily broad targeting
          properties of a functional Griffithsin to viruses, e.g.,
          primate retroviruses, in general, and clinical and laboratory
          strains, in particular, can be especially advantageous for
          combining with toxins, immunoglobulins and other selected
          effector proteins.<br>
          <br>
          Viral-targeted conjugates can be prepared either by genetic
          engineering techniques (see, for example, Chaudhary et al.
          (1988), supra) or by chemical coupling of the targeting
          component with an effector component. The most feasible or
          appropriate technique to be used to construct a given
          Griffithsin conjugate or fusion protein will be selected based
          upon consideration of the characteristics of the particular
          effector molecule selected for coupling to a Griffithsin. For
          example, with a selected non-proteinaceous effector molecule,
          chemical coupling, rather than genetic engineering techniques,
          may be the only feasible option for creating the desired
          Griffithsin conjugate.<br>
          <br>
          Accordingly, the invention also provides nucleic acid
          molecules encoding Griffithsin fusion proteins. In particular,
          the invention provides a nucleic acid molecule comprising SEQ
          ID NO: 4 and substantially homologous sequences thereof. Also
          provided is a vector comprising a nucleic acid sequence
          encoding a Griffithsin fusion protein and a method of
          obtaining a Griffithsin fusion protein by expression of the
          vector encoding a Griffithsin fusion protein in a
          protein-synthesizing organism as described above. Accordingly,
          Griffithsin fusion proteins are also provided.<br>
          <br>
          In view of the above, the invention further provides an
          isolated and purified nucleic acid molecule, which comprises a
          Griffithsin coding sequence, such as one of the aforementioned
          nucleic acids, namely a nucleic acid molecule encoding an
          amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2 or SEQ ID NO: 3 or a
          nucleic acid molecule comprising a sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1
          coupled to a second nucleic acid encoding an effector protein.
          The first nucleic acid preferably comprises a nucleic acid
          sequence encoding at least eight contiguous amino acids of the
          amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2 or SEQ ID NO: 3, which
          encodes a functional Griffithsin, and the second nucleic acid
          preferably encodes an effector protein, such as a toxin or
          immunological reagent as described herein.<br>
          <br>
          Accordingly, the invention also further provides an isolated
          and purified fusion protein encoded by a nucleic acid molecule
          comprising a sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 or a nucleic acid
          molecule encoding an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2 or
          SEQ ID NO: 3, either one of which is coupled to a second
          nucleic acid encoding an effector protein. Preferably, the
          aforementioned nucleic acid molecules encode at least eight
          contiguous amino acids of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID
          NO: 2 or SEQ ID NO: 3, which desirably have anti-viral
          activity, coupled to an effector molecule, such as a toxin or
          immunological reagent as described above. Preferably, the
          effector molecule targets a virus, such as any one or more of
          the viruses identified herein, especially an HIV virus,
          influenza virus (e.g., an H5N1 virus), Severe Acute
          Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) virus, Hepatitis C virus, or Ebola
          virus. When HIV or influenza is targeted, the effector
          molecule preferably targets glycoprotein gp120 of HIV or
          hemaglutinin of influenza. If the at least eight contiguous
          amino acids of SEQ ID NO: 3 (or SEQ ID NO: 2) comprise amino
          acids 1-121, desirably amino acids 46, 60, 71, and/or 104 have
          been rendered glycosylation-resistant, yet maintain antiviral
          activity by substitution of the asparagine at those positions
          with, for example, an alanine or a glutamine residue.<br>
          <br>
          The coupling can be effected at the DNA level or by chemical
          coupling as described above. For example, a
          Griffithsin-effector protein conjugate of the invention can be
          obtained by (a) selecting a desired effector protein or
          peptide; (b) synthesizing a composite DNA coding sequence
          comprising a first DNA coding sequence comprising one of the
          aforementioned nucleic acid sequences, which codes for a
          functional Griffithsin, coupled to a second DNA coding
          sequence for an effector protein or peptide, e.g., a toxin or
          immunological reagent; (c) expressing said composite DNA
          coding sequence in an appropriate protein-synthesizing
          organism; and (d) purifying the desired fusion protein to
          substantially pure form. Alternatively, a Griffithsin-effector
          molecule conjugate of the invention can be obtained by (a)
          selecting a desired effector molecule and a Griffithsin or
          Griffithsin fusion protein; (b) chemically coupling the
          Griffithsin or Griffithsin fusion protein to the effector
          molecule; and (c) purifying the desired Griffithsin-effector
          molecule conjugate to substantially pure form.<br>
          Conjugates comprising a functional Griffithsin (e.g., an
          anti-viral polypeptide comprising at least eight contiguous
          amino acids of SEQ ID NO: 3, as previously described, coupled
          to an anti-Griffithsin antibody, a virus, a viral
          glycoprotein, or at least one effector component, which can be
          the same or different, such as a toxin, an immunological
          reagent, an antiviral agent, or other functional reagent, can
          be designed even more specifically to exploit the unique viral
          targeting properties of Griffithsins.<br>
          <br>
          Other functional reagents that can be used as effector
          components in the inventive conjugates can include, for
          example, polyethylene glycol, dextran, albumin, a solid
          support matrix, and the like, whose intended effector <br>
          functions may include one or more of the following: to improve
          stability of the conjugate; to increase the half-life of the
          conjugate; to increase resistance of the conjugate to
          proteolysis; to decrease the immunogenicity of the conjugate;
          to provide a means to attach or immobilize a functional
          Griffithsin onto a solid support matrix (e.g., see, for
          example, Harris, in Poly(Ethylene Glycol) Chemistry:
          Biotechnical and Biomedical Applications, Harris, ed., Plenum
          Press: New York (1992), pp. 1-14). Conjugates furthermore can
          comprise a functional Griffithsin coupled to more than one
          effector molecule, each of which, optionally, can have
          different effector functions (e.g., such as a toxin molecule
          (or an immunological reagent) and a polyethylene glycol (or
          dextran or albumin) molecule). Diverse applications and uses
          of functional proteins and peptides, such as in the present
          instance a functional Griffithsin, attached to or immobilized
          on a solid support matrix, are exemplified more specifically
          for poly(ethylene glycol) conjugated proteins or peptides in a
          review by Holmberg et al. (In Poly(Ethylene Glycol) Chemistry:
          Biotechnical and Biomedical Applications, Harris, ed., Plenum
          Press: New York (1992), pp. 303-324). Preferred examples of
          solid support matrices include magnetic beads, a flow-through
          matrix, and a matrix comprising a contraceptive device, such
          as a condom, a diaphragm, a cervical cap, a vaginal ring or a
          sponge.<br>
          <br>
          Example 4 reveals novel gp120-directed effects of
          Griffithsins. Solid-phase ELISA experiments show that
          Griffithsin is capable of global conformational effects on
          gp120, as observed as a decrease of immunoreactivity at
          multiple, distinct, non-overlapping epitopes.<br>
          <br>
          The range of anti-viral activity of Griffithsin against
          diverse CD4&lt;+&gt;-tropic immunodeficiency virus strains in
          various target cells is remarkable; virtually all tested
          strains of HIV-1, HIV-2 and SIV were similarly sensitive to
          Griffithsin; clinical isolates and laboratory strains showed
          essentially equivalent sensitivity. Cocultivation of
          chronically infected and uninfected CEM-SS cells with
          Griffithsin did not inhibit viral replication, but did cause a
          concentration-dependent inhibition of cell-to-cell fusion and
          virus transmission; similar results from binding and fusion
          inhibition assays employing HeLa-CD4-LTR-[beta]-galactosidase
          cells were consistent with Griffithsin inhibition of
          virus-cell and/or cell-cell binding.<br>
          <br>
          The anti-viral, e.g., anti-HIV, activity of the Griffithsins
          and conjugates thereof of the invention can be further
          demonstrated in a series of interrelated in vitro anti-viral
          assays (Gulakowski et al., J. Virol. Methods, 33: 87-100
          (1991)), which accurately predict for anti-viral activity in
          humans. These assays measure the ability of compounds to
          prevent the replication of HIV and/or the cytopathic effects
          of HIV on human target cells. These measurements directly
          correlate with the pathogenesis of HIV-induced disease in
          vivo. The results of the analysis of the anti-viral activity
          of Griffithsins or conjugates, as set forth in Examples 5-7
          and 9, predict accurately the anti-viral activity of these
          products in vivo in humans and, therefore, establish the
          utility of the invention. Furthermore, since the invention
          also provides methods of ex vivo use of Griffithsins and
          conjugates, the utility of Griffithsins and conjugates thereof
          is even more certain.<br>
          <br>
          The Griffithsins and conjugates thereof of the invention can
          be used to inhibit a broad range of viruses (see, e.g.,
          Principles of Virology: Molecular Biology, Pathogenesis, and
          Control, Flint et al., eds., ASM Press: Washington, D.C.
          (2000), particularly Chapter 19). Examples of viruses that may
          be treated in accordance with the invention include, but are
          not limited to, Type C and Type D retroviruses, HTLV-1,
          HTLV-2, HIV, FIV, FLV, MLV, BLV, BIV, equine infectious virus,
          anemia virus, avian sarcoma viruses, such as Rous sarcoma
          virus (RSV), hepatitis type A, B, C, non-A and non-B viruses,
          arboviruses, varicella viruses, human herpes virus (e.g.,
          HHV-6), measles, mumps, filovirus (e.g., Ebola, such as Ebola
          strains Sudan, Zaire, Cote d'Ivoire, and Reston), SARS virus,
          and rubella viruses. Griffithsins and conjugates thereof also
          can be used to inhibit influenza viral infection, such as an
          H5N1 viral infection, i.e., a Bird flu viral infection, (see,
          e.g., Fields Virology, third edition, Fields et al., eds.,
          Lippincott-Raven Publishers: Philadelphia, Pa. (1996),
          particularly Chapter 45) prophylactically and therapeutically
          in accordance with the methods set forth herein.<br>
          <br>
          The methods, compounds, and compositions described herein can
          be used to inhibit any of the foregoing viruses, as well as
          other viruses not specifically listed. However, the methods,
          compounds, and compositions described herein are especially
          useful for the inhibition of the H5N1 virus, SARS virus,
          Hepatitis C virus, and Ebola virus as well as retroviruses
          such as HIV.<br>
          <br>
          Thus, the invention further provides a composition comprising
          (i) one or more of an above-described purified or isolated
          nucleic acid or variant thereof, optionally as part of an
          encoded fusion protein, and (ii) a carrier, excipient or
          adjuvant. Preferably, (i) is present in an antiviral effective
          amount and the composition is pharmaceutically acceptable. The
          composition can further comprise at least one additional
          active agent, such as an antiviral agent other than a
          Griffithsin (or antiviral fragment, fusion protein or
          conjugate thereof), in an antiviral effective amount. Suitable
          antiviral agents include AZT, ddA, ddI, ddC, 3TC gancyclovir,
          fluorinated dideoxynucleosides, acyclovir, [alpha]-interferon,
          nonnucleoside analog compounds, such as nevirapine (Shih et
          al., PNAS, 88: 9878-9882, (1991)), TIBO derivatives, such as
          R82913 (White et al., Antiviral Res., 16: 257-266 (1991)),
          Ro31-8959, BI-RJ-70 (Merigan, Am. J. Med., 90 (Suppl. 4A):
          8S-17S (1991)), michellamines (Boyd et al., J. Med. Chem., 37:
          1740-1745 (1994)) and calanolides (Kashman et al., J. Med.
          Chem., 35: 2735-2743 (1992)), nonoxynol-9, gossypol and
          derivatives, gramicidin, Enfurtide (i.e., T20), cyanovirin-N
          and functional homologs thereof (Boyd et al. (1997), supra).
          Other exemplary antiviral compounds include protease
          inhibitors (see R. C. Ogden and C. W. Flexner, eds., Protease
          Inhibitors in AIDS Therapy, Marcel Dekker, NY (2001)), such as
          saquinavir (see I. B. Duncan and S. Redshaw, in R. C. Ogden
          and C. W. Flexner, supra, pp. 27-48), ritonavir (see D. J.

          polyelectrolyte.<br>
          <br>
          The pharmaceutical composition can contain other
          pharmaceuticals, such as virucides, immunomodulators,

          antibiotics include antifungal agents, antibacterial agents,
          and anti-Pneumocystitis carnii agents. Exemplary absorption
          enhancers include bile salts and other surfactants, saponins,
          cyclodextrins, and phospholipids (Davis (1992), supra).<br>

          An isolated cell comprising an above-described purified or
          isolated nucleic acid or variant thereof, optionally in the
          form of a vector, which is optionally targeted to a
          cell-surface receptor, is also provided. Examples of host
          cells include, but are not limited to, a human cell, a human
          cell line, E. coli, B. subtilis, P. aerugenosa, S. cerevisiae,
          and N. crassa. E. coli, in particular E. coli TB-1, TG-2,
          DH5[alpha], XL-Blue MRF' (Stratagene), SA2821 and Y1090.
          Preferably, the cell is a mammalian cell, bacterium, or yeast.
          A preferred bacterium is lactobacillus or other commensal
          microorganism. The above-described nucleic acid or variant
          thereof, optionally in the form of a vector, can be introduced
          into a host cell using such techniques as transfection,
          electroporation, transduction, micro-injection,
          transformation, and the like.<br>
          <br>
          Accordingly, the invention provides a method of inhibiting
          prophylactically or therapeutically a viral infection, in
          particular an influenza viral infection (e.g., an H5N1 viral
          infection), a SARS infection, an Ebola infection, a Hepatitis
          C viral infection, or HIV infection, of a host. The method
          comprises administering to the host an effective amount of an
          anti-viral polypeptide, a variant thereof, an anti-viral
          polypeptide conjugate or an anti-viral fusion protein
          comprising at least eight contiguous amino acids of SEQ ID NO:
          3, wherein the at least eight contiguous amino acids are
          nonglycosylated and have anti-viral activity, whereupon the
          viral infection is inhibited. The anti-viral polypeptide can
          be derived from a Griffithsin obtained from Griffithsia or
          recombinantly produced in accordance with the methods
          described above. Nonglycosylated anti-viral polypeptides can
          be produced in prokaryotic cells/organisms. Amino acids 45,
          60, 71, and/or 104 in such nonglycosylated antiviral
          polypeptides can be deleted or substituted, for example, with
          alanine or glutamine. Nonglycosylated antiviral polypeptides
          also can be produced in eukaryotic cells/organisms by
          expressing a portion of a Griffithsin, such as that of SEQ ID
          NO: 3, that does not contain a glycosylation site or all or a
          portion of a Griffithsin, such as that of SEQ ID NO: 3, which
          contains a glycosylation site that has been rendered
          glycosylation-resistant as described and exemplified herein.
          When the viral infection is an influenza viral infection and
          the anti-viral polypeptide, variant thereof, anti-viral
          polypeptide conjugate, or anti-viral fusion protein is
          administered topically to the host, preferably the anti-viral
          protein or anti-viral peptide is administered to the
          respiratory system of the host, preferably as an inhalant,
          e.g., an inhalant comprising an aerosol or microparticulate
          powder.<br>
          <br>
          The prophylactic and therapeutic treatment of many viral
          infections, including influenza virus infections, is
          complicated by appearance of virus forms resistant to
          currently employed medications, such as neuromimidase
          inhibitors. The inventive method is particularly useful in
          this context, as the inventive anti-viral polypeptide or
          anti-viral polypeptide conjugate binds a wide range of
          glycoproteins present on the viral surface. Accordingly, the
          inventive anti-viral polypeptide, variant, conjugate, or
          fusion protein thereof, can be administered to an animal,
          preferably a human, dog, cat, bird, cow, pig, horse, lamb,
          mouse, or rat, in combination with other anti-viral agents to
          guard against the propagation of anti-viral-resistant strains
          of virus. In addition, it is thought that during adaptive
          mutation (e.g., resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors), the
          level of glycosylation found at the viral surface increases in
          some viruses, such as influenza. Thus, in that the inventive
          anti-viral agent binds sugars of viral surface glycoproteins,
          the inventive method provides a valuable complimentary therapy
          to current anti-viral regimens.<br>
          <br>
          Griffithsins and conjugates thereof collectively comprise
          polypeptides and proteins, and, as such, are particularly
          susceptible to hydrolysis of amide bonds (e.g., catalyzed by
          peptidases) and disruption of essential disulfide bonds or
          formation of inactivating or unwanted disulfide linkages
          (Carone et al., J. Lab. Clin. Med., 100:1-14 (1982)). There
          are various ways to alter molecular structure, if necessary,
          to provide enhanced stability to the Griffithsin, variant,
          fusion protein, or conjugate thereof (Wunsch, Biopolymers, 22:
          493-505 (1983); and Samanen, in Polymeric Materials in
          Medication, Gebelein et al., eds., Plenum Press: New York
          (1985) pp. 227-242), which may be essential for preparation
          and use of pharmaceutical compositions containing
          Griffithsins, or variants, fusion proteins, or conjugates
          thereof, for therapeutic or prophylactic applications against
          viruses, e.g., HIV, influenza, (e.g. H5N1), Hepatitis C,
          Ebola, or SARS. Possible options for useful chemical
          modifications of a Griffithsin, or variant, fusion protein or
          conjugate thereof, include, but are not limited to, the
          following (adapted from Samanen, J. M. (1985) supra): (a)
          olefin substitution, (b) carbonyl reduction, (c) D-amino acid
          substitution, (d) N-methyl substitution, (e) C-methyl
          substitution, (f) C-C'-methylene insertion, (g) dehydro amino
          acid insertion, (h) retro-inverso modification, (i) N-terminal
          to C-terminal cyclization, and (j) thiomethylene modification.
          Griffithsins, variants, fusion proteins, and conjugates
          thereof also can be modified by covalent attachment of
          carbohydrate and polyoxyethylene derivatives, which are
          expected to enhance stability and resistance to proteolysis
          (Abuchowski et al., in Enzymes as Drugs, Holcenberg et al.,
          eds., John Wiley: New York (1981), pp. 367-378).<br>
          <br>
          Other important general considerations for design of delivery
          strategy systems and compositions, and for routes of
          administration, for protein and peptide drugs, such as
          Griffithsins, variants, fusion proteins, and conjugates
          thereof (Eppstein, CRC Crit. Rev. Therapeutic Drug Carrier
          Systems, 5: 99-139 (1988); Siddiqui et al., CRC Crit. Rev.
          Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems, 3: 195-208 (1987); Banga et
          al., Int. J. Pharmaceutics, 48: 15-50 (1988); Sanders, Eur. I
          Drug Metab. Pharmacokinetics, 15: 95-102 (1990); and Verhoef,
          Eur. J. Drug Metab. Pharmacokinetics, 15: 83-93 (1990)), also
          apply. The appropriate delivery system for a given
          Griffithsin, variant, fusion protein, or conjugate thereof
          will depend upon its particular nature, the particular
          clinical application, and the site of drug action. As with any
          protein or peptide drug, oral delivery of a Griffithsin,
          variant, fusion protein, or a conjugate thereof will likely
          present special problems, due primarily to instability in the
          gastrointestinal tract and poor absorption and bioavailability
          of intact, bioactive drug therefrom. Therefore, especially in
          the case of oral delivery, but also possibly in conjunction
          with other routes of delivery, it will be necessary to use an
          absorption-enhancing agent in combination with a given
          Griffithsin, variant, fusion protein, or conjugate thereof. A
          wide variety of absorption-enhancing agents have been
          investigated and/or applied in combination with protein and
          peptide drugs for oral delivery and for delivery by other
          routes (Verhoef (1990), supra; van Hoogdalem, Pharmac. Ther.,
          44: 407-443 (1989); and Davis, J. Pharm. Pharmacol, 44(Suppl.
          1): 186-190 (1992)). Most commonly, typical enhancers fall
          into the general categories of (a) chelators, such as EDTA,
          salicylates, and N-acyl derivatives of collagen, (b)
          surfactants, such as lauryl sulfate and
          polyoxyethylene-9-lauryl ether, (c) bile salts, such as
          glycolate and taurocholate, and derivatives, such as
          taurodihydrofusidate, (d) fatty acids, such as oleic acid and
          capric acid, and their derivatives, such as acylcarnitines,
          monoglycerides and diglycerides, (e) non-surfactants, such as
          unsaturated cyclic ureas, (f) saponins, (g) cyclodextrins, and
          (h) phospholipids.<br>
          <br>
          Other approaches to enhancing oral delivery of protein and
          peptide drugs, such as the Griffithsins, variants, fusion
          proteins, and conjugates thereof, can include aforementioned
          chemical modifications to enhance stability to
          gastrointestinal enzymes and/or increased lipophilicity.
          Alternatively, or in addition, the protein or peptide drug can
          be administered in combination with other drugs or substances,
          which directly inhibit proteases and/or other potential
          sources of enzymatic degradation of proteins and peptides. Yet
          another alternative approach to prevent or delay
          gastrointestinal absorption of protein or peptide drugs, such
          as Griffithsins, variants, fusion proteins, or conjugates
          thereof, is to incorporate them into a delivery system that is
          designed to protect the protein or peptide from contact with
          the proteolytic enzymes in the intestinal lumen and to release
          the intact protein or peptide only upon reaching an area
          favorable for its absorption. A more specific example of this
          strategy is the use of biodegradable microcapsules or
          microspheres, both to protect vulnerable drugs from
          degradation, as well as to effect a prolonged release of
          active drug (Deasy, in Microencapsulation and Related
          Processes, Swarbrick, ed., Marcell Dekker, Inc.: New York
          (1984), pp. 1-60, 88-89, 208-211). Microcapsules also can
          provide a useful way to effect a prolonged delivery of a
          protein and peptide drug, such as a Griffithsin, variant,
          fusion protein, or conjugate thereof, after injection
          (Maulding, J. Controlled Release, 6: 167-176 (1987)).<br>
          <br>
          Given the aforementioned potential complexities of successful
          oral delivery of a protein or peptide drug, it is fortunate
          that there are numerous other potential routes of delivery of
          a protein or peptide drug, such as a Griffithsin, variant,
          fusion protein, or conjugate thereof. These routes include
          topical, subcutaneous, intravenous, intraarterial,
          intrathecal, intracisternal, buccal, rectal, nasal, pulmonary,
          transdermal, vaginal, ocular, and the like (Eppstein (1988),
          supra; Siddiqui et al. (1987), supra; Banga et al. (1988),
          supra; Sanders (1990), supra; Verhoef (1990), supra; Barry, in
          Delivery Systems for Peptide Drugs, Davis et al., eds., Plenum
          Press: New York (1986), pp. 265-275; and Patton et al., Adv.
          Drug Delivery Rev, 8: 179-196 (1992)). With any of these
          routes, or, indeed, with any other route of administration or
          application, a protein or peptide drug, such as a Griffithsin,
          variant, fusion protein, or conjugate thereof, may initiate an
          immunogenic reaction. In such situations it may be necessary
          to modify the molecule in order to mask immunogenic groups. It
          also can be possible to protect against undesired immune
          responses by judicious choice of method of formulation and/or
          administration. For example, site-specific delivery can be
          employed, as well as masking of recognition sites from the
          immune system by use or attachment of a so-called tolerogen,
          such as polyethylene glycol, dextran, albumin, and the like
          (Abuchowski et al. (1981), supra; Abuchowski et al., J. Biol.
          Chem., 252: 3578-3581 (1977); Lisi et al., J. Appl. Biochem,
          4: 19-33 (1982); and Wileman et al., J. Pharm. Pharmacol, 38:
          264-271 (1986)). Such modifications also can have advantageous
          effects on stability and half-life both in vivo and ex vivo.<br>
          <br>
          Procedures for covalent attachment of molecules, such as
          polyethylene glycol, dextran, albumin and the like, to
          proteins, such as Griffithsins, variants, fusion proteins, or
          conjugates thereof, are well-known to those skilled in the
          art, and are extensively documented in the literature (e.g.,
          see Davis et al., in Peptide and Protein Drug Delivery, Lee,
          ed., Marcel Dekker: New York (1991), pp. 831-864).<br>
          Other strategies to avoid untoward immune reactions also can
          include the induction of tolerance by administration initially
          of only low doses. In any event, it will be apparent from the
          present disclosure to one skilled in the art that for any
          particular desired medical application or use of a Griffithsin
          or conjugate thereof, the skilled artisan can select from any
          of a wide variety of possible compositions, routes of
          administration, or sites of application, what is advantageous.<br>
          <br>
          Accordingly, the anti-viral Griffithsins, variants, fusion
          proteins, and conjugates thereof of the invention can be
          formulated into various compositions for use, for example,
          either in therapeutic treatment methods for infected
          individuals, or in prophylactic methods against viral, e.g.,
          HIV and influenza virus, infection of uninfected individuals.<br>
          <br>
          The invention also provides a composition, such as a
          pharmaceutical composition, which comprises an isolated and
          purified Griffithsin, a variant thereof or fusion protein
          comprising the same, a Griffithsin conjugate, a
          matrix-anchored Griffithsin or a matrix-anchored Griffithsin
          conjugate, such as an anti-viral effective amount thereof. The
          composition can further comprise a carrier, such as a
          pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The composition can
          further comprise at least one additional anti-viral compound
          other than a Griffithsin, variant, fusion protein, or
          conjugate thereof, such as in an anti-viral effective amount
          of an anti-viral compound. Suitable anti-viral compounds
          include cyanovirin, AZT, ddI, ddC, gancyclovir, fluorinated
          dideoxynucleosides, nevirapine, R82913, Ro 31-8959, BI-RJ-70,
          acyclovir, [alpha]-interferon, recombinant sCD4,
          michellamines, calanolides, nonoxynol-9, gossypol and
          derivatives thereof, neuroamidase inhibitors, amantatadine,
          rimantadine, enfurtide, and gramicidin. If the composition is
          to be used to induce an immune response, it comprises an
          immune response-inducing amount of a Griffithsin, variant,
          fusion protein, or conjugate thereof and can further comprise
          an immunoadjuvant, such as polyphosphazene polyelectrolyte.
          The Griffithsin used in the composition, e.g., pharmaceutical
          composition, can be isolated and purified from nature or
          genetically engineered. Similarly, the Griffithsin conjugate
          can be genetically engineered or chemically coupled.<br>
          <br>
          The inventive compositions can be administered to a host, such
          as a human, so as to inhibit viral infection in a prophylactic
          or therapeutic method. The compositions of the invention are
          particularly useful in inhibiting the growth or replication of
          a virus, such as influenza virus (e.g., a H5N1 virus), a SARS
          virus, an Ebola virus, a Hepatitis C virus, or a retrovirus,
          in particular an influenza virus or an immunodeficiency virus,
          such as HIV, specifically HIV-1 and HIV-2, inhibiting
          infectivity of the virus, inhibiting the binding of virus to a
          host cell, and the like. The compositions are useful in the
          therapeutic or prophylactic treatment of hosts, e.g., animals,
          such as humans, who are infected with a virus or who are at
          risk for viral infection, respectively. The compositions also
          can be used to treat objects or materials, such as medical
          equipment, supplies, or fluids, including biological fluids,
          such as blood, blood products and vaccine formulations, cells,
          tissues and organs, to remove or inactivate virus in an effort
          to prevent or treat viral infection of a host, e.g., animal,
          such as a human. Such compositions also are useful to prevent
          sexual transmission of viral infections, e.g., HIV, which is
          the primary way in which the world's AIDS cases are contracted
          (Merson (1993), supra). Adherence of the inventive anti-viral
          polypeptide, variant, fusion protein, or conjugate thereof to
          a solid support, such as a filter, can be used in clinics to
          remove all or part of the viral content of a biological
          solution. For example, filters comprising the inventive
          anti-viral agents can be used to treat blood supplies prior to
          transfusion to reduce the risk of viral transmission. Such
          filters would find particular utility in clinics wherein risk
          of viral infection is high. It will be appreciated that total
          removal of the viral content of a biological solution is not
          required to achieve a beneficial effect. Removal of even a
          fraction of virus from a biological solution decreases the
          risk of infection of a patient.<br>
          <br>
          Potential virucides used or being considered for use against
          sexual transmission of HIV are very limited; present agents in
          this category include, for example, nonoxynol-9 (Bird, AIDS,
          5: 791-796 (1991)), gossypol and derivatives (Polsky et al.,
          Contraception, 39: 579-587 (1989); Lin, Antimicrob. Agents
          Chemother, 33: 2149-2151 (1989); and Royer, Pharmacol. Res,
          24: 407-412 (1991)), and gramicidin (Bourinbair, Life
          Sci./Pharmacol. Lett, 54: PL5-9 (1994); and Bourinbair et al.,
          Contraception, 49: 131-137 (1994)). The method of prevention
          of sexual transmission of viral infection, e.g., HIV
          infection, in accordance with the invention comprises vaginal,
          rectal, oral, penile or other topical treatment with an
          anti-viral effective amount of a Griffithsin and/or
          Griffithsin conjugate, alone or in combination with another
          anti-viral compound as described herein.<br>
          <br>
          In a novel approach to anti-HIV prophylaxis pursued under
          auspices of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and
          Infectious Diseases (NIAID) (e.g., as conveyed by Painter, USA
          Today, Feb. 13, 1996), vaginal suppository instillation of
          live cultures of lactobacilli was being evaluated in a
          900-woman study. This study was based especially upon
          observations of anti-HIV effects of certain H2O2-producing
          lactobacilli in vitro (e.g., see published abstract by Hilier,
          from NIAID-sponsored Conference on "Advances in AIDS Vaccine
          Development," Bethesda, Md., Feb. 11-15, 1996). Lactobacilli
          readily populate the vagina, and indeed are a predominant
          bacterial population in most healthy women (Redondo-Lopez et
          al., Rev. Infect. Dis., 12: 856-872 (1990); Reid et al., Clin.
          Microbiol. Rev., 3: 335-344 (1990); Bruce and Reid, Can. J.
          Microbiol., 34: 339-343 (1988); Reu et al., J. Infect. Dis.,
          171: 1237-1243 (1995); Hilier et al., Clin. Infect. Dis.,
          16(Suppl 4): S273-S281; and Agnew et al., Sex. Transm. Dis.,
          22: 269-273 (1995)). Lactobacilli are also prominent,
          nonpathogenic inhabitants of other body cavities such as the
          mouth, nasopharynx, upper and lower gastrointestinal tracts,
          and rectum.<br>
          <br>
          It is well-established that lactobacilli can be readily
          transduced using available genetic engineering techniques to
          incorporate a desired foreign DNA coding sequence, and that
          such lactobacilli can be made to express a corresponding
          desired foreign protein (see, e.g., Hols et al., Appl. and
          Environ. Microbiol., 60: 1401-1413 (1994)). Therefore, within
          the context of the present disclosure, it will be appreciated
          by one skilled in the art that viable host cells containing a
          DNA sequence or vector of the invention, and expressing a
          polypeptide, variant, or fusion protein of the invention, can
          be used directly as the delivery vehicle for a Griffithsin,
          variant, or fusion protein thereof to the desired site(s) in
          vivo. Preferred host cells for such delivery of Griffithsins,
          variants, or fusion proteins thereof directly to desired
          site(s), such as, for example, to a selected body cavity, can
          comprise bacteria or yeast. More specifically, such host cells
          can comprise suitably engineered strain(s) of lactobacilli,
          enterococci, or other common bacteria; such as E. coli, normal
          strains of which are known to commonly populate body cavities.
          More specifically yet, such host cells can comprise one or
          more selected nonpathogenic strains of lactobacilli, such as
          those described by Andreu et al. ((1995), supra), especially
          those having high adherence properties to epithelial cells,
          such as, for example, adherence to vaginal epithelial cells,
          and suitably transformed using the DNA sequences of the
          present invention.<br>

          As reviewed by McGroarty (FEMS Immunol. Med. Microbiol., 6:
          251-264 (1993)) the "probiotic" or direct therapeutic
          application of live bacteria, particularly bacteria that occur
          normally in nature, more particularly lactobacilli, for
          treatment or prophylaxis against pathogenic bacterial or yeast
          infections of the urogenital tract, in particular the female
          urogenital tract, is a well-established concept. Recently, the
          use of a conventional probiotic strategy, in particular the
          use of live lactobacilli, to inhibit sexual transmission of
          HIV has been suggested, based specifically upon the normal,
          endogenous production of virucidal levels of H2O2 and/or
          lactic acid and/or other potentially virucidal substances by
          certain normal strains of lactobacilli (e.g., Hilier (1996),
          supra). However, the inventive use of non-mammalian cells,
          particularly bacteria, more particularly lactobacilli,
          specifically engineered with a foreign gene, more specifically
          a Griffithsin gene, to express an anti-viral substance, more
          specifically a protein, and even more specifically a
          Griffithsin, is heretofore unprecedented as a method of
          treatment of an animal, specifically a human, to prevent
          infection by a virus, specifically a retrovirus, more
          specifically HIV-1 or HIV-2.<br>
          <br>
          Elmer et al. (JAMA, 275: 870-876 (1996)) have recently
          speculated that "genetic engineering offers the possibility of
          using microbes to deliver specific actions or products to the
          colon or other mucosal surfaces . . . other fertile areas for
          future study include defining the mechanisms of action of
          various biotherapeutic agents with the possibility of applying
          genetic engineering to enhance activities." Elmer et al.
          ((1996), supra) further point out that the terms "probiotic"
          and "biotherapeutic agent" have been used in the literature to
          describe microorganisms that have antagonistic activity toward
          pathogens in vivo; those authors more specifically prefer the
          term "biotherapeutic agent" to denote "microorganisms having
          specific therapeutic properties."<br>
          <br>
          In view of the present disclosure, one skilled in the art will
          appreciate that the invention teaches an entirely novel type
          of "probiotic" or "biotherapeutic" treatment using
          specifically engineered strains of microorganisms provided
          herein which do not occur in nature. Nonetheless, available
          teachings concerning selection of optimal microbial strains,
          in particular bacterial strains, for conventional probiotic or
          biotherapeutic applications can be employed in the context of
          the invention. For example, selection of optimal lactobacillus
          strains for genetic engineering, transformation, direct
          expression of Griffithsins or conjugates thereof, and direct
          probiotic or biotherapeutic applications, to treat or prevent
          viral (e.g., HIV) infection, can be based upon the same or
          similar criteria, such as those described by Elmer et al.
          ((1996), supra), typically used to select normal, endogenous
          or "nonengineered" bacterial strains for conventional
          probiotic or biotherapeutic therapy. Furthermore, the
          recommendations and characteristics taught by McGroarty,
          particularly for selection of optimal lactobacillus strains
          for conventional probiotic use against female urogenital
          infections, are pertinent to the present invention: " . . .
          lactobacilli chosen for incorporation into probiotic
          preparations should be easy and, if possible, inexpensive to
          cultivate . . . strains should be stable, retain viability
          following freeze-drying and, of course, be non-pathogenic to
          the host . . . it is essential that lactobacilli chosen for
          use in probiotic preparations should adhere well to the
          vaginal epithelium . . . ideally, artificially implanted
          lactobacilli should adhere to the vaginal epithelium,
          integrate with the indigenous microorganisms present, and
          proliferate" (McGroarty (1993), supra). While McGroarty's
          teachings specifically address selections of "normal"
          lactobacillus strains for probiotic uses against pathogenic
          bacterial or yeast infections of the female urogenital tract,
          similar considerations will apply to the selection of optimal
          bacterial strains for genetic engineering and "probiotic" or
          "biotherapeutic" application against viral infections as
          particularly encompassed by the present invention.<br>
          <br>
          Accordingly, the method of the invention for the prevention of
          sexual transmission of viral infection, e.g., HIV infection,
          comprises vaginal, rectal, oral, penile, or other topical,
          insertional, or instillational treatment with an anti-viral
          effective amount of a Griffithsin, a Griffithsin conjugate or
          fusion protein, a matrix-anchored Griffithsin or conjugate or
          fusion protein thereof, and/or viable host cells transformed
          to express a Griffithsin or conjugate or fusion protein
          thereof, alone or in combination with one or more other
          anti-viral compound (e.g., as described above). However,
          commensal organisms which produce Griffithsin or a fragment,
          homolog, or conjugate thereof can inhibit viruses other than
          HIV. For example, commensal microorganisms that produce the
          inventive polypeptide can be instilled in mucosal tissue at
          the site of influenza contact, such as nasal or oral mucosa,
          to inhibit influenza infection of a host.<br>
          <br>
          Compositions for use in the prophylactic or therapeutic
          treatment methods of the invention comprise one or more
          Griffithsin(s), variant(s), or conjugate(s) or fusion
          protein(s) thereof, either one of which can be
          matrix-anchored, and desirably a carrier therefor, such as a
          pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Pharmaceutically
          acceptable carriers are well-known to those who are skilled in
          the art, as are suitable methods of administration. The choice
          of carrier will be determined in part by the particular
          Griffithsin or conjugate or fusion protein thereof, as well as
          by the particular method used to administer the composition.<br>
          <br>
          One skilled in the art will appreciate that various routes of
          administering a drug are available, and, although more than
          one route can be used to administer a particular drug, a
          particular route can provide a more immediate and more
          effective reaction than another route. For example, the
          anti-viral agent of the invention can be inhaled in methods of
          prophylactically treating a subject for influenza infection
          (e.g., an H5N1 infection). Delivery of the anti-viral agent to
          a location of initial viral contact, such as the nose or
          mouth, blocks the onset of infection. The anti-viral agent can
          be administered via subcutaneous injection. Alternatively, in
          acute or critical medical situations, the anti-viral agent can
          be administered intravenously. In many cases of infection, a
          patient generates an immune response to a virus. However, the
          effects of the viral infection so severely compromise the
          health of the patient that an effective immune response is not
          reached prior to death. Administration of the anti-viral agent
          can prolong the life of the patient until a patient's natural
          immune defense clears the virus. Furthermore, one skilled in
          the art will appreciate that the particular pharmaceutical
          carrier employed will depend, in part, upon the particular
          Griffithsin or conjugate or fusion protein thereof employed,
          and the chosen route of administration. Accordingly, there is
          a wide variety of suitable formulations of the composition of
          the invention.<br>
          <br>
          Formulations suitable for oral administration can consist of
          liquid solutions, such as an effective amount of the compound
          dissolved in diluents, such as water, saline, or fruit juice;
          capsules, sachets or tablets, each containing a predetermined
          amount of the active ingredient, as solid, granules or
          freeze-dried cells; solutions or suspensions in an aqueous
          liquid; and oil-in-water emulsions or water-in-oil emulsions.
          Tablet forms can include one or more of lactose, mannitol,
          corn starch, potato starch, microcrystalline cellulose,
          acacia, gelatin, colloidal silicon dioxide, croscarmellose
          sodium, talc, magnesium stearate, stearic acid, and other
          excipients, colorants, diluents, buffering agents, moistening
          agents, preservatives, flavoring agents, and pharmacologically
          compatible carriers. Suitable formulations for oral delivery
          can also be incorporated into synthetic and natural polymeric
          microspheres, or other means to protect the agents of the
          present invention from degradation within the gastrointestinal
          tract (see, for example, Wallace et al., Science, 260: 912-915
          (1993)).<br>
          <br>
          The anti-viral agent of the invention (e.g., Griffithsin,
          variants, fusion proteins, or conjugates thereof), alone or in
          combination with other anti-viral compounds, can be made into
          aerosol formulations or microparticulate powder formulations
          to be administered via inhalation. These aerosol formulations
          can be placed into pressurized acceptable propellants, such as
          dichlorodifluoromethane, propane, nitrogen, and the like.<br>
          <br>
          The anti-viral agent of the invention (e.g., Griffithsin,
          variants, fusion proteins, or conjugates thereof), alone or in
          combinations with other anti-viral compounds or absorption
          modulators, can be made into suitable formulations for
          transdermal application and absorption, such as a patch
          (Wallace et al. (1993), supra). Transdermal electroporation or
          iontophoresis also can be used to promote and/or control the
          systemic delivery of the compounds and/or compositions of the
          present invention through the skin (e.g., see Theiss et al.,
          Meth. Find. Exp. Clin. Pharmacol., 13: 353-359 (1991)).<br>
          <br>
          Formulations suitable for topical administration include
          lozenges comprising the active ingredient in a flavor, usually
          sucrose and acacia or tragacanth; pastilles comprising the
          active ingredient in an inert base, such as gelatin and
          glycerin, or sucrose and acacia; and mouthwashes comprising
          the active ingredient in a suitable liquid carrier; as well as
          creams, emulsions, gels and the like containing, in addition
          to the active ingredient, such as, for example, freeze-dried
          lactobacilli or live lactobacillus cultures genetically
          engineered to directly produce a Griffithsin, variant,
          conjugate, or fusion protein thereof of the present invention,
          such carriers as are known in the art. Topical administration
          is preferred for the prophylactic and therapeutic treatment of
          influenza viral infection, e.g., H5N1 infection, such as
          through the use of an inhaler, for example.<br>
          <br>
          Formulations for rectal administration can be presented as a
          suppository with a suitable base comprising, for example,
          cocoa butter or a salicylate. Formulations suitable for
          vaginal administration can be presented as pessaries, tampons,
          creams, gels, pastes, foams, or spray formulas containing, in
          addition to the active ingredient, such as, for example,
          freeze-dried lactobacilli or live lactobacillus cultures
          genetically engineered to directly produce a Griffithsin or
          conjugate or fusion protein thereof of the present invention,
          such carriers as are known in the art to be appropriate.
          Similarly, the active ingredient can be combined with a
          lubricant as a coating on a condom. Indeed, preferably, the
          active ingredient is applied to any contraceptive device,
          including, but not limited to, a condom, a diaphragm, a
          cervical cap, a vaginal ring, and a sponge.<br>
          <br>
          Formulations suitable for parenteral administration include
          aqueous and non-aqueous, isotonic sterile injection solutions,
          which can contain anti-oxidants, buffers, bacteriostats, and
          solutes that render the formulation isotonic with the blood of
          the intended recipient, and aqueous and non-aqueous sterile
          suspensions that can include suspending agents, solubilizers,
          thickening agents, stabilizers, and preservatives. The
          formulations can be presented in unit-dose or multi-dose
          sealed containers, such as ampules and vials, and can be
          stored in a freeze-dried (lyophilized) condition requiring
          only the addition of the sterile liquid carrier, for example,
          water, for injections, immediately prior to use.
          Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions can be
          prepared from sterile powders, granules, and tablets of the
          kind previously described.<br>
          <br>
          Formulations comprising a Griffithsin, variant, or fusion
          protein thereof, or Griffithsin conjugate suitable for
          virucidal (e.g., HIV, Hepatitis C, Ebola, SARS and H5N1)
          sterilization of inanimate objects, such as medical supplies
          or equipment, laboratory equipment and supplies, instruments,
          devices, and the like, can, for example, be selected or
          adapted as appropriate, by one skilled in the art, from any of
          the aforementioned compositions or formulations. Preferably,
          the Griffithsin, variant, or fusion protein thereof, is
          produced by recombinant DNA technology. The Griffithsin
          conjugate can be produced by recombinant DNA technology or by
          chemical coupling of a Griffithsin, variant, or fusion protein
          thereof, with an effector molecule as described above.
          Similarly, formulations suitable for ex vivo sterilization,
          inactivation, or removal of virus, such as infectious virus,
          from a sample, such as blood, blood products, sperm, or other
          bodily products, such as a fluid, cells, a tissue or an organ,
          or any other solution, suspension, emulsion, vaccine
          formulation (such as in the removal of infectious virus), or
          any other material which can be administered to a patient in a
          medical procedure, can be selected or adapted as appropriate
          by one skilled in the art, from any of the aforementioned
          compositions or formulations. However, suitable formulations
          for ex vivo sterilization or inactivation or removal of virus
          from a sample or on an inanimate object are by no means
          limited to any of the aforementioned formulations or
          compositions. For example, such formulations or compositions
          can comprise a functional Griffithsin, such as that which is
          encoded by SEQ ID NO: 3, or anti-viral fragment thereof, such
          as a fragment comprising at least eight contiguous amino acids
          of SEQ ID NO: 3, wherein the at least eight contiguous amino
          acids bind to a virus, or a variant, conjugate, or fusion
          protein of either of the foregoing, attached to a solid
          support matrix, to facilitate contacting or binding infectious
          virus in a sample or removing infectious virus from a sample
          as described above, e.g., a bodily product such as a fluid,
          cells, a tissue or an organ from an organism, in particular a
          mammal, such as a human, including, for example, blood, a
          component of blood (e.g., plasma, blood cells, and the like),
          or sperm. Preferably, the anti-viral polypeptide comprises SEQ
          ID NO: 3. Also preferably, the at least eight contiguous amino
          acids bind gp120 of HIV, in particular infectious HIV. As a
          more specific example, such a formulation or composition can
          comprise a functional Griffithsin, variant, conjugate or
          fusion protein thereof, attached to (e.g., coupled to or
          immobilized on) a solid support matrix comprising magnetic
          beads, to facilitate contacting, binding and removal of
          infectious virus, and to enable magnet-assisted removal of the
          virus from a sample as described above, e.g., a bodily product
          such as a fluid, cells, a tissue or an organ, e.g., blood, a
          component of blood, or sperm. Alternatively, and also
          preferably, the solid support matrix comprises a contraceptive
          device, such as a condom, a diaphragm, a cervical cap, a
          vaginal ring, or a sponge. The anti-viral agent also can be
          encapsulated or dispersed within a solid matrix, such as a
          vaginal ring or sponge. Methods for encapsulating
          biotherapeutics into, for example, biocompatible sustained
          release devices, are known in the art.<br>
          <br>
          As an even more specific illustration, such a composition
          (e.g., for ex vivo) can comprise a functional (e.g.,
          gp120-binding, HIV-inactivating) Griffithsin, variant,
          conjugate, or fusion protein thereof, attached to a solid
          support matrix, such as magnetic beads or a flow-through
          matrix, by means of an anti-Griffithsin antibody or at least
          one effector component, which can be the same or different,
          such as polyethylene glycol, albumin, or dextran. The
          conjugate can further comprise at least one effector
          component, which can be the same or different, selected from
          the group consisting of, for example, an immunological reagent
          and a toxin. A flow-through matrix would comprise, for
          instance, a configuration similar to an affinity column. The
          Griffithsin can be covalently coupled to a solid support
          matrix via an anti-Griffithsin antibody, described below.
          Methods of attaching an antibody to a solid support matrix are
          well-known in the art (see, for example, Harlow and Lane.
          Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Springs Harbor
          Laboratory: Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. (1988)). Alternatively,
          the solid support matrix, such as magnetic beads, can be
          coated with streptavidin, in which case the Griffithsin or
          fragment thereof (which comprises at least eight contiguous
          amino acids of SEQ ID NO: 3 or SEQ ID NO: 2) or variant
          thereof, or a conjugate or fusion protein of either one, is
          biotinylated. The at least eight contiguous amino acids of SEQ
          ID NO: 2 desirably have anti-viral activity and preferably
          bind gp120 of HIV, which preferably is infectious. Preferably,
          the anti-viral polypeptide comprises SEQ ID NO: 3 or SEQ ID
          NO: 2. Such a composition can be prepared, for example, by
          biotinylating the Griffithsin, variant, conjugate, or fusion
          protein thereof, and then contacting the biotinylated protein
          or peptide with a (commercially available) solid support
          matrix, such as magnetic beads, coated with streptavidin. The
          use of biotinylation as a means to attach a desired
          biologically active protein or peptide to a
          streptavidin-coated support matrix, such as magnetic beads, is
          well-known in the art.<br>
          <br>
          One skilled in the art will appreciate that a suitable or
          appropriate formulation can be selected, adapted or developed
          based upon the particular application at hand.<br>
          <br>
          For ex vivo uses, such as virucidal treatments of inanimate
          objects or materials, blood or blood products, or tissues, the
          amount of Griffithsin, variant, conjugate thereof, fusion
          protein thereof, or composition of any of the foregoing, to be
          employed should be sufficient that any virus or
          virus-producing cells present will be rendered noninfectious
          or will be destroyed. For example, for HIV, this would require
          that the virus and/or the virus-producing cells be exposed to
          concentrations of Griffithsin in the range of 0.1-1000 nM.
          Similar considerations apply to in vivo applications.
          Therefore, the designation of "anti-viral effective amount" is
          used generally to describe the amount of a particular
          Griffithsin, variant, conjugate, fusion protein, or
          composition thereof required for anti-viral efficacy in any
          given application.<br>
          <br>
          In view of the above, the invention also provides a method of
          inhibiting prophylactically or therapeutically a viral
          infection of a host in which an anti-viral effective amount of
          an above-described anti-viral polypeptide, variant, conjugate,
          or fusion protein is administered to the host. Upon
          administration of the anti-viral effective amount of the
          anti-viral polypeptide, variant, conjugate, or fusion protein,
          the viral infection is inhibited.<br>
          <br>
          The invention additionally provides a method of
          prophylactically or therapeutically inhibiting a viral
          infection of a host in which an anti-viral effective amount of
          a composition comprising an isolated and purified anti-viral
          polypeptide, variant, or anti-viral polypeptide conjugate or
          fusion protein, either one of which comprises at least eight
          contiguous amino acids of SEQ ID NO: 3 having anti-viral
          activity, attached to or encapsulated within a solid support
          matrix is administered to the host. By "therapeutically" is
          meant that the host already has been infected with the virus.
          By "prophylactically" is meant that the host has not yet been
          infected with the virus but is at risk of being infected with
          the virus. Prophylactic treatment is intended to encompass any
          degree of inhibition of viral infection, including, but not
          limited to, complete inhibition, as one of ordinary skill in
          the art will readily appreciate that any degree in inhibition
          of viral infection is advantageous. Preferably, the inventive
          active agent is administered before viral infection or
          immediately upon determination of viral infection and is
          continuously administered until the virus is undetectable. The
          method optionally further comprises the prior, simultaneous or
          subsequent administration, by the same route or a different
          route, of an antiviral agent or another agent that is
          efficacious in inhibiting the viral infection. Upon
          administration of the anti-viral effective amount of the
          composition, the viral infection is inhibited. Preferably, the
          solid support matrix is a contraceptive device, such as a
          condom, diaphragm, cervical cap, vaginal ring, or sponge. In
          an alternative embodiment, a solid support matrix can be
          surgically implanted and later removed.<br>
          <br>
          For in vivo uses, the dose of a Griffithsin, variant,
          conjugate, fusion protein, or composition thereof,
          administered to an animal, particularly a human, in the
          context of the invention should be sufficient to effect a
          prophylactic or therapeutic response in the individual over a
          reasonable time frame. The dose used to achieve a desired
          anti-viral concentration in vivo (e.g., 0.1-1000 nM) will be
          determined by the potency of the particular Griffithsin,
          variant, fusion protein, or conjugate employed, the severity
          of the disease state of infected individuals, as well as, in
          the case of systemic administration, the body weight and age
          of the infected individual. The size of the dose also will be
          determined by the existence of any adverse side effects that
          may accompany the particular Griffithsin, variant, fusion
          protein, or conjugate or composition thereof, employed. It is
          always desirable, whenever possible, to keep adverse side
          effects to a minimum.<br>
          <br>
          The invention also provides a method of removing virus, such
          as infectious virus, from a sample. The method comprises
          contacting the sample with a composition comprising an
          isolated and purified anti-viral polypeptide, variant,
          conjugate, or fusion protein thereof, comprising at least
          eight contiguous amino acids of SEQ ID NO: 3 (or SEQ ID NO:
          2). The at least eight contiguous amino acids desirably have
          anti-viral activity and bind to the virus and the anti-viral
          polypeptide (or conjugate or fusion protein of either of the
          foregoing) is attached to a solid support matrix, such as a
          magnetic bead. "Attached" is used herein to refer to
          attachment to (or coupling to) and immobilization in or on a
          solid support matrix. While any means of attachment can be
          used, preferably, attachment is by covalent bonds. The method
          further comprises separating the sample and the composition by
          any suitable means, whereupon the virus, such as infectious
          virus, is removed from the sample. Preferably, the anti-viral
          polypeptide comprises SEQ ID NO: 3 (or SEQ ID NO: 2). In one
          embodiment, the anti-viral polypeptide is conjugated with an
          anti-Griffithsin antibody or at least one effector component,
          which can be the same or different, selected from polyethylene
          glycol, dextran and albumin, in which case the anti-viral
          polypeptide is desirably attached to the solid support matrix
          through at least one effector component. The anti-viral
          polypeptide can be further conjugated with at least one
          effector component, which can be the same or different,
          selected from the group consisting of an immunological reagent
          and a toxin. In another embodiment, the solid support matrix
          is coated with streptavidin and the anti-viral polypeptide is
          biotinylated. Through biotin, the biotinylated anti-viral
          polypeptide is attached to the streptavidin-coated solid
          support matrix. Other types of means, as are known in the art,
          can be used to attach a functional Griffithsin (i.e., an
          anti-viral polypeptide, variant, conjugate, or fusion protein,
          as described above) to a solid support matrix, such as a
          magnetic bead, in which case contact with a magnet is used to
          separate the sample and the composition. Similarly, other
          types of solid support matrices can be used, such as a matrix
          comprising a porous surface or membrane, over or through which
          a sample is flowed or percolated, thereby selectively
          entrapping or removing infectious virus from the sample. The
          choice of solid support matrix, means of attachment of the
          functional Griffithsin to the solid support matrix, and means
          of separating the sample and the matrix-anchored Griffithsin
          will depend, in part, on the sample (e.g., fluid vs. tissue)
          and the virus to be removed. It is expected that the use of a
          selected coupling molecule can confer certain desired
          properties to a matrix, comprising a functional Griffithsin
          coupled therewith, that may have particularly advantageous
          properties in a given situation. Preferably, the sample is
          blood, a component of blood, sperm, cells, tissue or an organ.
          Also, preferably the sample is a vaccine formulation, in which
          case the virus that is removed is infectious, such as HIV,
          although HIV, in particular infectious HIV, can be removed
          from other samples in accordance with this method. In another
          embodiment, the virus that is removed is a SARS, Ebola,
          Hepatitis C, or H5N1 virus.<br>
          <br>
          For instance, the skilled practitioner might select a
          poly(ethylene glycol) molecule for attaching a functional
          Griffithsin to a solid support matrix, thereby to provide a
          matrix-anchored Griffithsin, wherein the Griffithsin is
          attached to the matrix by a longer "tether" than would be
          feasible or possible for other attachment methods, such as
          biotinylation/streptavidin coupling. A Griffithsin coupled by
          a poly(ethylene glycol) "tether" to a solid support matrix
          (such as magnetic beads, porous surface or membrane, and the
          like) can permit optimal exposure of a binding surface,
          epitope, hydrophobic or electrophilic focus, and/or the like,
          on a functional Griffithsin in a manner that, in a given
          situation and/or for a particular virus, facilitates the
          binding and/or inactivation of the virus. A preferred solid
          support matrix is a magnetic bead such that separation of the
          sample and the composition is effected by a magnet. In a
          preferred embodiment of the method, the at least eight
          contiguous amino acids bind gp120 of HIV and HIV is removed
          from the sample.<br>
          <br>
          Similarly, other types of solid support matrices can be used,
          such as a matrix comprising a porous surface or membrane, over
          or through which a sample is flowed or percolated, thereby
          selectively inhibiting infectious virus (e.g., HIV or
          influenza) in the sample. The choice of solid support matrix,
          means of attachment of the functional Griffithsin to the solid
          support matrix, and means of separating the sample and the
          matrix-anchored Griffithsin will depend, in part, on the
          sample (e.g., fluid vs. tissue) and the virus to be inhibited.
          It is expected that the use of a selected coupling molecule
          can confer certain desired properties to a matrix, comprising
          a functional Griffithsin coupled therewith, that may have
          particularly advantageous properties in a given situation.<br>
          <br>
          The methods described herein also have utility in real time ex
          vivo inhibition of virus or virus infected cells in a bodily
          fluid, such as blood, e.g., in the treatment of viral
          infection, or in the inhibition of virus in blood or a
          component of blood, e.g., for transfusion, in the inhibition
          or prevention of viral infection. Such methods also have
          potential utility in dialysis, such as kidney dialysis, and in
          inhibiting virus in sperm obtained from a donor for in vitro
          and in vivo fertilization. The methods also have applicability
          in the context of tissue and organ transplantations.<br>
          <br>
          In summary, a Griffithsin attached to a solid support matrix,
          such as a magnetic bead, can be used to remove virus, in
          particular infectious virus, including immunodeficiency virus,
          such as HIV, e.g., HIV-1 or HIV-2, SARS, Ebola, H5N1, and
          Hepatitis C, from a sample, such as a sample comprising both
          infectious and noninfectious virus. The inventive method also
          can be used to remove viral glycoprotein presenting cells,
          e.g., infected cells that have, for example, gp120 on their
          surfaces, from a sample.<br>
          <br>
          The invention, therefore, further provides a composition
          comprising naturally-occurring, non-infectious virus, such as
          a composition produced as described above. The composition can
          further comprise a carrier, such as a biologically or
          pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, and an immuno-adjuvant.
          Preferably, the noninfectious virus is an influenza (e.g.,
          H5N1), an Ebola virus, a SARS virus, a Hepatitis C virus, or
          an immunodeficiency virus, such as HIV, e.g., HIV-1 or HIV-2.
          Alternatively, and also preferably, the noninfectious virus is
          FIV. A composition comprising only naturally-occurring,
          non-infectious virus has many applications in research and the
          prophylactic treatment of a viral infection. In terms of
          prophylactic treatment of a viral infection, the skilled
          artisan will appreciate the need to eliminate completely all
          infectious virus from the composition. If desired, further
          treatment of the composition comprising non-infectious
          particles with virus-inactivating chemicals, such as imines or
          psoralens, and/or pressure or heat inactivation, will further
          the non-infectious nature of the composition. For example, an
          immune response-inducing amount of the inventive composition
          can be administered to an animal at risk for a viral infection
          in order to induce an immune response. The skilled artisan
          will appreciate that such a composition is a significant
          improvement over previously disclosed compositions in that the
          virus is non-infectious and naturally-occurring. Thus, there
          is no risk of inadvertent infection, greater doses can be
          administered in comparison to compositions comprising
          infectious viral particles, and the subsequent immune response
          will assuredly be directed to antigens present on
          naturally-occurring virus. The composition comprising
          naturally-occurring, non-infectious virus can be administered
          in any manner appropriate to induce an immune response.
          Preferably, the virus is administered, for example,
          intramuscularly, mucosally, intravenously, subcutaneously, or
          topically. Preferably, the composition comprises
          naturally-occurring, non-infectious human immunodeficiency
          virus comprising gp120.<br>
          <br>
          The composition comprising naturally-occurring, non-infectious
          virus can be combined with various carriers, adjuvants,
          diluents or other anti-viral therapeutics, if desired.
          Appropriate carriers include, for example, ovalbumin, albumin,
          globulins, hemocyanins, and the like. Adjuvants or
          immuno-adjuvants are incorporated in most cases to stimulate
          further the immune system. Any physiologically appropriate
          adjuvant can be used. Suitable adjuvants for inclusion in the
          inventive composition include, for example, aluminum
          hydroxide, beryllium sulfate, silica, kaolin, carbon,
          bacterial endotoxin, saponin, and the like.<br>
          <br>
          Thus, the invention also provides a method of inducing an
          immune response to a virus in an animal. The method comprises
          administering to the animal an immune response-inducing amount
          of a composition comprising naturally-occurring,
          non-infectious virus as described above.<br>
          <br>
          The appropriate dose of a composition comprising
          naturally-occurring, non-infectious virus required to induce
          an immune response to the virus in an animal is dependent on
          numerous factors, such as size of the animal and immune
          competency. The amount of composition administered should be
          sufficient to induce a humoral and/or cellular immune
          response. The amount of non-infectious virus in a particular
          composition can be determined using routine methods in the
          art, such as the Coulter HIV p24 antigen assay (Coulter Corp.,
          Hialeah, Fla.). Any suitable dose of a composition comprising
          non-infectious virus is appropriate so long as an immune
          response is induced, desirably without the appearance of
          harmful side effects to the host. In this regard, compositions
          comprising from about 10&lt;1 &gt;to about 10&lt;5
          &gt;particles, preferably from about 10&lt;2 &gt;to about
          10&lt;4 &gt;particles, most preferably about 10&lt;3
          &gt;particles, are suitable for inducing an immune response.<br>
          <br>
          One of ordinary skill can determine the effectiveness of the
          composition to induce an immune response using routine methods
          known in the art. Cell-mediated response can be determined by
          employing, for example, a virus antigen-stimulated T-cell
          proliferation assay. The presence of a humoral immune response
          can be determined, for instance, with the Enzyme Linked
          Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). The skilled artisan will
          appreciate that there are numerous other suitable assays for
          evaluating induction of an immune response. To the extent that
          a dose is inadequate to induce an appropriate immune response,
          "booster" administrations can subsequently be administered in
          order to prompt a more effective immune response.<br>
          <br>
          In terms of administration of the inventive anti-viral agents
          or conjugates thereof, the dosage can be in unit dosage form,
          such as a tablet or capsule. The term "unit dosage form" as
          used herein refers to physically discrete units suitable as
          unitary dosages for human and animal subjects, each unit
          containing a predetermined quantity of a Griffithsin or
          conjugate thereof, alone or in combination with other
          anti-viral agents, calculated in an amount sufficient to
          produce the desired effect in association with a
          pharmaceutically acceptable diluent, carrier, or vehicle.<br>
          <br>
          The specifications for the unit dosage forms of the invention
          depend on the particular Griffithsin, variant, fusion protein,
          conjugate, or composition thereof, employed and the effect to
          be achieved, as well as the pharmacodynamics associated with
          each Griffithsin, variant, fusion protein, conjugate, or
          composition thereof, in the host. The dose administered should
          be an "anti-viral effective amount" or an amount necessary to
          achieve an "effective level" in the individual patient.<br>
          <br>
          Since the "effective level" is used as the preferred endpoint
          for dosing, the actual dose and schedule can vary, depending
          upon interindividual differences in pharmacokinetics, drug
          distribution, and metabolism. The "effective level" can be
          defined, for example, as the blood or tissue level (e.g.,
          0.1-1000 nM) desired in the patient that corresponds to a
          concentration of one or more Griffithsin or conjugate thereof,
          which inhibits a virus, such as HIV, in an assay known to
          predict for clinical anti-viral activity of chemical compounds
          and biological agents. The "effective level" for agents of the
          invention also can vary when the Griffithsin, or conjugate or
          composition thereof, is used in combination with AZT or other
          known anti-viral compounds or combinations thereof.<br>
          <br>
          One skilled in the art can easily determine the appropriate
          dose, schedule, and method of administration for the exact
          formulation of the composition being used, in order to achieve
          the desired "effective concentration" in the individual
          patient. One skilled in the art also can readily determine and
          use an appropriate indicator of the "effective concentration"
          of the compounds of the invention by a direct (e.g.,
          analytical chemical analysis) or indirect (e.g., with
          surrogate indicators such as p24 or RT) analysis of
          appropriate patient samples (e.g., blood and/or tissues).<br>
          <br>
          In the treatment of some virally infected individuals, it can
          be desirable to utilize a "mega-dosing" regimen, wherein a
          large dose of the Griffithsin or conjugate thereof is
          administered, time is allowed for the drug to act, and then a
          suitable reagent is administered to the individual to
          inactivate the drug.<br>
          <br>
          The pharmaceutical composition can contain other
          pharmaceuticals, in conjunction with the Griffithsin, variant,
          fusion protein, or conjugate thereof, when used to
          therapeutically treat a viral infection, such as an influenza
          infection or an HIV infection which results in AIDS.
          Representative examples of these additional pharmaceuticals
          include anti-viral compounds, virucides, immunomodulators,
          immuno stimulants, antibiotics and absorption enhancers.
          Exemplary anti-viral compounds include cyanovirin, AZT, ddI,
          ddC, gancylclovir, fluorinated dideoxynucleosides,
          nonnucleoside analog compounds, such as nevirapine (Shih et
          al., PNAS, 88: 9878-9882 (1991)), TIBO derivatives, such as
          R82913 (White et al., Anti-viral Res., 16: 257-266 (1991)),
          BI-RJ-70 (Merigan, Am. J. Med., 90 (Suppl. 4A): 8S-17S
          (1991)), michellamines (Boyd et al., J. Med. Chem., 37:
          1740-1745 (1994)) and calanolides (Kashman et al., J. Med.
          Chem., 35: 2735-2743 (1992)), nonoxynol -9, gossypol and
          derivatives, gramicidin (Bourinbair et al. (1994), supra),
          neuraminidase inhibitors, amantadine, enfurtide, and the like.
          Exemplary immunomodulators and immunostimulants include
          various interleukins, sCD4, cytokines, antibody preparations,
          blood transfusions, and cell transfusions. Exemplary
          antibiotics include antifungal agents, antibacterial agents,
          and anti-Pneumocystitis carnii agents. Exemplary absorption
          enhancers include bile salts and other surfactants, saponins,
          cyclodextrins, and phospholipids (Davis (1992), supra).<br>
          <br>
          Administration of a Griffithsin, variant, conjugate, or fusion
          protein thereof with other anti-retroviral agents and
          particularly with known RT inhibitors, such as ddC, AZT, ddI,
          ddA, or other inhibitors that act against other viral, e.g.,
          HIV, proteins, such as anti-TAT agents, is expected to inhibit
          most or all replicative stages of the viral life cycle. The
          dosages of ddC and AZT used in AIDS or ARC patients have been
          published. A virustatic range of ddC is generally between 0.05
          [mu]M to 1.0 [mu]M. A range of about 0.005-0.25 mg/kg body
          weight is virustatic in most patients. The preliminary dose
          ranges for oral administration are somewhat broader, for
          example 0.001 to 0.25 mg/kg given in one or more doses at
          intervals of 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, etc. hours. Currently, 0.01 mg/kg
          body weight ddC given every 8 hrs is preferred. When given in
          combined therapy, the other anti-viral compound, for example,
          can be given at the same time as the Griffithsin or conjugate
          thereof or the dosing can be staggered as desired. The two
          drugs also can be combined in a composition. Doses of each can
          be less when used in combination than when either is used
          alone.<br>
          <br>
          It will also be appreciated by one skilled in the art that a
          DNA sequence of a Griffithsin, variant, conjugate, or fusion
          protein thereof of the invention can be inserted ex vivo into
          mammalian cells previously removed from a given animal, in
          particular a human, host. Such cells can be employed to
          express the corresponding Griffithsin, variant, conjugate or
          fusion protein in vivo after reintroduction into the host.
          Feasibility of such a therapeutic strategy to deliver a
          therapeutic amount of an agent in close proximity to the
          desired target cells and pathogens, i.e., virus, more
          particularly SARS, Ebola, Hepatitis C, H5N1, and retrovirus,
          specifically HIV and its envelope glycoprotein gp120, has been
          demonstrated in studies with cells engineered ex vivo to
          express sCD4 (Morgan et al. (1994), supra). It is also
          possible that, as an alternative to ex vivo insertion of the
          DNA sequences of the invention, such sequences can be inserted
          into cells directly in vivo, such as by use of an appropriate
          viral vector. Such cells transfected in vivo are expected to
          produce anti-viral amounts of Griffithsin, variant, conjugate,
          or fusion protein thereof directly in vivo.<br>
          <br>
          Given the present disclosure, it will be additionally
          appreciated that a DNA sequence corresponding to a
          Griffithsin, variant, fusion protein, or conjugate thereof can
          be inserted into suitable nonmammalian host cells, and that
          such host cells will express therapeutic or prophylactic
          amounts of a Griffithsin, variant, conjugate, or fusion
          protein thereof directly in vivo within a desired body
          compartment of an animal, in particular a human. Example 5
          illustrates the transformation and expression of effective
          virucidal amounts of a Griffithsin in a non-mammalian cell,
          more specifically a bacterial cell. In a preferred embodiment
          of the invention, a method of female-controllable prophylaxis
          against HIV infection comprises the intravaginal
          administration and/or establishment of, in a female human, a
          persistent intravaginal population of lactobacilli that have
          been transformed with a coding sequence of the invention to
          produce, over a prolonged time, effective virucidal levels of
          a Griffithsin, variant, fusion protein, or conjugate thereof,
          directly on or within the vaginal and/or cervical and/or
          uterine mucosa. It is noteworthy that both the World Health
          Organization (WHO), as well as the U.S. National Institute of
          Allergy and Infectious Diseases, have pointed to the need for
          development of female-controlled topical microbicides,
          suitable for blocking the transmission of HIV, as an urgent
          global priority (Lange et al., Lancet, 341: 1356 (1993);
          Fauci, NIAID News, Apr. 27, 1995). A composition comprising
          the inventive anti-viral agent and a solid-support matrix is
          particularly useful in this regard, particularly when the
          solid-support matrix is a contraceptive device, such as a
          condom, a diaphragm, a cervical cap, a vaginal ring, or a
          sponge. In another embodiment, a colony of commensal organisms
          transduced with the nucleic acid of the invention and
          producing the inventive anti-viral agent is applied to mucosal
          tissue associated with the onset of influenza infection, such
          as respiratory or oral mucosal.<br>
          <br>
          The invention also provides antibodies directed to the
          polypeptides of the invention. The availability of antibodies
          to any given protein is highly advantageous, as it provides
          the basis for a wide variety of qualitative and quantitative
          analytical methods, separation and purification methods, and
          other useful applications directed to the subject
          polypeptides. Accordingly, given the present disclosure and
          the polypeptides of the invention, it will be readily apparent
          to one skilled in the art that antibodies, in particular
          antibodies specifically binding to a polypeptide of the
          invention, can be prepared using well-established
          methodologies (e.g., such as the methodologies described in
          detail by Harlow and Lane, in Antibodies. A Laboratory Manual,
          Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor (1988), pp.
          1-725). Such antibodies can comprise both polyclonal and
          monoclonal antibodies. Furthermore, such antibodies can be
          obtained and employed either in solution-phase or coupled to a
          desired solid-phase matrix, such as magnetic beads or a flow
          through matrix. Having in hand such antibodies as provided by
          the invention, one skilled in the art will further appreciate
          that such antibodies, in conjunction with well-established
          procedures (e.g., such as described by Harlow and Lane (1988),
          supra) comprise useful methods for the detection,
          quantification, or purification of a Griffithsin, conjugate
          thereof, or host cell transformed to produce a Griffithsin or
          conjugate or fusion protein thereof. Example 6 further
          illustrates an antibody that specifically binds to a
          Griffithsin. Accordingly, the invention further provides a
          composition comprising an anti-Griffithsin antibody bound to
          the anti-viral agent of the invention, preferably an
          anti-viral polypeptide comprising at least eight contiguous
          amino acids of SEQ ID NO: 3.<br>
          <br>
          Matrix-anchored anti-Griffithsin antibodies also can be used
          in a method to remove virus in a sample. Preferably, the
          antibody binds to an epitope of an anti-viral polypeptide of
          SEQ ID NO: 2 or SEQ ID NO: 3. Preferably, the matrix is a
          solid support matrix, such as a magnetic bead or a
          flow-through matrix. If the solid support matrix to which the
          anti-Griffithsin antibody is attached comprises magnetic
          beads, removal of the antibody-Griffithsin-virus complex can
          be readily accomplished using a magnet.<br>
          <br>
          In view of the above, the invention provides a method of
          removing virus from a sample. The method comprises (a)
          contacting the sample with a composition comprising an
          isolated and purified anti-viral polypeptide, variant, or
          conjugate or fusion protein thereof, wherein (i) the
          anti-viral polypeptide comprises at least eight contiguous
          amino acids of SEQ ID NO: 3, and (ii) the at least eight
          contiguous amino acids bind to the virus, and (b) contacting
          the sample with an anti-Griffithsin antibody attached to a
          solid support matrix, whereupon the anti-Griffithsin antibody
          binds to the anti-viral polypeptide or conjugate or fusion
          protein thereof to which is bound the virus, and (c)
          separating the solid support matrix from the sample, whereupon
          the virus is removed from the sample. Preferably, the
          anti-viral polypeptide comprises SEQ ID NO: 3. The virus that
          is removed can be any virus, e.g., a Hepatitis C, SARS, Ebola,
          and H5N1 virus. Desirably, the virus that is removed is
          infectious, such as HIV, Hepatitis C, Ebola, SARS, and H5N1.
          The sample can be blood, a component of blood, sperm, cells,
          tissue or an organ.<br>
          <br>
          The antibody for use in the aforementioned method is an
          antibody that binds to a polypeptide comprising at least eight
          contiguous amino acids of SEQ ID NO: 3, and, which polypeptide
          can bind to and inactivate a virus. The antibody can be
          coupled to the solid support matrix using similar methods and
          with similar considerations as described above for attaching a
          Griffithsin to a solid support matrix. For example, coupling
          methods and molecules employed to attach an anti-Griffithsin
          antibody to a solid support matrix, such as magnetic beads or
          a flow-through matrix, can employ biotin/streptavidin coupling
          or coupling through molecules, such as polyethylene glycol,
          albumin or dextran. Also analogously, it can be shown that,
          after such coupling, the matrix-anchored anti-Griffithsin
          antibody retains its ability to bind to a polypeptide
          comprising at least eight contiguous amino acids of SEQ ID NO:
          3, which polypeptide can bind to and inactivate a virus.<br>
          <br>
          The invention also provides an anti-Griffithsin antibody that
          is anti-idiotypic in respect to a viral glycoprotein, such as
          gp120, i.e., has an internal image of gp120 of a primate
          immunodeficiency virus. Preferably, the antibody can compete
          with gp120 of a primate immunodeficiency virus for binding to
          a Griffithsin. In this regard, the primary immunodeficiency
          virus preferably is HIV-1 or HIV-2 and the Griffithsin
          preferably consists essentially of SEQ ID NO: 2 or SEQ ID NO:
          3. Anti-idiotypic antibodies can be generated in accordance
          with methods known in the art (see, for example, Benjamin, in
          Immunology: a short course, Wiley-Liss, NY (1996), pp.
          436-437; Kuby, in Immunology, 3rd ed., Freeman, N.Y. (1997),
          pp. 455-456; Greenspan et al., FASEB J., 7: 437-443 (1993);
          and Poskitt, Vaccine, 9: 792-796 (1991)). Such an
          anti-idiotypic (in respect to gp120) anti-Griffithsin antibody
          is useful in a method of inhibiting infection of an animal
          with a virus as provided herein.<br>
          <br>
          In view of the above, a Griffithsin can be administered to an
          animal, the animal generates anti-Griffithsin antibodies,
          among which are antibodies that have an internal image of a
          viral glycoprotein, such as gp120. In accordance with
          well-known methods, polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies can be
          obtained, isolated, and selected. Selection of an
          anti-Griffithsin antibody that has an internal image of gp120
          can be based upon competition between the anti-Griffithsin
          antibody and gp120 for binding to a Griffithsin, or upon the
          ability of the anti-Griffithsin antibody to bind to a free
          Griffithsin as opposed to a Griffithsin bound to gp120. Such
          an anti-Griffithsin antibody can be administered to an animal
          to inhibit a viral infection in accordance with methods
          provided herein. Although nonhuman anti-idiotypic antibodies,
          such as an anti-Griffithsin antibody that has an internal
          image of gp120 and, therefore, is anti-idiotypic to gp120, are
          proving useful as vaccine antigens in humans, their favorable
          properties might, in certain instances, be further enhanced
          and/or their adverse properties further diminished, through
          "humanization" strategies, such as those recently reviewed by
          Vaughan (Nature Biotech., 16: 535-539 (1998)). Alternatively,
          a Griffithsin can be directly administered to an animal to
          inhibit a viral infection in accordance with methods provided
          herein such that the treated animal, itself, generates an
          anti-Griffithsin antibody that has an internal image of gp120.
          The production of anti-idiotypic antibodies, such as
          anti-Griffithsin antibody that has an internal image of gp120
          and, therefore, is anti-idiotypic to gp120, in an animal to be
          treated is known as "anti-idiotype induction therapy," and is
          described by Madiyalakan et al. (Hybridoma, 14: 199-203
          (1995)), for example.<br>
          <br>
          In view of the above, the invention enables another method of
          inhibiting infection of an animal, such as a mammal, in
          particular a human, with a virus. The method comprises
          administering to the animal an anti-Griffithsin antibody, or a
          composition comprising same, in an amount sufficient to induce
          in the animal an immune response to the virus, whereupon the
          infection of the animal with the virus is inhibited.
          Preferably, the anti-Griffithsin antibody has an internal
          image of a viral glycoprotein, such as gp120 of an
          immunodeficiency virus with which the animal can be infected,
          such as a primate immunodeficiency virus. Preferably, the
          antibody can compete with, for example, gp120 of a primate
          immunodeficiency virus for binding to a Griffithsin. In this
          regard, the primate immunodeficiency virus preferably is HIV-1
          or HIV-2 and the Griffithsin preferably consists essentially
          of SEQ ID NO: 3 or SEQ ID NO: 2. The method can further
          comprise the administration of an immunostimulant.<br>
          <br>
          Also enabled by the invention is yet another method of
          inhibiting infection of an animal, such as a mammal, in
          particular a human, with a virus. The method comprises
          administering to the animal a Griffithsin, which binds a viral
          glycoprotein, such as gp120 of an immunodeficiency virus with
          which the animal can be infected, in an amount sufficient to
          induce in the animal an anti-Griffithsin antibody in an amount
          sufficient to induce an immune response to a virus sufficient
          to inhibit infection of the animal with the virus. Preferably,
          the anti-Griffithsin antibody has an internal image of gp120
          of an immunodeficiency virus with which the animal can be
          infected, such as a primate immunodeficiency virus.
          Preferably, the antibody can compete with gp120 of a primate
          immunodeficiency virus for binding to a Griffithsin. In this
          regard, the primate immunodeficiency virus preferably is HIV-1
          or HIV-2 and the Griffithsin preferably consists essentially
          of SEQ ID NO: 2 or SEQ ID NO: 3.<br>
          <br>
          With respect to the above methods, sufficient amounts can be
          determined in accordance with methods known in the art.
          Similarly, the sufficiency of an immune response in the
          inhibition of a viral infection in an animal also can be
          assessed in accordance with methods known in the art.<br>
          <br>
          Either one of the above methods can further comprise
          concurrent, pre- or post-treatment with an adjuvant to enhance
          the immune response, such as the prior, simultaneous or
          subsequent administration, by the same or a different route,
          of an antiviral agent or another agent that is efficacious in
          inducing an immune response to the virus, such as an
          immunostimulant. See, for example, Harlow et al. (1988),
          supra.<br>
          The inventive Griffithsins, conjugates, host cells,
          antibodies, compositions and methods are further described in
          the context of the following examples. These examples serve to
          illustrate further the present invention and are not intended
          to limit the scope of the invention.<br>
          <br>
          <b>EXAMPLES</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          Example 1<br>
          <br>
          This example illustrates a method of isolating and purifying
          Griffithsin from Griffithsia sp. and elucidating the
          Griffithsin amino acid sequence.<br>
          <br>
          Anti-HIV bioassay guided fractionation was used to track the
          isolation of the Griffithsin polypeptide. In brief, the
          cellular mass from Griffithsia sp. was harvested by
          filtration, freeze-dried, and extracted first with H2O
          followed by (1:1) MeOH-CH2O2. Individual aliquots of the
          organic and aqueous extracts were tested for cytoprotective
          properties in the NCI primary anti-HIV screen (Weislow et al.
          J. Natl. Cancer Inst., 81: 577-586 (1989)). Only the H2O
          extract showed anti-HIV activity.<br>
          <br>
          A freeze-dried aqueous extract (10 g) was brought to a
          concentration of 50 mg/ml by addition of DDH2O and maintained
          on ice. Crystalline ammonium sulfate (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.;
          molecular biology grade) was added to the solution such that
          the final concentration of the mixture was 75% saturation. The
          mixture was allowed to precipitate on ice over night, and was
          then centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 50 min. The resulting pellets
          were set aside. The supernatant was brought to 1 M ammonium
          sulfate followed by another round of precipitation and
          centrifugation. The pellets from the second centrifugation
          were saved, and the resulting supernatant was filtered using a
          0.22 [mu]m filter and subjected to hydrophobic interaction
          chromatography. A BioCad workstation (Perseptive Biosystems)
          was used for the following column chromatographies. The
          protein solution from the centrifugation and filtration steps
          was injected onto a Poros PE column (10*100 mm, Perseptive
          Biosystems) pre-equilibrated with a starting buffer of 50 mM
          sodium phosphate, 1.5 M ammonium sulfate, pH 7.5. The column
          was eluted at a flow rate of 15 ml/min over the following
          gradient: (1) 7 column volumes (CV, equal to 7.85 ml) of the
          starting buffer; (2) 1.5-0 M ammonium sulfate over 2 CV; (3) 0
          M ammonium sulfate for 15 CV. The eluate was monitored for
          both conductivity and absorbance (280 nm). Ammonium sulfate
          was added to the void fraction possessing anti-HIV activity to
          bring the final concentration to 75% saturation. The mixture
          was allowed to precipitate on ice overnight, and was then
          centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 50 min. DDH2O-resuspended pellets
          were first concentrated using a 10 kDa molecular weight limit
          membrane, dialyzed against 0.02% sodium azide, and then
          brought up to a concentration of 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.5. The
          resulting protein solution was injected onto a Poros HQ anion
          exchange column (10*100 mm, Perseptive Biosystems)
          pre-equilibrated with a starting buffer of 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH
          8.5. The column was eluted at a flow rate of 15 ml/min using
          the following gradient: (1) 5 CV of the starting buffer; (2)
          0-1 M sodium chloride over 20 CV; (3) 1 M sodium chloride for
          5 CV. The eluate was monitored for absorbance (280 nm). Active
          fractions from the HQ column were concentrated and desalted
          using a 10 kDa molecular weight limit membrane and subjected
          to a Bio-RP C4 reverse phase column (4.6*100 mm, Covance,
          Princeton, N.J.) and eluted at a flow rate of 4 ml/min using
          the following gradient: (1) 10 CV of the starting buffer of 5%
          acetonitrile in H2O; (2) 5-95% acetonitrile in H2O over 2.5
          CV; (3) 95% acetonitrile in H2O for 5 CV. The eluate was
          monitored for absorbance (280 nm), and the active fraction was
          pooled, lyophilized, and resuspended in phosphate-buffered
          saline (PBS), pH 7.4. The protein solution was injected onto a
          G3000PW gel permeation column (21.5*600 mm, TosoHaas,
          Montgomeryville, Pa.) and eluted with PBS, pH 7.4, at a flow
          rate of 5 ml/min.<br>
          <br>
          Molecular mass and purity (&gt;99%) of Griffithsin were
          confirmed by Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry
          (ESI-MS), and the protein concentrations were determined by
          amino acid analysis. Native molecular weight was determined by
          calibrating standard proteins (albumin (68 kDa), cytochrome c
          (12.5 kDa), and aprotinin (6.5 kDa)) by their retention time
          (as measured by absorbance at 280 nm) and comparing the
          resulting calibration curve to the retention time of the
          active protein. Amino acid analysis was accomplished using a
          Beckman Model 6300 Automated Amino Acid Analyzer according to
          manufacturer protocols. N-terminal amino acid sequencing was
          performed using an Applied Biosystems Model 4774A Sequencer
          according to manufacturer protocols. Matrix-assisted laser
          desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectroscopy
          (MALDI-TOF MS) was performed using a Kratos Kompact Maldi III
          instrument (Shimadzu, Columbia, Md.) operated in a linear mode
          using sinapinic acid as a matrix and trypsin as an external
          standard. ESI-MS was performed with a JEOL SX102 equipped with
          an Analytica electrospray source. The spectrometer was
          calibrated using a lysozyme standard (molecular
          weight=14305.2) prior to each analysis. Samples were injected
          into the source in a 1:1 solution of hexafluorosopropanol and
          2% acetic acid. The masses reported were averages calculated
          from the various charged states observed.<br>
          <br>
          Griffithsin was subjected to digestion with cyanogen bromide
          (CNBr) and a variety of endoproteinases (Lys-C, Arg-C, and
          Asp-N) per manufacturer's instructions. The cleaved peptide
          products were purified by reversed-phase HPLC using a gradient
          of 0.05% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid for 20 min, then
          increasing to 60% acetonitrile in 0.05% aqueous
          trifluoroacetic acid over 100 min. Amino acid sequences were
          determined by sequential Edman degradation using an Applied
          Biosystems Model 494 sequencer according to the protocols of
          the manufacturer, and the masses of cleaved peptides were
          analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer. The amino acid
          sequence of the native Griffithsin polypeptide is set forth as
          SEQ ID NO: 3.<br>

          In summary, the preliminary analysis of the crude aqueous
          extract of algae Griffithsia sp. in the NCI's primary in vitro
          anti-HIV screening assay (Weislow et al., supra) identified a
          protein that bound soluble gp120. The process described herein
          is illustrated in FIG. 1. Anti-HIV bioassay-guided
          fractionation of the aqueous resulted in the isolation of
          Griffithsin. The aqueous extract was subjected to ammonium
          sulfate precipitation, hydrophobic interaction chromatography,
          anion exchange chromatography, reversed-phase chromatography,
          and size exclusion chromatography to produce a homogeneous
          protein fraction. SDS-PAGE analysis showed a single protein
          band with a relative molecular mass of approximately 13 kDa,
          named Griffithsin. Purified Griffithsin exhibited a single
          band by immunoblotting with anti-Griffithsin polyclonal
          antibodies. The amino acid sequence of the purified
          Griffithsin was established by N-terminal Edman degradation of
          the intact protein and by N-terminal sequencing of peptide
          fragments cleaved by CNBr and a variety of endopeptidases
          (Lys-C, Arg-C, and Asp-N) followed by reversed phase
          purification and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometric analysis. The
          entire 121 amino acid sequence was established except for a
          single amino acid at position 31, which does not match any of
          the common amino acids. Electrospray ionization mass
          spectrometric analysis of isolated Griffithsin showed a
          molecular ion with m/z 12,770.05, and the calculated value for
          the deduced amino acid sequence without amino acid at position
          31 was m/z 12619.00. It was deduced that the molecular mass of
          the amino acid at position 31 was 151.05. The amino acid
          analysis of Griffithsin also agreed with the deduced primary
          sequence. These data fully support the proposed primary amino
          acid sequence of Griffithsin. A search of the BLAST database
          (Altschul et al., Nucleic Acids Res, 25(17), 3389-3402 (1997))
          for identification of protein sequence similarities did not
          reveal any homologies of greater than eight contiguous amino
          acids nor &gt;30% total sequence homology between Griffithsin
          and any amino acid sequences of known proteins or
          transcription products of known nucleotide sequences,
          including the anti-HIV proteins cyanovirin-N and scytovirin.<br>

          <b>Example 2</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          This example demonstrates the synthesis of Griffithsin genes.
          The methods described herein are illustrated in FIG. 2.<br>
          <br>
          The chemically deduced amino acid sequence of Griffithsin was
          back-translated to elucidate the corresponding DNA coding
          sequence. Since amino acid residue 31 of native Griffithsin
          did not appear to be one of the twenty common amino acids,
          alanine was substituted in this position (SEQ ID NO: 2). In
          order to facilitate initial production and purification of
          recombinant Griffithsin, a commercial expression vector
          pET-26b(+), from Novagen, Inc., Madison, Wis., for which
          reagents were available for affinity purification and
          detection, was selected. Appropriate restriction sites for
          ligation to pET-26b(+), and a stop codon, were included in the
          DNA sequence. SEQ ID NO: 1 is an example of a DNA sequence
          encoding a synthetic Griffithsin gene. A flowchart
          illustrating a method of synthesizing of a Griffithsin gene is
          shown in FIG. 2.<br>
          <br>
          A Griffithsin-encoding DNA sequence was synthesized as 13
          overlapping, complementary oligonucleotides and assembled to
          form the double-stranded coding sequence. Oligonucleotide
          elements of the synthetic DNA coding sequence were synthesized
          using a nucleic acid synthesizer (model 394, Applied
          Biosystems Inc., Foster City, Calif.). The purified 13
          oligonucleotides were individually treated with T4
          polynucleotide kinase, and 1 nM quantities of each were pooled
          and boiled for 10 minutes to ensure denaturation. The
          temperature of the mixture was then reduced to 70[deg.] C. for
          annealing of the complementary strands for 15 minutes, and
          further reduced to 60[deg.] C. for 15 minutes. The reaction
          was cooled on ice and T4 DNA ligase (2,000 units) additional
          ligase buffer was added to the reaction. Ligation of the
          oligonucleotides was performed with T4 DNA ligase overnight at
          16[deg.] C. The resulting DNA was recovered and purified from
          the reaction buffer by phenol:chloroform extraction, ethanol
          precipitation, and further washing with ethanol.<br>
          <br>
          The purified, double-stranded synthetic DNA was then used as a
          template in a polymerase chain reaction (PCR). One [mu]l of
          the DNA solution obtained after purification of the ligation
          reaction mixture was used as a template. Thermal cycling was
          performed using a Perkin-Elmer instrument. "Pfu" thermostable
          DNA polymerase, restriction enzymes, T4 DNA ligase, and
          polynucleotide kinase were obtained from Stratagene, La Jolla,
          Calif. Pfu polymerase was selected for this application
          because of its claimed superiority in fidelity compared to the
          usual Taq enzyme. The PCR reaction product was run on a 2%
          agarose gel in TAE buffer. The 465 base pair DNA construct was
          cut from the gel and purified. The purified DNA, which was
          digested with Nde I and Xho I restriction enzymes, was then
          ligated into the multicloning site of the pet-26b(+) vector.<br>
          <br>
          E. coli were transfected with the generated
          pET-26b(+)-construct, and recombinant clones were identified
          by analysis of restriction digests of plasmid DNA. Sequence
          analysis of one of these selected clones indicated that three
          bases deviated from the intended coding sequence. These
          "mutations," which presumably arose during the PCR
          amplification of the synthetic template, were corrected by a
          site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene, La Jolla,
          Calif. The repair was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis.<br>
          <br>
          For preparation of a DNA sequence encoding a Griffithsin
          polypeptide tagged with a penta-His peptide at the C-terminal
          end of Griffithsin (e.g., SEQ ID NO: 4), the aforementioned
          recombinant Griffithsin construct was subjected to
          site-directed mutagenesis to eliminate stop codons located
          between the Griffithsin coding sequence and the penta-His
          peptide coding sequence using a site-directed mutagenesis kit
          from Stratagene, La Jolla, Calif. A pair of mutagenic
          oligonucleotide primers were synthesized, which included
          portions of the codons encoding the Griffithsin polypeptide
          and penta-His peptide, but lacked the stop codons. Annealing
          of these mutagenic primers with the template DNA and extension
          by DNA polymerase resulted in the generation of a DNA
          construct encoding a fusion protein comprising the Griffithsin
          amino acid sequence linked to a penta-His peptide tag. DNA
          sequencing verified the presence of the intended sequence.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Example 3</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          This example demonstrates the expression of an N-terminal
          His-tagged-Griffithsin gene.<br>
          <br>
          A recombinant Griffithsin protein and a C-terminal, His-tagged
          Griffithsin protein encoded by the nucleic acids of Example 2
          did not efficiently translocate to the periplasmic fraction of
          E. coli following protein expression. In addition, the
          majority of the produced proteins accumulated in the inclusion
          bodies of E. coli without the cleavage of a pelB signal
          sequence located at the N-terminus of the Griffithsin protein.
          Thus, steps were taken to express Griffithsin in the cytosolic
          fraction of E. coli.<br>
          <br>
          The pET-26b(+)-Griffithsin DNA construct was used as a
          template PCR using a pair of appropriate primers. The PCR
          product was designed to have a "penta-His" peptide and
          thrombin recognition site at the N-terminal end of the
          Griffithsin polypeptide, providing for production of a
          N-terminal, His-tagged-Griffithsin fusion protein. The PCR
          reaction product was purified from an agarose gel. The
          purified DNA, which was digested with Nco I and Xho I
          restriction enzymes, was ligated into the expression vector
          pET-28a(+) vector (Novagen, Inc., Madison, Wis.).<br>
          <br>
          E. coli (strain BL21(DE3)) were transfected with the
          pET-28a(+) vector containing the nucleic acid coding sequence
          for the His-tagged-Griffithsin fusion protein (see SEQ ID NO:
          4). Selected clones were seeded into small-scale shake flasks
          containing LB growth medium with 30 [mu]g/ml kanamycin and
          expanded by incubation at 37[deg.] C. Larger-scale Erlenmeyer
          flasks (0.5-3.0 liters) were then seeded. The culture was
          allowed to grow to a density of 0.5-0.7 OD600 units. The
          expression of the His-tagged-Griffithsin fusion protein was
          induced by adding IPTG to a final concentration of 1 mM and
          continuing incubation at 37[deg.] C. for 3-6 hrs. Bacteria
          were harvested by centrifugation, and the soluble fraction was
          obtained using BugBuster(TM) reagent and Benzonase nuclease
          (Novagen, Inc., Madison, Wis.). Crude soluble fractions showed
          both anti-HIV activity and presence of a
          His-tagged-Griffithsin fusion protein by Western-blotting. In
          addition, the His-tagged-Griffithsin protein accumulated in
          the inclusion bodies of E. coli. A flowchart illustrating a
          method of expressing and purifying recombinant
          His-tagged-Griffithsin is shown in FIG. 3.<br>
          <br>
          The purity (~98%) of recombinant His-tagged Griffithsin was
          confirmed by SDS-PAGE on 16% Tricine gel stained by Coomassie
          Blue staining. The protein showed the expected molecular mass
          for Griffithsin (i.e., 14.6 kDa). Protein concentrations were
          determined based on extinction coefficient at 280 nm of the
          protein. Approximately 1.6 mg of recombinant His-tagged
          Griffithsin was purified from 1 L of E. coli culture. The
          purified protein demonstrated 120-binding and anti-viral
          activity equivalent to that of native Griffithsin.<br>
          <br>
          This example illustrates a method of producing recombinant
          Griffithsin, which displays physical and functional properties
          similar, if not identical, to that of natural Griffithsin.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Example 4</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          This example describes a method of purifying a recombinant
          His-tagged-Griffithsin protein.<br>
          <br>
          Using an immobilized metal affinity chromatography set-up
          including Ni-NTA agarose (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, Calif.), a
          His-tagged-Griffithsin fusion protein (as described in Example
          3) was purified.<br>
          The soluble fraction described in Example 3 was loaded onto 20
          ml gravity columns containing affinity matrix. The columns
          were washed extensively with washing buffer (50 mM NaH2PO4,
          300 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, pH 8.0) to remove contaminating
          proteins. Since His-tagged Griffithsin cannot compete for
          binding sites on the Ni-NTA resin if the imidazole
          concentration is increased to 100-250 mM, the His-tagged
          Griffithsin protein was eluted by applying elution buffer (50
          mM NaH2PO4, 300 mM NaCl, 250 mM imidazole, pH 8.0) through the
          column. Column fractions and wash volumes were monitored by
          Western-blot analysis using Penta-His(TM) antibody (QIAGEN
          Inc., Valencia, Calif.) or anti-Griffithsin antibody.
          Fractions containing the purified His-tagged Griffithsin
          protein were pooled, dialyzed extensively against distilled
          water, and lyophilized.<br>
          Potent cytoprotective and anti-replicative activities of both
          natural and His-tagged recombinant Griffithsin were observed
          using the HIV-1RF strain of HIB in CEM-SS cells. Both the
          natural and recombinant Griffithsin polypeptides demonstrated
          a concentration-dependent inhibition of virus-induced cell
          killing. Griffithsin treatment also resulted in concomitant
          decreases in supernatant reverse transcriptase and viral core
          antigen, p24. Mid-to-high picomolar concentrations of
          Griffithsin exhibited comparably potent activity against all
          of the representative T-tropic laboratory strains and primary
          isolates as well as M-tropic primary isolates. In the
          antiviral assays, there was little or no evidence of direct
          cytotoxicity of Griffithsin to the uninfected control cells at
          the highest tested concentrations of Griffithsin (78.3 to 783
          nM). Griffithsin-pretreated uninfected CEM-SS cells retained
          normal susceptibility to HIV infection after the removal of
          Griffithsin. In contrast, infectivity of cell-free virus was
          abolished after pretreatment and removal of Griffithsin. These
          results indicate that Griffithsin is a virucide. Cocultivation
          of uninfected and chronically infected CEM-SS with Griffithsin
          resulted in concentration-dependent inhibition of cell-cell
          fusion. Additional binding and fusion inhibition assay using
          [beta]-gal indicator cells showed similar results. Griffithsin
          inhibited fusion of CD4 [beta]-gal cells with HL 2/3 cells and
          also inhibited cell-free HIV-1IIIB fusion and infection of
          [beta]-gal cells in a concentration-dependent manner.<br>

          Pure proteins were initially evaluated for antiviral activity
          using an XTT-tetrazolium anti-HIV assay described previously

          N.Y.), without phenol red, supplemented with 5% fetal bovine
          serum, 2 mM L-Glutamine, and 50 mg/ml Gentamicin (complete

          were thawed immediately before use and resuspended in complete
          medium to yield 1.2*10&lt;5 &gt;SFU/ml. The appropriate
          amounts of the pure proteins for anti-HIV evaluations were
          dissolved in H2O-DMSO (3:1), then diluted in complete medium
          to the desired initial concentration. All serial drug
          dilutions, reagent additions, and plate-to-plate transfers
          were carried out with an automated Biomek 1000 Workstation

          <b>Example 6</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          This example demonstrates that HIV viral envelope gp120 is the
          principal target for Griffithsin.<br>
          <br>
          To determine the affinity of Griffithsin for a series of
          protein standards, 100 ng each of gp160, gp120, gp41, sCD4,
          bovine IgG, [alpha]-acid glycoprotein, and aprotinin were
          subjected to ELISA as previously described (Bokesch et al.,
          Biochemistry, 42: 2578-2584 (2003)). Briefly, the protein
          standards were bound to a 96-well plate, which was rinsed with
          PBST (three times) and blocked with BSA. Between each step of
          the protocol, the plate was rinsed with PBST (three times).
          The protein standards were incubated with Griffithsin (100
          ng/well), followed by incubation with a 1:500 dilution of an
          anti-Griffithsin rabbit polyclonal antibody preparation.
          Griffithsin bound to the protein standards was detected by
          adding goat-anti-rabbit antibodies conjugated to alkaline
          phosphatase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis,
          Ind.). Upon addition of alkaline phosphatase substrate buffer,
          absorbance was measured at 405 nm for each well.
          Glycosylation-dependent binding of Griffithsin to gp120 was
          examined using an ELISA as above, with glycosylated and
          nonglycosylated gp120 (HIV-1SF2 gp120) added to the 96-well
          plate and incubated with serial dilutions of Griffithsin.<br>
          <br>
          Griffithsin was tested for its ability to bind HIV envelope
          glycoproteins. Evidence for direct interaction of Griffithsin
          with gp120, gp160, and to a lesser degree, gp41 was obtained
          from ELISA experiments (FIG. 5a). There was little or no
          detectable interaction between Griffithsin and cCD4 or other
          reference proteins, including bovine IgG, [alpha]-acid
          glycoprotein, and aprotinin. An additional ELISA experiment
          showed that binding of Griffithsin to sgp120 is both
          concentration-dependent and glycosylation-dependent (FIG. 5b).<br>
          <br>
          To undertake preliminary mapping studies to define
          Griffithsin-binding site on the gp120, we evaluated the effect
          of Griffithsin on the reactivity of soluble CD4 (sCD4),
          cyanovirin-N, and a panel of monoclonal antibodies (mAb) with
          soluble gp120 (sgp120) in an ELISA format assay. These studies
          demonstrated that Griffithsin interfered strongly with
          recognition of sgp120 by the mAbs 48d and 2G12. Griffithsin
          moderately interfered with sCD4 and mAb IgG 1b12 binding to
          sgp120. Griffithsin had little or no effect on the recognition
          of sgp120 by mAbs that recognize the C1 region (or V3 loop),
          and the mAb 17b. However, additional studies demonstrated that
          pretreatment of sgp120 with sCD4 and the mAbs IgG1b12, 48d,
          and 2G12 did not block subsequent binding of Griffithsin to
          sgp120. Cyanovirin-N interfered strongly with the recognition
          of sgp120 by Griffithsin. On the other hand, Griffithsin
          pretreatment of sgp120 did not block subsequent binding of
          cyanovirin-N to sgp120.<br>
          <br>
          Since Griffithsin inhibited viral entry, we compared matched
          control and Griffithsin-treated sgp120 preparations in a flow
          cytometric sgp120/CD4-expressing cell binding assay to
          determine whether Griffithsin inhibits viral attachment or
          subsequent fusion events. The CEM-SS cell line expresses CD4,
          as demonstrated by the binding of target cells with both
          anti-Leu3a and anti-OKT4 monoclonal antibodies. After
          incubation of CEM-SS cells with sgp120, the cells were stained
          by anti-gp120 mAb-FITC. A concomitant decrease in the
          availability of the Leu3a epitope (i.e., the gp120-binding
          site on target cells) was observed. In other words, the sgp120
          bound to the gp120 binding site on the target cells. As
          expected, little change in the staining specific for the OKT4
          epitope (i.e., a non-gp120 binding site) was observed. These
          results are consistent with sgp120 binding of CD4 on the
          target cells. Pretreatment of sgp120 with Griffithsin
          substantially recovered the availability of the Leu3a epitope,
          indicating that Griffithsin completely blocked CD4-dependent
          sgp120 binding. However, overall sgp120 binding showed two
          peaks in the flow cytometry data when Griffithsin-treated
          sgp120 was added to the cells. The decreased signal suggests
          inhibition of sgp120 binding to CD4 by Griffithsin, which was
          consistent with the recovery of the availability of the Leu3a
          epitope. The increased signal suggests that the
          Griffithsin/sgp120 complex also non-specifically bound to
          target cells.<br>
          <br>
          This example demonstrates that Griffithsin binds to a region
          of gp120 that recognizes CD4 on host cells.<br>

          This example illustrates the broad-range anti-HIV activity of
          Griffithsin.<br>
          <br>
          Anti-viral assays used to study the activities of laboratory
          strains and primary isolates of virus have been previously
          published (Buckheit et al., Antiviral Res., 21: 247-265
          (1993)). The low passage HIV-1 pediatric isolate ROJO was
          derived as previously described (Buckheit et al., AIDS Res.
          Hum. Retroviruses, 10: 1497-1506 (1994)). Peripheral blood
          mononuclear cells (PBMC) and macrophages were isolated from
          hepatitis and HIV sero-negative donors following
          Ficoll-Hypaque centrifugation as described elsewhere (Gartner
          and Popovic, Techniques in HIV Research, Aldovini, A. and
          Walker, B., eds., Stockton Press, New York (1994) pp. 59-63).
          Mean EC50 values were determined from concentration-response
          curves from eight dilutions of Griffithsin (triplicate
          wells/concentration); assays for HIV-1 RF/CEM-SS employed
          XTT-tetrazolium; HIV-1 ROJO were tested in human PBMC cultures
          by supernatant reverse transcriptase activity; HIV-1 Ba-L and
          ADA were tested in human primary macrophage cultures by p24
          ELISA assay. Standard errors averaged less than 10% of the
          respective means. The results of this study are summarized in
          Table 1 below.<br>
          <br>

          <br>
          The results show that Griffithsin is potently active
          (sub-nanomolar EC50 values) against a broad range of HIV
          isolates including T-tropic viruses (utilizing CCR5 as a
          co-receptor) and M-tropic viruses (utilizing CXCR4 as a
          co-receptor). This picomolar level of activity is more potent
          than that described for most of the current anti-HIV agents
          utilized in therapy or in development, including the entry
          inhibitors cyanovirin-N and Enfurtide(R). The data also show
          that Griffithsin is effective at inhibiting infection by both
          laboratory-adapted strains and, more importantly, primary
          clinical isolates of HIV (e.g., ROJO, ADA, and Ba-L). Finally,
          the results indicate that Griffithsin is active regardless of
          the cell type used in the assay, having potent activity
          whether the cells were T-lymphocytes (CEM-SS), PBMCs, or
          macrophages. Griffithsin did not show any toxicity against any
          of the cell lines even at concentrations 1000-fold higher than
          the EC50 values.<br>

          <b>Example 8</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          This example describes the production of anti-Griffithsin
          polyclonal antibodies. A flow diagram illustrating a method of
          producing anti-Griffithsin antibodies is provided in FIG. 6.<br>
          <br>
          A New Zealand white rabbit was immunized with 100 [mu]g of
          Griffithsin in Freund's complete adjuvant. Booster injections
          of 50 [mu]g of Griffithsin in Freund's incomplete adjuvant
          were administered on days 13, 29, 51, 64, 100, and 195. On
          days 7, 21, 42, 63, 78, and 112, 10 mL of blood was removed
          from the rabbit. On day 112 the rabbit was sacrificed and bled
          out. The IgG fraction of the immune sera of the rabbit was
          isolated by protein-A Sepharose affinity chromatography
          (Bio-Rad, Hercules, Calif.) according to the manufacturer's
          instructions. Reactivity of the polyclonal antibodies for
          Griffithsin was demonstrated by immunoblot and ELISA studies
          with 1:500 to 1:3000 dilution of the rabbit immunoglobulin
          fractions.<br>
          <br>
          For immunoblotting, samples were transferred to PVDF membranes
          following SDS-PAGE according to standard procedures. The
          membranes were incubated for 1 hour with anti-Griffithsin
          polyclonal antibodies, washed three times with PBS containing
          0.05% Tween 20 (PBST), and then treated with goat anti-rabbit
          IgG antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Sigma,
          St. Louis, Mo.). After three washes with PBST, bound
          antibodies were visualized by incubating membranes in a
          solution of 0.05% 3,3'-diaminobenzidine and 0.003% H2O2.<br>
          <br>
          The IgG fraction of rabbit polyclonal anti-Griffithsin
          antibodies were purified after the final boost and animal
          sacrifice by using protein-A Sepharose chromatography on the
          57 mL of rabbit serum collected. Following purification, 78 mL
          of purified anti-Griffithsin IgGs were produced. The final
          concentration of protein was 335 micrograms/mL for a total
          yield of 27.3 mg of anti-Griffithsin IgG. To analyze the
          specificity of the resulting antibody preparation, Western
          blot analysis was performed and resulted in the clear
          determination of specificity and avidity for Griffithsin by
          the purified antibodies. A 1:250 dilution of the purified
          antibodies clearly visualized only the Griffithsin from a
          mixture of Griffithsin and other proteins. The response to
          Griffithsin by the anti-Griffithsin antibodies was also shown
          to be concentration-dependent.<br>

          </b><br>
          This example illustrates the anti-influenza virus activity of
          Griffithsin.<br>
          <br>
          All examined influenza viruses were passaged in Madin Darby
          canine kidney (MDCK) cells to prepare viral stocks. MDCK cells
          (from ATCC, Manassas, Va.) were grown in antibiotic-free
          minimum essential medium (MEM) with non-essential amino acids
          (Gibco, Long Island, N.Y.) containing 5% fetal bovine serum
          (FBS, HyClone Laboratories, Logan, Utah) and 0.1% NaHCO3. Test
          medium consisted of MEM with 0.18% NaHCO3, 10 units/mL
          trypsin, 1 [mu]g of ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA) per ml,
          and 50 [mu]g gentamicin/mL.<br>
          <br>
          Inhibition of virus-induced cytopathic effect (CPE) as
          determined by visual (microscopic) examination of infected
          cells and confirmed by increase in neutral red (NR) dye uptake
          into infected cells was used as an indicator of Griffithsin
          antiviral activity. The CPE inhibition method was reported
          previously by Smee et al. (Antiviral Res., 5: 251-259 (2001)).
          Seven concentrations of Griffithsin were screened for
          antiviral activity against each virus in 96-well flat-bottomed
          microplates of cells. The Griffithsin protein was added 5-10
          minutes prior to addition of virus to the cells. The
          concentration of virus correspond to approximately 50%
          infection of cells in culture (CCID50) per well. The virus
          challenge dose equals a multiplicity of infection of
          approximately 0.001 infectious particles per cell. The
          reaction proceeded at 37[deg.] C. for 72 hr. To perform the NR
          uptake assay for confirmation of antiviral activity, dye
          (0.34% concentration in medium) was added to the plates used
          to obtain visual scores of CPE. After 2 hours, color intensity
          of the dye absorbed by and subsequently eluted from the cells
          was determined by the method of Finter et al., J. Gen. Virol.,
          5, 419-427 (1969) using a computerized EL-309 microplate
          autoreader (Bio-Tek Instruments, Winooski, Vt.). Antiviral
          activity was expressed as the 50% effective (virus-inhibitory)
          concentration (EC50 value) determined by plotting Griffithsin
          concentration versus percent inhibition on semi-logarithmic
          graph paper. Cytotoxicity of compounds was assessed in
          parallel with the antiviral determinations in the same
          microplates, except in the absence of virus. From these, 50%
          cytotoxic endpoints (IC50 values) were determined. The results
          of this study are summarized in Table 2.<br>

          &nbsp;Similar to the results with HIV, Griffithsin was found
          to be potently active against a wide spectrum of influenza A
          viruses. These viruses included both H1N1 strains and H3N2
          strains of influenza, which is especially significant in light
          of the fact that the highly virulent Fijian strain of
          influenza A that afflicted the United States in 2003/2004 was
          also a H3N2 strain. Griffithsin was not found to be toxic to
          the MDCK cell line utilized for these experiments, even when
          the cells were exposed to a high dose of Griffithsin (10
          micrograms/mL).<br>
          <br>
          <b>Example 10</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          This example describes a method of producing recombinant
          Griffithsin.<br>
          <br>
          Recombinant expression of His-tagged Griffithsin in E. coli
          was optimized using a fermenter in combination with an
          auto-induction media. A seed culture was grown in LB media
          containing 30 [mu]g/ml kanamycin in a shaker flask at 37[deg.]
          C. and 150 rpm for 17 hours. In addition, a fermenter
          containing an auto-induction media was inoculated with the
          seed culture. The ratio of auto-induction media to seed
          culture was approximately 50:1. The culture was grown at
          37[deg.] C. for 24 hours. The final culture density was
          approximately 8.6 OD600 units. The final culture was harvested
          by centrifugation, and the soluble fraction was obtained as
          described above.<br>
          <br>
          Crude soluble fractions contained His-tagged-Griffithsin
          fusion protein, which was detected by Western-blotting with
          anti-Griffithsin polyclonal antibodies. The ratio of
          soluble:insoluble protein at approximately 15 kDa was 50:50.
          The ratio indicates that more Griffithsin protein was produced
          in soluble fraction in this fermentation procedure compared
          with protein expression achieved using a shaker flask
          procedure. In addition, the fermentation procedure provided
          approximately 30-fold higher quantities of Griffithsin protein
          than the shaker flask procedure. Approximately 50 mg of
          purified recombinant Griffithsin was isolated from 1 L of the
          fermentation. The purified protein existed as a homodimer and
          demonstrated gp120 binding and anti-viral activity equivalent
          to that of native Griffithsin.<br>
          <br>
          The results of this example confirm a method of producing
          recombinant, anti-viral Griffithsin protein.<br>
          <br>

          </b><br>
          This example demonstrates the anti-Hepatitis C(HCV) activity
          of Griffithsin.<br>
          <br>
          The anti-HCV activity of Griffithsin was analyzed as generally
          described in Krieger et al., J. Virol. 75: 4614-4624 (2001),
          but using the Huh7 ET (luc-ubi-neo/ET) cell line, which
          contains a new HCV RNA replicon with a stable luciferase (LUC)
          reporter. The HCV RNA replicon ET contains the 5' N-terminal
          repeat (IRES) of HCV (5') which drives the production of a
          firefly LUC, ubiquitin, and neomycin phosphotransferase (Neo)
          fusion protein. Ubiquitin cleavage releases the LUC and Neo
          genes. The encephalomycarditis virus (EMCV) IRES element
          controls the translation of the HCV structural proteins
          NS3-NS5. The NS3 protein cleaves the HCV polyprotein to
          release the mature NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B proteins
          that are required for HCV replication. At the 3' end of the
          replicon is the authentic 3' NTR of HCV. The LUC reporter is
          used as an indirect measure of HCV replication. The activity
          of the LUC reporter is directly proportional to HCV RNA levels
          and positive control antiviral compounds behave comparably
          using either LUC or RNA endpoints.<br>
          <br>
          The effect of a His-tagged Griffithsin (SEQ ID NO: 5) added in
          triplicate at a single high-test concentration of 20 [mu]M on
          HCV RNA-derived LUC activity and cytotoxicity was examined.
          Human IFN[alpha]-2b was included in each run as a positive
          control compound. Subconfluent cultures of the Huh7 ET cell
          line were plated out into 96-well plates that were dedicated
          for the analysis of cell numbers (cytotoxicity) or antiviral
          activity and, on the next day, Griffithsin or IFN[alpha]-2b
          was added to the appropriate wells. Cells were processed 72 hr
          later when the cells were still subconfluent. Compound
          cytotoxicity was assessed as the percent viable cells relative
          to the untreated cell controls.<br>
          <br>
          As shown in Table 3, the Griffithsin protein demonstrated 60%
          inhibition of viral replication, and an overall 25% reduction
          in cell growth.<br>

          The HCV RNA replicon confirmatory assay was then used to
          examine the effects of Griffithsin at different
          concentrations. Specifically, 0, 0.20, 0.63, 6.32, and 20
          [mu]g/ml Griffithsin was tested. Human IFN[alpha]-2b was
          included in each run as a positive control compound.
          Subconfluent cultures of the Huh7 ET cell line were plated out
          into 96-well plates that were dedicated for the analysis of
          cell numbers (cytotoxicity) or antiviral activity and, on the
          next day, each dose of Griffithsin was added to the
          appropriate wells. Cells were processed 72 hr later when the
          cells were still subconfluent. Compound EC50 and EC90 values
          (antiviral activity) were derived from HCV RNA levels assessed
          as either HCV RNA replicon-derived LUC activity or as HCV RNA
          using TaqMan RT-PCR. Compound IC50 and IC90 values
          (cytotoxicity) were calculated where applicable using
          CytoTox-1 (Promega), a colorimetric assay used as an indicator
          of cell numbers and cytotoxicity when the LUC assay system was
          employed, while ribosomal (rRNA) levels determined via TaqMan
          RT-PCR were used as an indication of cell numbers in the
          RNA-based assay. Compound selectivity indices SI50 and SI90
          values also were calculated from the spreadsheets.<br>
          <br>
          The results are presented in FIG. 7. As shown in FIG. 7,
          Griffithsin demonstrated anti-HCV activity in a dose-dependent
          manner. The EC50 of Griffithsin was 7.17 [mu]g/ml indicating
          substantial anti-viral potency. Griffithsin never reached a
          toxicity level, even at the highest test concentration of 10
          [mu]g/ml. Therefore, the IC50 and IC90 could not be
          determined.<br>
          <br>
          This example demonstrates that Griffithsin can be used to
          effectively inhibit HCV.<br>

          The medium from an 18 h monolayer (80-100% confluent) of
          Vero76 cells was drained and a His-tagged Griffithsin (SEQ ID

          added, followed within 15 min by the SARS virus or virus
          diluent. The plate of treated cells was sealed and incubated
          for the standard time period required to induce near-maximal
          viral CPE. The plate of cells was then stained with neutral
          red as described by Smee et al., Antimicrob. Agents Chemother.
          45: 743-748 (2001) and McManus, Appl. Environment. Microbiol.
          31: 35-38 (1976). Cells not damaged by virus took up a greater
          amount of dye. The percentage of neutral red uptake indicating
          viable cells was read on a microplate autoreader at dual
          wavelengths of 405 and 540 nm, with the difference taken to
          eliminate background. An approximated virus-inhibitory
          concentration at the 50% endpoint (EC50) and cell-inhibitory
          concentration at the 50% endpoint (IC50) was determined, and a
          general selectivity index was calculated from these values:
          SI=(IC50)/(EC50). The virus inhibitory EC50 and IC50 values
          and the SI values from the neutral red assay are provided in
          Table 4.<br>
          <br>
          The effect on reduction of virus yield was determined by
          assaying frozen and thawed eluates from each cup for virus
          titer using serial dilution onto monolayers of susceptible
          cells. The development of viral cytopathic effect (CPE) in
          these cells was an indication of the presence of infectious
          virus. The 90% virus-inhibitory effective concentration (EC90)
          of Griffithsin, which is the concentration of Griffithsin at
          which the virus yield was inhibited by 1 log 10, was
          determined from these data. The EC90 value from the virus
          yield assay is provided in Table 4.<br>
          <br>
          The visual appearance of treated infected cells was compared
          to that of treated uninfected cells. Specifically, changes
          such as enlargement, granularity, development of ragged edges,
          filmy appearance, rounding, and detachment from the surface of
          the well were detected by visual observation. Based on these
          observations, the cells were given a designation of T (100%
          toxic), PVH (partially toxic-very heavy-80%), PH (partially
          toxic-heavy-60%), P (partially toxic-40%), Ps (partially
          toxic-slight-20%), or 0 (no toxicity-0%) conforming to the
          degree of cytotoxicity visually present. A 50% virus
          inhibitory concentration (EC50) and 50% cell inhibitory
          (cytotoxic) concentration (IC50) was determined by regression
          analysis of these data. This assay was repeated to confirm the
          results. The EC50 and IC50 values and corresponding SI values
          obtained in the visual assay and the visual confirmation assay
          are provided in Table 4.<br>

          </b><br>
          As shown in Table 4, the Griffithsin protein inhibited the
          SARS virus with an average EC50 of 3 [mu]g/ml as determined by
          visual assay, and an EC90 of 5 [mu]g/ml as determined by virus
          yield assay indicating substantial antiviral potency. The EC50
          of 14 [mu]g/ml as determined by the neutral red assay provides
          a third measure of anti-viral activity for this protein. The
          IC50 of Griffithsin in each assay was greater than 100
          [mu]g/ml, indicating good cell viability at effective
          concentrations.<br>
          <br>
          This example demonstrates that Griffithsin can be used to
          effectively inhibit the SARS virus.<br>
          <br>

          This example demonstrates the anti-H5N1 activity of
          Griffithsin.<br>
          <br>
          Madin Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells, obtained from the
          American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, Va.), were grown
          in antibiotic-free minimum essential medium with non-essential
          amino acids (MEM) (Hyclone Labs, Logan, Utah) containing 5%
          fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 0.18% NaHCO3. The test medium was
          the above MEM without FBS, with added 10 units/ml trypsin
          (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.), 1 [mu]g of
          ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA) per ml, and 50 [mu]g
          gentamicin/ml. MDCK cells were used for the following cell
          culture antiviral studies.<br>
          <br>
          An influenza A (H5N1) hybrid virus was kindly provided by
          Medimmune, Inc. (Mountain View, Calif.). The virus consisted
          of the core (6 genes) of influenza A/Ann Arbor/6/60 with the
          H5 and Ni components from A/Vietnam/1203/2004. The virus was
          attenuated and was resistant to amantadine.<br>
          <br>
          Two methods were used to assay the antiviral activity of
          His-tagged Griffithsin (SEQ ID NO: 5) against the H5N1 virus
          in vitro: inhibition of virus-induced cytopathic effect (CPE)
          determined by visual (microscopic) examination of the cells,
          and increase in neutral red (NR) dye uptake into cells, as
          previously described in Smee et al., Antimicrob. Agents
          Chemother. 45: 743-748 (2001).<br>
          <br>
          In the CPE inhibition test, eight concentrations of
          Griffithsin or Ribavirin (a positive control; ICN
          Pharmaceuticals (Costa Mesa, Calif.)) was added to 96-well
          flat-bottomed microplates containing a cell monolayer. The
          compound was added 5-10 minutes prior to virus, which was used
          at a concentration of approximately 50% cell culture and 50%
          infectious doses (CCID50) per well. The viral dose equated to
          a multiplicity of infection of approximately 0.001 infectious
          particles per cell. The plate was sealed and incubated at
          37[deg.] C. The CPE values were read microscopically after 72
          h of incubation. Antiviral activity expressed as the 50%
          effective (virus-inhibitory) concentration (EC50) is provided
          in Table 5.<br>
          <br>
          The NR assay was performed as reported in Smee et al., supra.
          In the NR uptake assay, dye (0011% final concentration in
          medium) was added to the same set of plates used to obtain the
          visual scores. After 2 hours, color intensity of the dye
          absorbed by and subsequently eluted from the cells was
          determined spectrophotometrically. Antiviral activity was
          determined by plotting compound concentration against percent
          inhibition. The results expressed as the 50% effective
          (virus-inhibitory) concentration (EC50) are provided in Table
          5.<br>
          <br>
          Cytotoxicity of compounds was assessed in parallel with the
          above antiviral determinations using the same microplates in
          the absence of virus. After three days, the percent inhibition
          of cell proliferation was assessed by visual and neutral red
          assays as described above. From this data, 50% virus inhibitor
          concentration (EC50) and 50% cytotoxic endpoints (IC50) values
          were determined. Using both antiviral and cytotoxicity data,
          selectivity index values (IC50 divided by EC50) could be
          calculated for each set of data. These results are provided in
          Table 5.<br>

          As shown in Table 5, Griffithsin demonstrated potent anti-H5N1
          activity, exhibiting an EC50 of 0.65 [mu]g/ml, as determined
          by the visual assay, and an EC50 of 1.2 [mu]g/ml, as
          determined by the neutral red assay. The IC50 values
          demonstrate cytotoxic tolerance at effective concentrations.<br>
          <br>
          This example shows that Griffithsin can be used to effectively
          inhibit the anti-H5N1 virus.<br>
          <br>

          </b><b><br>
          </b><b>This example demonstrates the anti-ebola virus activity
            of Griffithsin.</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          Griffithsin is tested for anti-ebola virus activity by using
          the Zaire ebola virus engineered to express Green Fluorescence
          Protein (GFP), which is described in Towner et al., Virology.
          332(1):20-27 (2005).<br>
          <br>
          A His-tagged Griffithsin (SEQ ID NO: 5) or a positive control
          is added to a cell monolayer. Thereafter, the cells are
          challenged with the engineered Zaire ebola virus. Inhibition
          of ebola viral replication, and thus anti-viral activity, is
          detected on the basis of expression of GFP through means such
          as flow cytometry analysis. Griffithsin is found to have
          anti-ebola virus activity in the low [mu]g/ml range.<br>
          <br>
          The results indicated that Griffithsin can be used to
          effectively inhibit the ebola virus.<br>
