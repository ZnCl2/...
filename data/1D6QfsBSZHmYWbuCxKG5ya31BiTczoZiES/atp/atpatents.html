      &nbsp;<br>
      Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is a nucleotide, also called a
      nucleoside triphosphate, is a small molecule used in cells as a
      coenzyme. It is often referred to as the "molecular unit of
      currency" of intracellular energy transfer.[1]<br>
      <br>
      ATP transports chemical energy within cells for metabolism. Most
      cellular functions need energy in order to be carried out:
      synthesis of proteins, synthesis of membranes, movement of the
      cell, cellular division, transport of various solutes etc. The ATP
      is the molecule that carries energy to the place where the energy
      is needed. When ATP breaks into ADP (Adenosine diphosphate) and Pi
      (phosphate), the breakdown of the last covalent link of phosphate
      (a simple -PO4) liberates energy that is used in reactions where
      it is needed.<br>
      <br>
      It is one of the end products of photophosphorylation, aerobic
      respiration, and fermentation, and is used by enzymes and
      structural proteins in many cellular processes, including
      biosynthetic reactions, motility, and cell division.[2] One
      molecule of ATP contains adenine, ribose, and three phosphate
      groups, and it is produced by a wide variety of enzymes, including
      ATP synthase, from adenosine diphosphate (ADP) or adenosine
      monophosphate (AMP) and various phosphate group donors.
      Substrate-level phosphorylation, oxidative phosphorylation in
      cellular respiration, and photophosphorylation in photosynthesis
      are three major mechanisms of ATP biosynthesis.<br>
      <br>
      Metabolic processes that use ATP as an energy source convert it
      back into its precursors. ATP is therefore continuously recycled
      in organisms: the human body, which on average contains only 250
      grams (8.8 oz) of ATP,[3] turns over its own body weight
      equivalent in ATP each day.[4]<br>
      <br>
      ATP is used as a substrate in signal transduction pathways by
      kinases that phosphorylate proteins and lipids. It is also used by
      adenylate cyclase, which uses ATP to produce the second messenger
      molecule cyclic AMP. The ratio between ATP and AMP is used as a
      way for a cell to sense how much energy is available and control
      the metabolic pathways that produce and consume ATP.[5] Apart from
      its roles in signaling and energy metabolism, ATP is also
      incorporated into nucleic acids by polymerases in the process of
      transcription. ATP is the neurotransmitter believed to signal the
      sense of taste.[6]<br>
      <br>
      The structure of this molecule consists of a purine base (adenine)
      attached by the 9′ nitrogen atom to the 1′ carbon atom of a
      pentose sugar (ribose). Three phosphate groups are attached at the
      5′ carbon atom of the pentose sugar. It is the addition and
      removal of these phosphate groups that inter-convert ATP, ADP and
      AMP. When ATP is used in DNA synthesis, the ribose sugar is first
      converted to deoxyribose by ribonucleotide reductase.<br>
      <br>
      ATP was discovered in 1929 by Karl Lohmann,[7] and independently
      by Cyrus Fiske and Yellapragada Subbarow of Harvard Medical
      School,[8] but its correct structure was not determined until some
      years later. It was proposed to be the intermediary molecule
      between energy-yielding and energy-requiring reactions in cells by
      Fritz Albert Lipmann in 1941.[9] It was first artificially
      synthesized by Alexander Todd in 1948.[10]...<br>

        </div>

      <br>
      Adenosine is a chemical that is present in all human cells. It
      readily combines with phosphate to form various chemical compounds
      including adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and adenosine triphosphate
      (ATP). People use it for medicine.<br>
      <br>
      AMP is taken by mouth for treating shingles (herpes zoster
      infection) and a blood disorder called porphyria cutanea tarda.<br>
      <br>
      ATP is used under the tongue to increase physical energy. It is
      also given intravenously (by IV) for treating acute kidney
      failure, multiple organ failure, high blood pressure in
      lungarteries (pulmonary hypertension), cystic fibrosis, lung
      cancer, weight loss associated with cancer, and controlling blood
      pressure during anesthesia and surgery. It is also used for
      cardiac stress tests.<br>
      <br>
      Healthcare providers give adenosine intravenously for treating
      surgical pain and nerve pain, pulmonary hypertension, and certain
      types of irregular heartbeat. It is also given for controlling
      blood pressure during anesthesia and surgery and for heart tests
      called cardiac stress tests.<br>
      <br>
      Adenosine is injected into the space around the spinal cord to
      treat nerve pain.<br>
      <br>
      Adenosine phosphate is given by injection into the muscle
      (intramuscularly) for treating varicose veins, bursitis, pain and
      swollen tendons (tendonitis), itchiness, multiple sclerosis (MS),
      neuropathy, shingles (herpes zoster infection), cold sores and
      genital herpes (herpes simplex infections), and poor blood
      circulation.<br>
      <br>
      How does it work?<br>
      <br>
      Adenosine blocks faulty circuitry in the heart, which causes
      irregular heart rhythm. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) might prevent
      changes in energy metabolism that cause weight loss in people with
      advanced cancer.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Uses &amp; Effectiveness </b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      Effective for:<br>
      <br>
      Treating certain kinds of irregular heartbeat (as a
      prescription-only intravenous medicine).<br>
      <br>
      Possibly Effective for:<br>
      <br>
      Treating weight loss in people with advanced cancer. Intravenous
      ATP seems to improve appetite, food intake, and quality of life in
      people with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer and other tumors.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Wounds, usually in the legs, due to poor circulation (venous
      stasis ulcers). Intramuscular AMP might relieve fluid retention,
      itchiness, swelling and redness due to venous stasis ulcers.<br>
      <br>
      Insufficient Evidence for:<br>
      <br>
      Shingles (herpes zoster infection). Early research suggests that
      AMP given by injection into the muscle might be effective for
      treating herpes zoster (shingles) infection and for preventing
      nerve pain that follows these infections. Intramuscular AMP might
      also be effective for treating other kinds of herpes infections,
      according to limited research.<br>
      Lung cancer. Developing studies suggest that ATP is not effective
      for treating non-small-cell lung cancer.<br>
      Pain.<br>
      Other conditions.<br>
      More evidence is needed to rate the effectiveness of adenosine for
      these uses.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Side Effects &amp; Safety</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      Adenosine appears to be safe for most people when given by
      injection by qualified healthcare givers. It can cause breathing
      problems and chest pain, particularly when given at high doses.
      Headache, heart pounding, low blood pressure, nausea, sweating,
      flushing, lightheadedness, sleep problems, coughing, and anxiety
      can also occur.<br>
      Special Precautions &amp; Warnings:<br>
      Pregnancy and breast-feeding: Not enough is known about the use of
      adenosine during pregnancy and breast-feeding. Stay on the safe
      side and avoid use.<br>
      <br>
      Gout: ATP can raise the level of uric acid in the blood stream and
      in the urine, and this might trigger a case of gout. Gout causes
      red, hot, tender, swollen joints. The joint that is most often
      affected is at the base of the big toe.<br>
      <br>
      Heart disease: ATP can cause reduced blood flow to the heart and
      chest pain. It might worsen symptoms in patients with heart
      diseases such as chest pain and heart attack...<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b><b>Background</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Intracellular concentrations of adenosine-5’-triphosphate (ATP)
      are many times greater than extracellular concentrations (1–10 mM
      versus 10–100 nM, respectively) and cellular release of ATP is
      tightly controlled. Transient rises in extracellular ATP and its
      metabolite adenosine have important signaling roles; and acting
      through purinergic receptors, can increase blood flow and
      oxygenation of tissues; and act as neurotransmitters. Increased
      blood flow not only increases substrate availability but may also
      aid in recovery through removal of metabolic waste products
      allowing muscles to accomplish more work with less fatigue. The
      objective of the present study was to determine if supplemental
      ATP would improve muscle torque, power, work, or fatigue during
      repeated bouts of high intensity resistance exercise...<br>
      <br>
      <b>Results</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      No differences were detected in high peak torque, power, or total
      work with ATP supplementation; however, low peak torque in set 2
      was significantly improved (p &lt; 0.01). Additionally, in set 3,
      a trend was detected for less torque fatigue with ATP
      supplementation (p &lt; 0.10).<br>
      Conclusions<br>
      <br>
      Supplementation with 400 mg ATP/d for 15 days tended to reduce

      </b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b><b>Background</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Nutritional supplements designed to increase adenosine
      5′-triphosphate (ATP) concentrations are commonly used by athletes
      as ergogenic aids. ATP is the primary source of energy for the
      cells, and supplementation may enhance the ability to maintain
      high ATP turnover during high-intensity exercise. Oral ATP
      supplements have beneficial effects in some but not all studies
      examining physical performance. One of the remaining questions is
      whether orally administered ATP is bioavailable. We investigated
      whether acute supplementation with oral ATP administered as
      enteric-coated pellets led to increased concentrations of ATP or
      its metabolites in the circulation.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Results</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      ATP concentrations in blood did not increase after ATP
      supplementation via enteric-coated pellets or naso-duodenal tube.
      In contrast, concentrations of the final catabolic product of ATP,
      uric acid, were significantly increased compared to placebo by
      ~50% after administration via proximal-release pellets (P = 0.003)
      and naso-duodenal tube (P = 0.001), but not after administration
      via distal-release pellets.<br>
      Conclusions<br>
      <br>
      A single dose of orally administered ATP is not bioavailable, and
      this may explain why several studies did not find ergogenic
      effects of oral ATP supplementation. On the other hand, increases
      in uric acid after release of ATP in the proximal part of the
      small intestine suggest that ATP or one of its metabolites is
      absorbed and metabolized. Uric acid itself may have ergogenic
      effects, but this needs further study. Also, more studies are
      needed to determine whether chronic administration of ATP will
      enhance its oral bioavailability...<br>
      <br>
      <b>Background</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Nutritional supplements designed to increase adenosine
      5′-triphosphate (ATP) concentrations are commonly used by athletes
      as ergogenic aids. ATP is the primary source of energy for the
      cells, and supplementation may enhance the ability to maintain
      high ATP turnover during high-intensity exercise. ATP is also
      released from cells to act as a local regulator of
      neurotransmission, inflammation, and nociception via interaction
      with purinergic receptors [1,2]. ATP is present in substantial
      concentrations in a number of foods (e.g. meat, soy, mushrooms)
      [3] and in breast milk [4,5]. Furthermore, capsules containing ATP
      are currently registered in France for the treatment of low back
      pain of muscular origin, and supplements containing ATP are
      marketed on the internet for various purposes including the
      restoration of energy.<br>
      <br>
      Oral ATP supplements have beneficial effects in some but not all
      studies examining physical performance. In an experimental study
      by Jordan et al.[6], three groups of nine healthy men received ATP
      (150 or 225 mg) or placebo for 14 days. Physical performance and
      muscular strength were positively affected. Another study
      investigated the effects of supplementation with an ATP-containing
      registered drug for 30 days (Atépadène®, 90 mg daily) [7,8]. The
      questionnaire-based outcome indicated that it provided benefit to
      patients with subacute low back pain. In contrast to these
      beneficial findings, Herda et al. [9] found no improvements in
      muscle strength, power output, or endurance after supplementation
      of 24 healthy men with a commercially available treatment intended
      to increase ATP. The authors suggested that the lack of an effect
      in this double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial, might be
      caused by breakdown of ATP in the gastrointestinal tract. Because
      they did not collect blood samples from the participants, the
      authors could not verify whether ATP concentrations in the blood
      circulation had been altered as a result of supplementation [9].<br>
      <br>
      Evidence on the oral availability of ATP supplements is limited.
      In the study by Jordan et al. [6], no changes in whole blood and
      plasma ATP concentrations were detected, but the dosages
      administered were modest (225 mg or less). Animal studies
      reporting alterations in cardiac, vascular and pulmonary function
      after 30 days of oral ATP supplementation, also found no increases
      in systemic concentrations of plasma or erythrocyte ATP [10,11].
      However, the concentration of ATP in plasma taken from the portal
      vein of rats increased rapidly up to a 1000-fold after
      instillation of ATP in de small intestine [11]. The identification
      of a number of nucleoside transporters in the small intestine
      further suggested that orally administered ATP may be absorbed and
      utilized by the human body [12].<br>
      <br>
      We have previously shown that ATP is bioavailable after
      intravenous administration in humans [13]. ATP concentrations in
      erythrocytes increased in a dose-dependent manner by ~60% after
      24 h of continuous infusion. We now report the results of a
      randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial in 8 healthy
      humans, designed to assess the oral bioavailability of an ATP
      nutritional supplement. The ATP was administered as a single dose
      that was high enough to enable its detection in whole blood
      (5000 mg). Furthermore, an acid-resistant enteric coating of the
      multi-particulate supplement was used to prevent the degradation
      of ATP in the acidic environment of the stomach. As a comparison,
      ATP was also directly instilled in the small intestine via a
      naso-duodenal tube....<br>

      </b><b>Technical field</b><br>
      <br>
      The present invention belongs to the field of biochemical
      analysis, and more particularly to a novel cell adenosine
      triphosphate extraction device and method.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Background technique</b><br>
      <br>
      Microbiological testing is of great importance both in clinical
      testing and in industrial applications. At present, the detection
      of microbes mainly uses the traditional plate culture counting
      method, which takes a long time to cultivate the microorganisms
      under certain conditions, and then the plate count to obtain the
      concentration of microorganisms. The method steps cumbersome,
      time-consuming, often difficult to meet the requirements of the
      rapid detection of the scene. Adenosine triphosphate
      biofluorescence detection method has been developed in recent
      years, a new microbial detection method, it has a fast, accurate,
      sensitive and many other advantages.<br>
      <br>
      Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) as an important energy molecule
      exists in all organisms, by determining the amount of adenosine
      triphosphate under certain conditions, can indirectly infer the
      number or concentration of microorganisms. The adenosine
      triphosphate biofluorescence assay utilizes the complex
      biochemical reactions between adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and
      fluorescein-luciferase in the microbial cells to produce
      bioluminescence, and then the fluorescence intensity is measured
      by a fluorometer or a liquid scintillation tester. In the case
      where the external conditions such as fluorescein, luciferase,
      temperature, and pH are the same, the fluorescence intensity is
      proportional to the amount of adenosine triphosphate.<br>
      <br>
      Before performing the above-mentioned photo-light reaction to test
      the amount of adenosine triphosphate, it is first necessary to
      break the cell wall and the cell membrane to release adenosine
      triphosphate by certain physical and chemical means. At present,
      taking into account the factors conducive to the operation,
      usually the use of chemical means to release adenosine
      triphosphate. Commonly used chemical release agents, including,
      for example, surfactants, acids, bases, and even organic solvents.
      In addition to the release of the release of adenosine
      triphosphate in the release of the purpose, but also should have
      the following two effects: First, should be quickly passivated
      release process of the cell's own adenosine triphosphate protease
      (ATPase), reduce or eliminate its adenosine triphosphate Of the
      decomposition; the second is not the follow-up of light in the
      reaction of luciferase adverse effects. The above two requirements
      for the release of the liquid to meet the two opposite effects of
      the biological enzyme lead to the choice of the release fluid is
      difficult to complete, usually taking into account the two
      components after the compromise, thereby reducing the sensitivity
      of bioluminescence detection, No technology to completely avoid
      the above shortcomings.<br>
      <br>
      Physical means is another option for the extraction of adenosine
      triphosphate, such as mechanical extrusion, ultrasound, boiling,
      etc., but some of these shortcomings have led to its lack of
      access to widespread use, such as mechanical extrusion,
      ultrasound, etc., and can not make ATPase , It will hydrolyze the
      microbial adenosine triphosphate, affecting the detection
      sensitivity; although the heating method can make ATPase
      denaturation, extraction rate is high, but there are cumbersome,
      repeatability is not good, will produce steam effects of sample
      size and laboratory environment and other shortcomings. Therefore,
      it is very important to find a more convenient and effective
      method for the extraction of adenosine triphosphate with both
      ATPase inhibition and luciferase protection, which is important
      for the improvement and promotion of bioluminescence analysis.<br>
      <br>
      <b>The contents of the invention</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The object of the present invention is to provide an effective and
      simple extraction device for the problems existing in the physical
      and chemical release means of adenosine triphosphate in the
      presence of adenosine triphosphate biofluorescence detection. The
      device should have the advantages of easy to use, less sample
      consumption, good repeatability, and almost no steam spillover.<br>
      <br>
      In order to achieve the above object, the technical solution of
      the present invention is to provide a portable extraction device
      for adenosine triphosphate, which comprises a three-step adenosine
      triphosphate extractor, a heating system, and a temperature
      control system.<br>
      <br>
      Boiling is a good way to extract the microbial adenosine
      triphosphate, the extraction rate is high, and can be extracted
      with adenosine triphosphate at the same time, making ATPase
      denaturation, inhibition of adenosine triphosphate hydrolysis, but
      commonly used tube, beaker and other boiled containers (extractor)
      is usually used external contact heat transfer (Such as resistance
      wire furnace, etc.), it is difficult to precisely control the
      boiling time, resulting in a large change in extraction rate,
      sample test repeatability is poor; the same time, test tubes,
      beakers and other boiling containers for the open state, resulting
      in steam spill, the impact of extraction of adenosine triphosphate
      sample concentration The<br>
      In view of the above-mentioned drawbacks, the present invention
      adopts and combines the following three ways to precisely control
      the boiling time: 1) the use of infrared radiation heating, far
      infrared penetration is strong, in sufficient high radiant heat
      state, can achieve almost instantaneous boiling; (3) small sample
      pool (&lt;0.3mL capacity spherical container); 4) in the heating
      system outside the set of infrared reflection system to improve
      the effective utilization of infrared radiation heat. The above
      method allows the heat to reach and focus quickly on the sample
      position, so that the sample is almost instantaneous boiling, will
      be heated to boiling time is almost reduced to zero, reducing the
      calculation of boiling time error in order to improve the precise
      control of adenosine triphosphate extraction rate.<br>
      <br>
      In view of the shortcomings of the sample, the slender sample is
      the self-condensing system, and the additional condensing tube is
      not attached to ensure the sufficient condensation of the sample
      steam. And back to the sample cell, maintaining the sample
      uniformity of the volume and concentration of the contents. At the
      same time, in order to ensure the self-condensation effect, the
      heating system of the extraction device will only focus the
      heating position of the sample pool position, almost no heat from
      the self-condensation section.<br>
      <br>
      The above heating system and adenosine triphosphate extractor, in
      the sample microbial adenosine triphosphate accurate and rapid
      extraction at the same time, to ensure that the concentration of
      adenosine triphosphate concentration is consistent and repeat the
      sample.<br>

      <b>DESCRIPTION &nbsp;</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The present invention relates to an ATP extractant for extracting
      ATP (adenosine triphosphate) without destroying cells from
      microorganisms. [Related Art] In recent years, analytical
      instruments have been developed in which ATP is extracted from
      microorganisms and the amount of ATP is quantified from the amount
      of luminescence generated by the reaction with
      luciferin-luciferase to measure the number of microorganisms in a
      short period of time . Here, in order to measure low concentration
      of microorganisms, an ATP extracting agent that extracts
      microorganisms efficient efficiency &lt;ATP is required.
      Conventionally, surfactants such as ethylene oxide adducts of
      alkylphenols, ethylene oxide adducts of alkylamines, ethylene
      oxide adducts of quaternary ammonium salts and the like are known
      as ATP extractants for extracting ATP from microorganisms
      (Japanese Patent Publication No. 62 -4120). However, with the
      conventional ATP extractant, the amount of ATP to be extracted was
      small, so the detection limit of the number of microorganisms was
      about 10 '/ -. Therefore, when measuring the number of
      microorganisms of a system having a small number of microorganisms
      such as cooling water or white water of the pulp and paper
      industry, for example, there is a problem that the measurement
      method utilizing the ATP amount can not be applied in many cases.
      DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION Problems to be Solved by the Invention
      An object of the present invention is to solve the above problems,
      and it is an object of the present invention to provide a
      microorganism capable of measuring the number of microorganisms
      even in a system with a large extraction amount of ATP extracted
      from microorganisms and a small number of microorganisms In order
      to obtain an ATP extractant. [Means for Solving the Problem] The
      present invention is an ATP extracting agent comprising an
      alkylene oxide adduct of an alkylamine represented by the
      following general formula (1). (In the formula, R represents an
      alkyl group or alkenyl group having 8 to 22 carbon atoms, m, n, p
      and q are each 0 or a positive number, m + p = o to 20.n + q =
      1-20, m + n + p + q ≧ 2 The alkylene oxide adduct may be a block
      adduct or a random adduct, and in the case of a block adduct,
      either an ethylene oxide block or a propylene oxide block may be
      added to the alkylamine in advance. In the present invention, the
      alkylamine to which the alkylene oxide is added is represented by
      the following general formula (Il) RNH, ... (n) wherein R is as
      defined above. Specific examples thereof include octylamine,
      decylamine, dodecylamine, tetradecylamine, hexadecylamine,
      octadecylamine, eicosylamine, oleylamine and the like. The
      alkylene oxide added to such an alkylamine is propylene oxide,
      propylene oxide or ethylene oxide, but other alkylene oxides may
      be added together with these alkylene oxides, as represented by
      the above-mentioned general formula (1) , In the present
      invention, it is possible to use those obtained by adding both
      ethylene oxide and propylene oxide to alkylamine, or those to
      which propylene oxide is added singly, but it is preferable that
      both are added.<br>
      The addition form is not particularly limited and may be a random
      adduct randomly added with an alkylene oxide or a block adduct in
      which an alkylene oxide is continuously added blockwise. In the
      case of a block adduct, , Ethylene oxide may be added first or
      propylene oxide may be added first. In general formula (1), 1 m
      and p, or n and q may be the same or different from each other It
      is good. The alkylene oxide adduct of the alkylamine represented
      by the general formula (1) can be obtained by adding propylene
      oxide alone to the alkylamine represented by the general formula
      [1], or by adding propylene oxide and ethylene oxide randomly or
      arbitrarily In the following order. The ATP extractant of the
      present invention contains an alkylene oxide adduct of an
      alkylamine represented by the above general formula (I), and an
      alkylene oxide adduct of alkylamine may be used alone, or another
      component may be blended In any case, it can be dissolved in a
      solvent such as water to prepare a solution, which can be
      contacted with a microorganism to extract ATP. In the present
      invention, examples of microorganisms subject to ATP extraction
      include bacteria, filamentous fungi, basidiomycetes, yeasts,
      deformed bacteria. Algae, protozoans and the like. The ATP
      extractant of the present invention can extract ATP with a high
      extraction rate without destroying cells of microorganisms and
      does not inhibit the enzymatic activity of luciferase. Therefore,
      the ATP extractant of the present invention extracts ATP from a
      microorganism, reacts this ATP with luciferin-luciferase, measures
      the amount of luminescence generated, quantifies the amount of
      ATP, and measures the number of microorganisms from the amount It
      can be used for measuring the number of microorganisms. In order
      to measure the number of microorganisms using the ATP extracting
      agent of the present invention, the ATP extracting agent of the
      present invention is added to a solution containing a
      microorganism in an amount of 0.01 to 2% by weight of the compound
      represented by the general company (1) Add 0.05 to 0.3% by weight,
      bring it into contact for about 10 seconds to 2 minutes to extract
      ATP, add luciferin and luciferase, measure the amount of
      luminescence using a luminescence amount measuring instrument As
      shown in FIG. The system for measuring the number of
      microorganisms using the ATP extracting agent of the present
      invention is not particularly limited as long as it is a system
      containing microorganisms, and industrial products such as white
      water system, cooling water system, aqueous adhesives and the like
      in one pulp and paper mill, various fermentation Equipment,
      activated sludge apparatus and the like. When the ATP extracting
      agent of the present invention extracts ATP from the
      microorganisms in large amounts and the ATP extracting agent is
      used for measuring the number of microorganisms utilizing the
      amount of ATP, the amount of luminescence by the
      luciferin-luciferase reaction increases, and 104 A / - to the
      number of microorganisms.<br>
      <br>
      Therefore, even in a system with a small number of microorganisms
      to which this method could not be applied conventionally, the
      number of microorganisms can be measured using the amount of ATP.
      <br>
      <br>
      EFFECT OF THE INVENTION <br>
      <br>
      According to the present invention, since an alkylene oxide adduct
      of a specific alkylamine is used, an ATP extractant capable of
      extracting ATP from a microorganism with high extraction rate is
      obtained. Therefore, by using the ATP extractant of the present
      invention, it is possible to measure the number of microorganisms
      using ATPm even in a system with a small number of microorganisms
      which could not be applied to date. <br>

      Table 1. Table 1 14B: propylene oxide addition (block working

      Examples has a higher luminescence amount than the ATP extractant
      used in Comparative Example, and exhibits a good ATP extraction
      effect. Example 8, Comparative Example 5 Bacteria (Pseudos + onas
      sp,) separated from a cooling water system were cultured to obtain
      a culture solution with a bacterial count of 10 "4 g / -. This
      culture solution was centrifuged, and the separated bacteria were
      suspended in sterilized water, and further diluted with sterilized
      water to obtain a bacterial suspension having a predetermined
      concentration. 0.1 mM of this bacterial suspension and 0.1 - 0.4%
      by weight aqueous solution of the following ATP extractant were
      placed in a cuvette, and 30 seconds later, an enzyme solution
      containing luciferin-luciferase was added. After 10 seconds, the
      amount of luminescence was determined using the biocounter M2O10.

        <b>&nbsp;Process for Extracting Hydrophilic Substances</b></div>
      <br>
      A process for a hydrophilic substance, particularly adenosine
      triphosphate, from a material containing the hydrophilic substance
      bound or sequestered to a water-insoluble substance comprises
      preparing a mixture of the material with water and an organic
      liquid extractant, the water being partially soluble in the
      extractant and the extractant being present in an amount
      sufficient to dissolve part but not all of the water, whereby
      there are formed as separate phases an aqueous phase containing
      the dissolved hydrophilic substance and an organic liquid
      extractant phase, separating the phases and recovering the aqueous
      phase. The process is particularly applicable to hydrophilic
      substances found in living organisms, e.g. nucleotides,
      nucleosides, flavins or watersoluble cofactors. Specified
      extractants are 1-butanol, 2-butanol, t-butyl alcohol, n-amyl
      alcohol, t-amyl alcohol and 3-pentanol, anhydrous 1-butanol being
      preferred. Example describe the extraction of adenosine
      triphosphate from a culture of Escheriahia coli.<br>

      <b>Description</b><br>
      <br>
      We, E.I. Du PONT DE NEMOURS AND COMPANY, a corporation organised
      and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware, United
      States of America, of Wilmington, State of Delaware, United States
      of America, do hereby declare the invention, for which we pray
      that a patent may be granted to us, and the method by which it is
      to be performed, to be particularly described in and by the
      following statement:-<br>
      <br>
      This invention relates to a process for obtaining aqueous extracts
      of various hydrophilic substances from biological or nonbiological
      materials in a manner which also provides any desired
      concentrations of these extracted substances in the aqueous
      solutions obtained.<br>
      <br>
      A more specific aspect of this invention relates to a process for
      obtaining aqueous extracts and for concentrating aqueous solutions
      of biological hydrophilic substances, i.e. hydrophilic substances
      which can be found in living organisms, such as nucleotides (e.g.,
      adenosine triphosphate, hereinafter referred to as ATP),
      nucleosides, flavins, water-soluble vitamins, and watersoluble
      co-factors.<br>
      <br>
      Hydrophilic substances are frequently present in a material in
      combination with various water-insoluble substances. The
      water-insoluble substances may be linked to or sequester the
      hydrophilic substances so as to render them relatively
      inaccessible for aqueous extraction. For example, ATP is present
      in biological cells in which membrane and other material prevent
      its quantitative extraction by water alone.<br>
      <br>
      ATP is a nucleotide which is present in all living organisms. By
      determining whether there is ATP present in a certain environment.
      it is possible to detect the existence of living organisms in that
      environment. Thus by monitoring for the presence of ATP, the
      existence of microorganisms may be determined. This determination
      is useful in the detection of biological warfare agents; in the
      determination of background levels of microorganisms in the
      environment such as air, water, food, clean assembly areas,
      hospital rooms and germ free areas, and the detection of any
      increased contamination in any of these enviroments; and in
      monitoring the effectiveness of sterilization procedures and the
      sterilization of compounds and apparatus. Further, the
      determination of ATP is useful for the study of cell aggregates,
      for example tissues of higher animals.<br>
      <br>
      One method for determining the presence of ATP is by means of the
      phenomenon of firefly bioluminescence-i.e. by the reaction of ATP
      with firefly lantern extract. In practicing this method, a sample
      of the environment to be tested or assayed for living organisms,
      such as an aqueous extract of the material which is suspected to
      contain living organisms, is mixed in the presence of oxygen with
      firefly lantern extract. If a biological material is present in
      the sample, this fact will be indicated by the emission of light.
      The amount of bioluminescent light which is emitted is directly
      proportional to the amount of ATP present in the material being
      tested. However, since the ATP is, to some extent, sequestered by
      or linked to other substances, the total ATP is not available
      quantitatively in an extracellular free state for reaction in the
      firefly bioluminescent assay.<br>
      <br>
      In testing for the presence of biological material, since the
      amount of bioluminescent light which is emitted is directly
      proportional to the amount of intracellular ATP in the material
      tested, it is desirable to bring about as high a degree of release
      of the ATP contained within the material suspected of&nbsp;
      containing biological material as possible.<br>
      <br>
      ATP is the primary energy donor for all metabolic processes and is
      also useful, in and of itself, in biochemical research, in
      inhibitS ing enzymatic browning of potatoes and as a
      pharmacological agent. However, the extraction of ATP from
      biological material is difficult.<br>
      <br>
      One method by which ATP has been extracted from biological
      material is disclosed in U.S. Patent 2,472,130. This method
      involves treating finely comminuted cells with a water-soluble
      agent such as ethyl alcohol, discarding the alcohol and
      subsequently extracting the ATP from the residual cell material
      into water. However, this procedure is inconvenient since it must
      be performed in a plurality of separate steps and, moreover, since
      it does not provide a convenient means for concentrating ATP in
      the aqueous phase.<br>
      <br>
      According to the invention a process is provided for extracting a
      hydrophilic substance from a material containing the hydrophilic
      substance bound or sequested to a water-insoluble substance. The
      process comprises preparing a mixture of a material containing the
      hydrophilic substance, water and an organic liquid extractant
      which will liberate the hydrophilic substance from the material in
      which it is contained. The water in the admixture may be initially
      present (e.g., when the material containing the hydrophilic
      substance is in the form of an aqueous preparation), or the water
      may be added at the time the admixture is prepared. The organic
      liquid extractant is chosen so that a portion of the water in the
      admixture will be dissolved in the extractant. The extractant is
      used in an amount sufficient to dissolve part but not all of the
      water. There is thereby formed a separate aqueous phase in a
      quantity less than that originally present in the admixture. This
      aqueous phase contains dissolved therein the hydrophilic material
      which has been released from the substance in which it was
      originally contained. The aqueous phase may then be separated from
      the organic liquid phase and recovered. The aqueous phase may be
      used as such (e.g., aqueous extracts of ATP may be assayed as
      hereinafter described) or the hydrophilic material may be
      recovered therefrom, such as by evaporation of the water.<br>
      <br>
      The practice of this invention may be used to extract
      water-soluble, hydrophilic substances from a material containing
      the same using an appropriate organic liquid extractant which is
      not completely miscible with water and which will act to liberate
      the hydrophilic substance from the material.<br>
      <br>
      Such organic liquid extractants include compounds such as ketones,
      alcohols, aldehydes, esters, nitroparaffins, phenols or
      derivatives of any of such compounds which are substituted with
      groups or atoms such as fluorine, 1 chlorine or phenyl. In a
      preferred embodiment of this invention, the process is employed to
      extract biological hydrophilic substances (hydrophilic substances
      found in living organisms), such as neucleotides, nucleosides,
      flavins, water-soluble vitamins or watersoluble cofactors, from
      materials containing such substances. We use the term "favin"
      herein to mean isoalloxazine, quercetin or one of a group of
      yellow plant pigments such as lacto flavins, lumi flavins, protein
      flavins, purine flavins and carbohydrate flavins.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, by the practice of this invention, aqueous extracts of the
      following may be obtained: low molecular weight organic compounds
      such as acetic acid from petroleum using an ester such as ethyl
      acetate as the liquid extractant; water-soluble pesticides such as
      2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid from soil using a nitroparaffin
      such as nitroethane; inorganic compounds such as sodium iodide
      from dimethylsulfoxide using an alcohol such as 1-butanol;
      nucleotides such as ATP from tissue cells using 1-butanol;
      nucleosides such as adenosine from reaction products resulting
      from the synthesis of the same, using an aldehyde such as
      butyraldehyde as the extractant; flavins such as riboflavin from
      spinach using an alcohol such as 5-fluoro-l-pentanol;
      water-soluble vitamins such as ascorbic acid from citrus using
      phenol; and water-soluble cofactors such as coenzyme R from egg
      yolk using a ketone such as 3-pentanone.<br>
      <br>
      This invention will be further described with specific reference
      to the extraction of ATP from a biological material although it is
      to be understood that the invention is not restricted thereto.<br>
      <br>
      The biological material from which ATP may be extracted and
      concentrated may be obtained from tissues taken from a living or
      recently living animal, from a bacterial or viral culture,
      suspensions of microorganisms, blood, urine, water or beverages
      suspected of contamination, tissue cells, patient exudates, air
      suspected of containing microorganisms, food or other contaminated
      environments.<br>
      <br>
      Organic liquids which may be used as extractants include, for
      example, monohydric alcohols containing from four to seven carbon
      atoms. These are well known compounds and include 1-butanol,
      2-butanol, tbutyl alcohol, n-amyl alcohol, t-amyl alcohol, and
      3-pentanol. Anhydrous 1-butanol is the preferred alcohol and is
      advantageously used in an amount sufficient to give a water:
      alcohol ratio of from 1 1 to 1:5.<br>
      <br>
      The method of preparing the admixture of sample material
      containing (or suspected to contain) biological material, the
      alcohol and water is not critical. Thus, the sample material may
      be added to a mixture of the alcohol and water or it may be added
      first to one of these components and then the other component
      added. It is generally preferred that an aqueous suspension of the
      sample material first be prepared and that the alcohol be added to
      this suspension.<br>
      <br>
      Where the number of cells per test volume of the sample and,
      consequently the amount of ATP, is below the limit of
      detectability, a preferred method of operation is to filter an
      adequate volume of an aqueous suspension of the cells through a
      suitable filter, such as a membrane filter of the submicron size.<br>
      <br>
      The filter, together with the material retained on it, is then
      placed into an appropriate container to which an appropriate
      quantity of the organic liquid extractant is added. The mixture is
      shaken and then allowed to stand for from one to several minutes.
      Sufficient water is then added and mixed with the organic liquid
      to saturate the latter and create the desired volume of aqueous
      phase.<br>
      <br>
      The mixture may then be centrifuged if further phase separation is
      desired. The ATP will now be in the aqueous phase. Aliquots of the
      aqueous phase can be removed by syringe or other means and used
      for assay in the firefly bioluminescent reaction. Thus, the cells
      contained in relatively large volumes of suspension can be
      collected, extracted, and the ATP concentrated for assay.<br>
      <br>
      The relative amounts of organic liquid extractant and water used
      in the practice of this invention are important. Sufficient
      organic liquid is used to bring about the release of the ATP
      contained in the cells and sufficient water is used to provide the
      separate aqueous phase in which is carried the ATP released from
      the cells. The amount of organic liquid must be sufficient to
      dissolve part, but not all, of the water. If it is desired to
      obtain more concentrated solutions of ATP, lesser amounts of water
      and greater amounts of organic liquid may be used, provided that
      sufficient water remains undissolved in the organic liquid so as
      to provide the separate aqueous phase.<br>
      <br>
      The organic liquid extractant in the admixture apparently
      dissolves lipids or other materials in the cell membranes, thereby
      making them permeable to the ATP contained in the cells. The ATP
      is then extracted almost completely into the aqueous phase.
      Moreover, the organic liquid reduces the volume of the aqueous
      phase by dissolving a portion of the water but not the ATP. Thus,
      by appropriate adjustment of the amount of organic liouid used,
      the desired concentration of ATP in the aqueous phase can be
      achieved.<br>
      <br>
      The separation of the aqueous phase from the organic liquid phase
      occurs when the admixture is allowed to stand for a short period
      of time. However, if it is desired to speed up the separation,
      this may be accomplished by centrifuging the admixture.<br>
      <br>
      By the practice of this invention, the ATP content of biological
      material may be recovered substantially quantitatively so that it
      is available for participation in the lightproducing response of
      the firefly bioluminescent reaction. This invention also provides
      a mechanism for concentrating the ATP to increase the sensitivity
      of the overall assay method.<br>
      <br>
      The aqueous extract may be assayed by means of the firefly
      bioluminescent technique by contacting an aliquot of the extract
      in the presence of oxygen with firefly lantern extract, which
      extract contains luciferin, luciferase and magnesium, and
      monitoring for the emission of light. The aqueous reaction medium
      will generally contain enough oxygen to allow the bioluminescent
      reaction to take place. The amount of light emitted may be
      measured to determine the amount of ATP present. This provides a
      measure of the number of cells present.<br>
      <br>
      The firefly bioluminescent reaction may be carried out utilizing
      crude firefly lantern extracts or the purified constituents
      therefrom which participate in the bioluminescent reaction. A
      sufficiently high degree of sensitivity may be attained using the
      primary extract of the firefly lantern. Lyophilized firefly
      lantern extract may be obtained commercially. This material may be
      prepared for use by dissolving it in distilled, deionized water to
      the desired concentrations. The extracts used in the examples
      which follow, are obtained by dissolving 70 mg. of lyophilized
      firefly lantern extract in 5 ml. of water. The lyophilized
      preparation also contains MgSO4 and potassium arsenate in amounts
      sufficient to result in concentrations of 0.OlM and O.05M,
      respectively. The pH of such a solution is 7.4. The solutions may
      be further diluted to give any desired concentration of firefly
      lantern extract. The firefly lantern extract which may b_ used may
      also be prepared in the laboratory from dessicated firefly tails.
      The firefly tails are first ground to a fine powder with a mortar
      and pestle with a small amount of washed silica. The powder is
      then extracted with 0.05M potassium arsenate-0.O1M MgSO4 at pH
      7.4.<br>
      <br>
      In order to observe and record small amounts of light produced by
      a positive response between the material to be assayed and the
      firefly lantern extract and to make quantitative measurements of
      the amount of light emitted, instruments which will sense and
      record the intensity of the emitted light may be used. In order to
      detect and record the intensity of emitted light, one procedure
      consists of injecting the aqueous extract prepared in accordance
      with the practice of this invention into a cuvette containing the
      firefly lantern extract. The extract is held at pH 7.4 with
      potassium arsenate buffer. The light emitted as the result of the
      reaction between any ATP in the aqueous extract and the firefly
      lantern extract strikes the photosensitive surface of a
      photomultiplier tube giving rise to an electric potential which
      can be measured and recorded by either an oscilloscope photograph
      or a chart recorder.<br>
      <br>
      A convenient unit for measuring the response produced by the
      intrument is the millivolt.<br>
      <br>
      Because the response (i.e., light emission) is almost
      instantaneous when the aqueous extract contaiinng ATP is contacted
      with the firefly lantern extract, the firefly lantern extract
      should be positioned in front of the light detection system prior
      to the introduction of the material to be assayed. The
      bioluminescent response with ATP is determined by measuring the
      maximum intensity of the emitted light, which after reaching this
      maximum value, decays logarithmically. With all -other factors
      constant, the maximum intensity is directly proportional to the
      concentration of ATP.<br>
      <br>
      The instrumentation necessary for the quantitative measurement of
      bioluminescence consists of a photomultiplier tube for the
      conversion of light energy into an electrical signal, a device for
      determining the magnitude of the signal, and a light-tight chamber
      for presentation of the bioluminescent reaction to the
      photomultiplier tube.<br>
      <br>
      In one system, part of the assembly consists of a composite
      sensing and reaction chamber which contains a photomultiplier
      tube, with appropriate circuitry, and a rotary cylinder mounted in
      a block of aluminum in a manner which permits removal of the
      reaction chamber without exposing the phototube to light. A
      section of the cylinder wall is cut out to accommodate a standard
      rectangular cuvette. Immediately above the cuvette holder is a
      small injection port sealed with a replaceable light-tight rubber
      plug. The entire unit is painted black to reduce light reflection.
      The photomultiplier converts the light energy into an electrical
      signal. An oscilloscope, which records the magnitude of the signal
      from the photomultiplier, is provided with an adjustable vertical
      deflection scale which will allow an adjustment in system
      sensitivity. There is a multiple switching arrangement at the
      oscilloscope input which makes it convenient to adjust the system
      zeros and balances. The differential input to the oscilloscope
      provides a means to balance the dark current output of the
      phototube. The response to the firefly luminescent system
      displayed on the oscilloscope screen is recorded with a camera
      which mounts directly onto the front of the oscilloscope. To
      observe and record the reaction, the cuvette containing the
      necessary reagents is positioned in the cuvette - carrier without
      exposing the phototube. Rotation of the carrier positions the
      cuvette in front of the phototube. The extract presumed to contain
      ATP is then added through the injection port and the magnitude of
      the response, if any, is recorded by the camera. The procedure for
      assaying aqueous extracts prepared according to the practice of
      this invention utilizing electronic apparatus to detect and record
      the intensity of the bioluminescent reaction, which procedure is
      employed in the examples, is described below:<br>
      <br>
      One tenth ml. of a 0.5% buffered aqueous solution of commercially
      available lyophilized firefly lantern extract is placed into a
      cuvette which is then positioned in a light detection chamber. The
      extract contains luciferase, luciferin and magnesium. Sufficient
      dissolved oxygen for the bioluminescent reaction is present in the
      solution. Ten microliters of the aqueous extract to be assayed are
      then drawn into a hypodermic syringe and immediately injected
      through the light-proof seal into the cuvette. The reaction
      reaches maximum light intensity in less than one second and then
      decreases logarithmically for several minutes. The entire
      procedure can be executed and the response through its maximum
      amplitude recorded in less than 2 minutes.<br>
      <br>
      In order to make quantitative determinations of the amount of ATP
      present, the instrument used to measure the light response may be
      calibrated using known concentrations of ATP. A calibration may be
      plotted by injecting 1/100 ml. portions of known concentrations of
      ATP through the lightproof seal into the cuvette by means of a
      hypodermic syringe. The light response in millivolts is plotted
      against the ATP concentration. A straight linear function is
      obtained. For example, if the response from 10-1 gamma of ATP is
      20,000 millivolts, and that from 10-2 is 2,000 millivolts.<br>
      <br>
      In order that the invention will be fully understood, the
      following Examples are 110 given by way of illustration only.<br>

      the first time in the animal kingdom, Enzyme activity which is
      also suitable for food supplements, for organ targeting or also as
      a catalyst in the production of phosphorylated products.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Background of the invention.</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The basic principle of anti-infective therapy, which is
      acknowledged as the state of knowledge, is the principle of
      selective toxicity of anti-infectives established by Paul Ehrlich:
      when micro-organisms, such as Gram-positive or Gram-negative
      bacteria, are specifically stained, as Robert Koch had shown ,
      There should also be substances which inhibit or kill
      microorganisms in growth without the host organism, (Eg, humans,
      plants or animals) (cf. Mutschler, E. et al. "Drug Effects" 2001,
      B. Auflage, WVG, Stuttgart).<br>
      <br>
      [1] Based on this, the selective toxicity of the anti-infectives
      currently used therapeutically is based on the attack on
      structures which are not present in the host organism or at least
      in a substantially different form than in the pathogenic
      pathogens. There are currently four basic mechanisms for the
      action of anti-infectives: 1. Inhibition of cell wall synthesis,
      Eg by beta-lactam antibiotics, glycopeptides, fosfomycin, 2.
      Disturbance of the permeability of the cytoplasmic membrane, eg.
      For example by polypeptide antibiotics, polyene antibiotics, 3.
      Blockade of protein biosynthesis, For example by aminoglycosides,
      tetracyclines, chloramphenicol, macrolides, lincosamides, 4.
      Inhibition of nucleic acid synthesis, Eg by rifampicin,
      sulfonamides, gyrase inhibitors, flucytosine, antiviral polymerase
      inhibitors. 1. Inhibition of cell wall synthesis, Eg by
      beta-lactam antibiotics, glycopeptides, fosfomycin, 2. Disturbance
      of the permeability of the cytoplasmic membrane, For example by
      polypeptide antibiotics, polyene antibiotics, 3.<br>

      <br>
      The field of action of the modern anti-infectives extends to
      bacterial infections, mycoses, protozoa and diseases.<br>
      <br>
      A serious drawback of the present selective toxic therapy with
      anti-infectives is the great problem that in the course of the
      therapy of the disease exciter adaptations to the selective
      principle of action, which lead to resistances against the
      anti-infektivum. Many antibiotics have already become ineffective
      in the course of the years of their application, since resistant
      germs have formed during the therapy cycles.<br>
      <br>
      Therefore, new anti-infectives with new as possible mechanisms of
      action are required, especially those with a low risk of
      resistance formation. Such new principles are also being studied,
      especially in marine ecosystems, especially in organisms that live
      like sea squids in symbiotic communities with fungi, algae and
      microorganisms. This is therefore promising as effective
      mechanisms of exchange-based growth control and controlled
      survival have evolved over the course of evolution. This is
      usually done by low molecular weight secondary metabolites.<br>
      <br>
      Summaries can be found in various reviews, B. Krebs, H.Chr. Recent
      Developments in the Field of Marine Natural Products with Emphasis
      on Biologically Active Compounds, 1986, Progress in the Chemistry
      of Organic Natura) Products 49, 151-363, or Sarma, A. S. et al.
      Edit. Secondary Metabolites from Marine Sponges, 1993, Ulstein
      Mosby, Berlin.<br>
      As can be seen from this, marine sea swamps form numerous
      secondary low molecular weight metabolites with some new complex
      lead structures which are difficult to access by classical
      chemical methods.<br>
      <br>
      The () describes isolable chemical compounds of the group of
      substituted azepines, which are known as protein kinase C, from
      various sponges such as Phakellia flabellate (Great Barrier Reef,
      Australia), Hymeniaeiidon aldis (Okinawa), Axinella verrucosa
      (Mediterranean) and Acan thella aurantiaca (Red Sea) Inhibitors
      have in particular anti-viral and anti-tumor properties. Such an
      effect is based on the kinase-specific activity of the energy
      supply of the cells by the elimination of phosphate from the
      adenosine triphosphate (ATP). If this cleavage - The known ATPase
      reaction - Is inhibited by appropriate inhibitors as mentioned
      above, an interruption of the signal transfer in the cell occurs.<br>
      After the (), discodermolide compounds (terpene lactones) from
      Discodermia disoluta are described which are used to modify the
      immune system and inhibit tumor growth. The substances are
      recovered analogously as above by extraction with methanol /
      toluene, distillation between water / ethyl acetate and
      chromatography of the acetone phase.<br>
      In the (), spongistatins are lactones) (2,3,5,7,8,9) by isolation
      from Spongiidae, Demospongidae (2,3) and Spirastrella spirulifera
      by extraction with an organic solvent such as alcohol, methylene
      chloride, toluene, distributing the organic phase between water /
      organic solvent and chromatographic purification of the organic
      phase. The substances are said to show antitumor activity.<br>
      <br>
      The above-described methods are distinguished by the fact that
      certain chemical substances of the group of azepines, lactones
      from the mentioned marine organisms are isolated with organic
      solvents and chromatographic methods and these are then used as
      pharmaceutical active ingredients. Several cleaning methods have
      to be used. The isolated compounds act via the known inhibition of
      the phosphate cleavage (ATPase reaction) and the interruption of
      the energy supply of the cell caused thereby. However, this
      mechanism is not specific, as can cells which are not to be
      switched off from the power supply, such as, for example, B. Host
      cells in infections or benign cells in tumor diseases.<br>
      It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a
      pharmaceutical, cosmetic, or even a food or supplementary agent or
      biochemical reagent with the aid of a simple method with which the
      supply of the cell is changed efficiently and specifically, in
      particular the energy supply of, Eg by infection or tumor growth,
      can be interrupted without the metabolic processes of the host /
      the healthy cell being substantially impaired or, on the other
      hand, with an effective dietary supplementation in patients, Eg
      with pathogenically colonized intestinal flora.<br>
      <br>
      This object is achieved according to the invention by the fact
      that in particular sponges of the classes of Hyalospongiae,
      Demospongiae, Hadromeridae, Peociloscleridae, Haploscleridae,
      Spongiidae, Clionidae, Axinellidae, Raspailiidae, Esperiopsidae,
      Halichondriidae, Mycaliidae, Myxillidae (such as, For example,
      described in Rupert Riedel, Fauna and Flora of the Mediterranean
      Sea, Verlag Paul Parey 1983), and without isolation of individual
      compounds, the collected product as such can be processed into
      pharmaceutically / cosmetically acceptable agents, food
      supplements, biochemical reagents.<br>
      <br>
      Surprisingly, it has been found that products which, in contrast
      to the substances described so far, have an extremely active novel
      ATP-cleaving enzymatic activity, are obtained here, see Examples 1
      and 2.<br>
      <br>
      The incubation of aqueous or, For example aqueous alcoholic
      preparations of sponges or Sponge homogenates catalyze the
      cleavage of the ATP substrate directly into adenine without any
      dephosphorylation step. The incubation also provides directly
      D-ribose 5-triphosphate, which has never been described as a
      metabolic ATP product, see also Table 1.<br>
      Accordingly, the method according to the invention provides a
      composition whose novel effect is based on the previously unknown
      catabolic metabolic pathway for ATP which is present in sponges.
      This activity can be attributed to an enzyme (protein) that
      catalyzes the hydrolysis of the N-glycosidic binding of ATP. ATP
      N-glycosidase can be mentioned in this respect, and the products
      according to the invention thus have an ATP N-glycosidase-
      Activity.<br>
      <br>
      Although various enzymes are known to cleave the N-glycosidic bond
      between adenine and ribose, it has not yet been shown to decompose
      ATP in its most energetic form directly into adenine and D-ribose
      tri-phosphate.<br>
      <br>
      According to the present invention, an enzyme which has hitherto
      been unknown in the animal kingdom has been found for the first
      time in a readily available product, Activity attributable to the
      presence of an ATP N-glycosidase found in the lowest animal cell
      organisms, sea floes. Surprisingly, it has been found that the
      enzymatic activity is such that N-glycosidic bonds of adenosine
      nucleotide in its most energetic form (ATP), which is the most
      widespread and ubiquitous adenine-containing cell component, are
      cleaved.<br>
      ATP plays a role as a transmitter in cell-cell communication, in
      humans, among other things. In the central nervous system and in
      the area of ​​the smooth or transverse muscle (see Fig.
      Mutschler).<br>
      <br>
      On the other hand, ATP provides the body with the energy required
      for life. The surprisingly found new enzymatic activity-
      Completely in contrast to the known ATPase activity, which
      gradually provides the metabolism energy to the cell by
      elimination of phosphate residues, All ATP-energy-dependent
      metabolic processes of the cells can be selectively solved with
      very high enzymatic activity within a very short time.<br>
