      This book is a visually compelling journey through the unique
      geometric discoveries of Frank Chester, a contemporary sacred
      geometer, artist, and sculptor. This art-style book with highly
      polished design elements leads the reader from discovery to
      discovery, complemented by original text from the author, a PhD
      who has studied Frank's work from its inception, when it was just
      seven sticks in a ball of mud on the banks of the American
      River... From the back cover: The ancient tradition of Sacred
      Geometry is still alive and well in the person of Frank Chester.
      He has discovered a new geometric form that unites the five
      Platonic solids and provides some startling indications about the
      form and function of the human heart. This new form, called the
      Chestahedron, was discovered in 2000, and is a seven-sided
      polyhedron with surfaces of equal area. Frank has been exploring
      the form and its significance for over a decade. His work has
      potential implications across a number of areas, from physiology
      to architecture, sculpture, geology, and beyond. Inspired by the
      work of Rudolf Steiner, Frank sees a deep connection between form
      and spirit. This book gives a brief, highly visual overview of
      some of Frank's discoveries, and presents a compelling series of
      indications for future research. <br>

      <b>Abstract</b><br>
      Blade systems mix fluids and/or air to create and organize unique
      vortexes. The vortexes periodically implode to provide superior
      mixing. The blade structures may comprise four fold lines upon a
      circular planar surface. The planar surface may be prepared by
      removal of just one small portion of material, the removed portion
      spanning approximately one radian of the perimeter.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0003] The present invention overcomes shortfalls in the related
      art by presenting an unobvious and unique combination and
      configuration of mixing blade geometry resulting in superior fluid
      dynamics. Disclosed embodiments of the invention include efficient
      patterns placed upon flat sheets of material whereby little
      material is wasted and few folds are made in the construction of
      mixing blades. In one embodiment, three symmetrical blades are
      attached together to form a mixing blade system. The disclosed
      geometry allows for secure attachment of mixing blades by joining
      select surfaces of identical angles and surface areas that also
      form surfaces useful for mixing, vortex organization and vortex
      implosions.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] In one embodiment, three of the disclosed blades are
      identical and are attached in an equilateral triangle formation at
      an approximate angle of 26 degrees from a vertical reference
      center line projection. A disclosed blade efficiently comprises
      four fold lines upon a circular planar surface and the removal is
      just one a small portion of material, the removed portion spanning
      approximately one radian of the perimeter.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] These and other objects and advantages will be made
      apparent when considering the following detailed specification
      when taken in conjunction with the drawings.<br>

      <br>
      [0059] Referring to FIG. 1, a side perspective view of a disclosed
      mixer system is shown with a mixing shaft 300 superior to the
      blades. The mixing shaft 300 is sometimes aligned to the center
      reference point shown or axis in FIG. 9 as “A”. Referring back to
      FIG. 1, a mixing blade 100 in general may be comprised of a main
      flat base section 110 , an outer flap section 115 , a middle flap
      section 120 , an inner flap section 125 and a connection flap 130
      .<br>
      <br>
      [0060] FIG. 2 depicts a disclosed system that may comprise a
      plurality of blades.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] FIG. 3 presents a top plan view of a three blade embodiment
      with each blade attached to a shaft 300 .<br>
      <br>
      [0062] FIG. 4 depicts an elevation view of a disclosed system.
      FIG. 4 further depicts a blade comprising a main flat base section
      110 , an outer flap section 115 , a middle flap section 120 , an
      inner flap section 125 and a connection flap 130 .<br>
      <br>
      [0063] FIG. 5 depicts a rotated view of FIG. 4 and depicts a back
      side of an outer flap 115 and other blade components.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] FIG. 6 is a plan view of a disclosed blade 100 and
      discloses construction of a blade by use of various angles,
      reference lines and reference points. While certain angles are
      disclosed as the best mode, other angles are contemplated.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] FIG. 6 discloses projection lines, angels of construction
      for fold lines and angles of fold. The terms “reward” and
      “forward” are not limiting, but are used in reference to one
      disclosed embodiment shown in FIG. 6 wherein the view of FIG. 6
      has been arbitrarily considered to be a front view with A′ on the
      bottom and A on the top. Other configurations are possible and
      other orientations are contemplated.<br>
      <br>
      [0066] A blade center line of A′-A is shown in dashed lines and
      runs along the center and vertical diameter of a base circle 510 .
      A base circle 510 is sometimes used as reference points for
      various components. A small portion ( 520 of FIG. 7) of the base
      circle is removed to complete the blade. The remaining perimeter
      sections of the base circle are sometimes called arc 1 , arc 2 and
      arc 3 and are clearly shown in FIG. 17 and FIG. 18.<br>
      <br>
      [0067] FIG. 7 is a plan view featuring a disclosed connection flap
      130 , a removed section 520 and a first linear boundary 525 and a
      second linear boundary 530 defining outer edges of a finished
      blade. In the best mode known to date, the flap section is at a 54
      degree angle. In general the flap section is between 45 to 65
      degrees.<br>
      <br>
      [0068] The view of FIG. 7 is positioned to show the relative back
      side of the marked disk connection area 130 . The disk connection
      area is bent so as to facilitate the positioning of blades as
      contemplated in FIG. 9. The blade section formed by joining two
      disk connection areas can be instrumental in creating a moving
      vertex when spinning a disclosed blade system or assembly in
      fluid. While the disk connection area is perfectly symmetrical
      with respect to the blade centerline configuration, the assembled
      disc connection area presents an asymmetrical quality that is
      highly advantageous for mixing material.<br>
      <br>
      [0069] FIG. 8 discloses one construction of assembling or setting
      a center blade line A′-A at an angle from a vertical axis line.
      While an angle of 26 degrees is shown, other angles are
      contemplated. The vertical axis line shown at a right angle in
      FIG. 8 is sometimes called the absolute center line. A mixing
      shaft 300 may sometimes be attached in alignment with the absolute
      center line. The absolute center line may also be called the axis
      line. A center line is marked at Aq on top and q Axis on the
      bottom. The top of the face center line is marked Aq while the
      bottom of the face center line is marked A′q or A prime q.<br>
      <br>
      [0070] FIG. 9 is a continuation of FIG. 8, in that FIG. 9 shows
      three centerlines for attachment of three of A′-A center lines.
      The displayed center line guides at a projected bottom plane take
      the shape of an equilateral triangle. Points A′ will be angled
      away from the absolute center line by approximately 26 degrees.<br>
      <br>
      [0071] FIG. 10 is presented to more clearly reveal the disclosed
      angles and geometry of a disclosed blade 100 . FIG. 10 more
      clearly shows the term CL found long line A′-A. In FIG. 10 the
      term CL or centerline refers to the centerline of the drawn blade.
      In final assembly, only point A will be adjacent to the absolute
      center line shown in FIG. 9.<br>
      <br>
      [0072] FIG. 11 is a perspective view blade orientations referenced
      with a center system line 301 . An absolute center line is found
      at point A and travels downwardly to the center of the drawn
      equilateral triangle. Three points marked A′ are shown to be at an
      angle from the absolute center line. During construction, a
      temporary equilateral triangle may be used to facilitate the
      desired placement and retention of three blades. A construction
      triangle may be placed at or near the plane of the drawn
      equilateral triangle. Point A′ and edges A are aptly named, as
      blade points A′ and A are correspondingly attached.<br>
      <br>
      [0073] FIG. 12 is a perspective view of blade orientations. The
      axis is sometimes called the absolute center line.<br>
      <br>
      [0074] FIG. 13 is sectional view of disclosed blade orientations.
      A face center line is shown at an angle with respect to an axis
      line. The face center line could be described as an edge A-A′
      dihedral angle 26 degrees center line, from axis.<br>
      <br>
      [0075] FIG. 14 is a simplified version of one embodiment of a
      disclosed blade. Point A is shown at the bottom of the base circle
      510 and point A′ is shown on the top of the base circle. FIG. 14
      depicts a first fold line 500 , a second fold line 501 and a third
      fold line 502 .<br>
      <br>
      [0076] FIG. 15 depicts a plan view of a disclosed blade and
      presents disclosures of angles of fold lines and reference lines.<br>
      <br>
      [0077] FIG. 16 presents a disk or blade embodiment with the excess
      material removed just to the left of point A. The removed section
      is defined by lines 525 and 530 .<br>
      <br>
      [0078] FIG. 17 is a plan view of a disclosed blade. FIG. 17
      depicts is a blade or disk structure with various edges and points
      named in traditional methods. For example, points A′ and C define
      line A′-C.<br>
      <br>
      [0079] FIG. 18 is a plan view of a disclosed blade with depictions
      of various fold angles and other components and discloses various
      edges, points and angle of folding.<br>
      <br>
      [0080] Disclosed embodiments include, but are not limited to the
      following items:<br>
      <br>
      [0081] Item 1. A mixing and vortex organizing system, the system
      comprising:<br>
      <br>
      [0000] a plurality of mixing blades wherein each mixing blade
      comprises:<br>
      <br>
      [0082] a planer circular surface comprising three fold lines and a
      neutral center line with a first fold line bent in a forward
      direction between 45 and 55 degrees from the neutral center line,

      <b>Abstract</b><br>
      An air or watercraft propeller comprises a plurality of blade
      systems wherein each blade system is composed of a front leg
      attached to a back blade. The front legs pull air or water towards
      spinner while the back legs use vertical suction to draw air or
      water towards the spinner to complement the air or water flow
      created by the front legs. The back legs are angularly attached to
      the spinner at approximately 60 degrees rotated from the spinner
      center line. The back legs are also tilted to an angle of
      approximately 60 degrees from the surface of the spinner. The
      front legs are attached to the back legs at an angle of
      approximately 60 degrees. The propeller system presents several
      equilateral triangles to maximize propulsion efficiency. The front
      legs are rigidly attached to the spinner while the back legs may
      be adjusted for pitch.<br>
