      <div align="center"><b>'Rebuilt' immune system shakes off diabetes</b><br>
        <b>By Roxanne Khamsi</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Diabetics appear to have been cured with a one-off treatment that
      rebuilds their immune system, according to a new study.<br>
      <br>
      The technique, which uses patients’ own bone marrow cells, has
      freed 14 of 15 patients with type 1 diabetes from their dependence
      on insulin medication.<br>
      <br>
      So far, participants in the trial have gone 18 months without
      insulin therapy following the procedure, on average. One patient
      has lasted three years without needing such injections.<br>
      <br>
      In patients with type 1 diabetes, which typically strikes in early
      childhood or adolescence, the immune system appears to erroneously
      attack cells in the pancreas that produce the hormone insulin.
      Without insulin, blood sugar levels in the body spiral out of
      control. People with diabetes receive insulin therapy, often in
      the form of self-injected shots, to keep their blood sugar levels
      under control.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Wipe out</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Scientists have speculated that “resetting” the immune system
      might stop it from attacking the insulin-producing cells in the
      pancreas.<br>
      <br>
      Julio Voltarelli, at the University of Sao Paulo in Brazil, and
      colleagues recruited 15 people aged 14 to 31 years who had
      recently been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. Roughly 60% to 80%
      of these patients’ insulin-producing cells had been destroyed by
      the time of their diagnosis, and all needed regular insulin shots.<br>
      <br>
      The researchers removed bone marrow stem cells from the patients,
      who were then given drugs such as cytotoxan to wipe out their
      immune cells. Without an immune system, the patients were
      vulnerable to infection and so they were given antibiotics and
      kept in an isolation ward. They participants did not undergo
      radiation treatment – as leukaemia patients often do as part of a
      bone marrow transplant – and so had fewer side effects and less
      risk of organ damage.<br>
      <br>
      Two weeks later, the patients received infusions of their own stem
      cells into their bloodstream via the jugular vein, which
      re-established their immune systems.<br>
      <br>
      Throughout this time and following the stem cell transplant, the
      research team continued taking blood samples to assess how much
      insulin each patient required.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Free for life?</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Of the 15 patients, 12 no longer needed insulin shots within a few
      days of undergoing the procedure. One patient from the group had a
      relapse and needed to take insulin for one year, before becoming
      insulin-independent again – and has remained this way for 5
      months.<br>
      <br>
      Of the remaining two participants, one stopped needing insulin
      shots for one year after the transplant but has spent the past two
      months back on the shots, and the final participant’s diabetes did
      not respond to the stem cell treatment.<br>
      <br>
      Those who responded to the treatment have not needed insulin shots
      – so far, for an average 18 months – and had not relapsed at the
      time of study publication. One patient had gone as long as 35
      months without needing insulin therapy. “It may be that they
      become insulin-free for life. We don’t know,” says Voltarelli.<br>
      <br>
      Exactly why some patients responded to the treatment and one did
      not remains a mystery. “It could be due to differences in genetic
      background or severity of the immune attack,” Voltarelli suggests.<br>
      <br>
      During the course of the trial, one patient developed pneumonia as
      a result of the immune-suppressing drugs used in the procedure.
      Two others developed complications, including thyroid dysfunction
      and early menopause, but it is not clear if these relate to the
      stem cell transplant<br>
      <br>
      <b>Honeymoon period</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Jay Skyler, who heads the Diabetes Research Institute at the
      University of Miami in Florida, US, cautions that the trial did
      not include a control group. Skyler adds some people experience a
      remission of symptoms shortly after being diagnosed with type 1
      diabetes, and the increase in insulin production seen among study
      participants might be related to this “honeymoon period”.<br>
      <br>
      Skyler also notes it is unclear exactly how the insulin production
      in the patients increased.<br>
      <br>
      Still, he says that the trial has “shown some potentially
      promising results”. And Voltarelli is hopeful that this type of
      approach could help patients with type 1 diabetes avoid some of
      the long-term complications that arise from the illness, such as
      kidney, eye and nerve damage, which result from chronically high
      levels of blood sugar.<br>

      Leading expert in stem cell transplantation for the treatment of
      autoimmune diseases. Born on Dec 17, 1948, in Fernandópolis,
      Brazil, he died of complications of a liver transplant on March
      21, 2012, in Blumenau, Brazil, aged 63 years.<br>
      <br>
      Julio Voltarelli's passion and vision was to be able to modify the
      immune system in order to change a disease's course. As the
      coordinator of the Bone Marrow Transplant Unit at the Ribeirão
      Preto School of Medicine at the University of São Paulo in Brazil,
      Voltarelli was one of the first researchers in the world to use
      haemopoietic stem cells found in bone marrow to treat autoimmune
      diseases. “Julio was a pioneer driven by an internal compass,
      directed by uncanny intuition, steadied by intellect, and grounded
      by sincerity and honesty to improve this world through restoring
      to people what disease had extinguished”, says Richard Burt,
      associate professor and Chief of the Division of
      Medicine-Immunotherapy for Autoimmune Diseases at Northwestern
      University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago, USA. Since
      2001, Voltarelli's team has undertaken almost 200 stem cell
      transplantations for autoimmune diseases, including type 1
      diabetes, multiple sclerosis, systemic sclerosis, and lupus.<br>
      <br>
      Working with Burt, Voltarelli developed a protocol for
      transplanting stem cells in patients with type 1 diabetes. The
      researchers first removed cells from the bone marrow of patients
      and then treated the patients with radiation to destroy their
      immune systems, which were attacking the pancreatic ß cells
      responsible for producing insulin. Patients' stem cells were then
      injected back into their bone marrow in the hope of repopulating
      the pancreas with functioning ß cells. Voltarelli and his
      colleagues reported that 20 out of 23 patients who received the
      treatment no longer needed to inject insulin to control their
      blood sugar levels; for some, the treatment was effective for up
      to 3 years. It was, the researchers wrote in the Journal of the
      American Medical Association in 2009, “the only treatment capable
      of reversing type 1 DM [diabetes mellitus] in humans” at that
      time.<br>
      <br>
      Voltarelli encountered doubt and resistance from colleagues who
      questioned why diabetes should be treated with a high-risk
      transplantation procedure, according to Maria Carolina Oliveira, a
      staff physician in the Department of Internal Medicine at the
      Ribeirão Preto School of Medicine, who worked closely with
      Voltarelli. But the improvement in patients' quality of life with
      treatment and the possibility that chronic complications, such as
      eye and kidney disease, would diminish as a result validated
      Voltarelli's efforts. His contribution in Brazil was important,
      says Oliveira: “He will definitely be remembered for his courage
      and audacity. He started something new in the country and worked
      against other people's opinion, especially concerning the type 1
      diabetes stem cell transplantation protocol.”<br>
      <br>
      Voltarelli graduated from the Ribeirão Preto School of Medicine at
      the University of São Paulo in 1972 and completed a residency in
      internal medicine and haematology there 2 years later. He received
      a doctorate in haematology and clinical immunology from the same
      institution in 1981 and then completed postdoctoral fellowships in
      the USA at the University of California, San Francisco, the Fred
      Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, and the Scripps
      Research Institute in San Diego. In 1992, he returned to Brazil
      and established the Bone Marrow Transplant Unit at the Ribeirão
      Preto School of Medicine.<br>
      <br>
      Over the course of his career, Voltarelli published more than 130
      articles and edited the first book in Portuguese on stem cell
      transplantation and clinical immunology; he was also on the
      editorial board of the journal Cell Transplantation. Shortly
      before his death, his colleagues elected him President of the
      Brazilian Society of Bone Marrow Transplantation. Voltarelli
      lobbied for the creation of a national transplant register in
      Brazil and for the certification of physicians who perform
      transplantations in the country. “He was the most loyal and
      correct scientist I ever worked with. He was extremely smart but
      extremely modest. He always discussed all of the protocols and
      projects with the whole group, taking into account all opinions”,
      remembers Belinda Simoes, who worked with Voltarelli for 20 years
      and who is the current coordinator of the Bone Marrow Transplant
      Unit. Voltarelli is survived by his wife and two daughters.<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b><b>Objective</b><b><br>
      </b>Autologous nonmyeloablative hematopoietic stem cell
      transplantation (AHST) was the first therapeutic approach that can
      improve ß cell function in type 1 diabetic (T1D) patients. This
      study was designed to investigate the potential mechanisms
      involved.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Design and methods</b><b><br>
      </b>We applied AHST to nine T1D patients diagnosed within six
      months and analyzed the acute responses in peripheral blood for
      lymphocyte subpopulation as well as for genomic expression
      profiling at the six-month follow-up.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Results</b><b><br>
      </b>We found six patients obtained insulin free (IF group) and
      three remained insulin dependent (ID group); C-peptide production
      was significantly higher in IF group compared to ID group. The
      acute responses in lymphocytes at six-month follow-up include
      declined CD3+CD4+, CD3+CD8+ T cell population and recovered B
      cell, NK cell population in both groups but with no significant
      differences between the two groups; most immune-related genes and
      pathways were up-regulated in peripheral blood mononuclear cell
      (PBMC) of both groups while none of transcription factors for
      immune regulatory component were significantly changed; the IF
      group demonstrated more AHST-modified genetic events than the ID
      group and distinct pattern of top pathways, co-expression network
      as well as ‘hub’ genes (eg, TCF7 and GZMA) were associated with
      each group.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Conclusions</b><b><br>
      </b>AHST could improve the islet function in newly diagnosed T1D
      patients and elimination of the islet specific autoreactive T
      cells might be one of the mechanisms involved; T1D patients
      responded differently to AHST possibly due to the distinct
      transcriptional events occurring in PBMC.<br>
      <br>
      Type 1 diabetes (T1DM) is an organ specific autoimmune disease,
      resulting from chronic immune attack against pancreatic beta cells
      [1]. Although it is thought to be mediated mainly by T helper 1
      cells, a complex interaction of immune cells including CD4+T cell,
      CD8+Tcell and innate immune cell NK cell, B cell and antigen
      presentation cell is actually involved in the pathogenesis [2].
      This course of immune-destruction is subclinical until
      approximately 60% to 80% of the beta-cell mass is destroyed, when
      the amount of beta-cell mass is insufficient to maintain glucose
      homeostasis and the clinical diagnosis of T1DM is established [3].
      The best-established treatment is to tightly control the blood
      glucose by intensive insulin therapy [4]. However, long-term
      substitutive insulin therapy is still associated with major
      constraints and lack of effectiveness in preventing chronic
      vascular and neurological complications. Immunointervention
      therapy, which targets the causal pathogenic mechanism, therefore,
      may represent the only sensible strategy. Clinical trial of
      immunosuppression drugs (cyclosporine), antigen therapy (GAD) or
      immunoregulatory agents (anti-CD3 antibody) have obtained efficacy
      in patients with T1DM, however obstacles such as adverse effects,
      lack of long-lasting improvement and especially the exogenous
      insulin requirement remain still as a medical challenging [5].<br>
      <br>
      In 2007, Julio C. Voltarelli's group reported the first clinical
      trial using AHST as a potential approach in cases of T1D [6].
      Indeed, for the first time these studies demonstrated that AHST
      led to prolonged insulin independence coupled with a significant
      increase of c-peptide production. A follow-up study published two
      years later confirmed the insulin independence was due to improved
      ß cell function instead of a prolonged honeymoon [7]. Therefore,
      AHST has been the only T1D-related management shown to preserve ß
      cell function. However, AHST requires a relatively aggressive
      immune-intervention and complications such as pneumonia and
      endocrine dysfunction have been noted. Therefore, a need exists to
      be able to target those patients who will receive the most benefit
      from AHST and to further clarify the mechanisms involved in ß cell
      function recovery so that the strategy can be optimized and a
      broader patient population can benefit from this treatment
      approach.<br>
      <br>
      In this study, we applied AHST therapy to a group of nine patients
      with newly diagnosed T1D and specifically investigated their
      immune reconstitution, as well as performed transcriptome
      profiling on their PBMC pre-treatment and six months
      post-treatment to identify the acute responsive events, which
      might give helpful insights to clarify the therapeutic
      mechanisms...<br>
      <br>
      <b>Results</b><b><br>
      </b>We found six patients obtained insulin free (IF group) and
      three remained insulin dependent (ID group); C-peptide production
      was significantly higher in IF group compared to ID group. The
      acute responses in lymphocytes at six-month follow-up include
      declined CD3+CD4+, CD3+CD8+ T cell population and recovered B

      Current approaches aiming to cure type 1 diabetes (T1D) have made
      a negligible number of patients insulin-independent. In this
      review, we revisit the role of stem cell (SC)-based applications
      in curing T1D. The optimal therapeutic approach for T1D should
      ideally preserve the remaining ß-cells, restore ß-cell function,
      and protect the replaced insulin-producing cells from
      autoimmunity. SCs possess immunological and regenerative
      properties that could be harnessed to improve the treatment of
      T1D; indeed, SCs may reestablish peripheral tolerance toward
      ß-cells through reshaping of the immune response and inhibition of
      autoreactive T-cell function. Furthermore, SC-derived
      insulin-producing cells are capable of engrafting and reversing
      hyperglycemia in mice. Bone marrow mesenchymal SCs display a
      hypoimmunogenic phenotype as well as a broad range of
      immunomodulatory capabilities, they have been shown to cure newly
      diabetic nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice, and they are currently
      undergoing evaluation in two clinical trials. Cord blood SCs have
      been shown to facilitate the generation of regulatory T cells,
      thereby reverting hyperglycemia in NOD mice. T1D patients treated
      with cord blood SCs also did not show any adverse reaction in the
      absence of major effects on glycometabolic control. Although
      hematopoietic SCs rarely revert hyperglycemia in NOD mice, they
      exhibit profound immunomodulatory properties in humans; newly
      hyperglycemic T1D patients have been successfully reverted to
      normoglycemia with autologous nonmyeloablative hematopoietic SC
      transplantation. Finally, embryonic SCs also offer exciting
      prospects because they are able to generate glucose-responsive
      insulin-producing cells. Easy enthusiasm should be mitigated
      mainly because of the potential oncogenicity of SCs.<br>

      <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b>Stem cell therapy is one of the most promising treatments for
      the near future. It is expected that this kind of therapy can
      ameliorate or even reverse some diseases. With regard to type 1
      diabetes, studies analyzing the therapeutic effects of stem cells
      in humans began in 2003 in the Hospital das Clínicas of the
      Faculty of Medicine of Ribeirão Preto - SP USP, Brazil, and since
      then other centers in different countries started to randomize
      patients in their clinical trials. Herein we summarize recent data
      about beta cell regeneration, different ways of immune
      intervention and what is being employed in type 1 diabetic
      patients with regard to stem cell repertoire to promote
      regeneration and/or preservation of beta cell mass.The Diabetes
      Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) was a 7-year longitudinal
      study that demonstrated the importance of the intensive insulin
      therapy when compared to conventional treatment in the development
      of chronic complications in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus
      (T1DM). This study also demonstrated another important issue:
      there is a reverse relationship between C-peptide levels
      (endogenous indicator of insulin secretion) chronic complications
      - that is, the higher the C-peptide levels, the lower the
      incidence of nephropathy, retinopathy and hypoglycemia. From such
      data, beta cell preservation has become an additional target in
      the management of T1DM 1.<br>
