      <p><b><br>
          (1) Early Prohibition ~</b><a name="earlyproh"></a> </p>
      <p>The Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906 was the first Federal law to
        concern cannabis. Any quantity of the substance (and several
        others, such as alcohol, opium, cocaine and chloral hydrate) had
        to be clearly stated on the label of any food or drug sold to
        the public. </p>
      <p>Social reformers tried to include cannabis in the proscriptions
        of the Harrison Act of 1914, but at that time the pharmaceutical
        industry successfully opposed its inclusion since it was an
        ingredient of corn plasters and several other medicaments, and
        it was widely used in veterinary medicine. The Harrison Act
        required importers, producers and dealers in opium and coca
        products to register and pay an occupational tax. The registered
        parties had to file detailed reports of their drug transactions,
        each of which was recorded. The awkward procedures were designed
        to be unworkable in practice, in order to indirectly discourage
        any traffic in opiates and cocaine. In a Supreme Court decision
        upholding the Harrison Act (US vs Doremus, 1919), the dissenting
        judges argued that, "The statute was a mere attempt by Congress
        to exert a power not delegated, that is, the reserved police
        power of the States". Congress used this obtuse approach to
        regulating drugs by taxation because, as the Supreme Court
        affirmed in its decision in Linder vs US (125), "Direct control
        of medical practice in the states is beyond the power of the
        Federal Government", according to the 10th Amendment. </p>
      <p>The first legislations against narcotics were largely ad hoc
        attempts to "do something" about a problem that arguably did not
        exist as it was perceived. Cannabis also fell victim to
        society’s fear of the unfettered human mind, for marijuana is
        "the stuff that dreams are made of.. the thing that white folks
        are afraid of", as it was aptly described in a jazz song of the
        era. </p>
      <p>The few informed dissenters who found a public forum for their
        opinions were largely ignored. For example, during hearings held
        before the House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee in
        January 1911, the representative of the National Wholesale
        Druggists’ Association testified that cannabis was not a
        habit-forming drug. Albert Plaut, representing the
        pharmaceutical firm of Lehn and Fink, stated that cannabis’ bad
        reputation could be attributed to fictional literature rather
        than to informed opinion, and correctly pointed out that the
        drug was not attractive to opium or cocaine addicts. Other
        authorities, such as Dr Charles Fauns, testified that cannabis
        was habit-forming: </p>
      <p>"To my mind, it would be inexcusable for a man to say that
        there is no habit from the use of that drug. There is no drug in
        Pharmacopoeia today that would produce the pleasurable
        sensations you would get from cannabis, no not one ---
        absolutely not a drug in the Pharmacopoeia today, and of all the
        drugs on earth I would certainly put that on the list". (1) </p>
      <p>The Louisiana legislature in 1911 prohibited pharmacists from
        refilling prescriptions that contained cannabis, opium, or
        cocaine. The city of El Paso, TX passed an ordinance to ban the
        sale and possession of marijuana in 1914. Also that year, the
        city of New York added cannabis to its list of prohibited drugs.
        The New York Times (30 July 1914) reported this amendment of the
        Sanitary Code, and ominously editorialized that, "The inclusion
        of cannabis indica among the drugs to be sold only on
        prescription is only common sense. Devotees of hashish are now
        hardly numerous enough here to count, but they are likely to
        increase as other narcotics become harder to obtain". </p>
      <p>By 1915, several New England and Western states had passed laws
        against cannabis, in anticipation of future problems. By the
        time the infamous federal marihuana Tax Act was passed in 1937,
        all but a few states had already outlawed cannabis, usually for
        arbitrary reasons and without any opposition. </p>
      <p>The passage of the 18th Amendment in 1919 and its enforcement
        legislature, the Volstead Act of 1920, made alcohol more costly,
        difficult to acquire, and dangerous to use. The market for
        cannabis, which was uncontrolled, rose accordingly to meet the
        intractable demand for intoxicants. </p>
      <p><b>(2) Conspiracy vs Cannabis ~</b><a name="conspiracy"></a> </p>
      <p>Cannabis was suppressed in America for several reasons. Moral
        entrepreneurs were wont to claim that marijuana is a heinous,
        seductive narcotic that causes insanity and crime. That was pure
        propaganda that has been disproven since then, yet millions of
        true believers continue to deny the facts. Marijuana also was
        associated with Mexicans, Negroes, jazz, sex and violence. It
        quickly became a convenient scapegoat for white Christian
        Americans who resented the existence and presence of minority
        races. The media was happy to indulge their fantasies and fears
        with numerous unsubstantiated accounts of "marijuana madness". </p>
      <p>Another reason for the suppression of cannabis in America was
        that hemp products threatened certain vested financial and
        industrial interests that conspired to destroy the industry.
        They supported the zealous moral reformers who sought its
        prohibition at the federal level. The petro-chemical and pulp
        paper industries in particular stood to lose billions of dollars
        if the commercial potential of hemp was fully realized. Hemp
        researchers Jack Herer and Chris Conrad have shown that much of
        the blame can be laid on a few individuals, particularly E.I. Du
        Pont and William R. Hearst. In the 1920s, the DuPont Company
        developed and patented fuel additives such as tetraethyl lead,
        and the sulfate and sulfite processes for manufacture of pulp
        paper, and numerous new synthetic products such as nylon,
        cellophane and other plastics. At the same time, other companies
        were developing synthetic products from renewable biomass
        resources, especially hemp. For example, in the 1930s, Ford
        Motor Company engineers successfully operated a pilot plant at
        Iron Mountain (MI), where they produced alcohol, charcoal, tar
        and other stock chemicals from hemp. </p>
      <p>Furthermore, the Schlichten decorticator promised to eliminate
        much of the need for wood pulp paper, thus threatening to reduce
        the value of timberland owned by Hearst, Kimberly-Clark, and
        others. DuPont, Hearst, and their associates lobbied and
        conspired to crush the competition posed by hemp, and they
        succeeded. For example, from 1935 to 1937, I.I. DuPont
        personally lobbied the chief counsel of the Treasury Department,
        Herman Oliphant, and repeatedly assured him that DuPont’s
        synthetic petrochemicals (i.e., urethane), could replace
        hempseed oil in the marketplace. Some large pharmaceutical
        companies also stood to gain by the criminalization of cannabis,
        since their patented prescription tranquilizers (barbituates,
        etc) would replace cannabis to some extent. </p>
      <p><b>(3) Racist Propaganda ~</b><a name="prpaganda"></a> </p>
      <p>Public perception of hemp after 1915 was strongly influenced by
        numerous newspaper and magazine articles that ascribed every
        evil to the ifluence of marijuana, just as opium and cocaine had
        been demonized and vilified years before. Newspaper magnate
        William Randolph Hearst fed the public with a steady diet of
        "yellow journalism" for which he was famed. Hearst hated
        minorities, and he used his chain of papers to aggravate racial
        tensions at every opportunity. Hearst especially hated Mexicans
        since he had lost some 800,000 acres of prime timberland to the
        rebel army of Pancho Villa. Hearst constantly portrayed Mexicans
        as lazy, violent, degenerate, marijuana-smoking job-stealers.
        Other racists with pretensions to "Keep America American" were
        happy to ride the bandwagon. The attitude of C. M. Goethe, a
        prominent member of the American Coalition, was typical: </p>
      <p>"Marijuana, perhaps now the most insidious of our narcotics, is
        a direct by-product of unrestricted Mexican immigration. Easily
        grown, it has been asserted that it has recently been planted
        between rows in a California penitentiary garden. Mexican
        peddlers have been caught distributing sample marihuana cigarets
        to school children. Bills for our quota against Mexico have been
        blocked mysteriously in every Congress since the 1924 Quota Act.
        Our nation has more than enough laborers". </p>
      <p>The Missionary Education Movement made the same claim: </p>
      <p>"The use of marijuana is not uncommon in the colonies of the
        lower class of Mexican immigrant. This is a native drug made
        from what is sometimes called the ‘crazy weed’. The effects are
        high exhilaration and intoxication, followed by extreme
        depression and broken nerves. [Police] Officers and Mexicans
        both ascribe many of the moral irregularities of Mexicans to the
        effect of marijuana". (2) </p>
      <p>The city of Los Angeles arrested many Mexicans for "disturbing
        the peace" and for possession of marijuana, and deported them by
        the trainload as a money-saving measure. A single trainload
        saved an estimated $350,000 of the county’s welfare budget. An
        article in the Fraternal Order of Police Journal quoted LA’s
        chief of detectives Joseph L. Taylor as saying: </p>
      <p>"Marihuana is possibly the most dangerous of all our narcotic
        drugs... In the past we have had officers of this department
        shot and killed by marihuana addicts and have traced the act of
        murder directly to the influence of marihuana, with no other
        motive. Numerous assaults have been made upon officers and
        citizens with intent to kill by marihuana addicts which were
        directly traceable to the influence of marihuana". </p>
      <p>A similar anecdote was reported by a captain of detectives in
        Texas: </p>
      <p>"The reason is that when they are addicted to the use they
        become very violent, especially when they become angry, and will
        attack an officer even if a gun is drawn on him. They seem to
        have no fear. I have also noted that when under the influence of
        this weed they have abnormal strength and that it will take
        several men to handle one man where under ordinary circumstances
        one man could handle him with ease". </p>
      <p>In 1914 a deputy sheriff from El Paso (TX) convinced the local
        Food and Drug inspector that Mexican "loco-weed" was a problem
        requiring federal attention. The inspector advised the chief of
        the Agriculture Department’s Bureau of Chemistry to do
        something. Acting under the authority of the Food and Drug Act,
        which was enforced by the TD’s Bureau of Customs, the Secretary
        of the Treasury issued Treasury Decision 35719 declaring that
        Mexicans who brought cannabis across the border were smugglers.
        In 11917, the chief of the Bureau of Chemistry, Dr Alsberg, sent
        Reginald Smith to Texas to determine the effect of TD 35719.
        Smith found that marijuana was used medically by Mexicans "of
        low birth" to treat asthma, gonorrhea, headaches, and to assist
        in childbirth, but its main use was for recreation". (3) </p>
      <p>Several companies (Parke-Davis in particular) distributed tons
        of marijuana in Texas and the southwest, where it was sold over
        the counter in one-ounce packages and in tinctures, and by
        mail-order. The druggists who were interviewed by Smith for his
        report stated that marijuana was purchased not only by Mexicans,
        but also by "Negroes, and chauffeurs, and a low class of whites
        such as those addicted to the use of habit-forming drugs, and
        hangers-on of the underworld". Smith declared TD 35719 was
        ineffectual and recommended that marijuana be included in the
        Harrison Act. </p>
      <p>The Federal government of Mexico also feared that that the use
        of marijuana by peasants and soldiers would infect and
        contaminate the aristocracy, and in 1920 published a regulation
        concerning commerce in marijuana. In 1917, a Spanish language
        newspaper editorial in a San Antonio newspaper warned its
        Mexican readers: </p>
      <p>"[Marijuana] is terribly noxious when used as a narcotic, from
        which a dangerous vice is acquired by those who make a bad use
        of it, as happens among the lower classes in Mexico... </p>
      <p>The men who smoke this herb become excited to such an extent
        that they go through periods of near frenzy, and worse, it is
        always aggressive as [attested by] the crimes which have been
        committed in garrisons, armories, barracks, and the humble
        suburbs of Mexico. </p>
      <p>"In the South of the United States, this menacing evil has
        begun to appear, especially in the army and among the Negroes...
      </p>
      <p>"The authorities... [must] uproot this malicious vice in its
        incipiency as it is growing even in the army among members of
        distinguished families and also as it is happening in Mexico
        among young men of good society; this, of course, is doubly
        lamentable". </p>
      <p>Other federal authorities were quite unconcerned about the
        non-issue and remained so for another decade or more. The US
        Bureau of Plant Industry issued a statement to that effect in
        1926: </p>
      <p>"Recent reports... of the effect of the drug on Mexicans,
        making them want to ‘clean up the town’, do not jibe very well
        with the effects of cannabis, which so far as we have reports,
        simply causes temporary elation followed by depression and heavy
        sleep. </p>
      <p>"Though they have ample opportunity, workers in the hemp fields
        have never become addicts. The hasheesh-producing varieties of
        hemp were introduced extensively into American culture a few
        years ago through the efforts of the Department of Agriculture,
        for cannabis has a large and legitimate use in veterinary
        medicine. The cultivation of the drug hemp was carried on mainly
        in South Carolina. Large numbers of Negro workers were employed
        in the business, yet no cases of hasheesh addiction were
        reported". (4) </p>
      <p>A major drug study conducted by the US Special narcotic
        Committee, appointed by the Secretary of the Treasury in 1918,
        did not find it necessary even to mention cannabis in its
        report. A study of "The Prevalence and Trend of Drug Addiction
        in the United States and Factors Influencing It" was made by the
        US Public Health Service in 1924, but cannabis was not
        mentioned. The 400-page report issued by the First World
        Conference on Narcotic Education (July 1926) concerned itself
        entirely with opium and cocaine and did not give any notice to
        cannabis. (5,6) </p>
      <p><b>(4) Cannabis &amp; Crime ~</b><a name="c&amp;crime"></a> </p>
      <p>A turning point came when a clique of New Orleans city
        officials blamed marijuana for creating a crime wave in 1926,
        then transmuted it into a stack of political hay that eventually
        moved to Washington DC. The New Orleans <i>Item</i> and the <i>Morning




          Tribune</i> newspapers were quick to sensationalize the
        delusion, and focused on its use by "children" who were in fact
        streetwise youths and anything but innocent victims: </p>
      <p>"It was definitely ascertained that school children of 44
        schools (only a few of them were high schools) were smoking
        ‘mootas’. Verifications came in by the hundreds from harassed
        parents, teachers, neighborhood pastors, priests, welfare
        workers, and club women... The Waif’s Home, at this time, was
        reputedly full of children, both white and colored, who had been
        brought in under the influence of the drug. Marijuana cigarettes
        could be bought almost as readily as sandwiches. Their cost was
        two for a quarter. The children solved the problem of cost by
        pooling pennies among members of a group and then passing the
        cigarettes from one to another, all the puffs being carefully
        counted". </p>
      <p>"The New Orleans coroner. Dr George Roeling, offered a
        pseudo-scientific explanation for the supposed link between
        marijuana and crime: </p>
      <p>"This marihuana drug stimulates the cortical cerebral centers
        and inhibits the controlling sub-cortical centers of our
        mechanism which is responsible for... bolstering up their
        courage and the various phenomena which will eventually... lead
        them into the most crime-producing individuals that we have". </p>
      <p>As could be expected, soon afterwards in 1927, the Louisiana
        legislature passed a law imposing a maximum penalty of six
        months in jail or a $500 fine for the possession or sale of
        marijuana. Highly publicized roundups resulted, but the effort
        was utterly futile. Frank Gomila, the city Commissioner of
        Public Safety, reported a few years later that New Orleans had
        experienced a crime wave that was aggravated by marihuana: </p>
      <p>"Payroll and bank guards were doubled, but this did not prevent
        some of the most spectacular holdups in the history of the city.
        Youngsters known to be ‘muggle-heads’ fortified themselves with
        the narcotic and proceeded to shoot down police, bank clerks and
        casual bystanders". </p>
      <p>Mr Eugene Stanley, the District Attorney, announced that many
        of the crimes in New Orleans and the South were committed by
        criminals who relied on marijuana to give them a false courage
        and freedom from restraint. Dr George Roeling, Coroner, reported
        that of 450 prisoners investigated, 125 were confirmed users of
        marijuana. Mr W. B. Graham, State Narcotic Officer, made this
        declaration in 1936: </p>
      <p>"60 per cent of the crimes committed in New Orleans were by
        marihuana users... Practically every negro in the city can give
        a recognizable description of the drug’s effects... Cigarettes
        are hard to get and are selling at 30 to 40 cents apiece, which
        is a relatively high price and a particularly good indication of
        the effectiveness of the present control". </p>
      <p>In other words, a decade of law enforcement has merely double
        the price of marijuana without reducing consumption. </p>
      <p>The crusading demagogue Dr A. E. Fosser resuscitated the myth
        of the hashish-Assassins in the <i>New Orleans Medical and
          Surgical Journal</i> (1931), wherein he made these claims: </p>
      <p>"The underworld was quick to realize that marihuana was an
        ideal drug to quickly cut off the inhibition, especially in the
        light of inadequate personality. Under the influence of cannabis
        indica, these human derelicts are quickly subjugated by the will
        of the master mind. The moral principles or training initiated
        in the mind from infancy may deter from committing willful
        theft, murder or rape, but this inhibition from crime may be
        destroyed by the addiction to marihuana... </p>
      <p>"The debasing and baneful influence of hashish and opium is not
        restricted to individuals but has manifested itself in nations
        and races as well. The dominant race and most enlightened
        countries are alcoholic, whilst the races and nations addicted
        to hemp and opium, some of which once attained to heights of
        culture and civilization have deteriorated both mentally and
        physically. </p>
      <p>"While it is most unfortunate for humanity to be subjugated by
        intoxicants or narcotics of any kind, which at this state of our
        civilization seems to be a necessary evil, the possible
        substitution of alcohol for a greater evil should be considered
        the greatest possible calamity that can befall a nation. It is
        not confined to the criminal class". (7) </p>
      <p>Writing for the <i>American Journal of Police Science</i>,
        Eugene Stanley reiterated Fossier’s opinions without offering
        any empirical evidence to support his assertions: </p>
      <p>"[Marihuana] is an ideal drugs to cut off inhibitions
        quickly... At the present time the underworld has been quick to
        realize the value of this drug in subjugating the will of human
        derelicts to that of a mastermind. Its use sweeps away all
        restraint, and to its influence may be attributed many of our
        present-day crimes, It has been the experience of Police and
        Prosecuting officials in the South, that immediately before the
        commission of many crimes the use of marihuana cigarettes has
        been indulged in by criminals, so as to relieve themselves from
        the natural restraint which might deter them from the commission
        of criminal acts, and to give them the fake courage necessary to
        commit the contemplated crimes. </p>
      <p>"Inasmuch as the harmful effects of the use of marihuana are
        daily becoming more widely known, and since it has been
        classified as a narcotic by the statutory laws of seventeen
        American States, England and Mexico, and since persons addicted
        to its use have been made eligible for treatment in the United
        States Narcotic Farms, the United States Government will
        unquestioningly be compelled to adopt a consistent attitude
        towards it, and include it in the Harrison Anti-narcotic Law, so
        as to give Federal aid to the States in their effort to suppress
        a traffic as deadly and as destructive to society as that in the
        other forms of narcotics now prohibited by this act". (8) </p>
      <p>The bibliography of Stanley’s article was drawn entirely from
        the references listed by Fossier. Neither writer actually read
        the documents they cited since the <i>Indian hemp Commission
          Report</i> (1893-94), for example, in fact drew conclusions
        opposite to the summary opinions of Fossier and Stanley. Their
        publications, however, had a strong influence on the perception
        of cannabis by law enforcement officials, and the two articles
        were cited in several subsequent court cases and during the
        congressional hearings for the Marihuana Tax Act in 1937. </p>
      <p>William Hearst used his chain of newspapers to continuously
        publish hate-mongering racist articles that fueled America’s
        xenophobia with terrifying headlines such as: "Marihuana Makes
        Fiends of Boys in 30 Days: Hashish Goads Users to Blood-Lust!",
        "New Dope Lure, Marihuana, Has Many Victims", "Hotel Clerk
        Identifies Marihuana Smoker as ‘Wild Gunman’ Arrested for
        Shootings". A spate of articles that appeared in popular
        magazines featured titles such as "Marihuana: Assassin of Youth"
        (<i>American Magazine</i>), "Sex Crazing Drug Menace" (<i>Physical




          Culture</i>), and "Youth Gone Loco" (<i>Christian Century</i>).




        Amongst the dreadful effects attributed to "The Menace of
        Marihuana" in the <i>International Medical Digest</i>, there
        was a particularly tragic case: "A boy and a girl who had lost
        their sense so completely after smoking marihuana eloped and
        were married". (9) </p>
      <p>An unqualified article linking marihuana, crime and insanity,
        written by M.A. Hayes and L. E. Bowery (a policeman from Wichita
        KS) was published in <i>The Journal of Criminal Law and
          Criminology</i> (1932), and thereafter it was often cited as a
        definitive study. Hayes and Bowery asserted that the marihuana
        user is capable of "great feats of strength and endurance,
        during which no fatigue is felt... sexual desires are stimulated
        and may lead to unnatural acts, such as indecent exposure and
        rape". The authors supported their claims with an unrelated
        newspaper account drawn from the Chicago <i>Herald-Examiner</i>
        (1926): </p>
      <p>"A Kansas hasheesh eater thinks he is a white elephant. Six
        months ago they found him strolling along a road, a few miles
        out of Topeka. He was naked, his clothing strewn along the
        highway for a mile. He was not violently insane, but crazy ---
        he said he was an elephant and acted as much like one as his
        limited physique would let him. Marihuana did it". </p>
      <p>The authors offered further support for their fantasies with a
        single "case history": </p>
      <p>"F, age 22, with a long police record, states that at one time
        he was a user, but that upon becoming acquainted with the evil,
        ceased its use. He said further that it caused him to suffer
        weird hallucination, and to commit acts he would not normally
        have considered. F reported several instances of which he
        claimed to have positive knowledge, where boys had induced girls
        to use the weed for the purpose of seducing them. He reports
        that its use is prevalent among members of the National Guard. </p>
      <p>"Investigators’ note: While he claims to have ceased its use,
        this young man has all the appearances of a weed-head with the
        symptoms given by medical authorities... </p>
      <p>"It is impossible to fix a definite time in which one becomes
        an addict... After the chronic use of marihuana ‘cannibomania’
        develops, which in many persons, especially if psychotic, leads
        to a loss of mental activity. Each experience ends in the
        destruction of brain tissues and nerve centers, and does
        irreparable damage. If continued, the inevitable result is
        insanity, which those familiar with it describe as absolutely
        incurable, and without exception ending in death. Statistics
        show that from 17 to 20 per cent of all males admitted to mental
        hospitals and asylums in India have become insane through the
        use of this drug". </p>
      <p>The Wickersham Commission (the National Commission on Law
        Observance and Enforcement), appointed by President Hoover in
        1929, published a "Report on Crime and the Foreign Born" that
        again focused attention on the alleged association of marihuana,
        Mexicans, and crime: </p>
      <p>"There are two other factors which no doubt play no unimportant
        role in bringing about the arrest of many Mexicans. The first is
        drunkenness... A second factor is marihuana. In the Southwestern
        states and in Mexico, marihuana is known as "loco weed" -- that
        is, "crazy" -- because of the effects it produces. It is used
        for making cigarettes, and is not only a powerful drug, but to
        all appearances renders the user either drunk or crazy. The
        South Chicago police told me of one Mexican who needed four
        officers to subdue him. It is especially insidious because it
        causes the brain and nervous system to deteriorate. To what
        extent it is being used it is impossible to learn, because those
        using it, like morphine and cocaine addicts, are secretive. Its
        use is not confined to Mexicans only, for within the past year
        four youths of other nationalities charged with a series of
        robberies admitted that they had to get ‘loaded’ with marihuana
        before they could stage their nightly forays". (10) </p>
      <p>In a Tulsa newspaper article of 1931, headlined "Marihuana,
        Deadly Drug, As Yet Unregulated by United States Law", a county
        prosecutor assured the readers thus: </p>
      <p>"The general use of the drug among young people is making it
        imperative that the state or the government of the United States
        take immediate steps to cope with this deadly drug, the dope
        which is used by murderers... </p>
      <p>"In some eastern cities, it has been learned, the gunman has
        discovered that the weed offers him something new, in the way of
        courage -- courage to kill. </p>
      <p>"It is notoriously a fact, authorities point out, that gunmen,
        who occupy the lowest levels in the ranks of crime, are usually
        cowards. To undertake murder, they need something to ‘pep them
        up’. A few whiffs of a marihuana cigarette, mixed with tobacco
        and he loses all sense of fear". </p>
      <p><b>(5) Anslinger and the FBN ~</b><a name="anslinger"></a> </p>
      <p>On October 30, 1929, Senator Sheppard (TX) introduced bill S.
        2075 to amend The Narcotics Drugs Import and Export Act of 1922
        to include cannabis. Other Congressmen urged the Bureau of
        Prohibition to amend the Harrison Act. The Bureau of Prohibition
        opposed both proposals because cannabis was a domestic crop. As
        such, it could not be controlled by federal legislature unless
        it involved interstate or international commerce, according to
        the prevailing court interpretations of the constitutional
        separation of state and federal powers. Therefore, the Bureau of
        Prohibition promoted the Uniform Act, which made the states
        responsible for enforcing the law. The bureau also tried to
        promote international control of cannabis by the League of
        Nations, but the American proposals were rebuffed as the Second
        Geneva Opium Conference in 1925. </p>
      <p>A. Tennyson, the legal advisor of the bureau, drafted a letter
        to Phipps (January 25, 1929), explaining the Bureau’s opposition
        to S. 2075: </p>
      <p>"[The] evils represented by the abuse of cannabis indica... do
        not appear to be nearly as widespread as those connected with
        the possession of opium, coca leaves or their derivatives, the
        former being confined to the southwest and midwest states and
        possibly in some of the larger cities. It is thought that this
        evil may more properly be met by state and municipal
        legislation, for which there is more ample fundamental
        authority. I respectively venture the suggestion that if the
        abuse of cannabis indica... exists to an appreciable extent in
        Colorado, the matter be referred to the state legislature for
        appropriate attention." </p>
      <p>In preparing the bureau’s position paper on S. 2075, secretary
        Harry Anslinger of the Federal Narcotics Control Board asked the
        American Medical Association and the American Drug Manufacturers
        Association to submit responses to several questions about the
        use of cannabis in medicine. The AMA in particular resented any
        increase in governmental control of physicians and pharmacists.
        Dr. William Woodward, who directed the AMA Bureau of Legal
        Medicine (and later testified against the Marihuana Tax Act in
        1937), wrote a caustic reply to Anslinger&nbsp; (28 April 1930):
      </p>
      <p>"Before your letter was referred to this bureau, it was
        referred to our Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry, and when it
        was referred to me, I was informed that the Council had never
        had occasion to give consideration to the questions you raise.
        The same might said to be generally true with reference to this
        bureau; it has never had occasion to give consideration to most
        of the questions raised by your letter, and I doubt whether any
        other agency, public or private, has ever had occasion to do so,
        unless it be the US Dept. of Agriculture and several analogous
        departments of the state governments. I presume that you have,
        of course, communicated with the US Dept of Agriculture, and if
        you have not communicated with the several analogous state
        departments, it might be worth your while to do so. </p>
      <p>"Undertaking to answer so far as practicable your specific
        questions, the following information is offered in response to
        the particular questions propounded by you:&nbsp; I. What is the
        quantity of Indian hemp produced in the United States? Ans. ---
        The American Medical Association has no knowledge with respect
        to this matter;&nbsp; II. What is the geographical distribution
        of the areas where Indian hemp is grown within the United
        States? Ans. --- The AMA has no information with respect to this
        matter except as may be found in books and journals, with which
        information, it is presumed, you are already familiar; III. What
        are the medical needs and uses of the drug or drugs produced
        from Indian Hemp? Ans. --- The answer to this question can be
        found in standard books on pharmacology and therapeutics, which
        are available in large numbers in the Surgeon General’s library
        in Washington; IV.&nbsp; What is the comparative medical value
        of Indian Hemp as domestically produced and as produced in
        foreign countries? Ans. -- [ditto]" </p>
      <p>Since 1922, Dr Woodward had worked with the AMA to test the
        feasibility of including cannabis in the Uniform Act, and he had
        conducted an independent survey to gather pharmacists’ opinions
        on the matter. He was amazed to learn that all but one
        respondent refuted the popular view that cannabis was addictive
        or even "habit-forming", and none knew of any abuse of its
        pharmaceutical preparations. </p>
      <p>On June 28, 1930, Anslinger informed Senator Smoot, the
        chairman of the Finance Committee, the "There would be no
        objection to the enactment of a separate measure prohibiting the
        importation and exportation of this particular drug". The bill
        died in committee. </p>
      <p>On August 12, 1930, the Federal Bureau of Narcotics (FBN) was
        established under the aegis of the Treasury Department. Harry J.
        Anslinger was chosen by Andrew Mellon and appointed as the first
        commissioner of the FBN. He held the post until President John F
        Kennedy ousted him in 1962, after Anslinger tried to censor
        Professor Alfred Lindsmith’s landmark book, The Addict and the
        law. Anslinger went so far as to harass Lindsmith’s employer,
        Indiana University, with threats of blackmail. Anslinger also
        was a rabid racist who drew criticism from Senator Joseph Guffey
        in 1934, after Anslinger used terms such as "ginger-colored
        nigger" and the like in his official FBN letters. </p>
      <p>In the first few years after its inception, the FBN minimized
        the marihuana issue and argued that the individual states should
        control the problem. The Bureau of Narcotics was hard-pressed to
        survive in the Depression economy, and initially limited its
        efforts to enforcing the Harrison Act against opium and cocaine
        and promoting the passage of the Uniform Act. Except for bill S.
        2075, which died in committee, cannabis was not yet a federal
        issue of any significance. </p>
      <p>Anslinger worked hard, however, to build a case against the
        plant. Some analysts have suggested that he took on the issue of
        cannabis in order to increase the power of the tiny FBN. Jack
        Herer, author of The Emperor Wears No Cloths, has shown that
        Anslinger acted as a front man, having been groomed for the task
        and appointed by his uncle-in-law Andrew Mellon, the corrupt
        banker who financed the DuPonts and who self-served as Secretary
        of the Treasury. In short, Andrew Mellon, Herman Oliphant,I.E.
        DuPont, William Hearst, and Harry Anslinger conspired to effect
        a petrochemical coup for the oiligarchists, to the detriment of
        the American ecology, economy, and citizenry. </p>
      <p>Immediately after its inception, Anslinger tried to get the FBN
        involved in the drafting process of the AMA Bill, the Uniform
        Narcotic Drug Act. His belated interference was resented by some
        of the parties involved, and welcomed by others. Unidentified
        vested interests were stirring up trouble among the physicians
        and pharmacists. Some persons went on record with unqualified
        complaints. In particular, the prominent AMA member Dr William
        White asked AMA president Dr Olin West to hold a conference with
        all the leaders of the pharmaceutical industry and a "high
        official" of the AMA --- but not Dr Woodward: <br>
        "The reason for suggesting someone other than Dr Woodward is to
        relieve the situation of a condition which has arisen because of
        his hard labor and intimate association with this problem from
        the beginning". (1 July 1932) </p>
      <p>Dr West replied (8 July 1932): "Frankly I am somewhat surprised
        at some of the statements offered in your letter with respect to
        the attitude of Dr Woodward concerning some phases of the
        proposed legislation for control of narcotics... </p>
      <p>"I happen to know that Dr Woodward has done a great deal of
        arduous work in an effort to be helpful in drafting ‘A Uniform
        State Law’ and I feel very sure that it has not been his
        intention to antagonize other organizations that are actively
        interested in this matter. In a spirit fo fairness to Dr
        Woodward, I shall as soon as possible discuss with him the
        matters referred to in your letter and I shall be glad to write
        to you again". </p>
      <p>Dr Woodward was appalled by the accusations and wrote to Dr
        White (12 July 1932): "In the first place, I resent your charge
        of ignorance and intolerance in respect to the cooperation of
        manufacturing chemists, pharmacists, pharmaceutical houses, and
        other groups. You suggest the importance of consulting such
        groups as if it were a bright and new idea of your own. As a
        matter of fact, they have been frequently consulted not only by
        me, but by the Council on Health and Public Instruction before I
        assumed my presnet duties with the AMA". </p>
      <p>In a letter to Anslinger (28 July 1932), E. Brookmeyer (general
        counsel for the National Association Retail Druggists) claimed
        that Woodward was trying "to limit the consideration of the
        fifth tentative draft of the AMA Bill to his Association and
        Judge Deering and his subcommittee". In truth, as Drs West and
        Woodward detailed in their responses, the pharmaceutical
        associations had declined every opportunity in the past several
        years to become involved in the drafting process of the AMA
        Bill. They even suggested that the Association actually was
        trying to block the passage of the Bill, which was to be
        presented to Congress in only two months. </p>
      <p>Smelling a conspiracy, Dr Woodward complained about the
        situation in a letter to Anslinger (30 July 1932): </p>
      <p>"In any event, the criticism of my course is so widespread and
        has reached such high places that I have no doubt whatsoever
        that it has been deliberately promoted to serve the ulterior
        purpose of some interest that is unwilling to be known in
        connection with the matter". </p>
      <p>Assistant Surgeon General Treadway saw the "need to remedy a
        situation which was getting somewhat out of hand". He advised Dr
        West of the FBN’s views, which were neutral in this instance,
        and invited the bureau to participate in the meeting proposed by
        Dr White. A conference was held with representatives from the
        Deering Committee, Department of State, AMA, Public Health
        Service, FBN, and pharmaceutical and health professions and
        industries. The final draft of the AMA Bill was agreed upon for
        presentation to the National Conference of State Commissioners
        on October 8. The industrial interests considered the
        prohibition of cannabis to be untenable, and E. Brookmeyer, the
        counsel of the National Association of Retail Druggists, said so
        in no uncertain terms: </p>
      <p>"Strike the cannabis section. Section 12. This section should
        not be incorporated in this draft at all as the abuse complained
        of is altogether local and limited to extremely narrow
        territory". </p>
      <p>Section 12 was eventually eliminated from the Act. </p>
      <p>The national Conference of Commissioners on the Uniform Drug
        Act met in October 1932 and adopted the fifth draft of the AMA
        Bill, but the optional provision for cannabis defined the plant
        as a "narcotic" in all states, technically equivalent to opium,
        and subject to the same draconian penalties. </p>
      <p>Anslinger immediately directed his 300 FBN agents to assist the
        sponsors of the Uniform Act by lobbying the state legislatures
        to enact the proposed law. They also conducted a relentless
        campaign to enlist public support. But the objections to the Act
        proved to be a formidable obstacle that could not be overcome.
        The potential costs and paperwork were excessive, and there were
        many misunderstandings of the Act’s requirements. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;In a speech about "The Need for Narcotic Education" made
        over NBC radio (24 February 1933), Anslinger declared: </p>
      <p>"Another urgent reason for the early enactment of the Uniform
        State Narcotic Act is to be found in the fact that it is the
        only uniform legislation yet devised to effectively deal with
        Marihuana" </p>
      <p>"There is no Federal law against the prohibition and use of
        Marihuana in this country. The legal fight against its abuse is
        largely a problem of state and municipal legislation and law
        enforcement. </p>
      <p>"All public-spirited citizens should enlist in the campaign to
        demand and to get adequate state laws and efficient state
        enforcement on Marihuana". </p>
      <p>The annual FBN report for 1932 stated: </p>
      <p>"This abuse of the drug is noted among the Latin-American or
        Spanish-speaking population. The sale of cannabis cigarettes
        occurs to a considerable degree in the States along the Mexican
        border and in cities of the Southwest and West, as well as in
        New York City, and, in fact, wherever there are settlements of
        Latin Americans. </p>
      <p>A great deal of public interest has been aroused by newspaper
        articles appearing from time to time on the evils of the abuse
        of marijuana or Indian hemp, and more attention has been focused
        upon specific cases reported of the abuse of the drug than would
        otherwise have been the case. This publicity tends to magnify
        the extent of the evil and lends color to an influence that
        there is an alarming spread of the improper use of the drug,
        whereas the actual increase in such use may not have been
        inordinately large".(11) </p>
      <p>In the Bureau’s report for 1933, Anslinger modestly praised the
        success of his publicity campaign against cannabis on behalf of
        the Uniform Act: </p>
      <p>"Articles were prepared in the FBN, at the request of a number
        of organizations dealing with this general subject for
        publication by such organizations in magazines and newspapers.
        An intelligent an sympathetic public interest, helpful to the
        administration of the narcotic laws has been aroused and
        maintained". </p>
      <p>The Women’s Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) was most
        sympathetic and cooperative with the FBN, and dutifully
        published everything said or written about marijuana by
        Anslinger and others in their organ, the <i>Union Signal</i>. I
        October 1934, for example, the <i>Signal</i> printed this
        tidbit: </p>
      <p>"Marihuana-smoking at women’s bridge parties has become
        frequent, the parties usually ending up in wild carousels,
        sometimes with men joining the orgies. </p>
      <p>The appalling effects on both body and mind seem no hindrance
        to its increase of consumption, particularly in the states where
        there is a large Spanish-American population, says a recent item
        in the New York Times. In Western and Southwestern states, it is
        being sold more or less openly in pool halls and beer gardens
        and, according to some authorities, is being peddled to school
        children". </p>
      <p>By 1935, however, the Uniform Act had been passed by only ten
        states. Being frustrated in his attmepts to convince legislators
        and citizens of the need for the ugly new law, Anslinger decided
        to intensify his propaganda campaign to arouse public fear of
        the "marijuana menace", thus pressuring lawmakers to take
        action. Dozens of newspapers participated in the FBN’s
        educational campaign to describe the weed and tell of its
        horrible effects. The Hearst newspaper chain reiterated its
        support of the Uniform Act and emphasized the marijuana issue in
        an editorial that appeared in several papers on September 11,
        1935: </p>
      <p>"Much of the opposition to the Uniform State Narcotic Law must
        be imputed to the selfish and often unscrupulous opposition of
        racketeering interests. </p>
      <p>"But more than half the states have not acted favorably and
        Commissioner Anslinger has announced that an intensified drive
        will be made to bring the rest into line. </p>
      <p>"One thing that the indolent legislatures should be made to
        understand is that the dope traffic does not stand still. </p>
      <p>"In recent years, the insidious and insanity-producing
        marijuana has become among the worst of all the narcotic banes,
        invading even the school houses of the country, and the Uniform
        State Narcotic Law is THE ONLY LEGISLATION yet devised to deal
        effectively with this horrid menace". </p>
      <p>In his comments on marijuana for the 1935 FBN annual report,
        Anslinger wrote: </p>
      <p>"A problem which has proved most disquieting to the Bureau
        during the year is the rapid development of a widespread traffic
        in Indian hemp, or marihuana, throughout the country... </p>
      <p>"In the absence of Federal legislature on the subject, the
        States and cities should rightfully assume the responsibility
        for providing vigorous measures for the extinction of this
        lethal weed, and it is therefore hoped that all public-spirited
        citizens will earnestly enlist in movement urged by the Treasury
        Department to adjure intensified enforcement of marihuana laws".
      </p>
      <p>In the FBN report for 1936, Anslinger made these assertions: </p>
      <p>"The rapid development during the past several years,
        particularly during 1935 and 1936, of a widespread traffic in
        cannabis, or marihuana, as it is more commonly known in the
        United States, is regarded with much concern by the Bureau of
        narcotics. Ten years ago there was little traffic in this drug
        except in parts of the Southwest. The weed now grows wild in
        almost every state in the Union, is easily obtainable, and has
        come into wide abuse.. </p>
      <p>"In the absence of additional Federal legislature the FBN can
        therefore carry no war of its own against this traffic... The
        drug has come into wide and increasing abuse in many states, and
        the FBN has therefore been endeavoring to impress upon the
        various States the urgent need for vigorous enforcement of local
        cannabis laws". </p>
      <p>In February 1936, the <i>Union Signal</i> faithfully reported
        Anslinger’s estimate that fully "50% of the violent crimes
        committed in districts occupied by Mexicans, Greeks, Turks.
        Filipinos, Spaniards, Latin Americans, and Negroes may be traced
        to the use of marijuana". </p>
      <p>Attorney Rex Stewart wrote an article, printed in the <i>Union
          Signal</i> issue of September 19, 1936, that stated: </p>
      <p>"A man is dangerous after a whiff or two of marihuana. He
        doesn’t need to smoke an entire cigarette. A few sucking puffs
        are enough to give him the heart of a lion and make him as
        resilient to punishment as a rubber ball. He will commit any
        crime if he is mentally so inclined, and he will take chances he
        would not dare normally". </p>
      <p>The prestigious and extremist World Narcotic Defense
        Association was duly impressed and enlisted in the service of
        Anslinger’s cause. In 1936 the WNDA and its sister organization,
        the International Narcotic Education Association, published a
        pamphlet about "Marihuana or Indian Hemp and Its Preparation",
        in which their gross exaggeration of the situation was raised to
        new heights of absurdity: </p>
      <p>"The narcotic content in Marihuana decreases the rate of heart
        beat and causes irregularity of the pulse. Death may result from
        the effect on the heart. </p>
      <p>Prolonged use of Marihuana frequently develops a delirious rage
        which sometimes leads to high crimes, such as assault and
        murder. Hence Marihuana has been called the ‘killer drug’. The
        habitual use of this narcotic poison always caused a very marked
        mental deterioration and sometimes produces insanity. Hence
        Marihuana is frequently called ‘loco weed’ (loco is the Spanish
        word for crazy). </p>
      <p>"While the Marihuana habit leads to physical wreckage and
        mental decay, its effects upon character and morality are even
        more devastating. The victim frequently undergoes such moral
        degeneracy that he will lie and steal without scruple; he
        becomes utterly untrustworthy and often drifts into the
        underworld where, with his degenerate companions, he commits
        high crimes and misdemeanors. Marihuana sometimes gives man the
        lust to kill, unreasonably and without motive. Many cases of
        assault, rape, robbery, and murder are traced to the use of
        Marihuana." </p>
      <p>The Hearst newspapers also endorsed the WNDA, and urged readers
        to "Protect Youth Against Dope": </p>
      <p>"The Hearst newspapers, which have crusaded unceasingly against
        the NARCOTIC EVIL in all its vicious forms, are gratified to
        know that Narcotic Education Week is centering its attention
        upon the MARIHUANA PROBLEM. </p>
      <p>"Legal authorities, while increasingly vigilant against other
        habit-forming drugs, have permitted the marihuana cigarette to
        become a NATIONAL MENACE. </p>
      <p>"One of the consequences, according to Ethel Chiller,
        sociologist of the Chicago Womens’ Court, is that SIXTY PER CENT
        of all juvenile delinquents are victims of the drug. </p>
      <p>"Admiral Richard P. Hobson, President of the World Narcotic
        Defense Association, says: </p>
      <p>"The warfare on the dope ring has made much progress. At the
        same time the enemy has developed a very dangerous new field,
        the exploitation of marihuana cigarettes, which is especially
        menacing and destructive for our youth. </p>
      <p>"The marihuana cigarette is one of the most INSIDIOUS of all
        forms of dope, largely because of the failure of the public to
        understand its fatal qualities. </p>
      <p>"The nation is almost defenseless against it, having no Federal
        laws to cope with it and virtually no organized campaign for
        combating it. </p>
      <p>The result is tragic. </p>
      <p>"High school boys and girls buy the destructive weed without
        knowledge of its capacity for harm, and conscienceless dealers
        sell it with impunity. </p>
      <p>"This is a NATIONAL PROBLEM, and it must have national
        attention. </p>
      <p>"The fatal marihuana cigarette must recognized as a DEADLY DRUG
        and American children must be PROTECTED AGAINST IT." </p>
      <p>Anslinger’s army included other groups such as the Federation
        of Women’s Clubs, the National Parent Teachers Association, the
        Young Women’s Christian Association, and the National Council of
        Catholic Men and Women. The following excerpt from Anslinger’s
        letter of March 1, 1935 to Rev. John Burke, the general
        secretary of the National Catholic Welfare Council, is typical
        of his attempts to enlist the support of such organizations: </p>
      <p>"The Act has been and is being opposed in some of the
        legislatures in session this year by certain ‘groups’ who wage
        their campaigns under cover. These cliques think that their
        interest may be negatived by passage of this legislation. Many
        of the legislatures in session this year will not convene again
        until 1937. It is, therefore, of the greatest importance to
        concentrate activities in these commonwealths now. There is no
        more important or far-reaching problem affecting health and
        morals before the world today that that of narcotic drug
        control. </p>
      <p>"Within the past three years there has been an alarming an
        almost unbelievable spread of the use of Marihuana, known
        botanically as cannabis. A cigaret is compounded from the dried,
        flowering pistillate tops of Marihuana or Indian hemp, and sold
        illicitly and insidiously by peddlers to adolescent youths,
        children in high and grammar school grades. This statement is
        not exaggerated but is unfortunately true, as the Bureau has
        legal proof of such malpractice. </p>
      <p>"When an opium or cocaine habitue has been made, it is
        extremely difficult to effect a cure, although this has been
        done by scientific medical hospitalization. The case of
        Marihuana addicts is well nigh hopeless as the Hasheesh or
        Marihuana smoker becomes insane. Favorable action must be taken
        to prevent the spread of this pernicious weed because its evil
        consequences are irremediable. </p>
      <p>"In behalf of the intensive campaign which we are waging for
        the adoption of the Uniform Narcotic Drug Act in the 35 state
        legislatures, I respectfully request the endorsement of the
        National Catholic Welfare Councils of Men and Women for this
        necessary and vital legislation". </p>
      <p>As the FBN media campaign reached a peak of frenzy, no
        statement was too ridiculous to be printed or said. The
        situation is exemplified by Anslinger’s comment published in
        Hearst’s <i>Washington Herald</i> (12 April 1937): </p>
      <p>"If the hideous monster Frankenstein came face to face with the
        monster Marihuana, he would drop dead of fright." </p>
      <p>William Hearst provided many of the fantastic stories that
        Anslinger used to enhance the articles he authored. The classic
        "Marihuana: Assassin of Youth" that appeared in <i>American
          Magazine</i> (July 1937), began with a grisly scene that never
        occurred: </p>
      <p>"The sprawled body of a young girl lay crushed on the sidewalk
        the other day after a plunge from the fifth story of a Chicago
        apartment house. Everyone called it a suicide but actually it
        was murder. The killer was a narcotic known to America as
        marihuana, and history as hashish. It is a narcotic used in the
        form of cigarettes, comparatively new to the United States and
        as dangerous as a coiled rattlesnake! </p>
      <p>"An entire family was murdered by a youthful addict in Florida.
        When officers arrived at the home they found the youth
        staggering about in a human slaughterhouse. With an ax he had
        killed his father, mother, two brothers, and a sister. He seemed
        to be in a daze. He had no recollection of having committed the
        multiple crimes. The officers knew him ordinarily as a sane,
        rather quiet young man; now he was pitifully crazed. They sought
        the reason. The boy said he had been in the habit of smoking
        something which youthful friends called 'muggles', a childish
        name for marihuana. </p>
      <p>"That youth has been selected by the peddlers of this poison as
        an especially fertile field makes it a problem of serious
        concern to every man and woman in America! </p>
      <p>"Addicts may often develop a delirious rage during which they
        are temporarily and violently insane. This insanity may take the
        form of a desire for self-destruction or a persecution complex
        to be satisfied only by the commission of some heinous crime."
        (12) </p>
      <p>The FBN received over 50 letters addressed to Anslinger stating
        that "Your article was the first time I ever heard of
        marihuana", and similar edified comments.&nbsp; Courtney Cooper,
        who was Anslinger's co-author, elaborated on the theme in his
        book, <i>Here's to Crime</i>: </p>
      <p>"There is only one end for the confirmed marihuana smoker, and
        that is insanity. Therefore, it might be of interest to know
        that one of the main selling places of marihuana in the United
        States is in the vicinity of high schools! </p>
      <p>"The use of marihuana has spread within the last few years so
        rapidly as to constitute a menace that should receive the
        attention of every thinking parent in America! </p>
      <p>"Apartments are run by ghoul-minded women; in such apartments
        high school students gather on the promise that reefer-smoking
        will put music in their souls and a release from all moral
        restraints; nothing is said about eventual insanity. </p>
      <p>"Then suddenly a girl wanted to dance. Immediately everyone
        wanted to dance. The movements were of sinuosity. After a time,
        girls began to pull off their clothes. Men weaved naked over
        them; soon the entire room was one of the wildest sexuality.
        Ordinary intercourse and several forms of perversion were going
        on all at once, girl to girl, man to man, woman to woman. </p>
      <p>"This is one of the great reasons why girls who are little more
        than children are now being placed in whorehouses by members of
        prostitution syndicates, why young boys of otherwise straight
        habits suddenly join up with dangerous gangs, why there are
        constantly more murders committed by youth." (13) </p>
      <p>In his book <i>The Murderers</i> (1961), Anslinger gave a
        belated description of a 1930s "tea-pad": </p>
      <p>"One adolescent gave a picture to an agent of a typical
        'smoker' in an apartment or 'pad': </p>
      <p>"The room was crowded. There were fifty people but it seemed
        like five hundred. It was like crazy, couples lying all over the
        place, a woman was screaming out in the hall, two fellows were
        trying to make love to the same girl and this girl was screaming
        and crying and not making any sense. Her clothes were mostly
        pulled off and she was snickering and blubbering and trying to
        push these two guys away... The place was nothing but smoke and
        stink and these funny little noises I could hear but they were
        way out, so far that I could hardly hear them and they were
        right there in the room, that laughing and crying and the music
        and all that stuff. It was crazy wild. But I didn't want to do
        anything, I didn't want to sleep with those women or like that.
        I just wanted to lie down because the room seemed so big and
        like a great tremendous crowd like at a ball game or something.
      </p>
      <p>"Much of the most irrational juvenile violence and killing that
        has written a new chapter of shame and tragedy is traceable
        directly to this hemp intoxification. A gang of boys tear the
        clothes from two schoolgirls and rape the screaming girls, one
        boy after another. A sixteen-year-old kills his entire family of
        five in Florida, a man in Minnesota puts a bullet through the
        head of a stranger on the road; in Colorado a husband tries to
        shoot his wife, kills her grandmother instead and then kills
        himself. Every one of these crimes had been proceeded [sic] by
        the smoking of one or more marijuana reefer. </p>
      <p>"As the marijuana situation grew worse, I knew action had to be
        taken to get proper control legislation passed. By 1937, under
        my direction, the Bureau launched two important steps: First, a
        legislative plan to seek from Congress a new law that would
        place marijuana and its distribution directly under federal
        control. Second, on radio and at major forums, such as that
        presented annually by the <i>New York Herald Tribune</i>, I
        told the story of this evil weed of the fields and riverbeds and
        roadsides. I wrote articles for magazines; our agents gave
        hundreds of lectures to parents, educators, social and civic
        leaders. In network broadcasts I reported on the growing list of
        crimes, including murder and rape. I described the nature of
        marihuana and its close kinship to hashish. I continued to
        hammer at the facts. </p>
      <p>"I believe we did a thorough, for the public was alerted, and
        the laws to protect them were passed, both nationally and at the
        state level. We also brought under control the wild-growing
        marijuana in this country. Working with local authorities, we
        cleaned up hundreds of acres of marijuana weed and uprooted
        plants sprouting along the roadsides. </p>
      <p>"There were still some WPA gangs working in those days and we
        put them to good use. Just outside the nation's capital, for
        some sixty miles along the Potomac River, on both banks,
        marijuana was growing in profusion; it had been planted there
        originally by early settlers who made their own hemp and cloth.
        The workers cleaned out tremendous riverbank crops, destroying
        plants, seeds and roots. All through the Midwest also, WPA
        workers were used for this clean-up job. The wild hemp was
        rooted out o America." (14) </p>
      <p>In <i>The Traffic in Narcotics</i>, co-authored with William
        Tompkins, Anslinger persisted in making absurd declarations: </p>
      <p>"A further distinction between the opiates and marihuana has
        been touched on before but bears repeating. While opium can be a
        blessing or a curse, depending on its use, marihuana is only and
        always a scourge which undermines its victims and degrades them
        mentally, morally, and physically. </p>
      <p>"Medical experts agree on the complete unpredictability of the
        effect of marihuana on different individuals. A small dose taken
        by one subject may bring about intense intoxification, raving
        fits, criminal assaults. Another subject can consume large
        amounts without experiencing any reaction except stupefaction.
        It is this unpredictable effect&nbsp; which makes marihuana one
        of the most dangerous drugs known. </p>
      <p>"Marihuana sharpens the sensibilities, and in this stage the
        addict is prone to suggestion, violent or otherwise. The intense
        overexcitement of the nerves and emotions leads to
        uncontrollable irritability and violent and irresponsible acts
        due to irresistible impulses of suggestive origin. The last
        stage might include hallucinations, varied and often terrifying.
        Restless, accompanied by bizarre phantasmagoria, then overcomes
        the victim. </p>
      <p>"In the earliest stages of intoxification the will power is
        destroyed and inhibitions and restraints are released; the moral
        barricades are broken down and often debauchery and sexuality
        results. Where mental instability is inherent, the behavior is
        generally violent. An egotist will enjoy delusions of grandeur,
        the timid individual will suffer anxiety, and the aggressive one
        often will resort to acts of violence of crime. Dormant
        tendencies are released and while the subject may know what is
        happening, he has become powerless to prevent it. Constant use
        produces an incapacity for work and a disorientation of purpose.
        The drug has a corroding effect on the body and on the mind,
        weakening the entire physical system and often leading to
        insanity after prolonged use." </p>
      <p>One case cited by Anslinger concerned "O.J.", who confessed to
        the murder of a friend "while under the influence of marihuana".
        Dr Walter Bromberg of the New York County Court of General
        Sessions' Psychiatric Clinic reported on the case in the <i>Journal




          of the American Medical Association</i> in 1939, and confirmed
        that O.J. had indeed murdered his friend and stuffed the corpse
        into a trunk. According to Dr Bromberg's report, "O.J was
        examined in this clinic…Although he was a psychopathic liar and
        possibly homosexual, there was no indication in the examination
        or history of any use of any drug. The investigation by the
        probation department failed to indicate the use of the drug
        marijuana". In 1966, Dr James Munch, who was a member of the
        Advisory Committee of the Bureau of Narcotics, resurrected the
        lie in an article published in the United Nations Bulletin on
        narcotics, and embellished it with a quotation attributed to
        O.J.: </p>
      <p>"I was fearless after smoking marijuana cigarettes but would
        not have done this without marijuana." </p>
      <p>Researchers who have carefully investigated Anslinger's
        collection of gore stories have determined that few if any were
        in fact true. (15) </p>
      <p>According to crusader Earle Rowell, author of the hysterical
        diatribe <i>On The Trail of Marihuana, The Weed of Madness</i>
        (1939), dope pushers used this cheap trick to seduce innocent
        youths into smoking marijuana: </p>
      <p>"One of the methods used in making marihuana users is for the
        peddler, with an unlighted marihuana cigarette in his hand, to
        step up to a high school boy or girl who is smoking a tobacco
        cigarette and say, 'Give me a light, I haven't a match'.
        Forthwith the peddler extends a hand filled with marihuanas, and
        says persuasively; 'Try one of my cigarettes. They are a new
        special kind; got a real kick in 'em. You'll like 'em. Take two
        or three'! </p>
      <p>"The baleful effects of marihuana begin soon after the first
        reefer is smoked. We know that marihuana: <br>
        1. Destroys will power, making a jellyfish of the user. He
        cannot say no. <br>
        2. Eliminates the line between right and wrong, and substitutes
        one's own warped desires or base suggestions of others as the
        standard of right. <br>
        &nbsp;3. Above all, causes crime; fills the victim with an
        irrepressible urge to violence. <br>
        &nbsp;4. Incites to revolting immoralities, including rape and
        murder. <br>
        &nbsp;5. Causes many accidents both industrial and automobile. <br>
        &nbsp;6. Ruins careers forever. <br>
        &nbsp;7. Causes insanity as its specialty. <br>
        &nbsp;8. Either in self-defense or as a means of revenue, users
        make smokers of others, thus perpetuating evil." </p>
      <p><b>(6) The Marihuana Tax Act ~</b><a name="mtaxact"></a> </p>
      <p>By 1936, public concern over marijuana had been increased and
        agitated to the extent that state officials were asking for
        federal assistance. A letter to the FBN from the editor of the
        Daily Courier (Alamosa, CO) was typical of the fear, ignorance
        and racism surrounding the situation: </p>
      <p>"Is there any assistance your Bureau can give us in handling
        this drug? Can you suggest something? Can you enlarge your
        Department to deal with marijuana? Can you do anything to help
        us? </p>
      <p>"I wish you could see what a small cigarette can do to one of
        our degenerate Spanish-speaking residents. That's why our
        problem is so great: the greatest percentage of our population
        is composed of Spanish-speaking persons, most of whom are low
        mentally, because of social and racial conditions. </p>
      <p>"While marijuana has figured in the greatest number of crimes
        in the past few years, officials fear it, not for what it has
        done, but for what it is capable of doing. They want to check it
        before an outbreak does occur. </p>
      <p>"Through representatives of civic leaders and law officers of
        the San Luis Valley, I have been asked to write to you for
        help." </p>
      <p>Local law enforcement agencies also appealed to their state
        governors, who pressured Henry Morgenthau Jr, the Secretary of
        the Treasury, to take action. He in turn assigned the Treasury's
        General Counsel, Herman Oliphant, to draft appropriate
        legislation. Oliphant was unable to find a suitable
        constitutional basis for the prohibition of hemp. Eventually he
        chose to use the models of the Harrison Narcotics Act and the
        national Firearms Act, which imposed a prohibitive "transfer
        tax" on the sale of machine guns. The Firearms Act was declared
        constitutional by the Supreme Court in March 1937. Oliphant then
        decided that a transfer tax could be applied successfully to
        marijuana. At first, Commissioner Anslinger thought the idea was
        absurd and doubted that Congress would accept it. In January
        1937 he met with several experts to draft a bill, but had to
        conclude in a confidential report to Stephen Gibbons, the
        Assistant Secretary of the treasury, that "under the taxing
        power and regulation of interstate commerce it would be almost
        hopeless to expect any kind of adequate control". He suggested
        instead that an international treaty be made to control the
        alleged problem: </p>
      <p>"The State Department has tentatively agreed to this
        proposition, but before action is taken we shall have to dispose
        of certain phases of legitimate traffic: for instance, the drug
        trade still has a small medical need for marijuana, but has
        agreed to eliminate entirely. The only place it is used
        extensively is by veterinarians, and we can satisfy them by
        importing their medical needs. </p>
      <p>"We must also satisfy the canary bird seed trade, and the
        Sherwin Williams Paint <br>
        Company, which uses hemp seed oil for drying purposes. We are
        now working with the Department of Commerce in finding
        substitutes for the legitimate trade, and after that is
        accomplished, the path will be cleared for the treaties and for
        federal law." </p>
      <p>Harry Anslinger and Stuart Fuller of the State Department were
        permitted to present the idea of a treaty to control cannabis at
        the Conference for the Suppression of Illicit Traffic in
        Dangerous Drugs, held in Geneva in June 1936. But their proposal
        was rejected by the 26 other nations at the conference, so
        Oliphant and Anslinger continued to prepare the Marihuana Tax
        Act in secret for presentation to Congress. They gathered
        scientific and medical opinions, but studiously ignored any
        information that did not concur with their bias against hemp. </p>
      <p>For example, Assistant US Surgeon General Dr Walter Treadway
        was asked: "What are the proofs that the use of marihuana in any
        of its forms is habit-forming or addictive, and what are the
        indications and positive proofs that such addiction develops
        socially undesirable characteristics in the user?" </p>
      <p>&nbsp;He replied: "Cannabis indica does not produce dependence
        as in opium addiction. In opium addiction there is a complete
        dependence and when it is withdrawn there is actual physical
        pain which is not the case with cannabis. Alcohol more nearly
        produces the same effect as cannabis in that there is an
        excitement or a general feeling of lifting of personality,
        followed by a delirious stage, and subsequent narcosis. There is
        no dependence or increased tolerance such as in opium addiction.
        As to the social and moral degradation associated with cannabis,
        it probably belongs in the same category as alcohol. As with
        alcohol, it may be taken a relatively long time without social
        or emotional breakdown. Marijuana is habit-forming although not
        addicting in the same sense as alcohol might be with some
        people, or sugar, or coffee. Marijuana produces a delirium with
        a frenzy which might result in violence: but this is also true
        of alcohol." </p>
      <p>Dr Treadway was not called upon to testify in the Congressional
        hearings. The Treasury Department was not interested in educated
        opinions. Rather, Treasury attorney S.G. Tipton asked
        Commissioner Anslinger: </p>
      <p>"Have you got lots of cases on this? Horror stories --- that's
        what we want." </p>
      <p>Tipton got the stories, and he presented them with the case for
        H.R. 6385 to the House Ways and Means Committee in April 1937.
        It is thought that Herman Oliphant introduce the bill to that
        committee because it is the only one that sends bills directly
        to the House of Representatives without debate from other
        committees. Furthermore, Committee Chairman Robert Doughton (NC)
        was an ally of the DuPont dynasty, which stood to reap enormous
        profits from the suppression of cannabis. The bill was voted on
        without a roll call and passed on the Senate Committee on
        Finance, which was controlled by another ally of DuPont,
        Prentice Brown (MI). (17) </p>
      <p>Chairman Doughton called the committee to order on May 11, 1937
        "for the purpose of considering HR 6385, a bill to impose an
        occupational excise tax upon certain dealers in marijuana, to
        impose a transfer tax upon certain dealing in marijuana, and to
        safeguard the revenue therefrom by registry and recording." </p>
      <p>Clinton Hester, the Treasury Department's assistant general
        counsel, was sworn in and said: </p>
      <p>"Mr Chairman and members of the Ways and Means Committee, for
        the past two years the treasury Department has been making a
        study of the subject of marihuana, a drug which is found in the
        flowering tops, seeds, and leaves of Indian hemp, and is now
        being used extensively by high-school children in cigarettes.
        Its effect is deadly. </p>
      <p>"The leading newspapers of the United States have recognized
        the seriousness of this problem and many of them have advocated
        federal legislation to control the traffic in marihuana. In
        fact, several newspapers in the city of Washington have
        advocated such legislation. In a recent editorial, the
        Washington Times stated: </p>
      <p>"The nation is almost defenseless against it, having no Federal
        laws to cope what it and virtually no organized campaign for
        combating it. The result is tragic. School children are the prey
        of peddlers who infest school neighborhoods. High-school boys
        and girls buy the destructive weed without knowledge of its
        capacity for harm, and conscienceless dealers sell it with
        impunity. This is a national problem, and it must have national
        attention. The fatal marihuana cigarette must be recognized as a
        deadly drug and American children must be protected against it.
      </p>
      <p>"The purpose of HR 6385 is to employ the federal taxing power
        not only to raise revenue from the marihuana traffic, but also
        to discourage the current and widespread undesirable use of
        marihuana by smokers and drug addicts and thus drive the traffic
        into channels where the plant will be put to valuable
        industrial, medical and scientific uses. </p>
      <p>"Although the $100 transfer tax in this bill is intended to be
        prohibitive, as is the $200 transfer tax in the National
        Firearms Act, it is submitted that it is constitutional as a
        revenue measure." (18) </p>
      <p>Harry Anslinger also testified, and surpassed himself when he
        said: </p>
      <p>"This traffic in marihuana is increasing to such extent that it
        has become the cause for the greatest national concern. In
        medical schools the physician-to-be is taught that without opium
        medicine would be like a one-armed man. That is true, because
        you cannot get along without opium. But here is a drug that is
        not like opium. Opium has all the good of Dr Jekyll and all the
        evil of Mr Hyde. This drug is entirely the monster Hyde, the
        harmful effect of which cannot be measured!" </p>
      <p>The committee then briefly interviewed Raymond Scarlett of the
        Scarlett Corporation (Baltimore). He said: </p>
      <p>"Mr Chairman, our company handles a considerable quantity of
        hempseed annually for use in pigeon feeds. That is a necessary
        ingredient in pigeon feed because it contains an oily substance
        that is a valuable ingredient in pigeon feed, and we have not
        been able to find any seed that will take its place. If you
        substitute anything for the hemp, it has a tendency to change
        the character of the squabs produced, and if we were deprived of
        the use of hempseed, it would affect all of the pigeon producers
        in the United States, of which there are upwards of 40,000." </p>
      <p>Chairman: "Does that seed have the same effect on pigeons as
        the drug has on individuals?" </p>
      <p>Mr Snell: "I have never noticed it. It has a tendency to bring
        back the feathers and improve the birds. We are not interested
        in spreading marijuana, or anything like that. We do not want to
        be drug peddlers." </p>
      <p>The committee also heard the testimony of Dr William Woodward,
        legislative counsel of the American Medical Association. He
        opined that the proposed law was contrived, and he criticized
        every aspect of the bill, beginning with the general nature of
        the testimony offered by the FBN: </p>
      <p>"There is a certain amount of narcotic addiction of an
        objectionable character no one will deny. The newspapers have
        called attention to it so prominently that there must be some
        grounds for their statements. It has surprised me, however, that
        the facts on which these statements have been based have not
        been brought before this committee by competent primary
        evidence. We are referred to newspaper publications concerning
        the prevalence of marihuana addiction. We are told that the use
        of marihuana causes crime. </p>
      <p>"But as yet no one has been produced from the Bureau of Prisons
        to show the number of prisoners who have been found addicted to
        the marihuana habit. An informal inquiry shows that the Bureau
        of Prisons has no evidence on that point. </p>
      <p>"You have been told that school children are great users of
        marihuana cigarettes. No one has been summoned from the
        Children's Bureau to show the nature and extent of the habit
        among children. </p>
      <p>"Inquiry to the Children's Bureau shows that they have had no
        occasion to investigate it and know nothing particularly of it.
      </p>
      <p>"Inquiry to the Office of Education --- and they certainly
        should know something of the prevalence of the habit among the
        school children of the country, if it is a prevalent habit ¾
        indicates that they have had no occasion to investigate and know
        nothing of it. </p>
      <p>"Moreover, there is in the Treasury Department itself, the
        Public Health Service, with its Division of Mental Hygiene. The
        Division of Mental Hygiene was, in the first place, the Division
        of Narcotics. It was converted into the Division of mental
        Hygiene, I think, about 1930. That particular Bureau has control
        at the present time of the narcotics farms that were created
        about 1929 and 1930 and came into operation a few years later.
        No one has been summoned from that Bureau to give evidence on
        that point. </p>
      <p>"Informal inquiry by me indicates that they have no record of
        any marihuana or Cannabis addicts who have ever been committed
        to those farms. </p>
      <p>"The Bureau of the Public Health Service has also a division of
        pharmacology. If you desire evidence as to the pharmacology of
        cannabis, that obviously is the place where you can get direct
        and primary evidence, rather than the indirect hearsay
        evidence... </p>
      <p>"There is nothing in the medical use of Cannabis that has any
        relation to Cannabis addiction. I use the word 'Cannabis' in
        preference to 'marijuana', because cannabis is the correct term
        for describing the plant and its products. The term 'marijuana'
        is a mongrel word that has crept into the country over the
        Mexican border and has no general meaning, except as it relates
        to the use of Cannabis preparations for smoking. It is not
        recognized in medicine, and hardly recognized even in the
        Treasury Department. Marijuana is not the correct term. It was
        the use of the word 'marijuana' rather than the use of the term
        'Cannabis' or the use of the term 'Indian hemp' that was
        responsible, as you realized, probably, a day or two ago, for
        the failure of the dealers in Indian hempseed to connect up this
        bill with their business until rather late in the day. So I
        shall use the word 'Cannabis', and I should certainly suggest
        that if any legislation is enacted, the term used be 'Cannabis'
        and not the mongrel word 'marijuana'. </p>
      <p>"I say the medical use of Cannabis had nothing to do with
        Cannabis or marijuana addiction. In all that you have heard here
        thus far, no mention has been made of any excessive use of the
        drug by any doctor or excessive distribution by any pharmacist.
        And yet the burden of this bill is placed heavily on the doctors
        and pharmacists of the country; and I may say very heavily, most
        heavily, possibly of all, on the farmers of the country. "My
        interest is primarily, of course, in the medical aspects. We
        object to the imposing of an additional tax on physicians,
        pharmacists, and others, catering to the sick; to require that
        they register and reregister; that they have special order forms
        to be used for this particular drug, when the matter can just as
        well be covered by an amendment of the Harrison Narcotic Act. </p>
      <p>"If you are referring to the particular problem, I object to
        the act because it is utterly unsusceptible of execution, and an
        act that is not susceptible of execution is a bad thing on the
        statute books." </p>
      <p>Chairman: "If marihuana's use as a medicine has fallen off to a
        point where it is practically negligible, and if its use as a
        dope has increased until it has become serious and a menace to
        the public, as has been testified here --- and the testimony
        here has been that it causes some people to lose their mental
        balance, causes them to become criminals so that they do not
        seem to realize right from wrong after they become addicts of
        this drug --- taking into consideration the growth of its
        injurious effects and its diminuation in its use so far as any
        beneficial effect is concerned, you realize, do you not, that
        some good may be accomplished by this proposed legislation?" </p>
      <p>Dr Woodward: "Some legislation, yes, Mr Chairman." </p>
      <p>Chairman: "If that is admitted, let us get down to a few
        concrete facts. With the experience in the Bureau of Narcotics
        and with the State governments trying to enforce the laws that
        are on the State statute books against the use of this
        deleterious drug, and the Federal government has realized that
        the State laws are ineffective, don't you think some Federal
        legislation necessary?" </p>
      <p>Dr Woodward: "I do not." </p>
      <p>Chairman: "You do not?" </p>
      <p>Dr Woodward: "No. I think it is the usual tendency to ---" </p>
      <p>Chairman: "I believe you did say in response to Mr Cooper that
        you believed some legislation or some change in the present law
        would be helpful. If that be true, why have you not been here
        before this bill was introduced proposing some remedy for this
        evil?" </p>
      <p>Dr Woodward: "Mr Chairman, I have visited the Commissioner of
        Narcotics on various occasions&nbsp; ---" </p>
      <p>Chairman: "That is not an answer to my question at all." </p>
      <p>Dr Woodward: "I have not been here because ---" </p>
      <p>Chairman: "You are here representing the medical association.
        If your association has realized the necessity, the importance
        of some legislation ¾ which you now admit --- why did you wait
        until this bill was introduced to come here and make mention of
        it? Why did you not come here voluntarily and suggest to this
        committee some legislation?" </p>
      <p>Dr Woodward: "I have talked these matters over many times with
        the --- " </p>
      <p>Chairman: "That does not do us any good, to talk this matter
        over. I have talked over a lot of things. The states do not seem
        to be able to deal with it effectively, nor is the Federal
        government dealing with it at all. Why do you wait until now and
        then come in here and oppose something that is presented to us.
        You propose nothing whatever to correct the evil that exists.
        Now, I do not like to have a round-about answer to that
        question." </p>
      <p>Dr Woodward: "We do not propose legislation directly to
        Congress when the same end can be reached through one of the
        executive departments of the government." </p>
      <p>Chairman: "You admit that it has not been done. You said that
        you thought some legislation would be helpful. That is why I am
        trying to hold you down to. Now, why have you not proposed any
        legislation? That is what I want a definite, clear-cut answer
        to." </p>
      <p>Dr Woodward: "In the first place, it is not a medical addiction
        that is involved and the data do not come before the medical
        society. You may absolutely forbid the use of Cannabis by any
        physician, disposition of Cannabis by any pharmacist in the
        country, and you would not have touched your Cannabis addiction
        as it stands today, because there is no relation between it and
        the practice of medicine or pharmacy. It is entirely outside of
        the practice of those two branches." </p>
      <p>Chairman: "If the statement that you have just made has any
        relation to the question that I asked, I just do not have the
        mind to understand it; I am sorry." </p>
      <p>Dr Woodward: "I say that we do not ordinarily come directly to
        Congress if a department can take care of the matter. I have
        talked with the Commissioner, with Commissioner Anslinger." </p>
      <p>Chairman: "If you want to advise us on legislation, you ought
        to come here with some constructive proposals, rather than
        criticism, rather than trying to throw obstacles in the way of
        something that the Federal government is trying to do. It has
        not only an unselfish motive in this, but they have a serious
        responsibility." </p>
      <p>Dr Woodward: "We cannot understand yet, Mr Chairman, why this
        bill should have been prepared in secret for two years without
        any limitation, even to the profession, that it was being
        prepared." </p>
      <p>Chairman: "Is not the fact that you were not consulted your
        real objection to this bill?" </p>
      <p>Dr Woodward: "Not at all." </p>
      <p>Chairman: "Just because you were not consulted?" </p>
      <p>Dr Woodward: "Not at all." </p>
      <p>Chairman: "No matter how much good there was in the proposal?"
      </p>
      <p>Dr Woodward: "Not at all." </p>
      <p>Chairman: "That is not it?" </p>
      <p>Dr Woodward: "Not at all. We always try to be helpful." </p>
      <p>Mr Vinson: "The fact that they took that length of time in the
        preparation of the bill, what has that to do with the merits of
        the legislation?" </p>
      <p>Dr Woodward: "The legislation is impracticable so far as
        enforcement is concerned, and the same study devoted to state
        legislation with 44 state legislatures in session this year
        would have produced much better results." </p>
      <p>The committee continued to harass and harangue Dr Woodward,
        interrupting his statements, diverting the issue to
        inconsequential minor points and indulging in ad hominem insults
        until they dismissed him and took a recess. </p>
      <p>Commissioner Anslinger brought with him his close friend Dr
        James Munch, a pharmacologist from Temple University whose
        expertise consisted of limited experiments with cannabis and
        dogs, and hearsay about its effects upon humans: </p>
      <p>Dr Munch: "Continuous use will tend to cause the degeneration
        of one part of the brain, that part that is useful for higher or
        physic [sic] reasoning, or the memory. Functions of that type
        are localized in the cerebral cortex of the brain. Those are the
        disturbing and harmful effects that follow continued exposure to
        marihuana." </p>
      <p>Mr McCormack: "Can you give us any idea as to the period of
        continued use that occurs before this disintegration takes
        place?" </p>
      <p>Dr Munch: "I can only speak from my knowledge of animals. In
        some animals we see the effect after about three months, while
        in others it requires more than a year, when they are given the
        same dose." </p>
      <p>Mr McCormack: "Are there not some animals on which it reacted,
        as I understand it, in a manner similar to its reaction on human
        beings? Is that right? </p>
      <p>Dr Munch: "Yes, sir." </p>
      <p>Mr McCormack: "Have you experimented upon any animals whose
        reaction to this drug closely resembles the reaction of human
        beings?" </p>
      <p>Dr Munch: "The reason we use dogs is because the reaction of
        dogs to this drug closely resembles the reaction of human
        beings." </p>
      <p>Mr McCormack: "And the continued use of it, as you have
        observed the reaction on dogs, has resulted in the
        disintegration of personality?" </p>
      <p>Dr Munch: "Yes. So far as I can tell, not being a dog
        psychologist, the effects will develop in from three months to a
        year." </p>
      <p>The FBN did not see fit to present any other "scientific"
        information about cannabis. Instead, the Bureau dismissed all
        such considerations in a sweeping written statement that focused
        on the mythical dangers of hemp: </p>
      <p>"Despite the fact that medical men and scientists have
        disagreed upon the harmfulness of this drug, the records offer
        ample evidence that it has a disastrous effect upon many of its
        users. Recently we have received many reports showing crimes of
        violence committed by persons while under the influence of
        marihuana. </p>
      <p>"The deleterious, even vicious, qualities of the drug render it
        highly dangerous to the mind and body upon which it operates to
        destroy the will, cause one to lose the power of connected
        thought, producing imaginary delectable situations and gradually
        weakening the physical powers. Its use frequently leads to
        insanity." </p>
      <p>Ralph Loziers, the general counsel of the National Oil Seed
        Institute, was one of the few dissenting voices at the House
        hearings: </p>
      <p>"Respectable authorities tell us that in the Orient, at least
        200 million people use this drug --- and when we take into
        consideration that for hundreds, yes, thousands of years,
        practically that number of people have been using this drug ---
        it is significant that in Asia and elsewhere in the Orient,
        where poverty stalks abroad on every hand and where thye draw on
        all the plant resources which a bountiful nature has given that
        domain, it is significant that none of these 200 million people
        has ever, since the dawn of civilization, has been found using
        the seed of this plant or using the oil as a drug. </p>
      <p>"Now, if there were any deleterious properties or principles in
        the seed or oil, it is reasonable to suppose that these
        Orientals, who have been reaching out in their poverty for
        something that would satisfy their morbid appetite, would have
        discovered it... </p>
      <p>"If the committee please, the hemp seed, or seed of the
        cannabis sativa l., is used in all the Oriental nations and also
        in a part of Russia as food. It is grown in their fields and
        used as oatmeal. Millions of people every day are using hemp
        seed in the Orient as food. They have been doing that for many
        generations, especially in periods of famine... </p>
      <p>"The point I make is this: that this bill is too all-inclusive.
        This bill is a world-encircling measure. This bill brings the
        activities ¾ the crushing of this great industry --- under the
        supervision of a bureau, which may mean its supervision. Last
        year, there was imported into the U.S. 62,813,000 pounds of hemp
        seeds. In 1935 there was imported 116 million pounds..." </p>
      <p>The report of the Ways and means Committee affirmed all the
        charges in the case against cannabis: </p>
      <p>"Under the influence of this drug the will is destroyed and all
        power o directing and controlling thought is lost. Inhibitions
        are released. As a result of these effects, it appeared from
        testimony produced at the hearing that many violent crimes have
        been and are being committed by persons under the influence of
        this drug. Not only is marihuana used by hardened criminals to
        steel them to commit violent crimes, but it is also being placed
        in the hands of high-school children in the form of marihuana
        cigarettes by unscrupulous peddlers. Cases were cited at the
        hearing of school children who have been driven to crime and
        insanity through the use of this drug. Its continued use results
        many times in impotence and insanity." </p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the Journal of the American Medical Association
        published a strong editorial in belated response against the
        proposed federal law in the issue for May 1, 1937: </p>
      <p>"The medical profession today seldom dispenses the drug. Many
        physicians will, however, probably feel it necessary to preserve
        their right to use it if and when circumstances make it
        advisable to do so and accordingly will feel compelled to pay
        the tax. Pharmacists presumably will seldom have calls for
        cannabis, but they must nevertheless be prepared to dispense it
        when a call does come, so they will have to pay the tax. The
        million dollars to be collected annually by the federal
        government will no doubt be charged as a part of practicing
        medicine, dentistry, and pharmacy. So also will the expense of
        record keeping and reporting, called for under the bill. All
        this will be in the end paid for by the patient and thus will go
        to swell the cost of sickness. Thus the sick and injured must
        contribute toward efforts to suppress a habit that has little or
        no relation to the use o cannabis for medical purposes and that
        is already within the jurisdiction of the several states... </p>
      <p>"After more than twenty years of federal effort and the
        expenditure of millions of dollars, the opium and cocaine habits
        are still widespread. The best efforts of an efficient bureau of
        narcotics, supplemented by the efforts of an equally efficient
        bureau of customs, have failed to stop the unlawful flow of
        opium and coca leaves and their compounds and derivatives, on
        which the continuance and spread of narcotic addiction depends.
        The best efforts of the Public Health Service to find means for
        the prevention and cure of narcotic addiction have not yet
        accomplished that end. Two federal narcotic farms, operating
        under the supervision and control of the U.S. Public Health
        Service, cannot guarantee the cure of narcotic addiction. What
        reason is there, then, for believing that any better results can
        be obtained by direct federal efforts to suppress a habit
        arising out of the misuse of such a drug as cannabis? Certainly
        it is almost as easy to smuggle into the country and to
        distribute as are opium and coca leaves. Moreover it can be
        cultivated in many parts of the United States and grows wild in
        field and forest and along the highways in many places…" (19) </p>
      <p>The bill came before the full House on June 14, 1937.
        Congressman Snell objected to the lateness of the hour and
        confessed his ignorance of the subject: </p>
      <p>Mr Doughton: "I ask the unanimous consent for the present
        consideration of the bill to impose an occupational excise tax
        upon certain dealers in marihuana, to impose a transfer tax upon
        certain dealings in marihuana, and to safeguard the revenue
        therefrom by registry and recording." </p>
      <p>The clerk read the rest of the bill. </p>
      <p>Mr Snell: "Mr Speaker, reserving the right to object, and
        notwithstanding the fact that my friend, Reed, is in favor of
        it, is this a matter we should bring up at this late hour of the
        afternoon? I do not know anything about the bill. It may be all
        right and it may be that everyone is for it, but as a general
        principle, I am against bring up any important legislation, and
        I suppose this is important, since it comes from the Ways and
        Means Committee, at this late hour of the day." </p>
      <p>Mr Rayburn: "Mr Speaker, if the gentleman will yield, I may say
        that the gentleman from North Carolina has stated to me that
        this bill has a unanimous report from the committee and that
        there is no controversy about it." </p>
      <p>Mr Snell: "What is the bill?" </p>
      <p>Mr Rayburn: "It has something to do with something that is
        called marihuana. I believe it is a narcotic of some kind." </p>
      <p>Mr Vinson: "Marihuana is the same as hashish." </p>
      <p>Mr Snell: "Mr Speaker, I am not going to object but I think it
        is wrong to consider legislation of this character at this time
        of night." </p>
      <p>Only four representatives asked for an explanation of the bill.
        Instead of a straight answer, a member of the Ways and means
        Committee gave them an account of criminal acts allegedly
        perpetrated by the use of marijuana. The act passed through the
        House without argument and was forwarded to the Senate Committee
        on Finance. The subcommittee hearing was held on July 12. </p>
      <p>Clinton Hester, the Assistant General Counsel of the treasury
        Department, introduced the bill: </p>
      <p>"The purpose, Mr Chairman, of HR 6906 is to employ the Federal
        taxing power to raise revenue by imposing occupational and
        transfer taxes upon dealings in marihuana and to discourage the
        widespread use of the drug by smokers and drug addicts. </p>
      <p>"The flowering tops, leaves and seeds of the hemp plant contain
        a dangerous drug known as marihuana. The drug is used only to a
        negligible extent by the medical profession because the effect
        of the drug is so variable that a physician cannot tell how his
        patient will react to the drug and because there are so many
        better substitutes. </p>
      <p>"The plant also has many industrial uses. From the mature
        stalk, fiber is produced which in turn is manufactured into
        twine, and other fiber products. From the seeds, oil is
        extracted which is used in the manufacture of such products as
        paint, varnish, linoleum, and soap. From hempseed cake, the
        residue of the seed after the oil has been extracted, cattle
        feed and fertilizer are manufactured. In addition the seed is
        used as special feed for pigeons. </p>
      <p>"Marihuana is also used illicitly by smoking it in crudely
        prepared cigarettes, which are readily procurable in almost all
        parts of the country at prices ranging from 10 to 25 cents each.
        Under the influence of this drug the will is destroyed and all
        power of directing and controlling thought is lost...
        Inhibitions are released. As a result of these effects, many
        violent crimes have been and are being committed by persons
        under the influence of this drug. Not only is marihuana used by
        hardened criminals to steel them to commit violent crimes, but
        it is also being placed in the hands of high-school children in
        the form o marihuana cigarettes by unscrupulous peddlers. Its
        continued use results many times in impotency and insanity. </p>
      <p>"Two objectives have dictated the form of HR 6906, first, the
        development of a plan of taxation which will raise revenue and
        at the same time render extremely difficult the acquisition of
        an adequate means of publicizing dealings in marihuana in order
        to tax and control the traffic effectively. </p>
      <p>"This bill is modeled upon both the Harrison Narcotic Act and
        the National Firearms Act, which are designed to accomplish
        these same general objectives with respect to opium and coca
        leaves, and firearms, respectively. </p>
      <p>"Under the provisions of this bill all legitimate handlers of
        marihuana are required to pay an occupational tax as follows:
        Manufacturers, compounders, and importers, $24 per year;
        producers, $5 per year; dealers, $3 per year; practitioners
        (doctors, dentists, veterinarians, and others of like
        character), and persons who use marihuana for experimental
        purposes, $1 per year. These persons, in addition to paying the
        occupational tax, must register with the collector of internal
        revenue and file information returns as to their dealings with
        marihuana. </p>
      <p>"However, as an additional means of bringing the traffic in
        marihuana into the open, the bill requires all transfers of
        marihuana to be made in pursuance of official order forms issued
        by the Secretary of the treasury, upon which the details of the
        transaction are set forth. In order to raise the additional
        revenue and to prevent transfers to persons who would use
        marihuana for undesirable purposes, a transfer tax is imposed
        upon each transfer of marihuana. Upon transfers to registered
        persons, this tax is $1 per ounce, while upon transfers to
        non-registered persons, who under ordinary circumstances will be
        the illicit users of marihuana, a heavy tax of $100 per ounce is
        imposed. Heavy criminal penalties are provided for
        manufacturing, producing, or dealing in marihuana without
        registering and paying the special taxes, for transferring
        marihuana without registering and paying the special taxes, for
        transferring marihuana not in pursuance of an order form, and
        for acquiring marihuana without payment of the transfer tax. </p>
      <p>"Thus, the bill is designed, through the occupational tax and
        the order form procedure, to publicize legitimate dealings in
        marihuana and through the $100 transfer tax to prevent the drug
        from coming into the hands of those who will put it to illicit
        uses. </p>
      <p>"The production and sale of hemp and its products for
        industrial purposes will not be adversely affected by this bill.
        In general, the term 'marihuana' is defined in the bill so as to
        include only the flowering tops, leaves and seeds of the hemp
        plant and to exclude the mature stalk, oil and meal obtained
        from the seeds of the plant, and sterilized seed, incapable o
        germination. </p>
      <p>"Under this definition of 'marihuana' the hemp producer will
        pay a small occupational tax but his fiber products will be
        entirely exempt from the provisions of this bill, including the
        order form and transfer tax provisions... The same is true of
        seed produced by the hemp grower for sale for the further
        production of the plant, for the manufacture of oil or for
        birdseed, except that such transfers will be made subject to
        regulations designed to prevent diversion of the seed for
        illegal purposes. </p>
      <p>"Similarly, the manufacturers of oil and the byproducts of
        seed, such as hemp seed cake and meal, will pay an occupational
        tax, but their purchases of seed will be exempt from the
        transfer tax and order form provisions of the bill, if carried
        out in accordance with regulations. Further, under the
        definition of marihuana, the bill will not apply to their sales
        of birdseed, if the hemp seed contained therein is sterilized so
        as to be incapable of germination... </p>
      <p>"The imposition of an occupational tax enables the government
        constitutionally to make it illegal to engage in the occupation
        without payment of the tax. Thus, unless the Congress in this
        bill imposes an occupational tax upon the producers of hemp,
        Congress cannot make the production of hemp for illegal purposes
        illegal. Hence, if the occupational tax is not imposed upon
        producers, marihuana may be legally produced for illicit
        purposes. Furthermore, the imposition of an occupational tax
        enables the Government to require the taxpayer to furnish
        information in connection with the business taxed. This would
        permit the Government to ascertain where the legitimate
        production of hemp is being carried out, and having this
        information, it can stamp out the illicit production more
        effectively. Obviously, therefore, the legitimate producers of
        hemp cannot be further exempted from the provisions of the bill.
        Otherwise, the bill cannot be enforced. </p>
      <p>"Aside from the reasons stated as to why it is believed to be
        impossible to further exempt the producers of hemp from the
        provisions of the bill, Attention is invited to the fact that
        the primary purpose of this legislation is to raise revenue. </p>
      <p>"That completes my statement, and we have witnesses present." </p>
      <p>Sen. Davis: "Do I understand you to say that the primary
        purpose of this bill is to raise revenue?" </p>
      <p>Mr Hester: "The primary reason of this legislation must be to
        raise revenue, because we are resorting to the taxing clause of
        the Constitution and the rule is that if on the face of the bill
        it appears to be a revenue bill, the courts will not inquire
        into any other motives that Congress may have had in enacting
        this legislation..." </p>
      <p>Harry Anslinger was called as the first witness. He read into
        the record several more horror stories, some of the goriest yet,
        and lied about cannabis' medical utility and about the law's
        impact on the legitimate hemp industry. Anslinger also denied
        the "stepping-stone" thesis that marihuana leads to opiate
        addiction: </p>
      <p>Sen. Brown: "Do you think that the recent great increase in the
        use of it that has taken place in the United States is probably
        due to the heavy hand of the law, in its effect upon the use of
        other drugs, and that persons who desire a stimulant are turning
        to this because of enforcement of the Harrison narcotics Act and
        the State laws?" </p>
      <p>Anslinger: "We do not know of any cases where the opium user
        has transferred to marihuana. There is an entirely new class of
        people using marihuana. The opium user is around 35 to 40 years
        old. These users are 20 years old, and know nothing o heroin or
        morphine." </p>
      <p>Sen. Brown: "What has caused the new dissemination o it? We did
        not hear anything of it until last year or so." </p>
      <p>Anslinger: "I do not think that the war against opium has very
        much bearing upon the situation. The same question has been
        discussed in other countries; in Egypt particularly, where a
        great deal of hasheesh is used, and they tried o show that the
        marihuana user went to heroin, and when heroin got short he
        jumped back to hasheesh, but that is not true. This is an
        entirely different class. </p>
      <p>"I do not know just why the abuse of marihuana has spread like
        wildfire in the last 4 or 5 years." </p>
      <p>Mr Matt Rens, founder of the Rens Hemp Company of Madison,
        Wisconsin, entered into the record a written statement that
        interpreted the bill in relation to legitimate hemp producers,
        and suggested some changes, particularly asking that the $5 fee
        be reduced to $1 for the sake of the many small farmers who
        produced only a few acres of hemp for seed. Mr Hester promised
        to oblige him, saying, "We will take care of that." </p>
      <p>Mr M. Mosknes, who was superintendent of the AmHempCo
        Corporation of Danville, Illinois, appeared as a witness for the
        industry to complain about the $5 tax: </p>
      <p>"This company was organized 3 years ago by Bell Brothers of
        Muncie Industries and the Sloan Interests, who are textile
        people in New York. They had in mind developing a process
        whereby a fiber that is being used for rope and cordage could be
        further processed and made into plastics. Three years ago we
        planted 4,200 acres, last year 1,200 acres, and this year 7,000
        acres, and we are in operation. The capacity of the plant is
        15,000 acres. </p>
      <p>"We have to contract our seed from growers in Kentucky, that
        was covered by Mr Rens, and their acreage runs anywhere from a
        quarter of an acre up, and we have no objection to the bill. In
        fact, any attempt to prevent the passage of a bill to protect
        the narcotic traffic would be unethical and un-American. That is
        not the point, but we do believe that a tax of $5 is going to be
        prohibitive for the small dealer as well as the man that grows
        the crop, because he will average ¾ I do not know what the
        average will be, but they raise as little as 2 acres." </p>
      <p>Sen Brown: "As I understand it, Mr Hester can take care of the
        dealer." </p>
      <p>Mr Johnson, who represented Chempaco and the Hemp Chemical
        Corporation, raised similar objections, but as he made clear in
        his somewhat incoherent statement, he did not care about small
        farmers: </p>
      <p>"Now, getting down to the practical part of this measure, no
        one has any business growing this hemp in any quantity whatever
        except under contract with someone who is using it for a
        legitimate business. They have no more business growing it on
        one-tenth of an acre that I have growing sweet potatoes on my
        front lawn. Anyone who uses the seed or who used the stalk --
        the hurd -- or uses the fiber as a manufacturer, a processor,
        who will contract to pay a man a good price to grow it for him;
        and these other people ought to be simply barred, and I am I
        favor of licensing them. I think the small producer is going to
        be eliminated, this man that sticks one-tenth of an acre. And
        why shouldn't he? He is doing no good to himself or anybody
        else. But here is a great industry where men will put in 10, 20,
        30, 40, one gentleman I know planted 2,000 acres and expects to
        plant 20,000 acres. </p>
      <p>"This has been experimented with in South Carolina, in Oregon,
        and all over the country, because these big industries that use
        the fiber and use the hurd have come to take into consideration
        crop failures, and therefore cannot confine themselves to just
        Minnesota or to South Carolina or to Oregon. Some of these
        people have already expended $300,000 in the last few years,
        trying to work out in big industries the use of this fiber, and
        they feel that it should be so stated in the law that the farmer
        who is growing the stalk and growing the fiber knows definitely
        that he is not growing anything that has marihuana in it. He
        does not want to grow marihuana, and yet we might have here an
        industry, purely by phraseology of the measure.., </p>
      <p>"Now, on this question of the tax, and the constitutionality of
        the law, I am firmly convinced that the farmers' can be reduced
        to $1 and this law be sustained. This is not the sort of measure
        that people are saying it is, a regulatory measure under the
        guise of a tax measure. We do not need to run around the corner
        to the hemp industry in order to stop the sale of the flowers or
        of the leaves. It can be taxed like the automobile industry, or
        the cosmetic industry, like the fur industry, and we do not need
        to use any legal sophistry in this to sustain this statute
        because hemp is produced in the United States; and I would say
        in the presence of this committee that I am sure and would
        almost guarantee that Mr Hester and Mr Tipton could go before
        the Supreme Court and get a unanimous decision, if they would
        argue along the lines I am suggesting. This is not like
        narcotics, where there are no poppies growing, nothing like it.
        In my judgment a $1 tax on the farmer is sufficient. To my mind
        this industry is going to be more affected by the regulations,
        but I have no doubt Mr Anslinger and the gentlemen associated
        with him, with their wide experience, will work out regulations
        far more important than the law which will be fair to industry
        and the farmer." </p>
      <p>Sen Brown: "Just let me ask you one question here. You say that
        you want the farmer to be made to realize that he is not growing
        marihuana?" </p>
      <p>Mr Johnson: "In the stalk and fiber." </p>
      <p>Sen Brown: "In the stalk and fiber, but of course he cannot
        grow the stalk and fiber without growing the resin plant?" </p>
      <p>Mr Johnson: "That is right." </p>
      <p>Sen Brown: "How are you going to leave that out? I do not see."
      </p>
      <p>Mr Johnson: "Because he is going to have to sell his product.
        He will have to sell this to a manufacturer. Now, as a matter of
        fact the people making paper, and the finest grades of paper,
        which you cannot make in this country without the use of hemp at
        the present time, and which is being imported ¾ even a great
        deal of the paper that goes into our money is being imported ¾
        must have hemp fiber. It is just a ridiculous situation, because
        it can be made out of our local products in this country. The
        paper manufacturer, when he gets the plant, simply blows these
        leaves away. They disappear when dried. They are gone. As a
        matter of fact, these people in Minnesota did not know until two
        months ago that the hemp which they grew there contained
        marihuana. Until this agitation came up they did not dream of
        it, and they were as much surprised as anyone else. </p>
      <p>"Now, they will have some difficulties, just as the liquor
        people had some difficulties, and the man who does not recognize
        that, the producer or manufacturer, is going to be put out of
        business in my judgment, because there is a problem with
        marihuana." </p>
      <p>The legislators soothed the industry representatives with
        patronizing agreements to agree, and finally entered into the
        record a letter from Dr Woodward, who had spared himself the
        humiliation of appearing before the gaggle of hypocrites: </p>
      <p>"Sir: I have been instructed by the board of trustees of the
        American Medical Association to protest on behalf of the
        association against the enactment in its present form of so much
        of H.R. 6906 as relates to the medicinal use of cannabis and its
        preparation and derivatives... </p>
      <p>"Cannabis and its preparations and derivatives are covered in
        the bill by the term 'marihuana' as that term is defined in
        section 1, para. (b). There is no evidence, however, that the
        medicinal use of these drugs has caused or is causing cannabis
        addiction. As remedial agents they are used to an inconsiderable
        extent, and the obvious purpose and effect of this bill is to
        impose so many restrictions on their medicinal use as to prevent
        such use altogether. Since the medicinal use of cannabis has not
        caused and is not causing addiction, the prevention of he sue of
        the drug for medicinal purposes can accomplish no good end
        whatsoever. How far it may serve to deprive the public of the
        benefits of the drug that on further research may prove to be of
        substantial value, it is impossible to foresee. </p>
      <p>"The American medical Association has no objection to any
        reasonable regulation of the medicinal use of cannabis and its
        preparations and derivatives. It does protest, however, against
        being called upon to pay a special tax, to use special order
        forms in order to procure the drug, to keep special records
        concerning its professional use and to make special returns to
        Treasury Department officials, as a condition precedent to the
        use o cannabis in the practice of medicine in the several
        States, all separate and apart from the taxes, order forms,
        records, and reports required under the Harrison narcotics Act,
        with reference to opium and coca leaves and their preparations
        and derivatives. </p>
      <p>"If the medicinal use of cannabis calls for Federal legal
        regulation further than the legal regulation that now exists,
        the drug can without difficulty be covered under the provisions
        of the Harrison Narcotics Act by a suitable amendment. By such a
        procedure the professional use of cannabis may readily be
        controlled as effectively as are the professional uses of opium
        and coca leaves, with less interference with professional
        practice and less cost and labor on the part of the Treasury
        Department. It has been suggested that the incorporation into
        the Harrison Narcotic Act would jeopardize the constitutionality
        of that act, but that suggestion has been supported by no
        specific statements of its legal basis or citations of legal
        authorities." </p>
      <p>The bill was returned to the House with some suggestions that
        were adopted and returned after being passed without a roll
        call. In reply to a senator's question of whether or not the
        American Mediacl Association agreed with the bill, Congressman
        Vinson lied outright: </p>
      <p>"Our committee heard testimony of Dr William Wharton [sic] who
        not only gave this measure his full support, but also the
        approval from the AMA which he represented as legislative
        counsel." </p>
      <p>The Senate passed the bill offhand, and President Franklin
        Roosevelt delivered the coup de grace with the stroke of a pen
        he signed the Marihuana Tax Act on August 2, 1937. </p>
