      </p>
      <p>In his study of Prehistoric Textile Art of Eastern United
        States (1891), Smithsonian Institute ethnologist W. H. Holmes
        showed that the ancient Mound-Builders utilized cannabis hemp.
        Hundreds of clay pipes, some containing cannabis residues and
        wrapped in hemp cloth, were found in the so-called Death Mask
        Mound of the Hopewell Mound Builders who lived circa 400 BC in
        modern Ohio. At one site in Morgan County, Tennessee, Holmes
        recovered large pieces of hemp fabric: </p>
      <p>"As if to convey to the curious investigator of modern times a
        complete knowledge of their weavers' art, the friends of the
        dead deposited with the body not only the fabrics worn during
        life but a number of skeins of the fiber from which the fabrics
        were probably made. This fiber has been identified as that of
        cannabis sativa, or wild hemp..." (1) </p>
      <p>The Vikings depended on hemp for their rope and sails, and they
        probably carried the seed with them and planted it when they
        visited North America about a thousand years ago. Sailors
        usually carried supplies of seeds with them to provide the
        necessities of life in case of shipwreck. Perhaps Christopher
        Columbus also did the good deed when he arrived in 1492, with
        the aid of over 80 tons of hemp rigging. Certainly, however,
        cannabis arrived in prehistoric times, possibly brought from
        China by explorers, and birds crossing the Bering Strait to the
        left coast of America. (2, 3) </p>
      <p>The Florentine John De Verrazzano made the first reported
        sighting of wild hemp in North America during a French
        expedition to Virginia in 1524: </p>
      <p>"We found those folkes to be more white than those that we
        found before, being clad with certain leaves that hang on boughs
        of trees, which they sewe together with threds of wilde hemp..."
        (4) </p>
      <p>The French explorer Jacques Cartier also reported seeing wild
        hemp during each of his three journeys to Canada in 1535, 1536,
        and 1541. In his last report, he wrote: </p>
      <p>"The land groweth fulle of Hempe which groweth of it selfe,
        which is as good as possibly may be seen, and as strong." </p>
      <p>When Thomas Hariot described his visit to Virginia in 1585, he
        observed: </p>
      <p>"The trueth is, that of Hempe and Flaxe there is no great store
        in any one place together, by reason it is not planted but as
        the soile doth yielde of itself." </p>
      <p>Some authorities have identified "wild hemp" as wood nettle
        (Laportea canadensis) or Indian hemp (Apocynum cannabinum). True
        hemp (Cannabis sativa) did not become a formally recognized
        member of North American flora until 1606, when it was imported
        from Europe and introduced at Port Royal, Nova Scotia by Louis
        Hebert, who was Samuel Champlain's apothecary and botanist. </p>
      <p>Champlain mentioned in 1605 that the natives used "wild hemp"
        to tie their bone fishhooks. Indians used hemp baskets in the
        harvesting of corn, according to the description by Henry
        Spelman in 1609, when he visited Virginia with Thomas Hariot: </p>
      <p>"Sum [baskets] are made of the barkes of trees, sum of hempe
        which naturally groweth..." (6) </p>
      <p>John Adair mentioned the use of hemp by the Cherokees and other
        tribes in his <i>History of the American Indians</i> (1775). </p>
      <p>The first European colonists also used wild hemp when they
        arrived in America, but there was not enough of it. Food crops
        were the first priority, but the colonists were not eager to
        grow hemp even though the seed is an excellent meal. The Quebec
        colony minister Jean Talon simply confiscated all the thread the
        colonists possessed and forced them to buy it back from him with
        hemp. He loaned the necessary seed to the farmers, who were
        required to reimburse Talon with fresh seed from their harvest.
        (5) </p>
      <p>In William Wood's <i>Description of New England</i> (1634), he
        noted: </p>
      <p>"This land likewise affords hempe and flax, some naturally, and
        some planted by the English with rapes if they be well managed."
        (4,7) </p>
      <p>Another report of a visit to Canada, recorded in <i>Colonial
          Papers of Virginia</i> (1662), gives this accordance: </p>
      <p>"Account of the commodities of the Plantation of Quebec: 1. The
        soil very good to produce hemp. 2. Great store of hemp growing
        naturally in the Huron's country..." (8) </p>
      <p>A Dutch farmer named Le Page Du Pratz, who came to America to
        oversee French plantations near the present site of New Orleans,
        and who was familiar with true hemp, wrote in his journal
        (1719): </p>
      <p>"I ought not to omit to take notice, that hemp grows naturally
        on the lands adjoining to the lakes on the west of the
        Mississippi. The stalks are as thick as one's finger, and about
        six feet long. They are quite like ours in the wood, the leaf
        and the rind." (9) </p>
      <p>Hemp was so important to the colonists that it was deemed
        mandatory to cultivate the crop. The Puritans grew hemp at
        Jamestown in keeping with their contract with the Virginia
        Company in 1607. The first governor, Lord Delaware, reported
        about hemp upon his arrival in 1609: </p>
      <p>"The countrey is wonderful fertile and very rich, Hempe better
        than English growing wilde in abundance." (10) </p>
      <p>The second governor, Sir Thomas Dale, brought with him
        instructions to plant a communal garden in which to experiment
        with hemp and flax. By 1616 the Puritans were able to claim of
        their hemp that there was "none better in England or Holland".
        Yet however vital they were to the economy, hemp and flax were
        not able to compete with tobacco. Hemp sold for 10-22
        shillings/100 pounds, while tobacco fetched over 3
        shillings/pound in Virginia. The Virginia Company therefore
        issued a directive to the Jamestown colonists in 1619, to "set
        100 plants and the governor to set 5000" hemp plants. In the
        same year, the Virginia General Assembly also required the
        colonists to grow "both English and Indian hemp" -- Cannabis
        sativa and indica. Gabriel Wisher was assigned a budget of 100
        pounds to hire several skilled Swedish and Polish hemp dressers
        and entice them (with 10 pounds each) to emigrate to America.
        (11, 12) </p>
      <p>The town of Salem received its first shipment of hempseed in
        1629, and Samuel Cornhill was given the charge of cultivating an
        acre of proper ground with it. The Pilgrims of the Massachusetts
        Colony were urged to grow hemp to provide clothing for winter.
        The General Court directed in June 1641 that "wild hemp" be
        gathered, grown and employed as they had learned to do from the
        native Americans. The Court further "desired and expected
        that... all hands may be implied for the working of hemp and
        flaxe and other needful things..." </p>
      <p>Some of the Massachusetts colonists, led by Thomas Morton,
        established the Merry Mount trading settlement, where they
        smoked hemp in the peace pipe with natives. They held bonfire
        parties that eventually enraged the Puritans, who burned down
        the outpost and sent Morton to an English prison, where he wrote
        of his experiences in <i>New England Canaan</i>. </p>
      <p>In 1637 the General Court at Hartford ordered all families to
        plant one teaspoonful of hempseed. Massachusetts did likewise in
        1639. The General Assembly of Connecticut repeated its order in
        1640, insisting that the colonists sow hemp, "that we might in
        time have supply of linen cloth among ourselves". </p>
      <p>In writing about <i>New England's First Fruits</i> (1642), Mr.
        Hutchinson gave thanks to Divine Providence for "prospering
        hempe and flax so well that it is frequently sowen, spun, and
        woven into linen cloth, (and in short time may serve for
        cordage).." </p>
      <p>In his first report for 1644, Governor Winthrop stated: </p>
      <p>"Our supplies from England failing much, men began to look
        about them, and fell to a manufacture... of hemp and flax,
        wherein Rowley, to their great commendation, exceeded all other
        towns." </p>
      <p>The first American ropewalk for manufacturing hemp rope was
        built in Salem in 1635. Boston merchants organized to invite
        ropemaker John Harrison to migrate from England in 1642, and
        gave him a lifelong monopoly. By 1770 there were 14 ropewalks in
        Boston, and at least one in almost every coastal town. Benedict
        Arnold destroyed the strategic Public Rope Walk in Warwick,
        Virginia when he led British troops up the Jones River in April
        1781. </p>
      <p>The spectacle of a large rope factory inspired Henry W.
        Longfellow to write <i>The Ropewalk</i> (1854): </p>
      <p>"In that building, long and low, <br>
        With its windows all a-row <br>
        Like the port-holes of a hulk, <br>
        Human spiders spin and spin, <br>
        Backwards down their thread so thin <br>
        Dropping, each a hempen thread..." </p>
      <p>Several colonies passed legal-tender laws by which certain
        manufactures could be used to pay debts and taxes. For example,
        in 1682 the Virginia "Act for the Advancement of Manufactures"
        made hemp, flax, wool, tar and lumber legal tender. Pennsylvania
        followed suit; in order "to encourage flax and hemp", declared
        hemp to be worth 4 pence/pound. The Crown abrogated the law in
        1693, but it was renewed in 1700, and the exchange rate was not
        fixed but bartered. Maryland enacted similar legislation in
        1706, making hemp worth 6 p/lb for a quarter of any financial or
        tobacco debt. Rhode Island paid a bounty of 8 p/lb in 1721 and
        accepted tax payments at the same rate. Massachusetts and New
        Hampshire also accepted hemp for taxes. </p>
      <p>In <i>A Perfect Description of Virginia</i> (1649), Peter
        Force praised Capt. Matthews, an exemplary Virginia planter "and
        a most deserving Common-wealths-man" whose virtues included hemp
        husbandry: </p>
      <p>"He hath a fine house, and all thinges answerable to it; he
        sowes yearly store of Hempe and Flax, and causes it to be
        spun... and in a word, keeps a good house, lives bravely, and a
        true lover of Virginia; he is worthy of much honour..." </p>
      <p>Hemp was so valuable to the British economy that in 1662,
        Parliament authorized Virginia Governor William Berkely to offer
        a bounty of two pounds of tobacco per pound of finished hemp. In
        order to stimulate its production, the Maryland law of 1671
        granted a bounty of a pound of tobacco for each pound of hemp.
        The law was passed again in 1682, 1688, and 1698. </p>
      <p>Hemp imports were equally vital to early American industry and
        home life. The <i>Calendar of State Papers for Colonial
          Virginia</i> published a notice to this effect in 1665,
        stating that, "Hemp is so useful that a tariff may well be
        dispensed with..." (14) </p>
      <p>In the crisis of 1681, the British Committee for Trade and
        Plantations advised the Crown to send hemp and flax seed to the
        Virginia colony. In yet another attempt to encourage hemp
        farming, Virginia made hemp acceptable in payment for a quarter
        of farmers' debts in 1682. Maryland followed suit in 1683, and
        Pennsylvania in 1706. (15) </p>
      <p>By 1690 there was enough hemp, flax and cotton available to
        supply the paper industry, and the first paper mill in America
        was established in Pennsylvania by the firm of Rittenhouse. </p>
      <p>In June 1693 the governor of the Hudson Bay Company issued
        instructions to the governor of York Fort, including a memo: </p>
      <p>"We have sent you some flax and hemp seeds which we will also
        have sowed upon ground most suitable, and for directions we
        refer you to the printed book now sent you." (16) </p>
      <p>The General Court of Massachusetts in 1701 passed a law to
        subsidize the purchase of hemp by a petitioning company for a
        farthing per pound on condition that the company bought all of
        the "bright, well-cured, water-retted hemp, 4 feet long" that
        was raised in the colony for 12 p/lb. </p>
      <p>England could not get enough hemp to meet he demands.
        Therefore, an act was passed in 1704 granting a bounty of 6
        pounds sterling/ton water-retted hemp, and it continued in
        effect for 50 years. Maryland offered another pound-for-pound
        bounty of tobacco for hemp in 1727 in order to provide England
        with the commodity. </p>
      <p>The 1720-22&nbsp; sessions of the Connecticut General Assembly
        approved a bounty of 4 shillings/100 lb of retted hemp .
        Virginia continued to pass laws to compel farmers to produce the
        crop, and in 1762 began to fine farmers who did not comply. </p>
      <p>Rhode Island granted a petition in 1722 to William Borden of
        Newport to pay him a bounty of 20 shillings per bolt of hemp
        cloth, equal in quality to good Dutch duck. The subsidy lasted
        ten years. His services were so valuable that when he later
        petitioned the public treasury, "if there be so much to spare",
        to grant him 500 pounds for three years, he received it. He
        applied again in 1728, and the appreciative General Court loaned
        him 3000 pounds without interest. He was obliged to manufacture
        150 bolts annually but was unable to do so. The legislature was
        determined to sustain the effort and so confirmed another grant
        to relieve Borden from the obligatory quota while it continued
        to pay the bounty for what he did make. </p>
      <p>In 1726, John Powell of Boston presented a memorial to the
        General Court, claiming that he had found the local hemp to be
        well adapted to the manufacture of sailcloth. He proposed to set
        20 looms to work within 18 months. Borden was paid a subsidy of
        30 shillings per bolt of duck he produced. </p>
      <p>In a good effort to educate the public about the benefits of
        hemp and the need for its cultivation, South Carolina
        legislators voted in 1733 to pay a salary to Richard Hall to
        write a book on the subject and to promote the industry for
        three years. Hall traveled to Holland to procure good hempseed.
        In 1735, Boston bookseller Daniel Henchman printed Lionel
        Slator's<i> Instructions for the Cultivating and Raising of Flax
          and Hemp</i>. In 1737, the Massachusetts public treasury began
        receiving hemp in payment for taxes at 4 sh/lb. </p>
      <p>In his <i>Essays Upon Field Husbandry in New England</i>
        (1739), Jared Eliot stressed the importance of hemp: </p>
      <p>"What I have principally in view is hemp. New England doth not,
        I suppose, Expend less than several hundred Thousand Pounds
        worth of Foreign Hemp yearly. If we can raise more than to
        supply our own Occasions, we may send it Home... </p>
      <p>"It is not a meer Conjecture that the dreined Lands will
        produce Hemp. I am informed by my worthy Friend Benjamin
        Franklin Esq of Pennsylvania that they raise Hemp upon their
        dreined Lands..." (17) </p>
      <p>Benjamin Franklin had written to Eliot on 16 July 1747: </p>
      <p>"In your last, you enquir'd about the kind of Land from which
        our Hemp is rais'd. I am told that it must be very rich land;
        sometimes they use drain'd swamps and bank'd Meadows; But the
        greatest part of our Hemp is brought from Canistogo which is a
        large and very rich tract 70 miles from this city on the banks
        of the Susquehannah a large fresh water River. It is brought
        down in Waggons..." </p>
      <p>In his <i>Report on Laws</i> to the Pennsylvania Assembly
        Committee (15 February 1754), Franklin pointed out a growing
        problem with the hemp industry: </p>
      <p>"That great Frauds are complained of in the Making up of Hemp
        for Sale in this Province... and as nothing is more to the
        Reputation of a People, and the Advantage of Commerce, than
        Faithfulness in making up their Wares and Merchandize, we think
        a Law to remedy the above Evils will be very useful." </p>
      <p>In a letter to Alexander Small (5 July 1763), he mentioned a
        "Hemp Machine" invented by a Mr. Mures: </p>
      <p>"His Proposal is that when the Hemp is thoroughly dry, (perhaps
        laid for some time in an Oven or in a Kiln) it shall be pressed
        between two Cylinders, a little fluted, so as not only to crush
        the bun or reed, but also break it in Pieces, so that it may be
        the more easily separated from the Hemp..." (18) </p>
      <p>In his marginalia to a British pamphlet entitled <i>Another
          Letter</i> (1770), Franklin wrote: </p>
      <p>"Did ever any North American bring his Hemp to England for this
        Bounty. We have not yet enough for our own Consumption. We began
        to make our own Cordage. You want to suppress that Manufacture,
        and would do it by getting the raw Material from us; You want to
        be supply'd with hemp for your Manufactures, and Russia demands
        Money. These were the motives for giving what you are pleased to
        call a Bounty to us. We thank you for your Bounties. We love you
        and therefore must be oblig'd to you for being good to
        yourselves..." </p>
      <p>The production of the prosaic commodity was so limited that in
        1751, for example, New Jersey exported only 7 tons of hemp. A
        group of professional spinners and weavers from Ireland arrived
        in Boston in 1718, and soon they taught many women how to
        improve their skills. Another group of Irish immigrants arrived
        in Massachusetts in 1745, and introduced improved modes of
        spinning-work. Thereafter, thousands of New England women held
        gatherings called "spinning bees" to produce hemp and flax
        cloth. Thus they were able to boycott English fabric goods and
        became more self-sufficient. The early American paper industry
        also benefited greatly from this increased production. </p>
      <p>In his <i>Abstract of the Most Useful Parts of a Late Treatise
          on Hemp</i> (1766) by M. Marcandier, editor Timothy Painne
        urged his fellow Americans to make trials of hemp: </p>
      <p>"Great part of the soils of the North American Colonies, are so
        well known, to be peculiarly suitable for the growth of hemp,
        and the mutual interest of Great Britain and those Colonies, to
        be evidently much dependent upon the increase of this
        universally useful vegetable, that we persuade ourselves, that
        every sincere attempt for the encouragement thereof, must be met
        with the approbation of the public... </p>
      <p>"Hemp may be said... to be the most necessary produce of all
        others, save that of bread corn, in the new settlements of
        America, where sheep cannot safely be kept, as it may be applied
        so as to provide for one half of the clothing of the
        inhabitants... </p>
      <p>"The principal advantage that Hemp, intended for these uses,
        will have over wool, grogram yarn, and cotton, is, that it may
        be used without spinning, or even combing. It will be in no
        danger from those worms, which commonly eat woolen cloth; and
        the beauty, as well as the lasting nature and low price of it,
        will render it preferable to any other material... </p>
      <p>"After the particular account we have given of the nature and
        properties of Hemp, we doubt not but that the people of the
        country will avail themselves of all the advantages that they
        may attain by the practice of these new methods. </p>
      <p>"It is presumed none will be at a loss to determine, that the
        two most important materials which the Inhabitants of these
        Colonies should be principally encouraged in the growth of, are
        Flax and Hemp, being the most extensively useful of any which
        can be so easily and generally produced in North America.. </p>
      <p>"These weighty considerations with many others which are very
        obvious, will necessarily excite all those who have a regard to
        the interest of the Mother-Country, as well as the peculiar
        benefit of these Colonies, to promote the growth of the said
        Commodities, to the utmost of their ability and influence." </p>
      <p>The introduction to <i>Observations on the Raising and
          Dressing of Hemp</i> (1777), addressed "the inhabitants of
        North America" with more good advice and information that holds
        true today in the wake of NAFTA and GATT agreements: </p>
      <p>"As it has been thought requisite, by a continental
        association, to put a stop to the importation of manufactures
        into America, it is absolutely necessary to fall speedily on
        some effectual method to furnish, at least, the coarsest
        articles of our clothing. </p>
      <p>"Our country produces wool, cotton, hemp and flax, materials
        amply sufficient to answer every demand of necessity and
        convenience. The quantity may be increased by attention and
        diligence, and wrought up with a degree of skill easily
        attainable... </p>
      <p>"By beginning with coarse manufactures we shall begin at the
        right end, we shall, every succeeding year, improve upon the
        past, and, after a fair exertion of the means in our power, we
        shall look back, with wonder and astonishment, at our present
        apprehension. </p>
      <p>"We must now exert ourselves in manufactures, or, from an
        unconquerable indolence, be driven to the basest and most
        humiliating concessions that others may dispose of our lives,
        liberties and properties, at their pleasure. </p>
      <p>"When everything valuable to men is thus at stake, the author
        claims the privilege of a citizen, and entreats the attention to
        the public, to a subject of so great consequences to this
        country as that which is now submitted to their consideration.
        It is no less than a certain and easy method of supplying,
        internally, the most necessary and considerable parts of our
        clothing." </p>
      <p>The prominent Virginia landowner and politician Robert "King"
        Carter anticipated the Revolution and decided in 1774 that
        tobacco was not a worthwhile crop. He told his foreman, "I
        apprehend that tobacco which may be here, next summer will be in
        little demand... in place of tobacco -- hemp and flax will be
        grown". Mandatory cultivation laws were passed "as a preparation
        for war". Every farmer had to deliver one pound of dressed hemp
        annually, "under oath that it was of his own growth." (21) </p>
      <p>When Thomas Paine exhorted his fellows to fight for freedom
        with <i>Common Sense</i>, he mentioned hemp: </p>
      <p>"In almost every article of defence we abound. Hemp flourishes
        even to rankness, so that we need not want cordage..." </p>
      <p>The first and second drafts (28 June and 2 July 1776) of the
        Declaration of Independence were written on Dutch hemp paper.
        The second draft was submitted and agreed upon, then copied onto
        animal parchment and signed on 2 August 1776. </p>
      <p><b>(2) George Washington</b><a name="washington"></a> </p>
      <p>George Washington was a hemp farmer, and he mentioned the plant
        several times in his writings. Washington made these entries in
        his farm diary in 1765: </p>

      <p>In <i>Calendar</i>1: 457, he noted that the quality of the
        fiber from virgin female hemp "may arise from their being
        coarser, and the stalks longer." </p>
      <p>George Washington may well have cultivated some cannabis for
        medicinal and occasional recreational purposes. Both he and
        Thomas Jefferson (who quite disliked tobacco) are known to have
        exchanged gifts of smoking mixtures. In the 1790's, Washington
        also began to cultivate "India Hemp", the resinous variety
        developed in India. Cannabis at that time had several names,
        such as "common hemp" (C. sativa, cultivated for fiber and
        seeds), and "India hemp" (C. indica, grown for fiber and resin).
        The latter is not to be confused with "Indian hemp"(Apocynum
        cannabinum, dogbane), used by native Americans. The modern term
        "Indian hemp" is applied to jute, which is not related to
        Cannabis sativa. Jute was not introduced to America until much
        later. </p>
      <p>Washington's concern about India Hemp is illustrated in these
        excerpts from letters his overseer Pearce: </p>
      <p>"I also gave the Gardener a few Seed of East India hemp to
        raise from, enquire for the seed which has been saved, and make
        the most of it at the proper season for sowing..." [6 Jan.
        1794]. </p>
      <p>"Let the most that can, be made of the pint of Oats which the
        Gardener raisd last year, and of the Hemp seed..." [19 Jan.
        1794]. </p>
      <p>"You have never informed me how much St. foin and India Hemp
        seed he has saved..." [9 Feb. 1794]. </p>
      <p>"I am very glad to hear that the Gardener has saved so much of
        the St. foin seed, and that of the India Hemp. Make the most of
        both, by sowing them again in drill... The Hemp may be sown
        anywhere..." [24 Feb. 1794]. </p>
      <p>"The St.foin and India hemp may be sown in the lot which you
        have mentioned, as more secure perhaps than the other, against
        Hares; but how they will be annoyed by fowls you can judge
        better of than I. I wish to have the most that can be made of
        them..." [9 Mar. 1794]. </p>
      <p>"Make the most... of the Hemp..." [30 Mar. 1794]. </p>
      <p>"Presuming you saved all you could from the India hemp, let it
        be carefully sown again, for the purpose of getting into a full
        stock of seed..." [15 March 1795]. </p>
      <p>"Let particular care be taken of the India Hempseed, and as
        much good grd. allotted for its reception next year as is
        competent to Sow..." [5 Nov. 1796]. </p>
      <p>"Have you succeeded, or are you likely to succeed, in procuring
        the Hemp seed I required?" [3 Dec. 1799 to Thomas Peter]. </p>
      <p>Washington also mentioned hemp in a letter to Dr. James
        Anderson (26 May 1794). He was referring to a hempseed soup
        stock made in Silesia: </p>
      <p>"I thank you as well for the Seeds as for the Pamphlets which
        you had the goodness to send me. The artificial preparation of
        Hemp, from Silesia [an area between Germany and Poland], is
        really a curiosity; and I shall think myself much favored in the
        continuance of your correspondence..." </p>
      <p>When Washington wrote to Robert Cary &amp; Co. in London, he
        requested a quotation for American hemp (20 Sept. 1765): </p>
      <p>"In order thereto you would do me a singular favour in advising
        of the general price one might expect for good Hemp in your Port
        watered and prepared according to Act of Parliament..." </p>
      <p>In a letter to James Gildart (21 July 1766), Washington wrote:
      </p>
      <p>"I am much oblig'd to you for your enquiry in the prices of
        Hemp and Flax..." </p>
      <p>In a query to the Secretary of the Treasury (14 Oct. 1791),
        Washington recommended increasing hemp production for national
        security: </p>
      <p>"How far, in addition to the several matters mentioned in that
        letter, would there be propriety do you conceive in suggesting
        the policy of encouraging the growth of Cotton, and Hemp in such
        parts of the United States as are adapted to the culture of
        these articles? The advantages which could result to this
        Country from the produce of articles, which ought to be
        manufactured at home is apparent... The establishment of
        Arsenals in convenient and proper places is, in my opinion, a
        measure of high national importance meriting the serious
        attention of Congress..." </p>
      <p>Writing to Arthur Young in 1795, Washington offered his
        considered opinion: </p>
      <p>"Much hemp might be raised in these countries were there the
        proper encouragement. the foreign hemp gluts the market and
        there is not sufficient protecting duty to spur the farmer to
        raise this useful article. Our hemp lands would average a 700
        weight to the acre... Rich fresh bottom lands yield 500 or 600
        and highly manured land 6, 8 or 900 pounds to the acre." </p>
      <p><b>(3) Thomas Jefferson</b><a name="jefferson"></a> </p>
      <p>Thomas Jefferson also grew hemp, and he kept a record of his
        enterprises and thoughts on the matter in his account book, <i>Notes




          on Tobacco</i>, and other&nbsp; writings: </p>
      <p>"Hemp. Plough the ground for it early and very deep, which
        should be in March. A hand can tend 3 acres of hemp a year.
        Tolerable ground yields 500 lb. to the acre. You may generally
        count on 100 lb. for every foot the hemp is over 4 ft. high. A
        hand will break 60 or 70 lb. a day, and even to 150 lb. if it is
        divided with an overseer, divide it as prepared. </p>
      <p>"Seed. To make hemp seed, make hills of the form &amp; size of
        cucumber hills, from 4 to 6 ft. apart, in proportion to the
        strength of the ground. Prick about a dozen seeds into each
        hill, in different parts of them. When they come up thin them to
        two. As soon as the male plants have shed their farina, cut them
        up that the whole nourishment may go to the female plants. Every
        plant thus tended will yield a quart of seed. A bushel of good
        brown seed is enough for an acre." (23, 24) </p>
      <p>Jefferson recognize the value of hemp, and in 1781, during his
        term as Governor of Virginia, he kept reserves of "the hemp in
        the back country" for use as payment for military supplies. </p>
      <p>In May 1781, David Ross notified Jefferson that the Virginia
        Delegates had "no encouragement from Congress... in money
        matters. Tobacco will not do there [in Philadelphia] and we have
        nothing to depend upon but our hemp." On June 1781 the Virginia
        General Assembly requested the Governor to help its impoverished
        delegates by sending them hemp or tobacco to sell. </p>
      <p>Jefferson disliked tobacco, as he explained in his <i>Farm
          Journal</i> (16 March 1791): </p>
      <p>"The culture [of tobacco] is pernicious. This plant greatly
        exhausts the soil. Of course, it requires much manure, therefore
        other productions are deprived of manure, yielding no
        nourishment for cattle, there is no return for the manure
        expended... It is impolitic... The fact well established in the
        system of agriculture is that the best hemp and the best tobacco
        grow on the same kind of soil. The former article is of the
        first necessity to the commerce and marine, in other words to
        the wealth and protection of the country. The latter, never
        useful and sometimes pernicious, derives its estimation from
        caprice, and its best value from the taxes to which it was
        formerly exposed..." </p>
      <p>Jefferson was not fond of flax either, as he explained in a
        letter to George Fleming (29 Dec. 2825): </p>
      <p>"Flax is so injurious to our lands and of so scanty produce
        that I have never attempted it. Hemp, on the other hand, is
        abundantly productive and will grow forever on the same spot,
        but the breaking and beating it is so slow, so laborious and so
        much complained of by our laborers, that I have given it up...
        But recently a method of removing the difficulty of preparing
        hemp occurred to me, so simple and so cheap. I modified a
        threshing machine to turn a very strong hemp-break, much
        stronger and heavier than those for the hand. By this the cross
        arm lifts and lets fall the break twice in every revolution of
        the wallower. A man feeds the break with the hemp stalks...
        where it is more perfectly beaten than I have ever seen done by
        hand... I expect that a single horse will do the breaking and
        beating of ten men." </p>
      <p>Jefferson described the machine in greater detail in another
        letter of 1815, and he noted: </p>
      <p>"Something of this kind has been so long wanted by the
        cultivators of hemp, that as soon as I can speak of its effect
        with certainty, I shall probably describe it anonymously in the
        public papers, in order to forestall the prevention of its use
        by some interloping patentee." (25) </p>
      <p>Thomas Jefferson received U.S. Patent #1 for his invention. </p>
      <p><b>(4) Early Congress &amp; Hemp</b><a name="congress"></a> </p>
      <p>The papers of Alexander Hamilton contain many mentions of hemp.
        While he served as the first Secretary of the U.S Treasury,
        Hamilton wrote of it in his <i>Report on Manufactures</i>
        (1791): </p>
      <p>"In respect to hemp, something has already been done by the
        high duty on foreign hemp. If the facilities for domestic
        production were not unusually great, the policy of the duty, on
        the foreign raw material, would be highly questionable, as
        interfering with the growth of manufactures of it... This is an
        article of importance enough to warrant the employment of
        extraordinary means in its favor." </p>
      <p>David Ross addressed the Virginia Delegates in a letter (May
        1781) concerning hemp: </p>
      <p>"I am sorry to be informed by Mr Nicholson that the present
        Invasion of Virginia puts it out of his power to Negotiate the
        Sale of any Tobacco in Philadelphia, that he has no chance of
        procuring supplys unless he is furnished with Specie or hemp --
        the former cannot be procured -- of the latter I hope to send on
        40 tons in the Course of this summer..." </p>
      <p>Tench Coxe, the Assistant Secretary of the treasury, informed
        Hamilton of the invention of a new hemp mill and its economic
        potential in February 1790: </p>
      <p>"The duty on hemp, wh. is not produced in sufficient quantity
        for our present demand and which demand will be very much
        increased by the time the duty will be in operation is menacing
        circumstance to the makers of those indispensable Articles,
        Cordage &amp; Sailcloth. If the new invention of the hemp &amp;
        flax spinning Mill does not prove a deception this duty will be
        a very unfortunate thing..." (27) </p>
      <p>By 1810 Russia had become one of the most important markets for
        American products, particularly tobacco, furs, and tropical
        merchandise from the West Indies. The USA sent 10% of its
        exports to Russia in trade for iron, hemp and flax. Russia
        produced the most and the best hemp, flax and iron in the world
        at that time. Russian hemp was treated with great care and
        patience. The entire process of growing, retting, breaking and
        hackling hemp required up to two years to complete and deliver
        to port. This was possible only because serf labor was so cheap.
        (28) </p>
      <p>As a young man, John Quincy Adams (1767-1848), the 6th
        President of the United States, lived in Moscow. In 1810 he
        wrote a report <i>On the Culture &amp; Preparing of Hemp in
          Russia</i>, which was included in <i>A Compilation of
          Articles Relating to the Culture and Manufacture of Hemp in
          the US</i> (1829). (29) </p>
      <p>Dr. Burke, the President of the American Historical Reference
        Society, researched the correspondence of the first several
        presidents, and in 1975 confirmed that seven of them smoked
        cannabis. George Washington preferred to smoke "the leaves of
        hemp" rather than to drink alcohol. James Madison was once heard
        to say that smoking hemp inspired him to found a new nation on
        democratic principles. James Monroe, the 5th US President, was
        introduced to hashish when he was serving as Ambassador to
        France, and he continued to enjoy the smoke until he was 73
        years old. When Andrew Jackson, Zachary Taylor and Franklin
        Pierce served as military commanders, they each smoked hemp with
        their soldiers. In one letter to his family, Pierce complained
        that hemp was "about the only good thing" about the Mexican War.
        (30) </p>
      <p>American hemp was produced by dew-retting, which produces an
        inferior product unsuitable for marine use. Tests were conducted
        aboard the USS Constitution ("Old Ironsides") in the 1820s
        demonstrating that rigging made with American hemp was at best
        as good as rope made of Russian hemp. The USS Constitution
        carried over 60 tons of hemp rigging, including an anchor cable
        nearly two feet in circumference and 720 feet long. The total
        length of running rigging was over 4 miles of laid hemp. </p>
      <p>Other tests aboard the USS North Carolina showed, however, that
        American hemp cables lost about 80% of their strength after 18
        months of exposure to seawater. Most American hemp was used to
        make cheap rope to bind cotton bales. Dew-retted fiber was
        sufficient for the purpose, but only a desperate and foolhardy
        sailor would leave port without water-retted Russian rigging. </p>
      <p><b>(5) The American Hemp Industry</b><a name="industry"></a> </p>
      <p>The first hemp crop in Kentucky was planted in 1775 the
        Bluegrass land for subsequent grain crops. By 1840, Kentucky
        farmers were producing about 6,000 tons of fiber annually. There
        were 38 ropewalks in the state in 1810. In 1828, Lexington was
        home to ten bagging factories and rope walks. Also in 1828,
        President Buchanan praised Kentucky hemp in an address to
        Congress. By 1839 there were more than 3,500 hemp plantations in
        the state, yielding over 18,000 tons of fiber. About 1/3 was
        water-retted. Prices varied from $90-$180/ton. After the Civil
        War, production dropped to only 2,500 tons by 1869. The Kentucky
        hemp industry depended on slaves, who were no longer available.
        The work of breaking hemp was so dirty and laborious that few
        white men would do it. None but strong Negro men were capable of
        the work and experienced at it, and they too usually declined
        the job after they were emancipated. It was estimated that three
        slaves could cultivate about 50 acres averaging 700 pound of
        fiber/acre. </p>
      <p>The task system required a slave to produce a daily quota of
        about 100 pounds of fiber. They received one cent per pound
        above the quota. This allowed some of them to earn up to $2/day,
        and a few slaves were thus able to buy their freedom. The same
        system was used in the rope-walks. William Hayden, who was
        "acknowledged to be the best spinner in the country", saved
        enough money to buy his freedom in 1824. </p>
      <p>Slaves were often hired out as laborers, mechanics, and miners,
        usually with the slave's consent. Hemp manufacturer John Coleman
        (Woodford Cty, KY) paid the slaves $5/years as a bonus for good
        behavior in addition to the $50 he paid the owner. He made this
        stipulation in his contract with John McQuiddie (29 Dec. 1831):
      </p>
      <p>"I am to treat said men well, feed, and clothe them, and pay
        taxes and physicians' bills, etc, and return them well clothed."
      </p>
      <p>Despite the prevalence of hemp cultivation in America, there
        was no known use of the flowers for intoxication except among
        field hands. In his address to a scientific meeting in 1943, Dr.
        J. Reichard said: </p>
      <p>"Old persons in Kentucky report seeing colored field hands
        break up and load their pipes with dried flowering tops of the
        plants and smoke them." (34) </p>
      <p>An article published in 1859 pointed out the essential role of
        blacks in the hemp industry: </p>
      <p>"Quite a variety of machinery has been tried for hemp breaking,
        together with Dutch, Irish and Native [Indian] workers, but a
        stout Negro man, with a good hand brake, a fair task before him,
        and prompt pay for his overwork, now has a decided preference,
        if not a complete monopoly." </p>
      <p>In 1841, Congress was induced to order the Navy to buy American
        hemp at every opportunity, and in 1843 appropriated $50,000 for
        the purpose. The Navy sent purchasing agents to Kentucky and
        Missouri to buy water-retted hemp, but they required that
        samples be sent to the Charleston Navy Yard (Massachusetts) for
        testing before authorizing a purchase. The delay was not
        worthwhile to growers, and some complained that their product
        had been unfairly rejected by the inspectors. Little Kentucky
        hemp, therefore, was bought by the Navy. The Kentucky General
        Assembly appealed to Congress in 1842 to construct a
        hemp-retting facility as a national security measure. Congress
        did establish a rope factory in Memphis in 1852 and equipped it
        with the best available machinery, but so little southern hemp
        was delivered that the project was abandoned after two years.
        (14) </p>
      <p>During the Civil War, Congress ordered the Commissioner of
        Agriculture to investigate hemp as a substitute for cotton. The
        war had initially generated an increased demand for hemp, but
        the industry was ultimately ruined and never recovered. After
        the war, cotton dominated southern agriculture, and cheap jute
        came to replace hemp&nbsp; for cotton bagging. At the same time,
        wood pulp paper became widely available and reduced the demand
        for hemp as a paper-making material. Moreover, the loss of the
        slave labor force and the lack of mechanical harvesters and
        processors doomed the industry. </p>
      <p>John Greenleaf Whittier (1807-1892), the militant "Quaker
        Poet", wrote The Hashish as a metaphor for cotton and slavery: </p>
      <p>"Of all that Orient lands can vaunt <br>
        Of marvels with our own competing, <br>
        The strangest is the Haschish plant, <br>
        And what will follow on its eating... </p>
      <p>O potent plant! so rare a taste <br>
        Has never Turk nor Gentoo gotten; <br>
        The hempen Haschish of the East <br>
        Is powerless to our Western Cotton!" (35) </p>
      <p>In "The Ballad of John Murrel", written in the wake of the
        Civil War, the singer bemoaned his hempen fate: </p>
      <p>" ...But I had left my soul behind me! <br>
        Why'd I listen to him tempt <br>
        And coax till one sad day would find me, <br>
        Like him, a-sowin' seeds of hemp? <br>
        Hemp for rope to bind a nation, <br>
        Rope to toll its funeral knell..." (36) </p>
      <p>American ingenuity produced hundreds of hemp-processing
        machines have been patented since Thomas Jefferson recorded his
        improvements of the hemp break. For examples, L. Chichester
        patented his improvements of the device in 1852 and 1854. G.
        Schaffer patented the Cylinder Flax and hemp Dresser in 1861,
        and G. Sanford and J. Mallory patented 10 improvements in hemp
        fiber processing at the same time. </p>
      <p>A brief resurgence of hemp cultivation occurred in the 1870s
        and 80s, when it was widely grown especially in Illinois,
        Nebraska and California. The American Flax and Hemp Spinners'
        and Growers' association was organized in New York by a dozen
        manufacturers and merchants in 1882 and lobbied the government
        the crippled industry. The increasing use of wire cables on
        ships, and the introduction of steamships and metal hulls
        greatly reduced the demand for hemp rope, sails and caulking. By
        the turn of the century the market was limited to cordage, twine
        and thread. (15, 37) </p>
      <p>In February 1937, George Lower reported on the promising
        prospects for hemp in a professional paper entitled "Flax and
        Hemp: From the Seed to the Loom". It was presented to the
        American Society of Mechanical Engineers, and published
        simultaneously in Mechanical Engineering Magazine. The article
        concluded: </p>
      <p>"Paint and lacquer manufacturers are interested in hempseed oil
        which is a good drying agent. When markets have been developed
        for the products now being wasted, seed and hurds, hemp will
        prove, both for the farmer and the public, the most profitable
        crop that can be grown, and one that can make American mills
        independent of importations. </p>
      <p>"Recent floods and dust storms have given warnings against the
        destruction of timber. Possibly, the hitherto waste products of
        flax and hemp may yet meet a good part of that need, especially
        in the plastic field..." (39) </p>
      <p><b>(6) Cannabism in America</b><a name="cannabism"></a> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;In the second half of the 19th century, many thousands of
        Americans rediscovered the ancient pleasures of cannabis in the
        form of hashish and ganja imported from India and Egypt. The
        American diplomat Bayard Taylor wrote an account of his
        experience with hashish in the <i>Land of the Saracens</i>. In
        the chapter on "The Vision of Hashish", Taylor asserted that it
        "revealed to me deeps of rapture and suffering which my natural
        faculties never could have sounded." </p>
      <p>In 1854, at age 18, Fitz Hugh Ludlow read a magazine article by
        Bayard Taylor describing his experience with hashish while in
        Damascus. Ludlow was moved "powerfully to curiosity and
        admiration". After educating himself with the description of
        "Extract of Hemp" in <i>The Dispensatory of the United States</i>,
        he proceeded to experiment with the substance for two years
        until 1857 before quitting his trials, which he later described
        in his memoirs, <i>The Hashish Eater</i>. (40, 41) </p>
      <p>Ludlow's account captured the attention and imagination of many
        curious people, some of whom began to indulge in cannabism. One
        such person was 18-year old John Hay, who found it to be "a
        marvelous stimulant to the imagination". At age 22 he became an
        aide to President Lincoln, and went on to distinguish himself as
        an author, poet, and Secretary of State. </p>
      <p>Ludlow also inspired Thomas B. Aldrich, who was not known to
        use hashish, to abuse his poetic license in a fantasy called <i>Hascheesh</i>,
        which he called "Honey of Paradise, black dew of Hell!" (42) </p>
      <p>The Gunjah Wallah Company of New York began marketing "Hasheesh
        Candy" in the 1860s, and sold the very popular product for 40
        years: </p>
      <p>"The Arabian Gunje of Enchantment confectionized -- A most
        pleasurable and harmless stimulant ¾ Cures Nervousness,
        Weakness, Melancholy, &amp;c. Inspires all classes with new life
        and energy. A complete mental and physical invigorator... Beware
        of imitations..." </p>
      <p>In the 1880s and later, hundreds of secret "hasheesh houses"
        were established to cater to upper class sophisticates in major
        cities. Secrecy was necessary because the police had already
        closed many opium dens after 1875. <i>The Illustrated Police
          News </i>(2 Dec. 1876) printed a drawing captioned "Secret
        Dissipation of New York Belles: Interior of a Hasheesh Hell on
        Fifth Avenue", showing several intoxicated beauties in
        languorous repose on divans, puffing on "hookahs" (water-pipe).
        <i>Harper's Monthly Magazine</i> published an article in
        November 1883 about a hashish-house in New York City,
        where&nbsp; smokers "indulge their morbid appetites". Whoever
        wrote such twaddle evidently knew nothing of the immensely
        popular Turkish Smoking concessions at the World Fairs and
        International Expositions of the period. The 1876 Centennial
        Exposition in Philadelphia featured a fashionable Turkish
        Hashish Exposition that was enjoyed by a great many attendees.
        (43) </p>
      <p>Several women's temperance societies of the 1890s actually
        recommended the recreational use of hashish rather than alcohol,
        because liquor led to wife-beating, whereas hashish did not.
        Cannabis also as considered to be an aphrodisiac, and was touted
        for the purpose in several marriage manuals. In his <i>Marriage
          Guide</i> (1850), the quack doctor Frederick Hollick of
        Philadelphia advised troubled couples to use hashish to
        stimulate their libido, and he advertised a preparation for that
        purpose: </p>
      <p>"The true aphrodisiac, as I compound it, acts upon the brain
        and nervous system, not as a stimulant, but as a tonic and
        nutritive agent, thus sustaining its power and the power of the
        sexual organs also..." (43) </p>
      <p>Its popularity was such that the famed author Louis May Alcott
        (1832-1888) wrote a short story called "Perilous Play" about a
        party of bored young socialites who ate hashish. The tale was
        published anonymously in <i>Frank Leslie's Chimney Corner</i>
        (13 Feb. 1869). Two of the party (Mr. Done and Rose)
        subsequently get lost in each other and in a sailboat, but they
        found true love and their way back. The story ends with their
        blissful return to the party: </p>
      <p>"Oh, Mr. Done, screen me from their eyes and questions as much
        as you can! I'm so worn out and nervous, I shall shall betray
        myself. You will help me?" And she turned to him with a
        confiding look, strangely at variance with her usual calm
        self-possession. </p>
      <p>"I'll shield you with my life, if you will tell me why you took
        the hashish," he said, bent on knowing his fate. </p>
      <p>"I hoped it would make me soft and lovable, like other women.
        I'm tired of being a lonely statue," she faltered, as if the
        truth was wrung from her by a power stronger than her will. </p>
      <p>"And I took it to gain courage to tell my love. Rose, we have
        been near death together; let us share life together, and
        neither of us be any more lonely or afraid?" </p>
      <p>"He stretched his hand to her with his heart in his face, and
        she gave him hers with a look of tender submission, as he said
        ardently, "Heaven bless hashish, if its dreams end like this!"
