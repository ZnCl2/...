      <p>The fiber of Cannabis, the "True Hemp", is tightly woven into
        the tapestry of human life. Since earliest times, this great
        plant ally has provided people with cordage, cloth, paper,
        medicine, and inspiration. </p>
      <p><b>(1) China:</b><a name="china"></a> </p>
      <p>Cannabis Hemp probably evolved in northern China, and was the
        first fiber plant to be cultivated there at the dawn of human
        society. Cotton from India and Mediterranean flax were not
        introduced until thousands of years later. Silk fabric was a
        luxury of the wealthy. The peasants wore hemp clothing. <i>Ma</i>
        (hemp) and mulberry were such important crops that the phrase
        "land of mulberry and hemp" was a synonym for cultivated fields
        and the land of China. </p>
      <p>An abundance of archaeological evidence proves the continuous
        cultivation of hemp from prehistoric times. A 12,000 years old
        Neolithic site unearthed at Yuan-shan (Taiwan) included coarse,
        sandy pottery with hempen cord marks covering the surface, and
        an incised, rod-shaped stone beater used to pound hemp. Among
        the items excavated from a late Neolithic site (ca. 4000 BC) in
        Zhejiang province, several textile articles were found made of
        hemp and silk. The Kung-shan culture of about 4000 years ago
        also left samples of hemp cloth. The agricultural tribes of the
        Lianghzu culture (3300 BC-2300 BC) left proof that they consumed
        hemp in two pottery vessels on the floor of a house in Lin-chia.
        Some carbonized fruits of cannabis were found, indicating that
        the resinous bracts were burnt and the seeds left behind.
        Remains of hemp have been found at sites of the Ch'i-chia, a
        culture of advanced farmers who also raised livestock in eastern
        Kansu. Excavations of four burial pits of the Microlithic
        Culture of Inner Mongolia recovered remains of objects of
        leather, silk, and hemp. (1-4) </p>
      <p>One of the most ancient books, Shu Chingi (dated ca. 2300 BC)
        states that the land in Shantung province is "whitish and
        rich... with silk, hemp, lead, pine trees and strange stones..."
        Its people paid tribute to their rulers with hemp. The warlords'
        armies were dressed in armor sewn with hemp cord, and their bows
        were strung with hemp strings that were far superior to the
        bamboo fiber they replaced. Coats, bucklers and helmets were
        made of hemp&nbsp; prepared with vinegar to strengthen it. Hemp
        was grown around every lord's castle to provide for their
        military needs. (7) </p>
      <p>The Shang culture (1400-1100 BC) on the flood plain of the
        Huangho River was a self-sufficient agricultural economy that
        developed a hemp-weaving industry. Excavation of the Shang site
        at Taixi (Hebei province) produced fragments of burnt hempen
        fabric. Analysis revealed that the Shang people had developed
        better methods of preparing the fiber by soaking it in ponds. </p>
      <p>A number of clay and stone spinning whorls were found intact at
        the Taixi Shang site. A spindle was inserted through a center
        hole and the implement was held in the left hand and spun while
        fiber was fed onto it with the right hand. The technology was so
        advanced that several types of whorls were used to make
        different hempen fabrics. A roll of hemp cloth in 13 pieces also
        was recovered. Tombs of the Western Chou period (110-770 BC) at
        Yuntang village (Shaanxi) were found to contain a spindle whorl
        made from an earthenware shard, and a jar decorated with fine
        hemp fabric markings. </p>
      <p>More than a thousand mortuary objects were recovered from a
        Chou tomb site at Hsin-Ts'un near An-Yang. The inventory
        included articles of hemp among those of gold, jade, marble,
        silk, lacquer and other valuable materials. The inner coffin was
        made of wooden planks reinforced with bands of hemp cloth that
        were fastened to the coffin with lacquer. A late Western Chou
        dynasty grave discovered in Shansi province contained bronze
        vessels, weapons, jade, pottery, and a tightly woven fragment of
        hemp cloth. Bronze objects protected with silk and hemp
        wrappings were found at other Chou cemetary sites. </p>
      <p>Archaeologists discovered a tomb at Chengjiao (Hubei)
        containing charcoal and some decomposed fragments of a fabric
        mixture of silk and hemp laying on top of a layer of red
        cinnabar, revealing an awareness of alchemy. Chinese alchemists
        performed rituals&nbsp; to prepare for their experiments,
        especially with cinnabar. One such rite was a solemn dance
        titled "Method of Steaming Hemp according to Su Nu". The 6th
        century Taoist collection <i>Wu Shang Pi Yao</i> (Essentials of
        the Matchless Books) states that alchemists added hemp to their
        incense. A text by Ko Hung gives warning, that "Hemp seed oil
        spoils wine." </p>
      <p>During the Eastern Chou period (770-481 BC), the territory of
        the Yangtze and Han rivers were developed, and an early
        historian noted that the people there had to "labor in wooden
        carts and tattered hempen cloths to bring the hills and forest
        under cultivation." </p>
      <p>The oldest pharmacopia in existence, the Pen-Ts'ao Ching (ca.
        100 BC) was compiled from ancient fragments attributed to the
        legendary Emperor Shen-Nung (ca. 2300 BC). The book mentions
        that "hemp grows along rivers and valleys at T'ai-shan, but it
        is now common everywhere." Mount T'ai (Shantung province) is one
        of the oldest locations where hemp was grown in historical
        times. The book also mentions <i>ma-pho</i>, a term that means
        a sudden change of mood, such as intoxication. At the same time
        the word can be explained as dehisence, the sudden blooming of
        male hemp. The ancient Chinese naturally discovered the
        medicinal and psychic properties of the resinous bracts, which
        they called <i>ma-fen</i>. Another find from the Eastern Chou
        dynasty (Shansi province) contained several hundred pieces of
        jade and stone "oath documents" with red inscriptions that
        mention <i>ma</i> with the character for "negative" attached to
        it. This suggests that the undignified psychoactive effect of
        the plant was well known to them. (8, 9) </p>
      <p>Western Han tombs at Yinqueshan (Linyi) were found to contain
        pottery filled with hempseed and other grains. The
        well-preserved body of a Han woman, discovered in a tomb in
        Changsa (Hunan) was accompanied by more than a thousand funeral
        items, among them jars of hempseed. </p>
      <p>The ancient Chinese farmers utilized their best land to grow
        food, and the rest was cultivated with hemp for its fiber, seed
        and medicine. Men harvested the crop, and during the winter the
        women wove the fiber into cloth. </p>
      <p>In the <i>Shih Ching</i> (Book of Odes), a compilation of 305
        songs composed between 1000-500 BC, hemp is mentioned 7 times.
        One poem states that to soak hemp to remove the glue is a
        woman's task. Another poem says, "The pond at the East Gate, can
        be used to soak the hemp." Four variations for ma are given in
        the first dictionary, <i>Shuo-wen chieh-tzu</i>, compiled by
        Hsu Shen in the Eastern Han period. The <i>Chi-chiu-pien</i>, a
        primer composed in the first century BC for teaching and
        writing, lists rice, millet and hemp in one sentence. Government
        records of the Han period show that a roll of rough to medium
        hemp cloth cost about 300-400 cash, and plain silk cost slightly
        more than medium hemp fabric. (10) </p>
      <p>The invention of vegetable fiber paper emerged during the Han
        dynasty when people became frustrated with the bulk and weight
        of wooden and bamboo tablets and the expensive rarity of <i>zhi</i>&nbsp;





        (proto-paper). The dynastic history Hou-Han Shu attributes the
        invention of paper in 105 AD to Marquis Cai Lun, who was prefect
        of the masters of Techniques during the reign of Emperor He Di.
        Archaeologists, however, have recovered older specimens of hemp
        paper from the Western and Eastern Han periods in Xinjiang,
        Inner Mongolia, and Shaanxi, so it is apparent that Cai Lun
        actually supervised the art of papermaking by craftsmen, though
        he also worked to promote its use in the imperial bureaucracy.
        According to the Hou-Han Shu, "He submitted the process to the
        emperor in the first year of Yuan-Hsing and received praise for
        his ability. From this time, paper has been in use everywhere
        and is universally called 'the paper of Marquis Cai'". (11, 12)
      </p>
      <p>The Hou-Han Shu relates the apocryphal story of Cai Lun's
        attempts to introduce true hemp paper in a memorial to the
        court. With the help of some friends, Cai Lun pretended to die
        and was buried alive. The coffin was fitted with a secret bamboo
        tube that allowed Cai Lun to breathe while he waited. His
        friends announced that if paper was burned, it would resurrect
        the dead man. The mourners were dubious but did as was
        suggested; then the coffin was exhumed. Cai Lun thanked the
        astounded witnesses for their faith in his miraculous paper, and
        its subsequent acceptance was thus assured. The Chinese
        customarily burn paper over graves during burial ceremonies.
        (13) </p>
      <p>Perhaps the oldest specimens of paper extant, dating more than
        a century earlier than Cai Lun, were discovered in a tomb near
        Xian (Shensi). The pieces were found under three bronze mirrors
        that were wrapped in hemp cloth. The tomb is dated no later than
        the reign of Wu Di (Western Han Dynasty, 140-87 BC). Several
        archaeological finds support the literary evidence of the
        Hou-Han Shu. The excavation of a ruined watchtower in Tsakhortei
        unearthed a specimen of paper bearing writing contemporary with
        Cai Lun. Another piece from the Late Han period was found with a
        mummy in a tomb in Min-feng (Sinkiang). Other remarkable
        specimens were nailed in three layers with wooden strips on the
        side of an ox-cart. The samples are white and much thinner than
        earlier examples. </p>
      <p>Other common papermaking materials in the Han period included
        paper mulberry and ramie. Rattan was introduced in the Chin
        period, but hemp remained the primary material for paper
        manufacture. After the T'ang period, however, the use of hemp in
        paper declined and was replaced by bamboo. Su I-Chien, author of
        <i>Wen Fang Su Phu</i>, the first treatise about paper, wrote
        that "hemp was used in Szechuan, bamboo in Chiangsu, mulberry
        bark in the north, rattan in Shan-chi, and seaweed by people of
        the south." Later periods also used jute and China grass. But
        hemp paper is pliable, tough, fine and waterproof, and these
        characteristics made it popular and preferred for use in
        official documents, books and calligraphy. The book <i>Hsin
          Thang Shu</i> says that the Chin dynasty court provided the
        scholars in the Academy of Assembled Worthies with 5000 sheets
        of hemp paper each month. Hemp paper made in I-Chou (Szechuan)
        was used for all the books in the imperial library in the
        Khai-Yuan period (713-742 AD) (Ref. 8) </p>
      <p>According to the <i>Li Chi</i> (Record of Rites, ca. 150 BC),
        in ancient times people wore skins and feathers until sages
        invented hemp and silk fabric. The record states that hempseed
        was used by kings in a ritual diet during certain months. The <i>Li




          Chi</i> ordained that people mourning the death of a parent
        should wear hemp clothing. In the ancient Chinese cult of the
        dead, tradition requires a surviving son to put the father in a
        hempen sack and consume a portion of his flesh, but the practice
        changed and put the bag over the son instead, without
        cannibalism. Now it is customary for a mourning son to wear
        coarse hemp (ma-po) on his head. Other mourners must wear other
        kinds of cloth such as silk or muslin. (Ref. 14) </p>
      <p>The use of hempseed as a food staple diminished greatly by the
        6th century AD, though it persisted at least until the 10th
        century. Eventually hempseed was replaced by less oily grains,
        and its nutritional value was largely forgotten. The Southern
        Ch'i dynasty (470-502 AD) history <i>Nan-Ch'i shu</i> mentions
        a porridge made of hempseed. </p>
      <p>Because of disastrous flooding in 10 AD, the ruler Wang Mang
        instituted the so-called "Six Controls" to fix the prices of
        several commodities including hemp. After the downfall of his
        regime, hemp, silk and grains were used as money. </p>
      <p>The excavation of a group of tombs in Astana (Turfan) in 1973
        turned up pieces of hempen paper money dating to the 6th
        century. </p>
      <p>Ma also figured in the early development of medicine. The great
        physician Hua Tuo (141-208 AD) formulated <i>ma-yo</i> (hemp
        wine) and <i>ma-fei-san</i> ("hemp boiling powder") with
        cannabis and aconite for use as an anaesthetic for the surgeries
        he performed. (Ref.16) </p>
      <p>The Chinese Materia Medica <i>Pen Ts'ao</i>, attributed to
        Emperor Shen Nung, classifies <i>ma</i> as both yin (female, <i>chu-ma</i>)
        and yang (male, <i>i-ma</i>). He advises that the Chinese
        cultivate only the female plant because it provides more of the
        medicinal virtue, which he prescribed for mental weakness,
        menstrual problems, constipation, gout, rheumatism, beri-beri
        and malaria. He also classified chu-ma as one of the Superior
        Elixirs of Immortality. A late edition of the <i>Pen Ts'ao</i>
        adds this note: </p>
      <p>"To take much makes people see demons and throw themselves
        about like maniacs. But if one takes it over a long period of
        time one can communicate with the spirits, gain insight, and
        one's body becomes light." </p>
      <p>The 7th century physician Meng Shen advised that one should eat
        hempseed for at least 3 months so as to see spirits. The 6th
        century <i>Wu Tsang Ching</i> (Manual of the Five Viscera)
        attributed to Chang Chung-Ching states: </p>
      <p>"If you wish to command demonic apparitions to present
        themselves you should constantly eat the flowers of the hemp
        plant." </p>
      <p>T'ao Hung-Ching, the most eminent Taoist magician of the 5th
        century, noted hemp in his <i>Ming-i pieh-lu</i>: </p>
      <p>"Hempseeds are little used in medicine, but the magicians say
        that if one consumes them with ginseng it will give one
        preternatural knowledge of events in the future." </p>
      <p>The majority of Chinese people, however, were under the
        sobering influence of Taoist and Confucian religions and
        considered such a state of intoxication to be shameful. The
        shamanic use of Cannabis fell into neglect while the more
        tranquil opium rose in favor instead. Traditional Chinese
        medicine uses the Mung bean (Semen Phaseoli radiatus) as an
        antidote for cannabis intoxication.(17) </p>
      <p>Historian Joseph Needham attributes the establishment of Mount
        Shao as the first&nbsp; center of Taoist practice (ca. 350 AD)
        in part to the use of cannabis by the sage Yang Hsi; he enjoyed
        a series of visions of Lady Wei, the Mao brothers, and other
        members of the pantheon who transmitted sacred texts through
        him. (8) </p>
      <p>Hemp is mentioned in the <i>Lun Yu</i> (Analects) of
        Confucius. A fragment of the <i>Lun Yu</i> written in 716 AD on
        bleached white hemp paper was found in a cemetary at Tirfan in
        Sinkiang province. The same site also yielded a beautiful pair
        of hemp paper shoes sewn with hemp threads. Despite other
        religionists attitude toward the resin, in 770 AD they deemed to
        publish the first printed book, <i>Dharani</i>, a collection of
        prayers, on hemp paper. </p>
      <p>The peerless fibers of hemp remain at the very core and epitome
        of Chinese culture, in their lacquerware. Chinese lacquer is the
        sap of the Rhus verniciferas tree, which is strained through a
        sheet of hempen cloth to purify it. Then it is heated and
        stirred to homogenize and thicken it for application over a core
        of hemp fiber. Most lacquer xu cups were made in this way.
        Excavation of an Early Western Han tomb at Lao-fu-shan&nbsp;
        (Kiansi) uncovered over 200 grave goods including several winged
        cups on hemp cloth cores. Dozens of realistic clay sculptures
        were found in a T'ang monastery in Shansi, made on wooden cores
        reinforced with iron wire and nails, hempen cords, and minced
        straw. (18) </p>
      <p>Cotton did not arrive in China until the 9th century AD, when
        female ambassadors from Indochina presented the Emperor with
        tribute made from "refined water fragrant hemp" that probably
        was cotton, not cannabis. (19) </p>
      <p>The cultivation of cotton was slow to spread throughout China.
        According to the account by Wu T'seng-ch'eng, the Chinese exiles
        who fled into Manchuria about 1600 found that most of the
        indigenes used animal skins for clothing. Only the wealthy among
        them wore hemp cloth and padded their dresses with it during the
        winter. </p>
      <p>Babur, the first Mongol and a descendant of the Mongols Genghis
        Khan and Tamerlane, occasionally ate hemp sweetmeats and drank a
        tincture of hemp and opium. Babur began his regimen at age 25
        (ca. 1505 AD). When using hemp, Babur abstained from alcohol,
        which he called his "death in life". </p>
      <p>Chinese fishers and traders sailed along the rivers and coast
        of China in boats rigged with hemp. In 1979 a 7th century Sui
        ship was found at Pingdu (Shandong), caulked with hemp bark
        rope. </p>
      <p><b>(2) Korea &amp; Japan ~</b><a name="korea"></a> </p>
      <p>Korean papermakers used materials and technologies similar to
        those of the Chinese hemp, paper mulberry, bamboo, rice straw,
        and seaweed. A few fragments of early Korean hemp paper have
        been recovered by archaeologists, including a thick, strong,
        bleached and glossy piece of <i>Chi-Lin chih</i> (Paper from
        the Silla Kingdom). This was an item of tribute to the Chinese,
        whose scholars and artists prized its fine quality. The <i>Fei
          Fu Yu Lueh</i> notes that the Ming artist Tung Chi-Chang used
        Chi-Lin for his paintings. </p>
      <p>Sailors brought hemp to Japan, where it was called <i>asa</i>,
        and plays a part in many rituals and stories. For example,
        according to Japanese legend, the earthworm has a white ring
        around its neck because of hemp. Once there were two women who
        both wove hemp cloth, which was called nuno or jofu. One woman
        worked very slowly and produced fine fabric, while the other
        woman worked quickly to produce coarse cloth. When market day
        arrived, the slow woman had not woven enough fine cloth to wear,
        so she insisted that her husband carry her on his back in a huge
        jar. She went naked except for the hemp fibers around her neck.
        But the slow woman foolishly mocked the dress of coarse fabric
        produced by the fast woman. She in turn exposed the nakedness of
        the slow woman, who buried herself in the earth to hide in
        shame; she turned into the earthworm. The hemp fibers became the
        worm's white ring. </p>
      <p>According to Japanese tradition, hemp is associated with purity
        and plays a symbolic role in their customs of courtship. In
        earlier times, the man's family would send hempen articles as
        gifts to the woman's family to show that she was acceptable to
        them. Strands of the fiber were arrayed at the wedding to
        symbolize the wife's obedience to her husband. Hemp is easily
        dyed, and Japanese men expected their wives to take on any
        "color" the man chose. (13) </p>
      <p><b>(3) India ~</b><a name="india"></a> </p>
      <p>Cannabis hemp apparently was brought to India from the Chinese
        Turkestan by migrants about 3500 years ago. The <i>Mahabharata</i>
        tells of the Sakas (Scythians from Turkestan) bringing gifts of
        hemp thread when they visited India. The earliest Aryan name for
        hemp is <i>bhanga</i>, derived from the Aryan word <i>an</i>
        or <i>bhanj</i> (to break, transitive). The modern term
        "cannabis" developed from the Sanskrit <i>sana</i> or <i>cana</i>.
        The name of Bengal means "Bhang Land" (Bangala); Bangladesh
        means "Bhang Land People". </p>
      <p>The bhang plant is said to have been produced as a shape of
        Amrita nectar when the gods churned the ocean with Mount
        Mandara. A drop of nectar spilled onto Earth and bhang sprouted
        on the spot. It is the favorite food of the deity Indra, and its
        nectar has been called Indracana. According to myth, Indracana
        had different colors in each age or cosmic cycle. At first bhang
        was white, then red, then yellow. In this Kali Yuga, it is
        green. </p>
      <p>The 17th century Hindu text Rajvallabha describes it thus: </p>
      <p>"Indracana is acid, produces infatuation and destroys leprosy.
        It created vital energy, increases mental powers and internal
        heat, corrects irregularities of the phlegmatic humor and is an
        elixir of life... Inasmuch as it is believed to give victory in
        the three worlds and to bring delight to Shiva, it was called
        victorious. This desire-fulfilling drug was believed to have
        been obtained by men on earth for the welfare of all people...
        To those who use it regularly, it begets joy and diminishes
        anxiety. [They] attain insight, lose all fear, and have their
        sexual desires excited." </p>
      <p>The oldest known reference to bhang in India is found in the <i>Atharva-Veda</i>
        (Science of Charms) circa 1400 BC: </p>
      <p>"We speak to the five kingdoms of the plants with Soma as the
        most excellent among them. The dharba-grass, hemp, and mighty
        barley; they shall deliver us from calamity!" (Book XI) </p>
      <p>"May the bhang and may the gangida protect us against diseases
        and all the Demons! The one is brought hither from the forest,
        the other [bhang] from the sap of the furrow." (Book II.4.5)
        (20-22) </p>
      <p>Throughout Asia, vagabond mendicants dressed only in loincloth
        eat drink, and smoke bhang to warm themselves against cold
        weather. Hindu <i>sanyasia mahanta</i> and <i>mantra-data</i>
        gurus, yogis and fakirs are well respected despite their regular
        use of ganja for the express purpose of enhancing their
        meditations. A Buddhist legend claims that Gautama Buddha ate
        only one hemp seed each day for six years during his ascetic
        period. (13, 23) </p>
      <p>The yogic system of Tantra Sastra has the primary objective of
        regulating the functions of the mind, and certain drugs,
        including cannabis, are prescribed for the purpose. Tantric
        texts divide the plant into four types and say a different
        mantra for each one. The Brahmana type is white, the Ksatriya is
        red, the Vaisra is green, and the Sudra is black. </p>
      <p><i>The Indian Hemp Drugs Commission Report</i> (1893-94)
        summarized the Hindu opinion of cannabis most eloquently: </p>
      <p>"To the Hindu the hemp plant is holy. A guardian lives in the
        bhang leaf... To meet someone carrying bhang is a sure omen of
        success... To see in a dream the leaves, plant, or water of
        bhang is lucky; it brings the goddess of wealth into the
        dreamer's power... A longing for bhang foretells happiness... No
        good thing can come to the man who treads underfoot the holy
        bhang leaf. </p>
      <p>"Yogis take deep draughts of bhang that they may center their
        thoughts on the Eternal... By help of bhang, ascetics pass days
        without food or drink. </p>
      <p>"Besides being a cure for fever, bhang has many medicinal
        virtues... It cures dysentary and sunstroke, clears phlegm,
        quickens digestion, sharpens appetite, makes the tongue of the
        lisper plain, freshens the intellect, and gives alertness to the
        body and gaiety to the mind. Such are the useful and needful
        ends for which in his goodness the Almighty made bhang... It is
        inevitable that temperaments should be found to whom the
        quickening spirit of bhang is the spirit of freedom and
        knowledge. In the ecstasy of bhang the spark of the Eternal in
        man turns into light the murkiness of matter... Bhang is the
        Joygiver, the Skyflier, the Heavenly Guide, the Poor Man's
        Heaven, the Soother of Grief... No god or man is as good as the
        religious drinker of bhang. The students of scriptures at
        Benares are given bhang before they sit to study. At Benares,
        Ujjain and other holy places, yogis, bairagis and sanyasis take
        deep draughts of bhang that they may center their thoughts on
        the Eternal... By the help of bhang, ascetics pass days without
        food or drink. The supporting power of bhang has brought many a
        Hindu family safe through the miseries of famine. To forbid or
        even seriously to restrict the use of so holy and gracious an
        herb as the hemp would cause widespread suffering and annoyance
        and to large bands of worshipped ascetics, deep-seated anger. It
        would rob the people of a solace in discomfort, of a cure in
        sickness, of a guardian whose gracious protection saves them
        from the attacks of evil influences... So grand a result, so
        tiny a sin! </p>
      <p>"These beliefs the Musalman devotee shares to the full. Like
        his Hindu brother, the Musalman fakir reveres bhang as the
        lengthener of life; the freer from the bonds of self. Bhang
        brings union with the Divine Spirit." </p>
      <p>The Report studied the feasibility of imposing a tax on hemp
        products, but abandoned the idea as unprofitable. One of the
        commissioners, Raja Soshi Roy, argued that Moslem law and Hindu
        custom, and the Vedas forbid the taxation of anything that gives
        pleasure to the poor. (49) </p>
      <p>In the <i>Rig-Veda</i> (XI, 61.13), bhang is called "the
        healing herb." </p>
      <p>In ancient times the preparation of hemp resin was a secret of
        the Brahmin priests, who restricted its public use by allowing
        bhang to be used only occasionally and in limited quantities as
        an offering in religious celebrations such as the Kali,
        Durja-Puja, and Vijaya Dasmi festivals. Among his myriad
        epithets, Shiva is known as "Lord of Bhang". On the final day of
        the Durja-Puja the idols are thrown into water and the Hindus
        visit their friends and relatives. It behooves the host to offer
        a cup of bhang drink and a dish of majoon sweets to the
        visitors, or be considered unsociable. (25-28) </p>
      <p>The 17th century German physician Englebert Kaemper, who was a
        fleet surgeon for the Dutch East India Company, observed the use
        of bhang in a spectacular ritual performance for the god Vishnu:
      </p>
      <p>"At the time of the sacrifices in honor of Vishnu, virgins
        pleasant to behold and richly adorned, were brought to the
        temple of the Brahmins. They came out in public to appease the
        god who rules over plenty and fine weather. To impress the
        spectators, these young women were previously given a
        preparation with a basis of hemp and datura, and when the priest
        saw certain symptoms, he began his invocations. The Devadessy
        (the term for these girls) then danced, leapt about yelling,
        contorted their limbs, and foaming at the mouth, their eyes
        ecstatic, committed all sorts of eccentricities. Finally, the
        priests carried the exhausted virgins into a sanctuary, gave
        them a potion to destroy the effect of the previous one, and
        then showed them again to the people in their right mind, so
        that the crowd of spectators might believe that the demons had
        fled and the idol was appeased." (29) </p>
      <p>The Dutch East India Company made contracts for "Himalayan
        hemp", paid advances to the cultivators, and purchased the
        fibers at a fixed rate. It was concluded: </p>
      <p>"The system worked well, and should a demand arise in the
        future, it might be resumed as the best mode of dealing with a
        community of very poor cultivators" (emphasis added) (30) </p>
      <p>Garcia Da Orta (1501-1568) was a Portuguese military surgeon
        who retired to the island of Goa and wrote his classic
        Colloquies on the Simples and Drugs of India. Therein he brought
        bhang to the attention of Europeans: </p>
      <p>"Bangue... makes a man laugh foolishly and lifts him above all
        cares and worries... I hear that many women take it when they
        want to dally and flirt with men... I've heard it said, although
        it may not be true, that the great captains, in ancient times,
        used to drink it with wine or opium so that they could get some
        rest from their work, banish their cares, and get to sleep."
        (31) </p>
      <p>Da Orta's colleague Cristobal Acosta (1524-1594) also wrote of
        hemp in his textbook <i>On the Drugs and Medicines from the
          East Indies</i> (1578): </p>
      <p>"Some take it to forget their worries and sleep without
        thoughts; others to enjoy in their sleep a variety of dreams and
        delusions; others have become drunk and act like merry jesters;
        others because of love sickness." (32) </p>
      <p>The Irish physician Sir William O'Shaughnessy, a professor of
        chemistry at the Medical College of Calcutta (1838-1842), helped
        introduce cannabis to European medicine. He described it thus: </p>
      <p>"The Majoon or hemp confection, is a compound of sugar, butter,
        flour, milk and siddhi or bhang. The process has been repeatedly
        performed before us by Ameer, the proprietor of a celebrated
        place of resort for hemp devotees in Calcutta and who is
        considered the best artist of his profession... Almost
        invariably the inebriation is of the most cheerful kind, causing
        the person to sing and dance, to eat food with great relish, and
        to seek aphrodisiac enjoyments. In persons of a quarrelsome
        nature it occasions, as might be expected, an exasperation of
        their natural tendency. The intoxication lasts about three
        hours, when sleep intervenes. No nausea or sickness of the
        stomach succeeds, nor are the bowels at all affected; next day
        there is slight giddiness and vascularity of the eyes, but no
        other symptoms worth recording." (33) </p>
      <p>The people of India prepare bhang in several ways, for eating,
        drinking, or smoking: Bhang (or, siddhi) consists of the dried
        leaves ; it is smoked alone o mixed with tobacco. Bhang also is
        the name for a drink made from the leaves, and usually includes
        spices. The more potent ganja consists of the flowers of the
        female plant. Charas is the resin, collected from ganja by
        rubbing it onto cloth or leather aprons worn by the harvesters.
        Just after sunrise, while dew is on the plants, the men pass
        through the field and crush the plants against them. The
        accumulated resin is scraped off and consolidated by kneading it
        into various forms. Sometimes the flowers are rubbed between the
        hands or beaten over a cloth. The grey-white power that falls is
        collected and compressed into cakes. </p>
      <p>Over the centuries, the people of India and their neighbors
        have developed hundreds of recipes containing bhang. Other
        powerful psychoactive ingredients sometimes are mixed into
        hashish, and they strongly influence the effects that are
        produced. Some of the negative effects attributed to hashish are
        caused by other substances including large doses of opium,
        datura, betel nut, aconite, nux vomica, and spices such as
        nutmeg, mace, and even cantharides ("Spanish fly"), arsenic or
        mercury. (34) </p>
      <p>The traditional Hindu method of cultivating bhang is a complex
        ritual process. Select seeds which have been kept in the mouth
        of a snake are sown during an auspicious day during the waxing
        moon in July. The person who has performed the appropriate rites
        (nyasa and acamana) must face north or east and meditate. Water
        mixed with milk is sprinkled over the seeds. When they begin to
        sprout, they are sprinkled with water mixed with milk. When they
        sprout, water mixed with clarified butter is used. When the
        first leaves appear, the plants are sprinkled with salt water.
        During flowering, they are sprinkled with water mixed with
        alcohol and meat, then with water and honey, and finally with
        water and alcohol. Four rites are performed at the harvest
        (stepana, sevana, tantubandhana, and lavana). The third rite
        (Tantubandhana, "tieing the tree with fibers") should be
        performed on the 14th day of the waning moon in Phalguna
        (February-March)&nbsp; by a person who has bathed, dressed in
        clean clothing, applied perfume and sacrificed meat and alcohol
        to Bhairava. The plants are tied with red, yellow, black and
        white threads. Then the Aghora mantra should be recited for a
        week. On the fifth day of the waxing moon, the cultivator should
        meditate on the bhang and imagine her as a deity. Finally, when
        the seeds are fat, the plant is harvested while again reciting
        the Aghora mantra. </p>
      <p>Cultivators of bhang in India hire a podddar ("ganja doctor")
        to inspect their plants and rogue all the males before flowering
        commences. Only the virgin female madi are allowed to mature. On
        his first visit to a field, the poddar looks for anomalous
        female flowers on male plants or vice versa. Sometimes the
        farmers stick a knife through the stem near the base of the
        plant and insert a wooden wedge or a nail. Sometimes opium,
        mercury, sulfur, arsenic, or asafoetida is stuffed into the
        crack to increase the potency of the resin. It is a widespread
        practice to bury a dead snake under the hemp plants when
        transplanting them, because it is believed that the venom makes
        the resin more potent. (26, 35, 36) </p>
      <p>The Indian Hemp Drugs Commission found that after deducting for
        fiber production, the total area under cultivation for resin
        scarcely exceeded 6000 acres. By 1936, hardly 1600 acres were
        under cultivation. By 1945, the area was reduced to about 650
        acres, and the estimated yield was one million kilograms of
        leaves and flowers. There was no need to cultivate hemp for
        fiber: </p>
      <p>"[In Kashmir,] the bhang is known as kathiya bhang, is weak in
        narcotic and is used only for its fiber and for burning. The
        wild growth is very abundant. It supplies all the wants of the
        people, and there is consequently no cultivation." (37) </p>
      <p><b>(4) The Middle East ~</b><a name="mideast"></a> </p>
      <p>The Aryans who invaded India also penetrated the Middle East
        and Europe, sowing hempseed everywhere they went. Someone else,
        however, introduced cannabis to Mesopotamia at a much earlier
        date. One of the oldest archaeological relics in existence is a
        fragment of hemp cloth found in Catal Hayuk and dated to about
        8000 BC. The plant is mentioned in Assyrian texts, where it is
        called <i>qu-nu-bu</i> in a "a drug for grief". Other formulas
        used qu-nu-bu as a stomachic, aphrodisiac, poultice for
        swelling, and as a fumigant. The Phrygian tribes who invaded the
        Hittite empire about 1100 BC also wove with true hemp fiber.
        Excavation of the Phrygian city of Gordion near Ankara (Turkey)
        produced hempen fabrics from the late 8th century BC. According
        to Dr Robert Walton, cannabis is mentioned in cuneiform tablets
        dating from 650 BC that are generally regarded as obvious copies
        of much older texts"; the tablets were found in the library of
        Babylonian emperor Ashurbanipal. Hemp also was known as <i>azallu</i>
        in the Akkadian tongue, cognate with the Syrian <i>azal</i>
        ("To spin"). Hemp is called <i>kanfai</i> in Syriac and
        Aramaic. In Persia the seeds were called Shahdanah ("Emperor's
        seeds"). (38, 39) </p>
      <p>There is some confusion concerning of the names of hemp in the
        cultures of the Middle East, particularly with the Old Indic <i>bhanga</i>
        or Sanskrit <i>sana</i> (hemp) and the Avestan <i>banha</i>
        ("an abortive plant", henbane), which also is called <i>bang</i>
        in Middle and New Persian, and <i>banj</i> in Arabic. The
        Sumerian term for hemp is <i>gan-zi-gun-na</i>; in Persian it
        is called <i>grgainj</i>. Hemp as <i>qu-nu-bu</i> was
        mentioned in letter written to the mother of the Assyrian king
        Esarhaddon circa 680 BC and preserved in the royal archives.
        (43) </p>
      <p>Even as in China and India, cannabis has had a profound
        influence on the development of human spiritual sensibilities.
        In the Middle East (Persia and south). One surviving book of the
        Persian prophet Zoroaster's <i>Zend Avesta</i> (7th cty. BC),
        titled <i>Vendidad</i> ("The Law Against Demons"), praises
        bhanga as "Zoroaster's good narcotic". <i>The Book of Artay
          Viraf</i> tells us of Gustaph and Ardu Viraf, who drank wine
        and the "narcotic of Vishtasp" (thought to be hemp, or perhaps
        opium) and were "transported in soul to the heavens. The highest
        mysteries were revealed to them" during a sleep that lasted
        seven days. (40, 41) </p>
      <p>The use of <i>bhanga</i> to induce euphoria and "righteous
        action" is mentioned in <i>Din Yast</i>, a devotional book
        dedicated to the goddess Kista: </p>
      <p>"To whom the holy Hvevi [Zarathustra's wife] did sacrifice with
        full knowledge, wishing that the holy Zarathustra would give her
        his good narcotic, bhanga... that she might think according to
        the law, speak according to the law, and do according to the
        law." </p>
      <p>In the <i>Din Yast</i>, god Ahura Mazda is said to be "without
        trance and without hemp". The <i>Fravasi Yast</i> mentions one
        who is a <i>poura-bangha</i> ("a possessor of much hemp"). </p>
      <p>Ibn Wahshiyah (10th cty. AD) wrote of hashish, the potent
        preparation of cannabis resin in his book <i>On Poisons</i>,
        and he claimed that the "odor" (vapor) is deadly. His
        description, however, bears no resemblance to hashish
        intoxication. Some exotic formulas for the preparation of
        cannabis (especially as an aphrodisiac) include admixtures of
        dangerous substances that produce toxic reactions such as he
        described. </p>
      <p>The <i>Aqrabadhin of Al-Samarqandi</i>, an early Arabic
        medical formulary, recommends hempseed as a "purging clyster"
        (enema) to be administered in cases of cold colic. (44) </p>
      <p>The Persian saint Haydar, founder of the Sufi Hadari set, is
        given legendary credit for discovering the mental effects of
        hemp resin in 1155. Haydar was an extreme recluse who for ten
        years never left his mountain monastery in Persia. Then one day
        the hermit became very depressed and went for a walk to be alone
        from his disciples. When he returned, he was very happy and even
        invited his pupils into his private rooms for the first time.
        They asked him what had brought about this change of
        temperament. Haydar explained that while he was walking he
        noticed one plant that seemed to dance in the sweltering heat
        while all others stood torpid. His curiosity aroused, Haydar
        picked and ate a few leaves of the plant and thus discovered the
        surpassing pleasure that is in hemp. Before he died in 1221 AD,
        Haydar requested that cannabis be planted around his sepulcher
        so that his spirit could rest in the shade of the blessed herb
        that had graced his life. Thus hashish became a sacrament to the
        Sufis. Sometimes they call it 'the wine of Haydar". One Moslem
        sect considers benj to be the incarnation of Kizer, spirit of
        the prophet and the patron saint of water. </p>
      <p>The Moslem faith forbids the use of alcohol but allows for
        cannabis (<i>Koran</i>, ch. 5). The rich indulge in alcohol
        anyway, though it is expensive. The poor resort to cannabis to
        mitigate their plight. A Turkish poet expressed the sentiment
        thus: </p>
      <p>"Hashish is the friend of the poor, the dervishes and the men
        of knowledge, that is, all who are not blessed with earthly
        goods and social power." </p>
      <p>The sage al-Is'rid advised likewise: </p>
      <p>"Do not listen to what the critics may say with respect to it.
        They want to keep you away from it. Disobey any old censor." </p>
      <p>Bhang and hashish figure in several tales in the wonerful <i>Book
of
the





          Thousand and One Nights</i>, a collection of Arabic stories
        compiled between the 11th and 18th centuries. One of the
        anecdotes, "The Tale of the Hashish Eater", is about a beggar
        who wandered into a bath-house when no one else was about. He
        ate some hashish, fell asleep, and dreamed that he had a girl in
        his arms: </p>
      <p>"When lo! He heard one saying to him, 'Awake, thou
        ne'er-do-well! The noon hour is come and you are still asleep'.
        He opened his eyes and found himself lying on the marge of the
        cold-water tank, amongst a crowd of people all laughing at him;
        for his prickle was at point and the napkin had slipped from his
        middle. So he knew that all this was but a confusion of dreams
        and an illusion of Hashish and he was vexed and said to him who
        had aroused him, 'Would thou hadst waited till I had put it in!'
        Then said the folk, 'Art thou not ashamed, O Hashish-eater, to
        be sleeping stark naked with stiff-standing tool?' And they
        cuffed him till his neck was red. Now he was starving, yet
        forsooth he had savored the flavor of pleasure in his dream..."
      </p>
      <p>On the 835th night, Sharazad told the story of Khalifah the
        Fisherman of Bagdad, who had earned 100 dinars and was trying to
        keep it a secret. He devised a plan to pretend that he had been
        robbed: </p>
      <p>"He lay one night in his lodging much bemused with hashish...
        And his Hashish said to him, 'Rise, doff thy dress.' So he stood
        up and putting off his clothes, took a whip he had by him...
        then he fell to lashing himself..." </p>
      <p>In "The Sleeper and the Waker", bhang was used as a knockout
        drug: </p>
      <p>"The Caliph crowned a cup, and putting therein a piece of
        Cretan Bhang, gave it to his host and said to him, 'My life on
        thee, O my brother, drink this cup from my hand!' and Abu
        al-Hasan answered, 'Ay, by thy life, I will drink it from thy
        hand.' So he took it and drank it off; but hardly had it settled
        in his stomach, when his head forewent his heels and he fell to
        the ground like one slain..." </p>
      <p>On the 503rd night (Supplemental), Sharazad told the tale of a
        clever woman who outwitted the 40 Thieves in the same manner: </p>
      <p>"She brought them coffee which they drank, but hardly had it
        settled in their maws when the 40 Thieves fell to the ground,
        for she had mixed it with Banj al-tayyar [Flying Bhang], and
        those who had drunk thereof became like unto dead men." </p>
      <p>"Flying Bhang" was so-called because it was "that which flies
        fastest to the brain." </p>
      <p>Sharazad also told "The Tale of the Two Hashish-Eaters" on the
        798th night, about a fisherman and a judge who ate hashish
        together and subsequently tried to urinate on the Sultan and his
        wazir, who were walking about the city in disguise: </p>
      <p>"Next morning, that the jest might be complete, the Sultan
        called the kadi and his guest before him. 'O discrete pillar of
        our law,' he said, 'I have called you to me because I wish to
        learn the most convenient manner of pissing. Should one squat
        and carefully lift the robe, as religion prescribes? Should one
        stand up, as is the unclean habit of unbelievers? Or should one
        undress completely and piss against one's friends, as is the
        custom of two hashish-eaters of my acquaintance?' </p>
      <p>"Knowing that the Sultan used to walk about the city in
        disguise, the kadi realized in a flash the identity of his last
        night's visitors, and fell on his knees, crying, 'My Lord, my
        lord, the hashish spake in these indelicacies, not I!' But the
        fisherman, who by his careful daily taking othe drug was always
        under its effect, called somewhat sharply: 'And what of it? You
        are in your palace this morning, we were in our palace last
        night.' 'O sweetest noise in all our kingdom,' answered the
        delighted king, 'as we are both Sultans of this city, I think
        you had better henceforth stay with me in my palace. If you can
        tell stories, I trust that you will at once sweeten our hearing
        with a chosen one.' 'I will do so gladly, as soon as you have
        pardoned my wazir,' replied the fisherman; so the Sultan bade
        the kadi rise and sent him back forgiven to his duties..." (45,
        46) </p>
      <p>Much of the bad reputation endured by Cannabis sativa in the
        past several centuries has been due in part to an unfortunate
        similarity between the terms <i>hashishin</i> ("Hashish-eater)
        and <i>assassin</i>, an uncertain word which may be derived
        from the Arabic <i>hassa</i> ("to kill"). The confusion (in
        European minds) was generated primarily by the 13th century
        Venetian explorer Marco Polo. When passing through northern
        Persia in 1271, he heard the tale of Hasan-al-Sabah and his cult
        of fidais ("faithful"). Marco Polo told the story to a scribe
        and other enthralled visitors while he was imprisoned in Genoa:
      </p>
      <p>"Concerning the Old Man of the Mountain ... The Old Man was
        called in their language Aloadin. He had caused a certain valley
        between two mountains to be enclosed, and had turned it into a
        garden, the largest and most beautiful that ever was seen,
        filled with every variety of fruit. In it were... palaces of the
        most elegant that can be imagined, all covered with gilding and
        exquisite painting. And there were runnels too, flowing freely
        with wine and honey and water; and numbers of ladies and of the
        most beautiful damsels in the world, who could play on all
        manner of instruments, and sung most sweetly, and danced in a
        manners that was charming to behold. For the Old Man desired to
        make his people believe that this was actually Paradise... And
        sure enough the Saracens of those parts believed that it was
        Paradise! </p>
      <p>"Now no man was allowed to enter the Garden save those whom he
        intended to make his Ashishin... He kept at his court a number
        of youths of the country, from 12 to 20 years of age, such as
        had a taste for soldiering, and to these he used to tell tales
        about Paradise... Then he would introduce them into his garden,
        some four, or six, or ten at&nbsp; time, having first made them
        drink a certain potion which cast them into a deep sleep, and
        then causing them to be lifted and carried in. So when they
        awoke, they found themselves in the garden... </p>
      <p>"When therefore they awoke... they deemed that it was paradise
        in very truth. And the ladies and damsels dallied with them to
        their hearts' content, so that they had what young men would
        have; and with their own good will never would quitted this
        place. </p>
      <p>"Now this Prince whom we call the Old One... made those simple
        hill-folks believe firmly that he was a great Prophet. And when
        he wanted one of his Ashishin to send on any mission, he would
        cause that potion whereof I spoke to be given to one of the
        youths in the garden, and then had him carried into his Palace.
        So when the young man awoke, he found himself in the castle, and
        no longer in that Paradise; whereas he was not over well
        pleased. He was then conducted to the Old Man's presence... The
        Prince would then ask whence he came, and he would reply that he
        came from Paradise! and that it was exactly as Mahomet had
        described it in the Law. This gave the others who stood by, and
        who had not been admitted, the greatest desire to enter therein.
      </p>
      <p>"So when the Old Man would have any Prince slain, he would say
        to such a youth: 'Go thou and slay So and So; and when thou
        returnest my Angels shall bear thee into Paradise. And shouldst
        thou die, natheless even so will I send my Angels to carry thee
        back into Paradise." So he caused them to believe; and thus
        there was no order of his that they would not affront any peril
        to execute, for the great desire they had to get... into that
        Paradise... And in this manner the Old One got his people to
        murder any one whom he desired to get rid off." (Ref. 47) </p>
      <p>Marco Polo did not name the drug used in his verson of the
        legend, yet other writers have assumed that hashish was meant,
        or perhaps opium or a mixture of the two. The 12th century abbot
        Arnold von Lubeck also wrote of the Assassins, thus: </p>
      <p>"Hemp raises them to a state of ecstasy or falling, or
        intoxicates them. Their sorcerers draw near and exhibit to the
        sleepers, phantasms, pleasures and amusement. They then promise
        that these delights will become perpetual if the orders given
        them are executed with the daggers provided." </p>
      <p>This and other errors of transmission have assured legendary
        status and the circumstantial-guilt-by-association of hashish
        and assassins. It has no basis in historical fact. The Old Man
        was an extreme ascetic who executed his own son for having
        committed a minor frivolity. </p>
      <p><b>(5) Israel ~</b><a name="israel"></a> </p>
      <p>It was thought until recently that cannabis was not mentioned
        in the Bible. Scholars have argued about the etymology of <i>kinebosm</i>
        (or, <i>kannabosm</i>) and related words such as <i>qineh</i>,
        which means hemp. Previously the word was translated as
        sugarcane or calamus. In 1903, the British physician Dr
        Creighton was the first to determine that several references to
        cannabis can be found in the Old Testament. Sara Bentowas (Inst.
        of Anthrop. Sci., Warsaw) compiled over 100 synonyms for the
        plant, and found that in the Aramaic translation of the Old
        Testament, <i>Targum Onculos</i>, the word <i>kaneh</i> or <i>kene</i>
        (cane) is linked with <i>busma</i> ("aromatic") to mean
        cannabis. According to scholars at the Hebrew University in
        Jerusalem, it has been confirmed (as of 1980) that the editors
        of the King James Bible apparently mistranslated the word <i>kineboisin</i>
        for calamus -- a tragic error that haunts Christians, Jews, and
        their victims to this day. In 1860, M'Meens noted: </p>
      <p>"Some high Biblical commentators maintain that the gall and
        vinegar, or myrrhed wine, offered to our Savior immediately
        before his crucifixion, was in all probability a preparation of
        Indian hemp, and even speak of its earlier use." (48) </p>
      <p>The Bible makes several references to hemp, such as Ezekiel
        34:29 ("a plant of renown"), Ezekiel 27:19 ("bright iron,
        cassia, and kaneh], were in thy market"), Solomon's Song 4: 14
        ("Spikenard and saffron; kaneh and cinnamon..."), Isaiah 43: 24
        ("Thou hast brought me no kaneh with money...") etc. </p>
      <p>The Bible also gives fair warning against the modern
        prohibition in Paul 1 and Timothy (4:1): </p>
      <p>"In later times, some shall... speak lies in hypocrisy...
        commanding to abstain from that which God hath created to be
        received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the
        truth." </p>
      <p>The Babylonian <i>Talmud</i> states in <i>Abodah Zarah</i>
        that mats made of hemp fiber should be placed on top of grapes
        when pressing them for winemaking, and the mats can be used
        again if they are carefully cleaned. But if the mats are made of
        another fiber, they cannot be used again for another year. The
        book <i>Kil'ayim</i> says: </p>
      <p>"Hemp is not kil'ayim, but the sages say it is kil'ayim." (49)
      </p>
      <p>In 1993, Joe Zias and his colleagues reported their find of
        skeletal remains of a 14-year old girl from the 4th century AD
        buried in a family tomb in Beir Shemesh near Jerusalem. The
        archaeologists found the skeletal remains of a full-term fetus
        in the girl's pelvis, which was too small to allow the birth and
        caused her death by hemorrhage. Several grams of gray,
        carbonized matter was recovered and proved to be cannabis.
        Perhaps it had been administered in an attempt to stop the
        uterine bleeding, or burnt for a ritual purpose, or inhaled for
        analgesia. (50, 51) </p>
      <p><b>(6) Africa ~</b><a name="africa"></a> </p>
      <p>By the 3rd millenium BC, the true hemp plant was known in
        Egypt. The ancient Egyptian word for hemp (<i>smsm t</i>) occurs
        in the Pyramid Texts in connection with ropemaking. Pieces of
        hempen material were found in the tomb of Pharoah Akhenaten
        (Amenhopis IV) at el-Amarna, and the pollen of the mummy of
        Ramses (ca. 1200 BC) has been identified as cannabis. The Ramses
        III Papyrus (A. 26) offered an opthalmic prescription containing
        <i>smsm t</i>, and the Ebers Papyrus gave "A remedy to cool the
        uterus", an enema, and a poultice to an injured toenail, each
        containing <i>smsm t</i>. (52) </p>
      <p>Sir W. Flanders Petrie found a large mat made of palm fiber
        tied with hemp cordage at el-Amarna, and other digs have
        unearthed hempen grave clothes of the Badarian, Predynastic, Pan
        and Roman periods. </p>
      <p>The Punic people dominated the Mediterranean Sea from the 11th
        to 8th century BC and continued as a lesser power until the
        Romans destroyed them in the 3rd and 2nd centuries BC. A Punic
        warship found off the coast of Sicily yielded a large quantity
        of hemp stems that might have been used for caulking, etc. (53)
      </p>
      <p>The use of cannabis as a fiber was not so basic or widespread
        an industry in Africa as it had been in China. There is no
        archaeological evidence that the early Egyptiaans knew of the
        mental effects of <i>smsm t</i>, and they did not use the fiber
        to any significant extent. The consumption of cannabis for
        spiritual reasons or for pleasure, the consumption of cannabis
        for spiritual or hedonistic reasons eventually became a common
        practice. When the 13th century Moorish botanist Ibn al-Baytar
        passed through Egypt on a pilgrimage to Mecca and Medina, he
        observed the use of hashish by Sufis and noted in his diary, <i>Al-Mukhassas</i>:
      </p>
      <p>"People who use it habitually proved its pernicious effect...
        it enfeebles their minds by carrying them maniac affections;
        sometimes it even causes their death. I recall having seen a
        time when men of the vilest class alone dared to eat it, still
        they did not like the name hashishin applied to them." </p>
      <p>Hemp embodies the spirit of freedom, and for that it has been a
        convenient scapegoat for petty tyrants throughout history. In
        1253 the Garden of Cafour, a very popular hashish center in
        Cairo, was close by the army and all of the plants growing there
        were destroyed in a huge bonfire that was visible for miles
        around. In 1378, Soudan Sheikhoumi, the Emir of Joneima, made a
        futile effort to abolish the use of hashish by searching out and
        destroying all the hemp plants in Cairo and vicinity. The
        farmers of qinnab were hunted down and executed or imprisoned.
        The known users were rounded up and had their teeth yanked out
        with tongs by soldiers before the horrified view of the
        assembled citizens. Despite such gruesome suppression, cannabis
        continued to entice and entangle people, as the Egyptian
        historian&nbsp; Maqrizi wrote in 1393: </p>
      <p>"As a consequence, general corruption of sentiments and manners
        ensued, modesty disappeared, every base and evil passion was
        openly indulged in, and nobility of external form alone remained
        in these infatuated beings." (54) </p>
      <p>Many North African people smoke <i>kif</i>, which they carry
        in a mottoni (pouch). Each compartment contains a different
        grade of Kif that is offered to guests according to the degree
        of respect or friendship due to them. Kif is smoked in <i>chquofa</i>,
        clay pipes designed for the purpose. </p>
      <p>An ancient Arabic proverb asserts that, "A pipeful of kif
        before breakfast gives a man the strength of a hundred camels in
        the courtyard". Another proverb warns, "Kif is like fire: a
        little warms, a lot burns." (55) </p>
      <p>The earliest archaeological proof of hemp-smoking in Africa
        outside of Egypt was found in an Ethiopian site near Lake Tana,
        dated to 1320. Two ceramic pipe bowls contained traces of
        cannabis. The cultivation of dagga (hemp) spread southward, but
        the practice of smoking was forgotten along the way and not
        learned again until the Dutch arrived with their pipes in the
        17th century. Previously the Hottentots and other tribes had
        only eaten the leaves, and the pipe was a welcome addition to
        their cultures. Many new forms were developed; most common were
        "earth pipes", small holes in the ground that were filled with a
        mixture of dried dagga and smoldering dung. The smokers placed
        their mouths over the holes and inhaled. (56) </p>
      <p>Other tribes developed sophisticated techniques. The explorer
        A. T. Bryant wrote thus of the Zulus: </p>
      <p>"Every Zulu kraal had a few hemp plants growing inside its
        outer fence for smoking purposes. It was known as iNtsangu... </p>
      <p>"Oft of an afternoon one might hear the soft deep boom of the
        signal-horn wafting over the veld. This was an invitation by
        some lonely man to all and sundry to come and keep him company
        with the hubble-bubble... The hubble-bubble (iGudu) was a hollow
        cow's horn (in the better brands, that of a kudu antelope),
        finely pared and polished, and used for hemp-smoking. It was
        fitted with a reed stem (isiTukulu), inserted at an acute angle
        halfway down its side, and carrying on its tip a small bowl
        (iMbiza), the size of an egg... </p>
      <p>"We deem it hardly of sufficient importance to go further into
        the details of the less significant trades of various minor
        craftsmen -- how the maker of smoking-horns (iGudu) polished his
        cow or kudu horn, or carved his hemp-holder (iMbiza) out of a
        nicely carved and polished jade-like soapstone. The smoking horn
        having been filled with water (to just above the level of the
        stem-aperature), and the bowl with dry, rubbed-up hemp leaves
        (iNtsangu) bearing a tiny glowing ember on their top, the smoker
        (having first taken a sip of water and retained it in his mouth)
        placed the large open end of the horn to the side of his mouth
        and cheek (so as to close all ingress of air), and gave two or
        three strong draws, bringing the smoke from the hemp, through
        the water, and so into his mouth, where part of it found its way
        straight into his lungs. The consequence was a violent coughing
        and abundant secretion of saliva, which latter, mixed together
        with the water and the smoke (already filling his mouth), the
        smoker now discharged in the form of a bubbly foam through a
        small reed-like stem of the iNgwevu plant. As this foamy spittle
        passed through and out of this tube (uTshumo) on to the earthen
        hut floor, the smoker, by means of his forefinger, drew with on
        the floor various designs (kraals, mazes and the rest). While
        the one smoker was thus engaged drawing his picture, his
        companion would be having his pull at the horn. In a few minutes
        the while smoking party would be loudly coughing, each in the
        interval shouting out his own or his family's praises
        (iziBongo), and all of them enwrapt in a state of consummate
        bliss... Most Zulu men smoked hemp daily without apparent harm;
        but when indulged in to excess, especially by the young, the
        mental faculties became gradually and permanently blunted. In
        some individuals hemp-smoking caused extraordinary hilarity and
        irrepressible laughter; in others, extreme moroseness; in still
        others, dangerous and criminal incitement, and even delirium.
        Young warriors were especially addicted to hemp-smoking, and
        under the exciting stimulation of the drug, were capable of
        accomplishing the most hazardous feats. The hemp the Zulus
        smoked was home-grown in every kraal, the best quality leaves
        (soft and richly growing) being called uNota, the poorer kind,
        iQume." (57, 58) </p>
      <p>Dr. David Livingstone wrote that before going into battle,
        Sotho warriors "sat down and smoked it [matokwane or lebake] in
        order that they might make an effective onslaught." But warriors
        of the Ja-Luo tribe in Uganda were forbidden to smoke dagga.
        (59, 60) </p>
      <p>The Bergamma tribe of southwest Africa cultivated dagga for
        trade with other tribes, and they paid annual tribute to the
        Saan with dagga. In 1609 the Dominican priest Joao dos Santos
        observed that the proud people of Kafaria (near the Cape of Good
        Hope) also cultivated bangue, and customarily ate its leaves.
        The Bantus developed a dagga cult based on the belief that the
        holy plant had been brought to Earth by gods from the "Two Dog
        Star" (Sirius). (61) </p>
      <p>The Pygmy people claim that they have "smoked hemp from the
        beginning of time". Scientist Carl Sagan has expressed a similar
        opinion: </p>
      <p>"In defense of the Pygmies, perhaps I should note that a friend
        of mine who has spent time with them says that for such
        activities as the patient stalking and hunting of mammals and
        fishes they prepare themselves through marijuana intoxication,
        which helps to make the long waits, boring to anyone further
        evolved than a Komodo dragon, at least moderately tolerable.
        Ganja is, he says, their only cultivated crop. It would be wryly
        interesting if in human history the cultivation of marijuana led
        generally to the invention of agriculture, and thereby to
        civilization." (62) </p>
      <p>This certainly was the case with the Bantu Bashilange tribe,
        according to the account given by the explorer Hermann von
        Wissman (1853-1905): </p>
      <p>"One tribe with another, one village with another, always lived
        at daggers drawn... The number of scars which some ancient men
        display among ther tatooings gives evidence of this. Then... a
        hemp-smoking worship began to be established, and the narcotic
        effect of smoking masses of hemp made itself felt. The
        Ben-Riamba, 'Sons of Hemp', found more and more followers; they
        began to have intercourse with each other as they became less
        barbarous and made laws." </p>
      <p>In the 1880s, the Balouba chief Kalamba-Moukengge acquired guns
        and subjugated the neighboring tribes. He then attempted to
        unify his kingdom by ordering the ancient fetishes to be burned
        in public. In their stead he adopted the custom of the Bantu,
        who believed that the ritual smoking of riamba enabled the soul
        to reincarnate. Some of the Balubas formed a Ben-Riamba cult.
        Riamba was the holy fetish of universal magic, protection, peace
        and friendship. The people smoked from communal gourd pipes up
        to a meter in circumference, which they carried with them from
        camp to camp. The Balouba men gathered in the center of the
        village each night to smoke together in a solemn manner. The
        Balouba also used hemp as a punishment; offenders were compelled
        to smoke until they lost consciousness. Recidivism was rare.

      <p>Among the Fang tribe,<i> yama</i> (hemp) or <i>inkot alok</i>
        (dry herb) is smoked ritually after ingesting <i>eboka</i>
        (ibogaine). In Gabon, the pollen of hemp is eaten, because it is
        thought to be more potent than smoking leaf material. On the
        island of Madagascar, people smoke <i>Somorona</i>, a mixture
        of <i>rongony</i> (cannabis) and the vascular cryptogram of
        Lycopodium genus. It is said to make a person fearless and able
        to overcome fatigue. The use of <i>dagga</i> was encouraged
        among African mine workers because, "After a smoke the natives
        work hard and show very little fatigue", as C. Bourhill reported
        in 1913. </p>
      <p><b>(7) Greece ~</b><a name="greece"></a> </p>
      <p>Migrant humans carried cannabis from Asia through Greece and
        Russia into Europe, and later from Africa through Spain and
        other ports of entry on the Mediterranean Sea. Thanks to their
        love of the seed, birds also did their unwitting part to help
        hemp escape cultivation. One of the earliest and most famous
        accounts of the ancient use of hemp was written by the Geek
        Historian Herodotus (5th century BC), who described its part in
        the funeral rites of the Scythians, nomads who ranged the
        steppes from about 1300 to 600 BC. The Scythians were defeated
        -- and introduced to hemp -- by the Thracian Getae early in the
        6th century BC. The Scythian chieftains were buried in a chamber
        with a wife and servants, each in their own compartment, all in
        splendid apparel and surrounded outside by dozens of slaughtered
        horses and former guards: </p>
      <p>"When they have buried&nbsp; the dead, the relatives purify
        themsleves as follows: they anoint and wash their hands; as to
        their bodies, they set up three sticks, leaning them against one
        another, and stretch, over these, woolen mats; and, having
        barricaded off this place as best they can, they make a pit in
        the center of the sticks and the mats and into it throw red-hot
        stones. </p>
      <p>"Now, they have hemp growing in that country that is very like
        flax, except that it is thicker and taller. This plant grows
        both wild and under cultivation, and from it the Thracians make
        garments very like linen. Unless someone is very expert, he
        could not tell the garment made of linen from the hempen one.
        Someone who has never seen hemp would certainly judge the
        garment to be linen. </p>
      <p>"The Scythians take the seed of this hemp and, creeping under
        the mats, throw the seed onto the stones as they glow with heat.
        The seed so cast on the stones gives off smoke and a vapor; no
        Greek steam bath could be stronger. The Scythians in their
        delight at the bath howl loudly. This indeed serves them instead
        of a bath, as they never let water near their bodies at all..."
        (64) </p>
      <p>In 1929, tents like those described by Herodotus were
        discovered in the tomb of a tattooed man and his mummified wife,
        buried in great Kurgan burial mounds in the Pazaryk Valley
        (Altai) during the 4th century BC. Russian archaeologist S.
        Rudenko also found hempen shirts and bronze censors filled with
        rocks and charred hempseed. The practice of fumigating with hemp
        was not just a funeral rite but a regular practice of the
        Scythians. In 1965, Russian archaeologists again uncovered
        Scythian tombs dating from 500-300 BC in the Pazyryk Valley;
        they too found hempseed in metal censors. Hempseed contains very
        little of the psychoactive principle (THC). Probably the
        Scythians actually burned hemp flowers under the guidance of a
        shaman. Aeschylus (525-456 BC) reported that the Thracians
        simply threw hemp into a fire and inhaled the smoke. Another
        account states that the herbs were thrown on hot rocks and
        covered with a large hide. The men stuck their heads underneath
        to inhale the vapors. (65, 66) </p>
      <p>In 1993, Russian archaeologists found the 2000-year old grave
        of a young Scythian princess in the Siberian Umok plateau,
        containing a small pot full of cannabis among the other items in
        the chamber. </p>
      <p>Herodotus also mentioned the use of hemp by the Massagetae (the
        Thracian Getae): </p>
      <p>"[They were] reputed to be a numerous and warlike people and
        some suppose them to be of Scythian nationality... They have
        also discovered a use for another tree whose fruit has a very
        odd property: for when they have parties and sit around a fire,
        they throw some of it into the flames, and as it burns it smokes
        like incense, and the smell of it makes them drunk just as wine
        does us; and they get more and more intoxicated as more fruit is
        thrown on, until they jump up and start dancing and singing.
        That at least is how I am told these strange people live." </p>
      <p>Hesychius said the Thracian women made sheets of hemp. The
        Greek biographer and moralist Plutarch (17-46 BC) wrote that
        after eating a meal the Thracians would throw the flowers of a
        plant ("which looked like oregano") into the fire inhale inhale
        the intoxicating fumes until they fell asleep. The Greek
        geographer Strabo (63 BC-24 AD) gave an account (VII.3.3: C.
        296) of the <i>Kapnobatai</i>, ("Those who walk in smoke"), a
        shamanic cult of cannabists among the Mysian and Getae Thracian
        tribes who settled north of the Danube river circa 600 BC. (67)
      </p>
      <p>Moscion (ca. 200 BC) left record of the use of hemp ropes by
        the tyrant Hiero II, who outfitted the flagship "Syracusia" and
        others of his fleet with rope made from the superior hemp
        cultivated in Rhodanus (Rhone River valley). Other Greek city
        states obtained much of their hemp from Colchis on the Black
        Sea. </p>
      <p>Homer in <i>The Odyssey</i> (4: 219-232) mentions that Helen
        employed a mysterious drug called Nepenthe ("Against sorrow") to
        revive a party that had slipped into mourning over the lost hero
        Odysseus. It is believed that Nepenthe was cannabis resin and/or
        opium. Diodorus of Sicily (1st cty. BC) also mentions Nepenthe
        in his <i>Histories</i> (I.97.7): </p>
      <p>"And as proof of the presence of Homer in Egypt they adduce
        various pieces of evidence, and especially the healing drink
        which brings forgetfulness of all past evils, which was given by
        Helen to Telemachus in the home of Menelaus. For it is manifest
        that the poet had acquired exact knowledge of the 'nepenthic'
        drug which he says Helen brought from Egyptian Thebes, given her
        by Polydamna..." </p>
      <p>In the opinion of E. W. Lane, who edited The Thousand and One
        Nights. cannabis is nepenthe: </p>
      <p>"<i>Benj</i>, the plural of which in Coptic is <i>nibendji</i>
        is without a doubt the same plant as the nepenthe, which has so
        much perplexed the commentators of Homer. Helen evidently
        brought the nepenthe from Egypt, and benj is there still
        reported to possess all the wonderful qualities which Homer
        attributes to it. </p>
      <p>The Greek physician Pedacius Dioscorides (1st cty. AD)
        described <i>Kannabis emeros</i> (female) and <i>agria</i>
        (male) in <i>De Materia Medica</i> (3: 165): </p>
      <p><i>"Kannabis emeros</i>: Cannabis (some call it Cannabium, some
        Schoenostrophon, some Asterion, ye Romans Cannabis) is a plant
        of much use in this life for ye twistings of very strong ropes,
        it bears leaves like to the Ash, of a bad scent, long stalks,
        empty, a round seed, which being eaten of much doth quench
        geniture, but being juiced when it is green is good for the
        pains of the ears. </p>
      <p>"<i>Kannabis agria</i>, Althea cannabina: Cannabis sylvestris
        (some call it Hydrastina, ye Romans Terminalis some Cannabis)
        bears little rods like to those of Althea, but blacker and
        sharpe and smaller; but ye leaves like to ye sative but sharper
        and blacker; ye flowers reddish like to Lychnis, but ye seed and
        roote like to Althea. The root being sodden, and so laid on hath
        ye force to assuage inflammations and to dissolve Oedemata, and
        to disperse ye obdurate matter about ye joints. Ye bark also of
        this, is fitting for ye twining of ropes." </p>
      <p><b>(8) Rome &amp; Italy ~</b><a name="rome"></a> </p>
      <p>The Roman empire consumed great quantities of hemp fiber, much
        of whch was imported from the Babylonian city of Sura. The
        cities of Alabanda, Colchis, Cyzicus, Ephesus and Mylasa also
        were major centers of hemp industries. It was not a major crop
        in early Italy, but the seed was a common food. Carbonized hemp
        seeds were found in the ruins of Pompee, buried by the eruption
        of Mt Vesuvius in 79 AD. (68) </p>
      <p>Galen (ca. 130-200 AD) observed in <i>De Facultatibus
          Alimentorum</i> that the Romans ate cannabis pastries at their
        banquets "to promote hilarity". </p>
      <p>Pausanius (2nd cty. BC) apparently was the first Roman writer
        to mention hemp; he noted that it was grown in Elide. A
        surviving fragment of the satirist Lucilius (ca. 100 BC)
        mentions the plant. Lucius Columela elaborated on the topic in <i>Res




          Rustica</i> (II.vii.1; II.xii.21). Caius Plinius the Elder
        (23-79 AD) also wrote at length about hemp in his <i>Natural
          History</i> (XIX: 56; XX: 97). Several other ancient Roman and
        Greek writers also described hemp: Leo Africanus (<i>The History
          &amp; Description of Africa</i> 3: 722) concerning the Lhasis
        potation in Tunisia; Plutarch (<i>Of the Names of Mountains
          &amp; Rivers</i>); Alus Gellus (<i>Noctes Atticae</i>);
        Theophrastus (<i>Dendromalache</i>, the "herb tree"); Gasius
        Catullus (<i>Codex Veronensis</i>); Cato (<i>De Re Rustica</i>);
        Aetius, Cinegius, and Titus Livius, et cetera. </p>
      <p>In <i>An Abstract of the Most Useful Parts of a Late Treatise
          on Hemp</i> (1766) by M. Marcandier, editor Thomas Painne
        wrote: </p>
      <p>"He [Marcandier] likewise acquaints us from the most ancient
        historians of the Romans, that they consumed much Hemp in their
        land and sea service; that they had magazines of it in some of
        the principal cities of the eastern empire, great quantities of
        it being by the Emperor's orders amassed at Ravenna in Italy and
        Vienna in Gaul: the officer who superintended that matter on the
        further side of the Alps, being called the procurator of hemp
        manufactures in Gaul, and had his residence in Vienna; that
        their husbandmen used it in fixing their oxen to the yoke and
        other purposes of agriculture; that their laws and their annals
        were written on hempen cloth; that the use of it was very common
        in adorning their theatres, covering their streets and public
        places, their ampitheatres and their Arenas for the Gladiators,
        to shade those who assisted at their public shows; that the
        Romans had their table linen of hemp, and that each guest
        brought his napkin with him; whence we may infer that it was
        known&nbsp; to the ancients as a material of cloth for the
        common service of their families, as well as for the purposes of
        agriculture, shipping, etc." (70) </p>
      <p>&nbsp;The second paper mill in Europe was built in Italy in
        1276. In 1303, the Venetians established a ropewalk with which
        to outfit their ships, originally using hemp from Bologna until
        they developed high-quality industrial hemp cultivation,
        especially near Padua. </p>
      <p>In April 1591, the Turks ordered an enormous quantity of hemp
        and flax from Transylvania for the sails and rigging of an
        armada. This news struck fear in the Venetians, as it could only
        mean war. Their own hemp industry was the basis of their
        considerable sea power. The Italians called hemp <i>canappa</i>,
        "the substance of a hundred operations" because it required so
        many processes to prepare the fibers for use. The effort was
        well worthwhile, however: a pound of hemp could be spun into
        nearly 250 miles of fine yet strong lace thread. </p>
      <p>The Venetians eventually came to dominate the Italian hemp
        industry and they instituted a craft union and the Tana, a
        state-operated spinning factory with very high production
        standards. Their statutes required that all Venetian ships be
        rigged only with the best quality of hemp rope. Thus Venice
        built a superior fleet that controlled Mediterranean shipping
        until the city was conquered by Napoleon in 1797. The Venetian
        Senate issued a declaration: </p>
      <p>"The security of our galleys and ships and similarly of our
        sailors and capital [rests on] the manufacture of cordage in our
        home of the Tana." (72, 73) </p>
      <p>The Romans helped spread hemp through Europe, but it was well
        known to early Europeans long before then. The German
        archaeologist Herman Busse found an urn containing sand and an
        assortment of plant fragments, including hemp seeds and
        pericarps, when he excavated a tomb from the 5th cty. BC at
        Wilmersdorf (Brandenburg) in 1896. (74) </p>
      <p>The Vikings relied on hemp for rope, sailcloth, caulking,
        fishline and nets for their daring voyages. Thus the Viking
        possibly introduced cannabis to the east coast of North America.
        Hempseed was found in the remains of Viking ships built about
        850 AD. Equally ancient retting pits have been discovered in
        Denmark. </p>
      <p>In 1753 the Swedish botanist Carl von Linn (Linnaeus,
        1707-1778) classified hemp as Cannabis sativa in his <i>Species
          Plantarum</i>, and he described the resin as a narcotic.
        Linnaeus cultivated cannabis on his windowsill so he could study
        closely its sexuality. </p>
      <p><b>(9) France ~</b><a name="france"></a> </p>
      <p>When the crypt of the Frankish Queen Arnemunde (d. 570 AD) was
        unearthed, her body was found surrounded by a spectacular
        treasure. She was wearing a silk dress and gold jewelry but the
        body was draped with hemp cloth, showing that the humble plant
        was held in high esteem. </p>
      <p>Hemp figured in the Fire-Festivals of several European
        countries. In the French Ardennes, on the first Sunay in Lent,
        it was believed to the vital that the women be tipsy that night
        if one wanted the hemp to grow tall that season. In Swabia, the
        young men and women leaped hand-in-hand over a bonfire, yelling,
        "Grow, that the hanf may be three ells high!" It was believed
        that those who made the jump would not suffer from backache when
        they reaped their crop. Furthermore, the parents of the couple
        who jumped highest would enjoy the most abundant harvest. If a
        farmer failed to add anything to the bonfire, his crops were
        cursed in general and his hemp in particular was doomed. (75) </p>
      <p>French farmers were wont to dance at the Carnival so their <i>chanvre</i>
        would grow tall. In the Vosges Mountain region, people danced on
        the roofs of their houses on Twelfth Day for the same reason.
        When sowing hempseed, farmers would pull up their pants as far
        as possible in the belief that the crop would grow precisely to
        the height of their britches. Other men jumped as high as they
        could in the field, believing that this activity made the hemp
        grow taller. In the Bean Festival of Lorraine, farmers predicted
        the height of the upcoming crop by comparing the King and Queen.
        If the King was taller than the Queen, then the male hemp would
        grow taller than the male, and vice versa. </p>
      <p>Francois Rabelais (1483-1553?), the brilliant French priest,
        scholar, lawyer and doctor, also authored <i>Gargantua and
          Pantagruel</i>, the first great novel in French literature. He
        devoted three chapters to a botanical description of
        "Pantagruelion" (his nom-de-plume for hemp) and gave a most
        eloquent account of its many virtues: </p>
      <p>"Pantagruelion also gets its name from its peculiar
        characteristics. For just as Pantagruel has been the ideal and
        symbol of all joyous perfection (I don't think any of you other
        drinkers doubts that for a moment), in Pantgruelion, too, I see
        such enormous potential, such energy, so many perfections, so
        many admirable accomplishments, that it its powers had been
        understood, back in the days when the trees (as Samual tells us)
        were choosing who would be king of the woods and rule the whole
        forest, surely Pantagruelion would have had most of the votes. </p>
      <p>"Without Pantagruelion, our kitchens would be unspeakable, even
        if they were covered with all sorts of exquisite delicacies --
        and our beds would offer no delight, even though they might be
        liberally adorned with gold, silver, platinum, ivory and
        porphyry. Without Pantagruelion, millers could not carry wheat
        to their mills, or bring back flour. Without Pantagruelion, how
        would lawyers over manage to bring their briefs to court? How,
        without it, would you ever carry plaster into workshops? Or draw
        water from wells? Without Pantgruelion, what would legal scribes
        do all day, and copyists, and secretaries, and other scribblers?
        Their documents would be destroyed, and landlord's leases too.
        And the noble art of printing would surely perish. What would we
        us to make window coverings? How would we ring our church bells?
        The priests of Isis are adorned with Pantagruelion, as are the
        statue-bearing priests around the world, and all human beings
        when they first come into this world. All the wool-bearing trees
        of India, the cotton vines of Tylos, in the Persian Sea, like
        the cotton plants of Arabia, and the cotton vines of Malta do
        not adorn as many people as this one herb. It covers armies
        against rain and cold, and certainly does it more comfortably
        than, once, skins and hides used to do. It covers theaters and
        auditoria against heat; it's tied to trees and bushes to make
        life easier for hunters; it drops down into water, fresh and
        salt alike, to help fishermen. It shapes and makes possible
        boots, and half-boots, and sea boots, spats, and laced boots,
        and shoes, and dancing shoes, slippers, and hob boots.
        Pantagruelion strings bows, pulls crossbows tight, and makes
        slings. And just as if it were a sacred herb, like verbena,
        worshipped by the souls of the dead, corpses are never buried
        without it... </p>
      <p>"By the use of this herb, which captures and holds the waves of
        the air, great ships are sent hither and thither, at the will of
        those who command them -- cargo ships, and those that carry
        passengers, huge galleons, vessels carrying whole armies. </p>
      <p>"Thanks to this herb, nations which nature seemed to keep
        hidden away, obscure, impenetrable, unknown, have now come to
        us, and we to them -- something even the birds could not do, no
        matter how light their feathers or what powers of flight they
        are given. Ceylon now has seen Lapland; Java has seen the
        Scythian mountains; the Arabs will see Theleme; Icelanders and
        Greenlanders will see the Euphrates. Pantagruelion has allowed
        the north wind to visit the home of the south wind, and the east
        wind to visit the realm of the west wind. And all of this has
        terrified the heavenly intelligences, the gods of sea and land,
        seeing that with the help of this blessed herb the Arctic
        peoples -- with the Antarticans watching -- have leaped over the
        Atlantic Ocean, swept past both tropics, vaulted down under the
        torrid zone, and measured the whole zodiac, frisking along under
        the equinoxes, with both the poles dancing on their horizon. So
        the frightened Olympic gods cried: </p>
      <p>Using this mighty herb of His, Pantagruel has given us
        something new and tedious to deal with -- worse even than those
        giants who tried to climb Olympus. Soon he'll be married; his
        wife will bear him children... They will sit at table with us,
        and take our goddesses as their wives&nbsp; -- the only way they
        can become gods... </p>
      <p>"Arabs -- Indians -- Sabians --no more <br>
        Loud praise for myrrh, incense, ebony. <br>
        Come see what better things there are <br>
        In this herb of ours, and take its seeds, <br>
        And if you grow this handsome gift <br>
        In your lands, too, give thanks to God <br>
        And royal France, whose happy sod <br>
        Provided you so handsome a gift." (76) </p>
      <p>The Arabs actually were far afield ahead of the French insofar
        as cannabis was concerned. The Moslems founded Europe's first
        paper factory in 1150, utilizing hemp cultivated around the city
        of Xativa (Alicante province, Spain). More Moorish hemp mills
        were established in Toleda and Valencia. The other countries of
        Europe soon followed suit, producing hempen rag paper in the
        same manner as the Chinese a millenium earlier. </p>
      <p>The spinning of hemp cloth was an essential industry in France
        during the 16th and 17th centuries. The spinners kept lumps of
        sugar in their mouths to stimulate salivation, with which they
        moistened the fiber as it was spun. </p>
      <p>Thomas Platter noted this of the French at Uzes in 1597: </p>
      <p>"Each family spins its own wool at home, and then takes it to
        be woven and dyed for various uses. They use spinning wheels as
        we do... but distaffs are never seen, for it is only the poorest
        people who spin hemp. The cloth may be brought from merchants
        and is sold at a lower price than that sold by hand." (77) </p>
      <p>When Napoleon invaded Egypt in 1798, thousands of his bored
        soldiers immediately took to the use of hashish, due to the
        unavailability of alcohol in the Moslem world. Hashish had
        previously been but a foreign word known only to a few well-read
        Europeans. Suddenly it became a real experience that threatened
        military discipline. In October of 1800, Napoleon issued this
        order: </p>
      <p>"It is forbidden in all of Egypt to use certain Moslem
        beverages made with hashish or likewise to inhale the smoke from
        the seeds of hashish. Habitual drinker and smokers of this plant
        lose their reason and are victims of violent delirium which is
        the lot of those who give themselves full to excesses of all
        sorts." </p>
      <p>The French expedition was accompanied by 175 scholars, among
        them Desgenettes, Rouyer, and the eminent Silvestre de Sacy.
        They enjoyed hashish so much as to send a quantity of it to
        France for their colleagues to study. The first scientific
        report on solvent extracts of hashish was published in 1803 by
        Dr. Virey. When de Sacy addressed the Institute of France in
        1809, he announced that the word Assassin was derived from
        Hashish. This pronouncement officially established the legendary
        guilt by etymology of cannabis and political murder, which has
        been discredited since then. </p>
      <p>Humble hemp was instrumental in the downfall of Emperor
        Napoleon. In 1812, Bonaparte invaded Russia with the intent to
        destroy her hemp crops, in order to punish Tsar Alexander I for
        his violation of the Treaty of Tilset (1807). Russia had
        continued to sell hemp to England through American traders. Many
        such Americans were strongly "impressed" by the Royal Navy to
        serve as a flag of convenience for&nbsp; British interests.
        Russia's winter, however, utterly defeated the French army, and
        hemp has continued to flourish there. (78) </p>
      <p>Louis Aubert-Roche became familiar with hashish while he was
        stationed in Cairo (1834-1838) and elsewhere during his
        extensive travels in the Orient. In his book <i>De la Peste ou
          Typhus d'Orient</i>... (1840), he reported that hashish was an
        effective treatment against typhus and plague. </p>
      <p>Dr Jacques-Joseph Moreau de Tours was in Egypt at the same
        time, and later published his observations in <i>Hashish and
          Mental Illness</i>. Dr Moreau also supplied hashish as a pale
        green&nbsp; paste to the members of the Parisian Club des
        Hashishins, which included such famous writers as Charles
        Baudelaire, Victor Hugo, Charles Dumas, Honore de Balzac, and
        other artists. Theophile Gautier visited the gatherings on
        occasion, but usually he ate hashish privately at the house of
        his friend Louis Menard. The writers later extolled the wonders
        of hashish in various accounts of their experimental sessions,
        conduted in the baroque Hotel Pimodan amidst lavish settings
        with a banquet room and an orchestra. (79, 80) </p>
      <p>Theophile Gautier (1811-1872) reported some salient features of
        a hashish fantasia in <i>La Presse</i> (10 July 1843): </p>
      <p>"For many years, Orientals whose religion forbids the use of
        wine, have sought to satisfy by the use of various preparations
        their need for mental excitement common to all people, and that
        people of Western countries gratify by means of spirits and
        liquors. The aspiration toward an ideal is so strong in man that
        he tries to release the bonds that keep his soul within his
        body. Since ecstasy is not within the reach of all, he drinks
        his merriment, he smokes his oblivion, and eats his madness in
        the form of wine, tobacco and hashish... What a strange problem.
        a little red liquor, a puff of smoke, a spoonful of a greenish
        paste, and the soul, that intangible essence, is changed in an
        instant. Serious men do a thousand absurd things: words pour
        freely from the mouths of the taciturn: Heraclitus laughs
        heartily, and Democritus weeps. </p>
      <p>"After a few minutes a general sluggishness overcame me. It
        seemed that my body was dissolving and becoming transparent. I
        could clearly see in my chest the hashish I had eaten, in the
        form of an emerald glowing with a million sparkles... </p>
      <p>"I had never been so overwhelmed with bliss; I dissolved into
        nothingness; I was freed from my ego, that odious and
        ever-present witness; for the first time I conceived the
        existence of elemental spirits  angels and souls separate from
        bodies... </p>
      <p>"What is different about hashish intoxication is that it is not
        continuous; it takes you and it leaves you; you rise to heaven
        and you fall back to earth without transition. As with insanity,
        there are lucid moments... </p>
      <p>"Thanks to the hashish I was able to sketch an authentic
        goblin. Up to now I had only heard them moaning and moving at
        night in my cupboard. </p>
      <p>"But enough madness. To recall a complete hashish hallucination
        would require a large volume, and a mere author cannot take the
        liberty of rewriting the Book of Revelations." </p>
      <p>Alexandre Dumas (1802-1870) wrote about hashish in The Count of
        Monte Cristo. When Franz was entertained at a banquet in the
        underground palace of Sinbad the Sailor, hashish was served for
        desert. </p>
      <p><b>(10) Britain ~</b><a name="britain"></a> </p>
      <p>The Romans introduced cannabis to the British Isles. Pieces of
        hemp rope were found in the well of a Roman fort on the Antonine
        wall at Bar Hill in Dunbartonshire. The site was occupied from
        140-180 AD, but analysis of the residues of cannabis pollen show
        that the plant was not cultivated and retted in Britain until
        about 400 AD. Then hemp and flax were grown at Old Buckenhan
        Mere. (81) </p>
      <p>The Saxons who occupied Britain about 600 AD also cultivated
        hemp and incorporated it into their medical literature. <i>The
          Commonplace Book</i> (LXIII c., folio 147a) gives a "Rite for
        Salve, Partly Irish" that contains hemp. (82) </p>
      <p>Young women would sow hempseed over nine ridges of a ploughed
        field on Halloween night while repeating, "I sow haenep seed,
        and he who is to be my husband, let him come and harrow it." A
        similar practice was observed on Valentine's Eve in Derbyshire;
        a maiden would go to a church at midnight and run around it
        twelve times nonstop while repeating her announcement: </p>
      <p>"I sow hempseed, hempseed I sow; <br>
        He that loves me best, <br>
        Come after me and mow." </p>
      <p>The superstition also was practiced on the Summer Solstice, and
        was memorialized in an old British love poem: </p>
      <p>"An eve last Midsummer no sleep I sought, <br>
        But to the field a bag of hemp-seed brought; <br>
        Scattered round the seed on every side, <br>
        And three time, in trembling accent, cried <br>
        This hemp-seed with my virgin hand I sow, <br>
        Who shall my true love be, the crop shall mow." (83) </p>
      <p>Pope Innocent VIII, however, was not convinced of hemp's
        innocence. In 1484 he issued a fiat condemning the use of hemp
        in witchcraft. The 16th century demonologist Jean Wier warned
        that hemp caused one to lose one's speech, to laugh without
        control, and to have magnificent visions. Demonologist Giovanni
        De Ninault (17th cty) named hemp flowers and seed oil as a
        principal ingredient in Satanic unguents. </p>
      <p>Hemp also was a principal ingredient in the disposition of
        witches, as itemized in an invoice from Kirkcaldy (Scotland) in
        1636: </p>
      <p>"For tows [hemp hangman' rope]&nbsp;&nbsp; 6 shillings <br>
        For hurden [hemp fabric] to be jumps for them 3 pounds, 10
        shillings <br>
        For making them&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8 shillings..." [&amp;c]
      </p>
      <p>Peasants continued to believe in the magical powers of hemp,
        and practised their superstitions as ever. On St. John's Eve,
        farmers would pick the flowers from some of their hemp plants
        and feed it to their livestock, believing that it would protect
        them from evil and sickness. And indeed it did just that, for
        cannabis hemp is endowed with great medicinal and magical
        potency! Hemp was a popular folk remedy for toothaches, to
        facilitate childbirth, to reduce convulsions, fevers,
        inflammations, and swollen joints and to cure rheumatism and
        jaundice. Cannabis was found worthy of honorable mention as a
        healing plant in several medieval herbals, such as those by
        William Turner, Mattiolo, and Dioscobas Tabermontanus. (84, 85)
      </p>
      <p>The British were utterly dependent on hemp to maintain their
        sea power and to preserve themselves from the French and
        Spanish. A early as 1533, King Henry VIII required all farmers
        to cultivate one-quarter acre of hemp or flax for every sixty
        acres of land under tillage. Queen Elizabeth repeated the order
        in 1563, but it was repealed in 1593. Farmers were reluctant to
        grow the crop because arable soil is at a premium in England,
        and hemp and flax were not thought to be profitable even with
        the incentive of bounties granted by the Crown. John Houghton
        commented on the situation it in 1682: </p>
      <p>"How all this will please those whose land is not fit for it,
        or who think they can put it to a better use, I won't say; but
        most men love to do what they will with their own, and as yet it
        is not done." (86) </p>
      <p>British farmers were not enthusiastic about hemp because they
        did not know much about the subtleties of its cultivation, and
        it did not pay well. They could not be confident of success with
        the crop, and most could not afford to experiment. Nor did they
        appreciate the labor and foul smell of retting hemp, as was
        expressed in <i>Five Hundred Points of Good Husbandrie</i>
        (1580): </p>
      <p>"Now pluck up they hempe, and go beat out the seed, <br>
        And afterward water it as ye see need. <br>
        But not in the river where cattle should drink, <br>
        For poisoning them and the people with stinke." (87) </p>
      <p>In its <i>Answer to the Georgical Enquiries</i> (1664)
        concerning the cultivation of hemp, the Royal Society did not
        have much more information to offer: </p>
      <p>"We sow much hemp upon land made very fat, beginning to plow it
        about Candlemas and twice afterwards, choosing the largest,
        sound, and brightest seed." (88) </p>
      <p>John Worlidge contributed a bit more information in hisSystema
        Agriulturae (1675): </p>
      <p>"Hemp seed is much commended for the feeding of poultry and
        other fowl, so that where plenty thereof may be had, and a good
        return for fowl, the use thereof must needs be advantageous..."
        (88) </p>
      <p>Others were not so certain: </p>
      <p>"Hemp seed, as they say, giving an ill flavor to the flesh of
        the bird that feeds on it: but this is only upon report; if it
        prove otherwise, it would be one great encouragement to the
        planting or sowing of hemp, that the seed should be of so great
        use..." (88) </p>
      <p>The Articles drafted by the Council of the North ordered the
        appointment of overseers who were to examine every household for
        their skills, and "to provide hemp, flax, or wool or some other
        thing for their wives, children and family to work upon..." </p>
      <p>In order to provide relief to the poor, the Act of 1576
        authorized the collection of stocks of hemp, wool, iron, etc,
        with which to employ people, but the law was unworkable. Roger
        North pointed this out in <i>A Discourse of the Poor</i>: </p>
      <p>"Who, by these laws, are supplied with work? What country
        parishes have raised stocks of hemp, flax, etc, and kept them
        going as the law requires, whereby the poor may have a constant
        employment?" </p>
      <p>John Norton offered his opinion in a pamphlet, <i>How to Use
          All Land Profitably</i> (1607): </p>
      <p>"Many crofts, tofts, pightles, pingles and other small quillets
        of land, about farm houses and tenements, are suffered to lie
        together idle, some overgrown with... unprofitable weeds...
        where, if the farmer would use the means, would grow sundry
        commodities, as hemp, and mustard seed, both which are so strong
        enemies to all other superfluous, and unprofitable weeds, as
        they will not suffer any of them to grow, where they are sown.
        The hemp is of great use in a farmer's house...not only for
        cordage for shipping, but also for linen, and other
        necessities..." (88) </p>
      <p>In 1611, King James I issued the <i>Book of Rates</i>,
        intended "to and forbear all such merchandise inwards... as
        serve for the setting the people of our kingdom on work (as
        cotton, raw silk and rough hemp)". He also issued Instructions
        to the Commission on Trade and requested them to study hemp: </p>
      <p>"And&nbsp; because we understand that a great mass of treasure
        is yearly spent upon linen cloth, brought from beyond the seas
        at dear rates, and for that it is conceived, if the fishing so
        much desired by us be thoroughly undertaken, and our shipping
        increased, it will require much greater proportion of hemp... We
        commend unto your considerations the best ways how the sowing of
        hemp and flax may be encouraged and undertaken within this
        kingdom, whereby so much good would rebound to us and our
        people?" (88) </p>
      <p>The failure of the Eastland merchant venture prompted James I
        to exhort the Commission in this long sentence: </p>
      <p>"Further, whereas our Eastland Merchants in former tymes did
        lade their Shipps with Hempe and Flax rough dressed in great
        Quantities, which did not onlie helpe them&nbsp; much in their
        Retornes, but did also set great Numbers of our People on work
        with dressing the same, and converting the same into Lynnen
        Cloth, which kind of Trade we understand is of late almost given
        over, by bringing in of Hempe and Flax ready dressed, and that
        for the most part by Strangers, we commend unto your care, by
        what meanes this hurtfull Error in Trade may be reformed, to the
        Help of our Merchants and the Reliefe of our poor Subjects."
        (89) </p>
      <p>In his comments <i>On the Decay of Rents</i> (1670), Sir
        William Coventry gave some wise advice that holds true today: </p>
      <p>"For the changing he use of our land two things occur to me
        most reasonable and most desirable. The one to encourage the
        planting of wood and severely to punish... the destruction of
        it... The other is to encourage the sowing of hemp..." (88) </p>
      <p>In his observations <i>On the Decay of Trade</i> (1674), Sir
        Richard Haines also pleaded with good reason for increased
        cultivation of hemp: </p>
      <p>"Too true it is that we are very poor... and therefore I humbly
        apprehend the best means to prevent this growing evil, must be:
        First, it will improve the lands which are proper for hemp...
        Second, great numbers of poor families... might hereby most
        profitably be set to work constantly... Besides, a farther
        advantage by this planting of hemp, etc, will accrue towards
        making of sails, cables, and other cordage necessary for
        shipping, of which sufficient may be made at home, without being
        beholden to our neighbors for a commodity so important for
        navigation, parting with our money to strangers for it, as we
        usually do to a very great yearly value." (88) </p>
      <p>In 1651, the desperate London hempdressers complained bitterly
        to Charles I about competition from the Dutch: </p>
      <p>"The humble petition of the poor hemp dressers in the city of
        London... most humbly showeth that the dressing of hemp hath
        been used in this kingdom time out of mind... </p>
      <p>"Now so it is within these five or six years last past the
        Netherlanders and some others have imported into this kingdom
        hemp ready dressed and tow, such as is converted into cloth,
        which daily increaseth their trading and decreaseth ours. And
        for a lamentable precedent, as they have already dealt with the
        flaxdressers which are by their means utterly decayed and
        brought to beggary... </p>
      <p>"In pitiful consideration thereof... your humble petitioners
        humbly desire this most honorable assembly that you will be
        pleased that the importation of dressed hemp, tow, and twine may
        be prohibited, restrained, and forbidden by such wholesome laws,
        cautions, and provisions as to your grave and judcious censures
        shall be thought most meet and convenient, whereunto they humbly
        submit themselves and their suit. And daily pray for your long
        healths and everlasting happiness." (88) </p>
      <p>Only a decade later, there were not enough hempdressers
        available, so the Crown passed An Act for Encouraging the
        Manufactures of Making Linen Cloth and Tapestry in 1663. The
        British invited alien workers "to set up and exercise the trade,
        occupation or mystery of breaking, hickling, or dressing of hemp
        or flax", enticing them with full citizenship within three
        years. In 1696, Ireland was permitted to export hemp yarn and
        cloth duty-free to England. (88) </p>
      <p>Britain entertained hopes that her colonies would be able to
        supply hemp to increase her naval stores, and encouraged the
        cultivation with bounties, but all such efforts were in vain.
        Philip Miller complained about this in <i>The Gardener's
          Dictionary</i>: </p>
      <p>"Of late Years the Inhabitants of the British Colonies in North
        America have cultivated this useful Plant, and a Bounty was
        granted by Parliament for the Hemp which was imported from
        thence; but whether the inhabitants of those colonies grew tired
        of cultivating it, or the bounty was not regularly paid, I
        cannot say; but whatever has been the Cause, the Quantity
        imported has by no means answered the Expectation of the Public,
        which is greatly to be lamented; because as this Commodity is so
        essential to the Marine, which should be the principle Object of
        this Kingdom, the being furnished with it from our own
        Plantations will not only save the ready Money paid for it, but
        secure for the country an ample Supply at all times, without
        being obliged to our Neighbors for it." (90) </p>
      <p>In Holland, dozens of windmills provided power to crush the
        stalks of hennep. This enormous saving of manual labor enabled
        the Dutch to produce more canefas (canvas) and rope which they
        used to develop into a powerful seafaring mercantile nation. The
        Dutch also used advanced techniques of bleaching hemp that
        required six months of retting, washing, heating and watering,
        until the introduction of sulfuric acid in 1756 reduced the time
        to three months. (91) </p>
      <p>Few other countries produced enough hemp to meet their own
        needs, so they traded with the Scandinavian and Baltic
        countries, and especially with Russia and Italy for their
        provisions of the strategic material. For that reason, in 1545
        the Spanish planted hemp in Quillota Valley in Chile for the
        local military forces and to outfit the ships that sailed into
        Santiago. Other attempts were made to introduce hemp into Peru
        and Columbia, but they were unsuccessful. One of the
        conquistador Cortes' men, Pedro Cuadrado, established a very
        successful hemp plantation in Mexico, but the governor curtailed
        their operation in 1550 because the natives had quickly
        discovered the mental effects of hemp flowers. In 1564, King
        Phillip ordered that cannabis be cultivated throughout the
        Spanish empire to ensure the supply of cloth, rope and canvas.
