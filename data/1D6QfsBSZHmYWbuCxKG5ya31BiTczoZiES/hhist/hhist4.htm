          (1)&nbsp; Anslinger vs Jazz</b><a name="jazz"></a> </p>
      <p>Immediately after the passage of the Marihuana Tax Act of 1937,
        Federal Bureau of Narcotics Commissioner Harry Anslinger made
        certain that cannabis became unavailable to physicians and
        pharmacists. He even convinced Dr Ernest Cook, chairman of the
        Committee on Revision of the United States Pharmacopoeia, to
        delete Cannabis from the official USP &amp; National Formulary
        in 1941. </p>
      <p>Anslinger implemented a four-part policy to enforce the
        Marihuana Tax Act. First, he worked to control the legitimate
        cultivation, and to eradicate the growth of wild hemp. Second,
        he managed to pacify the press and the public by de-emphasizing
        the sensational aspects of marijuana. Third, he sought to
        educate the federal judiciary, and urged them to apply the law
        strictly. </p>
      <p>Fourth, Anslinger allocated federal enforcement resources to
        fight major traffickers rather than petty users, with the
        exception of his relentless, obsessive crusade against jazz
        musicians who smoked "Mezrole". Marijuana often was so-called
        after Milton "Mezz" Mezzrow, a white musician who called himself
        a "voluntary Negro". Mezzrow moved from Chicago to Harlem in
        1929 and began selling high grade marijuana cigarettes on the
        streets. In his autobiography, Really the Blues, he said,
        "Overnight I was the most popular man in Harlem." (1) </p>
      <p>From 1943 to 1948, Anslinger maintained constant surveillance
        and extensive files of many musicians, singers, actors, and
        comedians, including such greats as Louis Armstron, Count Basie,
        Milton Berle, Les Brown, Cab Calloway, Jimmy Dorsey, Duke
        Ellington, Dizzy Gillespie, Jackie Gleason, Bennie Goodman,
        Lionel Hampton, Andre Kostelanetz, Kate Smith, and the NBC
        Orchestra. The great jazz drummer Gene Krupa kept time in San
        Quentin prison for possession of marijuana and involving a
        minor. Harry Anslinger actually planned to orchestrate a grand
        nationwide roundup of all his suspects, but his superior in the
        Treasury Department, Assistant Secretary Foley, cancelled it
        with a memo: </p>
      <p>"Mr Foley disapproves." </p>
      <p>Dr James Munch, who was a close friend of Harry Anslinger,
        later explained the commissioner's fear of jazz in an interview
        with Larry Sloman, author of Reefer madness (1979): </p>
      <p>Sloman: "Why did he want to go after them so much?" </p>
      <p>Munch: "Because the chief effect as far as they [Anslinger and
        the FBN] were concerned was that it lengthened the sense of
        time, and therefore they could get more grace beats into their
        music than they could it they simply followed the written
        copy..." </p>
      <p>Sloman: "What's wrong with that?" </p>
      <p>Munch: "In other words, if you are a musician, you are going to
        play a thing the way it is written on a sheet. But, if you're
        using marijuana, you are going to work in about twice as much
        music in between the first note and the second note. That's what
        made jazz musicians. The idea that they could jazz things up,
        liven them up, you see." </p>
      <p>Sloman: "Oh, I see.." (2) </p>
      <p>Jazz master Louis Armstrong was busted for possession of
        marijuana in 1931. He received a 6-month suspended sentence
        after spending 10 days in jail. Recalling his early days in New
        Orleans, Armstrong once said: </p>
      <p>"One reason we appreciated pot was the warmth it always brought
        forth… Mary Warner, honey, you sure was good and I enjoyed you
        heap much. But the price got a little too high to pay, law wise.
        At first you was a misdemeanor. But as the years rolled by you
        lost your 'misde' and got meaner and meaner." </p>
      <p>The love of hemp has inspired hundreds of popular songs,
        beginning with the early jazz era and continuing to date. </p>
      <p><b>(2)&nbsp; Hemp for Victory!</b><a name="vicitory"></a> </p>
      <p>Harry Anslinger was appointed in 1941 to a top-secret committee
        assigned to discover a "truth serum" for the Office of Strategic
        Services (OSS). His first drug of choice was pure cannabis
        resin! Its use was discontinued after 15 months because it
        proved to be unreliable. The subjects usually would laugh or get
        paranoid, and get hungry. Furthermore, the OSS agents began to
        use the drug themselves, rather than waste it on suspected
        spies. (3) </p>
      <p>During World War Two, hemp enjoyed a brief comeback as a vital
        crop after the Japanese invasion of the Philippines cut of
        America's supply of abaca. The Nazi invasion of Europe
        eliminated that source of hemp also. The Federal government
        therefore sponsored a crash program to produce enough hemp fiber
        to meet America's needs. The general public was informed about
        the situation in <i>Newsweek</i> magazine (16 October 1942): </p>
      <p>"Hemp: -- Part of the cargo on the Mayflower was hemp seed.
        And, being the raw material for making rope and burlap, it was
        an important crop in this country all during the sailing ship
        era. But about the turn of the century it was replaced by
        imports of Manila hemp, sisal, and jute from Africa and the
        Orient. </p>
      <p>"Long-range planners now are looking to the future even though
        present stockpiles will last until about 1944. Already the
        government has contracted for almost all the Haitian output of
        sisal, and that little republic is increasing its production.
        Last week the War Production Board approved plans for planting
        in the United States 300,000 acres of hemp (the only one of the
        fibers which will grow in this climate) and for building 71
        processing mills. Plantings will be concentrated in Kentucky,
        Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Iowa, with the
        processing plants in approximately the same areas. </p>
      <p>"This program should assure an adequate supply by the time
        stocks run out, for hemp is normally only a four month crop.
        Farmers like it, too, because it helps control weeds, needs no
        tending until harvest, and leaves the soil in good condition."
        (4) </p>
      <p>Farmers received the booklet Hemp: A War Crop (1942), which
        brought them up to date: </p>
      <p>"In normal times rope and twine made from manila fibers (abaca)
        imported from the Philippines constituted a large portion of our
        supply... Hemp imported from Italy, Russia, France and Holland,
        together with a small amount grown in Wisconsin and Kentucky,
        was used for medium grade wrapping twine and rope. Because we do
        not have climatic conditions conducive to the growing of Manila
        or jute, it is necessary to increase greatly the production of
        hemp. Thousands of acres in the Midwest will be planted and new
        factories built to handle the crop. Hemp growing in the U.S.,
        which the Bureau of Narcotics in the past has tried to stop in
        order to prevent marihuana addiction, is now apparently going to
        be allowed and even encouraged as a result of the war. This is
        seen from a War Productions Board order prohibiting the use of
        domestically produced hemp seed for any purpose except the
        growing of hemp fiber or the growing of additional hemp seed."
        (5) </p>
      <p>Thanks to the perseverance of hemp activist and author Jack
        Herer and friends, the unique USDA film <i>Hemp for Victory</i>
        (1942) was rescued from oblivion and represented on video in
        modern times. The inspiring instructional film was shown to
        groups of farmers across the land. The narrator apprised the
        audiences of their heritage and the near future: </p>
      <p>"Long ago when these ancient Grecian temples were new, hemp was
        already old in the service of mankind. For thousands of years,
        even then, this plant had been grown for cordage and cloth in
        China and elsewhere in the east. For centuries prior to 1850 all
        the ships that sailed the western seas were rigged with hempen
        ropes and sails. For the sailor, no less than the hangman, hemp
        was indispensable. </p>
      <p>"A 44-gun frigate like our cherished Old Ironsides took over 60
        tons of hemp for rigging, including an anchor cable 25 inches in
        circumference. The Conestoga wagons and prairie schooners of
        pioneer days were covered with hemp canvas. Indeed the very word
        canvas comes from the Arabic word for hemp. In those days hemp
        was an important crop in Kentucky and Missouri. Then came
        cheaper imported fibers for cordage, like jute, sisal and Manila
        hemp, and the culture of hemp in America declined. </p>
      <p>"But now with Philippine and East Indian sources of hemp in the
        hands of the Japanese, and shipment from India curtailed,
        American hemp must meet the needs of out Army and Navy as well
        as of our industry. In 1942, patriotic farmers at the
        government's request planted 36,000 acres of seed hemp, an
        increase of several thousand percent. The goal for 1943 is
        50,000 acres of hemp seed. </p>
      <p>"In Kentucky much of the seed hemp acreage is on river bottom
        land such as this. Some of these fields are inaccessible except
        by boat. Thus plans are afoot for a great expansion of a hemp
        industry as a part of the war program. This film is designed to
        tell farmers how to handle this ancient crop now little known
        outside of Kentucky and Wisconsin. </p>
      <p>"This is hemp seed. Be careful how you use it, for to grow hemp
        legally you must have a federal registration and tax stamp. Ask
        your county agent about it. Don't forget!" </p>
      <p>Hempseed was supplied to some 20,000 contracted farmers with
        further instructions from the federally financed War Hemp
        Industries, Inc. Forty-two processing mills were built and
        equipped at a cost of $360,000 each by the defense Plant
        Corporation. The narrator of <i>Hemp for Victory!</i> waxed
        eloquent in closing the film: </p>
      <p>"Spinning American hemp into rope yarn or twine in the old
        Kentucky River mill at Frankfort, Kentucky, another pioneer
        plant that has been making cordage for more than a century. All
        such plants will presently be turning out products spun from
        American-grown hemp: twine of various kinds for tying and
        upholsterers' work; rope for marine rigging and towing, for hay
        forks, derricks, and heavy duty tackle, light duty firehose,
        thread for shoes of millions of American soldiers, and parachute
        webbing for our paratroopers. As for the United States Navy,
        every battleship requires 34,000 feet of rope. Here in the
        Boston Navy Yard, where cables for frigates were made long ago,
        crews are now working night and day making cordage for the
        fleet. In the old days rope yarn was spun by hand. The rope yarn
        feeds through holes in an iron plate. This is Manila hemp from
        the navy's rapidly dwindling reserves. When it is gone, American
        hemp will go on duty again. Hemp for mooring ships, hemp for tow
        lines, hemp for tackle and gear, hemp for countless naval uses
        both on ship and shore, just as in the days when Old Ironsides
        sailed the seas victorious in her hempen shrouds and hempen
        sails. Hemp for Victory!" (6) </p>
      <p>Jack Herer and other hemp advocates have claimed that when
        pilot Captain George Bush (and future President) bailed from a
        burning plane in World War Two, the lines of his parachute were
        made of hemp, as was stated by the narrator ("parachute webbing
        for our paratroopers") in Hemp for Victory! In the otherwise
        however expert opinion of Carle Schneide, curator of flight
        material at the Smithsonian Institute: </p>
      <p>"Whoever's saying that is all wet. World War Two parachutes
        were made of cotton, silk and nylon. Hemp is too coarse --
        although the Navy did use to make ropes." </p>
      <p>Jack Herer exposed the hypocrisy of the "Smithsonian's
        Suppression of Facts About Cannabis Hemp" in a sidebar of <i>The




          Emperor Wears No Clothes</i>: </p>
      <p>"It should be noted that, even though 50-80% of all their
        displayed fibers for papers and cloth from their 'Life in
        America: 1780s to the 1800s' exhibit and 'American Maritime
        Exhibit, 1492-1850' were made of hemp, the Smithsonian Institute
        has removed all mention of cannabis hemp as it was used in paper
        and textiles, referring to it only as 'other fibers' while
        cotton, wool, flax, sisal, jute, and Manila hemp, etc, are
        specifically named. </p>
      <p>"Museum curator Arkadero's response when questioned on this
        topic was that, "Children don't need to know about hemp anymore,
        it confuses them," and the director of the Smithsonian said that
        even though hemp was the primary fiber, "We are not a fiber
        museum." (7) </p>
      <p>In 1943, the Commodity Credit Corporation contracted for
        168,000 acres of hemp straw, and paid $30-50/ton In January
        1944, however, the corporation scaled down abruptly to only
        60,000 acres. Nor was any hempseed contracted for. The CCC had
        garnered some 500,000 bushels of hempseed in 1943, and the War
        Production Board was confident that Italy could provide
        America's needs. The surplus hempseed was fed to canaries, who
        sang its praises. The farmers were left holding the bags. <i>Business




          Week</i> published this report (22 January 1944): </p>
      <p>"The WPB is cool to domestic [hemp] now that imports have
        improved, but CCC and DPC have $35,000,000 at stake -- Both
        corporations, however, would have more at stake were it not for
        a partial failure of the 1942 crop of hempseed in Kentucky...
        Twenty thousand farmers signed, but later their dreams of
        $200-an-acre hemp (four tons to the acre at $50 a ton) faded
        when storms flattened part of the crop." (8) </p>
      <p>Howard D. Salins, the Managing Director of the Flax and Fiber
        Institute of America, issued a statement (30 march 1943)
        condemning the program: </p>
      <p>"This is an Example of Cradle to Grave Planning to the End
        Result: ¾ The New Deal Bureaucrats and their fellow "dollar a
        year" fiber racketeers of the War Production Board are
        manipulating the proposition of a promotion and scheme to grow
        and produce hemp from a plant, outlawed by law, that is the
        fount of the insidious [sic] drug known as marijuana, the worst
        and most serious of all (dope) narcotic evils afflicting
        schoolchildren, in the schools and outside, and grown-ups alike
        in all walks of life. He fiber itself from this plant is
        worthless. The seeds from this plant fly far and wide. The
        resultant wild growth becomes dangerously uncontrollable. In the
        face of shortage and scarcity of labor, foodstuffs, linseed oil,
        fibers and other critical materials which are peculiarly being
        denied us, the corruptors [sic] of American life are now engaged
        in the promoting of 350,000 acres, erecting 100 buildings and
        building a large volume of equipment and machinery in a number
        of Mid-western States for the production of this narcotic (dope)
        plant product, all of which must reach the staggering cost of
        $500,000,000 and end in catastrophic failure. A number of
        land-grant educational institutions are in on this racket. The
        Commodity Credit Corporation and the War Production Board and
        the Defense Plant Corporation, through their own created
        so-called "War Hemp Industries, Inc., Agency", something new in
        the New Deal bureaucratic set-up, are running this (dope)
        narcotic show with private racketeers as undercover men. Large
        profits have been made already by them on the seeds by cheating
        and gipping [sic] the government. The financial "kill" is
        figured to be colossal for all the participants. The kill to
        agriculture, industry (the choicest and most fertile land being
        demanded) and health and welfare of the American people is going
        to reach disastrous proportions from which recovery may never be
        found possible! The power-pressure of the participants in this
        narcotic (dope) racket is obviously superior to the best
        interests of the American people even during these dangerous
        times of their sacrifices and sufferings at home and on the
        battlefront. The truth of the above report is vouched for. Do
        you want this (dope) narcotic in your community? You are lined
        up for it! </p>
      <p>Note: -- This whole hemp marijuana racket will be dumped out of
        existence right after the war is over in accordance with a
        statement from Washington DC, but obviously not before the
        "kill" in taxpayers' money has been made and the narcotic has
        been spread to dope them." (9) </p>
      <p><b>(3)&nbsp; Marijuana &amp; Heroin &amp; More Laws ~</b><a
          name="laws"></a> </p>
      <p>After World War Two the reigns of law tightened were drawn in
        on hemp. Congress passed the Boggs Act in November 1951,
        increasing the penalties for all narcotics violations including
        marijuana, to provide uniform penalties for the marihuana Tax
        Act and the narcotics Drug Import and Export Act. The federal
        penalties were increased again under the Narcotic Control Act of
        1956. Representative Clement (NY) introduced a bill in 1951
        proposing the death penalty for any violators of the narcotics
        laws. Congressman Hall (NY) wanted a minimum sentence of 100
        years. The Boggs Act wa produced in reaction to the perceived
        increase in drug use following WW2, especially among young men.
        Marijuana was accused of causing heroin addiction, and heroin
        was said to be part of a Chinese Communist plot to destroy
        America. </p>
      <p>In his book <i>The Murderers</i>, Harry Anslinger admitted
        that for many years he secretly supplied Senator Joseph McCarthy
        with morphine in order to keep the addicted senator out o the
        clutches of Commie marijuana-cum-heroin dope dealers. (10) </p>
      <p>Dr. Harris Isbell, who was director of research at the
        Lexington (KY) Public Health Service Hospital, informed the
        Kefauver Committee about the current scientific knowledge of
        cannabis when he testified: </p>
      <p>"Marihuana smokers generally are mildly intoxicated, giggle,
        laugh, bother no one, and have a good time. They do not stagger
        or fall, and ordinarily will not attempt to harm anyone. </p>
      <p>"It has not been proved that smoking marihuana leads to crimes
        of violence or to crimes of a sexual nature. Smoking marihuana
        has no unpleasant side effects, no dependence is developed on
        the drug, and the practice can easily be stopped at any time. In
        fact, it is probably easier to stop smoking marihuana cigarets
        than tobacco cigarets. </p>
      <p>"In predisposed individuals, marihuana may precipitate
        temporary psychosis and is therefore not an innocuous practice
        with them." (11) </p>
      <p>Mr Boggs was confused and addressed Commissioner Anslinger: </p>
      <p>I have forgotten the figure Dr Isbell gave, but my recollection
        is that only a small percentage of these marihuana cases was
        anything more than a temporary degree of elation." </p>
      <p>Anslinger replied: </p>
      <p>"The danger is this: Over 50% of those young addicts started on
        marihuana smoking. They started there and graduated to heroin."
        (12) </p>
      <p>Several other expert witnesses affirmed the connection between
        marihuana and heroin, and Mr Boggs himself finally understood
        the new myth well enough to summarize it in a statement during
        the debate on the House floor: </p>
      <p>"Our younger people usually start on the road which leads to
        drug addiction by smoking marihuana. They then graduate into
        narcotic drugs -- cocaine, morphine and heroin. When these
        younger persons become addicted to drugs, heroin for example,
        which costs from $8 to $15 per day, they very often must embark
        on careers of crime in order to buy the supply they needs." (13)
      </p>
      <p>Only a few dissenting voices could be heard, such as jurists
        whop felt that mandatory minimum sentencing deprived the courts
        of judicial discretion, which is basic to American law. During
        the House debate on the bill, Congressman Cellar contended that
        some youthful first-time offenders would suffer unduly, to which
        Congressman Jenkins replied with a patently false prophecy: </p>
      <p>"The enforcing officers will always have sympathy for the
        unfortunate consumer, especially if he is harmless. These
        enforcing officers are going to protect the high school boys and
        girls before the criminal courts until they know that they are
        collaborating with the peddlers." </p>
      <p>During the course of the Senate hearings held by the Kefauver
        Committee in 1951, fifteen of the 27 addicts who testified
        stated that marihuana was the first drug they had used as a
        stepping-stone to heroin. </p>
      <p>After the passage of the Boggs Act, James Bennett (Director of
        the U.S. Bureau of Prisons) addressed judges at a conference of
        the 5th Circuit in 1954, arguing that "The Boggs Bill was passed
        due to hysteria", and violated the constitutional principle of
        the separation of powers. Displeased by this, Commissioner
        Anslinger assigned FBN agents to follow Bennett and report on
        his public statements and associates. The 5th Judicial Court,
        however, took Bennett's advice and appointed a committee that
        unanimously recommended that the law be amended by removal of
        the provisions for mandatory minimum sentences. Congressman
        Boggs criticized the judges, saying: </p>
      <p>"I cannot imagine a more short-sighted recommendation. Anyone
        who has studied the narcotics trade and has seen the pitiful
        effect in countless homes throughout this nation from youths to
        the very old must recognize that this is one of the most vicious
        things in our country." </p>
      <p>A few years later, with the help of the FBN, the Narcotic
        Control Act of 1956 was passed through the bowels of Congress
        with little debate or public attention, and established
        increasingly high penalties for possession and sale of illicit
        drugs. During the hearings, Anslinger again spoke out against
        hemp. Senator Daniel asked: </p>
      <p>"Now, do I understand it from you that, while we are discussing
        marijuana, the real danger there is that the use of marijuana
        leads many people eventually to the use of heroin, and the drugs
        cause them complete addiction; is that true?" </p>
      <p>Anslinger answered: "That is the great problem and our great
        concern about the use of marijuana, that eventually if used over
        a long period, it does lead to heroin addiction!" </p>
      <p>Senator Daniel asked: "As I understand it from having read your
        book, a habitual user of marijuana or even a user to a small
        extent presents&nbsp; a problem to the community, and is a bad
        thing. Marijuana can cause a person to commit crimes and do many
        heinous things; is that not correct?" </p>
      <p>Anslinger replied: "That is correct. It is a dangerous drug,
        and is so regarded all over the world." </p>
      <p>During the Daniel Committee hearings for the Narcotic Control
        Act, Senator Walker asked Anslinger about marijuana and crime:
        "Is it or is it not a fact that the marijuana user has been
        responsible for many of our most sadistic, terrible crimes in
        this nation, such as sex slayings, and matters of that kind?" </p>
      <p>Anslinger responded: "There have been instances of that,
        Senator. We have some rather tragic occurrences by users of
        marijuana. It does not follow that all crimes can be traced to
        marijuana. There have been many brutal crimes traced to
        marijuana, but I would not say that it is the controlling factor
        in the commission of crimes." </p>
      <p>Senator Walker then asked: "I will grant you that it is not the
        controlling factor, but is it a fact that your investigation
        shows many of the most sadistic, terrible crimes, solved or
        unsolved, we can trace directly to the marijuana user?" </p>
      <p>Anslinger said: "You are correct in many cases, Senator
        Walker." </p>
      <p>"In other words, it builds up a false sort of feeling on the
        part of the user, and he has no inhibitions against doing
        anything; am I correct? </p>
      <p>Anslinger answered: "He is completely irresponsible." </p>
      <p>Senator Price Daniel (TX) got off a potshot at marijuana during
        the floor debate when he informed his colleagues thus:
        "Marihuana is a drug which starts most addicts in the use of
        drugs. Marihuana, in itself a dangerous drug, can lead to some
        of the worst crimes committed by those who are addicted to the
        habit. Evidently, its use leads to the heroin of habit and then
        to the final destruction of the persons addicted." </p>
      <p><b>(4)&nbsp; The 60s &amp; 70s ~</b><a name="60s"></a> </p>
      <p>The marijuana-to-heroin fable was gospel to narcocrats and
        politicians, but fortunately for humanity, social pioneers such
        as the beatniks of the 50s and hippies of the 60s renaissance
        learned for themselves that cannabis is a real pleasure, is not
        addictive, and does not lead to heroin addiction.&nbsp; They
        praised its virtues against the propaganda and suppression
        imposed by domineering autocrats. Since 1937, much of the
        general populace, wise in its folly, has feared marijuana.
        Meanwhile, many millions of youths and adults still possessed of
        some exploratory behavior rediscovered the forbidden fruit of
        cannabis. The use of marijuana quickly spread across the entire
        spectrum of society. Marijuana was no longer confined to
        marginal citizens such as racial minorities and criminals.
        Marijuana became a powerful political symbol of liberty and
        civil disobedience. Activist Jerry Rubin exemplified the concept
        in a speech he made in May 1970: </p>
      <p>"Smoking pot makes you a criminal and a revolutionary --- as
        soon as you take your first puff, you are an enemy of society."
      </p>
      <p>The juggernaut of drug laws also was used to crush dissenters.
        FBI director J. Edgar Hoover said in a 1968 memo to all field
        offices: "Since the use of marijuana and other narcotics is
        widespread among members of the New Left, you should be alert to
        opportunities to have them arrested by local authorities on drug
        charges." </p>
      <p>Thus, the black militant activist Lee Otis Johnson was
        sentenced by a Texas court to 30 years in prison for having
        given one "joint" to an undercover agent. Lee Johnson was head
        of the Houston branch of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating
        Committee (SNCC). His conviction was overturned by a Federal
        district court in 1972. (14) </p>
      <p>The United Nations adopted the Single Convention on Narcotic
        Drugs in 1961. The terms of Article 28(3) state that each member
        nation can "adopt such measures as may be necessary to prevent
        misuse of, and illicit traffic in, the leaves of 6the cannabis
        plant… The use of Cannabis (hemp) for other than medical and
        scientific purposes must be discontinued as soon as possible,
        but in any case within 25 years." </p>
      <p>The US Congress waited until 1967 to ratify the convention, and
        in 1970 passed the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and
        Control Act. That law claimed that cannabis had&nbsp; "no
        recognized medical uses" and was to be controlled as required by
        "United States obligations under international treaties." </p>
      <p>President Kennedy established an Ad Hoc Panel on Drug Abuse in
        1962. At the White House Conference on Narcotic and Drug Abuse
        that September, the panel announced: </p>
      <p>"It is the opinion of the Panel that the hazards of marihuana
        per se have been exaggerated and that long criminal sentences
        imposed on an occasional user or possessor of the drug are in
        poor social perspective. Although Marihuana has long held the
        reputation of inciting individuals to commit sexual offenses and
        other antisocial acts, the evidence is inadequate to
        substantiate this. Tolerance and physical dependence do not
        develop and withdrawal does not produce an abstinence syndrome."
        (15) </p>
      <p>In 1963, the President's Advisory Commission on Narcotics and
        Drug Abuse also distinguished clearly between cannabis and
        opiates: </p>
      <p>"An offender whose crime is sale of a marijuana reefer is
        subject to the same term of imprisonment as the peddler selling
        heroin. In most cases the marijuana reefer is less harmful than
        any opiate. For one thing, while marijuana may provoke lawless
        behavior, it does not create physical dependence. This
        Commission makes a flat distinction between the two drugs and
        believes that unlawful sale or possession of marijuana is a less
        serious offense than the unlawful sale or possession of an
        opiate." </p>
      <p>President Johnson's Commission on Law Enforcement and
        Administration of Justice also rejected the "stepping-stone" or
        "gateway" myth of marijuana-to-heroin use: </p>
      <p>"Marijuana is equated in law with the opiates, but the abuse
        characteristic of the two have almost nothing in common. The
        opiate produces physical dependence. Marijuana does not. A
        withdrawal sickness appears when the use of opiates is
        discontinued. No such symptoms are associated with marijuana.
        The desired dose of opiates tends to increase over time, but
        this is not true of marijuana. Both can lead to psychic
        dependence, but so can almost any substance that alters the
        state of consciousness. </p>
      <p>"There is evidence that a majority of the heroin users who come
        to the attention of public authorities have, in fact, had some
        prior experience with marijuana. But this does not mean that one
        leads to the other in the sense that marijuana has an intrinsic
        quality that creates a heroin liability. There are too many
        marijuana users who do not graduate to heroin, and too many
        heroin addicts with no known prior marijuana use, to support
        such a theory. Moreover there is no scientific basis for such a
        theory." </p>
      <p>Since then, the family of "soft" or "gateway" drugs has been
        expanded to include tobacco, alcohol and marijuana. </p>
      <p>The National Commission on marihuana guestimated that up to 25
        million Americans had used marihuana circa 1971. Since then, the
        numbers of users has fluctuated, and their demographics continue
        to change with society, the times, and the manipulation of
        statistics. Nearly 400,000,000 people worldwide use various
        forms of occasion or regularly. </p>
      <p>Several congressional committees conducted hearing on the issue
        of drug control during 1969 and 1970, culminating in the passage
        of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act, and
        the Controlled Substances Act in October 1970. The new measures
        integrated all controlled substances into a uniform framework of
        regulations, reduced "simple" possession of drugs to a
        misdemeanor, and established a National Commission on Marihuana
        and Drug Abuse to study marihuana in a formal, authoritative
        manner. The new statutes established a scheme of five
        "schedules" for controlled substances according to their
        potential for abuse. Substances in Schedule I have a high abuse
        potential, no accepted use in medicine, and are unsafe to use
        even with medical supervision. Schedule IV substances have low
        abuse potential, limited liability to cause dependence, are
        accepted in current medical practice, and are dispensed with
        minimal regulation. Cannabis was condemned to Schedule I, along
        with heroin, subject to the most stringent control and law
        enforcement. The Bureau of narcotics and Dangerous Drugs (BNDD)
        was created by merging the Treasury Department's FBN with the
        Department of Health, Education and Welfare's Bureau of Drug
        Abuse Control. </p>
      <p><b>(5)&nbsp; Marijuana &amp; The Military</b><a name="military"></a>
      </p>
      <p>Drug abuse was a major problem in Vietnam and remains a problem
        today since the CIA and other groups secured their interests in
        Southeast Asia's opium production. American troops in Vietnam
        smoked lots of potent marijuana to alleviate the dismal
        situation. In one study of 1,064 soldiers, only 32% said that
        they had not smoked it! In 1971, General Abrams, the US forces'
        commander, ordered officers to help combat drug trafficking and
        abuse, including marijuana. The privates sometimes reacted by
        "fragging" (fragmenting) officers with grenades, as happened to
        a marine sergeant who testified about it to a Senate
        subcommittee hearing in 1970. A private tossed a grenade under
        his bed, and he was critically injured. Professor Hardin Jones
        told another Senate subcommittee: </p>
      <p>"The officers I talked to in Vietnam were worried about
        cannabis because they suspected that this may have been a part
        of some of the terrible events such as the murdering of
        officers... All of the officers were uptight about this
        situation because they didn't know when it might be their turn.
      </p>
      <p>"The incidence wasn't so great that it would be likely to
        induce a neurosis in the officers, but it was great enough to
        worry about, and they knew that this kind of event was not
        associated with the heroin user, but rather with the cannabis
        user, and also the amphetamine user. But the amphetamine user
        also has to be a cannabis user, and the tie between the two is
        very, very great." </p>
      <p>Actually, amphetamine abusers tend to quite dislike cannabis. </p>
      <p>Even heroes smoked marijuana, as the Associated Press
        corroborated on June 22, 1971: </p>
      <p>"A Congressional Medal of Honor winner says he was 'stoned' on
        marihuana the night he fought of two waves of Vietcong soldiers
        and won America's highest military honor: </p>
      <p>"It was on April 1, 1970, when Mr [Peter] Lemon, an Army
        Specialist 4, used his rifle, machine gun and hand grenades to
        smash a large attack on his position. </p>
      <p>"He fought the enemy single-handed and dragged a wounded
        comrade to the rear before collapsing from exhaustion and three
        wounds. At a medical center, he refused treatment until more
        seriously injured men has been cared for. </p>
      <p>"It was the only time I ever went into combat stoned", Mr Lemon
        said. "You get really alert when you're stoned because you have
        to be. We were partying the night before. We weren't expecting
        any action because we were in a support group. All the guys were
        'heads'. We'd sit around smoking grass and getting stoned and
        talking about when we'd get to go home." </p>
      <p>Cannabis also poses a threat to nuclear security. In 1974, the
        US Army disqualified 33 military policemen from guard duty at
        the Misau Ammunition Depot (including nuclear weapons) in
        Germany, because the MPs allegedly had been smoking hashish
        while on guard duty. (16) </p>
      <p>Sailor Gary Anderson got caught smoking marijuana in the lower
        missile compartment aboard the nuclear submarine Thomas
        Jefferson in 1976, and he implicated 27 other crewmen. He told
        of "widespread drug abuse aboard the subs. The Navy is covering
        up a drug scandal." Anderson was introduced to drugs the day
        after he reported for duty. He said: </p>
      <p>"I was told on at least three occasions by officers ranging in
        rank from chief warrant officer to lieutenant that 'We don't
        care if you smoke. Just don't get caught.'" (17) </p>
      <p>When David Kaplan of the Center for Investigation Reporting
        (Oakland, CA) was interviewed on radio station KCBS in San
        Francisco (24 April 1981). He stated: </p>
      <p>"As a lot of people recognize, drugs are a problem in the
        military, and some of the people who had worked aboard US Navy
        submarines told us how they would go to the reactor room to
        smoke marijuana because it's the only room in the submarine with
        adequate ventilation. </p>
      <p>"So you could imagine what kind of problems this thing would
        bring. A Poseidon submarine... has enough atomic firepower
        aboard to incinerate 160 Soviet cities and these guys are
        getting stoned!" </p>
      <p>Small wonder then that in his introduction to the hearing on
        The Marihuana-Hashish Epidemic and Its Impact on United States
        Security (1975), Senator James Eastland was able to keep a
        straight face and say: </p>
      <p>"I consider the hearing which are the subject of this record to
        be among the most significant ever held by any committee of
        Congress! They may play a role in reversing a trend towards
        national disaster. Without public awareness, our country has
        become caught up in a marihuana-hashish epidemic that probably
        eclipses, in gravity, the national epidemics that have been so
        debilitating on the population of a number of Middle Eastern
        countries. (18) </p>
      <p><b>(6)&nbsp; The Shafer Commission ~</b><a name="shfer"></a> </p>
      <p>The Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970
        established a commission to study marijuana President Nixon
        rejected the idea of legalizing cannabis no matter what the
        commission might recommend, even before its report was written:
      </p>
      <p>"As you know, there is a commission that is supposed to make
        recommendations to me about this subject, and in this instance,
        however, I have such strong views that I will express them. I am
        against legalizing marihuana. Even if this commission does
        recommend that it be legalized, I will not follow that
        recommendation... I do not believe that legalizing marijuana is
        in the best interests of our young people and I do not think
        it's in the best interests of this country." </p>
      <p>A few weeks later, Nixon remonstranced on the topic of
        marijuana in relation to heroin and the need for "a massive
        program of information for the American people with regard to
        how the drug habit begins and how we eventually end up with so
        many being addicted to heroin... </p>
      <p>"In that respect, that is one of the reasons I have taken such
        a strong position with regard to the question of marihuana. I
        realize this is controversial. But I can see no social or moral
        justification whatsoever for legalizing marihuana. I think it
        would be exactly the wrong step. It would simply encourage more
        and more of our young people to start down the long, dismal road
        that leads to hard drugs and eventually to self-destruction." </p>
      <p>The National Commission on Marihuana and Drug Abuse was chaired
        by former Pennsylvania Governor Raymond Shafer. The
        commission&nbsp; recommended changes in the federal law: </p>
      <p>"Possession of marihuana for personal use would no longer be an
        offense, but marihuana possessed in public would remain
        contraband subject to summary seizure and forfeiture. </p>
      <p>"Casual distribution of small amounts of marihuana for no
        renumeration, or insignificant renumeration not involving profit
        would no longer be an offense." </p>
      <p>In his letter of transmittal of the Report on Marihuana to
        President Nixon, Shafer stated: </p>
      <p>"Whatever the facts are, we have reported them. Wherever the
        facts have logically led us, we have followed and used them in
        reaching our recommendations. We hope this Report will be a
        foundation upon which credibility can be restored and upon which
        a rational policy can be predicated. (19) </p>
      <p>Instead of heeding the sage advice of the Shafer Commission,
        President Nixon declared "war on drugs" in a message to Congress
        on June 17, 1971. He depicted drug use as a "national emergency"
        and claimed: </p>
      <p>"If we cannot destroy the drug menace in the United States,
        then it will surely destroy us. Drug traffic is public enemy
        number one domestically in the United States today and we must
        wage a total offensive. World-wide, nation-wide,
        government-wide, and if I may say so, media wide." </p>
      <p>President Ford was less strident that Nixon concerning drug
        issues. The Ford administration appointed a Domestic Council
        Task Force that released a White Paper on Drug Abuse in
        September 1975. It concluded that marihuana presents the least
        potential harm to individuals and society, and recommended that
        federal efforts against drugs should be focused instead on major
        trafficking cartels and manufacturers of heroin, barbiturates,
        and particularly amphetamines. The Domestic Council declared: </p>
      <p>"We must be realistic about what can be achieved and what the
        appropriate federal role is in the war against drugs. We should
        stop raising unrealistic expectations of total elimination of
        drug abuse from our society... Regrettably, we probably will
        always have a drug problem of some proportion. Therefore we must
        be prepared to continue our efforts indefinitely, in order to
        contain the problem at a minimal level, and in order to minimize
        the adverse social costs of drug abuse." </p>
      <p>In an address to Congress on August 2, 1977, President Carter
        became the first president to publicly endorse the
        decriminalization of marihuana: </p>
      <p>"Penalties against possession of a drug should be no more
        damaging to an individual than the use of the drug itself: and
        where they are, they should be changed. Nowhere is this more
        clear than the laws against possession of marijuana in private
        for personal use. Therefore, I support legislation amending
        federal laws to eliminate all federal criminal penalties of up
        to one ounce of marijuana." </p>
      <p>Several organizations, such as the American Bar Association,
        the American Medical Association, the American Council of
        Churches, and others also endorsed decriminalization. </p>
      <p>Such political hopes were lost in scandal when Peter Bourne,
        the director of the White House Office of Drug Abuse Policy, was
        forced to resign in 1978 after he foolishly wrote an illegal
        prescription for Quaaludes for one of his aides. When leaving
        the White House, Bourne told the press: </p>
      <p>"There is a high incidence of marijuana use... and occasional
        use of cocaine by staff members." </p>
      <p>The Strategy Council for Drug Abuse and Drug Traffic Prevention
        made this admission in 1979: </p>
      <p>"Drug abuse in the United States has evolved from an acute to a
        chronic problem. It is apparent from the magnitude of annual
        drug consumption in the United States that the use of drugs,
        including alcohol, has become an integral part of our culture."
      </p>
      <p>The National Household Survey on Drug Abuse, conducted in 1982,
        found some 24 million people who admitted that they smoked
        marijuana. </p>
      <p><b>(7)&nbsp; The War on Drugs &amp; the DEA</b><a name="dea"></a>
      </p>
      <p>After he declared war on drugs in 1971, President Nixon
        established a Special Action Office for Drug Abuse Prevention
        (SADDAP) and the Office for Drug Abuse Law Enforcement (ODALE).
        Secret wiretaps were used, and "Heroin Hotlines" were set up to
        obtain anonymous tips by telephone. Federal officers began
        making street arrests of dealers and buyers, a trespass of
        authority that angered local law enforcement agencies. Federal
        drug raiders sorely abused the "no-knock" provision (Title II)
        of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse and Prevention Act, which
        permitted officers to enter premises without a warrant or other
        notice if they believed that the drugs being sought would be
        destroyed or if someone's safety or life would be endangered by
        giving notice. The provision was repealed in 1974. BNDD and
        Customs agents confiscated nearly 500,000 pounds of marijuana in
        1972. ODALE was merged with the BNDD and the Office of National
        Narcotics Intelligence in 1973 to form the notorious Drug
        Enforcement Administration (DEA). The National Institute on Drug
        Abuse (NIDA) also was established in 1973 as a front for the
        programs of substance abuse prevention, treatment, and
        rehabilitation in the federal shell game of drug agencies. (20)
      </p>
      <p>In his book <i>Agency of Fear</i>, Edward Epstein documented
        how the Nixon administration established ODALE and ultimately
        the DEA as a super-agency and "private police force" to sidestep
        the CIA and FBI. The ODALE was financed by grants from the Law
        Enforcement Assistance Administration in blatant violation of
        the congressional mandate prohibiting the LEAA from using its
        funds for federal programs. Epstein wrote: </p>
      <p>"The DEA was the final stage of the White House timetable for
        consolidating its power over the investigative agencies of the
        government... If the Watergate burglars had not been arrested
        and connected to the White House strategists, the DEA might have
        served as the strong investigative arm for domestic surveillance
        that President Nixon had quested after. It had the authority to
        request wiretaps and no-knock warrants, and to submit targets to
        the Internal Revenue Service; and, with its counter-intelligence
        agents, it had the talent to enter residences surreptitiously,
        gather intelligence on the activities of other agencies of the
        government, and interrogate suspects. Yet, despite these
        potential powers, the efforts of the White House had been
        effectively truncated by the Watergate exposures." </p>
      <p>Though Nixon was unable to benefit from the DEA, his successors
        have profited handsomely from the monster. Two years after it
        was established, the Senate Government Operations Permanent
        Investigations Subcommittee charged high DEA officials with
        corruption, cover-ups, and mismanagement of money and personnel.
        Several hundred former employees of the Customs Service who
        transferred to the DEA requested to be returned to Customs. In
        Latin America, the DEA is widely considered to be a cover for
        covert CIA operations. The DEA certainly employs many former CIA
        agents. DEA agents south of the US border have created local
        drug vigilante groups by selecting, training, equipping and
        paying the leaders and members. The teams sometimes arrest,
        torture, and illegally deport their fellow citizens to the USA
        for prosecution. The flow of drugs into the USA has continued
        unabated despite all the militance that has been mustered
        against the problem. (21) </p>
      <p>&nbsp;The US Agency for International Development (AID)
        supplies much of the equipment used by the drug agencies of
        several foreign nations, and funds efforts to curtail coca
        cultivation by introducing alternative crops. In Peru, the AID
        money was given as low-interest loans to farmers who promised
        not to grow coca on their land. Most of the money was used by
        opportunistic farmers to increase their production of coca. </p>
      <p>The entire apparatus, with over 4,000 agents and their
        managers, is corrupt, scandal-ridden, and out of control. In one
        glaring bad example, the DEA imported a large amount of cocaine
        in 1988 and staged phony busts to get good press coverage and
        justify its other abuses with lies and half-truths. In 1984, DEA
        agents and informants smuggled 984 pounds of cocaine into Texas
        in a "reverse sting", then dumped it at a roadblock to be
        discovered by local police when the sting was called off by the
        sting targets, who had been forewarned. The same thing happened
        in September 1988 in Harris County (TX). The DEA, state
        troopers, and local police collaborated in a fraudulent media
        manipulation to present a failed sting operation as a major
        victory in the war on drugs. When the truth came out,
        journalists at a DEA press conference were told yet another lie:
      </p>
      <p>"It's a very rare technique... There are two things the DEA
        does not stage during its [phony] drug busts: it does not
        insinuate that there are no drugs and there are no violators..."
      </p>
      <p>Associate Attorney General Francis Keating pledged to
        investigate the allegations of systematic lying by the DEA.
        After a meeting with DEA press agent William Alden, Keating
        announced: </p>
      <p>"I have been assured that it is not the policy of the DEA to
        lie or mislead the media, nor is it DEA policy to misrepresent
        information to the media or the public in any fashion. I am
        satisfied that this is a wise policy which continues to be
        carefully followed." </p>
      <p>According to defense attorney Phil green of Houston, the DEA
        also gave two drug chemists the reagents necessary to synthesize
        amphetamine and Quaaludes, and built a laboratory for them. They
        watched them make and deliver the drugs, but never intercepted
        them, though the chemists were arrested at a later date. The
        chemists retired after two years. The DEA then raided the empty
        lab site and recovered one-half of a Quaalude tablet from a
        vacuum cleaner. In another instance, Corbet Mitchell III paid a
        DEA operative for instructions to manufacture amphetamine. The
        agent carefully explained the process and offered to assist him.
        Federal court records obtained through the Freedom of
        Informatoin Act in 1988 state: <br>
        &nbsp;"Mitchell purchased a large amount of precursor chemicals
        from the DEA storefront and was followed by agents, but they
        lost contact with him. The finished product appeared on college
        campuses soon after." (22) </p>
      <p><b>(8)&nbsp; Paraquat</b><a name="paraquat"></a> </p>
      <p>Beginning in 1976, the federal government spent $60 million to
        fund the Mexican government program of aerial spraying of
        marijuana fields with Agent Orange (2,4-D) herbicide for opium,
        and Paraquat (Gramoxene) for marijuana. The DEA sent hundreds of
        aircraft and advisors to assist the Federales. In September
        1976, the Carter administration terminated all funding for the
        program, but Mexico continued to buy and use its own supplies. </p>
      <p>Paraquat is a non-selective herbicide that shrivels plants,
        giving them a sickly yellow tint and leaving a thin film of the
        mutagenic toxin. It causes serious respiratory ailments such as
        fibrosis, lung lesions, intestinal disorders and convulsions,
        even in minute doses. It kills by causing irreversible kidney
        damage and respiratory failure. There is no antidote. </p>
      <p>Marijuana farmers in Mexico observed that the action of
        Paraquat depends on sunlight. Consequently, they harvested
        marijuana immediately after it was sprayed, and wrapped it in
        dark cloth for export to the USA. In March 1978, 13% of the
        marijuana samples from the southwest USA were found to be
        contaminated with Paraquat. A nationwide survey found 3.6% of
        910 samples were contaminated. Combustion testing indicated that
        about 0.2% of Paraquat on marijuana is smoked, and it was
        estimated that over 6000 marijuana smokers were at risk of
        exposure to as much as 500 milligrams of Paraquat annually.
        Researchers found no clinical cases of Paraquat poisoning during
        the studies, but no national search was made for such cases.
        (23) </p>
      <p>At the behest of President Reagan and the sanction of Congress,
        the DEA again sprayed Paraquat on marijuana in national forests
        in Georgia, Kentucky and Tennessee in 1983, despite public
        protests and a restraining order by US District Court Judge
        Charles Moye. The Environmental Policy Act prohibits the use of
        Paraquat in national forests. US Representative Elliott Levitas
        called the spraying program "a dingbat idea" and estimated that
        the spraying, which cost nearly $1 million and involved only
        about 60 plants, cost $16,666 per plant. Money was not the
        object, however; officials acknowledged that one reason for the
        spraying was to impress the government of Columbia with videos
        of American efforts to control cannabis with Paraquat, in order
        to convince them to do likewise. Georgia's Governor Joe Harris
        was not concerned about the potential health hazard: </p>
      <p>"We don't have any responsibility to those persons. They are
        doing something illegal." </p>
      <p>Dr Corey Slovis, director of emergency services at Grady
        Memorial Hospital in Atlanta, said: "The death penalty for
        smoking marijuana is too severe a penalty for anybody." </p>
      <p>When White House drug advisor Carlton Turner appeared on
        national television to justify the action, he said that if
        anyone died from Paraquat-poisoned pot, it would be deserved
        punishment! </p>
      <p>During the Paraquat panic of 1978, Carlton Turner worked for
        the University of Mississippi Marijuana Research program, which
        was chartered to synthesize THC, the psychoactive component in
        cannabis. At that time, Turner persistently tried to advertise a
        "Paraquat Tester" in High Times magazine. The magazine was not
        accepting ads for Paraquat test kits because none had been
        proven to work. High Times associate editor Dean Latimer
        entertained Turner's daily phone calls for a month, and finally
        asked for a sample. Turner delivered a useless "Rube Goldberg"
        kit. He went on to become the White House "drug czar" under
        President Reagan in 1981. In April 1985, Turner called for the
        death penalty of drug dealers in his address to a PRIDE
        conference in Atlanta. He resigned in December 1986 after being
        discredited in Newsweek and other publications for his stated
        belief: </p>
      <p>"Pot smoking may lead to homosexuality... gays who use
        marijuana are disking damage to their immune system and
        vulnerability to AIDS." </p>
      <p>Turner had visited some drug-treatment centers and learned that
        about 40% of the patients had engaged in homosexual activity.
        Turner said: "It seems to be something that follows along from
        their marijuana use… My concern is, how is the biological system
        affected by heavy marijuana use? The public needs to be thinking
        about how drugs affect people's lifestyles… No one is saying
        that marijuana will cause AIDS, but if you're in a high-risk
        category, you certainly don't want to use something that will
        impair your immunological system." </p>
      <p><i>Newsweek</i> added this note: "Meanwhile, Dr Stanley Weiss
        of the National Cancer Institute says that a preliminary study
        found no causative link between pot and AIDS." </p>
      <p>After his resignation, Turner conveniently went into business
        developing urine testing programs with Robert DuPont and Peter
        Bensinger, both former directors of NIDA. </p>
      <p>The Columbian government began spraying marijuana fields
        Roundup in July 1984. About 23,500 acres were under cultivation,
        providing about 10,000 tons for export to the USA. Columbia
        provided about 60% of the US market at the time. President
        Reagan wrote a letter of praise to Columbia's President
        Betancur: </p>
      <p>"I congratulate your government's decision to undertake a
        national aerial herbicide spraying campaign against marijuana.
        Your efforts serve as an example for all nations to follow."

      <p><b>(9)&nbsp;<a name="interdict"></a>Interdiction &amp;
          Eradication</b> </p>
      <p>The Posse Comitatus Act of 1878 prohibits the use if federal
        troops to enforce civilian laws. The act has long been
        considered an essential protection against militarism in
        America, but it has been conveniently violated since 1969. The
        Act was amended in 1982 to allow the use of US military to
        enforces drug laws. </p>
      <p>On September 21, 1969, the federal government launched its
        spectacular "Operation Intercept" in an attempt to arrest the
        flow of drugs across the Mexican-American border. It ended in
        failure only 20 days later. It was the nation's largest search
        and seizure operation by civil authorities. Before Operation
        Intercept, border inspectors spent an average of one minute
        searching each vehicle crossing the border. During the
        operation, inspectors spent about three minutes on each vehicle,
        creating endless delays. Nearly 2,000 agents and inspectors,
        many of whom were transferred from other posts, worked along the
        border during the first week of Operation Intercept. 1,979,824
        people crossed the border during the first week of Operation
        Intercept. Of these, 1,824 were strip-searched, and only 33
        people were arrested for all the effort. Distributors merely
        changed their methods of smuggling to flying, shipping, and
        other means. Commerce and tourism dropped over 50%. Absenteeism
        soared among Mexican workers and students who couldn't cross the
        border in good time. As indignation mounted, the newspapers and
        chambers of commerce protested loudly. The National
        Confederation of Chambers of Commerce called the operation "an
        absurd and exaggerated program for the meager results it has
        produced." During the year ending June 30, 1969, customs
        officials seized just over 57,000 pounds of marijuana, for an
        average of about 150 lb/day. During the 20 days of Operation
        Intercept, 3,202 lb of marijuana were seized to produce nearly
        the same average amount per day. Nonetheless, the US Department
        of Justice released a statement gloating over their small
        success in making marijuana "unavailable in Miami and almost
        unavailable at Yale, Harvard, and the University of California.
        A similar or even more tight supply condition exists at the
        University of Chicago, Rice Institute, Oklahoma University,
        Southern Methodist University and Northwest University." </p>
      <p>After Deputy Attorney General Kleindeist and Assistant
        Secretary of the Treasury Rossides proudly announced that
        marijuana was "almost unavailable" at the University of
        California in Berkeley and L.A., a study undertaken the
        psychology department at UCLA showed that to be a lie. The
        supply of cannabis had been reduced for only half of the 478
        students interviewed; the others maintained their preferred
        levels of intake. The students without marijuana shifted to
        other drugs, especially to potent Asian hashish and to alcohol.
        Many people went out looking for wild hemp in America. The <i>New





          York Times</i> (7 November 1969) reported on the resurgence of
        interest in wild "ditchweed" hemp during and after Operation
        Intercept: </p>
      <p>"The Director of the Kansas Department of Agriculture's Noxious
        Weeds Division reported that there were 52,050 acres of
        marijuana in the state in 1968 ¾ the figure is probably higher
        this year. The plant is also growing in wild profusion
        throughout Nebraska, Iowa and Illinois... </p>
      <p>"In Indiana, farmers complain of the difficulty of clearing the
        plant from the edges of the fields. According to underground
        sources, an elderly farmer in the Champaign-Urbana area, near
        the University of Illinois, has simply let a field go to
        marijuana. </p>
      <p>He sits in his farmhouse with field glasses, these sources say,
        waiting for youths to come and pick the crop. Then he calls the
        police and collects an informers fee.." </p>
      <p>When DEA administrator Peter Bensinger gave testimony before
        the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Criminal Justice in
        September 1979, he reported that in a period of only 45 days
        during an operation that year in the southeast USA, the DEA,
        Customs Service and Coast Guard had captured 900,000 pounds of
        marijuana, arrested 220 persons for smuggling, and confiscated
        33 ships, 6 planes, and 18 cars and trucks. Taxpayers paid for
        the police action. Consumer prices rose slightly in response. </p>
      <p>President Bush also declared war against drugs on September 5,
        1989. In his first major televised speech after his
        inauguration, he promised to spend billions of dollars fighting
        drugs, and to increase the use of military forces in the effort.
        He made good on his promise on December 20, 1989, when the USA
        again invaded Panama in Operation Just Cause to oust General
        Manual Noriega and his Panama Defense Forces, allegedly because
        of his tyranny, and supposedly because his drug trafficking
        threatened US security. Noriega was taken to the USA for trials,
        at a cost of over 1,000 lives and nearly $200 million. </p>
      <p>In 1990, the military participated in the secretive Operation
        Ghost Dancer. Despite local protests, the 9th Infantry Division
        was used to raid marijuana crops in Oregon, which was selected
        because "it ranks high among the marijuana-producing states in
        the U.S.", according to a White House spokesman. Senator Mark
        Hatfield (R-OR) said: </p>
      <p>"It was an appropriate and effective use of our federal
        resources. We have to embark upon an actual warfare in order to
        accomplish the objective of getting control of the drugs that
        are taking over so much of our country today and our people. In
        no way is this to violate the civil rights of any individual."
        (25) </p>
      <p>William Bennett, who was appointed by President Bush as
        director of the White House Office of national Drug Control
        Policy, blamed Oregon's liberal laws for the situation. Bennett
        said: </p>
      <p>"Oregon must pass tougher laws, build more prisons, hire more
        police, and take its war against drugs more seriously. Without
        such efforts, the drug problem is not going to get better fast
        enough." </p>
      <p>Amongst his other memorable contributions to drug education,
        Bennett also declared: </p>
      <p>"Marijuana smoking makes people stupid." </p>
      <p>During an interview on the Larry King Show in 1989, he said: "I
        have no moral problems with beheading drug dealers -- only legal
        ones." </p>
      <p>Bennett also facilitated a $2.9 million grant to dress Texas
        National Guard agents in cactus camouflage and patrol the
        border. In an address to the California Senate in June 1970,
        Bennett tried to resurrect and whip the dead horse of
        "marijuana-to-heroin" when he said: </p>
      <p>"Marijuana is how this country got into this problem in the
        first place. Under current California law the possession of less
        than one ounce of marijuana isn't published any more severely
        than a traffic ticket. It's classed as a minor infraction with
        no more than a $100 fine. I believe this is far too lenient. </p>
      <p>"When this law was passed, it was mistakenly thought it was OK
        to possess small amounts of marijuana. Yet we know that most
        people get started on drugs through the casual use of marijuana.
        Because of the potency of some marijuana sold today is almost 20
        times more powerful than the marijuana f the late 1960s, it can
        no longer be thought of as a harmless drug and Californians
        should recriminalize the possession of even small amounts of
        it." </p>
      <p>Californians were treated to the Campaign Against Marijuana
        Planting (CAMP), found by the state Bureau of Narcotics
        Enforcement and the DEA. In its first year, CAMP troops
        destroyed about 65,000 plants. By 1986, the count had risen to
        506,306 plants at a cost of nearly $10 million. President
        Reagan's Drug Policy Board cited CAMP as a prototype o its
        national "cannabis suppression" strategy. California Attorney
        General John Van de Kamp, founder of CAMP, called the program a
        "keystone" of California's anti-drug efforts and an "undeniable
        success", but an investigation conducted by The Bee (Sacramento)
        showed otherwise: </p>
      <p>"CAMP's claims that it is winning the pt wars are based in the
        assumption that fewer plants are being grown, and only a
        fraction of the crop escapes detection by the raiding teams.
        Critics say CAMP under-estimates the amount of marijuana that
        makes it onto the streets, and officials admit they have no way
        of knowing how many plants they-re missing. </p>
      <p>"CAMP's estimates of the value of marijuana are arbitrary. Each
        plant is assumed to be worth $2,000, whether it is a mature
        plant, a seedling plant, or a plant that has had its valuable
        buds harvested. </p>
      <p>"While the number of plants confiscated in Trinity, Humboldt
        and Mendocino counties has declined, officials in some counties
        outside of the Emerald Triangle and in Oregon and Idaho are
        finding more plants, and say that CAMP is just moving the
        problem. </p>
      <p>Critics say law enforcement has exaggerated the danger to the
        public from violence associated with marijuana cultivation, and
        parleyed the public's fears into support for CAMP. </p>
      <p>"A forfeiture program, in which private land used for marijuana
        planting is seized, is driving growers onto public lands at the
        same time that federal forestry officials are saying they don't
        have enough personnel to handle existing marijuana-related
        problems in the forests. </p>
      <p>"Despite a court injunction restricting CAMP's tactics in the
        field, local residents continue to complain that the helicopter
        raids disrupt their lives, frighten their children and spook
        their livestock." (26) </p>
      <p>Ed Parsons, a former Humboldt County deputy district attorney,
        said: </p>
      <p>"It's a state and federal boondoggle of the first order, an
        abuse of our elected official's fiscal responsibility. They
        spending millions up here on a substance that's is not even
        killing people like crack is in San Francisco. We are blessed
        with armed troops from out of helicopters, military fatigues and
        conditions that can only be called military operations year
        after year in our country." </p>
      <p>Several hundred formal complaints of civil liberty abuses were
        filed against CAMP in federal court, charging that agents buzzed
        homes with helicopters and planes, held innocent people at
        gunpoint, charged into gardens and yards without search
        warrants, and in one case shot a family's dog. US District Court
        Judge Robert Aquilar ruled in February 1985 that CAMP agents had
        "on numerous occasions conducted warrentless searches and
        seizures" and committed "sustained and repeated buzzings,
        hoverings and dive bombing that at best disturb and at worst
        terrorize, the hapless residents below." Local activists for the
        Citizens' Observation Group (COG) organized to follow CAMP
        agents and catch them in violation of Judge Aquilar's ruling. <br>
        &nbsp;Dozens of boobytraps are found by pot raiders throughout
        California each year. In September 1986, a DEA officer
        discovered an explosive device rigged to one of the 102 plants
        in a guerrilla garden, set to explode if the plant was cut or
        uprooted. A sign of the times was found pieced together with
        newsprint and tacked to a tree in the Tahoe National Forest in
        1988: </p>
      <p>"I'm watching you. The best way to avoid dying is to turn
        around. We're organized crime. Justice through murder. Risk
        death. No way out. No future. Booby trapped, and I give you fair
        warning." (27) </p>
      <p><i>The Bee</i> (Sacramento) interviewed a marijuana cultivator
        in Garberville who said growers hire Mexicans to perform many of
        the chores, including guard duty because "they work cheap and at
        the end of the season they're expendable." Between 1983 and 1988
        there were at least 10 marijuana-related homicides in the
        forests of California, and an average of 40 violent incidents
        each year. </p>
      <p>In October 1986, Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng and Smokey
        the Bear announced plans to create a 500-person force, trained
        by the DEA or FBI "to battle marijuana growers who have seized
        control of almost 1 million acres of national forest deemed
        unmanageable" by the Forest Service. Congress authorized about
        $20 million for the effort and made marijuana growing in
        national forests a federal felony. The USDA later claimed that,
        "heavily armed pot growers forced the agency to close 886,000
        acres of national forest lands in 1987." The San Jose (CA)
        Mercury News reported a scare story spread by officials in
        October 1986: </p>
      <p>"Max Peterson, chief of the Forest Service, told reporters that
        a forest ranger recently accompanied a women's club excursion
        group into the Klamath National Forest in Northern California to
        look for wildflowers and found a number of live grenades dancing
        at the end of a trip wire. </p>
      <p>"However, a top law enforcement officer said he was unaware of
        the incident."'I'm the chief of law enforcement for the Klamath
        National Forest, so I would know about it', he said." (28) </p>
      <p>Operation harvest provided 24-hour coverage of the
        Arizona-Mexico border by National Guard units from four states
        for 30 days in 1987, during which time they identified 93
        aircraft that fit the smuggling profile. National Guard or
        Customs aircraft attempted to intercept a third of the targets,
        but only caught six, none of which carried drugs. The operation
        cost $960,000. During an 18-day operation in may 1988, the navy
        and Coast Guard used four destroyers and frigates to stop 35
        ships out of 571 spotted by radar. They made only one seizure of
        marijuana, worth about $400,000. The operation cost $6.5
        million. <br>
        &nbsp;In May 1988, the frustrated House voted 385-20 to have the
        military seal the nation's borders and "substantially halt" the
        flow of illegal drugs into the USA -- within 45 days! The
        defense Department submitted a job estimate of $22 billion and
        said it would require 110 AWACs, 96 infantry battalions, 53
        helicopter companies, 165 cruisers and destroyers, and 17
        fighter squadrons. To begin with, the Pentagon had only 34 AWACs
        in its repetoire. Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci told Congress
        the sobering truth in June 1988 calling it "a mission the armed
        forces cannot accomplish under any foreseeable rules of
        engagement. All the eradication and interdiction efforts in the
        world will not be effective as long as the demand for drugs in
        this country is so great." (29) </p>
      <p>The Joint Task Force (JTF), federal agencies, 7th Infantry
        Division Army troops and the National Guard raided northern
        California pot farmers during Operation Green Sweep in July
        1990, because President Bush "was concerned about drug
        interdiction on public lands", according to the explanation
        offered by the Bureau of land Management. Humboldt County
        Sheriff Dave Renner publicly dissociated himself from the
        operation, calling it "ill-advised and counter-productive." (30)
      </p>
      <p>The DEA and several Hawaiian state agencies launched a showcase
        effort to eradicate marijuana in Operation Wipeout in November
        1990. The effort included spraying herbicides by helicopter.
        Marijuana became scarce, and prices rose to hundreds of dollars
        per ounce. According to a NIDA-funded survey conducted by
        Patricia Morgan (a professor of public health at UC Berkeley)
        and Karen Joe (U. Hawaii), the scarcity of cannabis caused
        "significant numbers" of people to switch from marijuana to
        "ice", an extremely dangerous form of methedrine. Morgan said: </p>
      <p>"A lot of people see ice as a substitute for marijuana here.
        This really mirrors the kind of responses we got. This is
        typical -- not atypical -- for locals." </p>
      <p>The pattern matches that established in California in the
        mid-1980s, when researchers noted an increase in cocaine use
        after CAMP was established. Donald Topping, director of the
        Social Science Research institute (U. Hawaii), said: </p>
      <p>"The government appears to have eliminated a relatively
        harmless substance and are pushing kids in the direction of a
        more harmful substance. I think the state needs to look at the
        repercussions of the success in the eradication programs. In my
        mind the evidence is so clear that the escalation in the price
        of marijuana has encouraged young people in particular to turn
        to less expensive mind-altering substances." (31) </p>
      <p>The biggest hashish bust in history occurred on July 1, 1991
        when the navy destroyer Ingersol intercepted the freighter Lucky
        Star near Midway Island in a joint effort by the US Customs
        Service, Coast Guard, and navy. Over 100 tons of Pakistani
        hashish was found. Federal officials estimated its value at $1.2
        billion. The previous record haul was 43 tons by authorities in
        San Francisco in 1986. (32) </p>
      <p>In a 1983 report, Government Accounting Office (GAO) auditors
        decried the unreliable accuracy of statistics on seizures used
        by law enforcement agencies to gauge their drug interdiction
        efforts: </p>
      <p>"No one has comprehensive information on what is seized or what
        happens to interdiction arrestees. Without such data, we
        question how agency managers can make decisions on
        interdiction." </p>
      <p>The GAO recommended that the DEA, Customs Service, and Coast
        Guard "develop a reliable information base for evaluating the
        effectiveness of interdiction program components." The GAO
        estimated that in 1981, the Customs Service overstated by 52%
        the amount of drugs it actually seized. Not until 1987 did the
        several agencies begin to assign identification numbers to the
        loads of drugs seized to ensure that the load is counted only
        once. (33) </p>
      <p>The GAO summarized 17 years of studying the drug war in a 1988
        report to Congress:,"Since our current approach is not working,
        it is time to consider devoting more emphasis aimed at reducing
        demand: prevention, treatment and research on the causes and
        extent of drug abuse." </p>
      <p>The GAO also observed that the drug war had no leader. Instead,
        a patchwork of 37 federal agencies attacked the problem without
        concert, and fought each other in bureaucratic turf wars. </p>
      <p>The GAO's comptroller general, Charles Bowsher concluded: "We
        lack a cohesive federal anti-drug policy and strategy. The time
        has come to assign the authority and responsibility for planning
        and coordinating federal anti-drug efforts to a single
        individual." </p>
      <p>President Reagan vetoed a Congressional plan to establish an
        American drug lord, but compromised by establishing a
        cabinet-level National Drug Control Policy Board. It was chaired
        by the US attorney general, the CIA director, and heads of the
        departments of Defense, State, Treasury and Health. The Board
        issued a report in January 1987, calling for a fight against
        drug supply and demand. In its report to Congress, the GAO
        described the paper as "primarily a description of existing drug
        enforcement strategies and activities" rather than a plan of
        operations. The affecting agency budgets and programs necessary
        to bring cohesion to federal drug control efforts." The
        Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 created a Director of National Drug
        Control Policy, or "drug czar", which allowed the likes of
        Carlton Turner and William Bennett, et al., to come into
        unqualified prominence as babbling heads of the federal Hydra.

      <p>The National Drug Intelligence Center (NDIC) in Johnstown PA
        opened for business in June 1993 for the purpose of
        consolidating the drug intelligence generated by 19 different
        agencies. According to a critical report issued by the GAO, the
        $50 million facility is redundant and is a pork barrel project
        placed in the hometown of Senator John Murtha. The operations
        managers are located in Washington DC because Johnstown is too
        far away from the decision-making center to be practical. The
        NDIC duplicates much of the work also done at the El Paso
        Intelligence Center, established in 1974 with DEA funds and
        operated by representatives of 13 federal agencies with
        agreements with all 50 states. (35) </p>
      <p><b>(10)&nbsp; Mandatory Minimum Sentences</b><a
          name="mandatory"></a> </p>
      <p>Congress passed a series of crime and drug bills in the 1980s,
        imposing severe mandatory minimum sentences that soon caused a
        tripling of the nation's prison capacity and population. By
        March 2000, the number of prisoners in the USA totaled
        2,000,000. The new laws also caused drastic changes in police
        work, lawyering, prosecution, prison standards, the judiciary,
        legislative intent, correctional theory, and public attitudes
        about drugs and law. In 1963, a commission established under
        Attorney General Robert kennedy and President John Kennedy had
        urged for repeal of the mandatory sentences imposed by the Boggs
        Act and others in the 1950s. Their report cited several negative
        effects that are painfully apparent today: "prison crowding,
        outrageous prosecution, lack of judicial latitude, and an
        unchecked rise in violent crimes." </p>
      <p>In 1970, Congress repealed all mandatory sentences and restored
        the function of judicial discretion. But before long, the
        recidivist Congress indulged in mass stupidity again and
        repeated its own recent history. The Anti-Crime Bill of 1982
        allowed judges to fine drug offenders up to twice their profits,
        and allowed the government to forfeit property in all felony
        drug cases. A fund was established with forfeiture proceeds to
        be used for further enforcement of drug laws. Each election year
        thereafter, the law was toughened up. The Crime Control Act of
        1984 established a presumption of no bail for defendants charged
        with major drug offenses. Forfeiture powers were increased: up
        to $100,000 of goods could be taken without full-scale court
        proceedings. </p>
      <p>The Anti-Drug Act of 1986 established fines of up to $4
        million, and mandated minimum sentences of at least 10 years for
        those convicted of major drug crimes. The government assumed
        still more power to seize and forfeit assets, including
        substitute assets if the illegally gained assets were
        inaccessible. The Anti-Drug Act of 1988 declared the absurd and
        impossible goal of a "drug-free America" and set 1995 as the
        target date for its accomplishment. The act also allowed the
        death penalty for murders committed in the course of a
        drug-related felony. The Crime Control Act of 1990 was more of
        the same. The 1990 Transportation Appropriations Bill required
        states to pass laws revoking (for 6 months) the drivers'
        licenses of persons convicted of drug offenses, or else lose
        millions of dollars in federal highway funds. On June 27, 1991,
        the US Supreme Court called drug trafficking a grave threat to
        society, and ruled that states may impose a life sentence
        without parole for defendants convicted for possession of large
        amounts of drugs. (36) </p>
      <p>One week after college basketball star Len bias died from a
        cocaine overdose in 1986, House Speaker Tip O'Neill ordered the
        House crime subcommittee to draft a tough new drug law that
        included longer mandatory minimum sentences. Eric Sterling,
        counsel to the crime subcommittee, later said: </p>
      <p>"There was political panic and haste. We wrote the mandatory
        minimum sentencing law in about three days. There was no time
        for the usual review by criminologists, judges and law
        professors. We never really thought through what we were doing.
        At their root, mandatory minimums are a legislative statement
        that judges are incompetent and can't be trusted to know a major
        drug trafficker from a minor criminal. Mandatory mimimums are
        unjust!" </p>
      <p>Judge Oscar Spicer compared the legislative atmosphere "to
        1722, when the English Parliament, during a crime epidemic,
        unanimously passed legislation making any crime punishable by
        death." Many judges criticized the laws as "unjust and harsh"
        and appealed to Congress to "reconsider the wisdom of all
        mandatory minimum sentencing statutes." Analysts have repeatedly
        shown that mandatory minimums actually help violent criminals
        because they are freed from jail early to make room for
        non-violent drug offenders. From 1950 to 1990, the average time
        served for al serious non-drug crimes fell by 65% while drug
        sentencing rose sharply. In 1970, about 16% of the federal
        prisoners were drug offenders. By 1994 the proportion rose to
        62%; by 1997 it reached 72%. The national prison population has
        nearly tripled since 1982, without achieving significant
        reduction in drug availability. The US prison population passed
        the 2,000,000 mark early in 2000. </p>
      <p>San Francisco Sheriff Michael Hennessey despaired: "Drug
        dealers and users have consumed the single most valuable
        resource in the criminal justice system: jail cells. We
        desperately need the limited space in our nation's jails and
        prisons to house violent offenders, not minor league dope
        addicts and dealers." </p>
      <p>Jonathan Turley, a professor of law at George Washington
        University's National Law Center, studied the effects of the
        drug war and claimed that it is fueling a major crisis in the
        prison system, but having little effect on the drug problem: </p>
      <p>"There is no indication at all that the drug laws are having
        any impact on the streets of America. They are having a great
        effect on the re-election of politicians. This is one big scam
        played on the American people." (37, 38) </p>
      <p>The injustice created by mandatory minimum sentencing for drug
        offenses has moved nearly a hundred senior federal judges to
        refuse to hear such cases, and many other justices have retired
        prematurely for the same reason. When judge Jack Weinstein (NY)
        announced his decision, he wrote: "I simply cannot sentence
        another impoverished person whose destruction has no discernable
        effect on the drug trade." </p>
      <p>The modern legislative form of "Reefer Madness" has caused
        tragedies far worse than any of the fantastic marijuana gore
        stories of the 1930s. In one extreme case among many, Mark Young
        merely introduced two marijuana dealers in Indianapolis who
        later did business together, were arrested, and cooperated with
        the government. They implicated Young, who subsequently received
        a life sentence without possibility of parole in February 1992.
        Speaking about his prosecutors in an interview, Young said: </p>
      <p>"Someone who'd do what they're doing is capable of anything!
        They've only proved I'm capable if smoking a joint, or of
        introducing a guy to another guy who needs some pounds. That's
        the most they've proved me capable of. What they're doing,
        they're destroying these families and passing out life
        sentences, taking people's lives, putting children on the street
        ¾ I mean horrendous acts. I don't know of anyone that would do
        anything that malicious for a salary." (39) </p>
      <p>Hundreds of similar instances of gross injustice have occurred
        since then. The case of Jim Montgomery, who smoked marijuana to
        relieve his muscle spasms, is utterly inhumane. He was convicted
        by a jury that sentenced him to life imprisonment plus 16 years.
        The judge later reduced the sentence to 10 years. He was
        released on appeal bond after nearly a year in a prison
        hospital, where he developed a life-threatening infection.
        Montgomery said: "I'll never go back to that prison. I'ld rather
        put a bullet in my head." </p>
      <p>The government also tried to forfeit Montgomery's home, which
        he shared with his widowed mother. </p>
      <p>Leland James of Oklahoma City received two life sentences, plus
        10 years, for having bought 50 pounds of marijuana from
        narcotics officers in a "reverse sting". </p>
      <p><b>(11)&nbsp; Forfeiture &amp; Informants</b><a
          name="forfeiture"></a> </p>
      <p>Law enforcement officials have long been able to punish
        convicted criminals by confiscating their property, but it was
        not until 1984 that Congress authorized forfeiture without first
        charging the individual with a crime. The drug law provisions
        that allow seizure and forfeiture of cash and assets have been a
        goldmine for lawmen, but a nightmare for thousands of victims in
        civil rights abuses, particularly of the Fifth Amendment (the
        right to due process) and the Eighth Amendment (against
        excessive punishment). Asset forfeiture and cash seizures make a
        mockery and travesty of those rights and others, and provide
        ample opportunity for corruption. The DEA has contended that 80%
        of people whose property is seized by the DEA do not contest the
        action, thus "proving" that most of the assets appropriated are
        the fruits of criminal labor Critics say that it only goes to
        show how difficult it is to recover property from the
        government. In fact, no criminal charges are filed in more than
        half of federal forfeiture cases. Rather, the primary purpose of
        the laws --&nbsp; to inflict suffering on drug dealers --
        becomes secondary to revenue collection for the agencies
        involved. California Deputy Attorney General Gary Schons
        commented: </p>
      <p>"Focusing on the revenues has distorted the whole system;
        there's no question about it. What happened is that the money
        has acted like a drug and these agencies have become addicted."
      </p>
      <p>Schons blamed the addiction on the "reluctance of city and
        county governments to give law enforcement money because they
        know police agencies have access to forfeiture funds. Basically
        they're saying you ¾ the police agencies ¾ have to go out and
        generate your own revenues." (41) </p>
      <p>One notably gross abuse occurred in New Jersey in 1991 when
        Salem County prosecutor Frank Hoerst III quit his post amidst
        charges that he stole approximately $15,000 from a law
        enforcement fund of forfeited drug money and property. Among his
        indulgences, Hoerst purchased a $5,000 car stereo system. The
        Hoerst case is but one of many such instances. Other common
        abuses involve a legal 'shakedown" where defendants buy their
        cars back from prosecutors. Civil forfeiture actions deprive
        suspects of their possessions while their trials are pending,
        robbing them of their defense funds or vehicles needed to hold
        legitimate jobs. Some defendants decline to contest civil
        forfeitures because one cannot plead the Fifth Amendment in a
        civil case, and the civil testimony could damage the criminal
        case. (42) </p>
      <p>An extreme case occurred when the motor yacht Ark Royal, valued
        at $25 million, was seized when the Coast Guard found ten
        marijuana seeds and two stems aboard the ship. Prompted by
        public criticism, the ship was returned after the owner paid

        tons of scallops) was seized by the Coast Guard in may 1988 when
        part of a marijuana cigarette and a few seeds were found in the
        crew's quarters. The felony charges against the ship's owner
        were later dropped, but the experience cost him $20,000 in legal
        fees, $80,000 in lost income, and a $250 fine. About $2 billion
        worth of cash and property is seized each year in the USA. (43,
        44) </p>
      <p>The drug laws have created a growth industry of "Confidential
        informants". For example, Sheriff Gene Taylor of Anderson County
        (SC) encouraged residents to buy illicit drugs to set up
        dealers, and he promised to pay them up to 25% of any money or
        assets seized in the arrest. The sheriff bought billboards
        advertising: "Need Money? Turn in a Dope Dealer". Anderson said:
        <br>
        "I want people to realize they can make really good money,
        depending on how much they cooperate." (45) </p>
      <p>Informing has become a mass occupation that manufactures crime
        and lies in order to sell the product. Entire cases are based on
        the substantiated assertions of informants, sometimes with
        tragic results. In one case, federal authorities made a rare
        public apology, 18 months after shooting Donald Carlson, a
        41-year old computer company executive. In August 1992, he awoke
        near midnight at the sound of violent banging on his door. The
        intruders would not identify themselves, so Carlson called the
        police. Then he fired two warning shots. The agents battered
        down the door, threw in a stun grenade, shot him, and shot him
        twice again as he lay disarmed on the floor. No drugs were
        found. Authorities said that an informant "told wild tales about
        heavily-armed South American drug traffickers using Carlson's
        home in suburban Poway as a cocaine warehouse." The informant
        was charged with lying to agents. (46) </p>
      <p>Hired informants often commit crimes to maintain their covers,
        and they can be granted immunity if caught. For example,
        according to William Moore, former US attorney for the Southern
        District of Georgia: </p>
      <p>"A couple of years ago we busted a guy for importing large
        amounts of drugs who started screaming that he was a DEA
        informant working for an agent in California. We called his
        agent, who confirmed the guy was an informant but was not
        supposed to be working on anything in Georgia. There's no doubt
        the guy was working both sides but we ended up letting him go
        because he was an informant." (47) </p>
      <p>Michael Hauptman, president of the Georgia chapter of the
        American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) stated: </p>
      <p>"I have had a police officer admit to me that she and other
        officers fabricate the existence of Confidential Informants just
        to obtain search warrants. And they get away with it. Unless the
        government agrees that the CI is presently party to the crime,
        judges almost never make the authorities reveal the CI's
        identity." </p>
      <p><b>(12)&nbsp; Drug Testing ~</b><a name="testing"></a> </p>
      <p>Between 1982 and 1988, the percentage of American companies
        that tested employees for drug use increased from 5% to nearly
        30%. In 1986, President Reagan's Commission on Organized Crime
        recommended that the president should direct all federal
        agencies to draft explicit statements of drug policy, implement
        guidelines, and establish suitable drug testing programs. State
        and local governments and business leaders were urged to adopt
        and support the official policy, that any and all use of drugs
        in the workplace is unacceptable. </p>
      <p>In September 1986, President Reagan signed Executive Order No.
        12,564 mandating a drug-free workplace along with passage of the
        Anti-Drug Abuse Act. In June 1987, he was further gratified by
        the enactment of Public Law 100-71, Section 503, Title V, which
        permits the government to test federal employees for drugs. The
        Department of Health and Human Services issued the mandatory
        Guidelines for Federal Workplace Drug Testing Programs: Final
        Guidelines in 1988 to apply to all federal agencies and to serve
        as a model for private industry. All the programs test urine for
        marijuana and cocaine, and optionally, for opiates,
        amphetamines, PCP, and other substances, but not alcohol. The
        tests are used randomly, to test for cause of accidents, or in
        pre-employment screening of job applicants. </p>
      <p>The results are fraught with technical difficulties, and the
        tests often are inaccurate, giving rise to false positive
        results that have cost many innocent persons their jobs. For
        example, the common drug Ibuprofen gives a positive response to
        the test for marijuana. Other adulterants in the urine sample,
        such as vinegar, slat or chlorine bleach, may yield false
        negative results. <br>
        &nbsp;The program has given rise to fraudulent tests, such as
        were conducted by the Pretrial Services Agency in Washington DC.
        Employees there sold defendants "clean urine" either by changing
        the paperwork involved in the drug testing, or by having the
        defendant's escort (assigned to collect the urine sample)
        provide the "clean" tinkle. In another case, an 1992 audit of
        the employee drug-testing program at the Department of the
        Interior inaccurate reporting of results, destruction of
        records, widespread mismanagement, and 450 urine samples that
        were improperly labeled or had damaged seals. They were tested
        anyway and the results were considered valid. </p>
      <p><b>(13)&nbsp; Drug Tax Stamp Acts</b><a name="stamp"></a> </p>
      <p>As if to complete and repeat the vicious cycle of America's
        drug law dilemma, beginning with the Marihuana Tax Act in 1937,
        and again with Indiana's Narcotic Tax Stamp in 1969, some 30
        states passed various forms of an Illegal Drug Tax Stamp to be
        levied against dealers. Even if acquitted of criminal charges,
        the dealers could be charged with tax evasion, and their
        property forfeited. Most of the stamp sales were made to
        philatelists. In June 1974, the US Supreme Court struck down the
        marijuana tax laws because they comprised double jeopardy.
        Justice Paul Stevens said: </p>
      <p>"Taken as a whole, this drug tax [Montana's Dangerous Drug Tax
        Act of 1987] is a concoction o anomalies, too far-removed in
        crucial respects from a standard tax assessment to escape
        characterization as a punishment for the purpose of double
        jeopardy analysis. The marijuana tax is not analogous to taxes
        on cigarettes or alcohol. The government allows the manufacture
        and sale of cigarettes because the harm is outweighed by the
        benefits, such as creating employment, satisfying consumer
        demand and providing tax revenues. </p>
      <p>"These justifications vanish when the taxed activity is
        completely forbidden, for the legitimate revenue raising purpose
        that might support such a tax could be equally well served by
        increasing the fine imposed upon conviction… [The marijuana tax
        is questionable] because it was levied on goods already
        destroyed. The state presumably destroyed the contraband goods
        in this case before the tax on them was assessed. A tax on
        possession of goods that no longer exist and that the taxpayer
        never lawfully possessed has an unmistakable punitive
        character." </p>
      <p>Dissenting Judge Rehnquist wrote: "The court's decision
        drastically alters existing law by subjecting taxes to the
        double-jeopardy clause. Moreover, it is clear from the structure
        and purpose of the act that it was passed for the legitimate
        purpose of raising revenue from the profitable underground drug
        business." (49) </p>
      <p>Would that the same standards were applied to the marijuana Tax
        Act of 1937! </p>
