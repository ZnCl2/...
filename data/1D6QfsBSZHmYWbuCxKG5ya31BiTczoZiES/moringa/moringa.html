      <b>Overview Information</b><br>
      Moringa is a plant that is native to the sub-Himalayan areas of
      India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Afghanistan. It is also grown in
      the tropics. The leaves, bark, flowers, fruit, seeds, and root are
      used to make medicine.<br>
      <br>
      Moringa is used for “tired blood” (anemia); arthritis and other
      joint pain (rheumatism); asthma; cancer; constipation; diabetes;
      diarrhea; epilepsy; stomach pain; stomach and intestinal ulcers;
      intestinal spasms; headache; heart problems; high blood pressure;
      kidney stones; fluid retention; thyroid disorders; and bacterial,
      fungal, viral, and parasitic infections.<br>
      <br>
      Moringa is also used to reduce swelling, increase sex drive (as an
      aphrodisiac), prevent pregnancy, boost the immune system, and
      increase breast milk production. Some people use it as a
      nutritional supplement or tonic.<br>
      <br>
      Moringa is sometimes applied directly to the skin as a germ-killer
      or drying agent (astringent). It is also used topically for
      treating pockets of infection (abscesses), athlete’s foot,
      dandruff, gum disease (gingivitis), snakebites, warts, and wounds.<br>
      <br>
      Oil from moringa seeds is used in foods, perfume, and hair care
      products, and as a machine lubricant.<br>
      <br>
      Moringa is an important food source in some parts of the world.
      Because it can be grown cheaply and easily, and the leaves retain
      lots of vitamins and minerals when dried, moringa is used in India
      and Africa in feeding programs to fight malnutrition. The immature
      green pods (drumsticks) are prepared similarly to green beans,
      while the seeds are removed from more mature pods and cooked like
      peas or roasted like nuts. The leaves are cooked and used like
      spinach, and they are also dried and powdered for use as a
      condiment.<br>
      <br>
      The seed cake remaining after oil extraction is used as a
      fertilizer and also to purify well water and to remove salt from
      seawater....<br>

      <b>Abstract</b><br>
      OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the protective role of leaves of Moringa
      oleifera (M. oleifera) Lam. against arsenic-induced toxicity in
      mice... RESULTS: It revealed that food supplementation of M.
      oleifera leaves abrogated the arsenic-induced elevation of
      triglyceride, glucose, urea and the activities of alkaline
      phospatase, aspartate aminotransferase and alanine
      aminotransferase in serum. M. oleifera leaves also prevented the
      arsenic-induced perturbation of serum butyryl cholinesterase
      activity, total cholesterol and high density lipoprotein
      cholesterol. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that the leaves of
      M. oleifera may be useful in reducing the effects of
      arsenic-induced toxicity.<br>

          (Sajina) seed on arsenic-induced hepatocellular degeneration
          in female albino rats.</b><br>

      <b>Abstract</b><br>
      In an attempt to develop new herbal therapy, an aqueous extract of
      the seed of Moringa oleifera was used to screen the effect on
      arsenic-induced hepatic toxicity in female rat of Wistar strain.
      Subchronic exposure to sodium arsenite (0.4 ppm/100 g body
      weight/day via drinking water for a period of 24 days)
      significantly increased activities of hepatic and lipid function
      markers such as alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase,
      cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL along with a decrease in total
      protein and HDL. A notable distortion of hepatocellular
      histoarchitecture was prominent with a concomitant increase in DNA
      fragmentation following arsenic exposure. A marked elevation of
      lipid peroxidation in hepatic tissue was also evident from the
      hepatic accumulation of malondialdehyde and conjugated dienes
      along with suppressed activities in the antioxidant enzymes such
      as superoxide dismutase and catalase. However, co-administration
      of aqueous seed extract of M. oleifera (500 mg/100 g body
      weight/day for a period of 24 days) was found to significantly
      prevent the arsenic-induced alteration of hepatic function markers
      and lipid profile. Moreover, the degeneration of histoarchitecture
      of liver found in arsenic-treated rats was protected along with
      partial but definite prevention against DNA fragmentation
      induction. Similarly, generation of reactive oxygen species and
      free radicals were found to be significantly less along with
      restored activities of antioxidant enzymes in M. oleifera
      co-administered group with comparison to arsenic alone treatment
      group. The present investigation offers strong evidence for the
      hepato-protective and antioxidative efficiencies of M. oleifera
      seed extract against oxidative stress induced by arsenic.<br>

          arsenic-induced toxicity in rats</b><br>
        <b>Richa Guptaa</b><br>

      <b>Abstract</b><br>
      Moringa oleifera Lamarack (English: Horseradish-tree,
      Drumstick-tree; Hindi: Saijan; Sanskrit: Shigru) belongs to the
      Moringaceae family, is generally known in the developing world as
      a vegetable, a medicinal plant and a source of vegetable oil.
      Besides, the plant is reported to have various biological
      activities, including hypocholesterolemic agent, regulation of
      thyroid hormone status, anti-diabetic agent, gastric ulcers,
      anti-tumor agent and hypotensive agent, used for treating various
      diseases such as inflammation, cardiovascular and liver diseases.
      Therapeutic efficacy of oral administration of seed powder of M.
      oleifera (500 mg/kg, orally, once daily) post arsenic exposure
      (100 ppm in drinking water for 4 months) was investigated in rats.
      Animals exposed to arsenic(III) showed a significant inhibition of
      δ-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD) activity, decrease in
      reduced glutathione (GSH) level and an increase in reactive oxygen
      species (ROS) in blood. On the other hand, a significant decrease
      in hepatic ALAD, and an increase in δ-aminolevulinic acid
      synthetase (ALAS) activity was noted after arsenic exposure. These
      changes were accompanied by an increase in thiobarbiturc acid
      reactive substances (TBARS) level in liver and kidney. Activities
      of liver, kidney and brain superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase
      also showed a decrease on arsenic exposure. Administration of M.
      oleifera seed powder post arsenic exposure, exhibited significant
      recovery in blood ALAD activity while, it restored blood GSH and
      ROS levels. Most of the other blood biochemical variables remained
      unchanged on M. oleifera supplementation. A significant protection
      in the altered ALAD and ALAS activities of liver and TBARS level
      in liver and kidney was however, observed after M. oleifera
      administration. Interestingly, there was a marginal but
      significant depletion of arsenic from blood, liver and kidneys.
      The results, thus lead us to conclude that post arsenic exposure
      administration with the seed powder of M. oleifera has significant
      role in protecting animals from arsenic-induced oxidative stress
      and in the depletion of arsenic concentration. Further studies
      thus can be recommended for determining the effect of
      co-administrating seed powder of M. oleifera during chelation
      therapy with a thiol chelator.<br>

        </div>
        <br>
        <div align="left"> Moringa oleifera is the most widely
          cultivated species in the genus Moringa, the only genus in the
          plant family Moringaceae. Common names include moringa,
          drumstick tree, horseradish tree, and ben oil tree or benzoil
          tree.<br>
          <b> </b></div>
      </div>
      <br>
      M. oleifera is a fast-growing, deciduous tree[5] that can reach a
      height of 10–12 m (32–40 ft) and trunk diameter of 45 cm (1.5
      ft).[6] The bark has a whitish-grey colour and is surrounded by
      thick cork. Young shoots have purplish or greenish-white, hairy
      bark. The tree has an open crown of drooping, fragile branches and
      the leaves build up a feathery foliage of tripinnate leaves.<br>
      <br>
      The flowers are fragrant and asexual, surrounded by five unequal,
      thinly veined, yellowish-white petals. The flowers are about
      1.0-1.5 cm (1/2") long and 2.0 cm (3/4") broad. They grow on
      slender, hairy stalks in spreading or drooping flower clusters
      which have a length of 10–25 cm.[6]<br>
      <br>
      Flowering begins within the first six months after planting. In
      seasonally cool regions, flowering only occurs once a year between
      April and June. In more constant seasonal temperatures and with
      constant rainfall, flowering can happen twice or even all
      year-round.[6]<br>
      <br>
      The fruit is a hanging, three-sided brown capsule of 20–45 cm size
      which holds dark brown, globular seeds with a diameter around 1
      cm. The seeds have three whitish papery wings and are dispersed by
      wind and water.[6]<br>
      <br>
      In cultivation, it is often cut back annually to 1–2 m (3–6 ft)
      and allowed to regrow so the pods and leaves remain within arm's
      reach.[6]<br>
      <br>
      <b>Cultivation</b><br>
      The moringa tree is grown mainly in semiarid, tropical, and
      subtropical areas, corresponding in the United States to USDA
      hardiness zones 9 and 10. It tolerates a wide range of soil
      conditions, but prefers a neutral to slightly acidic (pH 6.3 to
      7.0), well-drained sandy or loamy soil.[7] In waterlogged soil,
      the roots have a tendency to rot.[7] Moringa is a sun- and
      heat-loving plant, thus does not tolerate freezing or frost.
      Moringa is particularly suitable for dry regions, as it can be
      grown using rainwater without expensive irrigation techniques.<br>

      <b>Production area</b><br>
      India is the largest producer of moringa,[7] with an annual
      production of 1.1 to 1.3 million tonnes of fruits from an area of
      380 km².[citation needed] Among Indian states, Andhra Pradesh
      leads in both area and production (156.65 km²) followed by
      Karnataka (102.8 km²) and Tamil Nadu (74.08 km²).[citation needed]<br>
      <br>
      Moringa is grown in home gardens in West Bengal and Odisha and as
      living fences in southern India and Thailand, where it is commonly
      sold in local markets. In the Philippines and Indonesia, it is
      commonly grown for its leaves which are used as food. Moringa is
      also actively cultivated by the World Vegetable Center in Taiwan,
      a center for vegetable research. In Haiti, it is grown as
      windbreaks and to help reduce soil erosion.<br>
      <br>
      More generally, moringa grows in the wild or is cultivated in
      Central America and the Caribbean, northern countries of South
      America, Africa, Southeast Asia and various countries of Oceania.<br>
      <br>
      As of 2010, cultivation in Hawaii, for commercial distribution in
      the United States, is in its early stages.[7]<br>
      <br>
      <b>Soil preparations</b><br>
      In tropical cultivation, soil erosion is a major problem.
      Therefore, the soil treatment has to be as shallow as possible.
      Plowing is required only for high planting densities. In low
      planting densities, "it is better to dig pits and refill them with
      the soil. This ensures good root system penetration without
      causing too much land erosion. The pits must be 30 to 50 cm deep,
      and 20 to 40 cm wide."[citation needed]<br>
      <br>
      <b>Propagation</b><br>
      Moringa can be propagated from seed or cuttings. Direct seeding is
      possible because the germination rate of M. oleifera is high.
      Moringa seeds can be germinated year-round in well-draining soil.
      Cuttings of 1 m length and at least 4 cm diameter can be used for
      vegetative propagation.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Planting</b><br>
      For intensive leaf production, "the spacing of plants should be 15
      x 15 cm or 20 x 10 cm, with conveniently spaced alleys (for
      example: every 4 m) to facilitate plantation management and
      harvests."[8] Weeding and disease prevention are difficult because
      of the high density. In a semi-intensive production, the plants
      are spaced 50 cm to 1 m apart. This gives good results with less
      maintenance.<br>
      <br>
      Moringa trees can also be cultivated in alleys, as natural fences
      and associated with other crops. The distance between Moringa rows
      in an agroforestry cultivation is usually between 2 and 4 meters.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Breeding</b><br>
      In India, from where moringa most likely originated, the diversity
      of wild types is large. This gives a good basis for breeding
      programs. In countries where moringa has been introduced, the
      diversity is usually much smaller among the cultivar types.
      Locally well-adapted wild types, though, can be found in most
      regions.<br>
      <br>
      Because moringa is cultivated and used in different ways, there
      are different breeding aims. The breeding aims for an annual or a
      perennial plant are obviously different. The yield stability of
      fruits is an important breeding aim for the commercial cultivation
      in India, where moringa is cultivated as an annual. On less
      favorable locations, perennial cultivation has big advantages.
      Erosion is much smaller with perennial cultivation. In Pakistan,
      varieties have been tested for their nutritional composition of
      the leaves on different locations.[9] The different breeding aims
      result in a different selection. India selects for a higher number
      of pods and dwarf or semidwarf varieties. Breeders in Tanzania,
      though, are selecting for higher oil content.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Yield and harvest</b><br>
      M. oleifera can be cultivated for its leaves, pods, and/or its
      kernels for oil extraction and water purification. The yields vary
      widely, depending on season, variety, fertilization, and
      irrigation regimen. Moringa yields best under warm, dry conditions
      with some supplemental fertilizer and irrigation.[7] Harvest is
      done manually with knives, sickles, and stabs with hooks
      attached.[7] Pollarding, coppicing and lopping or pruning are
      recommended to promote branching, increase production and
      facilitate harvesting.[10]<br>
      Fruits<br>
      <br>
      When the plant is grown from cuttings, the first harvest can take
      place 6–8 months after planting. Often, the fruits are not
      produced in the first year, and the yield is generally low during
      the first few years. By year two, it produces around 300 pods, by
      year 3 around 400–500. A good tree can yield 1000 or more
      pods.[11] In India, a hectare can produce 31 tons of pods per
      year.[7] Under North Indian conditions, the fruits ripen during
      the summer. Sometimes, particularly in South India, flowers and
      fruit appear twice a year, so two harvests occur, in July to
      September and March to April.[12]<br>
      <br>
      <b>Leaves</b><br>
      Average yields of 6 tons/ha/year in fresh matter can be achieved.
      The harvest differs strongly between the rainy and dry seasons,
      with 1120 kg/ha per harvest and 690 kg/ha per harvest,
      respectively. The leaves and stems can be harvested from the young
      plants 60 days after seeding and then another seven times in the
      year. At every harvest, the plants are cut back to within 60 cm of
      the ground.[13] In some production systems, the leaves are
      harvested every 2 weeks.<br>
      <br>
      The cultivation of M. oleifera can also be done intensively with
      irrigation and fertilization with suitable varieties.[8] Trials in
      Nicaragua with 1 million plants per hectare and 9 cuttings/year
      over 4 years gave an average fresh matter production of 580 metric
      tons/ha/year, equivalent to about 174 metric tons of fresh
      leaves.[8]<br>

      One estimate for yield of oil from kernels is 250 l/ha.[7] The oil
      can be used as a food supplement, as a base for cosmetics, and for
      hair and the skin.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Pests and diseases</b><br>
      The moringa tree is not affected by any serious diseases in its
      native or introduced ranges. In India, several insect pests are
      seen, including various caterpillars such as the bark-eating
      caterpillar, the hairy caterpillar or the green leaf caterpillar.
      The budworms Noctuidae are known to cause serious defoliation.
      Damaging agents can also be aphids, stem borers, and fruit flies.
      In some regions, termites can also cause minor damage. If termites
      are numerous in soils, insects management costs are not
      bearable.[6]<br>
      <br>
      The moringa tree is a host to Leveillula taurica, a powdery mildew
      which causes damage in papaya crops in south India. Cultivation
      management should therefore be checked.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      <b>Leaves</b><br>
      Nutritional content of 100 g of fresh M. oleifera leaves (about 5
      cups) is shown in the table (right; USDA data), while other
      studies of nutrient values are available.<br>
      <br>
      The leaves are the most nutritious part of the plant, being a
      significant source of B vitamins, vitamin C, provitamin A as
      beta-carotene, vitamin K, manganese, and protein, among other
      essential nutrients.[3][15][16] When compared with common foods
      particularly high in certain nutrients per 100 g fresh weight,
      cooked moringa leaves are considerable sources of these same
      nutrients. Some of the calcium in moringa leaves is bound as
      crystals of calcium oxalate[17] though at levels 1/25th to 1/45th
      of that found in spinach, which is a negligible amount.<br>
      <br>
      The leaves are cooked and used like spinach and are commonly dried
      and crushed into a powder used in soups and sauces.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Drumsticks</b><br>
      The immature seed pods, called "drumsticks", are commonly consumed
      in South Asia. They are prepared by parboiling, and cooked in a
      curry until soft.[18] The seed pods/fruits, even when cooked by
      boiling, remain particularly high in vitamin C[19] (which may be
      degraded variably by cooking) and are also a good source of
      dietary fiber, potassium, magnesium, and manganese.[19]<br>
      <br>
      <b>Seeds</b><br>
      The seeds, sometimes removed from more mature pods and eaten like
      peas or roasted like nuts, contain high levels of vitamin C and
      moderate amounts of B vitamins and dietary minerals.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Seed oil</b><br>
      Mature seeds yield 38–40% edible oil called ben oil from its high
      concentration of behenic acid. The refined oil is clear and
      odorless, and resists rancidity. The seed cake remaining after oil
      extraction may be used as a fertilizer or as a flocculent to
      purify water.[20] Moringa seed oil also has potential for use as a
      biofuel.[21]<br>
      <br>
      <b>Roots</b><br>
      The roots are shredded and used as a condiment with sharp flavor
      qualities deriving from significant content of polyphenols.[22]<br>
      <br>
      <b>Malnutrition relief</b><br>
      Moringa trees have been used to combat malnutrition, especially
      among infants and nursing mothers.[3][23] Since moringa thrives in
      arid and semiarid environments, it may provide a versatile,
      nutritious food source throughout the year.[24] Moringa leaves
      have been proposed as an iron-rich food source (31% Daily Value
      per 100 g consumed, table) to combat iron deficiency.[25] However,
      further study is needed to test practical applications of using
      this dietary source and its iron bioavailability.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Water purification</b><br>
      Moringa seed cake, obtained as a byproduct of pressing seeds to
      obtain oil, is used to filter water using flocculation to produce
      potable water for animal or human consumption.[36][37] Moringa
      seeds contain dimeric cationic proteins[38] which absorb and
      neutralize colloidal charges in turbid water, causing the
      colloidal particles to clump together, making the suspended
      particles easier to remove as sludge by either settling or
      filtration. Moringa seed cake removes most impurities from water.
      This use is of particular interest for being nontoxic and
      sustainable compared to other materials in moringa-growing regions
      where drinking water is affected by pollutants.[37]<br>

          Overview</b><br>
        <b>Alessandro Leone, et al.</b><br>
      </div>
      <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b>Moringa oleifera is an interesting plant for its use in
      bioactive compounds. In this manuscript, we review studies
      concerning the cultivation and production of moringa along with
      genetic diversity among different accessions and populations.
      Different methods of propagation, establishment and cultivation
      are discussed. Moringa oleifera shows diversity in many characters
      and extensive morphological variability, which may provide a
      resource for its improvement. Great genetic variability is present
      in the natural and cultivated accessions, but no collection of
      cultivated and wild accessions currently exists. A germplasm bank
      encompassing the genetic variability present in Moringa is needed
      to perform breeding programmes and develop elite varieties adapted
      to local conditions. Alimentary and medicinal uses of moringa are
      reviewed, alongside the production of biodiesel. Finally, being
      that the leaves are the most used part of the plant, their
      contents in terms of bioactive compounds and their pharmacological
      properties are discussed. Many studies conducted on cell lines and
      animals seem concordant in their support for these properties.
      However, there are still too few studies on humans to recommend
      Moringa leaves as medication in the prevention or treatment of
      diseases. Therefore, further studies on humans are recommended.<br>
      <br>
      This species is a fast growing soft wood tree that can reach 12 m
      in height and is indigenous to the Himalayan foothills (northern
      India Pakistan and Nepal) [2,3]. Its multiple uses and potential
      attracted the attention of farmers and researchers in past
      historical eras. Ayurvedic traditional medicine says that Moringa
      oleifera can prevent 300 diseases and its leaves have been
      exploited both for preventive and curative purposes [4]. Moreover,
      a study in the Virudhunagar district of Tamil Nadu India reports
      Moringa among the species utilized by traditional Siddha healers
      [5]. Ancient Egyptians used Moringa oleifera oil for its cosmetic
      value and skin preparation [6]; even if the species never became
      popular among Greeks and Romans, they were aware of its medical
      properties [7]. Moringa oleifera has been grown and consumed in
      its original areas until recently (the 1990s) when a few
      researchers started to study its potential use in clarifying water
      treatments, while only later were its nutritional and medical
      properties “discovered” and the species was spread throughout
      almost all tropical countries. In 2001, the first international
      conference on Moringa oleifera was held in Tanzania and since then
      the number of congresses and studies increased disseminating the
      information about the incredible properties of Moringa oleifera.
      Now this species has been dubbed “miracle tree”, or “natural
      gift”, or “mother’s best friend”.<br>
      <br>
      Moringa oleifera grows in any tropical and subtropical country
      with peculiar environmental features, namely, dry to moist
      tropical or subtropical clime, with annual precipitation of 760 to
      2500 mm (it requires less than 800 mm irrigation) and temperature
      between 18 and 28 °C. It grows in any soil type, but heavy clay
      and waterlogged, with pH between 4.5 and 8, at an altitude up to
      2000 m [8,9].<br>
      <br>
      A study on local uses and geographical distribution of Moringa
      oleifera [10] that covers the major agro-ecological region in
      Nigeria, clearly established that “though considered a not
      indigenous species, Moringa oleifera has found wide acceptance
      among various ethnic Nigeria, who have exploited different uses
      (e.g., food, medicine, fodder etc.).<br>
      <br>
      Nowadays, Moringa oleifera and its derivatives are distributed
      mainly in Middle East, African and Asian countries [11] and are
      still spreading to other areas.<br>
      <br>
      <b>2. Cultivation and Production</b><b><br>
      </b>Moringa oleifera development is achieved in two main ways:
      sowing and cutting.<br>
      <br>
      Traditionally in Sudan the seeds are preferred while vegetative
      propagation is common in India, Indonesia and in some areas of
      West Africa [8].<br>
      <br>
      Sowing requires selection of the seeds, when they are easily
      available and human labor is limited, while the possibility to
      transplant seedlings allows flexibility in field planting even if
      it requires extra labor and costs.<br>
      <br>
      Seeds germinate within two weeks, at a maximum 2 cm depth. When
      sowing is planned in nursery, the seedlings can be transplanted
      when they reach about 30 cm (3–6 weeks after germination) [12].<br>
      <br>
      The number of seeds per kilogram ranges from 3000 to 9000,
      depending on the variety, with a germination rate of 80%–90% for
      ideal storage conditions (3 °C, 5%–8% moisture). However, the
      viability decreases if seeds remain at ambient temperature and
      high relative humidity, their germination rate dropping to 7.5%
      after three months <br>
      <br>
      Cutting is preferred when seeds availability is scarce and/or when
      labor is not a limiting factor. Ramachandran et al. [14] reports
      that plants raised from seeds produce fruits of poorer quality,
      while Animashaun et al. [15] suggest that trees grown from seeds
      develop longer roots (an advantage for stabilization and access to
      water) compare to that grown from cuttings that have much shorter
      roots.<br>
      <br>
      When hard woodcuttings (1–2 m long 4–16 cm diameter [8,15]) from
      adult trees are planted during the rainy season burying one third
      in the soil, they readily develop roots that in few months reach a
      considerable size [16]. Moringa oleifera is an exceptionally fast
      growing tree, in three months it can be 3 m high and in few years
      reaches 12 m if it is left to growth naturally. Since the tree
      vigorously re-sprouts after cutting, pruning or pollarding are
      usually practiced to enhance lateral branching and give the tree a
      bush shape in order to facilitate the harvest. Nevertheless, since
      literature reports about the good practice management of Moringa
      oleifera are scant, practical trials are needed [12]. Leaves and
      seeds are the parts of the plant of interest. Accordingly, the
      spatial distribution in planting Moringa oleifera trees is
      designed to facilitate the relevant harvest and the management
      practices.<br>
      <br>
      For production of leaves, Moringa oleifera plantation can be
      designed as follows:<br>
      <br>
      (i) intensive production with spacing ranging from 10 cm × 10 cm
      to 20 cm × 20 cm, harvest interval between 35 to 45 days,
      irrigation and fertilization are needed;<br>
      (ii) semintensive production with spacing about 50 cm × 100 cm,
      harvest interval between 50 to 60 days, irrigation and
      fertilization suggested;<br>
      (iii) integrate in an agroforestry system with spacing distance of
      2–4 m between rows, harvest interval around 60 days, fertilization
      and irrigation not strictly necessary.<br>
      <br>
      Production decreases from intensive production to less dense
      spacing (agroforestry system), although a tremendous variability
      can be observed for a given spatial distribution and the same
      cultivation management. For example, the yield of an intensive
      plantation can range from 580 to 40 m/ha/year [15], being season
      dependent with the largest yield in wet or cold season. There is a
      need for further studies to assess optimum spacing and harvest
      intervals that comply with the different climates and production
      systems [17,18,19]. Harvest can be mechanical or manual. Shoots
      are cut at a 0.5–1 m height above the ground; but leaves can be
      picked directly off the tree; this practice, however, albeit
      quicker, leads to a less vigorous re-growth.<br>
      <br>
      For the production of seed a low density plantation has a positive
      effect on yields: typically 2.5 × 2.5 m or 3 × 3 m triangular
      pattern [20]. Fruits (trilobite capsule), referred as pods (brown
      color and dry and split longitudinally), ripen about three months
      after flowering and must be harvested as soon as possible. Each
      pod usually contains about 26 1-cm diameter seeds lined by three
      whitish papery leaflets on the edge. Like for leaves, also the
      production of seed shows a tremendous variability. A single tree
      can produce from 15.000 to 25.000 seeds with an average weight of
      0.3 gr per seed [21]; moreover early flowering varieties produce
      pods in six month, while other varieties require more than one
      year. After pruning, branches develop new pods within 6 months
      [1].<br>
      <br>
      <b>3. Genetic and Breeding</b><br>
      The major Moringa oleifera producer is India with an annual
      production of 1.1 to 1.3 million tons of tender fruits from an
      area of 380 km2 [22]. Information about the production in other
      countries is scarce. The great interest in Moringa oleifera does
      not concern its commercial value, being mainly related to its
      multipurpose uses and its ability to guarantee a reliable yield,
      while other crops cannot, in countries where people are mostly at
      risk of suffering from nutritional deficiencies. Indeed its
      cultivation is localized in developing countries where different
      parts of the plant are utilized: seeds for oil and water
      purification; leaves, seeds and fruits for their high nutritional
      value (nutritional integrator); leaves and seeds for biomass and
      animal feeding; different parts in traditional medicine. Moreover,
      Moringa has been planted around the world and is naturalized in
      many areas (i.e., almost the entire tropical belt) increasing the
      variability of the species.<br>
      <br>
      As Moringa is a cross-pollinated tree, high heterogeneity in form
      and yield is expected. Several works indeed report variability in
      flowering time [23] (from annual type to perennial type), tree
      nature (from deciduous to evergreen), tree shape (from semi spread
      to upright), resistance to hairy caterpillar [22,23,24], flowering
      time (i.e., some tree flowering throughout the year while others
      flower in two distinct season) [14]....<br>
      <br>
      <b>4. Traditional Uses</b><br>
      All plant parts of Moringa oleifera are traditionally used for
      different purposes, but leaves are generally the most used
      [10,41]. In particular, they are used in human and animal
      nutrition and in the traditional medicine. Leaves are rich in
      protein, mineral, beta-carotene and antioxidant compounds, which
      are often lacking among the populations of underdeveloped or
      developing countries. Moringa leaves are added to food
      preparations as integrators of the diet. In traditional medicine,
      these leaves are used to treat several ailments including malaria,
      typhoid fever, parasitic diseases, arthritis, swellings, cuts,
      diseases of the skin, genito-urinary ailments, hypertension and
      diabetes. They are also used to elicit lactation and boost the
      immune system (to treat HIV/AIDS related symptoms)
      [10,41,42,43,44,45], as well as cardiac stimulants and
      contraceptive remedy. One can directly consume either raw and
      dried leaves or the extract of an aqueous infusion.<br>
      <br>
      Similarly, the use of seeds concerns both human nutrition and
      traditional medicine. Barks are boiled in water and soaked in
      alcohol to obtained drinks and infusions that can be used to treat
      stomach ailments (ease stomach pain, ulcer and aiding digestion),
      poor vision, joint pain, diabetes, anemia and hypertension
      [10,43], toothache, hemorrhoids, uterine disorder [10,44]. In a
      well known practice, Moringa seeds are used to sediment impurities
      of water [10].<br>
      <br>
      Roots are soaked in water or alcohol and boiled with other herbs
      to obtained drinks and infusions as remedies for toothache, as
      anthelmintic and antiparalytic [10,41,42] drugs and as sex
      enhancers.<br>
      <br>
      Finally, flowers are used to produce aphrodisiac substances and to
      treat inflammations, muscle diseases, hysteria, tumors and
      enlargement of the spleen [42,44].<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      <b>5. Non Food or Medicinal Uses</b><br>
      Beyond the uses of Moringa as a food and for human health, other
      possible uses exist. It can be used as a natural plant growth
      enhancer; indeed leaves are rich in zeatin (a plant hormone belong
      to the cytokinin group). Leaf extracts can stimulate plant growth
      and increasing crop yield. Researches performed using a spray
      based on leaf extracts of wheat, maize and rice support the wide
      range of beneficial effect on crops [46].<br>
      <br>
      Moringa seed powder can be used for water purification, replacing
      dangerous and expensive chemicals such as aluminum sulfate [10].<br>
      <br>
      Interestingly, leaf extracts and also seed extracts show
      biopesticide activity, effective against larvae and adults of
      Trigoderma granarium and can reduce the incidence of fungi on
      groundnut seeds [46].<br>
      <br>
      One of the interesting applications of Moringa seeds is their
      utilization as biomass for biodiesel production.<br>
      <br>
      Due to the increasing energy demand and environmental problems
      associated with fossil fuels, the improvement of alternative fuels
      and renewable sources of energy is required. Biodiesel can replace
      petroleum-derived oil (petrodiesel), without any sulphur or
      aromatic compound and with lower emission of monoxides,
      hydrocarbons and particulates. Furthermore, biodiesel can reduce
      dependence on imported fuels: a crucial problem in developing
      countries [47].<br>
      <br>
      Moringa seeds have an oil content of 30%–40%, with a high-quality
      fatty acid composition i.e., high oleic acid (&gt;70%) [48]. In
      addition they posses significant resistance to oxidative
      degradation. These proprieties make Moringa oil a good candidate
      to produce biodiesel after transesterificaton [48,49,50]. Biswas
      and John [51], in a study conducted in Australia, report that
      approximately 3030 kg of oil are required to produce 1000 liters
      of biodiesel. Furthermore, an equivalent of 3.03 tonnes/ha of oil
      seeds can be harvested from dry land, and 6.06 tonnes/ha can be
      harvested from irrigated land. Since biodiesel production with
      Moringa seed oil is a second generation production (i.e., not in
      direct competition with existing farmland and with food crops) and
      as Moringa can grown on degraded land, studies suggest that
      Moringa biodiesel is an acceptable substitute to fossil fuels,
      even when compared against biodiesel derived from vegetable oil of
      other species.....<br>

      <b>Abstract</b><br>
      Use of extracts from Moringa oleifera (MO) is of great interest
      for low-cost water treatment. This paper discusses water and salt
      extraction of a coagulant protein from the seed, purification
      using ion exchange, its chemical characteristics, coagulation and

      </div>
      The present invention relates to a growth medium for use to grow
      differentiated Moringa plant tissues into whole plantlets.
      According to the present invention, the growth medium comprises a
      basal medium containing 30-40 g/L of sucrose, 30 g/L of
      D-sorbitol, 0.1 g/L of inositol, and 8-10 g/L of agar. The growth
      medium induces a plant system that has been differentiated from
      plant bodies cultured from plant tissues harvested from stems,
      roots, and leaves, to grow into plantlets over a short period of
      time, and makes it possible to conveniently culture Moringa in a
      large quantity by directly using tissues of Moringa being cultured
      in vitro. Further, due to a high growth rate, the growth medium
      can form an increased number of plantlets and cause the entire
      plantlets to grow within a short period time of four weeks during
      a propagation culture process that expands the culture scale.
      Accordingly, the growth medium enables the supply of Moringa in a
      large quantity to farms, allowing the farms to harvest leaves,
      stems, and roots of Moringa even in the Korean climate which
      permits a rather short cultivation period from May to October, and
      thus contributes to increased income of the farms and replacement
      of imported Moringa.<br>

          Oleifera in vitro plantlets using callus culture</b><br>
        <b>KR20180027116</b><br>
      </div>
      The present invention relates to a method of forming in vitro
      plantlets of moringa. The method comprises: a step of forming a
      callus and inducing multiple shoots in growth medium, and
      redifferentiating plantlets formed; a step of growing the
      redifferentiated plantlets; and a step of acclimatizing the
      plantlets, wherein the step of growing plantlets comprises growing
      plantlets that have been cultured during the step of forming
      plantlets and redifferentiating plant bodies, in a medium prepared
      by adding, to a basal medium, 30-40 g/L of sucrose, 30g/L of
      D-sorbitol, 0.1 g/L of inositol, and 8-10 g/L of agar.
      Accordingly, the method of the present invention is advantageous
      in increasing the number of plantlets by increasing biological
      activities without causing abscission of leaves in a proliferating
      culture process that expands the culture scale, and can shorten
      the total plantlet formation period to 3-4 months, thereby
      enabling the supply of moringa in a large quantity to farms.
      Further, even in the Korean climate which permits a rather short
      cultivation period from May to October, the method of the present
      invention allows harvesting of leaves, stems, and roots in the
