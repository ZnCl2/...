      North Korea has created a wonder drug which not only cures Aids,
      but also eradicates Ebola and cancer, if the latest proclamation
      from the country’s news agency is to be believed*.<br>
      <br>
      An announcement says that the miracle cure consists of ginseng
      grown from fertiliser and a mix of other ingredients- but did not
      reveal the special combination.<br>
      <br>
      The dictatorship, which is known for making far-fetched claims
      about its achievements, says that the medicine will apparently be
      injectable and will be known by the name of Kumdang-2.<br>
      <br>
      In a statement published by Korean Central News Agency of the
      Democratic People’s Republic of Korea to herald the news, Dr Jon
      Sung Hun said: “The researchers insert rare earth elements (REE)
      into insam (gingseng) by applying the mico-elementary fertilizers
      of REE to the fields of insam.”<br>
      <br>
      “The injection is made of extracts from those complex compounds.
      As a strong-immuno-activator, the injection has been recognized to
      prevent different malignant epidemics.”<br>
      <br>
      The drug’s website cites a medical study in Africa where the drug
      was tested on HIV positive patients. It records that every single
      participant in the trial noted an improvement, with 56 per cent
      being completely cured and 44 per cent noting a considering
      improvement in their condition. <br>
      <br>
      The North Korean scientists also revealed that the drug is capable
      of curing ‘a number of cancers’. But did not divulge which ones or
      provide details of the medical trials which support this claim.<br>
      <br>
      The dictatorship is known for making outlandish claims about its
      own prowess. The state claims that Kim Jong Il invented the
      hamburger and had magical powers which meant he did not need to
      use the toilet.<br>
      <br>
      They also claim that he was born atop a North Korean mountain
      prompting a double rainbow and new star to spontaneously appear.
      Unfortunately for the state, records show that he was born in
      Siberia.<br>
      <br>
      Yesterday the UN revealed that around 10.2 million North Koreans
      are currently facing famine as the dictatorship experiences its
      “worst drought for over a hundred years.”<br>

      alcohol because Kumdang-2 Injection prevents, neutralizes or
      removes all side effects and addiction. In particular, when taking

      similarity of any kind.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      <b>3. Notes</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This being a herbal medicine, it can be
      administered without punctuality in disregard of the timetable
      exhibited in the enclosure of its packet. According to the
      hitherto clinical records, the rate of recovery was higher among
      its random users than its punctual users.<br>
      <br>
      2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All the patients with clear knowledge
      of the principles of its dosage have experienced satisfactory
      effects and 95.5% of them resulted in complete cure.<br>
      <br>
      <b>4. Administration</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The “Basic Administration” of Kumdang-2 Injection is: simply on
      the first day, apply 1-2 ampoules; and from the second day,
      depending on the patient’s response, increase every day its
      each-time dose by one ampoule, getting them 1-2 times daily, with
      an interval of 1-2 days on every fifth day; after about 10 days
      (including the days of interval) get 7-8 ampoules each time, 2-3
      times daily, for 2-3 days; then suspend the injection; and later
      depending on the developments of cure, resume the injection. This
      method is oriented from the mechanism of applying a “heavy strike”
      upon the disease after the patient’s body is acclimatized to this
      injection In cases of emergency, by injecting it every 4-6 hours,
      5-8 ampoules each time we could save many dying patients. If the
      patients with no critical severity got from the first day as many
      as 6-8 ampoules each time, they might experience overburden at the
      heart, indigestion and other heavy healing responses, while
      getting little effects on the treatment. On the other hand,
      injection of only 1-2 ampoules everyday for a very long period
      would result in waste of the medicine and failure to obtain
      desired effects. Therefore, it is advisable to follow the above
      “Basic Administration”.<br>

      <br>
      This table is only an exemplary recommendation and is not
      compulsory to follow up. As explained so far, getting 1 -8
      ampoules each time, 1 -3 times a day intramuscularly (IM) and/or
      intravenously (IV), with an interval of 1-2 days on every fifth
      day would be enough. The efficacies of IM and IV are almost the
      same, but according to the hitherto clinical records IM has been
      more effective than IV. It is advisable to get IM for a while and
      then IV because IM might harden the injected part of hip. You
      should vigorously massage the injected part for 5-7 minutes. Once
      the injected part is hardened due to repeated injections and lazy
      massage, place an alcohol-wet pad on the part and vigorously
      massage it longer time or use a massage vibrator. Then the part
      shall be softened again as before. The best way of administration
      is to find out the optimal dosage suited to your constitution and
      disease through your personal experience. * Inject one ampoule on
      the first day and 1 -2 ampoules next day, and then you can decide
      on the further dosages according to your physical response.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      (1) After injections for 2 days as above, if you feel strong,
      refreshed and happy to a satisfactory extent and the former
      symptoms are alleviated remarkably (e.g. remarkable alleviation of
      pain, improvement of face complexion and good digestion), you
      should continue with 3 ampoules in a dose, once daily, for 3 days.
      Thereafter, if you feel complete recovery, you may stop the
      injection. If you do not feel that your disease has been cured,
      you should get the injection for another 4 days before
      discontinuing it for a couple of days. Then, you should follow the
      “Basic Administration”. This will enable almost ail patients to
      reach complete cure. In case of recurrence after a certain period,
      you may either repeat the first and second courses in the above
      table, or administer 5 ampoules in a dose, I -3 times daily,
      whenever felt necessary.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      (2) During the two days’ injection as above, some patients may
      feel that their diseased parts are stimulated to a small extent.
      For example, those with a heart disease or weak heart may feel
      slight throbbing or stifled in their heart and those with
      hepatitis may feel irritated a little in their liver and the
      wounded may feel small pain in their wounds. But healthy parts of
      body may not be felt irritated in any case. Someone might complain
      of throbbing at the heart although he has not any heart disease.
      But the reality would be the other way round: he did know his
      heart had fallen sick. The irritation of the diseased part, being
      a healing response, serves as an indication of rapid healing of
      your disease. Such temporary irritation will disappear in a few
      days. If you feel as above after the 2 days’ injection, you are
      recommended to get 1 -2 ampoules in a dose, once daily, for 2 more
      days, which is followed by an interval of 2 days. After that get 2
      ampoules in one time on the day, and from the subsequent day get
      the injection once a day increasing the each time dose by 1
      ampoule with each passing day for 6-7 days. This will result in
      great efficaciousness. In the event you had failed to reach
      complete cure thereat, you would first take an interval of 2-5
      days, and resume the injection thereafter. From then on, you would
      get 5-6 ampoules in a dose. Volume and frequency would depend on
      your physical condition. Get the injection 2-3 times daily if you
      are in a critical condition and once daily if not.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      (3) After injection of I -2 ampoules in a dose, once daily, for 1
      -2 days, very few patients (less than 0.001 % of the total) felt
      heavily stimulated at the diseased parts and/or experienced
      throbbing or stifled feelings at the heart. Such feelings were
      found especially among feeble girls and weak elders. They are not
      side effects, but signs of healing response. Therefore, you should
      not worry about them. The patient should be convinced that it is a
      favourable condition because in that case he or she could reach
      complete cure faster than others if the daily dosage is properly
      controlled. In such a case, have a break for 1-2 days first and
      then inject 1 ampoule daily or every other day for 5-6 days. This
      will make your body accustomed to this injection, no longer making
      you feel such symptoms. From then on, you would continue with the
      administration increasing your dose until you regain your health
      according to Table-1 “Category 1: For common cases.”<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      (4) In case you feel good mood and small healing response and no
      other changes in your body after the 2 days’ injection, follow
      Table-1.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      (5) In case you feel no slightest change at all in your mood and
      body after the 2 days’ injection, first continue the First Course
      in Table-1. In case you still feel nothing thereafter, you should
      jump over the Second Course to the Third Course. If you had begun
      the First Course of “Category 1,” you would apply the Second and
      Third Courses of “Category 2” and then repeat the Third Course.
      During the injection some patients may experience drowsiness,
      indigestion or stronger sickness. All these symptoms are parts of
      healing response, and they all will disappear 2-3 days later. As
      seen above, it is advisable to get this injection by increasing
      every day the each time dose by 1 ampoule. Should you feel no
      satisfactory progress of cure even after the Third Course of
      Table-1, you would discontinue it and take a break for 2-4 days
      and then inject 6-8 ampoules in a dose, 2-3 times daily, for 3-5
      days, whereupon no failure of satisfactory cure has been recorded
      so far. There are a large number of cases, which had failed to
      respond to other medicines, but reached complete cures upon this
      injection. In a word, the efficaciousness of this injection does
      not depend on the total quantity injected, but largely depends on
      whether the volumes and frequencies of injection are correctly
      adopted depending on the patient’s condition and his particular
      disease.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      (6) We can imagine some cases where, even though followed (5)
      above, nothing felt and nothing happened (although such cases
      almost never happened): If you had not felt any distinctive
      improvements after 7-15 days of injection, it could be explained
      that your condition were far better than those who could not apply
      maximum dose because the diseased parts were felt too much
      painful. In that case, your condition would serve as an evident
      sign that by freely applying maximum doses you would easily reach
      complete cure. Administration of maximum dose is as follows:<br>
      <br>
      1st&nbsp; day: 5 ampoules x 2 times<br>
      2nd day: 5 ampoules x 3 times<br>
      3rd day: 6 ampoules x 3 times<br>
      4th day: 7 ampoules x 3 times<br>
      5th day:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Break<br>
      6th day: 7 ampoules x 3 times<br>
      7th day: 8 ampoules x 3 times<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;* In severe cases of high fever, malignant influenza,
      epidemic diseases, etc., injecting 5-7 ampoules each time, for 3-4
      times continuously with an interval of only 5-10 minutes between
      injections mostly resulted in instant lull recovery.<br>
      <br>
      <b>5. Contraindications</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      &nbsp;No contraindications have been reported. In the period of
      administration, you need not refrain from drinking or become too
      sensitive to foods. As no medicines antagonistic to Kumdang-2
      Injection have so far been found, you may use Kumdang-2 Injection
      with any other medicines depending on your conditions.<br>
      <br>
      <b>6. Adverse Effects</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      &nbsp;No adverse side effects have been found so far.<br>
      <br>
      <b>7. Precautions</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      1) Kumdang-2 Injection is synergic with other medicines.
      Therefore, simultaneous use with other medicines would result in
      better effects, in which case Kumdang-2 should be injected by a
      separate syringe with exception of cocarboxylase and vitamin ?1,
      which can be mixed with Kumdang-2 in the same syringe. Dilution of
      Kumdang-2 Injection in such dropper solutions as dextrose
      (glucose) and Ringer’s solution is not encouragible as it may not
      help to maximize its effects because its micro-elements having
      been already largely diluted in it, their excessive dilution may
      cause decrease of their medicinal effects. Therefore, separate IM
      or IV injection of Kumdang-2 before or after dropping
      (instillation of) other solutions is advisable. It is important to
      keep the principle of getting 1-2 ampoules on the first day and
      increasing the volume of injection from the next day as described
      above. For 20-28 days you may continue the injection with a break
      of 1-2 days after each 4 days. Once the 20-28 days’ course is
      completed, you may have an interval of 3-7 days. Then in
      accordance with your resultant condition you may either
      discontinue the injection for good or begin a few course. Such
      in-course intervals are aimed at fully discharging the rare-earth
      elements after their medicinal actions properly done, thus
      avoiding their in-body accumulations. When resuming another course
      after a short or long time, you would start with 5 or more
      ampoules as each time dose. At this stage, continuous everyday
      injection is advisable, but it is more advisable to get injections
      only when you feel like doing it or feel unwell in the range of
      5-8 ampoules each time and 1-3 times a day.<br>
      <br>
      2) Excess of the above said “maximum dosage” is unadvisable.<br>
      <br>
      3) Some patients complained that although they had enjoyed good
      effects during the course of injections, upon stop thereof the
      good effects disappeared. But, later they felt improvements again
      without resuming dosage. There were some cases that the results
      had not been so much satisfactory after the first course only, but
      they were fully satisfied after the second or the third course.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;4) For some 30 days after full recovery, you should refrain
      from some overburdens, e.g. excessive drinking, too much exercise
      and hard labour because although you would feel invigorated and
      pleasant from your recovery, your physical conditions are still in
      a feeble state like a flower in a green house. After the said
      30days your physical conditions will return to the original state,
      so no particular cautions are recommended from then on. There were
      some patients who, feeling pleasant and strong after recovery from
      illness by help of Kumdang-2 Injection, had ignored the
      convalescence period of 30 days and during that period drank
      excessively and overworked, thereby falling ill again. Once the
      disease relapsed like that you would take longer courses of
      injection of Kumdang-2, consuming far more ampoules.<br>
      <br>
      5) Upon injection (mostly IV) of any medicines including Kumdang-2
      Injection, very few patients might suffer from temporary fever and
      chill. According to the hitherto evidences, such fever and chill
      have not been caused by the injected medicines, but were caused by
      some pyrogen (generator of fever) formed in the
      single-use-syringes owing to their improper handling or improper
      result of their in-process automatic sterilization. In such a
      case, you should first discontinue the injection and stop the
      lever and chill by 2 tablets of aspirin (If the patient does not
      respond to aspirin, inject camphor and dimedrolum along with
      intakes of aspirin.). Then, using a syringe of another brand,
      inject (IM) 1 ampoule (or half an ampoule) of Kumdang-2 once in 2
      days, whereupon you may start carefully increasing the daily
      dosage. Thereupon, you will experience far better effects than the
      patients devoid of such negative response.&nbsp; <br>

      <b>8. Clinical study</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      <i>Allergic skin diseases</i><i><br>
      </i><br>
      Kumdang-2 Injection has recorded excellent clinical effects in
      curing various allergic skin diseases and dermatitis including
      nettle rash on the face or the body caused by various factors.
      There have been many cases of skin diseases, which had failed of
      cure on any strong medicines, but were completely cured on
      Kumdang-2 Injection. As far as skin diseases are concerned, in
      addition to the powerful efficacies on its injecting, the liquid
      content of Kumdang-2 has been highly effective, too, on its
      applying to the diseased skin like the medicines of external use.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;<i>Ambustion, Chilblain and Electric Injury (Injuries by
        burn, freezing and electric shock)</i><i><br>
      </i><br>
      In treatments of injuries or traumas by bum, freezing and electric
      shock, Kumdang-2 Injection achieved wonderful results in both of
      its single and combined uses. Among the Kumdang-2 injected
      patients the speed of recovery was 10 times faster than the
      uninjected. Further, the injected patients were quite safe from
      any other complicating diseases.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Engorgement</i><i><br>
      </i><br>
      When a man falls from a cliff or gets injured in a car accident or
      military battle, skin chaps, bruise and edema appear, the blood is
      gathered in several parts of the body and bones are broken.
      Administration of Kumdang-2 Injection in those cases recovered all
      the injuries more than 8 times faster than other medicines. Many
      patients, who had been diagnosed for over 6 months’ intensive
      in-bed treatment, wearing plasters on several parts, and foreseen
      to be disabled even after recovery, completely revived to a normal
      workable state in only 20 days of its injecting, whereupon they
      could even run all the way home like sportsmen. According to the
      clinic records, there have been many cases, where some seriously
      injured men being in state of coma breathing last breaths revived
      to this world after its injection every 4 hours, 6-8 ampoules each
      time.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Cosmetic Effects</i><i><br>
      </i><br>
      Kumdang-2 Injection is accepted as a far better alternative to
      cosmetics. Its cosmetic effects were distinctive among those who
      used it according to “4. Administration”. Moreover, even only
      applying it on the face, not injecting it, produced results better
      than the deluxe cosmetics. You may apply as follows: after getting
      up in the morning, wash your face; pour half or more of the liquid
      from an ampoule into your palm; and apply it evenly on your face
      in the same way as you do with lotion. Repeat the same in the
      evening. You may or may not further make up your face after
      applying the liquid on the face. Cosmetic effects were more vivid
      when it was both applied on the face and injected to the body
      because in that case, proliferation of healthy cells started both
      from exterior skin and from inside. Clinical records have shown
      many good signs on the face: many wrinkles were removed,
      granulomas became smaller or removed, and the loosened muscles
      turned tense resulting in fine complexion. Blackheads, dark dots,
      freckles, hives, pimples, rashes and all kinds of inflammations
      disappeared, the facial skin and flesh became clear, soft, white,
      tender, elastic and smooth, and the eyes glistened.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Diabetes</i><i><br>
      </i><br>
      Once diabetes breaks out, you may experience increase of urine,
      and feel thirsty, lethargic and hungry before mealtime. Injection
      of Kumdang-2 at this stage removed those symptoms and mostly
      resulted in complete cure. At the initial stage of the disease the
      recovery rate was around 68%. It was effective for chronic
      diabetes, too. It noticeably lessened or eliminated diabetic
      symptoms and returned the blood-sugar level to normal, but the
      full recovery rate was only 36%. Administration of this injection
      coupled with the anti-diabetic medicines, such as Glyclazide,
      Metformine, Gluriad, Amaryl (Glimepirid), Manilin, etc. proved
      more effective in improving the relevant symptoms and the
      blood-sugar level than when the diabetes medicines were applied
      alone. Application of Kumdang-2 in a concerted prescription as
      above decreased by far the dependence on insulin among the
      patients of diabetes Type I and lowered the rate of their
      conversion from Type II (Non-depending on insulin) to Type I
      (depending on insulin). This injection was also successful in
      preventing various complicating diseases related with diabetes.
      Its great effectiveness in the treatment of diabetes lies in the
      fact that it optimizes the autonomic nervous system, and
      especially prestisol (activated by rare earths) and other insam
      extracts, which it contains, stimulate pancreas, thereby
      accelerating insulin secretion and promote lipidic synthesis, with
      the result that the increased rate of sugar absorption reduces the
      blood-sugar level.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Different kinds of inflammation, Fevers of unknown reasons,
        Loss of appetite</i><i><br>
      </i><br>
      In the clinical practice. Kumdang-2 Injection, on the strength of
      its mechanism, has shown strong anti-inflammatory effects. When it
      was administered alone, the inflammation was well reduced. When it
      was administered together with antibiotics better effects were
      produced and no side effects on the liver and digestion caused by
      antibiotics were witnessed. Therefore, it was good to compulsorily
      inject Kumdang-2 whenever antibiotics were used, in which case a
      separate syringe was used.&nbsp; Fevers of unknown reasons There
      have been many cases where the cause of fever could not be found
      even after repeated examinations and tests. Kumdang-2 Injection
      quickly lowered the fever to normalcy and the injected patients
      were completely restored to a good health. Loss of appetite In
      cases of loss of appetite for various reasons, Kumdang-2 Injection
      stimulated appetite to the necessary degree without causing
      obesity or excessive appetite. This is because this injection only
      normalizes the appetite-control and digestive functions in the
      course of optimizing the nervous system and does not increase
      appetite indiscriminately. On the other hand, it neither
      diminishes appetite, nor cures obesity.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Disorders before and after child-delivery</i><i><br>
      </i><br>
      (a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before delivery Administration of Kumdang-2
      Injection to the sufferers of serious morning sickness in the
      first half of pregnancy removed nausea, made them feel refreshed,
      normalized appetite, and prevented debility and toxemia of
      pregnancy. Moreover, those already taken ill of toxemia of
      pregnancy were also swiftly recovered therefrom by Kumdang-2
      Injection. The injection also demonstrated good effects on various
      diseases of pregnant women such as liver, stomach and heart
      disorders and polyps. The women administered with the injection
      before or during pregnancy did not catch cold and other infectious
      diseases and had an easy delivery of healthy babies. And the
      babies bom from Kumdang-2 injected women had a stronger resistance
      to diseases and grew up taster and healthier than those from the
      uninjected women. (b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After delivery Shortly
      after delivery, women are likely to suffer from autonomic nerve
      imbalance (vegetative neurosis) and blood circulation disorder
      caused by tension of the sympathetic nerve and negative stimulus
      on the hypothalamus, that had stemmed from postpartum malnutrition
      and cardiac weakness. These are known as postpartum diseases.
      According to the clinical records, injection of Kumdang-2
      immediately after delivery dealt a positive strike on the
      hypothalamus, thereby optimizing the systems of autonomic nerve
      and immunity with the result that autonomic imbalance and
      disorders of blood circulation did not occur. Therefore, there
      appeared no such symptoms as feeling as if head and the whole body
      are exposed to the wind, heavy cold sweat, body chill, dizziness,
      lumbago, debility, stomachache, sharp pains all over the body and
      palpitation of the heart; and after delivery, women got healthier
      than before pregnancy. In addition to the said preventive action,
      Kumdang-2 Injection successfully cured all the postpartum diseases
      that had outbroken among the uninjected women.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Drug Addiction</i><i><br>
      </i><br>
      There is no drug addiction in our country. Therefore we only
      studied the reports from foreign hospitals and the medical teams
      of DPR Korea touring in foreign countries. The records of treating
      the patients addicted to the following narcotic drugs and
      stimulants were reported: Drugs of opium alkaloids: morphine,
      codeine, thebaine, heroin and dehydrocodeine Drugs of
      coca-alkaloids: cocaine Synthetic drugs: dehydroetropen and
      promedol Stimulants similar to narcotic drugs: hashish, marihuana,
      Philopon, Ice. and amphetamine. The drug addicts were suffering
      from: the symptoms of serious mental trouble and the depressed
      functions of all organs owing to the disturbed autonomic nervous
      system. The pulmonary fibrosis and heart failure gave rise to
      heart disorder, and the continuing expansion of the blood vessels
      by drugs decreased their elasticity, slowing down the blood flow.
      Moreover, diarrhea failed to discontinue due to the trouble of
      intestinal movements and the functional disorder of the liver and
      kidney. Upon injection of Kumdang-2 to the drug addicts as per “4.
      Administration”, the autonomic nervous system came back to
      normalcy, the intestines were quickly recovered, the symptoms of
      mental disorder disappeared, blood began to flow normally and the
      diarrhea discontinued. Further, their mental dependence on drugs
      and the abstinence distress were lessened sharply or disappeared
      for good. As a result, the drug addiction was completely cured.
      The drug addicts who, had used to fall in the abstinence distress
      if forced to unuse the drug after few hours of its previous use,
      were delighted very much to experience their symptoms considerably
      weakened or eliminated. (Abstinence distress is: if a strong
      demand for drug is unquenched, the addict starts sneezing,
      shedding tears, dribbling, dilatation of the eye pupils, fuli-body
      spasm, tongue twists; severe pain in the joints and muscles,
      chill, vomiting and feeling faint after 24 hours; and thereafter
      rolling to and fro, biting his own fingers and striking themselves
      against anywhere to be stained with blood all over.) Nevertheless,
      some of them returned to their former state of addiction because
      they used drugs again. Only those with the consciousness of their
      own destiny and strong will could be fully recovered from drug
      addiction.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Epidemic diseases including Bird Flu and New Flu, AIDS</i><i><br>
      </i><br>
      Nowadays, every country is called to direct greater efforts to
      preventing different kinds of possible epidemic diseases. If a
      vaccine of a new epidemic should be invented only after outbreak
      of the epidemic, during this time of invention, the epidemic would
      already have prevailed widely. If viruses of New Flu. Bird Flu and
      AIDS would mutate, their infectiousness and mortality would boost
      on geometric steps and the humanity would fall in unforeseen
      disasters. In general, while the DNA genes do not change through
      generations, the gene of New Flu virus is RNA, which is always
      likely to mutate. The same is the case with Bird Flu and AIDS.
      Therefore, the world health entities are calling the humanity to
      take perspective anti-epidemic measures in advance of coming
      mutations of the epidemic viruses. For this purpose, you should be
      armed with optimum immuno-competence defensive of all viruses
      including those that would emerge in new shapes after mutation.
      This is obtainable only by optimizing the human immunity try use
      of very strong imimmo-activators and interferon inducers like
      Kumdang-2 Injection. According to the data from foreign health
      entities this injection has shown splendid effects in preventing
      and curing some epidemics such SALES, Dird Flu, New Flu and AIDS.
      according to the reports from our medical teams in Africa, upon
      injection of Kumdang-2 in the maximum dose of more to the HIV
      (human immuno-deficiency virus) anti-body carriers, 63.5 % of the
      injected total recorded disappearance of HIV anti-body in the
      tests. Among the patients with typical syndromes of AIDS, its
      injection in repeated maximum doses resulted in 56 % complete cure
      and 44 % considerable cure. There was no case of on improved or
      deteriorated. Among those injected of enough Kumdang-2 for
      prevention, no case of AIDS has been reported. For prevent of
      above epidemics, you are recommended to get 40-56 ampoules as per
      Table-1, and for cure, get 5-8 ampoules, every 4-6 hours for 2-3
      days. If you failed to reach complete cure during that time, the
      same dosage should be repeated for 2-3 days after an interval of
      1-2 days, whereupon you should be assured of perfect cure in any
      case.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Gastric hemorrhage</i><i><br>
      </i><br>
      When the hemostatic IM injections such as vitamin ??, adona and
      thromboplastin, were administered together with this injection,
      while applying ice massage on the affected gastric part, gastric
      hemorrhage discontinued soon, followed by disappearance of bodily
      malfunction and lethargy from bleeding. But, in many cases, single
      use of Kumdang-2 Injection was better.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Stomach cramp</i><i><br>
      </i><br>
      At an outbreak of stomach cramp, injection of Kumdang-2 every 4
      hours, 5 ampoules at a time soon stopped the cramp and its
      recurrence. According to your doctor’s advice, you may take at the
      same time injection of either 0.1% atropine sulphate or 2%
      papaverin hydrochloride. (4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No effective remedy
      is known available for cures of gastric neurosis, attack of
      indigestion, gastric atonia and post-gastrectomy syndrome; but
      Kumdang-2 Injection proved to be very much effective for those
      diseases.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Diseases of large and small intestines</i><i><br>
      </i><br>
      The general anti-diarrhea medicines need a continuous use because
      of their incapability to cure colitis completely, and their
      efficacy gradually diminish on continuous use. And antibiotics are
      not a cure-all for colitis as they damage the liver and fail to
      restore the organo-pathic degradation inside the large intestine.
      But, Kumdang-2 Injection kills the colon bacillus, stops the loose
      bowel, removes the inflammation therein and restores the organic
      degradation inside the large intestine, thus accomplishing
      complete cure of colitis for good. This injection not only swiftly
      cured acute colitis as above, but also, just in a few days,
      completely cured tens of year long severe chronic colitises. After
      application of this injection, the constitutional habit of
      frequent diarrhea changed to absence of diarrhea, and even in case
      of accidental diarrhea due to disorderly eating, it stopped on its
      own in one day without help of anti-diarrheal pills. Kumdang-2
      Injection swiftly and completely terminated all the symptoms of
      acute &amp; chronic colitis and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS),
      including such severe symptoms as abdominal pain, loose bowel and
      fever, which had failed to respond even to antibiotics.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Heart Diseases, Arthritis</i><i><br>
      </i><br>
      Thanks to its powerful mechanism, Kumdang-2 Injection recorded 98%
      of complete recovery in treatments of cardioneurosis and
      arrhythmia (irregular pulsation), and 70% and 57% in treatments of
      ischemic heart diseases (IHD) and stenocardia respectively.
      Arthritis (1) Rheumatic arthritis Kumdang-2 Injection’s mechanism
      of curing arthritis differs from other medicines, e.g. this
      injection cures not only arthritis, but also the heart disorder, a
      disease accompanying arthritis. Thanks to this mechanism,
      Kumdang-2 could give a chance of full recovery to the patients who
      had only been suffering from the adverse effects of other
      medicines without progress in cure of arthritis. By the way, some
      of the patients, who, instead of applying at least one full
      course, had suspended the injection after one or two doses only as
      they felt no pain on the diseased joints or found the swelling
      thereon gone down, fell ill again some days later. Nevertheless,
      most of the patients who followed “4. Administration” properly
      recovered for good. (2) Rheumatoid Kumdang-2 Injection proved
      efficacious in treatment of rheumatoid, a form of chronic
      arthritis accompanied with transformation of bone joints and
      muscular contraction. Pains at the joints reduced markedly or
      disappeared, swelling in the joints shrank to a certain degree and
      atrophied muscles around the joints came back to normalcy. But the
      rate of full recovery was not high.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Hypotension (LOW blood pressure)</i><i><br>
      </i><br>
      The main symptoms of hypotension are headache, failure of memory,
      debility, fatigue, dwindling, body chill, heart disorders and
      anemia. It has been known so far that there is no specific remedy
      for hypotension except some selective diets and exercises. But
      Kumdang-2 Injection has demonstrated marvelous effects on
      hypotension of various causes with very high records of complete
      cure.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Impotence</i><i><br>
      </i><br>
      Kumdang-2 Injection enlarges the sperm secretion, filling the
      spermatic sack to the full, activates the spermatozoa, and
      improves adrenocortical function, thereby making people vigorous.
      On the strength of this mechanism, it enhanced the sexual
      function, and recorded a high recovery rate in cures of impotence.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Infection, adhesion and scar after medical operation</i><i><br>
      </i><br>
      When Kumdang-2 Injection was administered according to “4.
      Administration” above just after medical operation of any part of
      the body, infections and adhesions were fully prevented, any
      sequela (adverse after effects) did not appear and the operated
      marks were healed up beautifully or without trace. The patients
      who had been injected of Kumdang-2 after medical operation were 8
      times faster in speed of recovery than the uninjected. There was
      not any noticeable difference in the recovery speed between its
      single use and its use combined with other medicines after medical
      operation.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Liver disorders caused by alcohol:</i><i><br>
      </i><br>
      Heavy drinking of alcohol disturbs metabolism of liver cells and
      causes accumulation of fat in the liver and expedites liver
      fibrosis, resulting in alcoholic liver disorder. This leads to
      alcoholic acute and chronic hepatitis and, further, to liver
      cirrhosis and cancer. In treatments of alcoholic liver disorders,
      Kumdang-2 Injection achieved 98 % of full recovery. For everybody
      including those not suspected of alcoholic liver disorder,
      injecting 4-6 ampoules in one time before or after heavy drinking
      has been enough to maintain fresh condition and prevent the said
      disease. A Liver disorders caused by antibiotic, analgesic,
      antifebrile and other medicines: Vitamins have been used against
      such side effects as liver disorder, indigestion, heart troubles,
      etc caused by various medicines including antibiotic, but they
      could not prevent or cure them completely. Simultaneous
      administration of Kumdang-2 Injection made it possible to prevent
      those side effects completely, maximizing at the same time the
      efficacies of the said medicines. A Liver cancer: The anti-cancer
      medicines used in treatments of liver cancer include Adriamycin,
      Mytomycin. 5-FU, Cisplatin, metoxantron and the like. But they
      cause malfunctioning of the liver, weakening of key internal
      organs, disorder of hematogenic system and stomach disorders.
      Getting Kumdang-2 Injection together with them, made it possible
      to remove such negative effects and increase their anti-cancer
      effects. At present, immunotherapy is widely used in treatments of
      liver cancer, and Kumdang-2 Injection has been proved to be one of
      the best choices for the immunotherapy. It remarkably activated
      such immune tools as white blood corpuscles and lymphocytes in
      their roles of detecting the cancer cells of liver and suppressing
      and suspending their proliferations with the result of much higher
      rate of survival among its patients. 2) Stomach Diseases (1)
      Kumdang-2 Injection recorded far better clinical results than
      other medicines in treatments of acute and chronic gastritis,
      atrophic gastritis and stomach &amp; duodenal ulcer. Depending on
      the symptoms of patients, simultaneous use of Kumdang-2 Injection
      with: Atropine injection. Scopolia stomachic tablets, Vicazon,
      Magnesium hydroxide tablets, Pepsin, Pancreatin, steroid hormone,
      Cimetidine, Zantac or Ulcerlmin all produced good results. But
      single use of Kumdang-2 Injection was better: the symptoms
      disappeared much earlier and the rate of recovery was far higher
      than combined use with the said medicines.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Malignant influenza and other kinds of cold</i><i><br>
      </i><br>
      The most effective method to prevent or cure different kinds of
      cold and influenza is to optimize the immuno-competence of the
      body against colds by use of immuno-activator or interferon
      inducer, while training the body. Kumdang-2 Injection has been
      recognized world-wide as one of most effective immuno-activators
      and interferon inducers. According to the clinical practice, 24-56
      ampoules (3-7 packets)of this injection optimized the
      immuno-competence, resulting in successful prevention of colds and
      flues, and even in cases of their outbreak, the injected ailed
      mildly and recovered shortly. This injection alone was enough to
      cure malignant influenza and colds, but its simultaneous use with
      other cold remedies resulted in better records. In case of failure
      of satisfactory cure after 1 -2 times of injection, inject every
      5-10 minutes, 5-8 ampoules each time, 3-5 times daily, whereby 1-2
      days were enough for complete cure of any cold or flue of any
      severity.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Medicinal poisoning</i><i><br>
      </i><br>
      Kumdang-2 Injection attained 98% of complete recovery in removing
      or neutralizing various forms of medicinal poisoning. For
      instance, according to a report from abroad, a woman, aged 40, had
      taken 200 pills of Isoniazid at a time in an attempt to commit
      suicide and lost her consciousness. The 5% dextrose solution was
      infused but in vain. However, she came to herself soon after
      receiving 8 ampoules of this injection in a dose. Further, she got
      8 ampoules 3 times in a day, whereupon, she was completely
      recovered to her original state, rose and even washed her clothes
      in the washroom. A lot of similar examples have been recorded.
      Harm from use of computers Kumdang-2 Injection swiftly relieved
      the fatigue and various disorders of the body caused by constant
      computer work for many hours during many days. Stomatitis
      Stomatitis, i.e. the erosion and/or ulcer in the mucous membrane
      of the mouth, may appear due to high fever, pregnancy, excessive
      mental or physical fatigue, or extreme weakness. Upon injection of
      Kumdang-2 as per “4. Administration”, stomatitis was soon cured
      and the immunity being optimized, the rate of its recurrence
      sharply decreased.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Neuralgia</i><i><br>
      </i><br>
      In treatments of different kinds of neuralgia, like trigeminal
      neuralgia, headache, intercostal neuralgia, sciatica and
      brachilgia, Kumdang-2 Injection eased or stopped pains, and its
      use together with vitamins and other medicines was more effective
      than its single use.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Neurosis</i><i><br>
      </i><br>
      Kumdang-2 Injection achieved more than 95% of full recovery rate
      in treatments of neurosis (also called noirase) known as a
      non-psychopathic disorder marked by an uneasy state of mind and
      attempts to escape from it<br>
      <br>
      <i>Debility</i><i><br>
      </i><br>
      In treatments of different kinds of syndromes of debility e. g.
      bony body, lethargy, loss of appetite, cold hands and feet,
      malfunctions and under-growth for a variety of reasons, the rate
      of full recovery by this injection was over 99%.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Insomnia</i><i><br>
      </i><br>
      Insomnia is caused by malfunctioning of the Reticular Substance of
      Mesencephalon (RSM), which balances sleep and awakeness. In
      general, the sleeping pills force you to sleep by suppressing RSM
      and the central nervous system including the cerebral cortex,
      which causes counter-action from RSM that results in gradual in
      crease of the daily dose of the pills, and eventually, even
      greater dose of the pills would not help you to sleep, thus
      resulting in addiction. Further, the pills entail side effects,
      e.g. dry mouth and nausea. Kumdang-2 Injection, by normalizing and
      optimizing the functions of RSM and central nervous system, could
      achieve 96% of complete recovery from insomnia without any side
      effects.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Pancreatitis</i><i><br>
      </i><br>
      Kumdang-2 Injection was surprisingly quick in curing acute and
      chronic pancreatitis, and the recovery rate was 94%.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Poisoning by perished food (Food Poisoning or Bromatoxism)</i><i><br>
      </i><br>
      Kumdang-2 Injection achieved good clinical results in cures of
      food poisoning. Its effects were remarkable both in single and
      combined uses. In very severe cases, Kumdang-2 was highly
      effective when used simultaneously with the first-aid treatment.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Thyroid Diseases</i><i><br>
      </i><br>
      In treatments of such malignant diseases as hyperthyreosis
      (hyper-thyroidism), simple struma and thyroid inflammation,
      Kumdang-2 Injection achieved 96% of complete recovery. Iodine and
      other usual prescriptions to treat thyroid diseases were low at
      the recovery rate, and the relevant symptoms that had been
      alleviated in the initial stage turned more serious upon expiry of
      their medicinal action. But, this injection was exclusively
      effective.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Polyps</i><i><br>
      </i><br>
      Kumdang-2 Injection remarkably reduced or removed polyps in the
      stomach, lung, uterine, mouth and nose along with simultaneous
      decrease of their symptoms and recurrence. Administration of more
      than 200 ampoules (25 packets) showed a satisfactory effect, but
      less ampoules were not adequate for complete cure.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Myalgia (pains at muscles)</i><i><br>
      </i><br>
      Kumdang-2 Injection alleviated or removed the pains at the muscles
      or all over the body. The rate of complete recovery was 65%.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Vegetative Neurosis (disorders of vegetative nervous system)</i><i><br>
      </i><br>
      Nearly all the diseases are related to vegetative neurosis, so it
      is hard to give specific description of its symptoms. Anyway, at
      least its main symptoms are debility, dizziness, tinnitus, pale
      complexion, headache, nausea, palpitation of the heart, insomnia,
      etc. So far, there has not been any noticeable remedy available
      for cure of this disease. But, Kumdang-2 Injection demonstrated
      clear effects on it from the first day of its use, remarkably
      alleviating or removing all those symptoms. The rate of complete
      recovery was 95%.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Spontaneous Gangrene, Epilepsy</i><i><br>
      </i><br>
      The symptoms of spontaneous gangrene are gangrene and anemia in
      the fingers or toes caused by disorder of peripheral blood
      circulation. After administration of Kumdang-2 Injection, the
      affected parts, which had been dusky blue, turned light pink and
      rose to a normal temperature. Other symptoms, including severe
      pain, subsided remarkably. The efficacy of the injection was
      increased when it was used in combination with other medicines
      like Royal Blood-Fresh. Epilepsy Kumdang-2 Injection was tried for
      epilepsy with the belief that it would be helpful in view of its
      mechanism, and it was proved to be worth trying. Depending on the
      conditions of patients, the injection was administered alone or in
      combination with other medicines. In most cases, the frequency of
      spasm decreased considerably, there was a remarkable improvement
      in the form of spasm, and the brain wave was also improved. The
      recovery rate was some 36%.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Sterility caused by undergrowth, Menstrual disorders, Cystitis</i><i><br>
      </i><br>
      There are many causes for sterility. K.umdang-2 Injection was
      administered to some women who had failed to get pregnant owing to
      underdevelopment of their reproductive organs. Their body
      temperature during the ovulatory period came back to normalcy, and
      they got pregnant and delivered babies easily. Menstrual disorders
      The young women who were suffering from irregular period of
      menstruation, excess or lack of bleeding, and dysmenorrhea,
      started to perform punctual menstruation upon injection of
      K.umdang-2. It has also proved efficacious in curing menopausal
      disorders e.g. over-extended cycle and insufficient bleeding. It
      has improved their sexual desire, too. Cystitis Antibiotics such
      as Gentamicin and Toxycyclin, when used for cure of cystitis,
      cause liver disorder, which entail indigestion, loss of appetite
      and debility. Use of Kumdang-2 Injection in combination with the
      antibiotics fully prevented or removed the said side effects and
      markedly raised the rate of recovery.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Stimulant to children’s growth, Anti-radioactive</i><i><br>
      </i><br>
      When Kumdang-2 Injection was administered to children,
      particularly those who were weak and short for their ages, and
      often lost appetite; they ate much, growing taller and stronger
      than the uninjected. Anti-radioactive and anti-sandy-dust effects
      According to the concepts updated in 1977 by the International
      Commission for Radioactivity Protection, upon exposure of human
      body to excessive radioactivity, the white blood corpuscles,
      lymphocytes and blood platelets may decrease causing deterioration
      of immunity, possibly resulting in outbreaks of various infectious
      diseases, functional disorders and cancer. Therefore, subject that
      your powers of immunity and anti-oxidation be optimized by use of
      immuno-activators and anti-oxidants, you may easily prevent or
      cure damages by not too dangerous radioactivities. Over the last
      many years’ clinical practices, Kumdang-2 Injection has been
      recognized as a wonderful vaccine and cure of the radioactive
      damages. Among those properly dosed with Kumdang-2 Injection and
      Royal Blood-Fresh, a typical anti-oxidant no case of radioactive
      damage has been recorded after their visits to the
      radio-contaminated areas and even after their exposure up to 5 Gy
      (Gray) of radioactive rays. It has also been proved that once your
      immunity is optimized by use of Kumdang-2 Injection, the possible
      damages of the eyes and the respiratory organs by the sandy dust
      shall well be prevented. 56-80 ampoules of Kumdang-2 Injection
      would be enough to prevent damages of radioactivity and sandy dust
      and for cure thereof you are recommended to follow “4.
      Administration”<br>
      <br>
      <i>Treatment Hepatitis</i><i><br>
      </i><br>
      (1) There are various types of viral hepatitis, such as Type ?, ?,
      C, D, E and G, all of which have both acute and chronic stages.
      And those viruses are the main causes of cirrhosis, ascites and
      abscess of the liver. Such anti-viral agents as Entecavir,
      Adepovir, Peg-Interferon, Ramibudin. Livaberin, Pegasis and others
      have recently been in use for treatments of viral hepatitis. These
      anti-viral agents, though efficacious in many cases, have negative
      effects, e.g. inhibition of bone marrows, and owing to shortage of
      durations of action, only partially inhibit proliferation of the
      hepatitis viruses and therefore, are incapable of fully rejecting
      the viruses. They entail intolerable adverse side effects that
      cause great pains. Therefore, they are not in wide use. (2) Toxic
      hepatitis, another kind of hepatitis, caused by medicament,
      alcohol, bacteria, poisons, etc., cholestatic hepatitis and liver
      troubles caused by metabolic disorders are treated with the
      medicines that restore the function of diseased liver cells and
      help restoration of the parenchyma of liver (Cocarboxylase,
      Liv-52, Alinamin-F, Essential, Carsil, Legalon, etc). But. as they
      have some shortcomings, patients are calling for better medicines.
      The fatty liver, a liver trouble caused by metabolic disorder, is
      treated with methionine, choline, lecithin, cholestine and so on.
      But each of them has some side effects and acts only on certain
      parts. So they are not successfully curing the fatty liver in an
      all-round way. The complex amino acid agents (Alvesin and
      Moriamin) and albumin that accelerate the synthesis of protein are
      used to supplement the insufficient serum protein. The Minofagen-C
      Forte had been widely used as it radically reduces the enzyme in
      the cases of enzyme-sustaining active hepatitis. But, as its
      effect of restoring liver cells was not clear, the rate of
      recurrence being high, the level of enzyme rising again, and the
      immunity being heavily suppressed, it is nowadays unrecommended in
      cases of liver cirrhosis, hepatogenic coma, diabetes and
      hypertension. (3) Kumdang-2 Injection’s mechanism of curing
      hepatitis A liver cell has so-called “keyhole” composed of
      protein, which admits Interferon. Kumdang-2 Injection not only
      boosts over 16 times the human body’s capacity of generating the
      Interferon, which plays the role as the “key” to enter the
      “keyhole”, but also helps the Interferon pass the “keyhole”, enter
      the liver cell and act on its nucleus, thereby producing various
      anti-viral enzymes. All the actions of this injection, such as
      restoration and proliferation of cells, activation of immunity,
      anti-viral and anti-inflammatory effects, optimization of the
      systems of autonomic nerves and self-curing, improvement of
      Interferon-generating capacity, and maintenance of homeostasis,
      serve in the first place for cures of hepatitis. Kumdang-2 not
      only suppresses and eliminates the virus of hepatitis, but also
      restrains progression of the disease in the parenchyma of liver
      and expedites its restoration. Therefore, it successfully cures
      not only viral hepatitis is, but also toxic hepatitis, cholestatic
      hepatitis and the liver troubles caused by metabolic disorders.
      (4) Clinical records and therapeutic experience In the course of
      treating hepatitis, the test values of GPT (ALT), GOT (AST),
      Thymol (TTT), Kunkel (ZnTT), mallein, total protein amount,
      albumin/globulin (A/G) and r-globulin were improved faster than
      other medicines, and 88% of patients recovered completely. The
      tests of HBs antigen, too, showed good achievements. As far as the
      method of use is concerned, the above “4. Administration” that
      does not differ disease by disease was the best option. Dispensing
      Kumdang-2 Injection as a single prescription resulted in
      satisfactory records, and in some cases dispensing it as a
      component of double or multi prescriptions, i.e. using it together
      with other medicines resulted in even better effects because
      Kumdang -2 is not antagonistic to, but is synergic with other
      medicines and prevents or removes the side effects of the other
      medicines. In comparison with other medicines Kumdang-2 Injection
      was far better not only in improving the test values as described
      above, but also in alleviating or removing such symptoms of
      hepatitis as indigestion, stomach flatulence, loss of strength,
      and bad colours of face, urine and stool. In most of the chronic
      hepatitis cases, too, the patients speedily reached complete cure
      upon use of this injection as per the Administration above, and
      neither of them has been converted to liver cirrhosis and/or
      ascites. Treatments of liver cirrhosis and ascites also resulted
      in good records. This injection restored and proliferated liver
      cells at a great rate, optimized the immunity system and the
      ability of automatic regulation, and thus completely cured the
      liver cirrhosis. In most of the liver ascites cases, too, the
      dropsy drained soon resulting in a high rate of recovery.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Tuberculosis</i><i><br>
      </i><br>
      There are enough anti-?? drugs widely known in the world. In
      particular, Isoniazid, Rifampicin, Pyrazinamide and Ethambutol are
      in wide use in the scope of DOTS, an anti-?? strategy adopted by
      WHO in 1990, which has been of great significance in the worldwide
      campaign against ??. But most of them damage the liver, kidney and
      nervous system, and cause indigestion, optic and acoustic
      disturbances, bladder and pancreatic disorders, as well as nausea,
      fever and headache. Administration of Kumdang-2 Injection combined
      with those medicines enhanced the latter’s efficaciousness, ?
      improved the general conditions of the body and raised the
      complete recovery rate without side effects and mortality. There
      are also a large number of ?? cases which have been completely
      cured on single prescription of Kumdang-2 Injection only.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Uterine and other intestinal hemorrhages</i><i><br>
      </i><br>
      Single or combined administration of Kumdang-2 Injection
      completely stopped uterine hemorrhages caused by menstrual
      disorder, follicular hormone deficiency due to liver diseases,
      uterine myoma and postpartum atonicity; prevented their
      recurrences; and improved the physical conditions of the patients.
      Besides, it had marvelous effects on habitual nose-bleed and
      various hemorrhages e.g. the ones caused by ulcerative colitis and
      serious cystitis. In heavy cases of anaemia (lack of blood) caused
      by serious hemorrhages, Kumdang-2 Injection swiftly replenished
      the red blood corpuscles and platelets, and thus, markedly
      hastened complete recoveries from anaemia.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Various cancers</i><i><br>
      </i><br>
      Some cells carry cancer genes. These cells do not grow owing to
      the action of the immuno-competence, but. once they undergo a
      support from outside by inducers (e.g. longtime repeated stimulus
      on the same spot cancer-generating (carcinogenic) substances and
      viruses), they would grow without restriction. This is cancer.
      Therefore, if the body has a strong immunity, the cancer would not
      outbreak and, even if outbroken, the cancer cells would be removed
      or&nbsp; suppressed subject that the immuno-competence is well
      adjusted. We are in the knowledge that 200 healthy cells are
      mobilized to kill one cancer cell, so the proliferation of healthy
      cells can suppress cancer. Kumdang-2 Injection optimized the
      immuno-competence and revived and proliferated healthy cells, and
      thereby achieved high records in preventing and curing all sorts
      of cancer. In treatments of cancers by this injection, the rate of
      recovery was very high in their initial stage, rather high in the
      middle stage, and low in the terminal stage. According to the
      clinic records of the cancer cases fully cured or suppressed by
      this injection, all the recorded patients frequently applied the
      “maximum dose” described above and more than 300-600 ampoules were
      used in total. When this injection was dispensed in combination
      with the anti-cancer medicines including Endoxan, 5-Fluorouracil,
      Mitomycin, Vincristin. Cisplatin and Taxol, thesevere adverse side
      effects thereof were alleviated considerably and high therapeutic
      results were achieved. According to the clinical records, this
      injection has particularly good effects in cures of cancers of:
      liver, stomach, gall, bile duct, pancreas, prostate gland, breast,
      uterus and adnexa of uterus and the mucus tumor of peritoneum. The
      high clinical records of this injection in cures of cancers once
      again proved the world wide insistence that cancer can be cured by
      optimization of immunity on use of immune activators such as the
      immune adjusting polysaccharide activated by light rare earths and
      platinum (e.g. Kumdang-2 Injection). According to the clinical
      records, the death rate was high among the patients who had taken
      only the anti-cancer medicines. But the survival rate was high
      among those who had taken the anti-cancer medicines together with
      this injection or only this injection.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Venereal diseases, Resistance to aging</i><i><br>
      </i><br>
      According to reports from foreign sources, Kumdang-2 Injection was
      successful in combating a variety of venereal diseases. They say
      many people have become immune to these diseases upon injection of
      Kumdang-2. Resistance to aging Kumdang-2 Injection enjoyed great
      reputation among the elderly. Aging was resisted considerably, and
      wrinkles, stooping, debility, awkward movements, loss of sexual
      desire and memory, and disorders of thinking and speech were all
      alleviated considerably. In the medical checkup, the Kumdang-2
      injected elders aged 70-80 appeared to be only 45-55 years old in
      all the health indices. Kumdang-2 Injection has proved to be tonic
      to healthy people as well. It was reported that upon injection
      they felt invigorated, became less tired after work, and grew
      immune to the diseases mentioned above. It had good effects on the
      healthy people, who had felt mental or physical fatigue,
      especially after hard work, much exercise and heavy drinking, or
      when they had to stay awake over-night, and when cold and other
      epidemic diseases prevailed.<br>

      </b><b>Administration</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The “Basic Administration” of Kumdang-2 Injection is: simply on
      the first day, apply 1-2 ampoules; and from the second day,
      depending on the patient’s response, increase every day its
      each-time dose by one ampoule, getting them 1-2 times daily, with
      an interval of 1-2 days on every fifth day; after about 10 days
      (including the days of interval) get 7-8 ampoules each time, 2-3
      times daily, for 2-3 days; then suspend the injection; and later
      depending on the developments of cure, resume the injection. This
      method is oriented from the mechanism of applying a “heavy strike”
      upon the disease after the patient’s body is acclimatized to this
      injection In cases of emergency, by injecting it every 4-6 hours,
      5-8 ampoules each time we could save many dying patients. If the
      patients with no critical severity got from the first day as many
      as 6-8 ampoules each time, they might experience overburden at the
      heart, indigestion and other heavy healing responses, while
      getting little effects on the treatment. On the other hand,
      injection of only 1-2 ampoules everyday for a very long period
      would result in waste of the medicine and failure to obtain
      desired effects. Therefore, it is advisable to follow the above
      “Basic Administration”.<br>

      This table is only an exemplary recommendation and is not
      compulsory to follow up. As explained so far, getting 1 -8
      ampoules each time, 1 -3 times a day intramuscularly (IM) and/or
      intravenously (IV), with an interval of 1-2 days on every fifth
      day would be enough. The efficacies of IM and IV are almost the
      same, but according to the hitherto clinical records IM has been
      more effective than IV. It is advisable to get IM for a while and
      then IV because IM might harden the injected part of hip. You
      should vigorously massage the injected part for 5-7 minutes. Once
      the injected part is hardened due to repeated injections and lazy
      massage, place an alcohol-wet pad on the part and vigorously
      massage it longer time or use a massage vibrator. Then the part
      shall be softened again as before. The best way of administration
      is to find out the optimal dosage suited to your constitution and
      disease through your personal experience. * Inject one ampoule on
      the first day and 1 -2 ampoules next day, and then you can decide
      on the further dosages according to your physical response.<br>
      <br>
      (1) After injections for 2 days as above, if you feel strong,
      refreshed and happy to a satisfactory extent and the former
      symptoms are alleviated remarkably (e.g. remarkable alleviation of
      pain, improvement of face complexion and good digestion), you
      should continue with 3 ampoules in a dose, once daily, for 3 days.
      Thereafter, if you feel complete recovery, you may stop the
      injection. If you do not feel that your disease has been cured,
      you should get the injection for another 4 days before
      discontinuing it for a couple of days. Then, you should follow the
      “Basic Administration”. This will enable almost ail patients to
      reach complete cure. In case of recurrence after a certain period,
      you may either repeat the first and second courses in the above
      table, or administer 5 ampoules in a dose, I -3 times daily,
      whenever felt necessary.<br>
      <br>
      (2) During the two days’ injection as above, some patients may
      feel that their diseased parts are stimulated to a small extent.
      For example, those with a heart disease or weak heart may feel
      slight throbbing or stifled in their heart and those with
      hepatitis may feel irritated a little in their liver and the
      wounded may feel small pain in their wounds. But healthy parts of
      body may not be felt irritated in any case. Someone might complain
      of throbbing at the heart although he has not any heart disease.
      But the reality would be the other way round: he did know his
      heart had fallen sick. The irritation of the diseased part, being
      a healing response, serves as an indication of rapid healing of
      your disease. Such temporary irritation will disappear in a few
      days. If you feel as above after the 2 days’ injection, you are
      recommended to get 1 -2 ampoules in a dose, once daily, for 2 more
      days, which is followed by an interval of 2 days. After that get 2
      ampoules in one time on the day, and from the subsequent day get
      the injection once a day increasing the each time dose by 1
      ampoule with each passing day for 6-7 days. This will result in
      great efficaciousness. In the event you had failed to reach
      complete cure thereat, you would first take an interval of 2-5
      days, and resume the injection thereafter. From then on, you would
      get 5-6 ampoules in a dose. Volume and frequency would depend on
      your physical condition. Get the injection 2-3 times daily if you
      are in a critical condition and once daily if not.<br>
      <br>
      (3) After injection of I -2 ampoules in a dose, once daily, for 1
      -2 days, very few patients (less than 0.001 % of the total) felt
      heavily stimulated at the diseased parts and/or experienced
      throbbing or stifled feelings at the heart. Such feelings were
      found especially among feeble girls and weak elders. They are not
      side effects, but signs of healing response. Therefore, you should
      not worry about them. The patient should be convinced that it is a
      favourable condition because in that case he or she could reach
      complete cure faster than others if the daily dosage is properly
      controlled. In such a case, have a break for 1-2 days first and
      then inject 1 ampoule daily or every other day for 5-6 days. This
      will make your body accustomed to this injection, no longer making
      you feel such symptoms. From then on, you would continue with the
      administration increasing your dose until you regain your health
      according to Table-1 “Category 1: For common cases.”<br>
      <br>
      (4) In case you feel good mood and small healing response and no
      other changes in your body after the 2 days’ injection, follow
      Table-1.<br>
      <br>
      (5) In case you feel no slightest change at all in your mood and
      body after the 2 days’ injection, first continue the First Course
      in Table-1. In case you still feel nothing thereafter, you should
      jump over the Second Course to the Third Course. If you had begun
      the First Course of “Category 1,” you would apply the Second and
      Third Courses of “Category 2” and then repeat the Third Course.
      During the injection some patients may experience drowsiness,
      indigestion or stronger sickness. All these symptoms are parts of
      healing response, and they all will disappear 2-3 days later. As
      seen above, it is advisable to get this injection by increasing
      every day the each time dose by 1 ampoule. Should you feel no
      satisfactory progress of cure even after the Third Course of
      Table-1, you would discontinue it and take a break for 2-4 days
      and then inject 6-8 ampoules in a dose, 2-3 times daily, for 3-5
      days, whereupon no failure of satisfactory cure has been recorded
      so far. There are a large number of cases, which had failed to
      respond to other medicines, but reached complete cures upon this
      injection. In a word, the efficaciousness of this injection does
      not depend on the total quantity injected, but largely depends on
      whether the volumes and frequencies of injection are correctly
      adopted depending on the patient’s condition and his particular
      disease.<br>
      <br>
      (6) We can imagine some cases where, even though followed (5)
      above, nothing felt and nothing happened (although such cases
      almost never happened): If you had not felt any distinctive
      improvements after 7-15 days of injection, it could be explained
      that your condition were far better than those who could not apply
      maximum dose because the diseased parts were felt too much
      painful. In that case, your condition would serve as an evident
      sign that by freely applying maximum doses you would easily reach
      complete cure. Administration of maximum dose is as follows:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1st&nbsp; day: 5 ampoules x 2 times<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2nd day: 5 ampoules x 3 times<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3rd day: 6 ampoules x 3 times<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4th day: 7 ampoules x 3 times<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5th day:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Break<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6th day: 7 ampoules x 3 times<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7th day: 8 ampoules x 3 times<br>
      <br>
      * In severe cases of high fever, malignant influenza, epidemic
      diseases, etc., injecting 5-7 ampoules each time, for 3-4 times
      continuously with an interval of only 5-10 minutes between
      injections mostly resulted in instant lull recovery.<br>

      <i>Notes</i><i><br>
      </i><br>
      1)&nbsp; This being a herbal medicine, it can be administered
      without punctuality in disregard of the timetable exhibited in the
      enclosure of its packet. According to the hitherto clinical
      records, the rate of recovery was higher among its random users
      than its punctual users.<br>
      <br>
      2) All the patients with clear knowledge of the principles of its
      dosage have experienced satisfactory effects and 95.5% of them
      resulted in complete cure.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Contraindications kumdang-2 injection</i><i><br>
      </i><br>
      No contraindications have been reported. In the period of
      administration, you need not refrain from drinking or become too
      sensitive to foods. As no medicines antagonistic to Kumdang-2
      Injection have so far been found, you may use Kumdang-2 Injection
      with any other medicines depending on your conditions.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Adverse Effects</i><i><br>
      </i><br>
      No adverse side effects have been found so far.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Precautions</i><i><br>
      </i><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) Kumdang-2 Injection is synergic with other
      medicines. Therefore, simultaneous use with other medicines would
      result in better effects, in which case Kumdang-2 should be
      injected by a separate syringe with exception of cocarboxylase and
      vitamin ?1, which can be mixed with Kumdang-2 in the same syringe.
      Dilution of Kumdang-2 Injection in such dropper solutions as
      dextrose (glucose) and Ringer’s solution is not encouragible as it
      may not help to maximize its effects because its micro-elements
      having been already largely diluted in it, their excessive
      dilution may cause decrease of their medicinal effects. Therefore,
      separate IM or IV injection of Kumdang-2 before or after dropping
      (instillation of) other solutions is advisable. It is important to
      keep the principle of getting 1-2 ampoules on the first day and
      increasing the volume of injection from the next day as described
      above. For 20-28 days you may continue the injection with a break
      of 1-2 days after each 4 days. Once the 20-28 days’ course is
      completed, you may have an interval of 3-7 days. Then in
      accordance with your resultant condition you may either
      discontinue the injection for good or begin a few course. Such
      in-course intervals are aimed at fully discharging the rare-earth
      elements after their medicinal actions properly done, thus
      avoiding their in-body accumulations. When resuming another course
      after a short or long time, you would start with 5 or more
      ampoules as each time dose. At this stage, continuous everyday
      injection is advisable, but it is more advisable to get injections
      only when you feel like doing it or feel unwell in the range of
      5-8 ampoules each time and 1-3 times a day.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Excess of the above
      said “maximum dosage” is unadvisable.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some patients
      complained that although they had enjoyed good effects during the
      course of injections, upon stop thereof the good effects
      disappeared. But, later they felt improvements again without
      resuming dosage. There were some cases that the results had not
      been so much satisfactory after the first course only, but they
      were fully satisfied after the second or the third course.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For some 30 days
      after full recovery, you should refrain from some overburdens,
      e.g. excessive drinking, too much exercise and hard labour because
      although you would feel invigorated and pleasant from your
      recovery, your physical conditions are still in a feeble state
      like a flower in a green house. After the said 30days your
      physical conditions will return to the original state, so no
      particular cautions are recommended from then on. There were some
      patients who, feeling pleasant and strong after recovery from
      illness by help of Kumdang-2 Injection, had ignored the
      convalescence period of 30 days and during that period drank
      excessively and overworked, thereby falling ill again. Once the
      disease relapsed like that you would take longer courses of
      injection of Kumdang-2, consuming far more ampoules.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon injection
      (mostly IV) of any medicines including Kumdang-2 Injection, very
      few patients might suffer from temporary fever and chill.
      According to the hitherto evidences, such fever and chill have not
      been caused by the injected medicines, but were caused by some
      pyrogen (generator of fever) formed in the single-use-syringes
      owing to their improper handling or improper result of their
      in-process automatic sterilization. In such a case, you should
      first discontinue the injection and stop the lever and chill by 2
      tablets of aspirin (If the patient does not respond to aspirin,
      inject camphor and dimedrolum along with intakes of aspirin.).
      Then, using a syringe of another brand, inject (IM) 1 ampoule (or
      half an ampoule) of Kumdang-2 once in 2 days, whereupon you may
      start carefully increasing the daily dosage. Thereupon, you will
      experience far better effects than the patients devoid of such
      negative response.&nbsp; <br>

      simply can not meet ginseng nutritional needs, because most
      farmers grow ginseng law and nutritional needs and so poorly
      understood, in addition to the fertilizer and the lack of certain
      nutrients, can easily result in ginseng production is low, the
      leaves wither and fall off, and less flowering results little,
      tiny roots of underdevelopment, slow growth, more lead to various
      pests and diseases.<br>
      According to the research, in the growing period of ginseng moist
      environment requires long-term, therefore, an urgent need for a
