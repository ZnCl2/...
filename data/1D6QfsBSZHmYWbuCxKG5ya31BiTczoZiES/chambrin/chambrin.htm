      <p>Jean Chambrin, a mechanical engineer in Paris, developed a
        water-and-alcohol motor, which he used to run his own private
        cars on denatured alcohol and water. The inventor claimed that
        his motor's design could be mass-produced at a fraction of the
        cost of present engines. He received nothing but publicity ---
        of the type that forced him to take great precautions in regard

      <p><b>Abstract</b> ---&nbsp; Reactor to use water and carburants
        mixture as fuel which can be adjusted to a thermal engine (3) or
        heating equipment, making possible the feeding of the engine (3)
        or heating source with hydrogen. The reactor (1) consists of a
        central region with two feeding points supplied with exhaust
        gases that circulate throughout the pipes. A mixture of water
        and any carburant, at any proportion, is injected in the
        pre-heated central region through spiral tubes or by integrated
        electric resistors. This mixture is suddenly decompounded
        electromagnetic effect in the central region and goes into the
        inlet manifold of the engine through a conduit. The feeding is
        performed with a modified carburetor by means of an exhaust
        manifold central region connection amplified with a connection
        between the exhaust manifold (5) and the less hot zone and added
        to that a thermal protection that fully involves it.; It can
        equip all kind of internal combustion engines as well as all
        heat-producing apparatus. </p>
      <p><b>Description</b> </p>
      <p>An apparatus which permits the conditioning of the water and
        carburants mixture, limited to pure water, casuing an
        electromagnetic reaction capable of producing hydrogen and a
        plasmatic state of matter, to be used in engines and heating
        systems. </p>
      <p>It concerns the use of electromagnetic energy obtained
        primarily from a combustible and then from water and combustible
        mixture and, finally, from pure water, under the form of
        thermomagnetic energy (burners, boilers, etc.) or propelling
        energy (internal-combustion engine or reaction engine). </p>
      <p>The decomposition of the water into its basic elements (oxygen
        and hydrogen) is feasible, either by electrolytic or
        electromagnetic processes. Both processes demand a considerable
        quantity of electrolytic or electromagnetic energy, stored
        oxygen and hydrogen, carriage of these elements and their
        delayed application. </p>
      <p>The Reactor, as it is suggested to be used, is not subject to
        such inconveniences since electromagnetic decomposition of the
        water can be quickly and directly obtained, as far as it is
        used. The necessary and indispensable calorific energy to the
        internal electromagnetic reaction is ensured within the cycle
        confined to the right application which eliminates the
        discriminating inconveniences and risks inherent to the usual
        processes. </p>
      <p>Another advantage of the conceived process is to produce energy
        in a much more economical way. </p>
      <p>The described reactor converts the mixture before its
        introduction in the inlet manifold of the engine. This mixture
        consists of water and carburants (gasoline, diesel, alcohol,
        ammonia, etc.) limited to pure water, in view of its use in an
        engine or heating system. </p>
      <p>Known in France as the "Chambrin Device", patent number
        75/06619, the Reactor, in face of the advanced researches
        carried out in Brazil, enables us to put into practice the
        thermonuclear plasma theory improving its efficiency and
        economical operation. The referred theory is based on another
        mechanical principle of motion that is electromagnetism. A gas
        is elastic. If it is highly warmed up, it turns into a plasma
        which is inwardly stirred, consequently producing an electric
        current which when readjusted produces nascent hydrogen. </p>
      <p>Although in France the Chambrin Device has also produced
        hydrogen, it was not achieved with the efficiency of the present
        invention. </p>
      <p>The efficiency achieved is due to an increased rotation speed
        of the gases inside this Reactor (Figs 1, 2, 3-1, 4 longitudinal
        section and 6 cross sections) providing a better use of the
        power and output of the engine (Figs. 1, 2, 3-3) which obtained
        by connecting (Fig 3-9) the exhaust manifold of the engine (9)
        to the outlet of the Reactor (Figs 3-10). </p>
      <p>In view of the formal explantion of the energy-generating
        process and the results achieved with the several experiments,
        it may be confirmed that this apparatus is a "Reactor to Use
        Water and Carburants Mixture as a Fuel". </p>
      <p>The Reactor (1) is placed between the carburetor (2), already
        modified, and the engine block (3), so that it is well
        integrated to the engine itself (Fig. 1 - front view of the
        assemblage). </p>
      <p>The experiments carried out up till now, with various models,
        show that, under certain operating conditions, the observed
        temperatures were the following (Fig 2): around 800 C at the
        exit of the exhaust manifold (7), around 500 C at the outlet of
        the Reactor (6), around 300 C at the end of the outlet tube,
        leading out the burnt gases (8), which is 2 meters long. </p>
      <p>The inlet manifold (Figs 1-4) and the exhaust pipes of the
        engine (5) lead the gases to high temperatures; it also happens
        to the new connection (Fig 3-9 to 10). </p>
      <p>The Reactor which could be considered, even before the
        connection, a unique one, regarding the ongoing advanced
        researches and experiments, became still more efficient.
        Furthermore, the reactor can be built in other geometric shapes
        and operate according to the same principle. </p>
      <p>The basic operating principle of the Reactor may be described
        as follws: </p>
      <p>The direction of the gases course (Fig 4) is indicated from the
        Very Hot Zone (11) close to the exhaust manifold. The region
        next to the external walls is denominated Less hot Zone (12).
        The difference in temperature between these two zones is around
        400 C, under conditions in which the experiments were performed.
        The cold, pulverized and diffused mixture along the tube (Fig
        4-13 to 14) that ends at the Less Hot Zone warms up
        progressively in rotating movements (Figs 5 and 6 - cross
        sections) when in contact with the walls of the peripheral
        covering before going into the Central Region (Fig 4-11). At
        this point, it achieves a maximum temperature soon after its
        admission in the inlet manifold of the engine, through a conduit
        situated in the Very Hot Zone, communicating the central region
        with teh engine, taking the shortest path (Fig 4-1). </p>
      <p>Therefore, from a necessary Thermal Cap, the very hot portion
        of the central region is the basis of a Thermoelectric
        Decomposition of the admitted mixture. Such condition is
        essential for its use as an energetic agent of the engine. The
        new collector (Fig 3-9 and 10) speeds up the process providing a
        more profitable use of the power and output of the engine. </p>
      <p>All collectors (Fig 3-4, 5, 6, and 9 and 10) must be properly
        protected from external temperatures. </p>
      <p>The engine used, irrespective of its origin, needs no specific
        alterations, but must have a compressure rate around 15 50 20
        and the inlet and exhaust pipes must allow the assembly of the
        Reactor. It is also desireable that the ingine be endowed with a
        multiple sparking system and spark plugs with high electrical
        shock potential, with rotating capability. The carburetor used
        is a classical one, however, the float, the primary air inlet
        diffuser and the jet must be accurately adjusted, as the
        admitted mixture may change during operation. When cold, the
        Reactor is fed with a classical fuel (gasoline or alcohol, for
        instance). Once the engine reaches its crossing temperature, the
        injected fuel carries progressively, or spontaneously, a
        compound mixture, in weight or volume, of a more and more
        reduced quantity of alcohol and up to the limit of pure water.
        Therefore, the physico-chemical nature of the mixture may vary
        during operation and, consequently, its specific weight. This
        makes possible, at any time, to adjust the combustion system
        according to the admitted mixture. </p>
      <p>It was remarkably proved, during the accomplished experiments,
        that the admitted quantity of primary air could be reduced as
        far as the quantity of water contained in the mixture increased.
        It demonstrates that a developed carburetor must act in response
        to the different variability criteria, either by manual or
        automatic means, or both together. The vehicles will have to
        have two tanks. A small one for the pure fuel and a normal one
        of the mixture that contains water. The feeding by electric
        pumps, the constant pressure and the variable consumption put
        together are the best way of feeding.&nbsp; The direct injection
        must be effected at the admission level, inside the Reactor, and
        not at the combustion chambers level. It is necessary to have at
        least two pumps. One adjusted to prime combustible (such as
        alcohol) and the other to the mixture or pure water. The
        adjustment may be performed using a double-acting cock which
        either closes the mixture, or pure water, inlet or opens it. </p>
      <p>In view of the high temperatures registered inside the reactor
        (Fig 4-11) and to ensure its good mechanical performance, it
        consists of a thick crown wheel, made of a material of high
        thermal conductivity. The pipes in which the consumed gases
        circulate are laid across the crown wheel from side to side. </p>
      <p>The admission of the mixture in the central region is effected
        in the less hot zone (Fig 4-12) through calibrated holes where
        the sum of their sections corresponds to the section of the
        passageways. These holes are arranged in order to facilitate the
        course of the fluid. </p>
      <p>The pipes provide passageways such that the sum of their
        diameters corresponds, at all points, to the diameter of the
        passageway leading out the burnet gases. There are 7 pipes, one
        central and 6 peripheral (Figs 5 and 6). The non-channelled
        parts are used as pre-heating tubes. Such arrangement provides a
        well-fixed mechanical assembly. </p>
      <p>The direction of the mixture must necessarily be the same as
        the engine's rotation to avoid that opposing magnetic fields
        restrain the mixture's course from its spinning movement. </p>
      <p>The outside is conceived in order to fit the inlet manifold,
        leading to the carburetor (Fig 1-2 front view), in the section
        of the passageway, turning from a usually circular section into
        a similar lengthened rectangular section. </p>
      <p>For manufacturing reasons and easy assembly, the central region
        consists of two different parts: one, covered, has in its end,
        next to the very hot zone (Fig 4-13), an external screw thread
        to receive the adjoining part; the other, regardless of the
        precedent, is screwed to that last part. It is not externally
        covered but is endowed with an outlet pipe favourably directly
        to enable its connection with the inlet pipe of the engine. The
        new conductor that joins the exhaust pipe of the engine to the
        less hot zone of the Reactor may be attached by different means:
        welded or screwed. </p>
      <p>To avoid thermal losses at both admission and exhaust external
        joint levels as well as on the periphery of the apparatus and
        the graduation of the prevailing residual temperatures at the
        outlet of the Reactor (around 500 C), it has a Thermal Shield
        which involving the assemblage can, on one hand, reheats the
        external walls of the Reactor and, on the other hand, isolates
        from outside all elements subjected to high temperatures. </p>
      <p>The new manifold (Fig 3-9 to 10) consists of a connection with
        this shield from the exhaust pipe (Fig 3-9 in 7) to the less hot
        zone of the Reactor (Fig 3-10 and Fig 4 - longitudinal section -
        10). </p>
      <p>The thermal shield consists of two metallic walls in red copper
        separated from each other by a thermal insulator -- amianthus or
        any like product -- of sufficient thickness so that the external
        wall would be more or less warm. A deflector is placed to
        provide a well distribution of the gases that strike against the
        thermal shield. It must be considered a way of ionizing the
        admitted mixture of the engine block is isolated from the sun,
        which can be performed using an electronic oscillator. </p>
      <p>Finally, the accomplished researches and the achieved results
        proved that the feeding of the Reactor here presented is the
        most efficient, although further studies may lead to other
        improvements. </p>

      <p><b>Abstract</b> --&nbsp; A reactor to transmute the matter
        which using any fuel in its solid, liquid or gaseous state,
        associated to dihydrogen oxide, can set into motion (5) engines,
        turbines, boilers, heaters, etc., due to its capacity of
        transmuting such carburants. It is a cylindric apparatus (2),
        containing two or more longitudinal tubes with barriers (9 and
        10) against which the molecules strike at a considerable speed
        causing a transformation in the primary fuel. It must keep the
        exhaust gases under a constant pressure to extend and speed up
        the reaction. It must be built of a metallic material with high
        thermal conductivity due to the high temperatures registered
        during the process. It can be coupled to any internal combustion
        engine or to all equipment that generates driving power. </p>
      <p><b>Description</b> </p>
      <p>An apparatus that enables the running of any engine, turbine,
        boiler, heater, etc., regardless of the fuel used, due to its
        capacity of transmuting such carburants, once they contain
        dihydrogen oxide or are associated to it, into a new fuel. </p>
      <p>To start the transmutation process it is only necessary to
        reach the adequate temperature for the process, or respective of
        the fuel used --- gasoline, ammonia, kerosene, ethyl or methyl
        alcohol, or any carburant available (either in solid, liquid or
        gaseous state) -- combined with a hydric element. Contrary to
        what one might imagine, this temperature does not reach
        extraordinary levels since, in this case, it is only one of the
        necessary elements to the accomplishment of the phenomenon. The
        assembly of the Reactor itself is the main condition to its
        functioning. </p>
      <p>Once we have the necessary conditions to set in process, the
        Reactor can even be fed only with water. Although the phenomenon
        proved satisfactory, also, in this case, the use of other
        carburants, mainly the alcohols, even though in minimal
        proportions (5% to 95% of water), is also important. It was
        verified that the carburants which are firstly used to start the
        process can also stabilize the transmutation, as the proportion
        of dihydrogen increases, keeping it withing the limits of
        necessary safety. </p>
      <p>A formal explanation of the said process, considering the use
        of the Reactor, may be given by its capacity of producing
        hydrogen at relatively low temperatures with the support of the
        exhaust gases of the engine to which it is attached, and the
        hydrogen transmutation into other gases, with occasional and
        consecutive changes of the elements, causing an electromagnetic
        reaction of the physical field, by an elastic compresison of
        these gases. Since a starting mechanism of the process is
        determined, the calories wasted to set the engine into motion,
        which can be either conventional, gasoline or diesel consuming,
        or boilers, turbines, etc., are also used to produce a fuel
        which will be reused. </p>
      <p>Hence, one can say the Reactor is an aparatus to produce
        calories. For example, if 2000 KCal (kilo/calories) is
        introduced in the Reactor it will be possible to multiply these
        calories by 100, 1000, and even 100,000 according to what it is
        chosen to be used. The only condition to have a progressive
        multiplication of the calories without problems is to provide a
        cooling apparatus like the one used in combustion engines during
        operation. </p>
      <p>Another aspect of the process accomplished with the Reactor is
        the necessary obtention of the molecules strike, as intensive as
        possible. The bigger in intensity and molecules the strike is,
        more calories will be produced and consequently more
        potentiality it will have. </p>
      <p>The Reactor (Fig 1-2), which is installed, in case of engines,
        between the carburetor (Fig 1-1), already modified, and the
        engine block, processes the fuels, or the water, before their
        admission in the engine (Fig 1-3). </p>
      <p>The outer side of the Reactor must be conceived tio receive the
        gases inlet to the engine (Fig 1-3_, the exhaust gases outlet of
        the engine (Fig 1-5_, which has a ball to decompress the gases
        (Fig 1-5), and the feed back pipe (Fig 1-6). </p>
      <p>After many experiments and considering the velocity of the
        molecules, the Reactor has a cylindrical shape (Fig 1-2 and 2 -
        longitudinal section) with two or more tubes inside (Fig 2-7)
        according to its use. These tubes are placed leaving 5 to 10 mm
        between each other, such variation depending on the dimensions
        of the engine or apparatus to which the Reactor is attached. The
        width of the Ractor will also be determined according to the
        type of engine or apparatus employed. </p>
      <p>The builder of the Reactor must consider in his calculation
        mainly the production of hydrogen and of the several other gases
        that feed the engine, etc. </p>
      <p>The invention of the Reactor has a cylindrical shape because it
        helps to speed up the velocity of the molecules. A shock barrier
        is placed longitudinally (Fig 3 - cross section - 9 and 10) to
        multiply the fractioning of the molecules, intensifying
        therefore the calories producing process. On the other hand, it
        is also necessary to have a constant pressure of the exhaust
        gases next to the Reactor (Fig 1-6) since in case of reducing
        the gases flux at the outlet of the engine will become less
        powerful. So, it is interesting to involve the Reactor with an
        obconical covering (Fig 2-8) which maintains the gases balance
        and to insert a compressure ball of the gases at the outlet of
        the exhaust pipe or the original engine (Fig 1-4 and 2-4). With
        this system it is possible to obtain a constant pressure of the
        gases without braking the engine. </p>
      <p>The Reactor must be endowed with a thick metallic covering,
        considering the high internal temperatures registered, made of a
        material with high thermal conductivity. Also the manifolds that
        go across this covering (Fig 2-7) must be made of a material
        with a good thermal conductivity. Although various types of
        metals present such required qualities, the different types of
        copper, in some cases even an alloy of bronze and brass, proved
        to better meet the demands of the Reactor and to be more
        economic for construction. </p>
      <p>The results achieved with the Reactor are of great importance.
        using a mixture of water and ethyl alcohol, equally proportioned
        in weight, as fuel to feed the Reactor, it was identified at the
        outlet of the Reactor (before its admission in the engine) 33
        different gases, such as: Argon, Aluminum, Cobalt, Molybdenum,
        Technetium, Ruthenium, Rhodium, Palladium, Lanthanum, Thulium,
        Astatine, Americium and Curium. In addition, at the outlet of
        the exhaust pipe it was observed 46 different gases. Among these
        gases were registered: Hydrogen, Helium, Lithium, Beryllium,
        Aluminum, Chlorine, Technetium, Ruthenium, Rhodium, Barium,
        Lanthanum, Polonium, Protactinium, Americium, Curium, Berkelium
        and Hahnium. Three other gases which are in the group could not
        be identified according to the Periodic Chart of the Elements;
        their numbers are 109, 111 and 131. It is interesting to
        remember that the Periodic Chart of the Elements classifies only
        up to Element 105. </p>
      <p>Another innovation of the Reacor is the feasibility of storing
        the exhaust gases and to send them back under a given pressure
        to the Reactor, acting in this way as a compressor pipe. If this
        method is applied, it will ahve to be injected, for safety's
        sake, with an electronic injector or any other system, a minimum
        quantity of alcohol or any other fuel at each revolution of the
        engine. With this system, it became possible to reduce
        substantially the consumption of carburants. It will require
        only one liter of alcohol or any other fuel to cover 60 km (37
        miles). or even set a stationary engine into motion with one
        liter of fuel, at 1800 rpm, during an hour. </p>
      <p>The Reactor can also equip a boiler which has instead of an
        exhaust pipe a tube that goes into the heated center of the
        boiler and is attached to each end of the Reactor. In this case,
        the tube is filled with a enutral gas under a given pressure.
        Thus, the neutral gas will float throughout the tube, acting
        like the exhaust gases. To achieve such results. it will only be
        necessary to couple a double acting pump to aspirate the fuel by
        pushing it into the Reactor and, at the same time, to impel it
        under pressure to the injector where it will be consumed. For
        its extraordinary capacity of being fed with any kind of fuel
        and ejecting to the engine, the most diverse group of gases, the
        referred apapratus was denominated Reactor to Transmute Matter.
