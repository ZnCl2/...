      Regarding pathology of Traditional Chinese Medicine, the
      coordination of vital essence, qi, and mind is treated as the main
      guiding principle, especially in the respect of qi (so-called
      energy for the western natural medical scholars). When applying
      drug or non-drug therapy to the human body dysfunction, qi is
      attributed to be the effect. Thanks for the help of western
      science that the so-called qi can be measured with instrument by a
      lot of scholars doing research on qi. A portion of qi relatively
      close to material (there is also a portion relatively close to
      spirit) is composed of several kinds of micro-energy (Infrared,
      negative ion current, magnetic wave, etc.), which makes using
      instrument of qi can be a possible hope for treating illness.
      There are already so-called Qigong machine in the market; however,
      the treating mechanism and the application scope thereof are still
      quite limited. Inspired by chance, this inventor finds a more
      complete theory regarding this aspect, and manufactures an
      instrument, electrostatic current treatment instrument which
      really can use qi to treat illness, to share with everyone.<br>
