            give adrenaline sports a push</b><br>
        </big></div>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>By C.C. Weiss</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Motor power can make already crazy, awesome adrenaline sports even
      crazier and … awesomer. Just look at designs like the Gnarboard
      and Jetboard. Unfortunately, filling a garage with various forms
      of motorized gear could quickly bankrupt a professional sports
      star. If an experimental thrusting system from UK-based
      Dreamscience Propulsion makes it to market, it could save some of
      those dollars by rolling the fun of several types of motorized
      boards into one device. The electric propulsion system lends
      motor-muscle to skiing, surfing, paragliding and beyond.<br>
      <br>
      Good things happen when Ph.Ds get into action sports. After trying
      his hand at paramotoring, one such Ph.D, Dreamscience's founder
      and director Adam Contoret, decided he didn't like the experience
      of strapping a big, coughing engine on his back, so he started to
      tinker around with his own thrust system.<br>
      <br>
      "The thruster is a very powerful motor driving a fan, about 30,000
      rpm," Contoret explains. "A modern jet engine has a turbojet
      propulser module at the core of the engine and this drives a large
      fan at the front of the engine that generates most of the thrust.
      Electric motor technology has recently progressed to the level
      where the turbojet core can be replaced with a high power electric
      motor. A turbojet core generates massive amounts of heat, so an
      advantage of a motor core is the cool exhaust air stream making
      extreme sports applications possible without the danger of getting
      burned."<br>
      <br>
      <b>Paragliding test</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Dreamscience has gone through several different prototype designs
      using the thruster modules that Contoret describes. The latest
      prototype uses a foursome of 8-kW motor-powered thrusters to spin
      out 100+ lb (445+ N) of thrust. With the design still under
      development, Dreamscience hasn't put out a full spec sheet, but we
      do know that it uses a mix of carbon fiber fans and an aluminum
      frame, with a lithium-polymer battery pack powering the motors.<br>
      <br>
      "Four [motors] draw about 700 amps at 55 volts on full tap,"
      Contoret says. "That's a shed-load of power considering an average
      household draws 60 amps. The only way to get that kind of power is
      using the latest lithium polymer batteries, which have come on
      leaps and bounds in the past five years."<br>
      <br>
      The Dreamscience thruster is envisioned as a sports power unit for
      surfing, skating, snow ...<br>
      <br>
      While the original motivator was paragliding, Contoret quickly
      realized that the system could also be used for other sports,
      including skiing, land boarding and surfing. It straps into the
      same type of harness used for power kites in sport derivatives
      like kitesurfing. The rider holds onto the central bar, controls
      thrust with either a thumb throttle or bite control (the latter
      allows for better grip), and steers the direction of the thrust as
      needed with their arms.<br>
      <br>
      "The thrusters pretty much swap in to wherever you would use a
      power kite," Contoret says.<br>
      <br>
      Unlike those kites, the thruster system provides instant power,
      without the need to rely on factors like wind and weather. It
      currently offers a brief five minutes of run time, but Contoret
      and crew are working to increase that.<br>
      <br>
      Contoret imagines that the thrusters will also find use in
      increasing jump height and pushing riders up hills. They can be
      spun around to reverse-thrust to a stop.<br>
      <br>
      The Dreamscience thruster design is still in the experimental
      stages, and Contoret has been seeking out athletes more
      experienced than himself to test it with different sports gear. He
      explains that Dreamscience works in development, patenting and
      prototyping, so it will have to seek out a manufacturing partner
      if a thruster-bar is ever to make its way to production. He
      roughly estimates a retail price between US$5,000 and $10,000,
      with the possibility of dropping to a more mainstream price level
      later down the line.<br>
      <br>
      Earlier this northern winter, professional snowboarder Jamie
      Barrow grabbed hold of the Dreamscience thruster prototype and
      fired his way across a frozen lake in St. Moritz, Switzerland,
      hitting speeds of 50 mph (80 km/h). You can watch him in the video
      below.<br>

      </div>
      <br>
      Apparatus and method for propelling a user wearing paragliding
      equipment are disclosed The apparatus includes at least one
      thruster for providing thrust in a predetermined direction; and an
      attachment element for attaching the at least one thruster to a
      user's body such that the thruster is secured against the front
      portion of the user's body.<br>
      <br>
      <b>FIELD</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0002] The present invention relates to an apparatus and method
      for paragliders. In particular, but not exclusively, the present
      invention relates to an improved means of propulsion for use by an
      individual when engaging in paragliding, powered paragliding,
      paramotoring, hang gliding, and other similar sporting activities.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0003] Paragliding equipment in general is well known and
      generally includes a harness section that a user secures to his
      body with loops and restraints to enable the user to be
      comfortably suspended in flight and move relatively freely, and a
      wing section (canopy) of fabric designed to act as an aerofoil for
      slowing the rate of fall of a user and for capturing lift from
      thermal air movement. In use, the user is suspended below the
      canopy via suspension wires.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Powered paragliding or paramotoring is also known, in which
      a paraglider mounts an engine or electric power source to his or
      her back to add power to the paragliding activity.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] JP4092798 discloses such type of powered device.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0006] According to a first aspect of the present disclosure there
      is provided apparatus for propelling a user wearing paragliding
      equipment, comprising:<br>
      <br>
      [0007] at least one thruster for providing thrust in a
      predetermined direction; and<br>
      <br>
      [0008] an attachment element for attaching the at least one
      thruster to a user's body such that the thruster is secured
      against the front portion of the user's body.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] According to a second aspect of the present disclosure
      there is provided a kit of parts comprising apparatus as defined
      in the first aspect of the disclosure and a harness element and a
      fabric wing member.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] According to a third aspect of the present disclosure there
      is provided a method of propelling a user over land or water,
      comprising providing an apparatus as defined in the first aspect
      of the disclosure, providing a harness and a fabric wind member,
      and causing the at least one thruster to move air to thereby
      propel the user.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] Aptly, the apparatus comprises two thrusters. This may help
      to balance the apparatus when attached to a user.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] Aptly, the thrusters are provided at opposed ends of a
      rigid member, and the thrusters are attached to the user's body
      via the rigid member.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] In some preferred embodiments the attachment element
      comprises a harness or belt.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] Aptly, the attachment element further comprises a connector
      for connecting the harness or belt to the rigid member.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] Aptly, the attachment element is arranged to provide
      attachment of the at least one thruster to the user's body in the
      region of the user's hips. With this arrangement, the user is
      allowed a high freedom of movement, including both a sitting
      position and a standing position.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] Aptly, the at least one thruster comprises a housing and an
      air moving device mounted within the housing.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] Aptly the apparatus further comprises a control device for
      adjusting the speed of the at least one thruster. This helps to
      enhance the user experience and may also act as a safety feature
      for giving increased controllability over the equipment.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] In some preferred embodiments the control device is a
      hand-held unit. The user may be able to conveniently control wires
      of the paragliding unit as well as the speed of the thruster with
      a single hand.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] Aptly, the control device comprises a user input means for
      the user to start, stop, increase and/or decrease the speed of the
      at least one thruster.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] Aptly the apparatus further comprises a further control
      device for adjusting an angle of thrust provided by the at least
      one thruster. Again, this helps to enhance the user experience and
      controllability over the equipment.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] Aptly, the further control device is a hand-held unit.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] Aptly, the further control device comprises a further user
      input means for the user to change the angle of thrust of the at
      least one thruster.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] Aptly the apparatus may further comprise at least one
      weighting element operably connected to the at least one thruster
      for influencing the direction of thrust provided by the at least
      one thruster.<br>
      <br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0032] According to an embodiment of the present invention, as
      shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, apparatus 10 comprises a rigid member 12
      which is typically a bar or tube made from a lightweight material.
      Suitably, the rigid member 12 is made from a lightweight metal or
      a suitably strong plastic or plastics composite material. In some
      preferred forms, the rigid member 12 is straight (i.e.
      rectilinear). However, in particular embodiments, the rigid member
      12 may be curved, or include curves, for example to provide
      gripping portions which facilitate the holding of the rigid member
      12 in a user's hands. Such gripping portions may, for example have
      a surface comprising a high friction material, for example a
      rubbery material, on which a user can maintain a strong and
      comfortable grip.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] At respective opposed ends of the rigid member 12 is
      mounted a thruster 16. That is, each end of the rigid member 12
      carries a thruster 16. Any suitable means known in the art may be
      used to attach the thrusters 16 to the respective ends of the
      rigid member 12, for example by means of mechanical fastening
      means, for example clips or bolts, or by suitably strong adhesive,
      or by welding. The thrusters 16 are operably connected to the
      rigid member 12 and may be fixedly attached to the rigid member 12
      or moveably attached to the rigid member 12, for example. In other
      embodiments, the apparatus may include only one thrusters (e.g.
      mounted centrally to the user), or may include any other number of
      thrusters.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] Each thruster 16 comprises a housing 18 which is attached
      to the respective end of the rigid member 12. The housing 18
      defines a channel or passage 20 that defines an air flow pathway
      through the housing.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] Associated with each passage 20 is an air moving means 22.
      Preferably the air moving means 22 comprises a fan or propeller 24
      with a plurality of air-moving blades 24a. Preferably the air
      moving means is mounted with the passage 20. Air moving means 22
      is configured to cause, in operation, a flow of air through the
      passage 20 from the front side F to the rear side R of the
      apparatus. The movement of air through the passage 20 by the air
      moving means 22 is sufficient to provide a forward thrust (that
      is, generally in the direction of arrow T) to the apparatus 10.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] The housing 18 also provides protection against a rotor
      failure by the air moving means 22.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] Air moving means 22 will, in preferred embodiments, cause
      movement of air through passage 22 by rotation of a fan or
      propeller about an axis A, extending perpendicular to the plane of
      the page in FIG. 1, that is, from the front to the back of the
      housing. The axis A will normally be arranged substantially
      centrally with respect to the passage 20.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] A drive means or arrangement is provided to cause rotation
      of the fan or propeller about axis A. Preferred drive means is an
      electric motor. A single electric motor may be provided to drive
      the air moving means 22 of both thrusters 16, for example by way
      of drive belts or drive shaft. In this case, the motor may
      conveniently be mounted on the rigid member 12, approximately
      equidistantly from the respective thrusters 16. In preferred
      arrangements, however, each air moving means 22 has an associated
      electric motor which is preferably arranged co-axially with the
      air moving means (that is, co-axially with the fan or propeller
      24, in preferred embodiments). In some preferred embodiments, the
      electric motor is coupled directly to the fan or propeller 24
      without any intervening gearing or linkage.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] The rotation of the fan or propeller about the axis A may
      be in the region of 10,000 to 100,000 rpm and more aptly between
      25,000 and 45,000 rpm and even more aptly around 35,000 rpm. The
      thrust values may be around 30 to 50 pound of thrust (15 to 25 kg)
      per thruster 16. The thrust should be sufficient to propel the
      user, with net thrust possibly lower than the combined weight of
      the user and apparatus. In some situations it may be possible to
      increase the net thrust to a value greater than the combined
      weight of the user and apparatus.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] The drive means requires a power source in order operably
      to cause movement of the air moving means 22. Where the drive
      means is an electric motor, the power source is conveniently a
      battery, or a battery pack. Other known portable sources of
      electric power are useable in principle, provided always that such
      sources can conveniently be carried by a user while engaging in
      paragliding or other such sport using the apparatus of the
      invention. A battery pack is illustrated schematically at 26 in
      FIGS. 1 and 2. As illustrated, the battery pack 26 is mounted on
      the outside of housing 18, but other locations may be possible,
      for example within the housing 18 (if the housing 18 is
      appropriately shaped) or within a hollow interior part of rigid
      member 12. The location of battery packs for the respective
      thrusters 16 (specifically for the drive means of the air moving
      means 22) is selected to ensure that the weight of the battery
      packs is evenly distributed with respect to the apparatus as a
      whole. It would be undesirable for one thruster 16 to appear to a
      user to be heavier than the other thruster 16.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] In alternative arrangements, one or more battery packs 26
      may be carried about the user's person, for example by means of a
      supporting harness, e.g. attachable around a user's neck as shown
      in FIG. 7, the battery pack 26 being connected to the electric
      motors by suitable electrical connectors, notably wires.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] Typically, each of the thrusters may require in the region
      of 5 to 25 KW of energy, which may be delivered by a lithium
      polymer (LiPo) battery pack via an electronic speed controller to
      brushless motors with high magnetic fields. A fan with diameter of
      around 15 cm diameter turning at around 35,000 rpm using brushless
      motor and 14 cell LiPo battery of 5 AmpHour rating will produce
      about 12 kg of thrust. Current draw would be 150 Amps at 54 Volts
      (corresponding to about 8000 Watt power consumption).<br>
      <br>
      [0043] The wind speed leaving the thruster 16 may be around 100
      ms&lt;-1 &gt;or more, which is higher than conventional propellers
      (that turn at a few thousand rpm). As such, the torque on the
      thruster shaft is very low compared to a conventional propeller,
      resulting in a higher degree of manoeuvrability of the apparatus
      and more predictable control, avoiding torque steer. Also, the
      high wind velocity output of each thruster ensures that thrust is
      not significantly reduced by motion of the apparatus as the speed
      differential is not as significant. As such, even under extreme
      speeds including freefall the apparatus remains manoeuvrable.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] Referring now in particular to FIGS. 3 to 6, a user 100 is
      shown wearing an attachment element 32, which in this case is a
      harness secured around the user's waist and legs (in a similar
      manner to a rock climbing harness), and which harness is attached
      to the thruster apparatus 10. Having the harness around the user's
      waist and legs, or in the region of the hips in general, helps to
      allow the user to adopt various positions (in the air and on the
      ground) including where the user is bent at the hips, without the
      apparatus being substantially affected by the movement or user's
      body shape. It will be appreciated that instead of a harness as
      shown in the figures, alternatively a line, cord, wire, cable,
      strap or belt could be used as the attachment element that fits
      around the user's waist. In some configurations the attachment
      element 32 may be sufficiently robust to assist in conveying
      thrust from the apparatus 10 to a user's body, so allowing greater
      precision by the user in setting the orientation, attitude or
      alignment of the apparatus 10.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] The apparatus 10 also includes a connector 34 which in this
      case is a looped strap connecting the harness to the rigid member
      12. In some embodiments the connector could include a quick
      release system acting to prevent separation of the user and the
      apparatus but allowing separation in an emergency situation. Such
      means are, per se, well known in the art. In some embodiments the
      connector may be integral with the attachment element.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] In some preferred embodiments, the apparatus 10 includes a
      control device (not shown) for adjusting the speed (rpm) of the
      thrusters. This may be a hand held unit including a button or
      other user input means for allowing the user to specify the
      stopping and starting of the thrusters, and optionally also the
      increase or decrease in speed of the thrusters. The user input
      means may be mechanical or electronic, having a link, for example
      a wire, chord or wireless signal to the thrusters for signalling
      the speed change. When the control device is hand held, this helps
      the user to be able to keep his hands on the wires of the
      paragliding equipment to control the canopy, and at the same time
      control the thruster speed. Of course it is also possible to have
      the control device in other convenient areas for the user to
      reach.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] In some preferred embodiments, the apparatus 10 includes
      another control device (not shown), in addition to or instead of
      the above-mentioned control device, for adjusting the angle of
      thrust of the thrusters relative to the user. This also may be a
      hand held unit including a button or other user input means for
      allowing the user to specify the direction of the thrusters. The
      user input means may be mechanical or electronic, having a link,
      for example a wire, chord or wireless signal to the thrusters for
      signalling the angle change. When the control device is hand held,
      this helps the user to be able to keep his hands on the wires of
      the paragliding equipment to control the canopy, and at the same
      time control the thruster angle of direction. Of course it is also
      possible to have the control device in other convenient areas for
      the user to reach, or the user could manually change the angle of
      the thrusters by adjusting the rigid member 12 for example.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] For example, initially, for a standing start, the thrusters
      should face forwards for take off. Then subsequent to take off,
      and during flight mode, a user is likely to adopt a sitting
      position in the paragliding harness. This change of body position
      of the user is likely to alter the angle of thrust that the
      thrusters provide. Therefore, the above-mentioned control device
      (thruster adjuster) may be useful for the user to maintain the
      direction of thrust required.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] In an alternative embodiment, any kind of weighting element
      could be operably connected to the thrusters so as to influence
      the direction of thrust by use of gravity. This could be a
      weighted chain for example hanging from the thruster housing 18.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] A user 100 wearing the apparatus 10 of the invention, along
      with a paragliding harness 50 and wires 52 is shown in FIG. 7. In
      use the user can attach the apparatus 10 to his body and then don
      the paragliding equipment in the known manner.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] With the present invention, the attachment of the apparatus
      to the front area of a user's body enables a standard paragliding
      harness to be fitted over the apparatus without special adaptation
      to either part. Also, the apparatus positioned on the body lies
      out of the field of use of the standard paragliding equipment, and
      thus does not interfere with the wearing of the paragliding
      equipment or the functioning of the paragliding equipment.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] Furthermore, as a safety aspect, it will be appreciated
      that providing a connecting part between the thrusters and the
      attachment element that is also forward of the user's body will
      allow the user to more easily reach for a quick release button for
      example in an emergency situation, which would be more difficult
      to do if the thrusters were mounted on the user's back as per
      prior art devices.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] It will be appreciated that with the present invention,
      superior control and handling of the apparatus can be achieved
      compared to prior known devices. Furthermore, although the
      apparatus of the present invention may require a higher fan speed
      than some known devices, the apparatus will be lighter and have a
      profile with a smaller surface area than known devices. Thus, less
      drag will be encountered in use.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] In addition, since the apparatus allows for more acute
      handling, with the direction of thrust being completely
      controllable, this can have further benefits in terms of safety as
      well as user enjoyment. For example, avoidance of obstacles or
      hazards is more easily achievable.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] Furthermore, by swivelling the rigid member by 180[deg.],
      for example, it is possible to reverse the direction of thrust and
      enable a controlled stop. In use in an airborne activity, it may
      be possible to use the apparatus to slow or arrest the decent of
      the user. Typically known parachutes, including backup parachutes,
      cannot operate in the height range of less than 100 m. The present
      invention could therefore be used as a short distance decelerator
      for reducing falling speed in an emergency situation.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] Alternatively in other embodiments, the apparatus 10 may
      include a mechanism to prevent the thrusters from reaching an
      unwanted angle relative to the user. For example, a stopper
      element could be used to provide a maximum angle or a limited
      range of angles through which the thrusters can be rotated. This
      mechanism could be used to prevent, for example, reverse thrust
      when the thrusters are rotated through 180[deg.] for situations
      when this is not desirable. Optionally, the apparatus may also
      include a bypass mechanism to override the stopper element for use
      in emergency situations.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] In certain embodiments, the apparatus 10 may include a
      quick release mechanism for use in emergency situations. For
      example, where the apparatus is tethered to the user's waist area,
      the quick release mechanism may include a means of lengthening the
      tether to a length such that the apparatus moves to around
      shoulder height of the user. Then, the user may hang onto the
      apparatus in a free fall deceleration manoeuvre. The user may use
      downward thrust to remain upright in a thrust decelerated fall.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] It will also be appreciated that since the source of thrust
      is forward of the centre of mass of the moving body, this
      arrangement will be inherently more stable than having a thrust
      source behind the body. For example, in a crash situation, the
      human body is often thrown forward with a forward momentum. With
      known apparatus located behind the body, the apparatus could
      continue to push the body forward. With the present invention, the
      apparatus will thrust forward of the centre of mass and likely
      detach from the body. The invention could include a safety measure
      to ensure that the thrusters are automatically stopped upon
      detachment from a user.<br>

      <br>
      A personal propulsion apparatus and method are disclosed. The
      apparatus (10) includes first and second air-moving thrusters (16)
      arranged at opposed ends a rigid member (12) and drive means
      operable to cause the thrusters to move<br>
      <br>
      The present invention relates to a person propulsion apparatus and
      method. In particular, but not exclusively, the present invention
      relates to an apparatus and method for use principally in sporting
      or physical activities, in particular so-called "extreme sports"
      including skateboarding, snowboarding, skiing, surfing, power
      kiting and the like. The present invention provides an improved
      means of propulsion for use by an individual when engaging in such
      or similar activities.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Personal propulsion means for sporting and physical activities per
      se are known.<br>

      single propeller attached to a harness and mounted on a user's
      back;<br>
      <br>
      US 7 179 141 (McMullen) which teaches a harness by which a user
      mounts an internal combustion engine on his back. The internal
      combustion engine has a belt-drive to an axle of a single
      propeller, which in turn is intended to impart motion to a user,
      e.g. when skiing;<br>
      <br>
      US 5 222 569 (Martel) teaches a motor and propeller for mounting
      to a user's rear pelvic area for providing forward thrust, such as
      when skiing;<br>
      <br>
      US 2006/0196991 (Martin) teaches a personal flight device which
      includes an engine and at least a pair of tiltable fans driven by
      the motor. The fans and motor are mounted on a housing which is
      secured to a pilot.<br>

        <br>
      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Referring now to the drawings, the apparatus 10 of the invention
      comprises a rigid member 12 which is typically a bar or tube made
      from a lightweight material. Suitably, the rigid member 12 is made
      from a lightweight metal or a suitably strong plastic or plastics
      composite material. In some preferred forms, the rigid member 12
      is straight (i.e. rectilinear). However, in particular
      embodiments, the rigid member 12 may be curved, or include curves,
      for example to provide gripping portions which facilitate the
      holding of the rigid member 12 in a user's hands. Gripping
      portions or regions are schematically illustrated at 14 in Figures
      1 and 2. Such gripping portions 14 may, for example have a surface
      comprising a high friction material, for example a rubbery
      material, on which a user can maintain a strong and comfortable
      grip.<br>
      <br>
      At respective opposed ends of the rigid member 12 is mounted a
      thruster 16. That is, each end of the rigid member 12 carries a
      thruster 16. Any suitable means known in the art may be used to
      attach the thrusters 16 to the respective ends of the rigid member
      12, for example by means of mechanical fastening means, for
      example clips or bolts, or by suitably strong adhesive, or by
      welding. Each thruster 16 comprises a housing 18 which is attached
      to the respective end of the rigid member 12. The housing 18
      defines a channel or passage 20 that defines an air flow pathway
      through the housing.<br>
      Associated with each passage 20 is an air moving means 22.
      Preferably the air moving means 22 comprises a fan or propeller 24
      with a plurality of air-moving blades 24a.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably the air moving means is mounted with the passage 20.
      Air moving means 22 is configured to cause, in operation, a flow
      of air through the passage 20 from the front side F to the rear
      side R of the apparatus. The movement of air through the passage
      20 by the air moving means 22 is sufficient to provide a forward
      thrust (that is, generally in the direction of arrow T) to the
      apparatus 10.<br>
      The housing 18 also provides protection against a rotor failure by
      the air moving means 22.<br>
      <br>
      Air moving means 22 will, in preferred embodiments, cause movement
      of air through passage 22 by rotation of a fan or propeller about
      an axis A, extending perpendicular to the plane of the page in
      Figure 1 , that is, from the front to the back of the housing. The
      axis A will normally be arranged substantially centrally with
      respect to the passage 20.<br>
      <br>
      A drive means or arrangement is provided to cause rotation of the
      fan or propeller about axis A. Preferred drive means is an
      electric motor. A single electric motor may be provided to drive
      the air moving means 22 of both thrusters 16, for example by way
      of drive belts or drive shaft. In this case, the motor may
      conveniently be mounted on the rigid member 12, approximately
      equidistantly from the respective thrusters 16. In preferred
      arrangements, however, each air moving means 22 has an associated
      electric motor which is preferably arranged co-axially with the
      air moving means (that is, co-axially with the fan or propeller
      24, in preferred embodiments). In some preferred embodiments, the
      electric motor is coupled directly to the fan or propeller 24
      without any intervening gearing or linkage.<br>
      <br>
      The rotation of the fan or propeller about the axis A may be in
      the region of 10,000 to 100,000 rpm and more aptly between 25,000
      and 45,000rpm and even more aptly around 35,000 rpm. The thrust
      values may be around 30 to 50 pound of thrust (15 to 25 kg) per
      thruster 16. The thrust should be sufficient to propel the user,
      with net thrust possibly lower than the combined weight of the
      user and apparatus.<br>
      <br>
      The drive means requires a power source in order operably to cause
      movement of the air moving means 22. Where the drive means is an
      electric motor, the power source is conveniently a battery, or a
      battery pack. Other known portable sources of electric power are
      useable in principle, provided always that such sources can
      conveniently be carried by a user while engaging in physical
      activity (e.g. sport) using the apparatus of the invention. A
      battery pack is illustrated schematically at 26 in Figures 1 and
      2. As illustrated, the battery pack 26 is mounted on the outside
      of housing 18, but other locations may be possible, for example
      within the housing 18 (if the housing 18 is appropriately shaped)
      or within a hollow interior part of rigid member 12. The location
      of battery packs for the respective thrusters 16 (specifically for
      the drive means of the air moving means 22) is selected to ensure
      that the weight of the battery packs is evenly distributed with
      respect to the apparatus as a whole. It would be undesirable for
      one thruster 16 to appear to a user to be heavier than the other
      thruster 16.<br>
      <br>
      In alternative arrangements, one or more battery packs 26 may be
      carried about the user's person, for example by means of a
      supporting harness, the battery pack 26 being connected to the
      electric motors by suitable electrical connectors, notably wires.<br>
      <br>
      Typically, each of the thrusters may require in the region of 5 to
      25 KW of energy, which may be delivered by a lithium polymer
      (LiPo) battery pack via an electronic speed controller to
      brushless motors with high magnetic fields. A fan with diameter of
      around 15 cm diameter turning at around 35,000 rpm using brushless
      motor and 14 cell LiPo battery of 5AmpHour rating will produce
      about 12 kg of thrust. Current draw would be 150 Amps at 54 Volts
      (corresponding to about 8000 Watt power consumption).<br>
      <br>
      The wind speed leaving the thruster 16 may be around 100
      ms&lt;"1&gt; or more, which is higher than conventional propellers
      (that turn at a few thousand rpm). As such, the torque on the
      thruster shaft is very low compared to a conventional propeller,
      resulting in a higher degree of manoeuvrability of the apparatus
      and more predictable control, avoiding torque steer. Also, the
      high wind velocity output of each thruster ensures that thrust is
      not significantly reduced by motion of the apparatus as the speed
      differential is not as significant. As such, even under extreme
      speeds including freefall the apparatus remains manoeuvrable.<br>
      <br>
      In some embodiments, fastening means 28 may be provided for
      attaching the apparatus 10 to a user's body, for example to a
      harness or belt. For example, the fastening means may attach the
      apparatus 10 to the user's body such that the apparatus is held
      forward of the user's body. In this case the apparatus would act
      to pull the user along rather than push the user. The fastening
      means may typically be in the form of a line, cord, wire, cable,
      strap or belt. In some configurations the fastening means 28 may
      be sufficiently robust to assist in conveying thrust from the
      apparatus 10 to a user's body. This may have the advantage of
      reducing the strain on a user's arms as he holds the apparatus 10
      in use, so allowing greater precision by the user in setting the
      orientation, attitude or alignment of the apparatus 10. In other
      embodiments, the fastening means 28 is intended only to prevent
      separation of the apparatus 10 from the user in the event that the
      user lets go of the rigid member 12, for example as a result of an
      inadvertent trip or fall. In some embodiments, the fastening means
      maybe provided with user-operated quick release means, shown
      schematically at 30 in Figures 1 and 2. Such means are, per se,
      well known in the art. In some embodiments, the fastening means
      may attach the apparatus to the user such that the thrust force
      acts through the user's centre of mass. This may be useful when it
      is preferred the apparatus propels the user from their centre of
      mass, rather than producing an adverse moment that may affect the
      user's balance or direction.<br>
      <br>
      Referring now in particular to Figure 3, a user 100 is shown
      grasping an apparatus 10 of the invention. The user 100 is
      standing on a land board 200. A land board 200 is broadly similar
      to a conventional skateboard but is generally larger and has four
      wheels mounted externally of the board perimeter (in contrast to a
      skateboard where the wheels are typically arranged underneath the
      board). Land boards are known for use in the sport of kite land
      boarding where the user is pulled along overland (beach, hard
      surface, grass etc) by a kite. The land board 200 is just one
      example of a suitable vehicle or conveyance for use with the
      apparatus of the invention, other examples including skateboards,
      bicycles, tricycles, quadricycles, roller-blades, roller-skates,
      skis and snowboards. The apparatus 10 may be used in water sports
      in conjunction with water craft (small boats, dinghies, canoes and
      kayaks), surfboards and the like. In other possibilities, the
      apparatus 10 can be used in conjunction with the chassis of a land
      yacht (that is, a land yacht without its mast and sail) or
      similarly constructed vehicles.<br>
      <br>
      As can be seen from Figure 3, in use, the user 100 grasps the
      apparatus 10 so that a firm hold is obtained on the rigid member
      12. The user 100 holds the apparatus 10 generally forwardly of his
      body with the thrusters 16 in operation. A "jet" of air is
      provided from each thruster 16, in a rearward direction, so urging
      the apparatus 10 to move forwardly. As the user 100 is mounted on
      land board 200, the thrust imparted by the thrusters 16 causes the
      land board 200 to move forward, carrying the user in a forward
      direction.<br>
      <br>
      Figures 4a to 4d illustrate some of the various different
      attitudes and orientations which a user 100 may cause the
      apparatus 10 to adopt, in order to control his motion. As will be
      clearly apparent, the user 100 can position the apparatus 20 by
      movement of his wrists, elbows and shoulders so that an almost
      infinite number of positions of the apparatus 10 can be adopted.
      Arrows D&lt;1&gt; to D&lt;4&gt; illustrate possible rotations of
      the apparatus 10 (by movement of the user's wrists) to vary the
      orientation of the apparatus 10. A user 100 soon becomes adept at
      setting the position, orientation and/or attitude of the apparatus
      10 to match his desired speed and direction of motion. In a
      particular example, deceleration can be achieved by rotation of
      the apparatus so that the propulsion force is directed rearwardly.
      In further embodiments, a user operable control device may be
      provided by means of which the user 100 can control the operation
      of the thrusters 16. In particular, the user may control the
      amount of thrust provided by controlling the speed of movement of
      the air moving means 22. In further embodiments, the control
      device is operable to control the respective thrusters 16
      independently, for example to compensate for environmental
      conditions (wind, terrain) or for changes of direction.<br>
      <br>
      A user operable control device may comprise a mouth-operated
      controller to stop, start, increase speed, decrease speed, etc. of
      the thrusters. This would enable the user to keep both hands free
      to grip the rigid member.<br>
      <br>
      It will be appreciated that in general the apparatus of the
      invention may be used to assist a user in sporting activities to
      increase their velocity and momentum compared to the usual
      velocities and momentums achieved without such apparatus.<br>
      <br>
      It will be appreciated that with the present invention, superior
      control and handling of the apparatus can be achieved compared to
      prior known devices. Furthermore, although the apparatus of the
      present invention may require a higher fan speed than some known
      devices, the apparatus will be lighter and have a profile with a
      smaller surface area than known devices. Thus, less drag will be
      encountered in use.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, since the apparatus allows for more acute handling,
      with the direction of thrust being completely controllable, this
      can have further benefits in terms of safety as well as user
      enjoyment. For example, avoidance of obstacles or hazards is more
      easily achievable.<br>
      <br>
      Furthermore, by swivelling the rigid member by 180[deg.], for
      example, it is possible to reverse the direction of thrust and
      enable a controlled stop. In use in an airborne activity, it may
      be possible to use the apparatus to slow or arrest the decent of
      the user. Typically known parachutes cannot operate in the height
      range of less than 100 m.<br>
      <br>
      It will also be appreciated that since the source of thrust is
      forward of the centre of mass of the moving body, this arrangement
      will be inherently more stable than having a thrust source behind
      the body. For example, in a crash situation, the human body is
      often thrown forward with a forward momentum. With known apparatus
      located behind the body, the apparatus could continue to push the
      body forward. With the present invention, the apparatus will
      thrust forward of the centre of mass and likely detach from the
      body. The invention could include a safety measure to ensure that
      the thrusters are automatically stopped upon detachment from a
      user.<br>
      <br>
      With the present invention, the attachment of the apparatus to the
      front area of a user's body enables standard sporting equipment,
      for example a paragliding harness or power kite harness, to be
      fitted over the apparatus without special adaptation to either
      part. Also, the apparatus's position of use with respect to the
      body lies out of the field of use of most sporting equipment, and
      thus does not interfere with the wearing or the functioning of the
      sporting equipment.<br>
      <br>
      Furthermore, as a safety aspect, it will be appreciated that
      providing a connecting part between the thrusters and the body
      that is also forward of the user's body will allow the user to
      more easily reach for a quick release button for example in an
      emergency situation, which would be more difficult to do if the
      thrusters were mounted on the user's back as per prior art
      devices.<br>
