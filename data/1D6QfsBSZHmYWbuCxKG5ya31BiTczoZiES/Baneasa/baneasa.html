      <br>
      Romanian university student Corneliu Birtok-Baneasa of the eastern
      town of Deva has won bronze in this year ARCA international
      invention fair of Zagreb for a filter the allows a 20-percent cut
      in fuel consumption by cars.<br>
      <br>
      ‘I won the bronze, which is quite good. There were 15 Romanian
      inventions in the show, seven of which won medals,’ Birtok-Baneasa
      , currently attending a specialist seminar in Croatia, told
      Agerpres on Tuesday.<br>
      <br>
      The invention of the young man of Deva has also won silver in this
      year’s international invention shows of Moscow and Geneva and in
      2008 it won gold in the Inventica Bucharest and Eureka Brussels
      shows.<br>
      <br>
      The air filter invented by him allows for an up to 20 percent cut
      in fuel consumption in urban traffic. The invention has been
      experimentally tested on at least 40 vehicles, from the less to
      the most expensive, and the results were commended by the users.<br>
      <br>
      The student does not intend to sell his invention and wants to
      create a production line in Romania that would manufacture the
      filters for affordable prices of between RON 80 and 100.<br>
      Corneliu Birtok-Baneasa is a senior student at the Hunedoara
      Faculty of Engineering, majoring in road motor vehicles.<br>

      <br>
      Romanian inventor Corneliu Birtok-Baneasa on Saturday received the
      gold medal from the Hong Kong delegation in the International
      Exhibition of Inventions of Geneva for a device allowing the
      reduction in the fuel consumption in trucks by up to 7 percent,
      writes Agerpress.<br>
      <br>
      Corneliu Birtok-Baneasa invented the “dynamic device for air
      transfer” (DDAT), a complex piece that attached to the engine will
      reduce fuel consumption.<br>
      <br>
      “The Jury in Geneva is very strict, as ever year. We had four
      members of the international jury who asked me questions about
      DDAT. The International Geneva Jury is made up of specialists with
      doctorates, in my case, auto-engineers”, Corneliu said for
      Adevarul Hunedoara.<br>
      <br>
      “It is an invention for trucks. I perfected it and ran the first
      tests at the Engineering Faculty in Hunedoara. The prototype was
      tested on trucks belonging to a firm in Deva. Practical results
      showed an increase in engine power of 4 percent, and fuel savings
      were as high as 7 percent.(…) The device is now tested on buses
      for the local public transport system in Alba-Iulia, and the
      results are positive”, Corneliu explained.<br>
      <br>
      According to the inventor, the device he designed caught the
      attention of the Romanian Association for International Transport
      (ARTRI) who is interested in using the device on its trucks. A
      simple calculation shows that transport companies with trucks that
      travel even a million kilometers per year could significantly cut
      their fuel expenses by applying this invention.<br>
      <br>
      “Think of it this way: you can save two litres of gasoline for
      every 100 kilometers. Overall, that’s a substantial saving, not at
      all negligible given the current pricing policy for fuel”.<br>

      <div align="center"><big><b>Air Filter That Sensibly Increases
            Engine Power and MPG Patented by Romanian Engineer</b></big><br>
        <b>by Ovidiu Sandru </b><br>
        <br>
      </div>
      Corneliu Birtok-Baneasa, a Romanian engineer, has invented a
      groundbreaking air filter that decreases the fuel consumption by
      10 to 15 percent and&nbsp; raises an engine’s power by up to 10
      percent. He patented the device that had been already awarded at
      various international invention congresses.<br>
      <br>
      “I am involved in a venture with multiple companies for producing
      a stock of about 200 supercharged filters, and then I’ll request
      the patent certificate for this product to the Romanian Auto
      Register,” he told press agency MediaFax. “I am hoping that by the
      end of the year we’ll have finalized all of the procedures needed
      by the Register, after which we’ll move on to mass production, for
      the free market. We may begin making it as soon as we’ll get the
      authorities’ approval, since the production lines have already
      been set up.”<br>
      <br>
      The 33-year-old engineer from Deva explained that, besides its
      classic filtering function, his product raises the intake air
      speed, pre-cools it and raises the filter’s filling coefficient.<br>
      <br>
      “Supercharged or multifunctional air filters give the incoming air
      a different type of dynamic and are adapted to the shape of the
      intake hoses, which makes them fit for 80 percent of the engines
      on the market,” Birtok said.<br>
      <br>
      He also mentioned that once mounted, the filter would raise the
      engine’s power by 8 to 10 percent, while the fuel consumption
      would drop by 10 to 15 percent.<br>
      <br>
      “For instance, a car’s engine using the supercharged filter will
      have the same amount of power at 2,600 rpm as one revving at 3,000
      rpm, but using a conventional filter.”<br>
      <br>
      The engineer won lots of prizes at invention fairs from Geneva,
      Moscow, Kuwait and Romania. Among the 20 national and
      international award-winning inventions there’s a device called
      “Dynamic Air Transfer Device,” that lowers the fuel consumption
      and gas emissions.<br>
      <br>
      Prices of gas have gone up lately, and this is why I think this
      innovation will surely have an important impact on the worldwide
      car market. If Birtok-Baneasa’s device will get produced on a
      large scale worldwide, we’ll all breathe in a better,
      less-polluted air… at least until someone finds a solution to
      replace gas completely. I can hardly wait to put my hands on one –
      I already see people lining up at the factory gate like those
      iPhone lovers before each launch.<br>
