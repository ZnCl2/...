      <br>
      Scientists have used low-intensity electromagnetic fields to treat
      cancer patients in trials which they say could lead to the
      development of a new type of anti-tumour therapy.<br>
      <br>
      Patients hold a spoon-shaped antenna in their mouths to deliver a
      very low-intensity electromagnetic field in their bodies. In
      trials of patients with advanced liver cancer, the therapy – given
      three times a day – resulted in long-term survival for a small
      number of those monitored, the team has reported in the British
      Journal of Cancer. Their tumours shrank, while healthy cells in
      surrounding tissue were unaffected.<br>
      <br>
      However, the scientists – from the US, Brazil, France and
      Switzerland – also stressed that the technique was still in its
      infancy and would require several years for further trials to take
      place. "This is a truly novel technique," said the team's leader,
      Professor Boris Pasche of the University of Alabama, Birmingham.
      "It is innocuous, can be tolerated for long periods of time, and
      could be used in combination with other therapies."<br>
      <br>
      Pasche added that he had obtained permission from the US Food and
      Drug Administration to carry out trials on large groups of
      patients and was talking to companies in the US, Asia, South
      America, Russia and Europe about raising funds for future
      research.<br>
      <br>
      In 2009, Pasche and his colleagues published results in the
      Journal of Experimental and Clinical Cancer Research which showed
      that low-level electromagnetic fields at precise frequencies –
      ranging from 0.1Hz to 114kHz – halted cancer cell growth in small
      numbers of patients. Different cancers responded to
      electromagnetic fields of different frequencies. Cells in
      surrounding, healthy tissue were unaffected.<br>
      <br>
      The exact mechanism for this process was not explained in the
      paper. However, results of recent experiments by the team – using
      cancer cell cultures in the laboratory and published in the
      British Journal of Cancer – suggest that low-level electromagnetic
      fields interfere with the activity of genes in cancer cells. In
      specific cases, this affected the ability of cancer cells to grow
      and divide. The spread of tumours halted and in some cases they
      began to shrink.<br>
      <br>
      "This is extremely exciting," said Pasche. "We think the technique
      could also be used to treat breast tumours and possibly other
      forms of cancer."<br>
      <br>
      The use of electromagnetic fields was also welcomed, cautiously,
      by Eleanor Barrie of Cancer Research UK: "This research shows how
      specific low frequencies of electromagnetic radiation can slow the
      growth of cancer cells in the lab. It's still unclear why the
      cancer cells respond in this way, and it's not yet clear if this
      approach could help patients, but it's an interesting example of
      how researchers are working to find new ways to home in on cancer
      cells while leaving healthy cells unharmed."<br>
      <br>
      The use of electromagnetic fields to treat tumours may seem
      surprising given recent controversy over claims that fields
      generated by mobile phones and electricity pylons can trigger
      cancers and leukaemia. However, Pasche stressed that the intensity
      of the fields used in his team's experiments were between 100 and
      1,000 times lower than those from a mobile phone. "In any case,
      the evidence produced from major studies of users of these phones
      does not suggest there is a clearly identifiable risk posed by
      these electromagnetic fields," he said.<br>

      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</span><br>
      <br>
      [0005] According to invention, an electronic system is provided
      which is activatable by electrical power. The system is employed
      to influence cellular functions or malfunctions in a warm-blooded
      mammalian subject. The system comprises one or more controllable
      low energy electromagnetic energy generator circuits for
      generating one or more high frequency carrier signals. One or more
      microprocessors or integrated circuits comprising or communicating
      with the one or more generator circuits are provided which are
      also for receiving control information from a source of control
      information. The one or more generator circuits include one or
      more amplitude modulation control signal generators for
      controlling amplitude modulated variations of the one or more high
      frequency carrier signals. The one or more generator circuits
      furthermore include one or more programmable amplitude modulation
      frequency control signal generators for controlling the frequency
      at which the amplitude modulations are generated. The one or more
      amplitude modulation frequency control generators are, in terms of
      the present invention, adapted to accurately control the frequency
      of the amplitude modulations to within an accuracy of at least
      1000 ppm relative to one or more determined or predetermined
      reference amplitude modulation frequencies selected from within a
      range of 0.1 Hz to 50 kHz. The system furthermore comprises a
      connection or coupling position for connection or coupling to or
      being connected or coupled to an electrically conductive
      applicator for applying to the warm-blooded mammalian subject the
      one or more amplitude-modulated low energy emissions at said
      accurately controlled modulation frequencies.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] The term, "accurately controlled" means that the modulated
      low energy electromagnetic emissions should be modulated to within
      a resolution of at most 1 Hz of an intended higher frequency
      (greater than about 1000 Hz) determined or predetermined
      modulation frequencies. For example, if one of the one or more
      determined or predetermined modulation frequencies to be applied
      to the warm-blooded mammalian subject is 2000 Hz, the accurate
      control should lead to such modulated low energy emission being
      generated at a frequency of between 1999 and 2001 Hz. However, and
      in terms of what has been determined from experiences in treating
      human subjects harbouring cancerous cells with the aim of
      arresting proliferation or killing of such cells, the accurate
      control should lead to a resolution of 0.5, preferably 0.1, more
      preferably 0.01 and indeed most preferably 0.001 Hz of the
      intended determined or predetermined modulation frequency.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] It is furthermore of importance that the stability of the
      emissions is maintained during emission, and that such stability
      should be of the order of 10&lt;-5&gt; , preferably 10&lt;-6&gt; ,
      and more preferably 10&lt;-7&gt; , stability being the relative
      deviation of frequency divided by the desired frequency, e.g. 0,01
      Hz (deviation) / 1'000 Hz (desired freq.) = 10&lt;-5&gt; .<br>
      <br>
      [0008] As already described in said EP 0 592 851 B1 , the system
      includes a microprocessor (which may more recently be replaced by
      an integrated circuit) into which control information is loaded
      from an application storage device. The microprocessor (or now
      alternatively integrated circuit) then controls the function of
      the system to produce the desired therapeutic emission. Also
      described is the provision in the system of an impedance
      transformer connected intermediate the emitter of low energy
      electromagnetic emissions and a probe (here more broadly described
      as an electrically conductive applicator) for applying the
      emissions to the patient. The impedance transformer substantially
      matches the impedance of the patient seen from the emitter circuit
      with the impedance of the output of the emitter circuit.<br>

        4,765,322</span> , such a system has proven to be useful in the
      practice of Low Energy Emission Therapy (LEET, a trademark of
      Symtonic S.A. or a successor of this Company), which involves
      application of emissions of low energy radio frequency (RF)
      electromagnetic waves to a warm-blooded mammalian subject. The
      application has proven to be an effective mode of treating a
      warm-blooded mammalian subject suffering from central nervous
      system (CNS) disorders such as, for example, generalized anxiety
      disorders, panic disorders, sleep disorders including insomnia,
      psychiatric disorders such as depression, obsessive compulsive
      disorders, disorders resulting from substance abuse, sociopathy,
      post traumatic stress disorders or other disorders of the central
      nervous system.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] The system includes an electrically conductive applicator
      12,13 for applying one or more electromagnetic emissions to the
      warm-blooded mammalian subject. One form of applicator consists of
      a probe or mouthpiece 13 which is inserted into the mouth of a
      subject undergoing treatment. Probe 13 is connected to an
      electromagnetic energy emitter (see also FIG. 2), through coaxial
      cable 12 and impedance matching transformer 14.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] It has previously been considered that an efficient
      connection of an electrically conductive applicator to a subject
      could only be achieved by means of a probe which is adapted to be
      applied to any mucosa of the subject, such as by being located
      within oral, nasal, optical, urethral, anal, and/or vaginal
      cavities or surfaces. It has however now been determined that in
      fact satisfactory application of emissions to a patient can be
      achieved by simpler physical contact of the electrically
      conductive applicator with the skin of the patient. Emissions to
      the patient may, for example be achieved by a conductive,
      inductive, capacitive or radiated coupling to the patient. An
      example of a coupling found to be effective involving indirect
      physical contact with the skin of a patient, is an insulated
      applicator to be placed over or within an ear of the patient. The
      emissions thus passed to the patient may be both by capacitive and
      radiated means. An important advantage of a device which does not
      need to be placed in the mouth of a patient is that the patient is
      able to speak clearly during a time of treatment. The treatment is
      accordingly more user-friendly and leads to enhanced patient
      compliance.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] Electronic system 11 also includes a connector or coupler
      for connection to a programmable device such as a computer or an
      interface or receiver 16 which is adapted to receive an
      application storage device 52 such as, for example, magnetic
      media, semiconductor media, optical media or mechanically encoded
      media, or programmed emissions programmed with control information
      employed to control the operation of system 11 so that the desired
      type of low energy emission therapy is applied to the patient.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] Application storage device 52 can be provided with a
      microprocessor which, when applied to interface 16, operates to
      control the function of system 11 to apply the desired low energy
      emission therapy. Alternatively, application storage device 52 can
      be provided with a microprocessor which is used in combination
      with microprocessor 21 within system 11. In such case, the
      microprocessor within device 52 could assist in the interfacing of
      storage device 52 with system 11, or could provide security
      checking functions.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] System 11 also includes a display 17 which can display
      various indications of the operation of system 11. In addition,
      system 11 includes on and off power buttons 18 and 19, optionally
      replaced by user interface 21A (refer to Figure 2).<br>
      <br>
      [0026] Referring to FIG. 2, presented is a block diagram of
      exemplary electronic circuitry of system 11, in accordance with
      the present invention. A data processor, such as for example,
      microprocessor or integrated circuit 21, operates as the
      controller for electronic system 11, and is connected to control
      the various components of the system 11 through address bus 22,
      data bus 23 and input/output lines 25. The FIG. 2 is modified as
      compared to FIG.2 of EP 0 592 851 B1 by including what is known as
      a Digital Direct Synthesizer (DDS) 31 which operates as a highly
      accurate and stable modulation frequency generator within the
      system 11. An exemplary DDS device is available from Analog
      Devices of Norwood, MA 02062-9106, USA, Part No AD9835. The device
      is a numerically controlled oscillator and modulation capabilities
      are provided for phase modulation and frequency modulation. As
      represented by dotted line block 102, entitled "PROCESSOR WITH
      DAC", the functionality of the DDS may also be combined with
      microprocessor 21 with digital to analogue converter (DAC).<br>
      <br>
      [0027] Microprocessor 21 preferably includes internal storage for
      the operation of a coded control program, and temporary data. In
      addition, microprocessor 21 includes input/output ports and
      internal timers. Microprocessor 21 may be a microcontroller, for
      example microcontrollers 8048 or 8051 available from Intel
      Corporation.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] The timing for microprocessor 21 is provided by system
      clock oscillator 26A which may be run at any clock frequency
      suitable for the particular type of microprocessor used. An
      exemplary clock frequency is 8.0 MHz. Oscillator 26A may be
      replaced by reference frequency oscillator 26 which secures the
      stability of the accurate modulation frequency. RF (Radio
      Frequency) oscillator 32 may also be employed for this purpose. A
      combination of oscillators is represented by dotted line block
      104, entitled "OSCILLATOR".<br>
      <br>
      [0029] An exemplary operating program for microprocessor 21 is
      presented in flow chart form with reference to FIGS. 11 a-d of EP
      0 592 851 B1 . In general, microprocessor 21 functions to control
      controllable electromagnetic energy generator circuit 29 to
      produce a desired form of modulated low energy electromagnetic
      emission for application to a subject through applicator or probe
      13.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] Dotted line block 29, entitled CONTROLLABLE GENERATOR,
      includes DDS modulation frequency generator 31 and carrier signal
      oscillator 32. Microprocessor 21 operates to activate or
      deactivate controllable generator circuit 29 through oscillator
      disable line 33, as described in greater detail in EP 0 592 851 B1
      . Controllable generator circuit 29 also includes an AM modulator
      and power generator 34 which operates to amplitude modulate a
      carrier signal produced by carrier oscillator 32 on carrier signal
      line 36, with a modulation signal produced by modulation signal
      generator circuit 31 on modulation signal line 37. The combination
      of the functionality of the DDS modulation frequency generator 31,
      with processor 21 with DAC, represented by dotted line block102,
      enables output lines 33 and 37 to be combined to produce a single
      signal. The combination furthermore enables arbitrary or periodic
      wave forms of any shape to be generated, as similarly described in
      EP 0 592 851 B1 .<br>
      <br>
      [0031] Modulator 34 produces an amplitude modulated carrier signal
      on modulated carrier signal line 38, which is then applied to
      emitter output filter circuit 39. The filter circuit 39 is
      connected to probe or applicator 13 via power emission sensor 54,
      coaxial cable 12 and impedance transformer 14.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] Microprocessor 21 controls DDS modulation signal generator
      circuit 31 of controllable generator circuit 29 via interface
      lines 25.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] As is illustrated and described in EU 0 592 851 B1
      microprocessor 21 may select a desired waveform stored in a
      modulation waveform storage device 43 and also controls a waveform
      address generator 41 to produce on waveform address bus 42 a
      sequence of addresses which are applied to modulation signal
      storage device 43 in order to retrieve the selected modulation
      signal. In the embodiment described in EP 0 592 851 B1 , the
      desired modulation signal is retrieved from modulation signal
      storage device 43 and applied to modulation signal bus 44 in
      digital form. Modulation signal bus 44 is applied to wave form
      generator and Digital to Analog Converter (DAC) 46 which converts
      the digital modulation signal into analogue form. This analogue
      modulation signal is then applied to a selective filter 47 which,
      under control of microprocessor 21, filters the analogue
      modulation signal by use of a variable filter network including
      resistor 48 and capacitors 49 and 51 in order to smooth the wave
      form produced by DAC 46 on modulation signal line 20.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] A further embodiment possibility is a combination of
      PROCESSOR WITH DAC dotted line block 102 with OSCILLATOR dotted
      line block 104 or with a combination of oscillators 26 and 26A.
      With such a combination, the hardware solution described in EP 0
      592 851 B1 can be is realized internally in the processor 102 with
      multiple outputs 33 and 37 or a single output combining these
      signals.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] The above embodiment from EP 0 592 851 B1 is in part
      replaced by the functionality of the DDS modulation frequency
      modulator 31. However, if it is determined that emissions of
      different wave forms is desirable, it would be desirable to
      include the modulation signal storage device 43 and wave form
      generator 46 described in EP 0 592 851 B1 . Various modulation
      signal wave forms may then be stored in modulation signal storage
      device 43. Wave forms that have been successfully employed include
      square wave forms or sinusoidal wave forms. Other possible
      modulation signal wave forms include rectified sinusoidal,
      triangular, or other wave forms and combinations of all of the
      above.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] The particular modulation control information employed by
      microprocessor 21 to control the operation of controllable
      generator circuit 29, is stored in application storage device 52.
      The application storage device is conveniently a computer
      comprising or being for receiving the information. Alternatively,
      application storage devices illustrated and described in EP 0 592
      851 B1 , with reference to FIGS. 12, 13, 14 and 15, may be
      selected.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] Interface 16 is configured as appropriate for the
      particular application storage device 52 in use. Interface 16
      translates the control information stored in application storage
      device 52 into a usable form for storage within the memory of
      microprocessor 21 to enable microprocessor 21 to control
      controllable generator circuit 29 to produce the desired modulated
      low energy emission.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] Interface 16 may directly read the information stored on
      application storage device 52, or it may read the information
      through use of various known communications links. For example,
      radio frequency, microwave, telephone, internet or optical based
      communications links may be used to transfer information between
      interface or receiver 16 and application storage device or
      computer 52.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] The system 11 may comprise a user identification device,
      included in by block 21a in Figure 2. Conveniently, such a device
      communicates with the one or more data processors or integrated
      circuits 21 via interface 16, as shown. The user identification
      device may be of any type, a finger print reader being an example.
      Such a reader is for example available from Lenovo, 70563
      Stuttgart, Germany, Part No. 73P4774.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] The control information stored in application storage
      device or computer 52 specifies various controllable parameters of
      the modulated low energy RF electromagnetic emission which is
      applied to a subject through applicator or probe 13. Such
      controllable parameters include, for example, the frequency and
      amplitude of the carrier, the amplitudes and frequencies and wave
      forms of the modulation of the carrier, the duration of the
      emission, the power level of the emission, the duty cycle of the
      emission (i.e., the ratio of on time to off time of pulsed
      emissions applied during a treatment), the sequence of application
      of different modulation frequencies for a particular application,
      and the total number of treatments and duration of each treatment
      prescribed for a particular subject.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] For example, the carrier signal and modulation signal may
      be selected to drive the applicator or probe 13 with an amplitude
      modulated signal in which the carrier signal includes spectral
      frequency components below 1 GHz, and preferably between 1 MHz and
      900 MHz, and in which the modulation signal comprises spectral
      frequency components between 0.1 Hz and 10 KHz, and preferably
      between 1 Hz and 1000 Hz. The one or more modulation frequencies
      may be simultaneously emitted or sequenced to form the modulation
      signal.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] As an additional feature, an electromagnetic emission
      sensor 53 may be provided to detect the presence of
      electromagnetic emissions at the frequency of the carrier
      oscillator 32. Emission sensor 53 provides microprocessor 21 with
      an indication of whether or not electromagnetic emissions at the
      desired frequency are present. Microprocessor 21 then takes
      appropriate action, for example, by displaying an error message on
      display 17, disabling controllable generator circuit 29, or the
      like.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] A power sensor 54 is preferably included which detects the
      amount of power applied to the subject through applicator or probe
      13 compared to the amount of power returned or reflected from the
      subject. This ratio is indicative of the proper use of the system
      during a therapeutic session. Power sensor 54 applies to
      microprocessor 21 through power sense line 56 an indication of the
      amount of power applied to patient through applicator or probe 13
      relative to the amount of power reflected from the patient.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] The indication provided on power sense line 56 may be
      digitalized and used by microprocessor 21, for example, to detect
      and control a level of applied power, and to record on application
      storage device 52 information related to the actual treatments
      applied to and received by the patient. Such information may then
      be used by a physician or other clinician to assess patient
      treatment compliance and effect. Such treatment information may
      include, for example: the number of treatments applied for a given
      time period; the actual time and date of each treatment; the
      number of attempted treatments; the treatment compliance (i.e.,
      whether the applicator or probe was in place or not during the
      treatment session); and the cumulative dose of a particular
      modulation frequency.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] The level of power applied is preferably controlled to
      cause the specific absorption rate (SAR) of energy absorbed by the
      patient to be from 1 microWatt per kilogram of tissue to 50 Watts
      per kilogram of tissue. Preferably, the power level is controlled
      to cause an SAR of from 100 microwatts per kilogram of tissue to
      10 Watts per kilogram of tissue. Most preferably, the power level
      is controlled to cause an SAR of from 1 milliWatt per kilogram of
      tissue to 100 milliWatts per kilogram of tissue. These SARs may be
      in any tissue of the patient, but are preferably in the tissue of
      the central nervous system.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] System 11 also includes powering circuitry including
      battery and charger circuit 57 and battery voltage change detector
      58.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] The RF carrier oscillator 32 produces a Radio Frequency
      (RF) carrier frequency of 27 MHz. Other embodiments of the
      invention contemplate RF carrier frequencies of 48 MHz, 433 MHz or
      900 MHz. In general, the RF carrier frequency produced by carrier
      oscillator 32 has spectral frequency components less than 1 GHz
      and preferably between 1 MHz and 916 MHz (which is the upper limit
      of the European 900 MHz band). Although the disclosed embodiment
      contemplates that once set, the carrier oscillator frequency
      remains substantially constant, the carrier frequency produced by
      carrier oscillator 32 may be variable and controllable by
      microprocessor 21 by use of stored or transmitted control
      information.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] Carrier oscillator 32 produces on carrier signal line 36 a
      carrier signal which is then modulated by the modulation signal
      carried on signal line 37.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] Oscillator disable line 33 enables microprocessor 21 to
      disable the signal from oscillator 32 by applying an appropriate
      disable signal to oscillator disable line 33.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] The output of the AM modulator and power generator 34
      appears on signal line 38. This modulated signal is applied
      through emitter output filter 39 which substantially reduces or
      eliminates the carrier harmonics resulting from side effects of
      the modulator and power generator circuit 34.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] The output of the AM modulator and power generator 34 and
      emitter output filter 39 may be designed to possess a 50 Ohm
      output impedance to match a 50 Ohm impedance of coaxial cable 12.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] It has been determined through impedance measurements that
      when a probe 13 is applied within the mouth of a subject, the
      probe/subject combination exhibits a complex impedance of the
      order of 150+j200 Ohms. Impedance transformer 14 serves to match
      this complex impedance with the 50 Ohm impedance of coaxial cable
      12 and therefore the output impedance of the AM modulator 34 and
      output filter 39. This promotes power transmission, and minimizes
      reflections.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] The arrangement described above has been optimized for a
      contact probe with coupling to the mucosa of the mouth. In a
      further example, a conductive, isolated probe has been used at a
      frequency around 433 MHz coupling to the outer ear channel. Due to
      the different probe design in such a frequency band and with this
      coupling method, the values of matching elements (79 and 81
      described in EP 0592 851 B1 ) would be different or could even be
      omitted. Applicator or probe 13 may then be regarded as a
      capacitive coupler or as an antenna matched to the capacitive
      load.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] As described in EP 0 592 851 B1 , with reference to the
      flow charts of FIGS. 11 a-d, microprocessor 21 may operate to
      analyse the signal appearing on power sense line 56 to determine
      and control the amount of power applied to the patient, and to
      assess patient treatment compliance, and possibly to record
      indicia of the patient treatment compliance on application storage
      device 52 for later analysis and assessment by a physician or
      other clinician.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] Exemplary of treatments performed on patients have included
      breast, ovary, pancreas and liver tumour types. The treatments
      involved applying a 27.12 MHz RF signal, amplitude modulated at
      specifically defined frequencies ranging from 0.2 to 23,000 Hz at
      very high precision and stability.<br>

      [0058] Background: In vitrostudies suggest that low levels of
      amplitude-modulated electromagnetic fields may modify cell growth.
      We have identified specific frequencies that may block cancer cell
      growth. We have developed the THERABIONIC device, a portable and
      programmable device delivering low levels of amplitude-modulated
      electromagnetic fields. The device emits a 27.12 MHz
      radiofrequency signal, amplitude-modulated at cancer-specific
      frequencies ranging from 0.2 to 23,000 Hz with high precision. The
      device is connected to a spoon-like coupler, which is placed in
      the patient's mouth during treatment.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] Methods: We conducted a phase I study consisting of three
      daily 40 min treatments. From March 2004 to September 2006, 24
      patients with advanced solid tumors were enrolled. The median age
      was 57.0 12.2 years. 16 patients were female. As of January 2007,
      5 patients are still on therapy, 13 patients died of tumor
      progression, 2 patients are lost to follow-up and one patient
      withdrew consent. The most common tumor types were breast (7),
      ovary (5) and pancreas (3). 22 patients had received prior
      systemic therapy and 16 had documented tumor progression prior to
      study entry.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] Results: The median duration of therapy was 15.7 19.9 weeks
      (range: 0.4-72.0 weeks). There were no NCI grade 2, 3 or 4
      toxicities. Three patients experienced grade 1 fatigue during and
      immediately after treatment. 12 patients reported severe pain
      prior to study entry. Two of them reported significant pain relief
      with THERABIONIC treatment. Objective response could be assessed
      in 13 patients, 6 of whom also had elevated tumor markers. 6
      additional patients could only be assessed by tumor markers. Among
      patients with progressive disease at study entry, one had a
      partial response for &gt; 14.4 weeks associated with &gt; 50%
      decrease in CEA, CA 125 and CA 15-3 (previously untreated
      metastatic breast cancer); one patient had stable disease for 34.6
      weeks (add info); one patient had a 50% decrease in CA 19-9 for
      12.4 weeks (recurrent pancreatic cancer). Among patients with
      stable disease at enrollment, four patients maintained stable
      disease for 17.0, &gt; 19.4, 30.4 and &gt; 63.4 weeks.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] Conclusions: THERABIONIC is a safe and promising novel
      treatment modality for advanced cancer. A phase II study and
      molecular studies are ongoing to confirm those results.<br>

      [0063] Background : Phase I data suggest that low levels of
      electromagnetic fields amplitude-modulated at specific frequencies
      administered intrabucally with the THERABIONIC device are a safe
      and potentially effective treatment for advanced cancer. The
      device emits a 27.12 MHz RF signal, amplitude-modulated with
      cancer-specific frequencies ranging from 0.2 to 23,000 Hz with
      high precision. The device is connected to a spoon-like coupler
      placed in the patient's mouth during treatment. Patients with
      advanced HCC and limited therapeutic options were offered
      treatment with a combination of HCC-specific frequencies.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] Methods: From October 2005 to October 2006, 38 patients
      with advanced HCC were recruited in a phase II study. The patients
      received three daily 40 min treatments until disease progression
      or death. The median age was 64.0 14.2 years. 32 patients were
      male and 29 patients had documented progression of disease (POD)
      prior to study entry.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] Results: As of January 2007, 12 patients are still on
      therapy, 20 patients died of tumor progression, 2 patients are
      lost to follow-up and 3 patients withdrew consent. 27 patients are
      eligible for response. The overall objective response rate as
      defined by partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) in
      patients with documented POD at study entry was 31.6%: 3 PR and 9
      SD. The median survival was 20.7 weeks with a median duration of
      therapy of 17.5 weeks. 13 patients have received therapy for more
      than six months. The median duration of response is 12.9 weeks. 12
      patients reported pain at study entry: 8 of them (66%) experienced
      decreased pain during treatment. There were no NCI grade 2/3/4
      toxicities. One patient developed grade 1 mucositis and grade 1
      fatigue.<br>

      a safe and effective novel therapeutic option, which has antitumor
      effect and provides pain relief in the majority of patients.<br>

      [0066] The electronic device of the present invention, comprising
      means for the accurate control over the frequencies and stability
      of amplitude modulations of a high frequency carrier signal,
      provides a safe and promising novel treatment modality for the
      treatment of patients suffering from various types of advanced
      forms of cancer.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The invention relates to systems and methods for applying low
      energy emission therapy for the treatment of central nervous
      system disorders.<br>
      <br>
      Low energy emission therapy involving application of low energy
      electromagnetic emissions to a patient has been found to be an
      effective mode of treating a patient suffering from central
      nervous system (CNS) disorders such as generalized anxiety
      disorders, panic disorders, sleep disorders including insomnia,
      circadian rhythm disorders such as delayed sleep, psychiatric
      disorders such as depression, obsessive compulsive disorders,
      disorders resulting from substance abuse, sociopathy, post
      traumatic stress disorders or other disorders of the central
      nervous system. Apparatus and methods for carrying out such
      treatment are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,649,935 and 4,765,322,
      assigned to the same assignee as the present application, the
      disclosures of which are expressly incorporated herein by
      reference. Since the time of these earlier disclosures, a
      substantially greater understanding of the mechanisms of the
      treatment and how to secure best results has been gained, which
      has led to important developments being made to the apparatus
      (herein described as a system).<br>
      <br>
      Although the apparatus and methods described in the above patents
      have provided satisfactory results in many cases, consistency and
      significance of results has sometimes been lacking. Also, it was
      not always possible to properly control or monitor the duration of
      treatment or the quantities or nature of the low energy emissions
      being applied to the patient. Furthermore, the efficiency of
      transfer of the low energy emissions to the patient was limited
      and was affected by such factors as patient movement, outside
      interference and the like.<br>
      <br>
      Another limitation of the previously described apparatus is that
      it is not very amenable to ready marketing by marketing
      organizations specifically of the nature comprised in the
      pharmaceutical industry. The apparatus is intended for therapy or
      treatment of patients and the low energy emissions applied to the
      patient are akin to pharmaceutical medication. The marketing
      organization of a pharmaceutical industry should thus be placed in
      a position to market the therapy in a fashion not widely different
      from the fashion in which pharmaceutical products are marketed,
      e.g., through pharmacists, with or without a doctor's
      prescription.<br>
      <br>
      Research on treatment for insomnia has lagged behind other medical
      research programs. Current treatment methods for insomnia consist
      either of hypnotics, behavioral therapies (e.g. biofeedback), or
      of the use of drug agents, specifically benzodiazepines or
      imidazopyridines. Tolerance, dependence, memory loss, and lack of
      efficacy in long-term treatment are among the most common
      drawbacks of these classes of currently available hypnotics.<br>
      <br>
      Research throughout the past two decades has shown clearly that
      the brain serves not only as a communication link and
      thought-processing organ, but also as the source of significant
      chemical activity, as well as a number of bioactive compounds.
      Many of these neurotransmitter compounds and ions are secreted
      following chemical or electrical stimuli. Research has also shown
      that some of these neuroactive compounds are involved in the
      regulation of sleep and wake cycles (Koella, "The Organization and
      Regulation of Sleep," Experientia, 1984; 40(4): 309-408).<br>
      <br>
      During the 1970s, Adey and his group demonstrated that weak
      electromagnetic fields, modulated at certain well-defined low
      frequencies, were able to modify the release of ions (calcium) and
      neurotransmitters (GABA) in the brain (Kaczmarek and Adey, "The
      Eflux of @45 Ca@2+ and [@3 H]y-aminobutyric Acid from Cat Cerebral
      Cortex," Brain Research, 1973; 63:331-342; Kaczmarek and Adey,
      "Weak Electronic Gradients Change Ionic and Transmitter Fluxes in
      Cortex," Brain Research, 1974; 66:537-540; Bawin et al., "Ionic
      Factors in Release of @45 Ca@2+ From Chicken Cerebral Tissue by
      Electromagnetic Fields," Proceedings of the National Academy of
      Science, 1978; 75(12):6314-6318). In these experiments the cortex
      of anaesthetized cats was initially incubated with radio-labeled
      calcium and radio-labeled GABA. When the cortex was exposed to
      continuous stimulation by weak electric fields modulated at 200
      Hz, the researchers found a 1.29-fold increase in Ca++ and a
      1.21-fold increase in GABA release (Kaczmarek and Adey, Brain
      Research, 1973; 63:331-342). Interestingly, the release of GABA
      happened in parallel with the release of Ca++, suggesting that the
      two phenomena are closely linked. The findings of increased Ca++
      release from brain tissue upon stimulation with modulated
      electromagnetic fields have been replicated (Dutta et al.,
      "Microwave Radiation Induced Calcium Ions Effused from Human
      Neuroblastoma Cells in Culture," Bioelectromagnetics, 1984;
      5(1):71-78; and Blackman et al., "Influence of Electromagnetic
      Fields on the Efflux of Calcium Ions from Brain Tissue in Vitro,"
      Bioelectromagnetics, 1988; 9:215-227). It now has become an
      established fact that weak electric fields modulated at certain
      low frequencies are able to modulate the release of Ca++ and GABA.<br>
      <br>
      During 1983, it was discovered that weak electromagnetic fields,
      modulated at low frequencies and delivered by means of an antenna
      placed in the buccal cavity, caused changes in EEG readings in
      human volunteers. In agreement with the findings of Adey and
      Blackman, it was found that only certain well-defined low
      frequency modulations of a standard carrier frequency (27 MHz),
      emitted with a well-defined intensity, were capable of eliciting
      EEG changes.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The present invention has rendered feasible an entirely new
      approach to treatment of a patient described in our said earlier
      patents while avoiding the above-noted drawbacks.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention contemplates provision in the system
      (apparatus) of an interface for an application storage device,
      which application storage device can comprise storage media, such
      as, magnetic storage media, semiconductor memory storage media,
      optical memory storage media, or mechanical storage media. The
      selected storage media is programmed to carry various control
      information. Other information which may be stored in the storage
      media includes duration control information which would control
      the duration of the low energy electromagnetic emission and hence
      the duration of the application of the emission to the patient.
      Further control information can include duty cycle control
      information which would control the emissions, for example, in
      such a fashion that the low energy emission is alternately
      discontinued and re-initiated for chosen periods of time. Yet
      further control information which may be programmed into the
      storage media includes selecting information which would select
      emissions of various different modulation waveforms and
      frequencies which emissions can be emitted sequentially, with or
      without pauses between the emissions. Still further control
      information that may be programmed into the storage media includes
      power level control information.<br>
      <br>
      In one embodiment of the invention, the system includes a
      microprocessor into which is loaded control information from the
      application storage device. The microprocessor then controls the
      function of the system to produce the desired therapeutic
      emission.<br>
      <br>
      Another embodiment of the present invention contemplates that the
      application storage device would be combined into a single unit,
      and would be connected to the system through an interface in order
      to control the system.<br>
      <br>
      In either of these embodiments, the present invention contemplates
      that the interface may include a communications channel such as,
      for example, a radio frequency link or telephone line, which
      connects the application storage device to the rest of the system.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention also contemplates provision in the system of
      an impedance transformer connected intermediate the emitter of low
      energy electromagnetic emissions and a probe for applying the
      emissions to the patient, which impedance transformer
      substantially matches the impedance of the patient seen from the
      emitter circuit with the impedance of the output of the emitter
      circuit.<br>
      <br>
      Another aspect of the present invention is the provision of a
      power reflectance detector which detects an amount of power
      applied to a patient and compares that amount to an amount of
      power emitted by the system. The power detector permits the
      monitoring of patient compliance with the prescribed treatment.
      Such patient treatment compliance information may be stored on the
      application storage device for later retrieval and analysis. For
      example, the power detector may be used to detect the number of
      treatments applied to a particular patient, and the elapsed time
      for each treatment. Further, the actual time of day of each
      treatment may also be recorded, as may the number of attempted
      treatments.<br>
      <br>
      These and other features and advantages of the present invention
      will become apparent to those of skill in this art with reference

        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Referring to FIG. 1, presented is a modulated low energy
      electromagnetic emission application system 11, in accordance with
      the present invention. As presented in prior <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,649,935 and
        4,765,322</span>, such a system has proven useful in the
      practice of Low Energy Emission Therapy (LEET, a trademark of the
      assignee of the present application), which involves application
      of emissions of low energy radio frequency (RF) electromagnetic
      waves and which has proven an effective mode of treating a patient
      suffering from central nervous system (CNS) disorders such as, for
      example, generalized anxiety disorders, panic disorders, sleep
      disorders including insomnia, psychiatric disorders such as
      depression, obsessive compulsive disorders, disorders resulting
      from substance abuse, sociopathy, post traumatic stress disorders
      or other disorders of the central nervous system. The system
      includes a probe or mouthpiece 13 which is inserted into the mouth
      of a patient under treatment. Probe 13 is connected to an
      electromagnetic energy emitter (see also FIG. 2), through coaxial
      cable 12 and impedance matching transformer 14. Although probe 13
      is illustrated as a mouthpiece, any probe that is adapted to be
      applied to any mucosa may be used. For example, oral, nasal,
      optical, urethral, anal, and/or vaginal probes may be used without
      departing from the scope of the invention. Probes situated closer
      to the brain, for example endonasal or oral probes, are presently
      preferred.<br>
      <br>
      Application system 11 also includes an interface 16 which is
      adapted to receive an application storage device 52 such as, for
      example, magnetic media, semiconductor media, optical media or
      mechanically encoded media, which is programmed with control
      information used to control the operation of system 11 to apply
      the desired type of low energy emission therapy to the patient
      under treatment.<br>
      <br>
      As presented in more detail below, application storage device 52
      can be provided with a microprocessor which, when applied to
      interface 16, operates to control the function of system 11 to
      apply the desired low energy emission therapy. Alternatively,
      application storage device 52 can be provided with a
      microprocessor which is used in combination with microprocessor 21
      within system 11. In such case, the microprocessor within device
      52 could assist in the interfacing of storage device 52 with
      system 11, or could provide security checking functions.<br>
      <br>
      System 11 also includes a display 17 which can display various
      indications of the operation of system 11. In addition, system 11
      includes on and off power buttons 18 and 19.<br>
      <br>
      It will be understood that configurations of application system 11
      other than that presented in FIG. 1, may be used without departing
      from the spirit and scope of the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      Referring now to FIG. 2, presented is a block diagram of the
      electronic circuitry of application system 11, in accordance with
      the present invention. A data processor, such as for example,
      microprocessor 21, operates as the controller for application
      system 11, and is connected to control the various components of
      the system 11 through address bus 22, data bus 23 and I/O lines
      25.<br>
      <br>
      Microprocessor 21 preferably includes internal storage for the
      operation coded control program, and temporary data. In addition,
      microprocessor 21 includes input/output ports and internal timers.
      Microprocessor 21 may be, for example, an 8-bit single-chip
      microcontroller, 8048 or 8051 available from Intel Corporation.<br>
      <br>
      The timing for microprocessor 21 is provided by system clock 24
      which includes a clock crystal 26 along with capacitors 27 and 28.
      System clock 24 may run at any clock frequency suitable for the
      particular type of microprocessor used. In accordance with one
      embodiment of the present invention, system clock 24 operates at a
      clock frequency of 8.0 MHz.<br>
      <br>
      The operating program for microprocessor 21 is presented below in
      flow chart form with reference to FIGS. 11 a-d. In general,
      microprocessor 21 functions to control controllable
      electromagnetic energy generator circuit 29 to produce a desired
      form of modulated low energy electromagnetic emission for
      application to a patient through probe 13.<br>
      <br>
      Controllable generator circuit 29 includes modulation frequency
      generator circuit 31 and carrier signal oscillator 32.
      Microprocessor 21 operates to activate or de-activate controllable
      generator circuit 29 through oscillator disable line 33, as
      described below in more detail. Controllable generator circuit 29
      also includes an AM modulator and power generator 34 which
      operates to amplitude modulate a carrier signal produced by
      carrier oscillator 32 on carrier signal line 36, with a modulation
      signal produced by modulation signal generator circuit 31 on
      modulation signal line 37.<br>
      <br>
      Modulator 34 produces an amplitude moduated carrier signal on
      modulated carrier signal line 38, which is then applied to the
      filter circuit 39. The filter circuit 39 is connected to probe 13
      via coaxial cable 12 and impedance transformer 14.<br>
      <br>
      Microprocessor 21 controls modulation signal generator circuit 31
      of controllable generator circuit 29 through address bus 22, data
      bus 23 and I/O lines 25. In particular, microprocessor 21 selects
      the desired waveform stored in modulation waveform storage device
      43 via I/O lines 25. Microprocessor 21 also controls waveform
      address generator 41 to produce on waveform address bus 42 a
      sequence of addresses which are applied to modulation signal
      storage device 43 in order to retrieve the selected modulation
      signal. The desired modulation signal is retrieved from modulation
      signal storage device 43 and applied to modulation signal bus 44
      in digital form. Modulation signal bus 44 is applied to digital to
      analog converter (DAC) 46 which converts the digital modulation
      signal into analog form. This analog modulation signal is then
      applied to selective filter 47 which, under control of
      microprocessor 21, filters the analog modulation signal by use of
      a variable filter network including resistor 48 and capacitors 49
      and 51 in order to smooth the wave form produced by DAC 46 on
      modulation signal line 20.<br>
      <br>
      In the present embodiment, the various modulation signal wave
      forms are stored in modulation signal storage device 43. With a 2
      kilobyte memory, storage device 43 can contain up to 8 different
      modulation signal wave forms. Wave forms that have been
      successfully employed include square wave forms or sinusoidal wave
      forms. Other possible modulation signal wave forms include
      rectified sinusoidal, triangular, and combinations of all of the
      above.<br>
      <br>
      In the present embodiment, each modulation signal wave form uses
      256 bytes of memory and is retrieved from modulation signal
      storage device 43 by running through the 256 consecutive
      addresses. The frequency of the modulation signal is controlled by
      how fast the wave form is retrieved from modulation signal storage
      device 43. In accordance with the present embodiment, this is
      accomplished by downloading a control code from microprocessor 21
      into programmable counters contained within wave form address
      generator 41. The output of the programmable counters then drives
      a ripple counter that generates the sequence of 8-bit addresses on
      the wave form address bus 42.<br>
      <br>
      Wave form address generator 41 may be, for example, a programmable
      timer/counter uPD65042C, available from NEC. Modulation signal
      storage device 43 may be, for example, a type 28C16 Electrical
      Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory (EEPROM) programmed with
      the desired wave form table. Digital to analog converter 46 may
      be, for example, a DAC port, AD557JN available from Analog
      Devices, and selective filter 47 may be a type 4052 multiplexer,
      available from National Semiconductor or Harris Semiconductor.<br>
      <br>
      The particular modulation control information used by
      microprocessor 21 to control the operation of controllable
      generator circuit 29, in accordance with the present invention, is
      stored in application storage device 52. As presented below in
      more detail with reference to FIGS. 12, 13, 14 and 15, application
      storage device 52 may be any storage device capable of storing
      information for later retrieval. For example, application storage
      device 52 may be, for example, a magnetic media based storage
      device such as a card, tape, disk, or drum. Alternatively,
      application storage device 52 may be a semiconductor memory-based
      storage device such as an erasable programmable read only memory
      (EPROM), an electrical erasable programmable read only memory
      (EEPROM) or a non-volatile random access memory (RAM). Another
      alternative for application storage device 52 is a mechanical
      information storage device such as a punched card, cam, or the
      like. Yet another alternative for application storage device 52 is
      an optical storage device such as a compact disk read only memory
      (CD ROM).<br>
      <br>
      It should be emphasized that although the figures illustrate
      microprocessor 21 separate from .application storage device 52,
      microprocessor 21 and application storage device 52 may both be
      incorporated into a single device, which is loaded into system 11
      to control the operation of system 11 as described herein. In this
      case, interface 16 would exist between the combination of
      microprocessor 21 and application storage device 52 and the rest
      of system 11.<br>
      <br>
      Interface 16 is configured as appropriate for the particular
      application storage device 52 in use. Interface 16 translates the
      control information stored in application storage device 52 into a
      usable form for storage within the memory of microprocessor 21 to
      enable microprocessor 21 to control controllable generator circuit
      29 to produce the desired modulated low energy emission.<br>
      <br>
      Interface 16 may directly read the information stored on
      application storage device 52, or it may read the information
      through use of various known communications links. For example,
      radio frequency, microwave, telephone or optical based
      communications links may be used to transfer information between
      interface 16 and application storage device 52.<br>
      <br>
      When application storage device 52 and microprocessor 21 are
      incorporated in the same device, interface 16 is configured to
      connect microprocessor 21 to the rest of system 11.<br>
      <br>
      The control information stored in application storage device 52
      specifies various controllable parameters of the modulated low
      energy RF electromagnetic emission which is applied to a patient
      through probe 13. Such controllable parameters include, for
      example, the frequency and amplitude of the carrier, the
      amplitudes and frequencies of the modulation of the carrier, the
      duration of the emission, the power level of the emission, the
      duty cycle of the emission (i.e., the ratio of on time to off time
      of pulsed emissions applied during an application), the sequence
      of application of different modulation frequencies for a
      particular application, and the total number of treatments and
      duration of each treatment prescribed for a particular patient.<br>
      <br>
      For example, the carrier signal and modulation signal may be
      selected to drive the probe 13 with an amplitude modulated signal
      in which the carrier signal includes spectral frequency components
      below 1 GHz, and preferably between 1 MHz and 900 Mhz, and in
      which the modulation signal comprises spectral frequency
      components between 0.1 Hz and 10 KHz, and preferably between 1 Hz
      and 1000 Hz. In accordance with the present invention, one or more
      modulation frequencies may be sequenced to form the modulation
      signal.<br>
      <br>
      As an additional feature, an electromagnetic emission sensor 53
      may be provided to detect the presence of electromagnetic
      emissions at the frequency of the carrier oscillator 32. Emission
      sensor 53 provides to microprocessor 21 an indication of whether
      or not electromagnetic emission at the desired frequency are
      present. As described below in more detail, microprocessor 21 then
      takes appropriate action, for example, displaying an error message
      on display 17, disabling controllable generator circuit 29, or the
      like.<br>
      <br>
      The invention also includes a power sensor 54 which detects the
      amount of power applied to the patient through probe 13 compared
      to the amount of power returned or reflected from the patient.
      This ratio is indicative of the proper use of the system during a
      therapeutic session. Power sensor 54 applies to microprocessor 21
      through power sense line 56 an indication of the amount of power
      applied to patient through probe 13 relative to the amount of
      power reflected from the patient.<br>
      <br>
      The indication provided on power sense line 56 may be digitized
      and used by microprocessor 21, for example, to detect and control
      a level of applied power, and to record on application storage
      device 52 information related to the actual treatments applied.
      Such information may then be used by a physician or other
      clinician to assess patient treatment compliance and effect. Such
      treatment information may include, for example: the number of
      treatments applied for a given time period; the actual time and
      date of each treatment; the number of attempted treatments; the
      treatment compliance (i.e., whether the probe was in place or not
      in place during the treatment session); and the cumulative dose of
      a particular modulation frequency.<br>
      <br>
      The level of power applied is preferably controlled to cause the
      specific absorption rate (SAR) of energy absorbed by the patient
      to be from 1 microWatt per kilogram of tissue to 50 Watts per
      kilogram of tissue. Preferably, the power level is controlled to
      cause an SAR of from 100 microWatts per kilogram of tissue to 10
      Watts per kilogram of tissue. Most preferably, the power level is
      controlled to cause an SAR of from 1 milliWatt per kilogram of
      tissue to 100 milliWatts per kilogram of tissue. These SARs may be
      in any tissue of the patient, but are preferably in the tissue of
      the central nervous system.<br>
      <br>
      System 11 also includes powering circuitry including battery and
      charger circuit 57 and battery voltage change detector 58.<br>
      <br>
      FIGS. 3-10 present in more detail various components of the system
      of FIG. 2.<br>
      <br>
      Referring first to FIG. 3, presented is a detailed schematic of
      controllable modulation frequency generator 31. Modulation
      frequency generator 31 includes wave form address generator 41,
      modulation signal storage device 43, digital to analog converter
      46 and a selective filter network 47.<br>
      <br>
      Microprocessor 21 controls extended I/O lines 45 and selects the
      desired wave form from wave form storage device 43. Microprocessor
      21 then downloads the control information to the wave form address
      generator 41 which in turn generates a sequence of the wave form
      addresses. The sequence of addresses are then applied to the
      modulation signal storage device 43 through address bus 42. The
      desired modulation signal is then retrieved from the storage
      device 43 and appears on signal bus 44 in digital form. After a
      digital to analog conversion by the digital to analog converter
      46, the modulation signal is filtered and is output onto the
      modulation signal line 20.<br>
      <br>
      The frequency of the modulation signal is determined by the rate
      at which the sequence of wave form addresses is generated. The
      type of modulation signal is selected by microprocessor 21 via
      extended I/O lines 45 and the filtering network is selected via
      I/O line 50.<br>
      <br>
      Referring now to FIG. 4, presented is a detailed schematic of the
      modulation signal buffer amplifier 35 and the carrier frequency
      oscillator circuit 32.<br>
      <br>
      The modulation signal buffer amplifier 35 is basically a
      non-inverting amplifier in discrete form. The amplifier buffers
      the modulation signal 20 from the selective filter 47 and provides
      necessary modulation signal amplitude and current drive to the AM
      modulator and power generator circuit 34. The output stage is
      designed in such a way that the output signal 37 achieves a
      rail-to-rail voltage swing. The output of the modulation signal
      buffer appears on signal line 37.<br>
      <br>
      It should be noted that although the disclosed embodiment
      contemplates that the gain of modulation signal buffer amplifier
      35 is substantially constant, the invention also contemplates use
      of a variable gain amplifier that is controlled by microprocessor
      21 in order to vary the magnitude of the modulation signal on line
      37, thus permitting programmable control of the level of power
      applied.<br>
      <br>
      The carrier oscillator 32 is constructed around carrier oscillator
      crystal 59. In one embodiment, carrier oscillator 32 produces a
      Radio Frequency (RF) carrier frequency of 27 MHz. Other
      embodiments of the invention contemplate RF carrier frequencies of
      48 MHz, 450 MHz or 900 MHz. In general, the RF carrier frequency
      produced by carrier oscillator 32 has spectral frequency
      components less than 1 GHz and preferably between 1 MHz and 900
      MHz. It should also be noted that while the disclosed embodiment
      contemplates that once set, the carrier oscillator frequency
      remains substantially constant, the present invention also
      contemplates that carrier frequency produced by carrier oscillator
      32 is variable and controllable by microprocessor 21 by use of
      control information stored on application storage device 52. This
      would be accomplished, for example, by use of high frequency
      oscillator, the output of which is conditioned by a controllable
      clock divider circuit to produce a controlled carrier frequency
      signal.<br>
      <br>
      Carrier oscillator 32 produces on carrier signal line 36 a carrier
      signal which is to be modulated by the modulation signal carried
      on signal line 37.<br>
      <br>
      Oscillator disable line 33 is applied to NAND gate 61, the output
      of which is applied to NAND gate 62. This configuration allows
      microprocessor 21 to disable both modulation signal buffer 35 and
      carrier oscillator 32 by applying an appropriate disable signal to
      oscillator disable line 33.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 5 presents a detailed schematic of the AM modulator and power
      generator 34 and the output filter 39. The AM modulator is made up
      of two transistors 66 and 67 connected in parallel and operated in
      zero-crossing switching mode. The carrier signal 36 is applied at
      the bases of the transistors 66 and 67 through NAND gates 63 and
      64, and the modulation signal 37 is applied to the collectors of
      transistors 66 and 67 through inductors 68 and 69. The net result
      is the modulated carrier that appears at the collectors of the
      transistors 66 and 67.<br>
      <br>
      The output power is generated by a single-ended tuned resonant
      converters configured by three pairs of inductors and capacitors,
      70, 71 and 72. LC resonant circuits 70, 71 and 72 are tuned to
      provide the required output power and are optimized to the maximum
      efficiency of the converter.<br>
      <br>
      The output of the AM modulator and power generator 34 appears on
      signal line 38. This modulated signal is applied through output
      filter network 39 to output connector 78. Output filter 39
      included three LC filtering stages, 73, 74 and 76.<br>
      <br>
      The first LC filtering stage, 73 is a band-pass and band-notch
      filter with pass band centered at 27 MHz and band notch centered
      at 54 MHz. The band-notch filter provides additional suppression
      to the second harmonic of the carrier. The second and third LC
      filtering stages 74 and 76 are both band pass filters which have
      pass band centered at 27 MHz. The three stage output filter serves
      to substantially eliminate the carrier harmonics that result from
      zero-crossing switching of the AM modulator circuit 34.<br>
      <br>
      The output series resistor 77 is used to adjust the output
      impedance of the modulator. It is found from measurement that the
      output impedance of the AM modulator is considerably lower than 50
      ohm. The series resistor 77 adjusts the output impedance of the
      circuit is approximately 50 ohms.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 6 presents the details of the impedance transformer 14.
      Referring also to FIGS. 1, 2, and 5, the output of the AM
      modulator and power generator 34 and filter stage 39 is designed
      to have a 50 Ohm output impedance which is chosen to match the 50
      Ohm impedance of coaxial cable 12. Impedance transformer 14
      includes inductor 79 connected between probe 1 and the middle
      conductor of coaxial cable 12, and a capacitor 81 connected
      between probe 13 and the ground conductor of coaxial cable 12.<br>
      <br>
      It has been determined through impedance measurements that when
      probe 13 is applied to the mouth of a patient, the probe/patient
      combination exhibits a complex impedance on the order of 150+j200
      Ohms. Impedance transformer 14 serves to match this complex
      impedance with the 50 Ohm impedance of coaxial cable 12 and
      therefore the output impedance of the AM modulator 34 and output
      filter 39. This promotes power transmission, and minimizes
      reflections. In one embodiment, inductor 79 is 0.68 microHenry,
      and capacitor 81 is 47 picoFarads.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 7 presents the detailed schematic of the emission sensor 53
      of the present invention. Emission sensor 53 includes antenna 82
      which is capable of detecting electromagnetic fields at the
      frequency of the carrier oscillator 32. The signal induced by
      antenna 82 is applied to a simple diode detector formed by diode
      83, capacitor 84 and resistor 85. The demodulated low frequency
      signal is then applied to the base of a transistor 86 operating as
      a switch. The output is a low level signal line 87 which is
      connected to microprocessor 21. Emission sensor 53 is used at the
      beginning of a treatment session to detect whether probe 13 is
      emitting electromagnetic fields of the carrier frequency. If so,
      microprocessor 21 produces on display 17 an indication that the
      proper electromagnetic field is being produced.<br>
      <br>
      Emission sensor 53 is also connected to the power supply circuitry
      through EXT DC IN line 115 (see also, FIG. 10). When external dc
      power is applied, line 115, which is connected to the base of
      transistor 86, turns transistor 86 on, thus providing an
      indication to microprocessor 21 that external dc power is applied.<br>
      <br>
      Referring now to FIG. 8, presented is a schematic of the power
      sensor 54 used to sense the ratio of the power applied to the
      patient through probe 13 to the power reflected from the patient.
      This ratio is indicative of the efficiency of power transfer from
      the application system 11 to the patient, and may be used to
      assess patient treatment compliance. Power sensor 54 may also be
      used to monitor the level of power being applied to the patient.<br>
      <br>
      Power sensor 54 includes bi-directional coupler 88 which can be,
      for example, a model KDP-243 bi-directional coupler available from
      Synergy Microwave Corporation. Bi-directional coupler 88 operates
      to couple a portion of the energy emitted by application system 11
      through output connected 78 and carried by coaxial cable 12 into
      detecting circuits 89 and 90.<br>
      <br>
      Output connector 78 is connected to a primary input of
      bi-directional coupler 88 and co-axial cable 12 is connected to a
      primary output of bi-directional coupler 88. Bi-directional
      coupler 88 includes two secondary outputs, each of which are
      connected to respective detecting circuits 89 and 90. Detecting
      circuit 89 functions to detect the amount of power applied to the
      patient, and detecting circuit 90 functions to detect the amount
      of power reflected from the patient. Detecting circuit 89 is
      connected through resistive divider 94 to the positive input of
      differential amplifier 91. Detecting circuit 90 is connected
      through resistive divider 92 to the negative input of differential
      amplifier 91. The output of differential amplifier 91 is
      indicative of the difference between the power transmitted to the
      patient by application system 11, and the power reflected from the
      patient, and thus is indicative of an amount of power absorbed by
      the patient. The output of differential amplifier 91 is applied to
      an analog to digital converter (ADC) or comparator 93, the output
      of which connected to microprocessor 21 through power sense line
      56.<br>
      <br>
      As described in more detail below with reference to the flow chart
      of FIGS. 11 a-d, microprocessor 21 operates to analyze the signal
      appearing on power sense line 56 to determine and control the
      amount of power applied to the patient, and to assess patient
      treatment compliance, and possibly to record indicia of the
      patient treatment compliance on application storage device 52 for
      later analysis and assessment by a physician or other clinician.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 9 presents a detailed schematic of the information output
      circuit 17. Microprocessor 21 controls the display module 109 of
      information output circuit 17 via data bus 23 and address bus 22
      and controls the sound control circuit 110 by an I/O line 100. The
      display module 109 may be an intelligent LED display module
      PD3535, available from Siemens or a LCD graphics module available
      from Epson. The sound control circuit 110 may be a buzzer as shown
      in FIG. 9 or it may be an advanced speech synthesizer.<br>
      <br>
      Referring now to FIG. 10, presented are the details of the power
      supply circuit used in the application system 11 of the present
      invention.<br>
      <br>
      During operation of application system 11, power is derived from
      rechargeable battery 95 which may be, for example, a six volt
      rechargeable Ni--Cd battery, or the like. Battery 95 is connected
      through relay 99 to relay 98. The coil of relay 98 is powered by
      transistor 106 which is controlled by the output of NAND gate 102.<br>
      <br>
      NAND gates 102, 103, 104 and 105 are configured to form a
      resettable latch. When on button 18 is depressed, the latch turns
      on transistor 106 which activates the coil of relay 98. When off
      button 19 is depressed, the latch is reset thus turning transistor
      106 off, and removing power from the coil of relay 98.
      Microprocessor 21 may also reset the latch by pulling low
      momentarily on the Auto-Off line 107. This helps to save
      unnecessary power consumption when the system 11 is being left in
      an idle state.<br>
      <br>
      When the coil of relay 98 is powered, battery 95 is connected to
      voltage regulator 97 which provides regulated voltage Vcc which is
      used to power various components of application system 11.<br>
      <br>
      Connector 96 is provided to accommodate an external ac/dc adapter
      (not shown) which is used to charge battery 95. When an external
      dc adapter is connected to connector 96, voltage regulator 101
      produces a regulated voltage which powers the coil of relay 99.
      This causes battery 95 to be disconnected from voltage regulator
      97, and causes the output of voltage regulator 101 to be connected
      to the input of voltage regulator 97, thus permitting application
      system 11 to be powered by the external dc adapter. An indication
      of the existence of external dc voltage is applied to emission
      sensor 53 (FIG. 7) through EXT DC IN line 115.<br>
      <br>
      If external dc power is connected (determined by emission sensor
      53 when application system 11 is initially powered),
      microprocessor 21 executes the battery charging control routine,
      stops controllable generator 29 and disables the carrier
      oscillator 32. It also sends a signal to the battery charging
      control 57 and turns on the fast charging circuits. A message is
      displayed on display 17 or on a separate light emitting diode
      indicating that the battery is being charged.<br>
      <br>
      During the battery charging routine, microprocessor 21 constantly
      monitors the battery voltage from the -dV detector 58 via data bus
      23. Once the required -dV is detected, Ni--Cd battery 95 has
      reached its full charge condition, microprocessor 21 switches off
      the fast charge circuit and automatically removes power from the
      system 11. -dV detector 58 may be configured, for example,
      including a MAX166 digital to analog converter available from
      Maxim Integrated Products, Inc.<br>
      <br>
      The battery voltage is constantly monitored by the battery voltage
      monitor 108. Once the battery voltage drops to a predetermined low
      level (the voltage level at which the output emission power drops
      by 3% of the calibrated value), a signal is provided to
      microprocessor 21 which in turn stops the emission and provides an
      error message on the display 17. Battery voltage monitor 108 may
      be, for example, a voltage supervisory integrated circuit
      available from Texas Instruments or SGS Thompson.<br>
      <br>
      Referring now to FIGS. 11 a-d, presented are flow charts of the
      operation of the application system 11 of FIGS. 1 and 2, in
      accordance with the method of the present invention. In practice,
      the flowcharts of FIGS. 11 a-d are encoded in an appropriate
      computer program and loaded into the operating program storage
      portion of microprocessor 21 in order to cause microprocessor 21
      to control the function of application system 11.<br>
      <br>
      Referring to FIG. 11a, microprocessor 21 starts execution of the
      program when switch 18 is activated. In block 111, microprocessor
      21 initializes the circuits by stopping the wave form address
      generator 41, disabling the carrier oscillator 32 and displaying a
      welcome message to the user on display module 109.<br>
      <br>
      In block 112, the source of dc power is immediately checked
      afterinitialization. If an external dc power source is connected,
      for example an ac/dc adapter, it is assumed that system 11 should
      function as a Ni--Cd battery charger. Microprocessor 21 passes
      control to block 113 which switches on the fast charge mode of the
      battery charging control 57 and monitors the battery voltage via
      the -dV detector 58 in the control loop including blocks 111 and
      116. Once the Ni-Cd battery 95 reaches its full-charged state as
      detected by -dV detector 58, microprocessor 21 switches off the
      fast charging current in block 117 and automatically switches off
      system 11 in block 118.<br>
      <br>
      If decision block 112 determines that external dc source is not
      connected, system 11 is powered by the internal battery 95. The
      battery voltage monitor 108 monitors the battery voltage at all
      times and provides information to microprocessor 21 for use in
      decision block 119. If the battery level drops to a predetermined
      low level, microprocessor 21 displays an error message on the
      display 109 in block 121. This is to inform the user to re-charge
      the battery before using the system again. It also switches off
      system 11 automatically in block 122 if there is no user response
      as determined by timing loop 123.<br>
      <br>
      Referring now to FIG. 11b, after the battery level is checked,
      microprocessor 21 checks in block 124 if application storage
      device 52 is connected to system 11 via interface 16. If
      application storage device 52 is not connected, microprocessor 21
      prompts for the application storage device 52 via information on
      display 109 in block 126. The application storage device 52 must
      be connected within a predetermined time limit as determined by
      block 127, or microprocessor 21 switches system 11 off in block
      128.<br>
      <br>
      Once block 124 determines that application storage device 52 is in
      place, microprocessor 21 reads an identification code in block 129
      and checks if application storage device 52 is genuine and valid
      in block 131. If not, an error message is displayed in block 132
      and system 11 is switched off after a predetermined time limit.<br>
      <br>
      If a valid application storage device is connected, microprocessor
      21 reads the control information in block 133 and stores the
      control information in the internal RAM area. Application
      information such as the type of treatment may be displayed on
      display 17 in block 134 for user re-confirmation. Microprocessor
      21 then pauses and waits in block 136 for input from the user to
      start the application.<br>
      <br>
      The user starts the application by pressing the on switch 18
      again. Microprocessor 21 generates a test emission in block 137 by
      controlling the controllable generator 29 and prompts the user to
      check the emission with emission sensor 53 in block 138.
      Microprocessor 21 then checks the emission sensor input for the
      indicative signal in block 139. If the emission is not detected
      within a predetermined time limit as determined by block 142,
      microprocessor 21 displays a corresponding error message in block
      143 and switches off system 11 in block 144 after a predetermined
      idle time as determined by block 146.<br>
      <br>
      If the emission is detected within the predetermined time limit
      determined by block 142, control a passes to block 147 where
      microprocessor 21 executes the application software routine shown
      in detail in the flowchart of FIGS. 11d and 11e.<br>
      <br>
      The application software routine takes in the control information,
      interprets the information and controls the controllable generator
      29 to generate the corresponding modulation wave form, frequency,
      power level, duration and duty cycle.<br>
      <br>
      Referring to FIGS. 11d and 11e, microprocessor 21 starts the
      routine by first setting up a total treatment time counter in
      block 151 which keeps tracks of the timing of the actual
      application. It then gets and interprets the first block of
      modulating frequency data in block 152. Then, in block 153 the
      modulation wave form is selected via extended I/O lines 45 and a
      suitable filter network is selected via the extended I/O lines 50.
      Also in block 153, the gain of modulation signal buffer amplifier
      35 is adjusted in accordance with the power level control
      information. In block 154, the modulation frequency is controlled
      via the wave form address generator 41. The emission is then
      enabled by microprocessor 21 in block 156.<br>
      <br>
      In decision block 157, the battery is checked using battery
      voltage monitor 108 to determine whether the battery level is
      acceptable. If not, control passes to block 158 where an
      appropriate error message is displayed. Then, system 11 is shut
      down in block 161 after a delay time determined by decision block
      159.<br>
      <br>
      If, on the other hand, the battery voltage is acceptable, control
      passes to decision block 162 where it is determined whether or not
      application storage device 52 is still inserted in interface 16.
      If not, control passes to decision block 163 where it is
      determined whether a predetermined time has expired without the
      presence of application storage device 52. When the time limit
      expires, control passes to block 164 where an appropriate error
      message is displayed, and eventually system 11 is automatically
      shut down in block 161.<br>
      <br>
      If, on the other hand, decision block 162 determines that
      application storage device 52 is present within interface 16,
      control passes to block 166 where application storage device 52 is
      updated with user compliance information. Control then passes to
      block 167 where the output of power sensor 54 is read. Control
      then passes to block 168 where the output of power sensor 54 is
      assessed to determine a level of power being applied to the
      patient, and to assess whether or not treatment is being
      effectively applied. For example, if sensor 54 determines the
      presence of a large amount of reflected power, this condition may
      possibly be indicative of probe 13 not being properly connected or
      not being properly inserted into the mouth of a patient.<br>
      <br>
      If decision block 168 determines that treatment is not being
      properly applied, control passes to decision block 169 which
      determines whether a predetermined time limit has been exceeded
      without detection of proper treatment. If the time limit is
      exceeded, control passes to block 171 where application storage
      device 52 is updated with information indicative of non-compliance
      with the treatment protocol.<br>
      <br>
      If, on the other hand, decision block 168 determines that the
      treatment it is being properly applied, control passes to block
      172 where it is determined whether the end of the particular
      modulation frequency block being applied has been reached. If not,
      control returns to decision block 157. If, on the other hand,
      decision block 172 determines that the end of the modulation
      frequency block presently being applied has been reached, control
      passes to decision block 173 where it is determined whether the
      end of the treatment time has been reached. If so, control returns
      to block 148 (FIG. 11c). If, on the other hand, decision block 173
      determines that the end of the treatment session has not been
      reached, control passes to block 174 where the next frequency
      block is read from application storage device 52, and control
      returns to block 153 for the continuation of the treatment
      session.<br>
      <br>
      At the end of the application routine, control is returned and the
      microprocessor 21 displays an ending message in block 148 and
      switches system 11 off automatically in block 149.<br>
      <br>
      FIGS. 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 and 17 present exemplary configurations
      for application storage device 52. It should be understood that
      other configurations for application storage device 52 are also
      possible, without departing from the spirit and the scope of the
      present invention.<br>
      <br>
      Referring to FIG. 12, application storage device 52 may comprise a
      magnetically encoded card 181 which includes a magnetically
      recordable portion 182 which stores the above-described control
      information and patient treatment compliance information.<br>
      <br>
      Referring to FIG. 13, application storage device 52 may comprise a
      semiconductor memory 183 which is connected through terminals 184
      to interface 16. Semiconductor memory 183 is used to store the
      above described application control information and patient
      treatment compliance information.<br>
      <br>
      Referring now to FIG. 14, application storage device 52 may be in
      the form of a smart card 186 with the semiconductor hidden behind
      the contacts 187. The semiconductor may comprise only the memory
      with some security control logic, or may also include a
      stand-alone microprocessor that assists in communicating with the
      host microprocessor 21 via interface 16.<br>
      <br>
      As shown in FIG. 15, application storage device 52 may take the
      form of a key-shaped structure 188 including semiconductor memory
      189 and microprocessor 191 which are operatively connected to
      electrical terminals 192.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 16 illustrates application storage device 52 in the form of a
      compact disk read only memory (CDROM) 193, on which control
      information is optically encoded.<br>

      Finally, as shown in FIG. 17, application storage device 52 may
      take the form of a punched card 194, in which control information
      is tangibly embodied in a pattern of punched holes 196.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">TREATMENT EXAMPLES</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The system of the invention for applying a modulated low-energy
      electromagnetic emission to a patient, is useful for the treatment
      of a patient suffering from central nervous system (CNS)
      disorders. In use of the system, the probe for applying the
      modulated carrier signal to the patient is connected to the
      patient, in particular by means of a mouth piece probe placed in
      the patient's mouth and the modulated low-energy electromagnetic
      emission is applied to the patient through the probe. At least two
      low-energy electromagnetic emissions modulated at different
      frequencies are applied to the patient to achieve beneficial
      results. Beneficially, several discrete electromagnetic emissions
      modulated at different frequencies are applied to the patient for
      a specific treatment of a CNS disorder. The time of treatment,
      which relates to the amount of the low-energy electromagnetic
      emission applied to the patient, may vary between wide limits
      depending on the nature of the disorder being treated and the
      effect desired. However, in general, the time of treatment would
      be at least one minute per day and could continue over several
      hours per day, but would normally be at most one hour per day.
      Most preferably, the treatment time is at least ten minutes per
      day which may be divided up into two or more application times,
      e.g., of from five to forty-five minutes per application time.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">TREATMENT OF INSOMNIA</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      One of the specific CNS disorders which has been very
      satisfactorily treated with the aid of the system of the invention
      is sleep disorder, in particular insomnia which is the most
      important sleep disorder. Clinical insomnia is defined by the
      Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-III-R),
      from the American Psychiatric Association 1987 (DSM-III-R):<br>
      <br>
      "Diagnostic criteria for Insomnia Disorders<br>
      A. The predominant complaint is of difficulty in initiating or
      maintaining sleep, or of non restorative sleep (sleep that is
      apparently adequate in amount, but leaves the person feeling
      unrested).<br>
      B. The disturbance in A occurs at least three times a week for at
      least one month and is sufficiently severe to result in either a
      complaint of significant daytime fatigue or the observation by
      others of some symptom that is attributable to the sleep
      disturbance, e.g., irritability or impaired daytime functioning.<br>
      C. Occurrence not exclusively during the course of "Sleep-Wake
      Schedule Disorder or a Parasomnia."<br>
      <br>
      "Diagnostic criteria for 307.42 Primary Insomnia<br>
      Insomnia Disorder, as defined by criteria A, B and C above, that
      apparently is not maintained by any other mental disorder or any
      known organic factor, such as a physical disorder, a Psychoactive
      Substance Use Disorder, or a medication."<br>
      <br>
      The frequencies of modulation for the low-energy electromagnetic
      emissions applied to the patient for treating insomnia have been
      found to be effective when comprising two or more frequency
      modulations selected from the following bandwidths: 1-5 Hz, 21-24
      Hz, 40-50 Hz, 100-110 Hz, or 175-200 Hz.<br>
      <br>
      A very specific example of a set of low-energy electromagnetic
      emissions applied to a patient suffering from insomnia are
      modulated at the following frequencies and applied sequentially to
      the patient for the times indicated over a period of 20 minutes
      per day, three times a week or every day is as follows:<br>
      Protocol P40: about 2.7 Hz for about 6 seconds, followed by about
      a 1 second pause, about 21.9 Hz for about 4 seconds, followed by
      about a 1 second pause, about 42.7 Hz for about 3 seconds,
      followed by about a 1 second pause, about 48.9 Hz for about 3
      seconds, followed by about a 1 second pause.<br>
      <br>
      A study employing the above protocol P40 set of frequency
      modulations and times of application was performed to test the
      efficacy of low-energy emission therapy (LEET) in the treatment of
      insomnia.<br>

      The primary endpoints of the study were defined as measures of
      sleep (total sleep time (TST) and sleep latency (SL)) as measured
      by polysomnography (PSG). Secondary endpoints (also quantified by
      PSG) included measures of rapid eye movement (REM), non-REM,
      number of awakenings after sleep onset, and wake after sleep onset
      (WASO). Additional measures of individual responses to treatment
      were derived from the patients' reports.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">METHODS:</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The study was a placebo-controlled, double-blind,
      repeated-measures study performed on a total of thirty subjects.
      Treatment was provided via a 12 V battery-powered device in
      accordance with the present invention, emanating the P40 protocol.<br>
      <br>
      Forty-six subjects underwent polysomnographic (PSG) evaluation in
      order to yield the thirty subjects who participated in the study.
      The subjects who met the PSG criteria were randomized to treatment
      groups by means of a coin flip. All 30 subject completed the
      study. Subjects were identified for potential enrollment via
      television and radio advertisement.<br>
      <br>
      Each study subject completed a number of rating scales prior to
      entry into and throughout the study. These scales included the
      Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS), the Profile of Mood States
      (POMS), the Hopkins Symptom Check List (HSCL), and a patient
      reported sleep rating scale. The HARS, POMS, and HSCL were
      obtained during the initial psychiatric screening prior to entry,
      on a weekly basis thereafter, and at completion of the study.
      Daily sleep logs were maintained by patients throughout the study.
      Patients received treatment 3 times per week over the 4 weeks of
      the study, and were randomly assigned to either active or inactive
      treatment groups, under double-blind conditions. Treatment was
      performed with patients in a supine position, resting comfortably
      on a bed in a sleep-recording room with a low level of
      illumination.<br>

      To qualify for a baseline PSG study, subjects were screened for
      chronic insomnia of a non-medical etiology. Patients with active
      medical illness, psychiatric diagnoses (DSM-III-R), alcohol/drug
      addiction, or active use of benzodiazepines and/or tranquilizers
      were excluded.<br>
      <br>
      Entry into the study required patients to be suffering from
      chronic insomnia (more than six months) and to meet at least 2 of
      the 3 established PSG sleep criteria: sleep latency of greater
      than 30 minutes duration; total sleep time (TST) of less than 360
      minutes per night; sleep efficiency (total sleep time/total
      recorded time) of less than 85%. Subjects were asked to go to bed
      in the laboratory at their regular bedtime and were allowed to
      sleep "ad libitum". The study was ended by the technician only if
      the time in bed was greater than 8.5 hours and the subject at that
      time was lying in bed awake.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">STATISTICAL METHODS:</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      For purposes of statistical analysis, a Student's t-test was
      performed comparing the difference in the change scores (post-pre)
      between the treatment groups. Where appropriate, analyses were
      adjusted for baseline values using linear regression.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">RESULTS:</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Base Line Evaluation</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Of the 30 consenting, eligible patients, 15 were randomly assigned
      to each of the treatment groups. In the active treatment group,
      there were 4 men and 11 women (mean age of 39 years). In the
      inactive treatment group there were 6 men and 7 women (mean age of
      41 years). The mean age of the subjects did not differ
      significantly between groups.<br>
      <br>
      At baseline, by definition, all patients met criteria for severe
      insomnia. Although the study groups had comparable patient
      reported TST durations at baseline, the placebo group had a
      significantly longer TST at baseline when measured by PSG. Both
      groups had prolonged sleep latency periods at baseline (&gt;20
      mins) as determined by both patient reported and PSG measures.
      Pre-treatment sleep parameters are summarized in Table II.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Post-Treatment Evaluation:
        Interval Changes</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      All 30 patients completed the trial. In the placebo group, the PSG
      TST decreases slightly at the conclusion of the study, compared
      with baseline values (from 337.0.+-.57.2 to 326.0.+-.130.5 TST
      change of -11.0.+-.122.8, p=0.74). Similarly, the pre- and
      post-patient reported measures of TST were nearly identical in the
      placebo group (from 269.0.+-.73.6 to 274.3.+-.103.2, TST change of
      5.+-.122, p=0.87). In contrast, the PSG measured TST increased in
      the active group by nearly 90 minutes (from 265.9.+-.67.5 to
      355.8.+-.103.5, TST increase of 89.9.+-.93.9, p=0.002). This
      finding is consistent with the patient reported improvement
      reported by the active treatment group (from 221.7.+-.112.3 to
      304.0.+-.144.7, TST increase of 82.3.+-.169.0 minutes, p=0.08).<br>
      <br>
      Also worth noting is that, while the proportion of REM sleep in
      the placebo group increased only slightly from 17.3 to 18.7% of
      total sleep time, in the active group, it increased from 16.3 to
      20.9% of the total sleep time. The patient reported measure of
      sleep latency improved by more than 50% in the active treatment
      group during the study (from 145.8.+-.133.2 to 70.7.+-.67.9,
      p=0.03) while sleep latency increased slightly in the placebo
      group during the study period (from 71.3.+-.41.2 to 82.8.+-.84.8,
      p-0.58).<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">CONCLUSIONS:</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Subjects enrolled in this study demonstrated severely disturbed
      sleep criteria by both patient reported and PSG measures. The
      active treatment group exhibited an improvement of 34% in PSG TST,
      while the placebo group demonstrated a 3% decrease in PSG TST. The
      significant difference in TST changes between groups from baseline
      was not explained solely by the significantly different baseline
      TST of the active and placebo groups. Adding the baseline TST in a
      regression model using treatment as a predictor did not adequately
      account for the difference in TST between the treatment groups.<br>
      <br>
      Patient reported measurements confirmed the PSG findings, with a
      37% improvement in the active group TST compared with a 2%
      improvements in the control group. Other PSG and patient reported
      measures of sleep indicated consistently greater improvement in
      the active group compared with the placebo group. Those results
      indicate that LEET therapy (using the P40 program) on an
      every-other-day basis, successfully treats insomnia by both
      lengthening the total duration of sleep and shortening sleep
      latency. Furthermore, patients felt that their sleep patterns were
      improved. Post-treatment sleep parameters are summarized in Table

        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Another double blind, patient-reported study was also designed to
      test the efficiency of low-energy emission therapy (LEET) in the
      treatment of insomnia of non-medical etiology.<br>
      <br>
      The primary PSG of the study was to detect differences between the
      treatment groups in perceived sleep measures (total sleep time and
      sleep latency), as reported by the subjects.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">METHODS:</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The study was preformed on a total of 30 subjects. Treatment was
      provided using the device of the present invention with the P40
      protocol powered by a 12-volt battery. All patients completed all
      phases of the study. In the inactive treatment group there were 8
      males and 7 females (mean age of 40 years). In the active
      treatment group there were 6 males and 9 females (mean age of 39
      years). There were no significant differences in age between the
      active treatment and inactive treatment populations.<br>
      <br>
      Each study subject completed a number of rating scales prior to
      entry into and throughout the study. These scales included the
      Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS), the Profile of Mood States
      (POMS), the Hopkins Symptom Check List (HSCL), and a patient
      reported sleep rating scale. The HARS, POMAS, and HSCL were
      obtained during the initial psychiatric screening prior to entry,
      on a weekly basis thereafter, and at completion of the study.
      Daily patient reported sleep rating scales were maintained by
      patients throughout the study. Patients received treatment 3 times
      per week over the 4 weeks of the study and were randomly assigned
      to either active or inactive treatment groups, under double-blind
      conditions. Treatment was performed with patients in a supine
      position, resting comfortably on a bed in a sleep-recording room
      with a low level of illumination. Subjects continued to record
      sleep log data for two weeks after discontinuation of treatment.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">ENTRY CRITERIA:</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Patients between 20 and 50 years of age were recruited into the
      study. Entry into the study required patients to meet at least 2
      of the 3 established sleep criteria: patient reported sleep
      latency of greater than 30 minutes; patient reported total sleep
      time of less than 360 minutes; and patient reported sleep
      efficiency of less than 85% (calculated as TST/total time in bed).
      Patients with active medical illnesses, psychiatric illnesses
      (according to DSM-III-R), drug or alcohol dependence were
      excluded.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">STATISTICAL METHODS</span>:<br>
      <br>
      For the purposes of statistical analysis, a Student's t-test was
      performed comparing the difference of the change scores (post-pre)
      between each of the treatment groups.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">RESULTS:</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Throughout the course of the study, subjects were asked to
      estimate their total sleep time and sleep latency. A comparison
      was made between the patient reported sleep latency and the
      patient reported total sleep time at the time of the telephone
      interview, and the patient reported sleep latency and patient
      reported total sleep time obtained in the morning following the
      last night of treatment. A highly significant difference was seen
      for total sleep time (two-sided p=0.0021), with a more than
      threefold increase in the active group compared with the placebo
      group. The active treatment group also exhibited a &gt;50%
      decrease in sleep latency as compared with the baseline. Patient
      reports of sleep are summarized in Table IV.<br>

        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Treatment with LEET using a battery powered system is highly
      effective in the treatment of insomnia, based on patient reported
      measurement of total sleep time.<br>
      <br>
      PATIENT REPORTS OF SLEEP: Combined meta-analysis for the above two
      insomnia studies.<br>
      <br>
      A meta-analysis of the patients' reports of sleep from the two
      studies is provided in Table VII. These studies were identical in
      terms of inclusion and exclusion criteria and study design
      (4-week, double-blinded, placebo-controlled). This analysis,
      performed on data from 60 patients (30 per group) demonstrates a
      52 minute decrease in sleep latency, in the active group versus no
      change in the inactive group (p=0,025). Total sleep time increased
      by 128 minutes in the active group versus 28 minutes in the
      placebo group (p=0.005).<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">TREATMENT OF GENERALIZED ANXIETY
        DISORDER AND PANIC ATTACKS</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      As discussed above, several discreet electromagnetic emissions
      modulated at different frequencies are applied to a patient for a
      specific treatment of a CNS disorder. Based on the statistically
      significant improvements in total sleep time and sleep latency
      reported above, a low-energy emission therapy (LEET) program has
      been developed for a further CNS disorder, more closely defined as
      generalized anxiety disorders and panic attacks. For this
      indication, it has been determined that frequency modulations of
      the low-energy electromagnetic emissions should be within the
      following bandwidths: 1-5 Hz, 14-17 Hz, 40-50 Hz, and 175-200 Hz.
      More specifically, a variety of discreet modulations are selected
      from the above bandwidths and are applied for different times, one
      specific example comprising: about 1.4 Hz for about 40 seconds,
      about 2.8 Hz for about 20 seconds, about 3.4 Hz for about 15
      seconds, and a separate group comprising: about 3.4 Hz for about
      15 seconds, about 14.6 Hz for about 4 seconds, about 42.7 Hz for
      about 2 seconds, about 48.9 Hz for about 2 seconds, and about
      189.7 Hz for about 1 second.<br>
      <br>
      For example, the first group of frequencies mentioned may be
      applied to the patient sequentially for a period of about 15
      minutes during the morning of each day of treatment, and the
      second group of frequencies may be applied to the patient
      sequentially for a period of about 30 minutes in the evening of
      each day of treatment.<br>
      <br>
      Results obtained in treating patients suffering from anxiety and
      employing the above dosage criteria are reported below.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">METHODS:</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Subjects were recruited. After obtaining informed consent,
      subjects were .interviewed with the Structured Clinical Interview
      for DSM-III-R Diagnosis (SCID), and symptoms were rated using
      structured interview versions of the Hamilton Anxiety Scale
      (Ham-A) (Hamilton, "The Assessment of Anxiety States by Rating,"
      Br J. Med. Phychol., 32:pp. 50-55, 1959), and the 31 item Hamilton
      Depression Rating Scale (Ham-D) (Hamilton, "A Rating Scale for
      Depression," J. Neurol. Neurosurg. Phychiat., 53:pp. 56-62, 1960).
      A physical examination was performed and blood was drawn from each
      patient for laboratory screening.<br>
      <br>
      Subjects meeting the following requirements were entered into the
      study:<br>
      <br>
      Inclusion criteria:<br>
      1. Age 18-65<br>
      2. Able to give informed consent<br>
      3. Meets DSM-III criteria for Generalized Anxiety Disorder or
      Adjustment Disorder with Anxious Mood for at least three months'
      duration.<br>
      4. Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A) equal or greater than 18<br>
      <br>
      Exclusion criteria:<br>
      1. Meets DSM-III-R criteria for Substance Abuse in past three
      months.<br>
      2. Known contraindication to low intensity magnetic field
      (including pregnant patients or those planning to become pregnant
      in near future)<br>
      3. Meets DSM-III-R criteria for Current Mania, Hypomania, or
      Mixed-Episode Depression, Dysthymia, or Cyclothymia.<br>
      4. History of Panic Disorder, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,
      Schizophrenia,or Schizoaffective Disorder<br>
      5. Acute suicidal ideation at screening interview<br>
      6. Use of anxiolytic medication within one week of screening visit<br>
      7. Dosage of other psychoactive agents not stable during preceding
      12 weeks<br>
      8. Has started new psychotherapy in the preceding six months<br>
      9. Plans to begin new psychotherapy during the course of the study<br>
      <br>
      Subjects were given oral and written instructions for home use of
      the LEET device. Treatment consisted of daily exposures of 15
      minutes each morning and 30 minutes each evening. The devices were
      pre-programmed to provide selected AM frequency RFEM waves via an
      antenna which the subject placed against the roof of their mouths.
      Subject were instructed to use the devices while recumbent with
      their eyes closed. All ratings were performed under open
      conditions. After six weeks of treatment, the devices were
      collected. Patients returned for follow-up visits in the second
      and fourth weeks after discontinuing treatment.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">RESULTS:</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Results are reported for the four women and six men who entered
      the protocol. As Table VIII illustrates, mean Ham-A improved from
      23.4 to 8.1 after the first week of treatment. By the third week
      of treatment, nine of the ten subjects showed improvement on the
      Ham-A of at least 50% of their baseline scores. Improvement was
      generally sustained through the sixth week. After discontinuation,
      the benefit of treatment appeared sustained in some subjects
      through the post-treatment follow-up. Although many subjects
      experienced some increase in Ham-A after discontinuing treatment,
      no subject reported rebound anxiety. Mean scores on Ham-D also
      improved from 15.01 at baseline and remained less than 6 after the
      first week of treatment.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">DISCUSSION:</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The results are noteworthy for several reasons. First, LEET is an
      entirely new treatment paradigm which offers an attractive side
      effect profile and the potential to treat anxiety and related
      disorders. Second, the results are encouraging both in the
      magnitude of the effect and in the percentage of patients who
      achieved a clinically significant improvement. Third, the
      possibility that all instances of observed efficacy are due to
      placebo response is diminished by the duration of the observed
      improvement and that several of the patients had failed to improve
      in prior controlled studies and in previous open treatment with
      high potency benzodiazepines and/or antidepressants. Further
      research under double-blind conditions is indicated to further
      establish the efficacy of LEET and to clarify its role in clinical
      practice.<br>
