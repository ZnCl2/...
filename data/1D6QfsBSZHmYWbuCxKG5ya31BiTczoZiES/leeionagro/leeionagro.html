          SOLAR POWERED PLANT IONIZER</b><br>
        <br>
      </div>
      An air ionizing apparatus for enhancing plant growth that includes
      a housing, solar cells mounted atop the housing, a voltage
      regulator/conditioner circuit coupled to the solar cells, an
      oscillator/modulator circuit coupled to the voltage
      regulator/conditioner circuit, a high voltage converter/multiplier
      circuit coupled to the oscillator/modulator circuit, and an ion
      emitter element coupled to the high/voltage converter/multiplier
      circuit and disposed at the bottom of the housing. Solar energy
      transferred to the solar cells and converted into current is
      converted to high voltage through the voltage/regulator,
      oscillator/modulator, and high voltage converter/multiplier
      circuits. The high voltage is then applied to the ion emitter
      element to produce ions from ambient air in close proximity to a
      plant being treated.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND DISCUSSION OF RELATED ART</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>[0005] 1. Field of the Invention</b><br>
      <br>
      [0006] The present invention relates generally to air ionizing
      devices, and more particularly an air ionizing method and
      apparatus for enhancing and accelerating plant metabolism and
      growth, and still more particularly to a negative ion
      converter/generator that enhances the growth and health of
      land-based plants.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0007] 2. Description of Related Art </b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0008] Land-based plants rely upon light, water, and carbon
      dioxide to affect the process of photosynthesis to convert carbon
      dioxide into organic compounds, particularly sugars.
      Photosynthesis can occur in different ways in different species
      but most features are always the same. The primary rate of
      photosynthesis will vary dependent upon light intensity,
      wavelength, carbon dioxide concentration, and temperature. A less
      recognized additional component, atmospheric ionization, also
      greatly affects this process. Extensive research using sugar cane,
      barley, vegetables and grapes has demonstrated that plant exposure
      to an ionized (charged) atmosphere also affects the metabolic rate
      of plant growth and health. While both positive and negative
      atmospheric ions appear to have a beneficial effect upon plant
      growth, most studies have concluded that negatively charged
      atmospheric ions perform better over a much broader spectrum of
      plant species. Negatively ionized (charged) carbon dioxide
      molecules are more readily absorbed by plants during
      photosynthesis thus increasing the photo-induced charge separation
      process which shuttles electrons through an electron transport
      chain within the organism. The result is faster growth, more
      abundant flora or fruit, and a healthier plant.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] Until recently the application of manufactured atmospheric
      ionization relied upon complex and expensive electronic systems
      which are maintenance intensive and require an external power
      source. With the instant invention, the energy power source is
      photons from the sun. A built in solar panel converts the photons,
      through a sophisticated electronic circuit, to ions for the plant
      during daylight hours which coincides with the natural
      photosynthesis periods for the plants. The resulting molecules of
      atmospheric ions are then available to compliment the
      photosynthesis process as well as plant respiration and absorption
      of water and minerals in the soil. The mild electrical charge
      placed upon the plant by the high voltage ion source also helps to
      mitigate infestation by unwanted herbivores.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0010] The present invention is a solar powered air ionizer for
      enhancing plant metabolism. The inventive apparatus includes, in
      its most essential aspect, includes a sealed and watertight
      housing, a solar cell array disposed atop the housing, and
      circuitry disposed inside the housing for converting current
      generated by the solar cells into a pulsed high voltage discharged
      through an ion emitter. The circuitry includes a voltage
      regulator/converter circuit, an oscillator/modulator, a high
      voltage converter/multiplier, an ion emitter array, a photocell
      for switching the device off at night or in low light conditions,
      a light-emitting status indicator, an alternating current to
      direct current (AC/DC) wall adapter, and a hanger. The housing is
      positioned above a plant and the solar cells are exposed to
      sunlight so that the electrical current thereby generated powers
      the electronic circuitry. Low voltage DC is converted to pulsed
      high voltage or high voltage DC, which is then routed through a
      resistor connected to a high emissivity material having a tip
      which imparts an electrical charge to nearby atmospheric gas
      molecules. The plant takes up the charged gases as part of its
      respiration and metabolic cycles.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] Other novel features which are characteristic of the
      invention, as to organization and method of operation, together
      with further objects and advantages thereof will be better
      understood from the following description considered in connection
      with the accompanying drawing, in which preferred embodiments of

        DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0017] The following detailed description is of the best currently
      contemplated modes of carrying out exemplary embodiments of the
      invention. The description is not to be taken in a limiting sense,
      but is made merely for the purpose of illustrating the general
      principles of the invention, since the scope of the invention is
      best defined by the appended claims.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] Broadly, an embodiment of the present invention generally
      provides a solar-powered device that generates an ionized
      atmosphere above a plant. Conversion of solar energy (photons)
      from low voltage direct current (DC) to a high enough DC pulse
      voltage or to high voltage DC causes ionization of ambient
      molecules of oxygen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and helium. The
      charged atmospheric molecules are then absorbed by the plant and
      increase biological activity, such as increased iron intake during
      plant respiration.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] Referring to FIG. 1, the inventive device 100 may include a
      plastic housing 101 (typically, a watertight sealed assembly
      measuring about 2″×2″×4″), a solar cell array 102 mounted on top
      of the housing, a voltage regulator/converter circuit (see FIGS.
      2-4), an oscillator/modulator (see FIGS. 2-4), a high voltage
      converter/multiplier, an ion emitter array 103, a photocell 104
      for switching the device off during nighttime, a light-emitting
      status indicator 105, an alternating current to direct current (AC
      to DC) wall adapter 106 for indoor use, and a plant hanger and
      wire 107 for mounting the device above a plant 108 being treated.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] Referring next to FIG. 2, the functional elements of the
      inventive apparatus (shown in block diagrammatic form) include a
      solar cell array 201, which serves as the primary voltage source
      to the circuit by converting sunlight to produce a DC voltage
      typically between 3 VDC and 6 VDC, up to 300 ma. Alternatively,
      the voltage source may be provided during indoor use by standard
      120 VAC to 3 VDC-6 VDC wall adapter 202. The selected voltage
      source drives voltage regulator/conditioner circuit 203 which, in
      turn, provides the primary low voltage DC for use by the entire
      electronic circuit assembly.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] Oscillator/modulator 204 receives the low voltage DC, and
      uses it to generate a high frequency source voltage into the input
      of high voltage convertor/multiplier circuit 205. High voltage
      convertor/multiplier circuit 205 converts low voltage high
      frequency energy into a high voltage of 4 kVDC to 9 kVDC in either
      positive or negative polarity. The high voltage is connected to
      ion emitter element 206 (in this example, a tungsten wire). The
      high voltage may then make contact with ambient air molecules via
      corona discharge and either extracts or contributes electrons to
      the air molecules and renders them either positive (cationic) or
      negative (anionic). The plants respond to the charged (ionized)
      molecules during respiration, resulting in increased biological
      activity. Photocell 207 is optional, and when included, if no
      external light source is available, it turns oscillator/modulator
      204 off (eliminating the input to high voltage
      convertor/multiplier circuit 205, and thereby shutting off the
      coronal discharge). Solar cell array 201 may also perform the
      function of photocell 207 by providing sufficiently low voltage
      output when solar cell array 201 is in such darkness or near
      darkness that oscillator/modulator 204 cannot function (again,
      eliminating the input to high voltage convertor/multiplier circuit
      205, and thereby shutting off the coronal discharge). An
      indicator, LED 208, is optionally provided to confirm unit
      operation when exposed to a sufficiently high intensity light
      source or when low voltage DC is provided by a connected wall
      adapter power source.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] Referring now to FIG. 3, a schematic drawing is shown of a
      preferred embodiment of the electronic circuit for converting low
      voltage DC into high voltage for creating a coronal discharge that
      ionizes nearby air molecules. In FIG. 3, it can be seen that
      either solar cell array 201 or standard 120 VAC to 3 VDC-6 VDC
      wall adapter 202 can be connected to power input jack J301 of the
      circuit.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] Input jack J301 passes the low voltage DC to the input side
      of power on-off switch S301. The output side of switch S301 (when
      closed) passes the low voltage DC through ammeter M301. After
      passing through ammeter M301, the low voltage DC is distributed as
      follows:<br>
      <br>
      [0024] Via current-limiting resistor 8301 to light emitting diode
      LED301 (light emitting diode LED301 provides an indication that
      the low voltage DC power is applied to the circuit).<br>
      <br>
      [0025] Via diode D301 to provide power to integrated circuit
      oscillator U301.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] Via the primary winding of transformer T301 to provide
      power to the drain terminal of power MOSFET Q301.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] Capacitors C301 and C302 operate in parallel to filter
      noise from the low voltage DC line.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] The oscillation frequency of integrated circuit oscillator
      U301 is determined by the adjustment settings of variable
      resistors VR301 and VR302 along with the value of capacitor C304.
      Capacitor C305 is configured to keep integrated circuit oscillator
      U301 in a continuous state of oscillation whenever the low voltage
      DC is present.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] The oscillating output signal from integrated circuit
      oscillator U301 is passed through DC isolation capacitor C303, and
      into the gate of power MOSFET Q301. Resistor R302 provides a
      biasing voltage at the gate of power MOSFET Q301. Power MOSFET
      Q301 amplifies the signal provided at its input gate, drawing
      current through the primary winding of transformer T301. This
      signal is inductively coupled to the secondary windings of
      transformer T301, which passes the current into the voltage
      multiplier circuit comprised of diodes D302, D303 and D304 along
      with capacitors C306, C307 and C308. Resistor 8303 passes the high
      voltage output of the voltage multiplier circuit to the ion
      emitter element 206 (seen in FIG. 2).<br>
      <br>
      [0030] When the plant ionizer is powered by the solar cell array,
      ion output can be increased to levels equivalent to those produced
      when operated from the wall adapter power source. This is
      accomplished by connecting the photovoltaic array to the same
      ground return as the electronic circuit, and additionally
      connecting a small gauge external wire tendril 109 of
      approximately 55 centimeters in length to the common ground via
      the AC/DC adapter. The wire dangles from the jack for the wall
      adapter 106 on the outside of housing 101, where it is exposed to
      the atmosphere and may make direct contact with the plant or with
      an earth ground. It reduces space charge built up within and
      around the electronic drive circuitry and broadens the electric
      field around the device to aid in propagating the ions into an
      expanded coverage area.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] Space charges commonly occur near a high voltage connection
      points when gas near the connection point undergoes dielectric
      breakdown, and electrical charges are thereby injected into the
      region near the point forming space charge regions in the
      surrounding gas. Trapped space charges within dielectrics are a
      contributing factor in dielectric failure and reverse biasing of
      solid state electronic components. Due to the high voltage
      generated by the inventive circuit assembly inside the plant
      ionizer housing (FIG. 3), electric charge potentials exceeding 10
      kV exist within the volume of air and coating materials
      encapsulating the circuit assembly. The high voltage charge
      potentials confined to a small area and minimal dielectric form
      space charges which inhibit high voltage multiplier operation and
      pulse drive sources within the circuit. The result is reduced high
      voltage output to the tungsten emitter, which reduces the level of
      ion production when the emitter is exposed to the atmosphere.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] Furthermore, the electric field gradient that serves to
      propagate (distribute) produced ions over a broader area is
      limited by reduced voltage and the relatively small size of the
      plant ionizer internal ground plane. Accordingly, an extension of
      the high voltage circuit ground plane acts to extend the generated
      field while simultaneously bleeding the space charge to an
      external source existing in the immediate area of the device, such
      as earth ground or, more commonly, the atmosphere to earth
      dielectric.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] The solar powered system will then operate similarly to
      when operated with an external DC power source, such as a wall
      adapter, which performs a similar function via it's hard wired
      ground connection to the plant ionizer circuitry.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] To incorporate this feature into the plant ionizer, a very
      small gauge stainless steel stranded wire (28 ga) of approximately
      55 centimeters in length, is connected to the ground side only of
      a female power plug. This very flexible and strong conductor is
      then plugged into the existing male plant ionizer power jack,
      available when operating from a solar power voltage source and not
      from an external (wall adapter) 5 VDC source. The result is that
      the circuit ground plane from the solar array as well as the drive
      circuit assembly is extended into the atmosphere surrounding the
      plant ionizer. The length of 55 cm was selected as the optimum
      length based upon maximum ion production available at drive
      voltage potentials in a range of −8 kV DC to −12 kV DC delivered
      to the tungsten emitter. Many variations of the bleed source wire
      tendril are possible including a reconfiguration the housing
      assembly to something larger and electrically conductive.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] Typical ion production measured 6 inches from the emitter
      without this feature was approximately 1,000,000 ions per cm&lt;3
      &gt;per second. Ion production measured 6 inches from the emitter
      with this feature increased to levels greater than 10,000,000 ions
      per cm&lt;3 &gt;per second.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] In an exemplary use, the article of the present invention
      operates by being positioned above a plant and having the upwardly
      facing solar cell array 201 on the top surface of the housing
      exposed to sunlight. Solar energy is converted to electrical
      energy by the solar cells. The electrical energy then powers the
      electronic circuit, which converts low voltage DC to pulsed high
      voltage or high voltage DC. The high voltage may be routed through
      a current limiting resistor and then connected to a high
      emissivity material, such as pure tungsten wire having a sharp tip
      to impart an electrical charge to nearby atmospheric gas
      molecules. The plant may become mildly charged by virtue of the
      proximity to the ionizing high voltage source. A noticeable
      reduction in the presence of herbivores, such as ants, aphids, and
      ladybugs, has been observed on ionized plants, as compared to
      non-ionized plants.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] An alternative and/or additional use of the device is to
      freshen the breathable air in which humans and animals dwell.
      Negatively ionized air may be beneficial to animals for a variety
      of reasons.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] Negative ionization of atmospheric molecules is the desired
      goal because it has been determined that most plants respond
      favorably to this polarity. Atmospheric ionization at sea level
      may occur at a minimum of approximately 3.5 kV, and the circuit
      may provide 4 kV in most instances, even at dawn and dusk. The
      circuit may increase available high voltage as the sun peaks
      through a daily cycle to produce as much as 9 kV during peak
      sunlight hours, which is concurrent with peak photosynthesis for
      most plants.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] Standard miniature solar panel arrays, such as those used
      in solar powered landscape lighting, may be used to drive an
      electronic circuit designed to step up the voltage to a high
      enough level to ionize air molecules. The ionized air molecules
      may then be placed near virtually any plant to improve metabolic
      activity in the plant, resulting in healthier, faster growth, and
      an increased yield in flowers, vegetables, or fruit.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] The solar cells may be replaced with an external source of
      power such as batteries, AC line voltage, or a HVDC trunk line
      connected to one or many emitter assemblies. While not very
      practical, alternate power sourcing schemes may be used,
      particularly when the plants to be treated are grown indoors. It
      should be understood that the foregoing relates to exemplary
      embodiments of the invention and that modifications may be made
      without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as
      set forth in the following claims.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] For maximum effectiveness, the air ionizer is placed 9 to
      12 inches above the plants receiving treatment. It is raised
      periodically as the plants grow to maintain this distance. The
      effective treatment range of a single air ionizer is approximately
      three square feet from the center of the unit. Care should be
      taken not to allow the emitter located at the bottom of the air
      ionizer to come into direct contact with anything but the air
      around the plant. The unit begins operation as soon as it is
      exposed to sunlight, which may be confirmed by observing a
      flashing green LED light on the side of the unit. The frequency
      and intensity of the flashing green LED varies depending upon the
      intensity of the absorbed sunlight. The air ionizer should be
      positioned to maximize its exposure to sunlight.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] At the center bottom of the air ionizer is a single
      tungsten emitter. This is the high voltage discharge point of the
      device and is responsible for ionizing surrounding air molecules
      by contributing one or more electrons to them. Touching the
      emitter will not harm the unit, but a user may feel a slight
      electrical shock, much like the shock from static discharge when
      touching a door handle after walking on carpet. Thus, it should be
      avoided. While this is a non-lethal voltage source, designed to
      shut off immediately upon contact with anything other than air,
      care should be taken not to touch the emitter or to allow it to
      touch the plant.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] Referring now to FIG. 4, there is shown an alternative
      schematic of a preferred embodiment of the electronic circuit for
      converting low voltage DC into high voltage pulses for creating a
      coronal discharge that ionizes nearby air molecules. In FIG. 4 it
      can be seen that either a photovoltaic power source or a standard
      120/240 VAC to 3 VDC-6 VDC wall adapter can connected to power
      input jack of the circuit.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] Here, input jack J301 passes the low voltage DC 401 to the
      input DCI of the circuit. The low voltage DC is converted into
      high voltage and pulsed as follows: via protection diode D401 and
      current limiting resistor R401. Low voltage input is also from
      solar array 402 and passes through current limiting resistor R402.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] Voltage regulation is provided by Zener diode ZD401 and
      capacitor C401.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] Pulse oscillator circuit 405 comprises transistors Q401,
      Q402, diode D402, Zener diode ZD402, resistors R403, R404, R405,
      and R406, capacitors C402, C403, and C404, and primary transformer
      T401.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] External Flashing LED circuit 410 includes LED401,
      capacitor C405 and resistor R407.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] Four stage high voltage multiplier circuit 420 includes
      capacitors C407, C408, C409 and C410, HV diodes D403, D404, D405,
      and D406 and output limiting resistor R408.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] Pulse repetition frequency may be varied by adjusting value
      of R406 and by varying level of input voltage source.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] The external LED LED401 will flash at a rate consistent
      with pulse repetition frequency and serve as an aid to the user to
      optimize the location of the device for maximum exposure to the
      light source.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] High voltage output consists of a limited pulse train
      having peak voltage levels of −4 KV to −9 KV instead of a constant
      DC output to effect enough voltage to ionize air molecules while
      using a minimum of input current to the circuit (typically less
      than 10 ma).<br>
      <br>
      [0052] When not using a 5 VDC wall adapter as a voltage source and
      using only the solar array as the primary voltage source a single
      conductor 55 cm long stainless steel 28-30 ga stranded wire is
      connected through the power jack to extend the circuit ground
      plane of the circuit traces to the external environmental
      atmosphere of the ion generating circuit.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] For indoor use, the air ionizer generally requires an AC
      wall adapter. When connected it disengages the solar panel and
      serves as the power source for the unit. When using AC current,
      the flashing green LED light on the side of the unit turns on.
      Placement of the unit above the plants being treated indoors is
      the same as in outdoor applications.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] Ion concentrations delivered to the treated plants will
      vary depending upon ambient conditions. To be effective, the unit
      is designed to deliver a minimum of 3,500 ions per cubic
      centimeter per second to the plant area. This is a quantity
      consistent with what is believed to be the optimal “natural”
      environment for plant life. The unit is capable of producing in
      excess of 3,500,000 ions per second. Many of the produced ions
      will be lost due to air currents, distance from the plants, and
      moisture conditions. This is anticipated in the design and will
      not harm the plants at the higher levels while still providing the
      minimum quantity needed in the treated area even under diluted
      conditions. In an outdoor installation, no ions will be produced
      in darkness, and very little will be produced during rainy
      conditions. This is also perfectly normal. The goal is to produce
      the maximum amount of ions for the plant during peak sunlight
      hours, which are also the peak times for photosynthesis.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] Maintenance of air ionizer is minimal, required only to
      keep the unit solar array clean so as to allow as much sunlight as
      possible to strike the solar cells. The emitter wire located at
      the very bottom of the unit may also require periodic cleaning,
      but only after several months of operation. To accomplish this, a
      user simply observes if a white speck of material resembling a
      grain of salt is forming at the tip of the wire element (the white
      speck is actually bonding material extruded from the tungsten
      wire). It may be removed by gently tapping it away with a
      toothpick any other insulated material.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] It will be appreciated that unit longevity can be enhanced
      by encapsulating the electronic components so as to protect them
      from humidity, corrosive chemicals, mechanical shock, large
      temperature variations causing thermal expansion and contraction,
      and other harsh ambient conditions, as well as high voltages from
      the system itself. Such encapsulation can be accomplished using
      any of a number of potting and encapsulation systems, including
      potting in polymeric compounds such as epoxies, silicones,
      polyurethanes, or UV curable systems.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] Unit position around the plants being treated is maintained
      to absorb the maximum amount of sunlight while operating outdoors.
      Guarding against plant foliage growing aggressively towards the
      emitter and coming into physical contact with the emitter is also
      essential, inasmuch as it is quite normal for the plants to grow
      faster in the direction of the ion source (emitter), and some
      diligence must be exercised to rearrange plant foliage and/or unit
      location to avoid this occurrence.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] Walls in close proximity to plants being treated indoors
      may exhibit discoloring after several months of operation. This is
      due to the natural tendency of the ions to clean the air in the
      immediate vicinity through a process of electrostatic
      precipitation. It is recommended that plants be located several
      feet away from walls to avoid this “dirty wall” effect.”<br>
      <br>
      [0059] Thus, it is seen from the foregoing that in its most
      essential aspect, the present invention is an air ionizer for
      enhancing plant growth that includes: a housing; an electric power
      supply to provide low voltage direct current; a power converter
      circuit enclosed in said housing that converts the low voltage
      direct current provided by said power supply to pulsed high
      voltage or high voltage DC power; and an ion emitter tip coupled
      to said power converter circuit and extending from said housing;
      wherein said pulsed high voltage or high voltage direct current
      from said power converter circuit is routed to said ion emitter
      element to produce ionized atmospheric gases in proximity to said
      housing, such that a nearby plant may take up the charged gases as
      part of its respiration and metabolic cycles.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] The foregoing disclosure is sufficient to enable those with
      skill in the relevant art to practice the invention without undue
      experimentation. The disclosure further provides the best mode of
      practicing the invention now contemplated by the inventor.<br>

      &nbsp;<br>
      This invention relates to a combustion air ionization method and
      apparatus for internal combustion engines. In the preferred
      method, combustion air is moved past an electrical charge source.
      A voltage source providing a series of voltage pulses of a single
      polarity ranging from a non-zero base voltage to a predetermined
      peak voltage is connected in a circuit path to the electrical
      charge source. The preferred apparatus practicing this method
      consists essentially of an electrical charge source disposed
      within a container upstream of the engine's combustion air intake.
      The voltage source applies its voltage pulses to the charge
      source, thereby ionizing the air moving past the charge source.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      This invention relates generally to air ionization systems and in
      particular to air ionization systems for use with internal
      combustion engines.<br>
      <br>
      The prior art is replete with inventions designed to increase the
      efficiency of internal combustion engines. Many of these
      inventions have focused on techniques designed to improve the
      mixing of air and fuel.<br>
      <br>
      An ionized mixture of air and fuel mixes more thoroughly, thereby
      improving the fuel's combustion. In addition, most electrostatic
      techniques produce some ozone as a byproduct of the ionization
      process. Ozone reacts more readily with hydrocarbons than oxygen
      does. Furthermore, electrically charged liquid fuel droplets
      resist coalescing into larger droplets, thereby permitting the
      fuel to be mixed more thoroughly with the air.<br>
      <br>
      A number of patents disclose methods and apparatuses for ionizing
      combustion air and/or fuel prior to combustion. Examples are: <b>U.S.



        Pat. No. 1,873,746; U.S. Pat. No. 4,071,004; U.S. Pat. No.
        3,989,017; U.S. Pat. No. 3,963,408; U.S. Pat. No. 3,761,062;
        U.S. Pat. No. 3,476,095; U.S. Pat. No. 3,266,783; and U.S. Pat.
        No. 3,110,294. </b>The disclosures of these patents are
      incorporated herein by reference.<br>
      <br>
      The prior art has recognized, however, that D.C. voltages in
      excess of 5000 volts tend to produce large amounts of ozone. See,
      e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 3,711,743, the disclosure of which is
      incorporated herein by reference. Ozone is very reactive and will
      degrade metal, plastic and rubber components. It is therefore
      necessary in some circumstances to limit the amount of ozone
      produced during ionization of air.<br>
      <br>
      My earlier <b>U.S. Pat. No. 4,789,801</b> disclosed an
      electrokinetic apparatus for ionizing and moving air while
      minimizing the production of ozone and oxides of nitrogen. The
      disclosure of that patent is incorporated herein by reference.
      That patent, however, did not disclose any apparatus or method for
      ionizing combustion air for internal combustion engines.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      One problem with prior art air ionization systems for internal
      combustion engine applications is their high ozone production.
      Because of the degrading effects of ozone, there is a need for a
      method and apparatus for ionizing combustion air for internal
      combustion engines while minimizing ozone production. One object
      of this invention, therefore, is to provide an ionization method
      and apparatus which minimizes ozone production.<br>
      <br>
      Another drawback of prior art devices is their relatively low
      level of ionization. The level of ionization must be maximized in
      order to counteract charge losses to objects downstream of the ion
      generator. A further object of this invention, therefore, is to
      provide an ionization method and apparatus which maximizes ion
      production while minimizing ozone production.<br>
      <br>
      This invention meets these objects by providing a combustion air
      ionization method for internal combustion engines whereby
      combustion air passes by an electrical charge source. A voltage
      source providing a series of voltage pulses of a single polarity
      ranging from a non-zero base voltage to a predetermined peak
      voltage is connected in a circuit path to the electrical charge
      source. The voltage source energizes the charge source to ionize
      the air passing by the charge source.<br>
      <br>
      The preferred apparatus for practicing this method consists
      essentially of an electrical charge source disposed within a
      container upstream of the engine's combustion air intake. The
      voltage source applies its voltage pulses to the charge source,
      thereby ionizing the air moving past the charge source.<br>
      <br>
      The invention is described more particularly below with reference
      to the drawings.<br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</b><br>
      <br>
      The air ionization system according to the preferred embodiment of
      this invention is shown in FIGS. 1 and 2. An ionization tube 10 is
      inserted in the air intake line of an internal combustion engine
      12 upstream of an air cleaner 14. Ionization tube 10 has an inlet
      16 and an outlet 18. Inlet 16 is covered by a screen or grid 20 of
      a suitable non-conducting material, and outlet 18 is covered by a
      similar screen or grid 22. The purpose of the screens is to
      prevent foreign objects from entering the device and to prevent
      any objects from leaving the device and entering the engine's
      carburetor or intake manifold.<br>
      <br>
      Ionization tube 10 is preferably formed from an acrylic
      polycarbonate like Lexan, manufactured by the General Electric
      Company. Alternatively, ionization tube 10 may be made from any
      high dielectric material.<br>
      <br>
      Ionization tube 10 is divided into seven chambers 50, 51, 52, 53,
      54, 56 and 58 by six baffles or rings, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28 and 30.
      As shown in FIG. 2, the diameter of the inner perimeter of rings
      24-30 decreases along the length of ionization tube 10. In
      addition, rings 27, 28 and 30 have a plurality of holes 32 spaced
      substantially uniformly around the rings between the inner and
      outer perimeters thereof. The diameter of the holes 32 increases
      along the length of ionization tube 10. Rings 24-30 are formed
      from the same material as ionization tube 10. The purpose of rings
      24-30 and of holes 32 will be explained below.<br>
      <br>
      Disposed within ionization tube 10 is a charge source consisting
      of a plurality of tungsten filaments 34. As shown in FIGS. 1 and
      2, filaments 34 extend from inlet 16 through rings 24-30 and
      through outlet 18 where they are joined together to form a
      junction 36. The filaments must be thick enough to provide
      sufficient tensile strength and thin enough to provide sufficient
      emissivity. In the preferred embodiment, the charge source
      consists of 12 tungsten filaments which are between 4 and 6 mils
      thick. Figs. 1 and 2 show fewer than 12 filaments for the purpose
      of clarity. Another emissive material may be used in place of
      tungsten filaments 34 and any number of filaments may be used.<br>
      <br>
      An outlet tube 38 is attached to the outlet 18 of ionization tube
      10. Outlet tube 38 leads from ionization tube 10 to air cleaner
      14.<br>
      <br>
      A voltage source 40 is attached to junction 36 via a suitable
      conductor 39. Voltage source 40 supplies a base negative voltage
      of 4.5 kV D.C. Superimposed on this base voltage is a periodic
      voltage pulse of negative 10 kV with a duration of 10 to 40
      microseconds. The shape of the negative voltage pulse is that of a
      half sine wave. The voltage pulse repeats every 60 microseconds,
      i.e., there is a pause of 20 to 50 microseconds between each
      pulse.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 3 is a graphic representation of a typical voltage signal
      curve according to this invention. The voltage signal 102 is
      offset from the zero reference voltage 100 by -4.5 kV. A 30
      microsecond sinusoidal voltage pulse 104 peaks at -14.5 kV. The
      voltage pulse 104 is followed by a pause 106 of 30 microseconds
      where the voltage remains substantially constant at -4.5 kV. The
      cycle repeats every 60 microseconds.<br>
      <br>
      The circuit providing the voltage source is shown schematically in
      FIG. 4. The circuit is basically a single polar or bipolar
      multiplier circuit commonly used in video display terminals
      modified for a 50 percent ripple. While the circuit shown in FIG.
      4 is readily understandable to one of ordinary skill in the art,
      certain elements of the circuit are explained more particularly
      below.<br>
      <br>
      Referring to FIG. 4, an inverter circuit is formed from
      transistors Q1 and Q2 and associated circuitry (i.e., resistors
      R2, R3, R4, and R5) to operate as a conventional D.C. to A.C.
      converter, driving a transformer T1 to convert a D.C. voltage
      (here, a 12-volt supply provided by an automobile battery) to an
      A.C. voltage. The A.C. voltage from the secondary of the
      transformer T1 is converted to a D.C. voltage of approximately 150
      volts by the diode CR1 and by capacitors C1 and C2, and is then
      applied to one terminal of the primary of flyback transformer T2.
      The other terminal receives a negative-going pulsating signal
      which is initiated by an integrated circuit oscillator IC1 and is
      amplified by the transistor circuitry of Q3 and Q4 and associated
      support elements. The secondary of the flyback transformer T2 is
      coupled to a multiplier circuit comprising principally the
      capacitors C8, C9, C10, and C11, interconnected by the diodes CR8,
      CR9, CR10, and CR11. The output of the multiplier circuit produces
      the waveform as shown in FIG. 3. The pulse width of the
      negative-going pulses is selected by adjustment of R15.<br>
      <br>
      In operation, air is drawn into inlet 16 by the negative pressure
      within air cleaner 14. Rings 24-30 create relatively static
      pockets of air within each chamber surrounding and adjacent to
      filaments 34. The holes 32 formed in rings 24-30 help keep the
      airflow through ionization tube 10 laminar.<br>
      <br>
      The modulating negative voltage on filaments 34 ionizes the air in
      chambers 50-58. The negative ions (anions) generated in the
      chambers are entrained by the air moving through the center of
      rings 24-30 and by the air moving through holes 32 in rings 24-30.
      This arrangement and operation of the ionization tube minimizes
      ozone production while maximizing ion production. This apparatus
      has the added benefit of increasing the static pressure of the
      incoming air due to the effect of the ionization process.<br>
      <br>
      The dimensions of the device may be modified to fit the
      application. For a 400 hp 500 cu.in. gasoline engine, for example,
      tube 10 is approximately 63/8 inches long with an outer diameter
      of approximately 3 inches. For a 52 hp diesel engine, tube 10 is
      approximately 7 inches long with an outer diameter of
      approximately 2 inches.<br>
      <br>
      The operation of the invention may be varied in different
      applications. For a 400 hp 500 cu.in. gasoline engine, for
      example, the voltage to the tungsten filaments--and, therefore,
      the amount of ions produced--may be varied according to the load
      on the engine in any manner known in the art. For a smaller
      engine, on the other hand, such as a 52 hp diesel engine, the
      device may be run at a single output level without regard to the
      load on the engine.<br>
      <br>
      While the embodiment disclosed above is located at the air cleaner
      intake for ease of retrofit, the apparatus may also be disposed
      after the air cleaner and closer to the air/fuel mixing point.
      Placing the ion generator closer to the engine minimizes the loss
      of charge to metal engine parts between the ion generator and the
      combustion chamber.<br>
      <br>
      The ionization apparatus of this invention may be modified to
      include a copper grid coated with manganese dioxide located at the
      outlet to the ionization tube 10. The manganese dioxide reacts
      with the ozone flowing through the grid and removes a substantial
      portion of the ozone from the ionization tube effluent. The grid
      may be either charged or grounded. In addition, the manganese
      dioxide may be replaced with any other material suitable for
      removing ozone.<br>
      <br>
      An alternative embodiment of this invention is shown in FIG. 5.
      The plastic ionization tube 10 of the previous embodiment is
      replaced with a metal tube 120. Tube 120 is connected electrically
      to ground via a suitable connector 121. When the voltage source is
      applied to the filaments 34 in tube 120, a cold corona discharge
      occurs between tube 120 and filaments 34. This discharge increases
      the ionization of the air and requires a greater power input to
      the device.<br>
      <br>
      This arrangement also increases ozone production. The exit grid 22
      of the previous embodiment is therefore replaced with a manganese
      dioxide coated copper grid 122 which is either grounded or charged
      with a constant voltage.<br>
      <br>
      A third embodiment is shown in FIG. 6. This embodiment uses a
      plastic tube 10 covered with metal foil 140. The foil 140 is
      electrically connected to ground via a suitable connector 141. The
      plastic of tube 10 therefore acts like a dielectric, thereby
      increasing the potential between the foil 140 and filaments 34.
      This arrangement produces more ions than the first embodiment and
      less ozone than the second embodiment. A manganese dioxide coated
      copper grid may be added to the outlet of the device of this third
      embodiment to minimize the effects of the ozone produced.<br>
      <br>
      Other modifications to this invention will be apparent to those of
      ordinary skill in the art. Such modifications may be made without
      departing from the scope of this invention.<br>
