      <div align="center"><big><b>OTRAG</b><br>
        </big></div>
      <br>
      OTRAG (German: Orbital Transport und Raketen AG, or Orbital
      Transport and Rockets, Inc.), was a German company based in
      Stuttgart, which planned in the late 1970s and early 1980s to
      develop an alternative propulsion system for rockets. OTRAG was
      the first commercial developer and producer of space launch
      vehicles. The OTRAG Rocket claimed to present an inexpensive
      alternative to existing launch systems through mass-production of
      Common Rocket Propulsion Units (CRPU).<br>
      <br>
      <b>History</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      OTRAG was founded in 1975 by the German aerospace engineer Lutz
      Kayser. Its goal was to develop, produce, and operate a radically
      different, low cost, satellite launch vehicle.<br>
      <br>
      The OTRAG rocket was intended to be an inexpensive alternative to
      the European rocket Ariane and the NASA space shuttle.[1] Kayser
      and a private consortium of six hundred European investors
      financed the development and production of the OTRAG satellite
      launch vehicle. Dr.Ing Kurt H. Debus served as Chairman of the
      Board of OTRAG after his retirement as director of NASA's Kennedy
      Space Center,[2] and Dr. Wernher von Braun served as scientific
      adviser to Kayser.<br>
      <br>
      In the face of doubts by Debus and von Braun, Kayser chose in 1975
      to set up testing and launch facilities in Shaba, Zaire (now
      Katanga Province in the Democratic Republic of the Congo). Debus
      and von Braun were concerned about the possibility of Zairian
      acquisition of missile technology from the facilities. Kayser
      decided to proceed despite their opposition, and testing began at
      the site in 1977.<br>
      <br>
      Political pressure to halt the company's operations mounted
      quickly. France and the Soviet Union were historically opposed to
      German long-distance rocket development, and pressured the
      Congolese government into closing down the development facility in
      1979. Immediately afterwards, Presidents Giscard d'Estaing of
      France and Leonid Brezhnev of the Soviet Union convinced the West
      German government to cancel the OTRAG project and close down its
      German operations. In 1980, OTRAG moved its production and testing
      facilities to a desert site in Libya. A series of successful tests
      were conducted at this site beginning in 1981.[3]<br>
      <br>
      <b>Rocket design</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      OTRAG was a design quite different from conventional multi-stage
      rockets. The OTRAG design used parallel stages assembled from
      parallel tanktubes with flat bulkheads. The rockets were designed
      to carry loads up to two tons, the then usual weight of a
      communications satellite, into a geostationary orbit. It was
      planned to later increase the capacity to ten tons or more using
      multiple identical modules.<br>
      <br>
      The rocket was to consist of individual pipes, each 27 cm in
      diameter and six meters long. Four of these pipes would be
      installed one above the other resulting in a 24 meter long fuel
      and oxidizer tank with a rocket engine at the lower end. The fuel
      was intended to be kerosene with a 50/50 mixture of nitric acid
      and dinitrogen tetroxide as an oxidiser. Ignition was provided by
      a small quantity of furfuryl alcohol injected before the fuel,
      which ignites hypergolically (immediately and energetically) upon
      contact with the nitric acid. To simplify the design, pumps were
      not used to move the fuel to the engines, instead the fuel tanks
      were only 66% filled, with compressed air in the remaining space
      to press propellants into the ablatively cooled combustion
      chamber. Thrust control is by partially closing the
      electromechanical propellant valves. Pitch and yaw control can
      thus be achieved by differential throttling. In principle this is
      extremely reliable and cheap in mass production.<br>
      <br>
      The modular design was intended to result in a large cost
      reduction due to economies of scale. The CRPU-based satellite
      launching rocket was estimated to cost approximately one tenth of
      conventional designs. Automated production processes for all
      components would reduce labor cost from 80% to 20% and remove the
      justification for reusability of spent stages.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Controversies and future outlook</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Only a few political controversies are known concerning OTRAG
      because of concerns of neighbors of Zaire and Libya about the dual
      use potential of rockets. A full orbital launch vehicle was never
      assembled. Modules were flight tested in Zaire and Libya. 6,000
      static rocket engine tests and 16 single stage qualification tests
      were made to prove the concept as feasible.<br>
      <br>
      The German minister of foreign affairs at that time, Hans Dietrich
      Genscher, is said to have finally stopped the project under
      pressure from France and the Soviet Union, and West Germany joined
      the co-financed "European rocket" Ariane project, which made the
      OTRAG project unnecessary and eliminated political entanglements
      of a still divided Germany in the early 1980s.<br>
      <br>
      NASA Commercial Orbital Transportation Services announcement
      stipulates a 50% US National ownership in vendor companies like
      von Braun Debus Kayser Rocket Science LLC, DE (BDKRS). This would
      force Kayser, a German citizen, to sell at least 50% of his shares
      to Americans.<br>
      <br>
      More recently, the company has been advising Interorbital Systems,
      resulting in a similar modular rocket design for their Neptune
      series.[4]<br>
      <br>
      John Carmack, founder and lead engineer of Armadillo Aerospace has
      stated in his monthly reports and in forum posts that he expects
      his path to an orbital vehicle to include modular rockets similar
      to OTRAG technology. Kayser, being the founding engineer of OTRAG,
      visited Armadillo in May, 2006 and loaned Carmack some of their
      original research hardware.<br>
      <br>
      "I have been corresponding with Lutz [Kayser] for a few months
      now, and I have learned quite a few things. I seriously considered
      an OTRAG style massive-cluster-of-cheap-modules orbital design
      back when we had 98% peroxide (assumed to be a biprop with
      kerosene), and I have always considered it one of the viable
      routes to significant reduction in orbital launch costs. After
      really going over the trades and details with Lutz, I am quite
      convinced that this is the lowest development cost route to
      significant orbital capability. Eventually, reusable stages will
      take over, but I actually think that we can make it all the way to
      orbit on our current budget by following this path. The individual
      modules are less complicated than our current vehicles, and I am
      becoming more and more fond of high production methods over hand
      crafter prototypes." -- June 2006 Armadillo Aerospace Update[5]<br>

      Kayser, Lutz T (1939-) German engineer and low-cost rocket
      pioneer. 1975-1987 developed Otrag concept - clustered large
      numbers of low-cost storable liquid rocket modules to reduce costs
      by 10x. Tested in Congo and Libya, but project killed by vested
      interests.<br>
      <br>
      Kayser started his first serious work as a 17-year old student,
      founding the Arbeitsgemeinschaft fuer Raketentechnik und Raumfahrt
      an der Universitaet Stuttgart (Working Group for Rocket Technology
      and Space Travel at the University of Stuttgart) in 1955. This was
      the first student group at a German University to be active in
      rocket propulsion and space flight research - at a time before the
      first satellites were launched and the feasibility of stable
      satellite orbits was still disputed in academic circles. Eugen
      Saenger was the mentor of the group and arranged research grants
      from the Baden-Wuertemberg Economic Ministry. Kayser received the
      degree of Diplom-Ingenieur (equivalent to a Master of Science) in
      Aeronautics and Astronautics from the University of Stuttgart.<br>
      <br>
      Working at the request of the Baden-Wuerttemberg government,
      Kayser selected the site of the Lampoldshausen Rocket Test Centre.
      Together with Wolfgang Pilz, he laid out the design for the
      facility. In the 21st Century it remained the largest such
      institute in Europe.<br>
      <br>
      Kayser's first major development was a bipropellant satellite
      attitude control systems (later sold to North American Rocketdyne
      and the US Air Force Rocket Propulsion Laboratory, Edwards AF
      Base). He also collaborated with the Rocket Engine Division of the
      NASA Marshall Space Flight Center in connection with the Saturn-IB
      clustered engine concept. Kayser developed the first ablative
      combustion chamber for the H-1 engine, later tested in firings at
      Huntsville. This was a first step towards his concept of parallel
      clustering of low-cost ablative engines. Further work on the idea
      was supported by von Braun and jointly financed by NASA and the
      German Ministry of Scientific Research. Kayser founded
      Technologieforschung GmbH (TF) as a commercial spin-off to handle
      these and other contracts.<br>
      <br>
      Kayser invented, developed, and tested the TIROC rocket engine
      (Tangential Injection and Rotational Combustion). It was the
      world's smallest thruster burning Monomethylhydrazine and Nitrogen
      tetroxide. It delivered 1 newton thrust (0.2 lbf) with a minimum
      burning time of 1 milliseconds and a demonstrated maximum burning
      time of 1 million seconds (11 days). The valves had response times
      of under 1 millisecond and were capable of more than 1 million
      cycles at a 6 sigma confidence level. Kayser also developed one of
      the first capillary action gas-liquid separation systems. This
      guaranteed positive liquid flow from propellant tanks to the
      rocket engines in zero-gravity. Future applications were high
      performance satellite and space vehicle attitude control systems.<br>
      <br>
      The first pan-European launch vehicle program was the European
      Launcher Development Organization's Europa I of the 1960s. This
      medium lift vehicle consisted of a British first stage (Blue
      Streak), a French second stage (Veronique), and a German third
      stage. After several attempts without a single successful launch,
      the German Government asked Kayser to investigate. Explosions
      always occurred shortly after cutoff of the French second stage
      and before ignition of the German third stage. Kayser had just
      finished assisting Professor Argyris of Stuttgart University in
      developing the world's first finite element computation method for
      solution of statics and dynamics of structures (ASKA).<br>
      <br>
      Applying this dynamic simulation to the combined second-third
      stage ELDO- launch vehicle before separation, and following
      exhaustive evaluation of all telemetry data Kayser concluded:<br>
      <br>
      ...that the rough chamber pressure and thrust oscillations of the
      second stage rocket engine during cut-off destroyed the intertank
      bulkhead of the third stage. This in turn hypergolically ignited
      the liquid propellants (N2O4/N2H4) and the third stage exploded
      before its engine could even be started.<br>
      <br>
      ...the structural design of the stage was fundamentally flawed and
      would be very expensive to modify.<br>
      <br>
      As a consequence of this report and other performance and
      political factors, the ELDO program was cancelled in 1972.<br>
      <br>
      Thereafter Kayser's TF received German Government contracts to
      study and analyse NASA's proposed Space Shuttle project. It soon
      became clear to Kayser that during the first two years of
      development too many conflicting US Government requirements were
      incorporated into the design. He also found that industry desires
      to sell their respective technologies forced incompatible features
      together. Solid propellant boosters increased cost. Wings twice as
      large as necessary for NASA made the delta-winged shuttle orbiter
      less safe than a lifting body design. Based on Kayser's
      recommendation the German Government stopped participation in that
      program. It took NASA 25 years to reach the same conclusion - that
      the Space Shuttle was inherently flawed and needed a successor as
      soon as possible.<br>
      <br>
      It was clear that governments had a hard time finding researchers
      and engineers for impartial assessment of large, expensive and
      long term space projects. Analysis of such large systems required
      a very wide knowledge of all scientific fields with decades of
      experience and an independent view. Kayser had these abilities and
      as a result became a consultant to NASA, DARPA, USAF, and NRO in
      formulating future US space programs.<br>
      <br>
      In the early 1970's Willy Brandt's Ministry of Science and
      Technology solicited a contract for demonstration of launch
      vehicle technology an order of magnitude cheaper and more reliable
      than existing launchers. Kayser's research company TF won the
      contract and developed a radically new rocket technology, making
      more than 20 inventions in the process.<br>
      <br>
      Kayser's concept involved the parallel clustering of large numbers
      of identical propellant tank and rocket engine modules. This
      allowed the application of mass production techniques as used in
      the automobile industry. This in turn resulted in cost reduction
      by a factor of 10. This breakthrough and the static testing in of
      prototype modules at Lampoldshausen stirred concern in the
      competitive aerospace industry. The established space launch
      companies were accustomed to making easy guaranteed profits
      through high cost plus fixed fee government contracts.<br>
      <br>
      In order to exploit this low-cost rocket technology on a
      commercial basis Kayser founded OTRAG (Orbital Transport und
      Raketen AG). It was the world's first commercial launcher
      development, production and launch company.<br>
      <br>
      Wernher von Braun and Kurt Debus, the leading managers of American
      rocketry, were so enthusiastic about the project that they joined
      the team after their retirement from NASA. Their contribution was
      important and helped to introduce lessons learned from earlier
      programs. Von Braun introduced the concept of parallel clustering
      of tanks and engines with his Saturn I design and had shown the
      way towards the low-cost breakthrough 20 years earlier. However,
      both rocket pioneers were in doubt whether this technology should
      be flight tested in developing countries because of the
      possibility that it would be misused for weapons. Kayser
      optimistically hoped he would be able to limit the technology to
      commercial satellite launchings. Kayser was proven wrong and
      suffered heavy losses as a result.<br>
      <br>
      International controversy erupted when Kayser conducted suborbital
      test flights from launch ranges in the Congo and Libya. 14
      suborbital test flights proved the concept and led to a 100%
      qualification of the technology and the verified the extremely low
      production cost. However Soviet president Brezhnev and French
      president Giscard d'Estaing applied heavy political pressure on
      the German government to stop the project. After a total
      investment of $ 150 million, OTRAG had to terminate production in
      Germany. Production was relocated to the launch site in Libya.
      This in turn led to Libyan military circles eyeing the facilities
      as a means of obtaining military rocket technology. OTRAG's
      production and launch range equipment were illegally confiscated,
      as had happened to the foreign oil industry a decade earlier. All
      attempts by Kayser to solve the problem were futile. Without
      Kayser's know-how the Libyans were able to conduct only a few test
      launches with the stolen equipment. After ten years of desultory
      testing the Libyan program came to an end.<br>
      <br>
      As of 2005, Kayser was actively searching for partners to fund an
      OTRAG production facility in the United States and to apply his
      unique low-cost technology to the requirements of the future
      American space program. He founded von Braun Debus Kayser Rocket
      Science LLC to transfer OTRAG's intellectual property and know-how
      to the United States. Kayser, along with newer private
      entrepreneurs such as Musk, Rutan, and Bezos, still dream of
      achieving the goal of affordable space transport below $ 1,000 per
      pound into orbit.<br>

      </div>
      <br>
      A liquid-fueled rocket has a storage tank for the fuel components
      of a liquid fuel and the storage tank is able to communicate with
      the combustion chambers of the rocket via normally closed valves.
      The storage tank is enclosed and the fuel components only in part
      fill the latter. A body of gas is confined in the storage tank and
      has a pressure exceeding that in the combustion chambers. Thus,
      when the valves are opened, the fuel components are caused to flow
      from the storage tank to the combustion chambers by virtue of the
      difference between the pressure of the gas and the pressure in the
      combustion chambers.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The invention relates generally to liquid-fueled rockets. More
      particularly, the invention relates to a method and an arrangement
      for conveying the liquid fuel of a liquid-fueled rocket from the
      storage tanks of the rocket to the combustion chambers of the
      latter.<br>
      <br>
      The fuel components of a liquid-fueled rocket, that is, the
      combustible component and the oxidizer constituting the liquid
      fuel, must be forced into the power plant of the rocket by
      suitable conveying means. In the known rockets of this type, this
      is accomplished by pumping or by pressurizing the storage tanks
      for the fuel components.<br>
      <br>
      Various methods have been proposed and used for pressurizing the
      fuel components in the storage tanks. In these methods, the fuel
      components are subjected to the action of a pressure gas which
      latter is, for example, produced by a separate gas generator or a
      separate solid-gas generator.<br>
      <br>
      The known methods have several disadvantages. The use of pumps is
      expensive and structurally prohibitive and, in addition, decreases
      the useful pay load of the rocket because of the weight of the
      pumps.<br>
      <br>
      Where a pressure gas is used for conveying the fuel components
      from the storage tanks to the combustion chambers, it is necessary
      to provide separate containers for the fuel required to generate
      the pressure gas and it is also necessary to provide a gas
      generator. In addition, the methods using a pressure gas require
      an active regulating circuit for regulating the quantity of
      pressure gas to be introduced into the storage tanks.<br>
      <br>
      In all of the known methods for conveying the fuel components via
      pressurization, the requisite energy for conveying the fuel
      components is supplied to the storage tanks from an external
      source. These methods are expensive and require additional fuel
      for generating the pressure gas as well as valves, conduits,
      generators and additional fuel containers. Aside from the
      structural and operational difficulties associated with the use of
      these methods, their use causes an increase in the weight of the
      rocket and, hence, a reduction in the useful pay load.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      It is, accordingly, a general object of the invention to provide a
      novel method and arrangement for conveying the liquid fuel of a
      liquid-fueled rocket from the storage tanks of the rocket to the
      power plant or combustion chambers of the latter.<br>
      <br>
      Another object of the invention is to provide a method and
      arrangement whereby the liquid fuel of a liquid-fueled rocket may
      be conveyed from the storage tanks of the rocket to the power
      plant of the latter in simple manner.<br>
      <br>
      A further object of the invention is to provide a method and
      arrangement for conveying the liquid fuel of a liquid-fueled
      rocket from the storage tanks of the rocket to the power plant of
      the latter without significantly reducing the useful pay load of
      the rocket.<br>
      <br>
      An additional object of the invention is to provide a method for
      conveying the liquid fuel of a liquid-fueled rocket from the
      storage tanks of the rocket to the power plant of the latter which
      does not require complicated and expensive equipment.<br>
      <br>
      A concomitant object of the invention is to provide an arrangement
      for conveying the liquid fuel of a liquid-fueled rocket from the
      storage tanks of the rocket to the power plant of the latter which
      is simple in its construction and inexpensive.<br>
      <br>
      In accordance with the objects outlined above and others which
      will become apparent hereafter, the invention provides a method of
      conveying the fuel components of a liquid-fueled rocket from the
      storage tanks to the combustion chambers of the rocket wherein
      fuel components to be conveyed to a combustion space are confined
      in an enclosed space so as to only partially fill the latter. A
      quantity of gas sufficient to cause the pressure of the same to
      exceed the pressure in the combustion space is also confined in
      the enclosed space. A flow path is established between the
      enclosed space and the combustion space and this causes the fuel
      components to flow from the enclosed space to the combustion space
      by virtue of the difference between the pressure of the gas and
      the pressure in the combustion space. Also disclosed is a novel
      arrangement for conveying the fuel components of a liquid-fueled
      rocket from the storage tanks to the combustion chambers of the
      rocket.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, according to the invention, the fuel components are forced
      into the combustion chamber or chambers of the rocket by a gas
      which is confined under pressure in the same storage tank or tanks
      as the fuel components themselves. Suitable gases for this purpose
      are, for example, nitrogen, helium, air or the like.<br>
      <br>
      The initial pressure of the gas, that is, the pressure of the
      confined gas before the fuel components have begun to flow into
      the combustion chambers, is dependent upon the type of power plant
      used for the rocket and may lie, for example, between about 5 and
      100 bars. The initial pressure of the gas is favorably between
      about 20 and 40 bars and, advantageously, is equal to
      approximately 30 bars. However, the invention is not limited to
      the values given above. As an example, the initial pressure of the
      gas may be higher for a rocket which operates in the atmosphere
      than for a rocket which operates in vacuum.<br>
      <br>
      In a suitable arrangement for carrying out the method according to
      the invention, at least one of the storage tanks of the rocket
      includes at least one portion for accommodating the gas and which
      is in communication with, or may be brought into communication
      with, the portions of the storage tank which accommodate the fuel
      components.<br>
      <br>
      Where the storage tanks of the rocket include more than one
      portion for accommodating the gas, it is possible to interpose
      suitable valves between these portions and the initial pressure of
      the gas may be different in the various portions.<br>
      <br>
      Advantageously, the initial volume of the gas, that is, the volume
      of the confined gas before the fuel components have begun to flow
      into the combustion chambers, amounts to approximately 20 to 50%
      of the total volume of the storage tanks.<br>
      <br>
      The portion or portions of the storage tanks accommodating the
      combustible fuel component may be sealed with a membrane which
      tears open when the rocket begins to operate or, in other words,
      when the valves interposed between the storage tanks and the
      combustion chambers are opened.<br>
      <br>
      The invention not only makes it possible to eliminate special
      pumps for conveying the fuel components but also makes it possible
      to eliminate the additional storage tanks, as well as the
      corresponding conduits and generators, which it would be necessary
      to provide for the generation of a pressure gas when using those
      methods wherein the fuel components are conveyed by such a gas and
      where additional fuel for generation of the latter is required.
      Furthermore, by utilizing the invention, there is no need to
      provide special regulating circuits for regulating the quantity of
      pressure gas introduced into the storage tanks so as to produce
      the requisite pressure in the latter.<br>
      <br>
      The novel features which are considered as characteristic for the
      invention are set forth in particular in the appended claims. The
      invention itself, however, both as to its construction and its
      method of operation, together with additional objects and
      advantages thereof, will be best understood from the following
      description of specific embodiments when read in connection with
      the accompanying drawings.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING</b><b><br>

      <b> </b><b><br>
      </b><b>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Referring to FIG. 1, a storage tank or container for the liquid
      fuel of a liquid-fueled rocket is indicated generally at 10 and is
      seen to be of so-called parallel construction. The storage tank 10
      includes two portions 12 and 14 for accommodating the combustible
      fuel component of the liquid fuel and the portions 12 and 14
      extend parallel to the longitudinal axis of the storage tank 10.
      In the illustrated embodiment, the portions 12 and 14 are located
      diametrically opposite one another. However, instead of being
      provided with two portions for accommodating the combustible fuel
      component, the storage tank 10 may be provided with a plurality of
      such portions, for example, four portions, or may be provided with
      only one portion for the combustible fuel component. The portions
      12 and 14 are only partially filled with the combustible fuel
      component, for instance, to the level indicated at 15.<br>
      <br>
      The storage tank 10 includes another portion 16, 18, the part 16
      of which is filled with the oxidizing fuel component or the
      oxidizer to the level indicated at 17, that is, the oxidizer only
      partially fills the portion 16, 18. The part 18 of the portion
      16,18 is filled with a body of gas. It will be seen that the
      storage tank 10 defines an enclosed space in which the fuel
      components and the gas are confined.<br>
      <br>
      In the illustrated embodiment, the portions 12 and 14 are closed
      at their upper ends with membranes 19 and 21, respectively, so
      that the gas in the portion 16,18 does not communicate with the
      combustible fuel component. However, it is also possible to
      eliminate these membranes so that the gas in the portion 16,18 is
      in direct communication with the combustible fuel component. The
      only purpose of the membranes 19 and 21 is to keep the combustible
      fuel component separated from the oxidizer during storage and when
      the rocket is transported. The membranes 19 and 21 may be of a
      thin synthetic resin foil or a synthetic resin sheet such as, for
      example, polyester. Below the lower end of the storage tank 10
      there are located the propulsion means for the rocket including
      the combustion space or combustion chambers 20 and 22. Suitable
      valves 24 are interposed between the combustion chambers 20 and 22
      and the portions 12 and 14, as well as the portion 16,18, of the
      storage tank 10. The valves 24 are normally closed, that is, the
      valves 24 will usually be closed until the rocket is to be
      operated, and when the valves 24 are opened a flow path is
      established between the combustion chambers 20 and 22 and the
      portions 12 and 14, as well as the portion 16,18, of the storage
      tank 10.<br>
      <br>
      It is pointed out here that the construction and arrangement of
      the combustion chambers and the valves, as well as of the conduit
      system for introducing the fuel components into the combustion
      chambers, do not form part of the invention per se and, hence, are
      only schematically illustrated.<br>
      <br>
      In operation of the embodiment of FIG. 1, the portions 12 and 14
      of the storage tank 10 are filled with a combustible fuel
      component to the level 15 and the portion 16,18 is filled to the
      level 17 with an oxidizer. The part 18 of the portion 16,18 is
      then filled with a gas such as, for example, nitrogen, in a
      quantity sufficient that the gas is at a superpressure. The
      important consideration is that the pressure of the confined gas
      exceeds the pressure in the combustion chambers 20 and 22. The gas
      is thus in direct communication with the oxidizer and, if the
      membranes 19 and 21 are not used, will also be in direct
      communication with the combustible fuel component.<br>
      <br>
      When the rocket is to be started or fired, the valves 24 are
      opened as a result of which the pressure in the portions 12 and
      14, which are closed by the membranes 19 and 21 in the embodiment
      being discussed, decreases. This decrease in pressure, in
      conjunction with the fact that the pressure of the gas in the
      portion 16,18 exceeds that in the combustion chambers 20 and 22,
      causes the membranes 19 and 21 to tear open. The combustible fuel
      component and the oxidizer then flow into the combustion chambers
      20 and 22 by virtue of the difference between the pressure of the
      gas confined in the portion 16,18 and the pressure in the
      combustion chambers 20 and 22.<br>
      <br>
      As the fuel components flow out of the respective portions 12 and
      14 and 16,18, the volume available to the confined gas increases
      and, as a consequence, its pressure decreases. According to the
      law governing the adiabatic expansion of gases, the initial
      pressure of the gas, that is, the pressure of the confined gas at
      the time that the fuel components begin to flow out of the storage
      tank 10, and the final pressure of the gas, that is, the pressure
      of the gas when the storage tank 10 has been substantially
      emptied, are in a ratio which is equal to the ratio of the total
      volume of the storage tank 10 to the initial volume of the
      confined gas. It will be understood that the quantity and the
      initial pressure of the confined gas are such as to permit the
      fuel components to be substantially entirely emptied from the
      storage tank 10.<br>
      <br>
      The initial volume of the confined gas in the part 18 of the
      portion 16,18 may, for example, amount to about 20 to 50% of the
      total volume of the storage tank 10. The initial pressure of the
      confined gas may, for instance, lie between 20 and 40 bars and
      advantageously is equal to approximately 30 bars. However, the
      initial pressure of the confined gas is dependent upon the type of
      power plant with which the rocket is provided, that is, the
      initial pressure of the gas depends upon the size and construction
      of the power plant and upon the requirements imposed upon the
      power plant. With these considerations in mind, it is pointed out
      that the initial pressure of the confined gas may suitably be
      between about 5 and 100 bars, although the values for the initial
      pressure of the gas given here are not to be construed as limiting
      the invention in any manner.<br>
      <br>
      Referring now to FIG. 2, the storage tank or container for the
      liquid fuel of a liquid-fueled rocket is here seen to include two
      sections 30 and 32 arranged in tandem. The section 30 has a
      portion 34 which is filled with a combustible fuel component to
      the level indicated at 35 and another portion 36 which is filled
      with a body of gas.<br>
      <br>
      The section 32 has a portion 38 which is filled to the level
      indicated at 39 with an oxidizer, and the section 32 also has a
      portion 40 filled with a body of gas.<br>
      <br>
      The propulsion means for the rocket is located below the section
      32 and includes a combustion space or combustion chamber 48. The
      section 30 is connected with the combustion chamber 48 via a
      conduit 46. A valve 50 is provided in the conduit 46 as well as in
      the conduit connecting the section 32 with the combustion chamber
      48. The valves 50 are normally closed until the rocket is to be
      started. It will be appreciated that the sections 30 and 32 define
      an enclosed space in which the fuel components and the gas are
      confined.<br>
      <br>
      Again, the construction and arrangement of the combustion chamber,
      thevalves and the conduit system for conveying the fuel components
      from the storage tank to the combustion chamber do not form part
      of the invention per se and are not, therefore, illustrated in
      detail.<br>
      <br>
      In operation of the embodiment shown in FIG. 2, the sections 30
      and 32 are respectively filled with a combustible fuel component
      and an oxidizer to the respective levels 35 and 39, that is, the
      fuel components only partially fill the sections 30 and 32. The
      portions 36 and 40 of the sections 30 and 32, respectively, are
      then filled with a gas the quantity of which is sufficient in each
      instance to raise the pressure of the gas in each of the sections
      30 and 32 to a value which exceeds the value of the pressure in
      the combustion chamber 48.<br>
      <br>
      When the rocket is to be started or fired, the valves 50 are
      opened whereupon the fuel components are forced into the
      combustion chamber 48 by virtue of the difference between the
      pressure of the confined gas in the respective sections 30 and 32
      and the pressure in the combustion chamber 48. The initial
      pressure of the gas in the section 30 may be different from that
      of the gas in the section 32 and, in the illustrated tandem
      construction, the initial pressure of the gas in the section 30 is
      advantageously lower than that of the gas in the section 32 in
      order to provide compensation for the greater hydrostatic pressure
      head of the fuel component in the section 30 as opposed to the
      lower hydrostatic pressure head of the fuel component in the
      section 32, i.e. in order to provide an equalization of pressure.
      (The hydrostatic pressure head in the section 32 falls off to
      substantially zero which, with regard to the section 30, is not
      the case because of the presence of the conduit 46 which latter is
      usually not completely emptied). It will be understood that the
      quantity and initial pressure of the gas in the respective
      sections 30 and 32 are such as to permit the fuel components to be
      substantially completely emptied therefrom.<br>
      <br>
      In many circumstances, the sections 30 and 32 may be connected by
      a conduit 42 so as to permit an equalization of the pressures in
      the sections 30 and 32 through the conduit 42. Advantageously, the
      conduit 42 is provided with a valve 44.<br>
      <br>
      If desired, the initial volume of the gas in the section 30 and
      the initial volume of the gas in the section 32 may be so selected
      that the ratio of the initial volume of the gas in the section 30
      to the total volume of the section 30 equals the ratio of the
      initial volume of the gas in the section 32 to the total volume of
      the section 32.<br>
      <br>
      By utilizing the invention, the total energy required for
      conveying the fuel components to the combustion chamber or
      chambers is already stored, in form of the compression of the gas,
      before the rocket is started or fired and, therefore, this energy
      need not be supplied to the storage tank or tanks from an external
      source. This manner of conveying the fuel components, that is,
      conveying the fuel components without introducing a gas or
      supplying energy to the storage tanks from externally, is
      structurally simpler and also cheaper than the conveying methods
      used for rockets heretofore. Furthermore, the entire operation is
      considerably more reliable when using the invention since there is
      no need to provide active regulating elements such as, for
      example, pressure reducing valves or gas generators. Such
      reliability is, of course, of great importance in rockets.<br>

      <div align="center"><b>ROCKET ENGINE</b><br>
        <b>US3640072</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      A rocket engine has an internal combustion chamber provided with a
      front wall. An outlet nozzle is provided in the front wall. At
      least two injection conduits communicate with the chamber
      rearwardly of the front wall in such a manner as to inject into
      the chamber respective streams of reactive propellants in
      direction tangentially of the chamber walls thus providing a short
      heat conduction path from the nozzle throat to the injected but
      yet unburned propellants rotating at high speed along the chamber
      walls.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The present invention relates generally to a fuel-combusting
      device, and more particularly to a rocket engine. The invention
      also relates to a method of operating a rocket engine.<br>
      <br>
      Rocket engines, and the operation thereof, are well known. The
      present invention is particularly concerned with small rocket
      engines wherein two or more liquid and/or gaseous fuel are
      injected for producing a gas stream. Such rocket engines are
      employed where small or very small amounts of thrust are needed,
      for instance as control thrusters of satellites, rocket-propelled
      aerospace vehicles and guided missiles. They are also used as the
      basic components of gas generators producing working gases such as
      are needed for the drive of turbines of auxiliary aggregates.<br>
      <br>
      Rocket engines for these general purposes are of course already
      known. However, they suffer from various disadvantages, relating
      primarily to the problem of cooling the engines, providing proper
      propellant mixture ratio in the engine and operating the engine
      continuously. Particularly where small propellant quantities and
      small or very small thrusts below 7 pounds are involved, no
      properly operational rocket engines based on two or more component
      propellant systems are known, because it has been impossible to
      solve the cooling problem involved.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      It is, accordingly, an object of the present invention to avoid
      the aforementioned disadvantages.<br>
      <br>
      More particularly it is an object of the present invention ro
      provide a propellant-combusting device for rocket engines of low
      thrust such as used for the control of satellites,
      rocket-propelled aerospace vehicles and guided missiles, and also
      of the type which is used for gas production in gas generators.<br>
      <br>
      A more particular object of the present invention is to provide
      such a device which provides for proper cooling, particularly in
      the region of the outlet nozzle.<br>
      <br>
      An additional object of the invention is to provide a method of
      operating such a device.<br>
      <br>
      In pursuance of the above objects, and others which will become
      apparent hereafter, one feature of my invention resides, briefly
      stated, in a propellant-combusting device which comprises wall
      means surrounding and defining an internal combustion chamber
      having a front wall portion. Outlet nozzle means is provided in
      the front wall portion and communicates with the chamber.
      Injecting means also communicates with the chamber and is
      operative for injecting into the same streams of reactive
      propellants in direction tangentially of the chamber, whereby the
      injected propellants initially sweep over and cool the wall means
      rearwardly of the front wall portion by taking off all heat
      conducted from the nozzle through the front wall radially outward
      simultaneously undergoing intimate mixture, prior to advancing
      towards and into the outlet nozzle means.<br>
      <br>
      Because the rotation of the fuel streams resulting from the
      centrifugal forces acting upon them, and the resulting sweep of
      the fuel streams over the walls of the combustion chamber
      rearwardly of the front wall portion which is provided with the
      outlet nozzle, serves to cool these walls the present invention
      overcomes the cooling problem associated with the constructions
      known from the prior art. The flow of the fuel through the
      combustion chamber is radially inwardly from the outside towards
      the centrally located outlet nozzle and the maximum heat density
      is in the region of the throat of the outlet nozzle. According to
      the present invention the total cross-sectional area of the front
      wall portion in which the outlet nozzle is provided is a multiple
      of the cross-sectional area of the smallest radius of the throat
      of the outlet nozzle. In such a construction the heat transmitted
      to the outlet nozzle by the escaping hot gases is initially
      transmitted to the front wall portion surrounding the outlet
      nozzle, then radially outwardly conducted in this front wall
      portion, and then conducted rearwardly into the wall surrounding
      the combustion chamber rearwardly of the front wall portion into
      the region of the injecting means which injects the fuel
      components into the combustion chamber. In the region of injecting
      means the thus-conducted heat transmitted through the wall
      bounding the internal combustion chamber to the fuel which has
      been injected and which sweeps in a rotary motion over the inner
      surface of the wall under the influence of centrifugal force. It
      thus preheats the fuel which is desirable but is conducted away
      from and unable to damage the nozzle throat.<br>

      </b><b>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Discussing firstly the embodiment illustrated in FIGS. 1, 2a and
      3, it will be understood that reference character E identifies the
      engine in general which comprises an internal combustion chamber 1
      bounded by a rear wall 2, a front wall 3 and a circumferential
      wall 4. The front wall 3 is provided with an outlet nozzle 5 which
      is illustrated diagrammatically and whose particular construction
      may be in accordance with the teachings of the prior art well
      known to those skilled in this field. However, the nozzle 5 is
      located centrally of the front wall 3 and, in accordance with the
      present invention, the smallest cross-sectional diameter 8 of the
      nozzle 5 at the throat or neck thereof, is considerably smaller
      than the cross-sectional area of the front wall 3. This could also
      be stated, conversely, by saying that the cross-sectional area of
      the front wall 3 is a multiple of the cross-sectional area of the
      throat 8 of the nozzle 5.<br>
      <br>
      The circumferential wall 4 is provided in the embodiment of FIGS.
      1, 2a and 3 with two oppositely located inlet bores 6 and 7
      constituting injecting means for two reactive propellants or
      propellant components, and in accordance with the invention and as
      clearly visible in FIG. 2a, bores 6 and 7 are so located that the
      streams of fuel injected into the combustion chamber 1 are
      injected tangentially to the periphery of the combustion chamber
      1. They are thus forced to sweep over the inner surface of the
      circumferential wall 4 bounding the combustion chamber 1 in a
      rotary motion and to cool the wall 4, before they mix and react
      with one another. The bores 6 and 7 are located in the embodiment
      of FIGS. 1, 2a and 3 in a common plane normal to the axis of the
      combustion chamber 1, that is the axis extending through the
      nozzle 5. In the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 2b, which
      corresponds to that of FIGS. 1, 2a and 3 in most particulars,
      there are provided three inlet bores 6, 7 and 15 which each inject
      a stream of a propellant component. It is evident from FIG. 2b
      that the three bores 6, 7 and 15 may also be located in a common
      transverse plane.<br>
      <br>
      FIGS. 1 and 3 shown the manner in which heat is conducted away
      from the nozzle 5 in operation of the engine E. The heat
      transmitted to the nozzle 5 by the escaping hot gases is conducted
      radially through the front wall portion 3 (see FIG. 3) and is then
      conducted rearwardly into the circumferential wall 4 to the region
      of the inlet bores 6 and 7 (and 15, in the case of FIG. 2b) where
      it is transmitted to the injected propellants which sweeps over
      the inner surface of the circumferential wall 4 prior to mixture.
      Because of the nonlinear radial temperature curve in the wall
      portion 3 which has a very large cross-sectional area by
      comparison with the cross-sectional area of the throat 8 of the
      nozzle 5, this manner of conducting heat away from the nozzle 5 is
      the more advantageous the smaller the cross-sectional area of the
      throat 8 of the nozzle 5 is, that is the smaller the thrust of the
      engine or the smaller the flow of fuel therethrough. By contrast
      to what is known from the art, the novel construction provides a
      cooling effect which is not only achieved in a most simple manner
      but which is extremely reliable and which is afforded in
      particular for the throat 8 of the nozzle 5, that is that portion
      of the engine which is subjected to the most heating and therefore
      susceptible of the most damage by having the fuel come in contact
      therewith, although in FIG. 5 the lines indicating the fuel flow
      are not shown in actual contact with this inner surface 14a for
      the sake of clarity.<br>
      <br>
      Coming now to the embodiment shown in FIG. 6 it will be seen that
      here the configuration of the combustion chamber 18 is the reverse
      of that in FIG. 5, that is that the combustion chamber diverges
      conically in direction towards the outlet nozzle, rather than away
      therefrom. In this embodiment, also, there are provided a
      plurality of inlet bores 6 for one fuel component and inlet bores
      7 for the other fuel component, with one bore 6 and one bore 7
      always being located in one common transverse plane 20 extending
      transversely of the elongation of the chamber 18. Of course, the
      inlet bores 6 and 7 need not all be located on one side, and the
      construction could be modified so that on one plane 20 the inlet
      bore 6 is located at the left-hand side and on the next plane 20
      the inlet bore 6 is located at the right-hand side of the
      illustration in FIG. 6. In any case, however, each of the inlet
      bores 6 and 7 is controlled by a separate control valve 17 but
      each inlet bore may be separately opened and closed, to thereby
      vary the throughput of fuel and the thrust in simple and highly
      effective manner by adding or taking away the output of individual
      ones of the bores 6 and 7. This control arrangement is the one
      which has been suggested in connection with the embodiment in FIG.
      4, and can of course be employed in that embodiment.<br>
      <br>
      In FIG. 7 I have illustrated a construction wherein the internal
      combustion chamber 22 is of semicircular configuration. All other
      features are the same as in the preceding embodiments, and like
      reference numerals identify like components. The heat flow from
      the nozzle is the same as identified in FIG. 3, and this is true
      in all embodiments already described and those still to be
      discussed. Also, the injection of the fuel fluids is always
      tangential, both in the embodiments which have been discussed here
      before and in those which are still to be described.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 8 shows a construction wherein the combustion chamber 24 is
      of spherical configuration and wherein the front wall portion 3
      can be considered to extend from the region of the inlet bore 6 to
      the region of the inlet bore 7.<br>
      <br>
      In the embodiment shown in FIG. 9 the combustion chamber 26a is
      composed of a series of substantially barrel-shaped sections 26,
      with the injection of fuel fluids taking place through the
      conduits or inlet bores 6 and 7 on three different transverse
      planes 28--each corresponding to one of the barrel-shaped sections
      26 and bisecting the same at its greatest diameter. Each of the
      inlet bores 6 and 7 can of course be separately controlled in the
      same manner as discussed with respect to FIG. 6.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 10 shows a gas generator embodying the present invention. It
      comprises an internal combustion chamber 1 provided with the inlet
      bores 6 and 7 and corresponding to the embodiment illustrated in
      FIG. 1. Reference numeral 32 identifies the outlet nozzle whose
      downstream or outlet end communicates with a second internal
      combustion chamber 30 which again is provided with inlet bores 11
      and 13 for two fuel fluids, both of which are also injected
      tangentially in the same manner as takes place in the chamber 1.
      As mentioned within the discussion of the embodiment in FIG. 1,
      the throat 8 of the outlet nozzle 32 is again so dimensioned that
      its cross-sectional area is much smaller than the cross-sectional
      area of the front wall portion 3 separating the chambers 1 and 30
      from one another, with the flow of conducted heat being
      illustrated by the arrows in FIG. 9, from which it will be seen
      that the heat is here transmitted from the front wall portion 3
      towards the inlet bores 6 and 7 as well as towards the inlet bores
      11 and 13. The gases issuing through the nozzle 32 into the
      chamber 30 encounter additional fuel injected through the inlet
      bores 11 and 13 in a nonstoichiometric relationship, so that the
      hot gases issuing through the nozzle 32 into the chamber 30 are
      strongly cooled. In place of additional fuel, or in addition to
      such additional fuel, it is also possible to inject other means
      serving to cool the hot gases entering the chamber 30 from the
      chamber 1. However, the injection should always take place in the
      vicinity of the front wall portion 3 because this provides for
      additional cooling.<br>
      <br>
      Finally, the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 12 shows an engine
      according to the present invention wherein the internal combustion
      chamber 38 is of substantially lenticular configuration and
      wherein the nozzle 40 is of the type known as a corner expansion
      nozzle. The injection of the propellants through the inlet bores 6
      and 7 is of course again tangentially to the circumference of the
      chamber 38.<br>

      </b>Improvements in or relating to Rocket Engines I, LUTZ TILO
      KAYSER, a Citizen of the Federal Republic of Germany, of Am
      Bismarckturm 10, Germany, do hereby declare the invention, for
      which I pray that a patent may be granted to me, and the method by
      which it is to be performed, to be particularly described in and
      by the following statement: This invention relates to rocket
      engines and provides a method of cooling rocket engine combustion
      chambers for liquid or gaseous propellents and in which mixtures
      of these two types of propellents may be used with the same
      advantage.<br>
      <br>
      For rocket engines, several types of cooling methods and devices
      have already been developed, but they can in no way be considered
      as perfect. The following four main types of cooling systems are
      concerned:<br>
      <br>
      1. The so-called regenerative cooling in which the propellent is
      made, before injection, to absorb the heat transferred to a
      cooling jacket completely enclosing the nozzle and the combustion
      chamber. This process, however, is too complicated for small
      rocket engines and represents an explosion hazard when applied to
      temperature sensitive propellents.<br>
      <br>
      2. In the case of so-called ablative cooling, the entire
      combustion chamber and the nozzle are formed of a material which
      is a poor heat conductor. Also a carbon or a preferably
      fibrereinforced synthetic resin forming a viscous melt may be
      used. The surface of such material assumes the combustion gas
      temperature when the device is in operation, and the heat is
      radiated back to the combustion chamber.<br>
      <br>
      A combustion chamber constructed on this basis, however, involves
      the risk of asymmetrical burning at the nozzle due to fluctuating
      wear phenomena.<br>
      <br>
      3. In so-called film and transpiration cooling, a cooling effect
      of the parts of the wall to be protected is produced by
      introduction of propellents through pores or fine holes along the
      walls of the combustion chamber and the nozzle. Due to the
      expulsion of unconsumed propellent in the boundary layers of the
      flow, a reduction of performance occurs.<br>
      <br>
      4. With the use of so-called radiation cooling, the combustion
      chamber and nozzles must be manufactured from materials having a
      high melting point, since they almost reach the combustion
      temperature and radiate heat to the environment, the surrounding
      parts of the apparatus also being heated.<br>
      <br>
      The above-stated and also other disadvantages are the reasons why
      improved cooling measures and systems for rocket engines are still
      required.<br>
      <br>
      It is a particular problem that in a rocket engine the maximum
      heat transferred from the combustion gases to the wall of the
      combustion chamber occurs at the throat and a small range upstream
      and downstream of the narrowest cross-section thereof.<br>
      <br>
      It is an object of the present invention to avoid or reduce the
      above-stated defects and disadvantages of various known cooling
      systems for rocket engines.<br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, the present invention provides a rocket engine in
      which at least one of the propellent components, for example the
      fuel or the oxidizer, is injected onto an outwardly facing
      concavely curved surface of a toroidal cooling chamber formed
      around the nozzle throat, and from there flows to the inside
      surface of the combustion chamber wall to flow along said wall in
      counterflow to the hot combustion gases, with a film cooling
      effect.<br>
      <br>
      Both the fuel and the oxidizer, or either one of them, may be fed
      into the rocket engine through radially inwardly directed
      injection apertures, or through nozzles.<br>
      <br>
      Both propellents combined, or only one of them may be first
      radially injected from outside on to the outwardly facing
      concavely curved surface of the toroidal cooling chamber formed
      around the nozzle throat. This achieves intensive cooling of this
      part of the nozzle which is most intensely heated from inside.<br>
      <br>
      Regenerative cooling, in the conventional meaning of passing the
      coolant through a narrow gap between two walls, one of which is to
      be cooled, is not used in the present case therefore.<br>
      <br>
      The propellent then flows from the outside of the nozzle, with an
      approximately radiall3 outward flow direction and is forced
      against the concave inner wall of the combustion chamber also by
      centrifugal force, in order to flow along this wall in counterflow
      to the hot combustion gases, with a cooling film effect,
      Combustion begins here, the combustion gases flowing to the centre
      of the chamber and the nozzle and the unburned liquids continuing
      to flow along the wall. A combustion chamber of a rocket engine,
      provided with a cooling system according to the present invention,
      can be constructed as a cone, as a cylinder or as a ring.<br>
      <br>
      Experimental tests have shown that, with higher thrust rocket
      engines, it is an advantage only to inject one component of the
      propellents at the nozzle and to inject the other component into
      the combustion chamber. The feeding of both propellents combined
      at the nozzle throat of a system of comparatively large
      dimensions, results in excessively long mixing paths and
      consequently in premature reaction in the vicinity of the nozzle
      throat, that is to say, it results in a reduced cooling action.<br>
      <br>
      The other propellent component is then fed in counterflow to the
      combustion gases of the combustion chamber tangentially to the
      inside of the wall of the combustion chamber.<br>
      <br>
      In another variation the propellents can be injected with a
      tangential velocity component in addition to their radial velocity
      components in order to further improve the mixing and combustion.<br>
      <br>
      In order that the invention may readily be carried into practice,
      embodiments thereof will now be described in detail, by way of
      example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:<br>
      <b><br>

      </div>
      <br>
      Figure 1 represents the embodiment of a rocket engine. The fuel is
      fed, in this example, through a duct 1 and the oxidizer through a
      duct 2, by way of respective annular propellent passages 3 and 4.
      The two 1 propellents are injected along the sides of an annular
      diaphragm 6, flowing in a radial direction into a cooling chamber
      7, formed as a toroidal cavity around the throat 10 of a nozzle 8.
      Due to the high injection speed and the resultant centrifugal
      force, the liquid and/or gas flow is pressed powerfully against an
      outwardly facing concavely curved surface of the toroidal chamber
      7, as shown in broken lines in Figure 1.<br>
      <br>
      Intensive regenerative cooling is achieved at this part of the
      nozzle, which is most intensely heated at its throat 10.<br>
      <br>
      The cooling action is not achieved by a cooling jacket separating
      the propellents from each other, but the cooling action begins
      only after the injection of the propellents, that is to say, at
      combustion chamber pressure. Thus the action is not regenerative
      cooling, in the conventional manner and the whole injection
      velocity is available for cooling.<br>
      <br>
      The mixed propellents now flow, under the effect of centrifugal
      force, along the inside of the combustion chamber wall 9, in
      counterflow to the combustion gases into the combustion chamber
      12, with a cooling film effect.<br>
      <br>
      They react there with each other and so form the combustion gases,
      which flow out of the nozzle 11. As already mentioned, with
      propellents having a very high reaction speed or with rocket
      engines having higher thrust, it is an advantage to inject only
      one of the two components, in the manner described and to feed the
      other component tangentially to the inside of the combustion
      chamber wall 9.<br>
      <br>
      Figure 2 shows several alternatives of separate propellent
      injection. To avoid ambiguity, it is here emphasized that several
      manners of feeding propellents are illustrated with reference to
      this drawing, only a specific combination being illustrated in
      detail.<br>
      <br>
      In detail the following possibilities of combination are achieved:
      a) One propellent component, for example the fuel, is injected
      radially from outside through a duct 13 onto the outwardly facing
      concavely curved surface of the toroidal cooling chamber, and is
      then diverted towards the inner wall of the combustion chamber, b)
      One component, as described under (a) is injected through the duct
      13, whilst the other component is fed through a duct 15,
      tangentially to the inner surface of the combustion 120 chamber
      wall on the lower side of the combustion chamber.<br>
      <br>
      c) One component is injected through a duct 16, more or less
      inclined onto the outwardly facing concavely curved surface of the
      toroidal cooling chamber, whilst the other component is fed
      through the duct 15 of the combustion chamber.<br>
      <br>
      d) One component is fed through the duct 16 and the other
      component is fed through the duct 14. According to the type of
      application, the duct 14 can be displaced more towards the top of
      the combustion chamber or more towards the underside thereof.<br>
      <br>
      Due to the above-mentioned alternatives of place of the propellent
      injection, the cooling arrangement according to the present
      invention can be adapted to the thrust of the rocket engine and
      the reaction speed of the propellents employed.<br>
      <br>
      In Figure 4, the propellent or propellent components is or are
      supplied through the ducts 17 and 18.<br>
