      <p>The author Crichton E M Miller traces the wheel cross existence
        from Palaeolithic and Neolithic hunter gatherers to stone age
        seafarers and megalith builders who used this instrument in
        combination with zodiacs, henge's, pyramids and water clocks.
        Drawing on scientific, historical and archaeological information
        with appendices from leading scientists and researchers, the
        book traces the tragic occult history of the real cross from the
        burning of Alexandria through to its rediscovery 500 years later
        by the Knights Templars , resulting in excommunication from the
        Roman Catholic Church and eventual torture and destruction of
        the leaders </p>
      <p>The work goes on to reveal the meaning of the heretical
        carvings used by the Freemasons who constructed the Mediaeval
        Cathedrals and churches such as Roslyn Chapel under the noses of
        the Inquisition. </p>
      <p>This work reveals the remarkable qualities and capabilities of
        the wheel cross and Egyptian Cross which is still in the Great
        Pyramid of Khufu as well as its use to find longitude without a
        watch long before Harrison's Chronometer. The work is
        illustrated, referenced and includes all patent drawings to
        allow the reader to experiment and research with one of the most
        secret and forbidden historical and spiritual artefacts&nbsp; to
        be discovered in modern times. </p>
      <p>This is not another novel for the masses such as The Da Vinci
        Code, it is the real thing by the only man in the world that
        owns the patented rights to the working wheel cross and the
        answer to the mysteries of antiquity. </p>

      <p>Weighted so that the bottom of the wheel always points to the
        earths centre, the observer can always measure any angle, from
        the slope of a hill to the declination of a star. </p>
      <p>In this case, the observer is measuring the angle of the rising
        sun whose angle of ascent can be read directly through the
        viewing hole in the cross arm. </p>
      <p>To measure the angles of the topography is just as simple. </p>
      <p>So is sighting along the cross arm and directly reading
        latitude from a pole star. </p>
      <p>Turning the cross on its side allows the observer to
        triangulate any observation mark. </p>
      <p>It is truly a wonderful and unique spherical measuring

      <p>It should be, for it created the Zodiacs and was the instrument

      <p>&nbsp;The author has proved beyond reasonable doubt that
        Ancient mariners could determine longitude by the application of
        simple geometry[1] without the use of a time piece by utilise
        the retrograde action of the moon against the fixed stars. </p>
      <p>Modern longitude was solved by Harrison with his invention of a
        sea going chronometer in the 18th Century followed by the
        invention of the sextant after a prize of £10,000 was set up by
        the British Government. Since that discovery there has been no
        commercial, political or academic reason to investigate other
        methods. </p>
      <p>For prehistoric navigators to achieve longitude by the moon
        required knowledge of mathematical principles found in Nature
        and the application of imagination and ingenuity to invent and
        use rudimentary tools assembled from simple sticks and stones. </p>
      <p>The difficulty is determining which principle came first in the
        historical chain of events and discoveries </p>
      <p><b>Astrology[2]</b> </p>
      <p>The first principle is to create a zodiac[3] of memorable
        constellations on the Ecliptic plane using animism[4] and
        simulacra. </p>
      <p>The second principle is to create a second zodiac of the
        circumpolar stars. </p>
      <p><b>Writing and recording</b> </p>
      <p>The third principle is to create linear symbols to record an
        almanac[5] </p>
      <p><b>An Instrument</b> </p>
      <p>The fourth principle is to create a simple instrument of&nbsp;
        a scale and a plumbline that can take sidereal observations. </p>
      <p><b>A Prime Meridian</b> </p>
      <p>5. The establishment of a prime meridian where watchers or
        astronomer/astrologers create an almanac showing the positions
        of the moon at midnight at that meridian using Draconis and the
        Ecliptic pole against the celestial pole to determine their
        local midnight. See this link. Star clock </p>
      <p>6. By using the position of the Serpent constellation Draconis
        to determine local midnight the navigator can establish their
        local time and if they are east or west of that meridian can
        interpolate the angular difference between the moon and the
        predicted decan or planet in degrees and arc minutes translating
        the difference into distance on the earths surface. </p>
      <p><b>The Method</b> </p>
      <p>The only way to navigate by the moon is to work out the angular
        differential from a star over time and motion with the help of
        an almanac reference. </p>
      <p>This requires tracking the moon along the ecliptic and using
        certain stars in known constellations that the Egyptians called
        a decan of which there were 36 in one complete Zodiac to make up
        360 degrees. </p>
      <p>But that knowledge is insufficient on its own, there is a
        crucial requirement, an instrument of sufficient accuracy. </p>
      <p>The moon tracks over the earth at 720 nautical miles per hour
        and moves against the zodiac (a great circle) 30 arc minutes in
        60 minutes of time during which the position of the observer has
        spun through 900 nautical miles on a great circle. </p>
      <p>To find a longitude position by measuring the angular
        difference requires an accuracy of observation of at least 1 arc
        minute to achieve a longitude accuracy of 15 nautical miles at
        the equator reducing in proportion by latitude. </p>
      <p>An instrument capable of sidereal measurement to1 arc minute
        would result in an accuracy of 7.5 nautical miles at 45ºN. </p>
      <p>The instrument required is known as the Christian Cross with a
        plumbline bisecting the cross bar divided into an exponential
        scale, see this link Sophia for a full explanation. </p>
      <p>A Sextant, octant(18th Century) or quadrant (Greek) can
        potentially achieve that if the latter has a vernier, but they
        are designed to mostly take vertical measurements and not the
        required horizontal ones. See this link Instrument history. </p>
      <p>Crichton E M Miller solved this problem in 1997 with the
        discovery of the cross and plumbline and patented the instrument
        in 2000 and wrote the book The Golden Thread of Time published
        in 2001. </p>

      <p><b>Abstract ---</b> An instrument in the form of a cross with
        an attached scale C of degrees and centrally fixed, weighted
        plumb line or bar F that acts as an indicator.The cross piece B
        acts as a sight and the lower part of the perpendicular upright
        A acts as a fulcrum.Where the upper part of the perpendicular
        upright acts as a further sight line for observing angles
        horizontally. Used for construction projects, navigation,
        astronomy and art. </p>
      <p><b>Description</b> </p>
      <p>This invention relates to devices known as a Traveler,
        Theodolite and sextant for finding levels and angles in
        topography, construction, latitude, star and planetary body
        positions. </p>
      <p>A traveler is used in pipe laying for the finding of levels and
        is a T-shaped device with a plumb line centered in the cross
        piece, which when the plumb line hands at right angles to the
        cross piece this indicates a level gradient. </p>
      <p>Theodolites are used to measure the angles of gradients with
        the use of mirrors and a scale measured in degrees and are
        combined with a sighting pole graded to indicate heights. </p>
      <p>Sextants are similar in design to the theodolite and are used
        to measure the angles of planetary bodies and star positions in
        combination with a published almanac to find latitude and
        longitude for the purpose of navigation. </p>
      <p>Both the Sextant and Theodolite are expensive items requiring
        specialist training and operation. </p>
      <p>A specific embodiment of the invention will now be described by
        way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings in
        which :--- </p>
      <p>According to the present invention there is provided (see
        Figures 1 and 2) </p>
      <p>A. A vertical upright bar to which is attached </p>
      <p>B. A cross piece functioning as a sighting device at right
        angles to the upright. <br>
        The lower part of the upright must act as a fulcrum and be free
        for adjustment. <br>
        The fulcrum may be mounted on an adjustable tripod, hand-held or
        freestanding </p>
      <p>C. Joining the upright and the cross piece is added a scale
        plate which may encompass 360 degrees or any part thereof. </p>
      <p>D. At the center of the cross piece is fixed a nut or bearing.
      </p>
      <p>E. Fixed to the nut or bearing is a plumb line or bar. </p>
      <p>F. Attached to the end of the line or bar is a bob or weight
        which clears the scale plate. </p>
      <p>G. Fixed to the scale plate is a scale measuring degrees,
        minutes and second of arc. This scale is reversible for separate
        applications. (Accuracy is dependent on the overall size of the
        device). </p>
