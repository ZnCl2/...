      </center>
      <p>Cymatics is the study of wave phenomena. It is typically
        associated with the physical patterns produced through the
        interaction of sound waves in a medium. </p>
      <p>A simple experiment demonstrating the visualisation of cymatics
        can be done by sprinkling sand on a metal plate and vibrating
        the plate, for example by drawing a violin bow along the edge,
        the sand will then form itself into standing wave patterns such
        as simple concentric circles. The higher the frequency, the more
        complex the shapes produced, with certain shapes having
        similarities to traditional mandala designs. </p>
      <p><b>History of Cymatics</b> </p>
      <p>The study of the patterns produced by vibrating bodies has a
        venerable history. One of the earliest to notice that an
        oscillating body displayed regular patterns was Galileo Galilei,
        who wrote in his 1632 book, "Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief
        World Systems": </p>
      <p>"As I was scraping a brass plate with a sharp iron chisel in
        order to remove some spots from it and was running the chisel
        rather rapidly over it, I once or twice, during many strokes,
        heard the plate emit a rather strong and clear whistling sound:
        on looking at the plate more carefully, I noticed a long row of
        fine streaks parallel and equidistant from one another. Scraping
        with the chisel over and over again, I noticed that it was only
        when the plate emitted this hissing noise that any marks were
        left upon it; when the scraping was not accompanied by this
        sibilant note there was not the least trace of such marks." </p>
      <p>On July 8, 1680, Robert Hooke was able to see the nodal
        patterns associated with the modes of vibration of glass plates.
        Hooke ran a bow along the edge of a glass plate covered with
        flour, and saw the nodal patterns emerge.[2][3] </p>
      <p>In 1787, Ernst Chladni repeated the work of Robert Hooke and
        published "Entdeckungen über die Theorie des Klanges"
        ("Discoveries in the Theory of Sound"). In this book, Chladni
        describes the patterns seen by placing sand on metal plates
        which are made to vibrate by stroking the edge of the plate with
        a bow. </p>
      <p>The term cymatics was coined by the Swiss scientist, Hans
        Jenny. It is derived from the Greek kyma (????) meaning "wave,"
        and ta kymatika&nbsp; meaning "matters pertaining to waves." </p>
      <p>Cymatics was explored by Jenny in his 1967 book, Kymatik
        (translated Cymatics).[4] Inspired by systems theory and the
        work of Ernst Chladni, Jenny began an investigation of periodic
        phenomena but especially the visual display of sound. He used
        standing waves, piezoelectric amplifiers, and other methods and
        materials. </p>
      <p><b>New Discoveries with Cymatics</b> </p>
      <p>The discovery of a breakthrough technique that involves making
        dolphin and whale sounds visible in water, possibly mimicking
        the very mechanisms that nature evolved in the cetaceans' own
        sound-receiving apparatus, was announced in late 2008 using a
        newly developed instrument, the CymaScope. A team led by Jack
        Kassewitz in the USA and John Stuart Reid in the UK aim to build
        a lexicon of cetacean words, each word having a specific meaning
        and each forming a recognizable pattern, known as a CymaGlyph. </p>
      <p>John Stuart Reid is an English acoustics engineer, scientist
        and inventor. He has studied the world of sound for over 30
        years. He is the inventor of the CymaScope, an innovative
        instrument that makes visible sound’s once hidden structures,
        just as the microscope and the telescope have brought previously
        hidden realms into view. </p>
      <p>Jack Kassewitz's goal is to establish full communication
        between humans and dolphins. Jack's research has propelled him
        to search out and obtain cutting-edge technology in order to
        record cetaceans (dolphins, whales and porpoises) in the
        broadest spectrum and highest definition possible and now make
        them visible with Cymatic images created by John Stuart Reid. </p>
      <p><b>Influences in art</b> </p>
      <p>Jenny's book influenced Alvin Lucier and, along with Chladni,
        helped lead to Lucier's composition Queen of the South. Jenny's
        work was also followed up by Center for Advanced Visual Studies
        (CAVS) founder Gyorgy Kepes at MIT. [5] His work in this area
        included an acoustically vibrated piece of sheet metal in which
        small holes had been drilled in a grid. Small flames of gas
        burned through these holes and thermodynamic patterns were made
        visible by this setup. </p>
      <p>Based on work done in this field, photographer Alexander
        Lauterwasser captures imagery of water surfaces set into motion
        by sound sources ranging from pure sine waves, to music by
        Ludwig van Beethoven, Karlheinz Stockhausen, electroacoustic
        group Kymatik(who often record in surround sound ambisonics),
        and overtone singing. </p>
      <p>In 2007 Thomas J. Mitchell and his son Stuart told the press
        they had decoded "frozen music" based on sculptures in Rosslyn
        Chapel, in part by using cymatics.[6] </p>

        <b>Abstract -</b>-&nbsp; The acoustic device 10 has a diaphragm
        14 extending across a housing 12 to define a chamber 15. When a
        mass of particulate material matter is located on the diaphragm
        14, excitation of the diaphragm 14 by a sound source creates a
        pattern in the particulate matter indicating the property of the
        sound produced by a sound source. A removable sound collector
        60, for delivering sound to the chamber 15, has a connector end
        66 for connection to the housing 12 and a collector end 64 for
        placement next to a sound source such as a loudspeaker. The
        housing 12 may have a number of inlets to which the connector
        end 66, which preferably has a compression fit portion, can be
        connected. The removable sound collector 60 may include a rigid
        tubular section with a curved profile, which reduces in diameter
        from the collector end 64 to the connector end 66. </p>

        <b>Abstract</b> --&nbsp; The present invention provides an
        acoustic display device for displaying modal patterns in
        response to sound from a sound source. The display device (10)
        has a substantially circular housing (12), which housing (12)
        includes a continuous curved side wall (13a), a substantially
        flat base wall (13b), and open end (13c). The open end (13c) is
        closed by diaphragm (14), thereby forming closed chamber (15).
        Excitation of the diaphragm can be effected by introducing vocal
        sounds to the underside of the diaphragm via one of a plurality
        of sound connecting means (22) that include a flexible tubular
        section (30), which terminates in a mouthpiece (32). A user can
        place the mouthpiece over their mouth and nose and make vocal
        sounds, which are delivered to the interior of the chamber
        (15).; The mouthpiece (32) can be substituted with a sound
        collector (60) having a "horn" shape and an annular flange for
        engagement with a loudspeaker. The other ends (24) of the sound
        connecting means (22), within the closed chamber (15), each
        contain a non-return valve so that pressure within the chamber
        is maintained. The device can also include weight locating means
        (21a, 21b, 21c) or magnetic tensioning means (80, 84) for tuning
        the diaphragm. Removable covers having different markings can
        assist in analysing the patterns produced. Two or more integral
        curved spirit levels (38) in conjunction with adjustable feet
        (40) enable accurate levelling of the diaphragm. </p>

        <b>Abstract</b> --&nbsp; Digital images of modal patterns,
        initially derived by digitising and storing the modal phenomena
        of a wide range of audio signals can be viewed in real time on,
        for example, a cathode ray tube, computer monitor, LCD screen,
        plasma monitor, video projector or band-held display device.
        Sound from a live or recorded source can be converted by a
        microphone into a representative electrical audio signal. The
        signal is suitably fed to an analogue-to-digital converter,
        whereupon fit is processed by a computer at a sampling rate of,
        typically, not less than 25 times per second. The wave form of
        the round sample is analysed for its harmonic content and the
        modal pattern image corresponding most closely to the harmonic
        content is released from the device's memory. Thus, a moving set
        of patterns is seen by the viewer in synchronism with the
        recorded or live round source. </p>

        <p><b><font size="+1">Songs From The Sea: Deciphering Dolphin
              Language with Picture Words</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>In an important breakthrough in deciphering dolphin language,
        researchers in Great Britain and the United States have imaged
        the first high definition imprints that dolphin sounds make in
        water. </p>
      <p>The key to this technique is the CymaScope, a new instrument
        that reveals detailed structures within sounds, allowing their
        architecture to be studied pictorially. Using high definition
        audio recordings of dolphins, the research team, headed by
        English acoustics engineer, John Stuart Reid, and Florida-based
        dolphin researcher, Jack Kassewitz, has been able to image, for
        the first time, the imprint that a dolphin sound makes in water.
        The resulting "CymaGlyphs," as they have been named, are
        reproducible patterns that are expected to form the basis of a
        lexicon of dolphin language, each pattern representing a dolphin
        ‘picture word.’ </p>
      <p>Certain sounds made by dolphins have long been suspected to
        represent language but the complexity of the sounds has made
        their analysis difficult. Previous techniques, using the
        spectrograph, display cetacean (dolphins, whales and porpoises)
        sounds only as graphs of frequency and amplitude. The CymaScope
        captures actual sound vibrations imprinted in the dolphin’s
        natural environment—water, revealing the intricate visual
        details of dolphin sounds for the first time. </p>
      <p>Within the field of cetacean research, theory states that
        dolphins have evolved the ability to translate dimensional
        information from their echolocation sonic beam. The CymaScope
        has the ability to visualize dimensional structure within sound.
        CymaGlyph patterns may resemble what the creatures perceive from
        their own returning sound beams and from the sound beams of
        other dolphins. </p>
      <p>Reid said that the technique has similarities to deciphering
        Egyptian hieroglyphs. "Jean-Francois Champollion and Thomas
        Young used the Rosetta Stone to discover key elements of the
        primer that allowed the Egyptian language to be deciphered. The
        CymaGlyphs produced on the CymaScope can be likened to the
        hieroglyphs of the Rosetta Stone. </p>
      <p>Now that dolphin chirps, click-trains and whistles can be
        converted into CymaGlyphs, we have an important tool for
        deciphering their meaning." </p>

      <p>Is there a connection between sound, vibrations and physical
        reality? Do sound and vibrations have the potential to create?
        In this article we will see what various researchers in this
        field, which has been given the name of Cymatics, have
        concluded. </p>
      <p>In 1787, the jurist, musician and physicist Ernst Chladni
        published Entdeckungen über die Theorie des Klangesor
        Discoveries Concerning the Theory of Music.In this and other
        pioneering works, Chladni, who was born in 1756, the same year
        as Mozart, and died in 1829, the same year as Beethoven, laid
        the foundations for that discipline within physics that came to
        be called acoustics, the science of sound. Among Chladni´s
        successes was finding a way to make visible what sound waves
        generate. With the help of a violin bow which he drew
        perpendicularly across the edge of flat plates covered with
        sand, he produced those patterns and shapes which today go by
        the term Chladni figures. (se left) What was the significance of
        this discovery? Chladni demonstrated once and for all that sound
        actually does affect physical matter and that it has the quality
        of creating geometric patterns. </p>
      <p><i>Chladni figures.&nbsp;</i><img src="sci_cym1.gif"
          height="374" width="315"> <br>
        &nbsp; </p>
      <p>What we are seeing in this illustration is primarily two
        things: areas that are and are not vibrating. When a flat plate
        of an elastic material is vibrated, the plate oscillates not
        only as a whole but also as parts. The boundaries between these
        vibrating parts, which are specific for every particular case,
        are called node lines and do not vibrate. The other parts are
        oscillating constantly. If sand is then put on this vibrating
        plate, the sand (black in the illustration) collects on the
        non-vibrating node lines. The oscillating parts or areas thus
        become empty. According to Jenny, the converse is true for
        liquids; that is to say, water lies on the vibrating parts and
        not on the node lines. </p>

        &nbsp; </p>
      <p>In 1815 the American mathematician Nathaniel Bowditch began
        studying the patterns created by the intersection of two sine
        curves whose axes are perpendicular to each other, sometimes
        called Bowditch curves but more often Lissajous figures. (se
        below right) This after the French mathematician Jules-Antoine
        Lissajous, who, independently of Bowditch, investigated them in
        1857-58. Both concluded that the condition for these designs to
        arise was that the frequencies, or oscillations per second, of
        both curves stood in simple whole-number ratios to each other,
        such as 1:1, 1:2, 1:3, and so on. In fact, one can produce
        Lissajous figures even if the frequencies are not in perfect
        whole-number ratios to each other. If the difference is
        insignificant, the phenomenon that arises is that the designs
        keep changing their appearance. They move. What creates the
        variations in the shapes of these designs is the phase
        differential, or the angle between the two curves. In other
        words, the way in which their rhythms or periods coincide. If,
        on the other hand, the curves have different frequencies and are
        out of phase with each other, intricate web-like designs arise.
        These Lissajous figures are all visual examples of waves that
        meet each other at right angles. </p>
      <p><b>Lissajous Figures</b> </p>
      <p>As I pondered the connection between these figures and other
        areas of knowledge, I came to think about the concept that
        exists in many societies and their mythologies around the world,
        which describes the world as a web. For example, many of the
        Mesoamerican people regarded the various parts of the universe
        as products of spinning and weaving: "Conception and birth
        were/.../ compared with the acts of spinning and weaving; all
        the Aztec and Mayan creation and fertility goddesses were
        described as great weavers."(1) A number of waves crossing each
        other at right angles look like a woven pattern, and it is
        precisely that they meet at 90-degree angles that gives rise to
        Lissajous figures. </p>
      <p>In 1967, the late Hans Jenny, a Swiss doctor, artist, and
        researcher, published the bilingual book Kymatik -Wellen und
        Schwingungen mit ihrer Struktur und Dynamik/ Cymatics - The
        Structure and Dynamics of Waves and Vibrations. In this book
        Jenny, like Chladni two hundred years earlier, showed what
        happens when one takes various materials like sand, spores, iron
        filings, water, and viscous substances, and places them on
        vibrating metal plates and membranes. What then appears are
        shapes and motion- patterns which vary from the nearly perfectly
        ordered and stationary to those that are turbulently developing,
        organic, and constantly in motion. </p>
      <p>Jenny made use of crystal oscillators and an invention of his
        own by the name of the tonoscope to set these plates and
        membranes vibrating. This was a major step forward. The
        advantage with crystal oscillators is that one can determine
        exactly which frequency and amplitude/volume one wants. It was
        now possible to research and follow a continuous train of events
        in which one had the possibility of changing the frequency or
        the amplitude or both. </p>
      <p>The tonoscope was constructed to make the human voice visible
        without any electronic apparatus as an intermediate link. This
        yielded the amazing possibility of being able to see the
        physical image of the vowel, tone or song a human being produced
        directly. (se below) Not only could you hear a melody - you
        could see it, too! </p>
      <p>Jenny called this new area of research cymatics, which comes
        from the Greek kyma, wave. Cymatics could be translated as: the
        study of how vibrations, in the broad sense, generate and
        influence patterns, shapes and moving processes. </p>
      <p><b>The Creative Vibration</b> </p>
      <p>What did Hans Jenny find in his investigations? </p>
      <p>In the first place, Jenny produced both the Chladni figures and
        Lissajous figures in his experiments. He discovered also that if
        he vibrated a plate at a specific frequency and amplitude -
        vibration - the shapes and motion patterns characteristic of
        that vibration appeared in the material on the plate. If he
        changed the frequency or amplitude, the development and pattern
        were changed as well. He found that if he increased the
        frequency, the complexity of the patterns increased, the number
        of elements became greater. If on the other hand he increased
        the amplitude, the motions became all the more rapid and
        turbulent and could even create small eruptions, where the
        actual material was thrown up in the air. <br>

          src="cym_fig2.gif" height="269" width="518"> </p>
      <p>The shapes, figures and patterns of motion that appeared proved
        to be primarily a function of frequency, amplitude, and the
        inherent characteristics of the various materials. He also
        discovered that under certain conditions he could make the
        shapes change continuously, despite his having altered neither
        frequency nor amplitude! </p>
      <p><i>The vowel A in sand&nbsp;</i><img src="sci_cym3.gif"
          height="358" width="358"> </p>
      <p>When Jenny experimented with fluids of various kinds he
        produced wave motions, spirals, and wave-like patterns in
        continuous circulation. In his research with plant spores, he
        found an enormous variety and complexity, but even so, there was
        a unity in the shapes and dynamic developments that arose. With
        the help of iron filings, mercury, viscous liquids, plastic-like
        substances and gases, he investigated the three-dimensional
        aspects of the effect of vibration. </p>
      <p>In his research with the tonoscope, Jenny noticed that when the
        vowels of the ancient languages of Hebrew and Sanskrit were
        pronounced, the sand took the shape of the written symbols for
        these vowels, while our modern languages, on the other hand, did
        not generate the same result! How is this possible? Did the
        ancient Hebrews and Indians know this? Is there something to the
        concept of "sacred language," which both of these are sometimes
        called? What qualities do these "sacred languages," among which
        Tibetan, Egyptian and Chinese are often numbered, possess? Do
        they have the power to influence and transform physical reality,
        to create things through their inherent power, or, to take a
        concrete example, through the recitation or singing of sacred
        texts, to heal a person who has gone "out of tune"? </p>

      <p>An interesting phenomenon appeared when he took a vibrating
        plate covered with liquid and tilted it.The liquid did not yield
        to gravitational influence and run off the vibrating plate but
        stayed on and went on constructing new shapes as though nothing
        had happened. If, however, the oscillation was then turned off,
        the liquid began to run, but if he was really fast and got the
        vibrations going again, he could get the liquid back in place on
        the plate. According to Jenny, this was an example of an
        antigravitational effect created by vibrations. </p>
      <p><b>Universality?</b> </p>
      <p>In the beginning of Cymatics, Hans Jenny says the following:
        "In the living as well as non-living parts of nature, the
        trained eye encounters wide-spread evidence of periodic systems.
        These systems points to a continuous transformation from the one
        set condition to the opposite set."(3) Jenny is saying that we
        see everywhere examples of vibrations, oscillations, pulses,
        wave motions, pendulum motions, rhythmic courses of events,
        serial sequences, and their effects and actions. Throughout the
        book Jenny emphasises his conception that these phenomena and
        processes not be taken merely as subjects for mental analysis
        and theorizing. Only by trying to "enter into"phenomena through
        empirical and systematic investigation can we create mental
        structures capably of casting light on ultimate reality. He asks
        that we not "mix ourselves in with the phenomenon"but rather pay
        attention to it and allow it to lead us to the inherent and
        essential. He means that even the purest philosophical theory is
        nevertheless incapable of grasping the true existence and
        reality of it in full measure. </p>
      <p>What Hans Jenny pointed out is the resemblance between the
        shapes and patterns we see around us in physical reality and the
        shapes and patterns he generated in his investgations. Jenny was
        convinced that biological evolution was a result of vibrations,
        and that their nature determined the ultimate outcome. He
        speculated that every cell had its own frequency and that a
        number of cells with the same frequency created a new frequency
        which was in harmony with the original, which in its turn
        possibly formed an organ that also created a new frequency in
        harmony with the two preceding ones. Jenny was saying that the
        key to understanding how we can heal the body with the help of
        tones lies in our understanding of how different frequencies
        influence genes, cells and various structures in the body. He
        also suggested that through the study of the human ear and
        larynx we would be able to come to a deeper understanding of the
        ultimate cause of vibrations. </p>
      <p><b>Trinity</b> </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="sci_cymatics4.jpg" height="326" width="350"></p>
      </center>
      <p>In the closing chapter of the book Cymatics, Jenny sums up
        these phenomena in a three-part unity. The fundamental and
        generative power is in the vibration which, with its
        periodicity, sustains phenomena with its two poles. At one pole
        we have form, the figurative pattern. At the other is motion,
        the dynamic process. </p>
      <p>These three fields - vibration and periodicity as the ground
        field, and form and motion as the two poles - constitute an
        indivisible whole, Jenny says, even though one can dominate
        sometimes. Does this trinity have something within science that
        corresponds? Yes, according to John Beaulieu, American polarity
        and music therapist. In his book Music and Sound in the Healing
        Arts,he draws a comparison between his own three-part structure,
        which in many respects resembles Jenny´s, and the conclusions
        researchers working with subatomic particles have reached.
        "There is a similarity between cymatic pictures and quantum
        particles. In both cases that which appeares to be a solid form
        is also a wave. They are both created and simultaneously
        organized by the principle of pulse (Read:principle of
        vibration). This is the great mystery with sound: there is no
        solidity! A form that appears solid is actually created by a
        underlying vibration."(4) In an attempt to explain the unity in
        this dualism between wave and form, physics developed the
        quantum field theory, in which the quantum field, or in our
        terminology, the vibration, is understood as the one true
        reality, and the particle or form, and the wave or motion, are
        only two polar manifestations of the one reality, vibration,
        says Beaulieu. </p>
      <p>In conclusion, I would like to cite Cathie E. Guzetta´s poetic
        contemplation of where the investigation of the relationship
        between sound and the arising of various life forms might lead
        us in the future: "The forms of snowflakes and faces of flowers
        may take on their shape because they are responding to some
        sound in nature. Likewise, it is possible that crystals, plants,
        and human beings may be, in some way, music that has taken on
        visible form."(5) </p>
      <p>Disclaimer! The quotes from Hans Jenny´s book Cymaticsis not

        the author of the article doesn´t have access to the book in
        question for the moment, but he´s working on it. Although the

      <p>Piezoelectric Cymatics Experiment --- A simple vibrating
        platform can be made from a piezoelectric sounder mounted on a
        plastic tube. The piezo sounder can be connected to a signal
        generator or even a PC sound card. By placing a small amount of
        powder or fluid on the sounder, various patterns and motions can
        be seen depending upon the applied frequencies. </p>
      <p>This image shows a pattern formed by a fine powder vibrating at
        a single, mid audio range frequency. Depending upon the size of
        your sounder and the materials used, the patterns will emerge at
        a range of frequencies. </p>
      <p>Sometimes a pattern will only remain stable at one exact
        frequency, whereas other patterns will emerge over a broad range
        frequencies. By mixing signals together more complex patterns
        can be formed. If you don't have signal generators handy try
        using classical music as it contains a great deal of harmonics
        and mathematical ratios within the sounds. Other types of music
        may work too, but the drum beats tend to destabilize the
        patterns. </p>

      <p>Different materials will respond in different ways to the
        vibrations due to varying density or particle size and shape.
        Materials can also be separated or made to flow through each
        other. </p>
      <p>Diagram of Cymatics Display deviceThis diagram shows a flat
        Piezo sounder glued to the top of a small section of tubing for
        support. The connecting wires should be supported by attaching
        them to the tube. It is important that the wires are not tight
        as they may prevent the piezo sounder from oscillating fully.
        The wires can then be connected to an signal generator such as
        the DIY signal generator, power pulse modulator, or even a PC
        headphone output. </p>
      <p>There should only be a pinch of powder such as salt placed on
        the sounder to see the effect. The sound should be adjusted
        whilst watching the surface to see how it responds. Make sure
        the sounder is as level as possible otherwise the powder will
        slide off before any patterns are formed. </p>
      <p>You may notice that a certain frequencies the powder will jump
        into the air quite suddenly, destroying any patterns. This
        occurs due to resonance, and turing down the volume should allow
        you to form patterns at the resonant frequencies. </p>
      <p>Liquids will form patterns with a very high resolution. High
        audio frequencies can create very fine pattern, barley visible
        to the naked eye. A laser beam, reflected by the vibrating
        surface can be used to magnify the effect. The reflected laser
        beam can produce an image on a screen, which will represent the
        vibrating surface. </p>
      <p>The projected images can look like 3D holograms, and it is
        often quite difficult to see how the projected pattern relates
        to the actual pattern on the reflective material. </p>
      <p>You can make much larger versions of this project using a
        speaker with a flat playe replacing part of the cone. Details
        are shown in the comments section below. To drive a speaker you
        will need an amplifier to give a good supply of power to the
        speaker. An alternative is to use a high power signal generator
        such as a power pulse controller. </p>
      <p>If the piezo transducer is driven at very high, or ultrasonic
        frequencies, and with a large amplitude it is possible to
        'atomize' liquids such as water. This creates a fine mist that
        resembles steam in appearance. Such mists are actually tiny
        droplets suspended in the air yet they behave as if they were
        all part of a single dense fluid medium. </p>
      <p>Some patterns will only form at specific frequencies, so
        adjustments need to be made quite slowly in order to observe the
        effect. </p>
      <p>At certian frequencies the surface used will resonate, and this
        will produce very pronounced movements. It's even possible to
        cause all your particles to leap up and off the surface. <br>
        A simple test may be to add a pinch of salt to the surface, then
        brifly sweep through your frequency range. If at no point do the
        salt particles leap up, or make any large motion, you should
        assume that the vibrations are too weak, or that the material is
        damping the standing waves. </p>
      <p>Also, square waves will cause harmonic vibrations too. This
        means for example; Your square wave input is 1 kHz, you will see
        2 kHz, 3 kHz, etc as vibrations, but the harmonics are of lower
        amplitude. These harmonics may help or hinder the pattern
        formation. <br>
        With a sine wave, you have more precise control, but you will
        only see simple cricles as the pattern. </p>
      <p>I noticed one particularly interesting effect when using salt
        particles on a piezo sounder. Very occasionaly a lone salt
        crystal would begin to move along the surface, gradually
        disintegrating and leaving a trail behind it. </p>

        <p><img src="chladni.jpg" height="181" width="150"></p>
      </center>
      <p>Ernst Florens Friedrich Chladni,&nbsp; November 30, 1756 –
        April 3, 1827) was a German physicist and musician. </p>
      <p>Chladni was born in Wittenberg. His important works include
        research on vibrating plates and the calculation of the speed of
        sound for different gases. For this some call him the "Father of
        Acoustics". He also did pioneering work in the study of
        meteorites, and therefore is regarded by some as the "Father of
        Meteoritics" as well. </p>
      <p>One of Chladni's most well known achievements was inventing a
        technique to show the various modes of vibration in a mechanical
        surface. Chladni repeated the pioneering experiments of Robert
        Hooke of Oxford University. On July 8, 1680, Hooke had been able
        to see the nodal patterns associated with the modes of vibration
        of glass plates. Hooke ran a bow along the edge of a glass plate
        covered with flour, and saw the nodal patterns emerge. </p>
      <p>Chladni's technique, first published in 1787 his book,
        Entdeckungen über die Theorie des Klanges ("Discoveries in the
        Theory of Sound"), consists of drawing a bow over a piece of
        metal whose surface is lightly covered with sand. The plate is
        bowed until it reaches resonance and the sand forms a pattern
        showing the nodal regions . Since the 20th century it has become
        more common to place a loudspeaker driven by an electronic
        signal generator over or under the plate to achieve a more
        accurate adjustable frequency. </p>
      <p>Variations of this technique are commonly used in the design
        and construction of acoustic instruments such as violins,
        guitars, and cellos. </p>
