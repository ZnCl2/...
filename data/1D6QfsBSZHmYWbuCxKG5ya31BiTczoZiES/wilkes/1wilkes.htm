      </center>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As basic as the lever or
          pulley, the simple concept called "Rolamite" promises a
          revolution in mechanical design.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">What's a Rolamite? It looks
          like a simple gadget made with two rollers and a steel band,
          but it's much more. As basic as the wheel, the lever, or the
          hinge, it is the only elementary machine discovered this
          century. Its use will be widespread --- in everything from
          switches, thermostats, and valves to pumps and clutches, and
          as almost frictionless bearings.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The Rolamite concept is the
          invention of Donald F. Wilkes, a Sandia Corp. engineer who was
          studying a suspensions system made with a bent elastic band
          fastened to opposing surfaces in an S shape. He found that the
          center of the loop could be moved horizontally with amazingly
          little resistance (To try it, clamp one end of a steel tape to
          a table and another section to a ruler held horizontally above
          it).</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">But the band can provide no
          positive mechanical action. In a flash of genius, Wilkes
          inserted two rollers, large enough to overlap and so key
          themselves in, and the Rolamite principle was born. The
          rollers may move in a fixed frame or one of the horizontal
          frame members may move on the rollers, travel being limited by
          the length of the band.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As the rollers are pushed to
          the right, for example, they turn in opposite directions, but
          are always in rolling contact with the band. Nothing slides,
          rubs, or slips; it is always the same points that come into
          contact between roller and band. And a rolamite unit never
          needs lubrication.</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Prepackaged Energy</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">What about band-flexing? It
          would seem that takes energy, creating friction. But that
          energy is prepackaged when the band is installed under
          tension. Bending of one part of the band is accompanied by
          straightening of another, which supplies the needed energy.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In tests, Rolamite devices
          display friction of an amazingly low order --- one to ten
          percent of that in the best ball and roller bearings of
          similar capacity.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The Rolamite units closest
          to production are designed for light loads and such jobs as
          opening and closing contacts or valves or performing
          mechanical operations. A rolling frame member might carry
          control studs, fluidic valves, or printed circuit contacts on
          its outer surface.</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Tricks with Bands &amp;
            Rollers</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Instead of being uniform,
          bands can introduce more or less resistance at some point of
          roller travel. Holes of various shapes can be punched in them
          to make action easier at a predetermined point and to a
          precise degree. Bimetallic elements and springs, even cloth,
          plastic, or rubber bands can be used.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Such modification can
          produce a snap action, sudden braking, latching, and other
          control functions. A sharply bent band can act as a detent.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Rollers can be fitted with
          bulges or rubber stops for positive braking. The rollers can
          be of different sizes. If one is smaller, it turns faster than
          the other and you have a speed-changing device. Extra rollers
          may be added, always two at a time. They may be spool-shaped
          with a moving table between them. Even square and triangular
          rollers are possible.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Fascinated by the
          possibilities, Wilkes and other Sandia people have doodles up
          Rolamite light switches, fishing reels, vibrationless sanders,
          clutches, a greatly improved toilet valve, an odometer, a
          reciprocating variable-speed tool drive, and even a
          pellet-shooting toy gun. There's no end in sight.</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Basic rolamite uses a
          flexible band of steel or other material curled in an S shape
          and forming a freely moving loop. Two rollers are then
          inserted and the band is put under tension. Roller cluster
          moves along band with amazingly little friction. By making
          cuts in bands, roller action can be that of snap-action
          switch, a thermostat (when a bimetallic band is used), or any
          of at least 50 other devices. It can support a traveling table
          for example. Square and triangular rollers are even possible.</font>

      </center>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">One night in September 1966,
          a lean young, sandy-haired engineer named Donald Wilkes went
          into his garage workshop in Albuquerque NM to try an idea.
          What came out several hours later has been hailed as the first
          truly elementary mechanical invention of the 20th century.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Dubbed the Rolamite, it's an
          almost frictionless bearing with countless applications in
          modern devices ranging from toasters to space vehicles.
          Engineers say it will take its place alongside the wheel,
          lever, and spring as a fundamental discovery of major
          significance.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Basically, the Rolamite
          consists of two rollers held in a track on opposite sides of
          an S-shaped band of springy metal, the rollers glide
          effortlessly in the track because the band moves with them as
          they roll along. Since the band and rollers are both moving at
          the same speed, there is no slip or drag between them and
          therefore virtually no friction. The device is so versatile it
          can function as a switch, a valve, a pump, a fuse, a
          thermostat, a force amplifier, a clutch, a speed changer, a
          brake, a pressure-sensing control, a solenoid, a fire alarm a
          --- you name it and it'll do it.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">How could such a fundamental
          principle remain so long undiscovered? That was the first
          question I tossed at Donald Wilkes as I interviewed him
          recently in his equipment-crammed laboratory at Sandia Corp.,
          the nuclear weaponry development center that Western Electric
          runs for the AEC.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"It's hard to believe",
          answered the 37-year-old inventor, who has been an avid PM
          reader since he was a boy. "The amazing thing is that a
          caveman has all the materials for making a Rolamite. Logs
          could have served for rollers and vines for the bands."</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">So how had Wilkes come to
          invent the Rolamite? In the course of his missile work at
          Sandia, he had tinkered together a suspension system that
          particularly intrigued him. It consisted of a flexible metal
          band fastened in an S shape between two parallel surfaces. It
          was responsive to movements, all right --- too responsive.
          "Wiggly and wobbly", Wilkes describes it.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">On that now-momentous night,
          Wilkes was relaxing in his living room when it hit him. How
          about putting rollers in the curves of the S? He jumped up and
          rushed out to his workshop. From his stock of scrap he
          fashioned a simple track and inserted a strip of beryllium
          copper he'd been carrying around in his pocket. From these
          components, he made the first Rolamite.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Now, Wilkes wondered, what
          would happen when he tipped the thing so that the rollers
          moved? Would the rollers slide along the curves of the band,
          or would the band move right along with the rollers with no
          slipping? Wilkes knew that if the band slipped he had nothing.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Again and again Wilkes tried
          it, his excitement growing. The rollers moved smoothly and the
          band went right with them. There was no detectable slip. The
          next morning he hurried to his lab to machine a more
          sophisticated model. Sensitive tests confirmed the
          observations made with the first crude model. There was no
          slipping and, therefore, little friction.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As development work went on,
          Wilkes and fellow researchers discovered that an almost
          infinite number of variations could be made by changing the
          shape, size and structure of the bands, rollers and tracks.
          Take the band, for example. So long as it's under the same
          tension throughout its length, the rollers are stable at any
          point in the track. It takes just as much force to push them
          one way as the other way. But if you cut a slot in the band,
          you weaken it at that point, creating what is called a force
          bias --- the rollers are made to "prefer" a particular point
          in the band.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">To understand the effect of
          a slot in the band, think of the two loops of the S as springs
          that each exert a force against the other. Like a coiled watch
          spring, the band wants to lie flat and thus stores energy when
          it is forced to bend around the rollers.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When one of the loops is
          weakened by having a slot cut in it, the other loop overpowers
          it and "unwinds", pulling the rollers with it. By cutting a
          long, tapered slot in the band, the rollers can be made to
          move the entire length of the track under their own power
          since the band becomes progressively weaker toward the widest
          end of the slot.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In a typical application,
          Wilkes visualizes a Rolamite with a slotted band to lick one
          common household annoyance --- the leaky toilet valve. The
          leakiness usually results from the failure of the ball float
          and lever mechanism to generate enough pressure to close the
          water-supply valve. The force generated in a slotted Rolamite
          lever would close the valve with 30 times the strength of
          present valves.</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Rollers can be Different
            Sizes</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Wilkes' first Rolamite used
          equal-sized rollers, but he soon found that one roller in a
          pair could be a giant, 10 or more times bigger than its
          companion. With rollers of different sizes, you get a
          remarkably simple speed changer that can be used in any number
          of mechanisms.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Perhaps the oddest discovery
          is that the rollers need not be round. Sandia researchers have
          tried triangular, hexagonal, oval and polygonal rollers. The
          basic principles of the Rolamite still apply just as with
          round rollers. The different shapes of rollers give the
          Rolamite many additional functions. For instance, a
          rectangular roller can be designed to lodge against a stop in
          a braking mechanism.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A lot of variations are
          possible in the track, too. For example, a track wider at one
          end&nbsp; makes the Rolamite a powerful force amplifier ---
          energy is released when the rollers slip into the wider
          portion of the frame. This energy can actuate a variety of
          mechanisms, such as a firing pin or a switch.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">There are other advantages,
          too. Many Rolamited devices would never need a drop of oil.
          Then there's smoothness of operation. The steady, uniform
          operation of a Rolamite can take the jerks out of pop-up
          toasters, power sanders and a host of other devices.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">There's cost. Wilkes
          estimates that the Rolamite will actually reduce costs in 75%
          of its applications. The Rolamite does not require close
          tolerances, so they're cheaper to make. Finally, there's the
          all-around toughness. Extreme heat, cold or exposure to
          weather won't affect Rolamite operation.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">But, I wondered, doesn't all
          that flexing of the band cause it to wear out eventually?
          Doesn't metal fatigue cause it to break? Those were questions
          that bothered Sandia engineers too, at the beginning. Now
          they've quit worrying. The beryllium copper bands used in
          Rolamite have proved to be so sturdy that they show no sign of
          metal fatigue after 1,000,000 flexures. At that rate, the
          engineers figure, the band in a Rolamited home light switch
          operated 10 times a day would last 300 years. A Rolamited
          bathroom scale used five times a day would not wear out in 600
          years.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">You'll never see the first
          applications of Rolamite because they're tucked away in secret
          weaponry made by Sandia engineers. But hundreds of industries
          are embarking on crash programs to adapt the Rolamite.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Because Rolamite was
          developed with the help of tax dollars, it is available to the
          public. The Atomic Energy Commission will grant a royalty-free
          license for its manufacture to anyone interested. Wilkes
          himself now heads a new company set up to speed the Rolamite
          revolution along.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"We've just begun to scratch
          the surface", Wilkes says. "Just wait until the independent
          inventors get going."</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">How the Rolamite Works</font></b>
      </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="1pm1.jpg" height="218" width="625"></p>
      </center>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Basic Rolamite consists of
          two rollers in a track with an S-shaped band of springy metal
          between them. As the rollers move, the band unwinds off one
          and winds onto the other simultaneously. Because the rollers
          and band are always traveling together at the same speed,
          there is no friction between them and they move with little
          effort. The two loops of the S are constantly fighting each
          other to unwind and lie flat. So long as the band is uniformly
          springy, the loops balance each other and the rollers remain
          at rest. When you cut a tapered slot in the band, the band
          gets progressively weaker as the slot gets wider. The portion
          of band curled around the upper roller is always stronger than
          the portion around the lower roller. The upper loop thus
          overpowers the lower one and unwinds, pulling the rollers with
          it. This is one of a number of ways a Rolamite can be made to
          provide motion of its own.</font> </p>

            Device</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The Rolamite geometry,
          developed over the past year by the author, forms a simple
          mechanical design element which may, with variations, be used
          to advantage in a multitude of applications in place of
          traditional elements such as gears, pistons, pumps, switches,
          springs, levers, latches, brakes, clutches, and valves.</font>
      </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">From Basic Idea</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The basic rolamite geometry,
          Figure 1, also shown diagrammatically on the next page,
          consists of two rollers mounted inside a parallel-surface
          channel and held together in a free-rolling cluster by a
          flexible band under tension. This arrangement constrains the
          rollers to counter-rotate without slipping as the cluster
          moves along the channel, thereby providing the close-couples
          geometry which can be exploited to perform many functions.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The two-roller cluster is
          free to transverse from left to right, practically without
          friction. Surface velocities between the rollers and the band
          are equal; hence there is no sliding friction, at least on a
          macroscopic scale. Tests on models have shown that
          coefficients of friction as low as 0.0005 are achievable. This
          is about an order of magnitude better than the best ball or
          roller bearings.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><b>Figure 1:</b> The Basic
          Rolamite Mechanism ~ An S-shaped band of springy metal
          (represented by the white strip) is constrained by two guides
          and two rollers. The rollers are free to move, the band
          winding off one and on onto the other at the same time. The
          band itself must be under the other one at the same time. The
          band itself must be under tension, thus the ends usually are
          permanently fastened in some manner. There is virtually no
          friction. Since the band and rollers are moving at the same
          speed, and there is no slippage between them, since the band
          tension creates a tight wrap-around. Each half of the S tends
          to unwind, but since they are balanced the cluster remains at
          rest unless an outside force acts on it. This equilibrium can
          be disturbed by changing portions of the band (varying width,
          thickness, performing, etc.) and the cluster will then move by
          itself.</font> </p>

      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">To Sophisticated
            Applications</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Out of this basic
          arrangement, an almost unlimited variety of mechanical devices
          can be developed. Force amplification, detenting mechanisms,
          braking and clutching, sequencing, pumping fluids, temperature
          sensing, electrical contacts -- the list could go on and on.
          There are, however, three distinct areas for its use: (a)
          those where the geometry not only forms the heart or essence
          of the device, but also provides most of the necessary
          additional functions as well; (b) where the geometry forms the
          backbone but not the whole mechanism; and (c) where the device
          would be used as a separate subcomponent building block for
          use in other systems. Table 1 shows applications for these
          three areas.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Consideration of the
          following attributes may help the designer to realize the
          rolamite's possibilities: (a) its low coefficients of
          friction, which enable most devices to operate sensitively and
          reliably for long periods of time with a minimum of
          lubrication; (b) its ability to produce many types of
          force-deflection characteristics; (c) its capability of
          providing a great many mechanical and electromechanical
          functions; (d) its applicability to countless distinct devices
          ranging from kitchen appliances to outer space
          instrumentation; (e) its adaptability for use in components of
          all sizes -- large to microminiature; (f) its simplicity,
          which allows the design of complete mechanical and
          electromechanical assemblies with very few piece-parts ---
          rarely more than 10; (g) its applicability to modern
          manufacturing techniques such as chemical etching and
          continuous-strip processing; and (i) its relative freedom from
          critical manufacturing tolerances.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">High-speed set-up or
          step-down ratios can be obtained from the rolamite geometry.
          High torques can be transmitted without slippage because the
          normal forces and tensions can be made relatively large
          without introducing severe frictional losses, and normal
          bearing reaction friction losses are not present.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Consider the rolamite
          inertial odometer (doubly integrating accelerometer) shown as
          in Figure 2. This type of device is capable of inertially
          measuring up to several miles of vehicle travel in a single
          stage and, because of the low coefficients of friction, doing
          it very accurately. Most other types of inertial odometers
          (such as the spur gear arrangement shown above as Figure 3)
          must support the flywheel element or its equivalent in
          bearings in the acceleration field, making it very difficult
          to keep frictional influences negligible. However, in the
          rolamite odometer no friction is added to the cluster by the
          vehicle acceleration.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In addition, the rolamite
          can accomplish 220-to-1 or 300-to-1 speed step-ups in a single
          stage, whereas three stages of spur gearing would be required.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><b>Figure 2:</b> Rolamite
          Inertial Odometer ~ By attaching a small rolamite roller to a
          large heavily rim-weighted flywheel, the linear acceleration
          of the roller centerline can be very small compared to vehicle
          acceleration. Since this type of device is a doubly
          integrating accelerometer, vehicle displacement is
          proportional to cluster displacement. A typical value is 8.5 x
          204; thus if the driving roller in the figure move 2 inches,
          it would represent a vehicle travel of 2.7 miles (2" x 8.5 x
          104). Because of low friction, it can be done very accurately.</font>

          supported in bearings which, when subjected to acceleration
          forces, become friction bound. In order to scale down motion,
          many gear stags are needed, further compounding the friction
          problem. And accuracy suffers.</font> </p>

      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The Production Factor</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The rolamite geometry forms
          a mechanical suspension system capable of achieving
          substantial reductions in friction in the realm of extremely
          low bearing pressures. Devices based on the rolamite concept
          may be dramatically simple and easily microminiaturized,
          tolerant of production variations, and inherently capable of a
          great many of the functions required in electromechanical
          devices (Figure 4).</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><b>Figure 4:</b> Using the
          Rolamite Principle</font> </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="0me4.jpg" height="488" width="575"></p>
      </center>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Rolamite devices can produce
          any type of force-deflection characteristic. Without adding
          more parts to a device, it is possible to obtain constant
          force levels, positive and negative spring constants, second
          order and higher force curves, detenting actions, etc., in any
          desired combination. These forces may be highly localized or
          distributed. Reasonably, sharp step functions and sinusoids
          are also obtainable.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The negative spring
          characteristics obtainable with the rolamite geometry are of
          particular interest. In the past the designer has been limited
          to the use of permanent magnets, buckling helical springs, and
          other rather indirect and imprecise methods, difficult to
          analyze and not accurately predictable, to achieve sharp
          breakaway or hair-trigger action. With rolamite, negative
          spring-constant or other negative force-deflection action can
          be achieved in exactly the right way with no additional parts.
          This opens up new fields for mechanical amplifiers,
          oscillators, and motion detectors, and may permit cheaper
          mechanical devices to replace magnets in many applications.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">With rolamite the designer
          can incorporate the precise amount of viscoeleastic damping or
          coulomb friction desired, either continuously or as a function
          of displacement; he may directly clutch or brake a roller or
          both rollers, or provide overriding action or a local
          uncoupling; produce sequencing, extremely high direct speed or
          torque changes, maximum-minimum limit-stops, squeezing,
          latching, insertion, pullaway action, and recording.</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The Beauty of the Band</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It is indeed fortuitous that
          the key element in the rolamite geometry is the band, because,
          of all the engineering materials, thin metals are second only
          to tiny wires ad whiskers in excellence of mechanical
          properties, while concurrently they are optimal for one of the
          best manufacturing processes available --- chemical etching.
          This single element can provide forces, electrical circuitry,
          electrical contacting, programmed fluid resistance, sliding,
          latching, releasing, differential detenting, sequencing,
          maximum-minimum recording, differential action, sealing,
          metering, insulating, viscoelasticity, bimetallic behavior,
          etc. Although the band profile can be complex, the
          chemical-etching process requires only that a few master
          patterns be generated. Hence many of the aforesaid functions
          are obtainable at a low cost.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The suspension, bearing, and
          force features of rolamites are definite advantages. More
          important, however, is the versatile way the rolamite geometry
          can produce nearly all known mechanical and electromechanical
          functions in a wide variety of combinations using very few
          piece-parts (usually 4 to 10). This design versatility and
          economy stems from the many types of motion directly
          obtainable from the cluster, manufacturing tolerance and
          adjustability, and the simple, adaptable elements used.
          Although the rolamite geometry looks somewhat less promising
          for recirculating rotary speed changes and bearings, the
          lessons learned from the rolamite geometry relative to tip
          guidance, rolling separators, friction control through the
          angle of repose, and the value of compliant behavior could
          well point the way to greatly improved high speed rotary
          devices, ones which could operate without lubrication for long
          periods of time and which could be more economically
          manufactured than existing devices.</font> </p>

      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When the roller cluster is
          locked between the guide surfaces by sufficient band tension,
          and permitted to roll enough to relive forces induced by the
          tensioning process, the roller axes are perfectly parallel
          with each other and with the guide surfaces; therefore, the
          entire geometry is placed with its preferred minimum energy
          state (pure rolling state) because the tension in the band is
          at a minimum.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This rolling state is
          assured by the laws of flexure so that there need be no
          slippage between the band and rollers or between the band and
          guide surfaces as the locked geometry is rolled. Since the
          band tensions and the elastic strains induced in the band when
          it is bent around the rollers are equal and opposite, and
          because the rate at which strain energy is entering and
          leaving the band area adjacent to each of the rollers is
          constant, no net axial force is exhibited by the cluster ---
          that is, the cluster is essentially in neutral equilibrium at
          any position along the horizontal x-axis within the confines
          of the band and the guide surfaces. This balance is
          independent of the roller diameter.</font> </p>

      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><i>Constraints:</i>
          Constraints are imposed on the geometry for several reasons:
          (a) Most commonly, the desire to insure fully elastic behavior
          in the band without any plastic deformation; (b) some minimum
          endurance limit on the number of cycles the geometry may
          undergo; or (c) the limitation of some feature in the locking
          cluster geometry. For simplicity, the following analysis is
          limited to cases where the band thickness t is constant
          throughout the working portion of the band.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In order to insure fully
          elastic behavior or some minimum endurance level for the band,

          strains induced by initial tensioning, induced loadings, or
          through Poison's ratio effects due to normal loadings, must be
          kept below some maximum level.</font> </p>

          other terms until the design is approaching final form, at
          which time it will be easy to include approximations of these
          other terms.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">To further simplify the
          following discussion, the assumption will be made that the
          band is perfectly flexible, that is, it has not flexural
          stiffness. The constraints imposed by the free-rolling locked
          cluster are: First, s - 3t (Figure 1) must be greater than the
          diameter of the largest roller, or interference will occur.
          Mathematically stated, this constraint is:</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><i>Static Equilibrium:</i>
          Cluster equilibrium requires that the moment induced by the
          nonaligned band tensions T must be counteracted by an equal
          and opposite moment induced by normal forces <i>N</i>, as
          shown in Figure 5. This requirement is expressed as</font> </p>

          real band has flexural stiffness, and a real rolamite
          arrangement need not be tight in order to present a true

          pull a real band into true parallel tangency with a pulley,

          An essentially tight geometry occurs when the tangent lines

          acceleration. Most of these methods permit the attainment of

          shown in Figure 15 is to flatten an area on the surface of one
          roller so that the normal force induced by the band tension at
          the point of tangency of the roller and guide surface can be
          used to provide a breakaway force level. The rear roller is
          the preferred location for frictional locking to occur during
          breakaway. If desired, an adjustable stop can be used to rock
          the roller forward and partly out f the detent notch to
          diminish the breakaway level for calibration purposes. One
          such arrangement is shown in Figure 16.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Accurate and repeatable
          breakaway level detent action is obtained by using detents
          which are provided by a negative spring-constant region

          may be achieved by such means as cutouts in the band or
          preformed curves. Of course, the steeper the negative slope
          region, the sharper the breakaway action. Once the set force
          level is exceeded, there is clearly an excess of force.</font>

          Stopping the roller cluster directly by over-roller or

          high-shock situation in which the cluster must not impact
          against the end of the device. For example, in over-roller
          braking, the bar wedges between the upper side of the roller
          and the wall, providing quick friction braking. Gradual
          friction braking would be useful in extremely high axial shock
          or acceleration situations. Gradual braking can minimize the
          loading on the side walls, rollers, and end caps after an
          extremely high kinetic energy level has been attained by the

          Single-stage speed changes have been successfully demonstrated
          in which step-up and step-down rations as high as 300 to 1
          were used.</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><i>Types of Motion:</i>
          Cycloidal types of motion which are available provide
          excellent sources of contacting, cutting, counterbalancing,
          and instrument indicator actions and can approximate almost
          every type of planar curve. Certain portions of the
          trajectories exhibit extremely high mechanical advantages as
          well. The roller counter-rotation can provide ideal action for
          fusing, aligning, valving, etc., or can be employed to permit
          either response to or rejection of angular acceleration inputs
          (See Figure 29).</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><b>Figure 29:</b> Types of
          Motion such as cycloidal and trochoidal are available by
          attaching parts to the rollers. Path 1 is on the surface of
          the roller. Paths 2, 3, and 4 show the effect of an increasing
          radius and illustrate the motions of points on a flywheel, for
          instance.</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Counter-rotation can also be
          used to provide counter-balancing with respect to all inertial
          inputs. Because cluster motion in either direction provides
          both clockwise and counterclockwise motions, the designer has
          additional flexibility in solving his problems. The
          inertia-to-mass ratio can be regulated by roller design to
          produce cluster behavior approaching that of a point-mass on
          the one extreme, or can be maximized by employing rollers with
          flywheel proportions to provide long-range inertial odometer
          behavior.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><i>Pumping Fluids:</i> The
          conventional cluster becomes a very effective frictionless
          piston if a rectangular tube with a small side clearance is
          used to house and provide guidance surfaces for the cluster.
          The band tension provides normal forces which neatly seal the
          rollers at the three contact zones of Figure 10, A, B, and C.
          Side-guidance surfaces in the channel prevent tip leakage in
          two of the three short leakage path areas and permit the
          device to work in any orientation without appreciable wear or
          friction.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">By using a collapsible tube
          in conjunction with the band, as shown in Figure 30, a much
          smaller displacement of fluid per inch of cluster stroke may
          be obtained.</font> </p>

          applied to the loose end moving it to the right. The spring
          provides the return force. In an actual pump, of course, check
          valves would be needed. Any desired fluid displacement per

          temperature changes induced environmentally, internally by
          dissipation of electrical energy, etc. The low rolling
          friction of the cluster permits high band tensions to be used
          without introducing appreciable friction, so that the output
          force or energy from a bimetalically driven device can be
          sizable. Tow useful methods of accomplishing thermally induced

          Many of the means for locally amplifying forces while also
          permitting some relative sliding are suitable for electrical
          contacts. The combination of high force and sliding action
          insures that the contact surfaces penetrate through and scrub

          high-contact pressures help insure low ohmic contacting.
          Figure 35 shows one arrangement for achieving this action.
          With the cutout roller contact of Figure 36, the roller
          centerline need not lift up to achieve contact engagement.
          Once the unbacked portion of the band begins to touch the
          contact block and is deflected inward, differential sliding
          occurs since the contact point is no longer at the rolling

          neutral contact (one which will stay closed but which will
          open very easily), and one give a latching contact (one which

      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Part 4: Hardware</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><i>Bands:</i> Bands for use
          in rolamite geometries may be made of any material which is
          strong under tensile loading and flexible enough to undergo
          the required number of cluster movement cycles (Figure 38).
          Usually this also means that the flexing cycle should not
          permit plastic behavior unless such behavior is to damp out
          oscillations. In any situation, however, the active regions of
          the bands will necessarily be thin relative to the roller
          diameters with the ratio of t/d &lt; 0.020 in most cases.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">If the flexural and tensile
          properties only are important, the best performance will be
          given by band materials which yield the highest ratios of
          yield stress divided by the tensile modulus of elasticity. For
          a given thickness of band, such materials would insure the
          lowest maximum stress; or if maximum tensile strength is
          needed, they would permit using the strongest band without
          obtaining plastic behavior.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Maximizing this ratio does
          not necessarily minimize the frictional losses displayed by
          the rolamite cluster. Flexural hysteresis losses can be
          minimized by using a material which exhibits minimal internal
          damping while displaying a high ratio of yield stress divided
          by the tensile modulus of elasticity. And then selecting
          roller diameters, shapes, widths, etc., which permit
          minimizing the ratio of t/w where w is the band width.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Rolling friction losses can
          be minimized by employing high modulus materials for the
          rollers, guides and bands, by using the best available surface
          finishes, by reducing the coefficient of sliding friction
          between the rollers and guide surfaces and the band, by using
          dry lubricants, surface coatings, oxides, etc., and by using
          the lowest band tension consistent with performance
          requirements. To date, all of Sandia's rolamite devices use
          metal bands or plastic-metal composite bands where insulated
          electrical conductors must be provided within the active
          portion of the band but several devices with plastic bands of
          Mylar, Kapton, and Teflon-impregnated woven fiberglass have
          operated satisfactorily.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Not only must the band
          material be carefully selected but also the exact condition of
          the material must be controlled if a consistent repetition of
          behavior of subsequent units is to be achieved. Sandia has
          found that several of the age-hardening spring metals in their
          fully cold-worked and age-hardened state best fill the present
          rolamite component needs by offering high yield strengths
          while retaining enough elongation to eliminate a critical
          crack propagation situation. Spring metals used include such
          alloys as beryllium copper 25 and 17-7 PH stainless steel.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The bands may be shaped by
          standard processes such as machining or chemical etching, or
          controlled electroforming.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In general, those methods
          which do not raise burrs or cause thickness variations are
          preferable even if the width definition is not highly refined.
          In the axial force equation the thickness terms appears raised
          to the third power while only the first power of width
          applies. Therefore, whether axial forces are to be generated
          intentionally or not, variation in the band EI (where I is the
          cross-section area moment of inertia for the band) introduced
          by the band material fabrication process will result in axial
          force variations.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In addition to the
          variations which are useful in or near the working portion
          (that portion which is actually permitted to flex as the
          cluster moves between its two limiting positions), several
          other types of features become useful only in regions of the
          band well removed from the working portion. These features may
          provide structural attachment, positioning, electrical
          circuitry, electrical circuit termination, electrical
          contacts, electrical connector pins or sockets, electrical
          cabling, electrical connectors, mechanical fastening,
          auxiliary side bands, commutating contacts, potentiometer
          resistive elements, and lateral compliance. Having these
          features provided by the band can insure fabrication and
          assembly advantages over separate piece-parts.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The structural portion of
          the band can be made of material of any required thickness and
          joined to the thin active layer or layers by means such as
          spot welding or silver soldering, which would leave metal
          interfaces conductive, or through use of insulating adhesives
          and additional plastic films if desired. By having these
          additional layers provided only where they are needed, many
          additional processing steps are eliminated and a minimum
          amount of material wastage occurs.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">By adding these layers as
          continuous strips to a full-width backing layer, special
          flexible strip laminates are obtained, permitting the band
          patterns to be arrayed transversely very closely spaced. Thus,
          a very efficient manufacturing process becomes possible for
          the automated production of highly sophisticated rolamite
          bands which are capable of replacing a great umber of
          individual parts.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><i>Rollers:</i> Although not
          quite as subject to variations as the bands, the rolamite
          rollers may have several different configurations other than
          the simple straight right circular cylinders shown thus far.
          Such changes would allow the ratio of inertia to linear
          inertia to be varied, for example.</font> </p>

          are used in detenting and in changing the cluster repose
          angle. Divergence in the support can provide gradual changes
          in cluster tension, axial force, etc. Undulations allow soft

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><b>Abstract -- </b>A
          roller-band device which substantially eliminates or minimizes
          sliding friction; the device having a plurality of rotatable
          members in a guideway with generally equidistantly spaced
          walls, with each wall supporting and restraining one of the
          rotatable members and separated from each other less than the
          summation of the diameters of the rotatable members, and a
          flexible band between the guideway walls having a portion
          disposed between the rotatable members at leas partially
          encompassing at least one member, the band holding the members
          with generally parallel axes and providing rolling motion
          between each element of the device.</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Background of the
            Invention</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In prior electro-mechanical
          and mechanical devices which transferred one form of motion or
          energy into another such as bearings, gear systems, condition
          sensitive switches, etc., the accuracy, efficiency, and
          sensitivity as well as the life of the devices have been
          limited by the degree or amount of sliding friction inherent
          in the device or sliding friction resulting from structural
          inaccuracies in the elements used in the device. In attempting
          to compensate or minimize sliding friction losses, compromises
          in construction are sometimes made which contribute further
          limiting factors in efficiency and sensitivity of the device
          under some operating conditions.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Attempts to minimize
          friction often resort to lubrication of the moving parts with
          various liquid, gaseous or solid lubricants. These lubricants
          may create forces which are detrimental to the operation of
          certain devices under highly sensitive operating conditions.
          The lubricant may contaminate critical areas within the
          housing or a portion thereof and require packing or sealing
          materials to prevent contamination and thus create other
          friction losses. Further, under extreme operating conditions
          such as high and low temperatures and prolonged storage,
          lubricants may not perform in the desired manner and may
          effect either partial or complete device failure.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The efficiency of land
          bearing surfaces has always been limited by the ability to
          fabricate precision surfaces or dimensions. For instance, in
          bearings such as roller-bearings, misalignment of rollers
          results in end frictional losses and attempts to provide
          closer alignment with caging frequently results in additional
          frictional loses therebetween. If the losses in adjacent
          roller ends can be minimized, surface roughness on the rollers
          may cause additional losses which may substantially exceed any
          attainable rolling coefficient of friction, thus placing a
          lower limit on overall efficiency.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In devices such as
          accelerometers or G-switches, attempts to increase the
          accelerometer's sensitivity by decreasing sliding friction
          between the various elements of the device may also decrease
          the force applied between the electrical contacts closed by
          the devices reactions an acceleration force since this force
          is generally dependent upon opposing sliding members. Further,
          such devices generally may not be adjusted to respond
          accurately to a relatively wide range of acceleration force
          due to unpredictable and variable frictional losses between
          the device's members.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Prior electrical
          potentiometers are also dependent and limited y sliding
          frictional forces between the contacts or contacts and
          resistance material. Any attempt to decrease the sliding
          frictional force to increase component life or sensitivity may
          result in a decrease in resistance linearity.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The problem became
          particularly acute in modern microminiaturized technology
          since the adverse effects of any friction may be greatly
          amplified relative to the size and forces available to
          activate the device. It has been shown that the friction force
          approaches a constant level for normal loading under about 10
          grams, which makes it hard to achieve a reasonable driving
          force to friction ratios in microminiature devices. Further,
          it is difficult to fabricate these devices so that they can
          perform multiple functions or provide a complex response to a
          predetermined or desired situation, environment or event. For
          instance, it may be desirable that a G-switch have one or more
          open or closed electrical contacts in its quiescent state, be
          accurately adjustable over a given range of acceleration
          force, be capable of sensing whether the acceleration force
          continued for at least a given period (and if not have
          automatic reset capabilities), be stable over long periods of
          time and over wide ranges of operating conditions, have one or
          ore open or closed electrical contacts in its activated state,
          provide latching in its activated state, and be relatively
          sensitive to load components not on the sensitive axis.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It is desirable in this area
          of technology that a mechanism or apparatus be capable of
          modular construction, e.g., that the mechanism be constructed
          of standardized parts that can be assembled to perform a wide
          range of functions depending of the particular parts used and
          the environment in which the device is used. Using a given
          module, a wide range of devices can be fabricated using mass
          production techniques to perform a wide range of functions
          without providing separate tooling and production facilities
          for each device. Such modular construction can provide
          commensurate per unit tie and cost savings while permitting
          the facility to be converted in a minimum of time to the
          production of another modular device performing an entirely
          different function.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Sliding friction may be
          decreased by further precision fabrication, closer tolerances
          and the use of such sophisticated techniques such as air
          bearings. However, there is generally both a financial and a
          technology limit to these approaches and the devices become
          increasingly sensitive to environmental conditions such as
          temperature, moisture and surface contaminations such as with
          dirt or dust.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Since rolling coefficients
          of friction are considerably lower than sliding coefficients
          of friction, it is desirable to provide electro-mechanical or
          mechanical devices having only rolling friction losses.
          Rolling coefficients of friction have been measured as low as
          about 0.00001 to 0.00002 for right circular cylinders whereas
          roller bearings and ball bearings have attained coefficients
          of friction of only about 0.001 to 0.005 due to the loss
          mechanism noted above and several others which have not been
          mentioned.</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">By way of introduction, the
          mechanism shown in Figure 1, which may be referred to as a
          "roller-band" device, illustrates various features and
          principles of this invention. As shown, roller-band device 10
          includes a group or pair of adjacent rotatable members or
          rollers 12 and 14 supported between equidistantly spaced
          restraining surfaces or walls 16 and 18 of a guideway by a
          flexible, tensioned band or ribbon 20. Band 20 extends in
          generally S-shaped configuration partially around members 12
          and 14 and may be held under tension by suitable fasteners 22
          and 24, such as screws or bolts, which attach band ends at
          opposite extremities of the guideway on opposing walls. The
          guideway walls 16 and 18 are supported at either end by end
          blocks or walls 26 and 28. The summation of the diameters of
          the rotatable members is at least slightly greater than the
          distance between walls 16 and 18 of the guideway.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In the embodiment
          illustrated in Figure 1, rotatable members 12 and 14 may be
          right circular cylinders of any convenient length. Tension
          band 20 in this embodiment may be a flat elongated band of any
          convenient constant width and any convenient thickness. For
          purposes of illustration, tension band 20 is shown with
          exaggerated thickness since generally it may be from about
          0.0002 to 0.004 inch thick for instrumentation usage. The
          guideway, which includes walls 16 and 18, may also include
          side walls (not shown) depending on the application of the
          invention.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As shown rotatable members
          12 and 14 are in an initial position with member 14 and the
          corresponding contiguous portion of tension band 20 in latch
          or detent 30 in wall 18. If a predetermined force function is
          applied in the direction of the arrow (for example by
          acceleration of the device toward the left) which is
          sufficient to overcome the forces of tension band 20, inertia
          of members 12 and 14 and band 20, the coefficient of friction
          (e.g., rolling friction), and the band tension holding roller
          14 in detent 30, member 14 may be released from the detent. If
          this force function or some lesser force (now only dependent
          on the band tension friction and inertial forces) continues,
          members 12 and 14 may continue to roll along the guideway
          until the force function is discontinued or members 12 and 14
          may continue to roll along the guideway until the force
          function is discontinued or member 14 reaches energy barrier
          32. If sufficient force is applied over the travel of the
          rollers to raise the kinetic energy above some threshold
          provided by the combination of height and width of the barrier
          and the increased tension placed n tension band 20, the
          members may roll over barrier 32 and drop into latch or detent
          34 as shown by the dashed representation of the rotatable
          members and tension band. In order to unlock the roller-band
          device in a reverse direction, a force would have to be
          applied in the opposite direction to overcome both detent 34
          and barrier 32.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Roller-band device 10 may
          operate a switch contact or microswitch 35 or be provided with
          electrical contacts on the ends of either member 12 or 14 and
          on the appropriate wall of the guideway, or tension band 20
          can be used as an electrical contact and another contact
          provided within detent 34 in wall 18 so that an electrical
          circuit is completed when member 14 reaches detent 34. thus,
          the roller-band device shown in Figure 1 may be used to
          measure or sense a force or combination of forces and the
          integration of the forces over a given time determined by the
          length of the guideway. Such devices can be released from
          detent 30 and rolled over barrier 32 with an accuracy of plus
          or minus a fraction of a percent of predetermined force
          levels.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">With the general
          construction and operation of the Figure 1 type of device in
          mind, reference will now be made to the simplified roller-band
          device of Figure 2 in order to explain more of the principles
          of the device. As in Figure 1, roller-band device 42 includes
          a group or pair of adjacent rotatable members 44 and 46
          supported between equidistantly spaced walls 48 and 50 of a
          guideway by a flexible tension band 52. Rotatable members 44
          and 46 are shown in an initial position adjacent end wall 47,
          with the band 52 shown departing from contact with walls 48
          and 50 at contact "lines" or lines of tangency 54 and 56.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As the band 52 is looped or
          threaded around members 44 and 46 and fastened under tension
          by suitable means to diagonally opposite ends of walls 48 and
          50 of the guideway, the band tension produces a torque which
          urges the rotatable members firmly toward their respective
          restraining walls 48 and 50 and holds their axes parallel to
          each other, the combined effect of band tension and
          restraining walls being to urge the rollers firmly toward each
          other. With the rollers in the noted initial relationship, the
          position of the contact lines or zones may be varied to an
          extent by changing the tension of the band.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">By way of explanation, it
          appears that the force (F) to effect movement of the rotatable
          members contributed by any one of the three rolling contact
          zones (at contact lines 54 and 56 and between rollers 44 and
          46) is equal to the coefficient of rolling friction (mu, <i>u</i>)
          times the applied normal force (N) at that zone induced by the
          tension band and inertial forces. At any one zone:</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(1) F = <i>u</i>N</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">so for the entire geometry,
          the total frictional force (F<sub>t</sub>):</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">F<sub>t</sub> = <i>u</i><sub>1</sub>N<sub>1</sub>
          + <i>u</i><sub>2</sub>N<sub>2</sub> + <i>u</i><sub>3</sub>N<sub>3</sub></font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The normal force (N) results
          from the tension applied to the band and the inertial forces
          of the system. Since the inertial forces of the rotatable
          members and band and the coefficient of friction are
          relatively small, the tension applied to the band may be the
          primary variable used to control or predict (F).</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Since the tension band 52 is
          shown bent around a portion of each member 44 and 46 in
          opposite directions, energy stored elastically in the S-shaped
          part of the band applies opposite resultant forces which
          emanate from the axes of each rotatable member, likewise the
          axial components of these forces Fb in opposition in the
          direction of each band parallel to the guideway walls at each
          contact line or zone is defined by the following formula where
          force is measured at the center of one or the other where:</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(3) F<sub>b</sub> = WE<i>h</i><sup>3</sup>
          / 12R<sup>2</sup></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">where</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">W = width of band at line
          contact,</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">E = modulus of elasticity of
          band at line contact,</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">R = radius of rotatable
          member, and</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times"><i>h</i> = thickness of band
          at line contact.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">If the band parameters W, E
          and <i>h</i> are equal at both zone or lie contacts 54 and 56
          and the radius of the members are equal, the opposing forces
          (Fb) will be equal and the roller-band device will be in a
          state of equilibrium or rest in the absence of any external
          forces. The direction and magnitude of these forces are
          essentially independent of the band tension. Because one or
          more of the parameters of the band may be different at line
          contacts 54 and 56 (defined as positions 1 and 2
          respectively):</font> </p>

          F<sub>b2</sub></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">resulting in an unbalanced
          force (F<sub>r</sub>) being applied to the rotatable members.
          If for instance force F<sub>b2</sub> is larger than the force
          F<sub>b1</sub>, the force bias (F<sub>r</sub>) will be applied
          to the rotatable members in the direction of the arrow. If the
          width (W) of the band is varied, the formula for the
          unbalanced forces becomes:</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(5) F<sub>1</sub> = (W<sub>1</sub>
          - W<sub>2</sub>) Eh<sup>3</sup> / 12R<sup>2</sup></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The other variables, E, h
          and R, may be varied to apply a force bias to the rotatable
          members.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Axial forces may be
          introduced by employing a band with preset loops or curves.
          These loops or curves may be formed by conventional tempering
          or cold forming processes. Forces may also be introduced by
          varying the material longitudinally in the band by laminating
          or connecting together various materials along the band by
          conventional processes.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Figures 3a to 3<i>l</i>
          illustrate various tension band configurations which provide
          various band width combinations at the line contacts with the
          guideway walls showing the resulting force bias (Fr) applied
          to the tension band and consequently the rotatable members.
          The tension band configurations in Figures 3a to 3l will be
          applied to the roller-band device 42 shown in Figure 2. IT
          will be assumed, for purposes of illustration, that the
          vertical axis of the force diagram in each of the drawings
          crosses tension band 52 at contact line 56 adjacent member 46
          and that a portion of band 52 which partially encompasses
          member 44 is contiguous with the end wall of roller-band
          device 42.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In Figure 3a, tension band
          52a has a uniform width throughout this length. Since the
          width of the band at line contacts 54 and 56 are equal, the
          resulting force (Fr) is zero as shown in the force diagram.
          This is the same configuration described with reference to
          Figure 1.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In Figure 3b, tension band
          52b has a rectangular cutout 60b which begins to the left of
          line contact 56 in Figure 2 and continues around rotatable
          members 46 and 44, stopping just short of line contact 54. The
          distance of contact this represents is also the maximum travel
          the geometry can undergo without passing out of the force
          zone. Using Equation 5 above, cutout 60b generates a constant
          resulting force (Fr) in the opposite direction of the arrow in
          Figure 2 (a positive force) for the time in which the cutout
          60b is adjacent the line contact 56. Using tension band 52b
          with the roller-band device 42 of Figure 2, the roller-band
          device may be used to measure forces, such as acceleration
          forces, in the direction of the arrow and the period of the
          force. If a negative force which is greater than the force of
          the band cutout is applied to the roller band device, the
          members and band may rotate may rotate along the guideway for
          the duration of the force. If the force continues for a time
          sufficient to allow the members to move to a second position
          having line contacts 62 and 64 as shown by the dashed lines in
          Figure 2 which are beyond the cutout, the resulting force bias
          on the tension band will be zero and the tension band will be
          in a state of equilibrium. If the force does not continue for
          a sufficient time to allow the members and tension band to
          reach line contacts 62 and 64, the force bias will cause the
          members and tension band to return to its initial position
          against the end wall.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Roller-band device 42 with
          tension band 52b may also be used as a condition sensing
          switch by positioning the rotatable members and band to the
          right of line contact 56 with cutout 60b still adjacent to the
          line cutout and physically holding the member in that position
          by a condition sensing means such as a fusible material or a
          releasable magnetic latch (not shown). Should the desired
          condition occur, the conditioning means may release the
          members and allow them to return under the tension band force
          bias to the end wall of the device and thus energize a switch
          (not shown). Such a device may be used, for example, as a
          circuit breaker or a circuit fault sensor.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In Figure 3c, tension band
          52c is tapered at a uniform rate throughout the entire length
          of the tension band. Since the difference in width of the
          tension band at the line contacts for each rotatable member
          will be the same along the entire length of the guideway, the
          resulting force (Fr) is constant. The tapered band force is
          not limited by the length of the contact of the band with the
          rollers as in cutout 60b in Figure 3b. Using mechanical
          latching such as that shown in Figure 1 and the concepts
          described with reference to Figure 3b roller-band device 42,
          having tension band 52c, may perform the same functions as
          band 52b.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It will be apparent that
          tension band 52c may have a uniform width and a uniformly
          tapered cutout throughout its length to provide the same force
          bias.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In Figure 3d, tension band
          52d includes a complex cutout 60d, a portion of which may be
          adjacent line contact 56 in configuration shown in Figure 2,
          and a second cutout 58d, which may be adjacent line contact 62
          and member 44 as shown by the dashed lines in Figure 2. Cutout
          60d provides a similar positive force bias as cutout 60b in
          Figure 3b except that the force bias has three force levels
          with step changes between each level. Cutout 58d provides a
          negative force bias which may function as a latch similar to
          mechanical detents or latches 30 and 34 in Figure 1. The step
          function force bias generated by cutout 60d may perform the
          same function as mechanical detent 30 in Figure 1.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In Figure 3e, tension band
          52e includes a pair of triangular cutouts 58e and 60e. The
          base of triangular cutout 58e may be adjacent line contact 54
          at one end of the force bias while the base of triangular
          cutout 60e may be adjacent line contact 64. the combined force
          bias generates a curve similar to a positive spring constant
          having a stable position where the force bias crosses the
          force diagram axis, e.g., where the apexes of the triangular
          cutouts are both simultaneously adjacent to a line contact
          about midway between line contacts 54 and 62 and 56 and 64
          respectively. A roller-band device using tension band 52e may
          be used, for example, as a shock absorber or vibration damper.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In Figure 3f, tension band
          52f includes a triangular cutout 60f having its apex adjacent
          to line contact 56. The resulting force bias, like Figure 3e s
          similar to a positive spring constant exhibited by a helical
          spring.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In Figure 3g, the generally
          concave tapered band width configuration shown produces a
          parabolic shaped force bias, thus providing both a positive
          and negative spring constant type force curve.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In Figures 3h, 3i and 3j,
          various cutouts and band width changes in tension bands 52h,
          52i and 52j generate force biases which are similar to a
          negative spring constant force pattern. These cutouts and
          width changes operate on roller-band device 42 in the same
          manner as shown in Figures 3e, 3f and 3g and described above.
          By positioning the line contact of either tension band 52h,
          52i or 52j adjacent rotatable member 46 along the force bias
          curve, a wide range of forces can be measured by roller-band
          device 42 using a single tension band geometry.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Figure 3k illustrates an
          arbitrary force bias which may be generated by a tension band
          such as band 52k merely by selecting the force bias desired
          and then design an appropriate cutout or cutouts.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In Figure 3<i>l</i>, the two
          series of circular cutouts in tension band 52<i>l</i> generate
          a generally sinusoidal force bias. Such a force bias may be
          used to provide multiple stable or detent positions for
          rotatable members 44 and 46.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">By choosing one or more of
          the cutout or band width configurations illustrated in Figures
          3a to 3<i>l</i> or variations and combinations thereof, any
          desired force bias may be generated with roller-band device
          42. There are some applications where it may be desirable to
          use a primary force biased or non-biased tension band and
          rotatable member pair in conjunction with one or more
          secondary tension bands with or without their own rotatable
          members having separate force biasing to obtain a desired
          composite force biasing. The additional secondary tension
          bands may act as a pusher or damping on the primary tension
          band. Another typical force bias will be illustrated in Figure
          8 which may be used in particular applications of the
          principles of this invention. For most applications it is
          preferable to provide the desired force biasing with cutouts
          rather than vary the outside dimension of the tension band
          since the cutouts can be formed more precisely with
          conventional techniques such as photographic etching
          processes.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The tension band may be of a
          wide range of flexible materials or combination thereof
          depending on the particular application of the roller-band
          device such as plastics, metals, alloys, laminates,
          insulators, viscoelastic materials, etc. Typical materials
          include aluminum, stainless steel, beryllium-copper-plastic
          laminates, polyethylene terepthalate (sold under the trademark
          "Mylar") and polyimides (sold under the trademark "Kapton").
          In some applications it may be desirable to use a temperature
          sensitive bimetallic tension band which will generate or
          modify force biasing in response to temperature variations.</font>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Figures 4a and 4b illustrate
          a tension band having multiple electrical conductors embedded
          therein. Tension band 34 includes a main body or portion 36
          which may be made of a suitable solid or laminated material. A
          pair of aligned conductors 38 and 40 and conductor 41 may be
          embedded in or laminated between the insulating material of
          portion 36. Any number of conductors, having a desired length,
          may be embedded within a tension band such as band 34
          depending on the required electrical circuits or connections
          determined by the particular application of the device (See
          the description of tension band 172 in Figure 10). If it is
          desired to make contact with either of conductors 38,40 or 41
          through the tension band walls, the insulating material of
          portion 36 may be removed or separate contacts fastened to the
          tension band at the point of desired contact.</font> </p>

          right circular cylindrical, rotatable members may be sued (see
          Figures 1, 10 and 13) since they provide a continuous rotating
          movement. The rollers may also be made with one or more spring
          biased members which may be urged outwardly against the side
          walls of the guideway to eliminate the need to precisely
          control roller lengths as is needed in some cases. Also, in
          some application desired force patterns, detenting, latching,
          etc., may be obtained by using alternate or complex rotating
          member shapes. The rotatable members may also be formed in a

          guideway walls 72. Rotatable member 66 is generally a right
          circular cylinder having a flat portion 74. Rotatable members
          68 have generally equilateral triangular polyhedron shapes
          while the members 70 have generally triangular polyhedron
          shapes with one curved portion 75. As member 66 rotates with
          its band onto a flat portion of the member, such as portion
          74, the roller-band device assumes a generally stable position
          representing slightly decreased band tension and may function
          as a detent or latch until a sufficient force in either
          direction can rotate the member off the flat portion. Various
          combinations of detents and latches may be incorporated in the
          device with this technique. As can be seen in Figure 5, flat
          portion 74 may provide additional compliance in the device
          depending on the band tension to remove the criticality in the
          tension setting procedure or provide shock absorbing ability.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A block 78 may be positioned
          on the inner wall surface of guideway wall 72 so that a
          rotatable member and tension band can be rotated over the
          same.&nbsp; As the rotatable member, such as member 66,
          rotates over block 78 the normal force (N) introduced by band
          tension, may be essentially recovered. If the block is
          actually two or more contact points the normal force may be
          shared equally among the contact points because of the
          compliance provided by the flat portion 74. The small amount
          of slipping induced by the slight reduction in radius at the
          flat portion serves to remove oxide films or contaminants and
          assure clean contacting. In flat portion 74 is positioned
          adjacent block 76, additional wiping may be provided between
          the contacts as well as a greater detenting or latching force
          or a repulsive force created depending on the relative
          positions of portion 74, block 76 and the center of member 66.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Where extreme sensitivity is
          required, complimentary spool-shaped rotatable members 77 and
          78 may be used as shown in Figure 5d. Members 77 and 78 are
          shaped so that the members do not have surfaces contacting
          opposing surfaces of tension band 79. The configuration shown
          tends to reduce or substantially eliminate the detrimental
          effects of any surface roughness on members 77 and 78. Surface
          roughness effects may also be substantially eliminated by
          either increasing the band tension to cause plastic
          deformation of the members and smooth out surface roughness or
          decreasing band tension so that the members ride on the peaks
          of surface roughness. Spool-shaped member 78 may also be used
          where it is desired to decrease the mass of the roller-band
          device and the resulting inertial forces.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The rotatable members may be
          made of a wide range of materials with or without coatings
          depending on the application of the roller-band device and any
          force bias contribution desired from the member. Typical
          materials which may be used are metals such as beryllium,
          aluminum, stainless steel, brass, beryllium-copper alloy and
          tungsten carbide or insulating materials such as alumina,
          structural plastics, and rubber.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The guideway or housing
          supporting or restraining walls may be made of any suitable
          material depending on the application of the roller-band
          device such as conventional insulating materials and metals or
          alloys. Where the tension band is used as an electrical
          conductor, the guideway may be coated with a layer of
          insulating material. The guideway tension band supporting
          walls can be provided with various detenting, latching, sears
          and electrical contacts as shown in Figures 1 and 5 to perform
          a wide range of functions with respect to the tension band and
          rotatable members. The guideway side walls may be provided
          with grooves or orifices to provide fluid damping in an
          enclosed roller-band device between opposite sides of the
          tension band and rotatable members. Further, the guideway side
          walls may be provided with sears, wedges, electrical contacts,
          magnetic actuated pin latches, etc., depending on the
          particular applications of the roller-band device.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">While roller supporting
          walls are shown in the drawings as generally equidistantly
          spaced from each other, either as flat parallel members or as
          flat arcuate members, they may be of diverging or converging
          relationship with respect to each other, so long as the
          distance between them is at their effective operative portions
          not greater than the sum of the effective diameters of the
          rollers. In some specific application requiring special or
          complex force bias functions, the guideway supporting walls
          may be defined as the surfaces generated by passing two
          parallel lines of equal length along two planar
          non-intersecting lines wherein said parallel lines are
          perpendicular to said plane.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The end walls may also
          included various latching and detenting mechanisms as well as
          adjusting screws for positioning or releasing the tension band
          and rotatable members in or from a force bias. The end walls
          may be made of any suitable material depending on the
          application of the roller-band device and function as
          performed by the end wall.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Various modifications, forms
          and combinations of rotatable members, tension bands, and
          guideways and their associated mechanisms will be described
          hereinafter in connection with the following embodiments of
          the roller-band device.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Figures 6 and 7 illustrate
          the present invention in one form of a G-switch or
          accelerometer. A pair of adjacent rotatable members 80 and 82
          are shown held under tension in an initial position between
          guideway supporting walls 84 and 86, sidewalls 88 and 90 and
          end walls 92 and 94 by tension band 96. Tension band 96 may be
          held under tension by suitable fastening means such as screw
          98.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Tension band 96 includes a
          complex cutout 100 and a rectangular cutout 101. Cutout 100 is
          positioned as shown along the contact line of member 80 and
          tension band 96 with wall 84. Cutout 101 is positioned so that
          when member 80 and the band rotate past cutout 100, cutout 101
          will be adjacent the contact line between member 82 and
          tension band 96 and wall 86 in the device's final position.
          Tension band 96 also includes a pair of oppositely facing
          U-shaped cutouts 102 and 104 leaving a pair of tongue-like
          extensions 106 and 108 intermediate the sides of the tension
          band 96. Tongues 106 and 108 extend away from members 80 and
          82 due to the curvature of tension band 96 as shown in Figure
          6.&nbsp; Tongue 108, in the initial position of the
          roller-band G-switch, rests against the end of adjusting screw
          110 which is threaded through end wall 92. The position of
          members 80 and 82 in the guideway may be adjusted by screw 110
          so as to position the contact line of member 80 and tension
          band 96 along the desired portion of the triangular portion or
          negative spring constant of cutout 100.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Tongue 106 is positioned on
          tension band 96 so that the tongue contacts the flat contact
          112 when the roller-band device is in its final position in
          the same manner as block 78 in Figure 5. Electrical leads are
          connected as shown to screw 98, screw 110 and contact 112 to
          provide an initial closed circuit between screw 98 and screw
          110 and an initial open circuit between screw 98 and contact
          112. It will be apparent that walls 84 and 86 may be either
          made of or coated with an insulating material (not shown). In
          the roller-band device's final position, there will be a
          closed circuit between screw 98 and contact 112.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In Figure 8, the resulting
          force bias created by cutouts 100 and 101 and tongue 106 is
          shown by the solid line 114. The force bias generated by
          cutout 100 includes dotted line 116 and the negative spring
          constant portion of line 114 as well as the constant positive
          return force portion of line 114. Cutout 101 generates the
          negative force bias or latching force portion of line 114
          designated by 118. Tongue 108 generates a pushing force
          against the rotatable members, shown by dotted line 120 so as
          to insure a clean breakaway from the initial position after
          long term storage. This compliant stop forces the rollers to
          roll forward a small amount from the initial position to reach
          the breakaway force level. The negative spring constant
          ensures a snap action release.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When the roller-band switch
          is accelerated in the direction of the arrow a force or
          "set-back" is experienced in the opposite direction. If the
          force is sufficient to overcome the rolling friction force (Ft
          from Equation 2) the rotatable members and tension band may
          begin to roll from their initial position determined by screw
          110 and compliant tongue 108. If the force continues and is
          greater than the force bias generated by cutout 100, the
          rotatable members and tension band may continue to roll down
          the guideway. If the force is maintained for a time exceeding
          the time necessary for the rotatable members and tension band
          to traverse the guideway so that the contact line between
          member 82 and wall 86 is over cutout 101, the roller-band
          switch may be locked in position with tongue 106 in contact
          with electrical contact 112. If the force is not maintained
          for the necessary time, the force bias generated by cutout 100
          may reset the roller-band device to its initial position.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A roller-band device has
          inherent directional sensitivity along the longitudinal axis
          of the guideway. The deice is relatively insensitive to
          extraneous side loads or forces because of the counteracting
          balanced forces between the tension band and rotatable members
          in the direction of the normal forces (N) so that for side
          components of force perpendicular to the roller axes but less
          than the total resultant normal force on both surfaces
          constant and only small changes in mu associated with the
          nonlinearity of mu versus load are experienced. This normal
          force creates friction between the members, tension band and
          guideway which acts to prevent such force components parallel
          to the roller axes from displacing the rollers laterally which
          is also aided by the band's side stiffness. Lateral motion may
          be substantially eliminated by positioning blocks or guides
          122 (Figure 7) along the periphery of members 80 and 82 on
          sidewalls 88 and 90. Since the guides 122 are along the
          periphery of members 80 and 82 at the position of lowest
          relative velocity between each member and the guides, the
          sliding friction introduced may be kept minimal.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">If rollers with equal mass
          moments of inertia are used they will not respond to
          rotational acceleration components about the roller axes. It
          will be apparent that the switch may be modified to be
          sensitive to rotational acceleration components about the
          roller axes by using rotatable members having different
          inertias.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Figure 9 illustrates a
          roller-band switch or accelerometer which has been modified to
          measure both a G-level and velocity change. The roller-band
          device includes a first pair of adjacent rotatable members 124
          and 126 held under tension in an initial position as shown
          between guideway supporting walls 128 and 130 and end walls
          132 and 134 by a first tension band 136. Member 126 may be
          provided with an orifice 138 passing through the center
          thereof and aligned with an opening 140 in band 136. The
          roller-band device also includes a second pair of adjacent
          rotatable members 142 and 144 held under tension as shown
          adjacent to member 16 by a second tension band 146. Tension
          bands 136 and 146 may be fastened under tension in an
          overlapping manner as shown by suitable fastening means at the
          extremities of each band.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Tension band 146 may be
          provided with suitable force biasing such as that shown in
          Figure 8 with cuto0ut 100 and tongue cutout 102, leaving
          tongue 106, in the same manner as tension band 96 in Figure 8.
          Members 142 and 144 operate in the same manner as members 80
          and 82 in the switch shown in Figures 6 and 7, responding to
          forces in the direction of the arrow. The force level at which
          the members respond may be selected by means of adjustment
          screw 148. The force biasing in tension band 146 holds both
          sets of rotatable members in the initial position. Tension
          band 136 may have uniform width dimension throughout its
          length similar to tension band 52a in Figure 4a.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The interior 149 of the
          guideway may be filled with a suitable damping fluid, liquid
          or gas. Members 124 and 126 and tension band 136 are
          preferably closely dimensioned to that of the side walls so as
          to limit gas leakage around the end s thereof and the side
          walls shaped to provide guide rail type surfaces to prevent
          excessive side friction while members 142 and 144 and tension
          band 146 are loosely dimensioned to allow substantially
          undamped movement.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When the roller-band device
          is subjected to a predetermined or preselected acceleration to
          the left, members 142 and 144 and tension band 146 may roll to
          the end of the guideway adjacent to end wall 134 with tongue
          106 engaged or locked in ledge or shelf 150 in wall 134.
          Simultaneously, members 124 and 126 and tension band 136 may
          begin to roll in the same direction since there is no force
          biasing holding the rotatable members and tension band in
          their initial position. The rate at which members 124 and 126
          roll along the guideway is dependent on the rate of flow of
          the damping fluid or gas through orifice 138 and opening 140
          thus integrating the acceleration force with respect to time.
          Suitable electrical contacts may be provided on the guideway
          and tension bands to indicate the G-level sensed by the embers
          142 and 144 and tension band 146 and the velocity change
          measured by members 124 and 126 and tension band 136.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The roller-band device may
          reset to its initial position by forcing or pushing tongue 106
          off ledge 150 with screw 152.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Figure 10 illustrates a
          roller-band accelerometer or G-switch which may sense one or
          more G-force levels. The switch shown in Figure 10 includes a
          pair of adjacent, spool-shaped rotatable members 154 and 156
          held under tension between guideway supporting walls 158 and
          160 and end walls 162 and 164 by tension band 166.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Tension band 166 may include
          a rectangular cutout 168 as shown, similar to cutout 60b in
          Figure 3b along a substantial portion of the band leaving a
          pair of outer band portions which supports members 154 and 156
          their respective rim portions 170 and 172. Since the outer
          band portions have equal dimensions at each contact line, the
          tension band does not contribute force biasing to the switch.
          The tension band may be fastened with suitable fastening means
          at diagonally opposing ends of the guideway as discussed
          previously. The band may be fabricated with separate
          longitudinally oriented and insulated conductors (not shown:
          see Figure 4a) along each outer portion by conventional
          laminating techniques and the band folded around the outside
          of end wall 164 to provide two sets of conductors which when
          connected together by the action of the switch may form
          separate complete circuits with a measuring or utilization
          means (not shown) which may be connected to the exposed
          interrupted conductors in a conventional manner. For instance,
          the portion of the tension band folded around end wall 164 may
          be plugged directly into a suitable connector or circuit board
          and thus make contact with the interrupted conductors and
          complete the circuit with measuring means.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Since the roller appear to
          be rolling generally about the contact lines at any given
          point along the guideway, displacement or forces may be
          applied or decreased infinitely in a mechanism by coupling or
          connecting the mechanism to any point on any radius of the
          roller, either above or below the roller axis and either
          within or without the roller diameter, depending on the
          desired result. Thus, a tension spring 178 may be fastened
          between the rims of rotatable member 156, as shown, and end
          wall 162 so as to decrease spring placement and effectively
          lengthen the spring. The spring may be fastened to an
          initially smaller radius of the rotatable member (such as a
          chordal cutout in the outside circumference leaving a
          substantial surface of the original circumference) which
          radius is increased as the rotatable member rolls so as to
          effect increased displacement of the spring at the beginning
          of motion and allow the spring to be stored at relatively low
          tensions. Tension spring 178 preferably has a linear positive
          spring constant. Spring 178 may be fastened to end wall 162
          with suitable adjusting means so as to enable the adjustment
          of the proper spring tension along the force bias curve. An
          adjustable breakaway force level may be provided by adjusting
          screw 180.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As the switch shown in
          Figure 10 is subjected to an increasing force in the direction
          of the arrow which exceeds the preselected breakaway force,
          the rotatable members and tension band may roll along the
          guideway. As the members and band continue to roll, the
          tension spring is stretched, increasing the force bias applied
          to member 156. If the force level does not continue to
          increase, the members and tension band may reach a stable
          balanced position of rest or they may return to the initial
          position. If the force level increases sufficiently, the
          rotatable members and tension band will roll over electrical
          contacts 174 and 176 at preselected force levels and initiate
          the measuring or utilization circuits. The tension spring and
          positions of contacts 174 and 176 may be adjusted and
          calibrated by conventional standard weight techniques.</font>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Figure 11 illustrates a
          roller-band device which may function as a substantially
          frictionless piston in a fluid pump. The roller-band device in
          Figure 11 includes a pair of adjacent rotatable members 182
          and 184 held under tension in an initial position between
          guideway supporting walls 186 and 188, end walls 190 and 192
          and side walls (not shown) by tension band 194. Tension band
          194 preferably has a return force type bias such as shown in
          Figure 3b. In order to provide this force bias, the portions
          196 and 198 of tension band 194 which partially encompass 182
          and 184 may be preformed by cold forming tension band 194 in a
          generally S-shape with portion 196 having a greater radius of
          curvature than protion 198.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The travel of members 182
          and 184 and tension band 194 from one end of the guideway or
          to the other may be sensed by suitable electrical contacts or
          by microswitches 200 and 202 as shown.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">For this embodiment, it is
          preferable that the rotatable members and tension band be
          dimensioned as closely as possible to the inside dimensions of
          the side walls so as to form two chambers 201 and 203 on
          either side thereof and to prevent fluid or gas leakage around
          the ends thereof. Typical spacing may be between 0.0002 and
          0.003 inch. A pressurized driving medium may be coupled to
          chamber 201 through end wall 190 by fluid inlet 204 which may
          be controlled or valved by switches 200 and 202 and valve 205.
          Valve 205 may be any suitable multiposition valve which in one
          position may pass driving fluid (either gas or liquid) into
          chamber 201 and in a second position may close off inlet 204
          and vent chamber 201 to ambient pressure. End wall 192
          includes a pumping fluid or gas outlet includes a pumping
          fluid or gas outlet 206 which may be controlled or valved with
          a suitable pressure release or check valve 208. Wall 188
          includes a pumping fluid or gas inlet 210 which may be
          controlled or valved with a suitable pressure sensitive or
          check valve 212.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Assume that the roller-band
          device in Figure 11 is in its initial position, as shown, that
          valve 212 is open allowing pumping fluid or gas into chamber
          203, that switch 200 is energized which in turn has opened
          valve 205 to driving fluid inlet 204 and that switch 202 is
          deenergized. As the driving fluid enters and fills chamber
          201, rotatable members 182 and 184 and tension band 194 may be
          driven down the guideway, deenergizing switch 200 As the
          members and band travel down the guideway, the pressure in
          chamber 203 is increased, closing pressure sensitive valve 212
          and opening valve 208 allowing the pumping fluid to pass
          through outlet 208. When the members and band reach the end of
          the guideway, switch 202 may be energized, thus opening valve
          205 to ambient pressure allowing the driving fluid or gas to
          escape from chamber 201. Tension band 194 may then drive the
          members and band back to their initial position, lowering the
          gas or fluid pressure in chamber 203, thus closing valve 208
          and opening valve 212. Switch 202 may be turned off and switch
          200 turned on, starting the pump stroke again.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The device shown in Figure
          11 may also be used as a piston in an engine, actuator or
          shock absorber.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Figure 12 illustrate a
          roller-band device having unequal diameter rotatable members.
          The device includes a pair of adjacent rotatable members 214
          and 216 held under tension between guideway supporting walls
          218 and 220 and end walls 222 and 224 by tension band 226.
          Tension band 226 may have any desired force biasing and the
          relative sizes of members 214 and 216 may be selected
          depending on the particular application of the device.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As the rotatable members and
          tension band roll along the guideway, member 214 may turn at a
          greater rate of speed than that of member 216 depending on the
          ration of the diameters of the members. Roller band devices
          have been constructed with speed change ratios as high as 200
          to 1.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A doubly integrating
          accelerometer may be provided by rigidly attaching a pair of
          large diameter flywheels (not shown) to member 214, using the
          inertia of the flywheels as an integrating force so that the
          linear motion of the members and tension band represent the
          motion of a carrying vehicle. This device may also act as a
          rack and pinion wherein one member functions as a rack and the
          other functions as a pinion.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Figure 13 illustrates a
          roller-band device which may function as an electrical
          potentiometer and function generator. The device shown
          includes a pair of hollow rotatable members 226 and 228 held
          under tension between guideway supporting walls 230 and 232
          and end walls 234 and 236 by tension band 238. Tension band
          238 may have any desired force biasing depending on the
          particular application of the potentiometer or function
          generator. Wall 230, in this embodiment includes an outer
          guideway wall 240, a first resistance wire 242 and a second
          resistance wire 244 laterally disposed from resistance wire
          242, and an insulating layer 246 separating the resistance
          wires from wall 240. Tension band 238, which may be made of a
          suitable electrical conductive material, rolls directly along
          resistance wires 242 and 244. Resistance wires 242 and 244 may
          be connected to a suitable power source (not shown) and
          utilization means (not shown).</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As the rotatable members and
          tension band roll along the guideway, tension band 238 acts as
          a moving electrical short at its contact line with the
          resistance wires, thus establishing a varying resistance loop.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">If one or both of the
          resistance wires 242 and 244 is bent or curved with respect to
          the other wire, the linear movement of tension band 238 along
          the resistance wires may generate any arbitrary function of
          resistance with respect to time or other variables linked to
          roller displacement.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It will be apparent that one
          or the other wires 242 or 244 may be a good conductive
          material and that one wire may be placed along each guideway
          supporting wall rather than on the same wall as shown.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Figure 14 illustrates a
          roller band force amplifier or impacting device which is
          capable of producing large normal forces from a given input
          force. The device includes a pair of adjacent rotatable
          members 250 and 252 held under tension in an initial position
          as shown between an upper guideway supporting wall 254 which
          extends the entire length of the device, a first lower
          guideway supporting wall 256 which extends only a portion of
          the length of the device and end walls 258 and 260 by a
          tension band 262. A second lower guideway wall 264, which is
          separated from wall 254 by a greater distance than wall 256,
          extends from the end of wall 256 the remaining length of the
          device to end wall 260. The end portion 257 of wall 256 thus
          provides an abrupt or step increase in guideway supporting
          wall spacing.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Tension band 262 maybe
          fastened at one end to upper wall 254 adjacent end wall 256
          and fastened to tension spring 266. Tension spring 266 may be
          fastened at its free end to a convenient fixed point such as
          the outside of wall 256. Tension spring 266 introduces the
          necessary tension forces to tension band 262. Tension band 262
          may include suitable force biasing, such as described above,
          depending on the application of the device.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The diameters of rotatable
          members 250 and 252 are selected so that their combined
          diameters is at least slightly greater than the distance
          between walls 254 and 264 (the closer the dimension, the
          higher the force amplification). The rotatable members may be
          a solid or hollow cylinder but in order to decrease any
          inertial delays from the "flywheel effect", the members, as
          shown with respect to member 250 may be made of a heavy center
          core 268 concentrically surrounded by a lighter tubular member
          270. Core 268 may be made of a material such as a sintered
          tungsten alloy while member 270 may be made of a material such
          as aluminum.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When the rotatable members
          and tension band are subjected to a force, such as a G-force,
          in the direction of the arrow, the members and band travel
          down the guideway between walls 254 and 256. When a member 252
          reaches end portion 257 and sees the step increase in wall
          spacing, the force in tension band 262 provided by spring
          force in tension spring 266 may be imparted to member 252 as
          kinetic energy. Member 250 is pulled back to the position
          shown by dotted lines and member 242 impacts on wall 264. In
          addition to the very large direct mechanical advantage
          achieved by the spring combination and nearly vertical
          disposition of the rollers at impact, this device also makes
          it possible to recover the very high forces associated with
          the substantially instantaneous stopping of the rollers.
          Substantially all the kinetic energy imparted to the rollers
          is recovered as the rollers impact and are locked in place by
          friction.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A firing pin 272 and
          detonator 274 may be positioned on wall 264 aligned with
          member 252 so that the impact of member 252 may fire the
          detonator. The detonator may be operably connected to some
          utilization means such as an explosive, a pyrotechnic in a
          thermal battery or the member could perform directly dome
          mechanical functions such as forming or shearing materials.</font>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Figure 15 illustrates a
          mechanism for supporting heavy loads using a plurality of
          groups of rotatable members. As shown in Figure 15, a load 176
          may be supported between a pair of roller-band devices 278 and
          280. Since each device is essentially identical, only device
          278 will be described in detail.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In device 278, a plurality
          of rotatable members, each group including a pair of adjacent
          rotatable members 282 and 284, may be held under tension
          between guideway walls 286 and 288 and end walls 290 and 291
          by a tension band 292. Tension band 292 may be fastened at
          either end to walls 286 and 288 in the same manner as
          described above after being threaded around each of the
          members 282 an 284 of each pair as shown in generally S-shaped
          configuration. A group of idler roller 294 may then be
          inserted between tension band 292 and the load 276 adjacent
          and between members 284 in slot 296 in wall 288.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The load is supported
          between devices 278 and 280 by a second group of idler rollers
          298 in a similar slot in device 280.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Any number of groups of
          rotatable members may be used depending on the size of the
          load. Additional load bearing capability may be obtained by
          using one or more additional rows of rotatable members aligned
          with each group of members 282 and 284 and reverse looping the
          tension band along each row in the same manner as shown as
          long as the summation of diameters of the rotatable members in
          any one group is greater than the distance between the
          supporting walls 286 and 288.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The device 332 shown in
          Figure 16 includes a guideway having an outer tubular member
          or wall 334 and an inner concentric circular member or wall
          335, which may be a cylinder as shown. A plurality of groups
          of rotatable members 336 and 338 is positioned within the
          guideway formed by walls 334 and 334 and held in place by
          continuous tension band 340. Tension band 340 is held under
          tension and away from walls 334 and 335 by the restraining
          force created between the rotatable members and the guideway
          walls. Each rotatable member is shown as a hollow cylinder.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Roller-band device 332 may
          be a bearing used to support a rotating shaft represented by
          circular wall 336 of the guideway. Since tension band 340
          maintains the axes of the rotatable members in parallel, the
          normal end effects and losses in conventional roller bearings
          is obviated. Further, since there is little or no relative
          motion between contiguous parts of the roller-band device, the
          device substantially exhibits only pure rolling motion.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The roller-band devices
          shown in Figures 6-14 above may be easily constructed using
          microminiature modular techniques by making a wide range of
          devices with the same general modular components. These
          devices may use a guideway formed from stock extruded square
          tubing having cross section dimensions of about 0.25 x 0.25
          inch and lengths from about 0.312 to 1.25 inches with an
          average volume of about 0.5 cubic inch. Rollers may be
          fabricated having diameters ranging from 0.115 to 0.205 inch
          which may then be paired to perform any desired function. Some
          rollers may be bored with a standard orifice as shown in
          Figure 9 which may then be fitted with conventional
          obstructions to create a desired leakage and damping. Standard
          force bias type tension bands (see Figure 3) and multiple
          conductor bands (see Figure 4) may be produced and desired
          force biasing applied by photographic etching or other
          conventional techniques.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">These devices may be built
          to operate from a breakaway force between 0.002 G to 7,000 G
          and measure G-seconds over a range of from about 0.25 G-second
          to 200 G-seconds. The devices may also perform a wide range of
          functions or detect a complex force pattern and generate
          multiple indications thereof within an extremely small package
          and with a relatively small number of parts.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A roller-band device may
          operate at substantially lower friction than comparable
          devices under the same operating conditions (in some cases
          having a coefficient of friction as low as 0.0001). Thus under
          many extreme operating conditions where lubricants cannot
          normally be used, the devices can operate with a minimum of
          wear and friction. If it is desired and conditions permit,
          lubricants may be used to decrease still further the rolling
          friction losses.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Because these devices
          exhibit exceedingly low coefficients of friction and may
          substantially eliminate surface roughness losses which in many
          instances where used in prior condition sensing devices to
          effect good electrical contacts, these devices may employ high
          normal forces between electrical contacts without seriously
          degrading accuracy of the device.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">While for purposes of
          illustration various features are shown in different views, it
          will be clear that the majority of features may be embodied
          into a single device. It will also be understood that various
