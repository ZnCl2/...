      Inventor: KEMENY TIBOR [SE] &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      Applicant: ARIES MOTOR CO [SE] &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      A new electric circuit system for electric cars, etc. is
      characterized as follows: a) a closed circuit system of two
      battery groups consisting of six&nbsp; batteries (1-3, 4-6)
      connected with each other in series, and likewise batteries
      (21-23, 24-26) also connected with each other in series; b) two
      condensers (9, 10) in the one battery group separate batteries
      (1-3 and 4-6) from one another, and two other condensers (29, 30)
      in the other battery group which separate batteries (21, 23) and
      (24-26) from each other; c) that when alternating discharges
      between the negative poles of condensers (9, 10) and (29, 30)
      occur, a hitherto unknown alternating current is brought about
      which is without resistance, tension an loss of heat and which is
      not governed by Ohm's law.; <br>
      <br>
      This new alternating current is called "Cold Electricity". d)
      using this new electric circuit system the power of the electric
      car can be enhanced further if condensers (9, 10, 51, 52, 53, 54)
      are connected with each other in parallel. At the same time,
      however the number of thyristors is also increased.<br>
      <br>
      The object of this invention is 2 new electric circuit system,
      which during the period of research was christened "Cold
      Electricity". Technicians in the electronics industry and the
      field of electricity have dreamed of a system which would enable
      electricity to move freely in a conductor without resistance and
      without any loss of the input energy at normal room temperature.<br>
      <br>
      The NEW ELECTRIC CIRCUIT SYSTEM as proposed by the invention is
      based upon the use of two main groups consisting of six batteries
      in each group in which due to the unique construction there is a
      new type of electric current at normal room temperature.<br>
      <br>
      The new electric circuit system, which has the characteristics
      indicated in the claims below, is not subject to Ohm's law. The
      new electric circuit will have applications which will have a
      world-wide market, such as street illumination,household and
      industrial applications and electric motors and electric cars.<br>
      <br>
      In all of the aforesaid areas, energy and environmental
      conservation are the key factors for the future. Owing to the
      rigorous requirements in California and especially in Los Angeles
      such products as the electric car have an opportunity to solve the
      disastrous situation facing the entire planet as a result of a
      solution. This invention will be able solve the global
      environmental havoc caused by the exhaust fumes released by
      products coming from the car industry is new electric circuit
      system is well adapted to run electric motors and electric cars
      since the system works without resistance so tat the current flows
      freely in the motor circuit, an where is accordingly no loss of
      energy. All of this takes place at normal temperatures.<br>
      <br>
      This new electric circuit system, in combination with a specially
      constructed electric motor, is more competitive than today's
      electric cars vis-à-vis conventional petrol-and diesel-powered
      cars.<br>
      <br>
      The invention will be described referring to the following
      figures.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Fig.1 shows one of the battery groups consisting of six
        batteries. </b><br>
      <br>
      Batteries 1-3 are connected with each other in series as are
      batteries 4-6. Batteries 1-3 and 4-6 joined in series are
      separated by two specially constructed power condensers 9,10. The
      two manual switches 7,8 are, in fact, thyristors or switch
      transistors for high power, the function of which is effected by
      means of a control circuit (not included in the drawing) in which
      the frequency ranges from 0 upwards. 11 and 12 show transformers
      and appertaining bridge-connected rectifiers 13,14. At higher
      frequencies power transistors and transformers without iron cores
      should be used. 19 is an electromagnet positioned an an
      appertaining specially constructed electric motor. (The motor is
      not included in the drawing), The current flows alternatingly
      between the negative poles 9, 10 of the condensers through line
      20. The inventor has named this current "Cold Electricity."<br>
      <br>
      This current does not have tension but does,on the other hand,
      maintain its ampere strength. Since the current flows without
      resistance through the motor wiring, it can be called current
      without Watts, without loss of energy or heat and not subject to
      Ohm's law. This is a new electrical circuit system for, all
      electric motors and electric cars.<br>
      <b><br>

      </b><b>Fig.3 shows the possibilities, for example, of connecting
        in parallel or in series the one battery group 1-3 and the other

      The condensers 9,10 in Fig.1 can accordingly be further connected
      in parallel with a number of condensers, e.g. 51, 52, 53 and 54,
      which are separated from each other by diodes 63, 64, 65, 66, 67,
      68, 69 and 70. Each extra condenser 51, 52,53,54 has its own
      thyristor 55, 56, 57, 58, which in turn are connected to the
      positive poles of condensers 51, 52, 53, 54 together with a
      primary wire, which is connected to the transformers 11, 12. Each
      unit has a stator 59, 60 and wires 61, 62. The batteries 1-3 and
      4-6 belong to Fig.1. Fig.2 can accordingly be reversed and used in
      the context of Fig.1 as indicated in Fig.4.<br>
      <br>
      Fig.1 indicates that when thyristor 8 is switched on the condenser
      10 is charged on battery 1, positive pole, and battery 5, negative
      pole, while thyristor 7 is switched off.<br>
      <br>
      When thyristor 7 switches on, condenser 9 is charged on battery 4,
      positive pole, and battery 3,negative pole, while thyristor 8
      switches off. Simultaneously condenser 10 is discharged through
      the primary wire 11 of the transformer, and, in the same moment
      there is a secondary induction, which is rectified by bridge 14,
      and in lines +15 and -16 the current is conducted on to batteries
      24-26, Fig. 2. With the discharge of each condenser, a battery
      group is charged.<br>
      <br>
      As a rule, the group which is not delivering current is always
      charged. When the thyristor 8 switches on, condenser 9 discharges
      via primary wire 12 of the transformer, and simultaneously is
      rectified on secondary induction current by bridge 13, and this
      induction current charges the batteries 21-23 Fig. 2. <br>
      <br>
      Meanwhile condenser 10, by way of example, is recharged. When
      condenser 10 is charged, the other condenser 9 is discharged, and
      vice-versa.<br>
      <br>
      Between the negative poles of the two condensers a new electric
      current is generated, the movement of which is affected by the
      electric vacuum of the condensers. In tis way a new type of
      alternating current is created.<br>
      <br>
      The function of Fig.2 is the same as is described in Fig.1.<br>
      <br>
      The secondary current indicated in Fig.2 also charges the
      batteries as indicated in Fig.1, and so forth.<br>
      <br>
      The power of the electric motor can be further enhanced if several
      condensers are connected in parallel and, at the same, if the
      number of thyristors is also increased. When thyristor 7 switches
      on, condensers 9,53,54 are charged fro battery 4, positive pole,
      and battery 3 negative pole. When thyristor 8 switches on,
      condensers 10, 51, 52 are charged, simultaneously condenser 9 is
      discharged via the appertaining primary wire which is connected to
      transformer 12 in whose secondary ire.there is induction which
      charges the batteries as indicated in description in Fig.1.<br>
      <br>
      In line 20 a new alternating current product is brought about
      which polarizes stator 19 to the north or south pole.<br>
      <br>
      Stator 59 belonging to thyristor 57 is located in the motor and
      has a 120 degree staggering in relation to the original position
      of stator 19. The ignition of thyristor 57 also has a time
      staggering of 120 degrees in relation to the discharge of stator
      19. Condenser 51 discharges in the same way as does condenser 10.
      The new alternating current is connected to the negative pole of
      condenser 53 via line 61 and stator 59, and at the same time, it
      polarizes stator 59 with corresponding poles. Stator 60, which
      belongs to thyristor 56, in turn, also has a 120 degree staggering
      in the motor in relation to stator 59; thyristor 56 also has a
      time staggering of 120 degrees.<br>
      <br>
      The positive current of condenser 54 flows through the primary
      wire of transformer 12, which, in turn, induces current into its
      secondary wire as has been <br>
      previously described in Figure<br>
      <br>
      The new alternating current is connected to the negative pole of
      condenser 52 via wire 62 and stator 60, and, at the same time, it
      polarizes the poles of <br>
      stator 60.<br>
      <br>
      Thyristors 7,8/ 57,55/58,56 have a time staggering to each other
      of 120 degrees.<br>
      <br>
      Fig.2 has an inverted drawing as indicated in Fig.4 in relation to
      Fig.1.<br>
