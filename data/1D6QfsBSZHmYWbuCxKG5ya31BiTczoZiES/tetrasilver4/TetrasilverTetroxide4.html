      <div align="center"><font size="+1"><b>Tetrasil (Imusil)</b></font><br>
      </div>
      <b><br>
      </b>Tetrasil, also known as Imusil, is a fake-AIDS cure that is
      based on tetrasilver tetroxide, a chemical used to clean pool
      water. Apparently, people are supposed to believe that because a
      tiny amount of this highly dangerous chemical kills bacteria and
      virii in swimming water, that a larger amount will kill infections
      in humans. Of course, it is well known that it is poisonous to
      drink rubbing alcohol. Not many people are familiar with
      tetrasilver tetroxide. This is like saying that because you can
      use rubbing alcohol to clean a cut or scrape, you should drink it
      to kill a cold virus. This ‘cure’ is more likely to poison the
      user than help fight the disease.<br>
      <br>
      Of course, the marketers of Tetrasil, like most proponents of fake
      cures, can’t have a single explanation for how their cure works.
      Apparently the more extreme and outrageous the claims the better.
      So, in addition to the ‘fact’ that tetrasilver tetroxide is used
      in pool ‘proves’ that it is safe to ingest and will kill
      infections, these tiny molecules are actually machines that
      generate electricity and kill the AIDS virus, HIV, by zapping it
      with electricity. (This claim is straight from the US patent for
      Tetrasil, by the way. For those who don’t know – you can file a
      patent for anything, including a time machine that will take you
      to a non-existent universe. The patent office doesn’t care if the
      thing works, just if you are copying someone else. So if you ever
      see anyone waving around a patent as proof that their crazy claim
      is valid – all it proves it no one else was crazy enough to want
      to claim the idea.)<br>
      <br>
      It is, however, very very interesting that the patent claims that
      Tetrasil cures AIDS by electrocuting HIV, since the patent is held
      by a ‘Dr’. Marvin S. Antelman, the maker of Tetrasil, who claims
      that HIV has nothing to do with AIDS! Alright ‘Dr.’ Antelman, I’ll
      give you the benefit of the doubt. Assuming that HIV has nothing
      to do with AIDS, how do you cure a disease by killing something
      that is totally unrelated to it?<br>
      <br>
      You can’t. And you can’t cure AIDS without attacking HIV. Which is
      just one more proof that the so-called doctor doesn’t know what he
      is talking about and is just out to make a buck. Illogical claims
      like this can be sold to people if the seller talks fast enough
      and doesn’t give them time to stop and question the absurdity of
      it, but a legitimate health professional wants people to ask
      questions, wants to have problems pointed out so they can be
      corrected. And a legitimate health worker does not make ridiculous
      claims that directly contradict his OWN PATENT!<br>
      <br>
      That isn’t the only difference between ‘Dr.’ Antelman and a
      legitimate health worker. There are quite a few more. Among them,
      a real researcher wants other people to test their findings, and
      make sure their medicines work. This is called ‘third party
      testing’. A researcher wants this for two reasons. First, someone
      else doing the testing in a different way can make sure they
      didn’t miss anything in their work. Second, it’s a promise to
      their customers – ‘I have let my work be examined by other people,
      who agree that it works and is safe.’ Apparently, ‘Dr.’ Antelman
      feels neither of these are valid concerns, as the company he keep
      proclaiming has tested Tetrasil and found it safe and effective,
      is one that he owns. So basically he is saying ‘I have tested my
      own invention and proved to myself that it is safe and will work –
      and you can take my word for it!’<br>
      <br>
      Worse, it isn’t safe, as Antelman’s own reported test results
      prove. All but one of the people who took part in Antelman’s
      ‘clinical test’ of Tetrasil developed hepatomegaly or enlarged
      livers. An enlarged liver only happens when a person has developed
      a serious medical condition such as liver disease, congestive
      heart failure or cancer! Of course, ‘Dr’. Antleman insists that
      none of the test participants were harmed, and that an enlarged
      liver is not dangerous. No, an enlarged liver doesn’t endanger a
      person – but the problems that cause it DO! Of course, Antleman
      couldn’t be bothered to test for further problems that might have
      led his patients to develop hepatomegaly.<br>
      <br>
      Yet this man, who wants us to take his word, has already
      contradicted himself about how his so-called ‘cure’ works and
      claims it is safe while publicly announcing that his test subjects
      developed medical problems. It’s hard to trust someone who won’t
      play straight, who contradicts himself, and is not open and
      aboveboard.<br>
      <br>
      At this time, Tetrasil is banned in Zambia because it has no
      proven effects for people living with HIV. It is still legal to
      sell in America (people need to be able to disinfect their pools)
      but it is illegal to promote it as a treatment or preventative for
      any disease.<br>

      <div align="center"><b>Zambia Bans Untested AIDS Cures</b><br>
        <b>November 01, 2009</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      In Zambia, the government has introduced a law to protect people
      infected with the AIDS virus, HIV, from drugs that could harm
      their health. The law will require all anti-AIDS medications
      coming into the country to undergo clinical testing before being
      sold on the local market. From Lusaka, Danstan Kaunda has the
      story.<br>
      <br>
      Many HIV patients in Zambia have abandoned life-prolonging
      anti-retroviral drugs for what is said to be a miracle cure,
      called ‘Tetrasil.’<br>
      <br>
      Tetrasil appeared on the local market shortly after a Zambian
      weekly newspaper published a story saying it can cure HIV with 21
      days.<br>
      <br>
      The tabloid quoted a controversial US-based California activist,
      Boyd Graves, who said over 10 HIV patients have been disease-free
      since January.<br>
      <br>
      Graves has also said the U.S government manufactured the HIV virus
      in a lab – a charge disputed by the mainstream scientific
      community. According to the Atlanta-based Centers for Disease
      Control, a team of international researchers reported in 1999 that
      they had traced the origins of HIV-1, the predominant strain of
      HIV in the developed world, to chimpanzees in west equatorial
      Africa. The CDC's web page says, "The researchers believe that
      HIV-1 was introduced into the human population when hunters became
      exposed to infected blood." (www.cdc.gov/hiv/resources/qa/qa3.htm)<br>
      <br>
      In response to the controversy over the alleged cure, the
      government of Zambia has banned a local chemist – a sister company
      to the tabloid that published the claims – from selling Tetrasil.
      The government has also banned any press advertisements for it.<br>
      <br>
      Under the new law, the Pharmaceutical Regulatory Authority of the
      Ministry of Health will test the safety and efficacy of all drugs
      and natural remedies, whether they are western medications or
      locally available herbs.<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Canisius Banda is a spokesperson in the Ministry of Health.<br>
      <br>
      "A technical working group," he said, "will be put in place to
      study these claims through scientific scrutiny, and if the drug
      (Tetrasil) passes the tests, than we will find ways on how will it
      be rolled out to the public, because it has to be an orderly
      process. We are saying that about 1.6 million people in Zambia are
      living with the HIV virus. Seventy-six thousand of them are on
      ARVs (antiretrovirals), and about 200,000 need to be on them. So
      if the process is not managed properly there could be a stampede
      or chaos."<br>
      <br>
      Banda said claims of a cure for HIV / AIDS are often false – and
      hurt efforts to protect those infected – like government programs
      to provide free anti-retrovirals to pregnant mothers.<br>
      <br>
      "Derailing government programs is not a wise thing to encourage,"
      he said, "because it can threaten national security, and again
      that is a criminal activity. We will continue with the measures in
      place, but also encourage people with these claims, so that they
      are submitted to the ministry for scientific verification."<br>
      <br>
      Meanwhile, the Network of Zambian People Living with HIV and AIDS
      wants the government to arrest anyone found selling Tetrasil.<br>
      <br>
      Zambia has one of Africa’s highest infection rates – with about 16
      percent of its population of 11 million infected. <br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      The often called silver peroxide and silver(II) oxide, AgO or
      Ag2O2, is actually a mixed oxidation state silver(I,III) oxide. A
      thermochemical cycle, with lattice energies calculated within the
      "volume-based" thermodynamic approach, explain why the
      silver(I,III) oxide is more stable than the hypothetical
      silver(II) oxide. The coordination geometries of silver and copper
      in their known oxides correlate with those associated to their
      electron configurations in coordination compounds. The second
      ionization energy is higher for Ag than for Cu, which can be
      related to the small size of 3d orbitals and the resulting high
      electron repulsion for the first transition series elements.<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      AIM: Venous ulcers are a common, chronic medical and social
      problem. These ulcers are difficult to heal in most patients with
      sustained venous hypertension. This pilot product evaluation
      registry study has evaluated the efficacy and safety of an
      antimicrobial silver oxide wound dressing ointment ("Silver Oxide
      Ointment") as part of the treatment of 'difficult' venous
      ulcerations.<br>
      <br>
      METHODS: The study was conducted measuring the variations in the
      area of the ulceration and microcirculatory parameters.<br>
      <br>
      RESULTS: After four weeks, treatment with the Silver Oxide
      Ointment proved more effective than the 'best management' used in
      controls. Transcutaneous PO2 was increased (improved); Laser
      Doppler skin flux and transcutaneous PCO2 were improved
      (decreased). Also in the silver oxide group a significantly higher
      number of venous ulcers were completely healed at four weeks. The
      silver oxide ointment improved both the microcirculation and the
      healing rate of their ulcers. No significant tolerability problems
      were observed.<br>
      <br>
      CONCLUSION: In difficult venous ulcerations, local treatment with
      this Silver Oxide Ointment, as one component of the total wound
      dressing, improved microcirculation measurements and healing rate.
      Most of the treatments were done at home by the patients or by
      their tutors. This study indicates the important role of this type
      of treatment and indicates the need to plan larger and more
      prolonged studies.<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      AIM: In addition to contemporary compression therapy, one of the
      therapeutic approaches is the use of a topical wound care agent.
      The goal of this pilot registry study is to evaluate the efficacy
      and safety of a uniquely designed ointment containing multivalent
      silver oxide (Ag4O4) in the healing of difficult diabetic or
      venous ulcerations.<br>
      <br>
      METHODS: Patients who had ulcers resulting from chronic venous
      insufficiency or diabetes participated in this open-label,
      randomized registry study. All patients were evaluated by
      measuring both the area of the ulceration and microcirculatory
      parameters. 148 patients were included in the study and
      categorized into two main groups: venous ulcers and diabetic
      ulcers. Each main group was then randomized into two sub-groups:
      topical treatment with silver oxide ointment and the control group
      (standard cleaning and compression management methods, without
      silver ointment). All patients were treated with accepted cleaning
      and compression management. RESULTS. In subjects with venous
      ulcers: After 4 weeks, the silver treatment was more effective
      than the control group treatment: Skin PO2 was increased 2.1 times
      more than the control group (17.4% to 8.2%) and skin flux (RF) was
      improved 1.6 times more than the control group (-38.7% to -24.2%).
      The total surface area of the ulcer was significantly reduced in
      the silver treatment group by 1.9 times the control group (-88.7%
      to -46.9%). In addition, in the silver treatment group we observed
      complete closure of the ulceration in 42% of subjects compared to
      22% in the control group (P=&lt;0.05). In subjects with diabetic
      ulcers: after 4 weeks, the silver treatment was more effective
      than the control group treatment: Skin PO2 increased 2.6 times
      more than the control group (23.3% to 9.1%) and skin flux (RF) was
      significantly improved 4.3 times more than the control
      group(-26.7% to -6.2%). The total surface area of the ulcer was
      significantly reduced in the silver treatment group by 3.7 times
      the control group (-89.0% to -23.9%). In addition, in the silver
      treatment group we observed complete closure of the ulceration in
      39% of subjects compared to 16% in the control group
      (P&lt;/=0.05).<br>
      <br>
      CONCLUSION: This pilot study provides observational data on the
      efficacy of local treatment of ulcers with a multivalent silver
      oxide containing ointment. The silver ointment improved
      microcirculation and the healing rate of all 78 patients that were
      treated with multivalent silver ointment and closed twice as many
      ulcers in 4 weeks compared to the control groups (40.7% silver
      treatment compared to 19.4% for the control). This study
      demonstrates the feasibility of this type of treatment and
      provides evidence of efficacy to plan larger randomized controlled
      studies. The large number of patients that were helped in this
      study demonstrates the efficacy of multivalent silver oxide
      topical ointment and its important role in ulcer therapy.<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      Nanotechnology is the creation of functional materials, devices
      and systems at atomic and molecular scales (1-100 nm), where
      properties differ significantly from those at a larger scale. The
      use of nanotechnology and nanomaterials in medical research is
      growing rapidly. Recently, nanotechnologic developments in
      microbiology have gained importance in the field of chemotherapy.
      Bacterial strains that are resistant to current antibiotics have
      become serious public health problems that raise the need to
      develop new bactericidal materials. Metal oxide nanoparticles,
      especially TiO(2) and Ag(2)O nanoparticles, have demonstrated
      significant antibacterial activity. Therefore, it is thought that
      this property of metal oxide nanoparticles could effectively be
      used as a novel solution strategy. In this review, we focus on the
      unique properties of nanoparticles, their mechanism of action as
      antibacterial agents and recent studies in which the effects of
      visible and UV-light induced TiO(2) and Ag(2)O nanoparticles on
      drug-resistant bacteria have been documented. In addition, from to
      previous results of our studies, antileishmanial effects of metal
      oxide nanoparticles are also demonstrated, indicating that metal
      oxide nanoparticles can also be effective against eukaryotic
      infectious agents. Conversely, despite their significant potential
      in antimicrobial applications, the toxicity of metal oxide
      nanoparticles restricts their use in humans. However, recent
      studies infer that metal oxide nanoparticles have considerable
      potential to be the first-choice for antibacterial and
      antiparasitic applications in the future, provided that
      researchers can bring new ideas in order to cope with their main
      problem of toxicity.<br>

      Tetrasil (Terrasil) attacks bacterial, viral, and fungal
      infections like no other skin cream or ointment. It is highly
      recommended to relieve itching, rashes, redness, burning and other
      unwanted symptoms of skin infections. Customers say the result is
      not just rapid relief of symptoms, but the entire elimination of
      the root causes of these ailments.<br>
      <br>
      Laboratory analysis, clinical studies, and patient feedback has
      convinced Dr. Horowitz that Tetrasil's active ingredient,
      Tetrasilver Tetroxide, interacts with the surfaces of bacterial,
      fungal and viral membranes to help people heal better and faster
      than any other product in its class.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      <b>Features &amp; Ingredients</b><br>
      <br>
      Upon contact, TETRASIL's unique chemical structure releases both a
      micro-electrical charge and therapeutic oxygen, which immediately
      begins to kill pathogens.<br>
      Dr. Horowitz expects this product, and advertisment, will be
      attacked vigorously by the FDA simply because it works so well, at
      such low cost, without any risks of toxicity when used correctly,
      and without dangerous side effects presented by all pharmaceutical
      antibiotics. (See instructions.)<br>

      Hello parents and family members of autistic children:<br>
      <br>
      I have found some interesting information about the RNA viruses
      associated with autism.&nbsp; RNA viruses for HIV and cancer are
      inhibited by Tetrasilver Tetroxide US Pat 5676977 and US Pat
      6485755 respectively.<br>
      <br>
      Association of Autism with Polyoma Virus Infection in Postmortem
      Brains.<br>
      Journal Neurovirology, 2010 March – Lintas C, Altieri L, Lombardi
      F, Sacco R, Persico AM.Laboratory of Molecular Psychiatry and
      Neurogenetics, University Campus Bio-Medico, Rome, Italy.[1]<br>
      <br>
      These viruses were found in the brain DNA of 15 autistic children
      in Italy who died by 2010 but had diagnoses of autism.&nbsp;&nbsp;
      How did the JC virus from the US and the BK virus from the US
      survive from 1971 until 2010 for 39 years?&nbsp; Tissue decomposes
      when someone dies usually within 3 months in a moist climate {see
      http://fac.utk.edu/}<br>
      <br>
      Interestingly to note there were a total of FIVE herpes viruses
      and two people viruses from patients who died in 1971 in the
      US!&nbsp; Lastly Lintas found the AIDS or HIV virus from green
      monkeys’ kidneys.&nbsp; This virus has been called the SV-40 virus
      and first was named the SE Polyoma virus for Dr. Bernice Eddy,
      PhD, and Dr Sarah Stewart, MD, PhD who found it in polio vaccine
      complement used in the 1950s through 1963.&nbsp; They found that
      the SE Polyoma virus could cause cancer in many animal species and
      feared that it would cause cancer in humans.[2]<br>
      <br>
      Carla Lintas found these RNA viruses: cytomegalovirus (CMV),
      Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV1),
      herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV2), human herpes virus 6 (HHV6),
      BK virus (BKV), JC virus (JCV), and simian virus 40 (SV40) in

      Who is BK of the bkvirus and what family is it in?<br>
      <br>
      The BK virus was first isolated in 1971 from the urine of a renal
      transplant patient, initials B.K.[3]The BK virus is similar to
      another virus called the JCV since their genome sequences share
      75% homology. [Essentially these viruses are very identical they
      share 75% of the same genome sequences but BK and JC were not
      related humans.]&nbsp; Polyomaviridae is&nbsp; the bkvirus family.
      ] Polyoma is the genus of the bkvirus and jcvirus.&nbsp; Both of
      these viruses can be identified and differentiated from each other
      by carrying out serological tests using specific antibodies or by
      using a PCR based genotyping approach.<br>
      <br>
      Who is JC of the jcvirus?<br>
      <br>
      The jcvirus was from a patient with progressive multifocal
      leukoencephalopathy (PML).[4]<br>
      <br>
      Why are the animal and herpes RNA viruses mentioned in the work of
      Carla Lintas so significant?<br>

      Autism is a highly heritable behavioral disorder. Yet, two decades
      of genetic investigation have unveiled extremely few cases that
      can be solely explained on the basis of de novo mutations or
      cytogenetic abnormalities. Vertical viral transmission represents
      a nongenetic mechanism of disease compatible with high
      parent-to-offspring transmission and with low rates of
      disease-specific genetic abnormalities. Vertically transmitted
      viruses should be found more frequently in the affected tissues of
      autistic individuals compared to controls. Our initial step was
      thus to assess by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA
      sequence analysis the presence of cytomegalovirus (CMV)[Herpes
      Virus V], Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)[Herpes Virus iV], herpes
      simplex virus type 1 (HSV1), herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV2),
      human herpes virus 6 (HHV6)[Herpes Virus known as roseola or
      measles such as measles vaccine], BK virus (BKV)[from BK’s
      kidney], JC virus (JCV)[from JC’s brain leukoencechalopathy], and
      simian virus 40 (SV40)[from a West African green monkey kidney] in
      genomic DNA extracted from postmortem temporocortical tissue
      (Brodmann areas 41/42) belonging to 15 autistic patients and 13
      controls. BKV, JCV, and SV40 combined are significantly more
      frequent among autistic patients compared to controls (67% versus
      23%, respectively; P &lt; .05). The majority of positives yielded
      archetypal sequences, whereas six patients and two controls
      unveiled single-base pair changes in two or more sequenced clones.
      No association is present with the remaining viruses, which are
      found in relatively few individuals (N &lt;/= 3). Also polyviral
      infections tend to occur more frequently in the brains of autistic
      patients compared to controls (40% versus 7.7%, respectively; P =
      .08). Follow-up studies exploring vertical viral transmission as a
      possible pathogenetic mechanism in autistic disorder should focus
      on, but not be limited to, the role of polyoma viruses. PMID:

      </b><br>
      At present, the research and application of bactericides mainly
      focus on the medicaments for preventing and curing the diseases
      caused by fungi, and the research and development of medicaments
      for preventing and curing diseases caused by bacteria and viruses
      is not enough. Silver bactericidal effect has long been found in
      recent years, people in the process of sterilizing silver
      sterilization, but also gradually want to apply the principle of
      sterilizing silver products to go, but the market has not yet as a
      bactericide to prevent bacteria and viruses , And the example
      applied to the product appears. In the July 2005 issue of "Chinese
      Journal of New Drugs and Clinical Medicine", "Progress in the
      research of medicinal silver tetraoxide" was reported, indicating
      that it is expected to become a novel antimicrobial agent and be
      used in the treatment of AIDS, cancer and other diseases .<br>
      <br>
      <b>Content of the invention</b><br>
      <br>
      Object of the Invention: The purpose of the present invention is
      to provide a four-silver tetrabasic bactericide prepared from
      tetra-silver tetraoxide, a preparation method thereof and its use
      as a bactericidal additive.<br>
      <br>
      Technical solution: a silver tetrabasic fungicide, which comprises
      the following components in weight: 800 to 1200 parts of weak
      alkaline solution, 0.1 to 0.5 parts of silver tetraoxide, and 8 to

      <br>
      According to two kinds of fungicide mechanism of action: ① by
      interfering with the respiratory process of germs, inhibit the
      production of energy to kill bacteria. ② interfere with microbial
      life substances such as proteins, nucleic acids, alcohols and
      other biosynthesis to kill bacteria. Tetraoxide silver tetraoxide
      prepared four silver fungicides as fungicides belong to the second
      type of mechanism of action. The mechanism of Ag4O4 was analyzed.
      The antibacterial order of Ag4O4 was: Ag &lt;3 +&gt; Ag &lt;2
      +&gt; Ag &lt;1+&gt;, and Ag4O4 was a kind of Ag4O4 with A unique
      conformation of "multivalent silver" oxide that redox reactions
      with exposed 2N and 2S groups on the protein surface produces
      electrical kill and chelation that result in altered protein
      conformation. Its mechanism of action is different from the
      general antimicrobial agents, the mode of action is not easy to
      cause the pathogen resistance or mutation, no toxicity to normal
      tissues, with anti-microbial and anti-inflammatory cells.<br>
      <br>
      Beneficial effects: Four silver tetraoxide interferes with the
      function of preventing biosynthesis of bacterial cells, especially
      bacteria and viruses, and antimicrobial plastic products,
      antimicrobial fiber products, antibacterial fabrics , Against
      various pathogenic microorganisms caused by plant diseases,
      medical equipment and reagent additives, antibacterial coatings
      and antibacterial ware widely used in these fields, with good
      inhibition of bacteria, viruses, the preparation method of the
      present invention is simple, suitable for large Scale industrial
      production, application method is simple and practical.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Detailed description</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The present invention will be further described below in
      combination with specific embodiments.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 1: Preparation of tetrad silver oxide bactericide.</b><br>

      The reagent containing the silver tetrafluoroborate obtained in
      Example 1 was sprayed on the air filter element to naturally cure
      and dry the air filter element with antibacterial effect.
      Tetraoxide silver fungicide can also be added in the form of
      plastic coupling agent, about to dissolve the solution of tetrad
      silver anti-bacterial agent sprayed on the plastic particles, and
      then dried to use.<br>
      <br>
      After testing, spray sterilized four four silver oxide
      air-conditioning filter in Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus

      <br>
      The tetracycline antimicrobial agent obtained in Example 1 was
      directly combined with the air conditioning case in the form of a
      mist or coating on the formed air conditioning case. Because the
      exterior of the air conditioning is very smooth, you can use
      corona treatment, that is, under the action of high voltage
      electric field, the electron current exerts a powerful impact on
      the surface of the air conditioning enclosure, which can make the
      surface of the enclosure furred, roughened and increase the
      surface area. When in contact with its surface, it will create a
      good wetting that will penetrate into the furrows that have been
      pulled, and will be firmly anchored to the plastic shell by
      anchoring. Use this principle, the corona treatment will be four
      silver tetrachloride bactericide spray applied or coated by the
      temperature of 60 ~ 80 ° C for 8 to 12 minutes to dry, so that the
      four silver tetrachloride bactericide by complexation Fixed on the

      add 100 mg of silver tetraoxide fully diluted;<br>
      <br>
      (2)With 0.006 kg of polyvinyl alcohol as a carrier, the solution
      obtained in step (1) was uniformly mixed to obtain 0.5 kg of
      silver tetrafluoroborate bactericide.<br>

      ppm, and the paint or paint was sprayed on handrails, computers,
      telephones, toys, wood floors and the like frequently. More
      bacteria were used Of the items, so that spray paint, paint items
      with antibacterial effect.<br>
      <br>
      After testing, spray paint containing antifouling agent of
      tetraoxide, paint handrails, computers, telephones, toys and
      wooden floors, etc., Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus,
      Klebsiella pneumoniae, Aerobacter aerogenes, orange Gram-positive
      bacteria, bacteria mixed kind of survival rates are 0, we can see
      that four silver tetrabuicides kill bacteria and fungi have the
      role.<br>

      <br>
      SILVERQUINE Animal Wound Dressing is a water-base hydro gel wound
      dressing for use in moist wound care management. The gel contains
      silver that may help inhibit the growth of microorganisms within
      the dressing. SILVERQUINE Animal Wound Dressing Gel has been
      evaluated in standard tests that show it can reduce the level of
      common microorganisms.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Indications for Use:<b> </b>Topical management of Minor Cuts,
      Lacerations, Abrasions, 1st and 2nd Degree Burns, Skin Irritations<br>
      <br>
      It has been known for over a century that certain preparations of
      silver have germicidal properties. As a result, prior to the
      invention of modern day antibiotics, silver was used to help treat
      wounds and other types of infections in animals. With the
      development of natural antibiotics, silver preparations were
      phased out in favor of synthetic antibiotics. Unfortunately, over
      the course of the past 25 years, multiple bacteria have developed
      resistance to common antibiotics on the market today. In some
      circumstances, prolonged courses of expensive antibiotics have to
      be used to get a minimal response and expose your pet to potent
      side effects. Worse yet, some antibiotics are totally ineffective
      in some cases. As a result, the pet industry is in urgent need of
      new technology that has broad spectrum antimicrobial activity to
      reduce wound healing times and reduce the risk of side effects
      from current treatments.<br>
      <br>
      Silverquine Animal Wound Dressing is a new, unique,
      nano-particulate based silver that is very different from the
      synthetic antibiotics used for the past 80 years in the animal
      arena. Our technology is ALL NATURAL and contains no alcohol or
      synthetic chemicals that inhibit stem cell activity or
      epithelization. In addition, the silver in our animal wound
      dressing gel is not just another silver. Silverquine Animal Wound
      Dressing consists of silver nanomolecules (less than .015
      micrometers in size) with an interior metallic silver and an
      exterior of ionic silver suspended within a water molecule.<br>
      <br>
      <b>How Does it Work?</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Silverquine Animal Wound Dressing Gel is manufactured using a
      patented technology to produce metallic silver nanoparticles (Ag0)
      coated with tetrasilver tetroxide (Ag4O4). The silver hydro-gel
      has both ionic and covalent properties. The metallic core (Ag0)
      facilitates continuous electron transfer, versus an action of
      single-electron transfer per silver ion. <br>
      <br>
      The ingredients in Silverquine Animal Wound Dressing Gel are all
      natural. In addition to the patented, unique, nano-particles of
      silver, the product also contains purified water, TEA, and
      carbomer. TEA (triethanolamine) and carbomer are organic products
      that are mixed together in very low concentrations to form a gel.
      Our Silverquine Gel product contains these two ingredients in
      minute concentrations for a gelling effect. Both of these
      ingredients are commonly used in cosmetic products for animals and
      are considered very safe.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      <b>Safety</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The key antimicrobial agent in Silverquine Animal Wound Dressing
      Gel is the patented silver nanoparticles. For the past 15 years,
      there has been a significant push to use the lowest possible dose
      effective to treat an infection. Lower doses typically result in
      fewer side effects. For example, one of the most common topical
      therapies currently used in the pet industry is silver
      sulfadiazine cream. That product contains 10,000ppm of silver.
      Such high concentrations often time leads to wound maceration and
      the need for debridement of some skin around the infected wound
      area. Such high concentrations can have a negative impact on stem
      cell activity and epithelization (new skin growth and wound
      closing) resulting in slower wound healing. Ironically, our
      products containing Silverquine Animal Wound Dressing Gel contains
      less than 100ppm of silver, does not negatively impact stem cell
      activity and epithelization, and promotes effective wound healing.<br>
      <br>
      Silverquine Animal Wound Dressing Gel has been studied in a series
      of safety studies including animals. These safety and toxicology
      studies have demonstrated safe, beneficial, and non-toxic data.<br>
