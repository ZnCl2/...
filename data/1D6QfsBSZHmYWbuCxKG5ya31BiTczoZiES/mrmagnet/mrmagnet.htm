      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The Magnet’s Secret:</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Since the electromagnet’s
          windings are powered by AC, an alternately increasing and
          decreasing magnetic field is set up in its center core. When
          this varying field passes through a set of copper washers
          fastened to the end of the core, a large current is induced in
          them. The washers, then, act essentially as a transformer
          secondary.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The induced current sets up
          a strong, varying magnetic field in the washers. And the
          direction of this field is such that the washers and the core
          repel each other. If the washers were not anchored in place,
          they would spring out of their mounting as soon as the current
          was turned on.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The point is, though, that
          the varying field in the washers will induce, in turn, a large
          current in any metal object (ferrous or not) brought near
          them. This current, of course, sets up a magnetic field in the
          object. And the direction of the field will always be such
          that the part of the object in contact with the outside face
          of the set of washers will move the opposite magnetic polarity
          fro that face. Therefore, the object will be attracted.</font>
      </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Building Magnet Cores:</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">To start, first cut a 3-1/2"
          section from a 2" diameter mailing tube. Make a frame for the
          inner core of the magnet as described in <b><a href="#deta">Detail






              "A"</a></b>. In forming the frame the three wooden discs
          should fit snug inside the tube. The four ¼" diameter wooden
          dowels will pass through the discs by holes drilled then glued
          in to place to hold the assembly together. The core material
          will later fill the ¾" diameter hole drilled into the centers
          of the discs.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Now slide the frame into the
          mailing tube spaced ½" from one end and flush on the other end
          and glue in this position. Three copper washers will fill the
          ½" space later on (See <b><a href="#detb">Detail B</a></b>
          Side View).</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Set the closed end of the
          tube down on a table top and proceed to pack the core with
          lamination approximately ¼" wide and 3-1/2" long. Laminations
          may be removed from an old transformer or made from 18 to 22
          gauge soft iron wire cut squarely on one end 3-1/2" long. The
          pieces should make a smooth surface when packed together.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Next, slide a 3-1/2" long,
          3" diameter mailing tube over the completed assembly centered
          as near as possible. Fill the space radially around the inner
          core assembly with laminations like previously used wide
          enough to fit snug and 3-1/2" long (See <b><a href="#detb">Detail







              B</a></b> End View)</font> </p>
      <hr width="62%">
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Winding the Coil:</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">For this step you need a jig
          similar to the one in <b><a href="#detc">Detail C</a></b>.
          This wooden cylinder with two fitted end-pieces is 3-1/2" long
          and 1/16" larger in diameter than the mailing tube’s diameter.
          The end pieces are sawed so that slots are formed to allow
          temporary tie wires&nbsp; (see next paragraph), and a metal
          crank handle runs through the center of the cylinder.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The jig is now ready. Center
          12" pieces of hookup wire in each slot, pressing them flat.
          The coil will be wound over this and the wires will serve to
          temporarily hold the coil together when removed from the jig.
          Next, frill a hole in a block of wood clamped in a vice. This
          will hold the jig as you crank the other end.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The coil is made up of 600
          turns of #14 cotton or enamel-covered magnet wire tapped at
          the 350th turn. Around 9 pounds will be needed. Insert the rod
          end of your jig into the block of wood, stick the first 6" if
          the end of your supply wire through a saw-slot, then start
          winding the wire in layers onto the cylinder.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When the 350th turn is
          reached, tap on a 6" length of wire and brig it out through a
          saw-slot. The point of tapping can be varied as much as 10
          turns in either direction so that the tap out is at the end of
          a layer on the same end a s when we started the coil. Now
          continue until the 600th turn is completed and bring the end
          of the wire out the same end through a saw-slot and cut
          leaving a 6" piece as before.</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Final Assembly:</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Using the wires previously
          inserted, tie the windings together. Disassemble the jig and
          remove the coil. Using ½" wide cotton or linen tape, wrap the
          coil from the inside to the outside in overlapping layers.
          Once completed, coat the inside of the coils and the outside
          of the 3" mailing tube assembly with glue. Make sure the leads
          and the space for the copper washers are on opposite ends,
          insert the cores into the coil, and allow the glue to dry.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">During the drying time make
          a ½" thick wooden ring with the inside diameter&nbsp; [?] wide
          and the outside diameter flush with the outside of the coil.
          This is a spacer between the coil and the top (See <b><a
              href="#detb">Detail B</a></b> Side View). Cut grooves in
          the spacer to allow the leads to pass through the center and
          glue onto the coil.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Now with the same outside
          diameter as the spacer, cut a ½" wooden top. Mount a lifting
          ring in the center, made from brass or copper. Drill another
          hole for a 6’ length of #14 stranded, 3-wire conductor for the
          power cable. Push one end through the hole and connect the
          coil leads to the cable leads.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">At the free end of the power
          cord mark each of the leads as connected with "start of
          winding", "tap", "end of winding". This is important for later
          hook up. Next glue the cable in its hole so connections cannot
          be pulled apart by flexing. The wooden top can be secured to
          the spacer ring by brass wood screws. Next coat the whole
          magnet with black insulating varnish or enamel to help secure
          the cotton or linen coil wrappings and protect it from
          moisture.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The last part of
          construction is the forming and installation of copper washers
          in the space between the ends of the inner and outer magnet
          cores. Specifications of the washers are in <b><a
              href="#detd">Detail D</a></b>.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">These copper washers are
          secured with flathead brass wood screws driven into the inner
          core. Counter sink the screws into the outside washer, and
          fill any excess space between the washers and the inner coil
          with slices of wood or cardboard so the last washer is flush
          with the inner and outer cores.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Do not substitute any other
          metal in place of the copper washers. Heavy current induced by
          the washers require that they be made of extremely low
          resistance metal.</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Electrical Hookup:</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">If the AC line is connected
          between terminals 1 and 2 of the magnet coil (See <b><a
              href="#schemabcd">Schematic A</a></b>), the current
          consumed will be around 20 amperes --- quite excessive for use
          around the house. Connecting terminals 1 and 3 (See <b><a
              href="#schemabcd">Schematic B</a></b>) results in a
          current flowing around 4.25 amperes, and the strength of the
          magnet is reduced proportionately. In both cases the current
          performs little useful work; this inductive circuit lags about
          90* behind the voltage.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This lag can be partially
          offset by adding an 80-uf, phase-shifting capacitance as shown
          in the modified parallel-resonant circuit of <b><a
              href="#schemabcd">Schematic C</a></b>. The current drawn
          from the line is about 4 amperes, while the currents flowing
          between terminals 1 and 2 and terminals 3 and 4, respectively,
          are 18.5 amperes and 9 amperes. This hookup results in a more
          powerful magnet than the hookups in Schematics A or B.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The maximum magnetic pull is
          obtained with the series-resonant circuit illustrated in <b><a
              href="#schemabcd">Schematic D</a></b>. In this hookup, 17
          amperes flow through the whole coil, allowing the coil to pick
          up and hold 6 or more half-dollar coins or an equal weight f
          other non-ferrous metal.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The 80-uf capacitance
          specified in Schematics C and D is built up by paralleling
          several smaller capacitors. These must be of the
          non-electrolytic type with ratings of at least 250 volts if
          connected as in Schematic C, or 600 volts if connected as in
          Schematic D. Units totaling less than 80-uf could be used,
          providing they have the proper voltage ratings, but the
          current flowing through the magnet winding would be reduced.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">High voltage appears across
          the capacitors, and since they are apt to retain their charge
          after being disconnected from the line, this should be
          enclosed in a metal box. As another precaution, the capacitors
          should always be discharged with a tool having an insulated
          handle before any work is done on the circuit.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Because of the peculiarities
          of the magnetic field around the copper washers, the magnet
          will not attract pieces of non-ferrous metal wider than their
          outside diameter or nattower than their inside diameter.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A final word of caution: the
          washers carry considerable current through them and get quite
          hot. Connect the magnets only when necessary.</font> </p>
