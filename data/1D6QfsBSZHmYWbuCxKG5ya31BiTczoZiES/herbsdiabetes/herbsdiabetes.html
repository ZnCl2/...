      Plant-based therapies that have been shown in some studies to have
      anti-diabetic properties include:<br>
      <br>
      <b>Aloe vera… Bilberry extract… Bitter melon… Cinnamon… Fenugreek…
        Ginger… Okra.</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Further herbal therapies<br>
      <br>
      The herbs and plant derivatives listed below have been employed
      traditionally by native people in the treatment of diabetes, in
      the areas in which they grow.<br>
      <br>
      Many suffer from an inadequate knowledge base.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Allium</b><br>
      <br>
      Allium sativum is more commonly known as garlic, and is thought to
      offer antioxidant properties and micro-circulatory effects.
      Although few studies have directly linked allium with insulin and
      blood glucose levels, results have been positive.<br>
      <br>
      Allium may cause a reduction in blood glucose, increase secretion
      and slow the degradation of insulin. Limited data is available
      however, and further trials are needed. <br>
      <br>
      <b>Bauhinia forficata and Myrcia uniflora</b><br>
      <br>
      Bauhinia forficata grows in South America, and is used in
      Brazilian herbal cures. This plant has been referred to as
      ‘vegetable insulin'. Myrcia uniflora is also widely employed in
      South America. Studies utilising the herbs as tea infusions
      suggest that their hypoglycaemic effects are overrated.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Coccinia indica</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Coccinia indica is also known as the ‘ivy gourd’ and grows wild
      across the Indian subcontinent. Traditionally employed in
      ayurverdic remedies, the herb has been found to contain
      insulin-mimetic properties (i.e; it mimics the function of
      insulin).<br>
      <br>
      Significant changes in glycaemic control have been reported in
      studies involving coccinia indica, and experts believe that it
      should be studied further.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Ficus carica</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Ficus carica, or fig-leaf, is well known as a diabetic remedy in
      Spain and South-western Europe, but its active component is
      unknown. Some studies on animals suggest that fig-leaf facilitates
      glucose uptake.<br>
      <br>
      The efficacy of the plant is, however, still yet to be validated
      in the treatment of diabetes.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Ginseng</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Ginseng is a collective name for a variety of different plant
      species.<br>
      <br>
      In some studies utilising American ginseng, decreases in fasting
      blood glucose were reported. Varieties include Korean ginseng,
      Siberian ginseng, American ginseng and Japanese ginseng.<br>
      <br>
      In some fields the plant, particularly the panax species, are
      hailed as ‘cure-all.’ As is the case with many of the herbs
      employed around the world in the treatment of diabetics, further
      long-term studies are needed to verify the efficacy of ginseng.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Gymnema sylvestre</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Gymnema sylvestre is also employed in traditional ayurverdic
      medicine. The plant grows in the tropical forests of southern and
      central India, and has been linked with significant blood glucose
      lowering. Some studies in animals have even reported regeneration
      of islet cells and an increase in beta-cell function.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Momordica charantia</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Momordica Charantia goes under a variety of names and is native to
      some areas of Asia, India, Africa and South America. Marketed as
      charantia, it is also known as karela or karolla and bitter melon.
      The herb may be prepared in a variety of different ways, and may
      be able to help diabetics with insulin secretion, glucose
      oxidation and other processes.<br>
      <br>
      Acute effects on blood glucose levels have also been reported.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Ocimum sanctum</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Ocimum sanctum is an herb employed in traditional ayurverdic
      practises, and is commonly known as holy basil. A controlled
      clinical trial showed a positive effect on postprandial and
      fasting glucose, and experts predict that the herb could enhance
      the functioning of beta cells, and facilitate the insulin
      secretion process.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Opuntia streptacantha</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Opuntia streptacantha (nopal) is commonly known as the
      prickly-pear cactus in the arid regions where it grows.<br>
      <br>
      Inhabitants of the Mexican desert have traditionally employed the
      plant in glucose control. Intestinal glucose uptake may be
      affected by some properties of the plant, and animal studies have
      found significant decreases in postprandial glucose and HbA1c.<br>
      <br>
      Once again, to validate the prickly-pear cactus as an effective
      means of aiding diabetic patients, long-term clinical trials are
      needed.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Silibum marianum</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Silibum marianum is also known as milk thistle, and is a member of
      the aster family. Silymarin contains high concentrations of
      flavinoids and antioxidants, some of which may have a beneficial
      effect on insulin resistance. The role of milk thistle in
      glycaemic control is little understood.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Trigonella foenum graecum</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Trigonella foenum graecum is known as fenugreek and is widely
      grown in India, North Africa, and parts of the Mediterranean.<br>
      <br>
      It is also a part of Ayurvedic treatment, and is used extensively
      in cooking.<br>
      <br>
      Of the few non-controlled trials that have been carried out on
      type 2 diabetics, most report improved glycaemic control. Further
      study is certainly warranted.<br>
      <br>
      Further herbs that have been studied, and may have positive
      effects for diabetic patients include:<br>
      <br>
      <b>Berberine… Cinnamomym tamala… Curry… Eugenia jambolana… Gingko…
        Phyllanthus amarus… Pterocarpus marsupium… Solanum torvum… Vinca

      </b><b>The Best Herbs and Supplements for Diabetes</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Gymnema Sylvestre</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Main use: Lowering blood sugar<br>
      Typical dosage: 200 to 250 milligrams twice daily.<br>
      <br>
      This plant’s Hindi name translates as “sugar destroyer,” and the
      plant is said to reduce the ability to detect sweetness. It’s
      regarded as one of the most powerful herbs for blood-sugar
      control. It may work by boosting the activity of enzymes that help
      cells use glucose or by stimulating the production of insulin.
      Though it hasn’t been studied ­extensively, it’s not known to
      cause serious side effects.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Bitter Melon</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Main use: Lowering blood sugar<br>
      Typical dosage: 50 to 100 milliliters (approximately 3 to 6
      tablespoons) of the juice daily.<br>
      <br>
      The aptly named bitter melon is thought to help cells use glucose
      more effectively and block sugar absorption in the intestine. When
      Philippine researchers had men and women take bitter melon in
      capsule form for three months, they had slight, but consistently,
      lower blood sugar than those taking a placebo. Gastrointestinal
      problems are possible side effects.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Magnesium</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Main use: Lowering blood sugar<br>
      Typical dosage: 250 to 350 milligrams once a day.<br>
      <br>
      Magnesium deficiency is not uncommon in people with diabetes, and
      it can worsen high blood sugar and insulin resistance. Some
      studies suggest that supplementing with magnesium may improve
      insulin function and lower blood sugar levels, but other studies
      have shown no benefit. Have your doctor check you for deficiency
      before supplementing with magnesium.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Prickly Pear Cactus</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Main use: Lowering blood sugar<br>
      Typical dosage: If you eat it as a food, aim for 1⁄2 cup of cooked
      cactus fruit a day. Otherwise, follow label directions.<br>
      <br>
      The ripe fruit of this cactus has been shown in some small studies
      to lower blood sugar ­levels. You may be able to find the fruit in
      your grocery store, but if not, look for it as a juice or powder
      at health food stores. Researchers speculate that the fruit may
      possibly lower blood sugar because it contains components that
      work similarly to insulin. The fruit is also high in fiber.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Gamma-Linolenic Acid </b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Main use: Easing nerve pain<br>
      Typical dosage: 270 to 540 milligrams once a day.<br>
      <br>
      Gamma-linolenic acid, or GLA, is a fatty acid found in evening
      primrose oil. Some research suggests that people with diabetes
      have lower than optimal levels of GLA, and studies have found that
      the supplement can reduce and ­prevent nerve pain associated with
      diabetes.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Chromium</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Main use: Lowering blood sugar<br>
      Typical dosage: 200 micrograms once daily.<br>
      <br>
      This trace mineral is thought to enhance the action of insulin as
      well as being involved in carbohydrate, fat, and protein
      metabolism. Some research shows that it helps normalize blood
      sugar — but only in people who are deficient in chromium.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Billberry</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Main use: Protecting the eyes and nerves<br>
      Typical dosage: 80 to 120 milligrams two times per day of
      standardized bilberry extract.<br>
      <br>
      This relative of the blueberry contains powerful antioxidants in
      its fruit and leaves. These anti­oxidants, called anthocyanidins,
      seem to help prevent damage to tiny blood vessels that can result
      in nerve pain and retinopathy (damage to the eye’s retina). Animal
      studies have also suggested that bilberry may lower blood sugar.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Alpha-Lipoic Acid</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Main uses: Easing nerve pain, lowering blood sugar<br>
      Typical dosage: 600 to 800 milligrams a day.<br>
      <br>
      Called ALA for short, this vitamin-like substance neutralizes many
      types of free radicals. A build-up of free radicals, caused in
      part by high blood sugar, can lead to nerve damage and other
      problems. ALA may also help muscle cells take up blood sugar. In a
      German study, a team of scientists had 40 adults take either an
      ALA supplement or a placebo. At the end of the four-week study,
      the ALA group had improved their insulin sensitivity 27 percent.
      The placebo group showed no improvement. Other studies have shown
      a decrease in nerve pain, numbness, and burning.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Fenugreek</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Main use: Lowering blood sugar<br>
      Typical dosage: 5 to 30 grams with each meal or 15 to 90 grams
      with one meal per day.<br>
      <br>
      These seeds, used in Indian cooking, have been found to lower
      blood sugar, increase insulin sensitivity, and reduce high
      cholesterol, according to several animal and human studies. The
      effect may be partly due to the seeds’ high fiber content. The
      seeds also contain an amino acid that appears to boost the release
      of insulin. In one of the largest studies on fenugreek, 60 people
      who took 25 grams daily showed significant improvements in blood
      sugar control and post-meal spikes.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Ginseng</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Main use: Lowering blood sugar<br>
      Typical dosage: 1 to 3 grams a day in capsule or tablet form, or 3
      to 5 milliliters of tincture three times a day.<br>
      <br>
      Known for its immune-boosting and disease-fighting benefits, this
      Chinese herb has several positive diabetes studies behind it.
      Re­searchers have found that ginseng slows carbohydrate
      absorption; increases cells’ ability to use glucose; and increases
      insulin secretion from the pancreas. A team from the University of
      Toronto has repeatedly demonstrated that ginseng capsules lower
      blood glucose 15 to 20 percent compared to placebo pills.<br>

      <div align="center"><b>Can This Herb Completely Replace Drugs for
          Type-2 Diabetics? </b><br>
        <br>
        <b>Dr. Frank Shallenberger</b><br>

      <b><br>
      </b><b>Berberis vulgaris (barberry)</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Berberine is a phytochemical (plant chemical) found in many
      different plants. When used in herbal medicine, the usual sources
      are barberry, goldenseal, or Oregon grape. It's the main alkaloid
      of Coptis chinensis, which Asian folk medicine uses to treat
      diabetes. You also may hear people refer to Coptis chinensis as
      Chinese Goldthread, Huang-Lian, and Huang-LienIt.<br>
      <br>
      Berberine has a lot of uses. It can treat heart disease, immune
      disorders, digestive problems, eye infections, and other
      infections. I had never heard of it being all that effective in
      diabetes. So as soon as Rich sent me that message, I looked into
      it. I found several well-written scientific articles describing an
      effect of berberine that I could hardly believe. It seems that you
      can use it as a substitute for insulin.<br>
      <br>
      One study, published just last year looked at the effect of
      berberine on how well muscle cells take in sugar. As you probably
      already know, except when we are actively exercising, sugar cannot
      get into muscle cells unless insulin is present to escort it in.
      That's why the blood sugar goes up when patients either don't have
      enough insulin, or when the insulin they do have doesn't work
      effectively, a condition called insulin resistance.<br>
      <br>
      In the study, the researchers exposed muscle cells from rats to
      berberine, and then examined what happened. What they discovered
      was amazing.<br>
      <br>
      The berberine solution had the same effect on the cells as
      insulin.<br>
      <br>
      Just like insulin, it activated the same biochemical pathway
      (protein kinase phosphorylation activation of GLUT-4) that signals
      cells to take up more sugar. And just like insulin, the greater
      the amount of berberine they exposed the cells to, the more sugar
      they took up. All this happened in the absence of any insulin!...<br>
      <br>
      <b>Better than metformin for diabetes</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Now I'd like to tell you about another study that proves this. In
      fact, this study shows that berberine might just be the best
      medication there is, natural or otherwise, for diabetes.<br>
      <br>
      This study looked at the effect of berberine on 36 patients. All
      of them were newly diagnosed cases of type-2 diabetes.<br>
      <br>
      Half of the patients took 500 mg, three times daily of the drug
      metformin (also known as Glucophage). The other half took
      berberine (berberine hydrochloride) in the same dose – 500 mg,
      three times a day. Then the researchers measured the participants'
      blood sugar levels for the next three months. Here's what
      happened: In terms of blood sugar control, both treatments worked
      equally as well. The fasting blood sugars went down 30%. And the
      sugar levels after eating (called the post prandial levels) went
      down even more – 45%.<br>
      <br>
      But here's the really astounding thing about berberine. All of
      this happened within the first two to four weeks of taking the
      treatment. And unlike metformin, there were no side effects at all
      in any of the patients taking berberine. In addition to the sugar
      levels, the A1c levels went down as well – a full 20%. That may
      not sound like a lot. But it's a very significant improvement.<br>

      …One herb touted for diabetes got a boost recently from a Canadian
      clinical trial. University of Toronto researcher Vladamir Vulksan,
      PhD, announced at the American Diabetes Association (ADA) annual
      meeting in June 2000 that he'd gotten some positive results using
      ginseng.<br>
      <br>
      In addition to their usual diabetes regimen -- a careful diet,
      regular exercise, and in some cases, medication -- 23 type 2
      diabetic patients took either 3 grams of American ginseng or a
      placebo each day for eight weeks, at which point they switched
      treatments. The diabetic patients' fasting blood sugar levels
      dropped about 9% more when they took ginseng compared with when
      they took the placebo; glycosylated hemoglobin levels between the
      two groups differed by 4%, with the ginseng group being lower.<br>

      <b>1. Fenugreek (Methi) :</b> Fenugreek seeds (trigonella foenum
      graecum) are high in soluble fibre, which help lower blood sugar
      by slowing down digestion and absorption of carbohydrates. Several
      clinical trials showed that fenugreek seeds can improve most
      metabolic symptoms associated with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes
      in humans by lowering blood glucose levels and improving glucose
      tolerance. It contains trigonelline, which is known to reduce
      blood sugar level. Take the seeds after soaking them in water
      overnight or powdered form with buttermilk.<br>
      <br>
      <b>2. Bitter Melon (Karela) :</b> The fruit contains at least
      three active substances with anti-diabetic properties, including
      charantin , vicine and an insulin-like compound known as
      polypeptide-p. Either these substances work individually or
      together to help reduce blood sugar levels. Bitter melon also
      contains a lectin that reduces blood glucose concentrations by
      acting on peripheral tissues and suppressing appetite - similar to
      the effects of insulin in the brain. This lectin is thought to be
      a major factor behind the hypoglycemic effect that develops after
      eating bitter melon. Karela is rich in vitamins a, b1, b2, c, iron
      and its regular use prevents complication associated with
      diabetics such as eye complications, neuritis and defective
      metabolism of carbohydrates.<br>
      <br>
      <b>3. Jambu fruit (jamun) :</b> Its seed contains jamboline, which
      controls the excessive conversion of starch to sugar. Seed powder
      can be used with water or buttermilk. It reduces the quantity of
      sugar in urine and allays the unquenchable thirst.<br>
      <br>
      <b>4. Bael leaves :</b> They are scientifically proved to be
      anti-diabetic. Drink fresh juice of leaves with pinch of pepper.<br>
      <br>
      <b>5. Garlic :</b> Allicin is having anti-diabetic effect.<br>
      <br>
      <b>6. Aloe Vera :</b> A well known liver tonic, its regular use
      tones up the hepatic-biliary system and regulates sugar &amp; fat.
      Preliminary research suggests that intake of aloe vera juice can
      help improve blood glucose levels and may therefore be useful in
      treating people with diabetes. Aloe also have following positive
      effects due to the presence of compounds such as lectins, mannans
      and anthraquinones.<br>
      <br>
      Decreased blood lipids (fats) in patients that have abnormally
      high levels of these molecules in their blood<br>
      <br>
      Decreased swelling and faster healing of wound injuries: Leg
      wounds and ulcers are common complications of diabetes, and they
      typically take longer time to heal than in healthy non-diabetic
      individuals.<br>
      <br>
      <b>7. Cabbage :</b> It is as effective as insulin.<br>
      <br>
      <b>8. Turmeric : </b>Its efficacy increases when effective with
      an equal amount of amla powder.<br>
      <br>
      <b>9. Cinnamon (Dalchini) :</b> Results from a clinical study
      published in the Diabetes Care journal in 2003 suggest that
      cinnamon bark improves blood glucose and cholesterol levels in
      people with type 2 diabetes, and may reduce risk factors
      associated with diabetes and cardiovascular disease.<br>
      <br>
      <b>10. Curry Patta : </b>Eating 10 fresh fully-grown curry leaves
      every morning for 3months is said to prevent diabetes.<br>
      <br>
      <b>11. Indian goose berry (Amala) :</b> One tsp of its juice mixed
      with a cup of fresh bitter gourd juice, taken daily for 2 months,
      stimulates islets of langerhans (a part of Pancreas) and enable
      persons to secrete natural insulin.<br>
      <br>
      <b>12. Isabgole :</b> It helps in controlling blood sugar in
      diabetics by inhibiting the excessive absorption of sugars from
      the intestines.<br>
      <br>
      <b>13. Beans :</b> Beans are high in carbohydrate and fiber and
      stimulates the production of insulin. It should be eaten liberally
      to keep diabetes under control.<br>
      <br>
      <b>14. Cucumber and Radish leaves :</b> These low a carbohydrate
      vegetables are beneficial in the prevention and control of
      diabetes.<br>
      <br>
      <b>15. Onion :</b> It has active hypoglycemic substances, r allyl
      propyl disulphide &amp; allicin.<br>
      <br>
      <b>16. Ginger :</b> It is rich in gingerols, that can increase
      uptake of glucose into muscle cells without using insulin, and may
      therefore assist in the management of high blood sugar levels. Two
      ginger extracts spissum and an oily extract interact with
      serotonin receptors to reveres their effect on insulin secretion.
      Treatment led to a 35% drop in blood glucose levels and a 10 per
      cent increase in plasma insulin levels.<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>OBJECTIVE</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      To conduct a systematic review of the published literature on the
      efficacy and safety of herbal therapies and vitamin/mineral
      supplements for glucose control in patients with diabetes.<br>
      <br>
      <b>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</b><br>
      <br>
      We conducted an electronic literature search of MEDLINE,
      OLDMEDLINE, Cochrane Library Database, and HealthSTAR, from
      database inception to May 2002, in addition to performing hand
      searches and consulting with experts in the field. Available
      clinical studies published in the English language that used human
      participants and examined glycemic control were included. Data
      were extracted in a standardized manner, and two independent
      investigators assessed methodological quality of randomized
      controlled trials using the Jadad scale.<br>
      <br>
      <b>RESULTS</b><br>
      <br>
      A total of 108 trials examining 36 herbs (single or in
      combination) and 9 vitamin/mineral supplements, involving 4,565
      patients with diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance, met the
      inclusion criteria and were analyzed. There were 58 controlled
      clinical trials involving individuals with diabetes or impaired
      glucose tolerance (42 randomized and 16 nonrandomized trials).
      Most studies involved patients with type 2 diabetes. Heterogeneity
      and the small number of studies per supplement precluded formal
      meta-analyses. Of these 58 trials, the direction of the evidence
      for improved glucose control was positive in 76% (44 of 58). Very
      few adverse effects were reported.<br>
      <br>
      <b>CONCLUSIONS</b><br>
      <br>
      There is still insufficient evidence to draw definitive
      conclusions about the efficacy of individual herbs and supplements
      for diabetes; however, they appear to be generally safe. The
      available data suggest that several supplements may warrant
      further study. The best evidence for efficacy from adequately
      designed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) is available for
      Coccinia indica and American ginseng. Chromium has been the most
      widely studied supplement. Other supplements with positive
      preliminary results include Gymnema sylvestre, Aloe vera,
      vanadium, Momordica charantia, and nopal…<br>
      <br>
      A total of 108 clinical studies were found examining 25 single
      herbs, 11 combination herb formulas, and 9 vitamin/mineral
      supplements as potential therapy for diabetes. Of these, 58 were
      controlled clinical trials in patients with diabetes or impaired
      glucose tolerance (42 randomized, 16 nonrandomized). Only four of
      the controlled trials included patients with type 1 diabetes
      (57–60). In addition, there were 12 trials examining glycemic
      parameters in healthy individuals. The remaining studies were 36
      uncontrolled prospective cohort trials and 2 case reports..<br>
      <br>
      <b>RESULTS</b><br>
      <br>
      Single herbs/plant derivatives for glycemic control<br>
      <br>
      Table 1 presents the controlled clinical trials of single herbs
      for glycemic control in patients with diabetes. Of the single
      herbs studied, the higher-quality RCTs (with Jadad scores of 3 or
      greater) are available for <b>Coccinia indica, ginseng species,
        Bauhinia forficata, and Myrcia uniflora.</b> One RCT for Allium
      sativum is also of adequate quality but was conducted in
      nondiabetic individuals. Other herbs, <b>Allium cepa, Ocimum
        sanctum, Ficus carica, Silibum marianum, Opuntia streptacantha,
        and Trigonella foenum</b>, have been studied in poorer-quality
      RCTs. <b>Gymnema sylvestre and Momordica charantia</b> have been
      studied in only nonrandomized controlled trials.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Coccinia indica</b><br>
      <br>
      Coccinia indica (ivy gourd) is a creeping plant that grows wildly
      in many parts of the India subcontinent, and is used to treat
      “sugar urine” (madhumeha) in Ayurveda, a traditional East Indian
      healing system. The mechanism of action of Coccinia indica is not
      well understood, but the herb appears to have insulin-mimetic
      properties (61–63).<br>
      <br>
      The one RCT of this herb (n = 32), conducted in India, reported
      significant changes in glycemic control following 6 weeks’ use of
      powder from locally obtained crushed dried leaves in poorly
      controlled or otherwise untreated patients with type 2 diabetes
      (64). Another three-arm controlled clinical trial (n = 70)
      compared 12 weeks’ use of dried herb pellets made from fresh
      leaves with no treatment and oral hypoglycemic agents
      (chlopropamide) in patients with type 2 diabetes (61). The
      magnitude of change seen with the herb was similar to that with a
      conventional drug. Two other open-label prospective trials offer
      supporting evidence of a hypoglycemic effect (62,63). No adverse
      events were reported in these trials. The preliminary evidence
      suggests that the potential role for Coccinia indica in diabetes
      warrants further study. (U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Level
      I, American Diabetes Association Guidelines Level A)<br>
      <br>
      <b>Ginseng species</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Several different plant species are often referred to as ginseng.
      These include Chinese or Korean ginseng (Panax ginseng), Siberian
      ginseng (Eleutherococcus senticosus), American ginseng (P.
      quiquefolius), and Japanese ginseng (P. japonicus). Panax species
      (from the root panacea) are often touted for their “cure-all”
      adaptogenic properties, immune-stimulant effects, and their
      ability to increase stamina, concentration, longevity, and overall
      well-being (37). Preparations use the herb’s root; some sources
      report greater efficacy with roots that are greater than 3 years
      old. Principal components are believed to be the triterpenoid
      saponin glycosides (ginsenosides or panaxosides). Hypoglycemic
      effects have been shown in streptozotocin rat models (65).
      Reported mechanisms of action include decreased rate of
      carbohydrate absorption into the portal hepatic circulation,
      increased glucose transport and uptake mediated by nitric oxide,
      increased glycogen storage, and modulation of insulin secretion
      (39).<br>
      <br>
      Most clinical trials we found utilized American ginseng, with many
      examining the herb’s short-term effects on patients with type 2
      diabetes after a standard oral GTT (66,67). Two longer-term trials
      administered American ginseng for 8 weeks (n = 36 and n = 24);
      both reported decreases in fasting blood glucose and HbA1c
      (68,69). Only one case of insomnia was reported in these trials.
      Three other short-term metabolic trials in healthy volunteers also
      found decreases in postprandial glucose (66,70,71). All but one of
      the clinical trials we examined were from the same investigator
      group. The available evidence for American ginseng in diabetes
      suggests a possible hypoglycemic effect; however, the trials are
      small and longer-term studies are needed. (Level I, A)<br>
      <br>
      <b>Allium species: sativum and cepa</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Allium sativum (garlic), a member of the lily family, is most
      commonly used worldwide for flavorful cooking. Much of the
      clinical literature on garlic has focused on its potential
      antioxidant activity and microcirculatory effects (e.g., allicin
      and ajoene for use in hypertension and hyperlipidemia). Few
      studies have examined its effects on insulin and glucose handling,
      although some attention has been given to allyl propyl disulfide,
      a volatile oil, and S-allyl-cysteine sulfoxide, a sulfur
      containing amino acid (39,72). Experiments in animal models with
      alloxan-induced diabetes have shown moderate reductions in blood
      glucose; no effect is seen in pancreatectomized animals (72,72).
      Allium cepum (onion) also contains allyl propyl disulphide and has
      similar purported hypoglycemic properties. Reported mechanisms of
      allium species include increased secretion or slowed degradation
      of insulin, increased glutathione peroxidase activity, and
      improved liver glycogen storage (39,41).<br>
      <br>
      The highest quality RCT of Allium sativum in humans was actually
      designed to examine thrombocyte aggregation in nondiabetic
      individuals (n = 60). However, the investigators found significant
      decreases in fasting serum glucose (74). The only available trial
      of garlic in patients with type 2 diabetes (n = 33) did not find
      consistent glucose or insulin responses after 1 month of
      supplementation (75). The only clinical trial available for Allium
      cepa is a small RCT of allyl propyl disulphide extract capsules
      from onion in nondiabetic volunteers (n = 6); investigators showed
      an acute decrease in fasting blood glucose and increase in
      insulin, supporting an insulin-mediated effect (76). No adverse
      events were reported in these trials. The limited data provide
      conflicting evidence for allium species in glycemic control.
      (Level I, C)<br>
      <br>
      <b>Ocimum sanctum</b><br>
      <br>
      Ocimum sanctum (holy basil) is another commonly used herb in
      Ayurveda (related species include Ocimum album and Ocimum
      basilicum). Studies in animal models suggest hypoglycemic effects
      (77), although the mechanism of action remains unknown. Postulated
      effects include enhanced β-cell function and insulin secretion.
      The one available controlled clinical trial of Ocimum sanctum (n =
      40) showed positive effects on both fasting and postprandial
      glucose in patients with type 2 diabetes using a local preparation
      of fresh leaf powder mixed in water for 4 weeks (78). No adverse
      effects were reported. Further information is needed before the
      efficacy of Ocimum sanctum in diabetes can be fully assessed.
      (Level III, C)<br>
      <br>
      <b>Trigonella foenum graecum</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Trigonella foenum graecum (fenugreek) is a legume extensively
      cultivated in India, North Africa, and the Mediterranean. It is a
      common condiment used in Indian cooking and commonly used herb in
      Ayurveda. Defatted seeds of fenugreek, which are rich in fiber,
      saponins, and protein, have been described in early Greek and
      Latin pharmacopoeias for hyperglycemia. Although the seed portion
      is often mentioned, other parts of the herb have also been
      investigated. Purported mechanisms include delay of gastric
      emptying, slowing carbohydrate absorption, and inhibition of
      glucose transport from the fiber content, as well as increased
      erythrocyte insulin receptors and modulation of peripheral glucose
      utilization. Many studies in alloxan-rat models have shown
      modulated exocrine pancreatic secretion (79).<br>
      <br>
      There are several trials available for fenugreek in type 2
      diabetes; however, most are noncontrolled (158). Of the available
      RCTs, they are generally poorer-quality studies with small numbers
      (n = 5–15) and from a single investigator group. Nonetheless,
      these trials, including a single trial in type 1 diabetes, have
      reported improved glycemic control using seed powder incorporated
      into unleavened bread (59,80). Another trial in healthy volunteers
      (n = 38) incorporated several short-term randomized crossover
      experiments administering different preparations of fenugreek
      before oral GTT. In these series of trials, whole raw seeds,
      extracted seed powder, gum isolate of seeds, and cooked whole
      seeds seemed to decrease postprandial glucose levels, whereas
      degummed seeds and cooked leaves did not (79). Other open-label
      prospective cohort studies have followed patients on fenugreek for
      up to 6 months with reported benefits in glycemic control
      (79,81–84). No adverse effects were reported in these trials.
      There is some preliminary evidence for the efficacy of fenugreek
      that suggests further studies may be warranted. (Level II-2, C)<br>
      <br>
      <b>Bauhinia forficata and Myrcia uniflora</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Indigenous to rainforests and tropical areas of South America,
      Bauhinia forficata has been used in traditional treatment of
      diabetes in that area. In Brazilian herbal medicine, Bauhinia
      species have been referred to as “vegetable insulin.” Another
      commonly used South American herb is Myrcia uniflora. As part of a
      national effort to identify potential plant species useful in
      glucose control, two small crossover studies (n = 16 and n = 18)
      by one investigator administered each of these herbs as tea
      infusions to separate groups of patients three times daily for 8
      weeks. No significant differences in glucose or HbA1c were
      detected between study herb infusion and a placebo tea using
      Imperata brasiliensis. No adverse effects were reported (85). This
      limited preliminary evidence does not support the hypoglycemic
      effect of these two plant species. (Level I, American Diabetes
      Association level not applicable if no studies show benefit)<br>
      <br>
      <b>Ficus carica</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Ficus carica (fig leaf) is a popular plant used for patients with
      diabetes in Spain and other areas in Southwestern Europe. Its
      active component is unknown. Several studies in animal models with
      diabetes have shown both short- and long-term hypoglycemic
      effects, although human trials are lacking. Potential hypolipdemic
      effects in diabetic rats have also been shown (86–88). Its
      mechanism for glucose effect is unknown; however, some studies
      suggest facilitation of glucose uptake peripherally. The one
      available clinical trial is a small crossover study of fig leaf
      tea for 4 weeks in patients with type 1 diabetes (n = 10);
      investigators showed a decrease in postprandial glucose and
      insulin requirements, but no change in fasting glucose when
      compared with the control commercial tea (60). No effect was seen
      in C-peptide levels, thereby supporting a non-insulin-mediated
      effect. No adverse effects were reported. Clearly, more
      information is needed before the efficacy of Ficus carica can be
      properly assessed. (Level III, C)<br>
      <br>
      <b>Opuntia streptacantha</b><br>
      <br>
      Opuntia streptacantha (nopal) or the prickly pear cactus can be
      found in arid regions throughout the Western hemisphere, including
      the southwestern U.S., and is commonly used for glucose control by
      those of Mexican descent. It has a high-soluble fiber and pectin
      content, which may affect intestinal glucose uptake, partially
      accounting for its hypoglycemic actions (65). Animal models have
      reported decreases in postprandial glucose and HbA1c with
      synergistic effects with insulin. Studies in pancreatectomized
      animals report that hypoglycemic activity is not dependent on the
      presence of insulin (89). Most human studies of nopal have been
      published in Spanish and, thus, are not included in this review.
      We found only two controlled short-term metabolic trials (n = 14
      and n = 32) published in the English language, both by the same
      investigator (90,91). These reported improvements in patients with
      type 2 diabetes with decreased fasting glucose and decreased
      insulin levels, suggesting enhanced insulin sensitivity. No side
      effects were reported in these trials. The limited data suggests a
      possible hypoglycemic effect of nopal; however, longer-term
      clinical trials are needed. (Level III, C)<br>
      <br>
      <b>Silibum marianum</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Silibum marianum (milk thistle), a member of the aster family, has
      been primarily studied for its purported effects on alcoholic and
      viral hepatitis, rather than for glycemic control. However,
      silymarin is rich in flavonoids, potent antioxidants, and some
      have postulated a potential benefit for those who have insulin
      resistance secondary to hepatic damage (39). Mechanisms are based
      on the herb’s antioxidant activity and effects on hepatocyte
      stabilization with decreased glutathione oxidation, as well as on
      restoration of normal malondialdehyde concentrations.<br>
      <br>
      The one available clinical trial examined cirrhotic patients with
      type 2 diabetes (n = 60) using a commercially available
      preparation (“Legalon” 600 mg/day; IBI Lorenzini, Milan, Italy)
      for 12 months, with significant improvements in glycemic control
      when compared with no treatment (92). No adverse effects were
      reported. Further information and higher quality clinical trials
      are needed to further investigate milk thistle in glycemic
      control. (Level III, C)<br>
      <br>
      <b>Gymnema sylvestre</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Gymnema sylvestre is another commonly used herb in Ayurveda. The
      plant is a woody climber that grows in tropical forests of central
      and southern India. According to common folklore, chewing the
      leaves causes a loss of sweet taste, hence the popular Hindi name
      of the plant “gurmar,” meaning “destroyer of sugar.” Early animal
      studies reported blood glucose-lowering effects in animals with
      residual pancreatic function, but no effect in total
      pancreatectomized animals. Studies of an ethanol leaf extract,
      GS4, in diabetic rat and rabbit models have reported regeneration
      of islets of Langerhans, decreases in blood glucose, and increases
      of serum insulin (58). Mechanism of action is unknown; postulated
      theories include an increase in glucose uptake and utilization,
      increase in insulin release through cell permeability, increase in
      β-cell number, and stimulation of β-cell function (39,93).<br>
      <br>
      Two nonrandomized controlled clinical trials are available, both
      from the same investigator group. Groups of patients with type 1
      diabetes (n = 64) and type 2 diabetes (n = 47) showed improved
      glycemic control with chronic adjunctive use of GS4 extract
      compared with those who received conventional treatment alone
      (58,94). The evidence for the beneficial effect of Gymnema
      sylvestre in diabetes is suggestive, although inconclusive given
      the limited data. (Level II-1, C)<br>

      <b>Momordica charantia</b><br>
      <br>
      Momordica charantia is a vegetable indigenous to tropical areas,
      including India, Asia, South America, and Africa, also known as
      balsam pear, karela (karolla), and bitter melon. Reported
      preparations of the herb range from injectable extracts to fruit
      juice to fried melon bits (39,95–97). Active components are
      thought to be charantin, vicine, and polypeptide-p (an
      unidentified insulin-like protein similar to bovine insulin).
      Theoretical mechanisms include increased insulin secretion, tissue
      glucose uptake, liver muscle glycogen synthesis, glucose
      oxidation, and decreased hepatic gluconeogenesis. Studies in
      alloxan-induced diabetic rabbits have suggested hypoglycemic
      effects (98).<br>
      <br>
      Two controlled short-term metabolic trials in patients with type 2
      diabetes (n = 18 and n = 9) have reported acute effects on blood
      glucose with Momordica charantia fruit juice, as well as
      subcutaneous vegetable insulin extract (95,99). Two other small,
      uncontrolled open-label trials also reported positive effects on
      glycemic control after longer-term use (7–11 weeks) (96,97). No
      adverse effects were reported in these trials. Some, albeit
      limited, data suggest a potential effect of Momordica charantia in
      diabetes. However, further information in RCTs is needed. (Level
      III, C)<br>
      <br>
      <b>Aloe vera</b><br>
      <br>
      Aloe vera is the most well-known species of aloe, a desert plant
      resembling the cactus in the Liliaceae family. It is popularly
      used to treat burns and promote wound healing. The dried sap of
      the Aloe vera is a traditional remedy for diabetes in the Arabian
      peninsula (33), although aloe gel is preferred over the sap as the
      latter contains the laxative anthraquinone (100). Aloe gel,
      obtained from the inner portion of the leaves, contains
      glucomannan, a hydrosoluble fiber which may in part account for
      its hypoglycemic effects (39). Reports in animal models have been
      inconsistent (100–103). Two nonrandomized clinical trials (n = 40
      and n = 76) are available from the same investigator group that
      reported improved fasting blood glucose with 6 weeks of juice made
      from aloe gel (100,104). Case reports of five type 2 diabetic
      individuals reported decreases in fasting blood glucose as well as
      HbA1c (101). No adverse effects were reported in these trials. The
      preliminary data suggest a potential effect of Aloe vera in
      glycemic control; however, further information is needed. (Level
      II-1, C)<br>

      Other herbs that have been studied solely in uncontrolled trials

      Eugenia jambolana (108), gingko (109), Phyllanthus amarus (110),
      Pterocarpus marsupium (111), Solanum torvum (112), and Vinca rosea

      <b>Combination formulas in Native American medicine</b><br>
      <br>
      Native American medicine refers to the healing practices from the
      people indigenous to North America; the approach combines
      awareness of mind, body, and spirit and ritualistic observances
      with practices of herbalism. One clinical trial (n = 40)
      specifically examined an herbal tea preparation containing<b>
        Populus tremuloides (trembling aspen) and Heracleum lanatum (cow
        parsnip)</b> prescribed by an Alexis band Sioux healer (117).
      Investigators reported no glycemic benefit over a control tea
      containing mint and fennel seed. Little is known scientifically
      about this formula, and it has not been studied elsewhere. The
      limited evidence for this Native American herb preparation does
      not support its use in glycemic control. (Level I, American
      Diabetes Association level not applicable if studies show no
      benefit)…<br>
      <br>
      <b>Vitamins/trace elements/dietary supplements for glycemic
        control</b><br>
      <br>
      Table 3 presents the controlled clinical trials of vitamin/mineral
      supplements for glycemic control in patients with diabetes. Of the
      studies examining vitamin and mineral supplements for glycemic
      control, the higher-quality RCTs (with Jadad scores of 3 or
      greater) are available for <b>chromium, magnesium, vitamin E, and
        l-carnitine</b> (126–137). <b>Vanadium</b> has been studied in
      only nonrandomized controlled trials (138–140).<br>
      <br>
      <b>Chromium species</b><br>
      <br>
      Chromium (Cr3), a trace element in its trivalent form, is required
      for the maintenance of normal glucose metabolism. Experimentally,
      chromium deficiency is associated with impaired glucose tolerance,
      which can be improved with supplementation (35). Most individuals
      with diabetes, however, are not chromium deficient. In addition to
      glucose control, the supplement has been studied for its effects
      on weight control, lipids, and bone density. Its action is linked
      with glucose tolerance factor (GTF), and has been shown to
      increase the number of insulin receptors, to enhance receptor
      binding, and to potentiate insulin action. Some suggest that
      chromium picolinate is the preferred form because it is utilized
      more efficiently (141).<br>
      <br>
      Of the eight RCTs examining chromium in those with diabetes or
      impaired glucose tolerance, preparations differ and the results
      are mixed. Among the larger trials, one using organic chromium in
      brewer’s yeast (n = 78) and another using chromium chloride (n =
      180) reported decreases in fasting and postprandial glucose
      (127,128). However, another trial by Anderson (n = 110) utilizing
      chromium pidolate did not find changes in glycemic control (142).
      One large noncontrolled open-label trial of chromium picolinate
      followed 833 type 2 diabetic patients in China for up to 10
      months. Investigators reported a decrease in fasting and
      postprandial glucose and a decrease in fatigue, excessive thirst,
      and frequent urination (143). These studies all reported no
      adverse effects. A recent meta-analysis by Althuis et al. (144)
      that included 15 RCTs (only 4 included diabetic individuals)
      reported that chromium had no effect on glucose or insulin
      concentrations in nondiabetic subjects; however, the data among
      patients with diabetes were inconclusive. Althuis et al. also
      suggested that more trials should be performed in North America,
      as the generalizabiltiy of trials conducted in China is unknown
      given regional differences in diet and nutritional status. (Level
      I, C)<br>
      <br>
      <b>Magnesium</b><br>
      <br>
      Hypomagnesemia is common in patients with diabetes, especially
      those with glycosuria, ketoacidosis, and excess urinary magnesium
      losses. Deficiency of magnesium can potentially cause states of
      insulin resistance. Studies have examined magnesium’s potential
      role in the evolution of such complications as neuropathy,
      retinopathy, thrombosis, and hypertension. However, its role in
      glycemic control is unknown. Magnesium is a cofactor in various
      enzyme pathways involved in glucose oxidation, and it modulates
      glucose transport across cell membranes. It may increase insulin
      secretion and/or improve insulin sensitivity and peripheral
      glucose uptake. It has been shown to have no effect on hepatic
      glucose output and nonoxidative glucose disposal (35,40). Because
      it is an intracellular cation, it is difficult to measure
      accurately, and total body stores are seldom measured.<br>
      <br>
      Of the seven RCTs examining magnesium supplementation for glycemic
      control in diabetes, only two small lower-quality trials from one
      investigator group (n = 8 and n = 9) reported a decrease in
      fasting plasma glucose and increase in postprandial insulin
      (145,146). Of the three highest-quality trials (Jadad score of 3),
      magnesium did not change blood glucose or HbA1c (130–132). One
      trial (n = 128) did find a decrease in serum fructosamine, a
      short-term marker of glycemic control. Another study (n = 40)
      reported one subject with an exanthem and one who had transient
      gastrointestinal pain with magnesium supplementation.
      (Interestingly, the trial by Eriksson and Kohvakka [132] contained
      a study arm that administered vitamin C supplements, which unlike
      magnesium, did show improvements in glycemic control. To our
      knowledge, this is the only report of vitamin C for glucose
      control.) The available data for magnesium are mixed, and thus the
      evidence for efficacy in diabetes is inconclusive. (Level I, C)<br>
      <br>
      <b>Vitamin E</b><br>
      <br>
      Diabetes produces a state of increased free radical activity. The
      purported effects of vitamin E on glucose control relate to the
      vitamin’s potent lipophilic antioxidant activity, with possible
      influences on protein glycation, lipid oxidation, and insulin
      sensitivity and secretion. Through unknown mechanisms, it may also
      affect nonoxidative glucose metabolism (35,40).<br>
      <br>
      Of the controlled trials that examined vitamin E for glucose
      control, the direction of the evidence for patients with type 2
      diabetes is positive in four of six, with doses ranging from 100
      to 1,600 mg/day for 2–4 months’ supplementation. The largest of
      these trials (n = 53), however, was a double-blind
      placebo-controlled crossover trial that found no change in serum
      glucose, fructosamine, or HbA1c (136). One clinical trial examined
      patients with type 1 diabetes (n = 35) and reported decreases in
      protein glycosylation after 3 months of low-dose 100 IU/day
      vitamin E (57). Thus far, the available evidence for vitamin E in
      glycemic control is mixed and inconclusive. (Level I, C)<br>
      <br>
      <b>l-Carnitine</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Several in vitro studies have helped to elucidate l-carnitine’s
      role in metabolism, suggesting that it acts as a modulator of fuel
      substrate utilization in cells, influencing free fatty acid and
      glucose oxidation. Few have examined it clinically in patients
      with diabetes. Three small controlled short-term metabolic trials
      examined the acute effects in type 2 diabetes (n = 18, n = 15, and
      n = 9), showing that intravenous carnitine (or its derivative
      acetyl-l-carnitine) administration can possibly effect insulin
      sensitivity and enhance glucose uptake and storage (137,147,148).
      There are no longer-term clinical studies of l-carnitine for
      glucose control and no studies of orally administered
      preparations. Thus, the available data are limited, and no
      conclusions can be made regarding its possible use in diabetes
      management. (Level I, A)<br>
      <br>
      <b>Vanadium</b><br>
      <br>
      Vanadium has been described as either a nonessential nutrient or a
      nutrient that is required only in minute quantities, as no
      physiological role of the trace element has yet to be found
      (35,149). Human deficiency has not been documented. There are no
      accurate assays in clinical settings, and there is no recommended
      daily allowance. Vanadium exists in several valence forms, with
      vanadyl (+5) sulfate and sodium metavanadate (+4) being the most
      common supplement forms. Its mechanism of action in glycemic
      control is thought to be primarily insulin-mimetic with
      upregulation of insulin receptors. In animal models, it has been
      shown to facilitate glucose uptake and metabolism and to enhance
      insulin sensitivity. Clinically, it may enhance glucose oxidation
      and glycogen synthesis, and it may modulate hepatic glucose output
      (35). Three very small controlled clinical trials (n = 6–8) have
      reported decreased fasting blood glucose (138–140); two of these
      trials also reported significant changes in HbA1c and insulin
      sensitivity (138,139). Two noncontrolled open-label studies, also
      with small sample sizes, nonetheless offer supporting evidence
      (150,151). Goldfine et al. (151) included type 1 diabetic patients
      (n = 5) who decreased their insulin requirements after 2 weeks of
      treatment. Gastrointestinal discomfort, including diarrhea,
      nausea, and flatulence, was reported by a large proportion of
      patients in all the vanadium trials. Organically chelated
      compounds, however, are thought to cause less gastrointestinal
      irritation than vanadium salts (149). The evidence for efficacy of
      vanadium in glucose control is suggestive, but as yet no RCTs are
      available. (Level II-1, C).<br>
      <br>
      <b>α-Lipoic acid</b><br>
      <br>
      Also known as thioctic acid, a disulfide compound synthesized in
      the liver, α-lipoic acid is a potent lipophilic antioxidant. It is
      a cofactor in many multienzyme complexes and may also play a role
      in glucose oxidation (152). Experimental in vitro data have shown
      possible effects in enhancing glucose uptake in muscle and
      preventing glucose-induced protein modifications. One
      multiple-dosage controlled trial is available in patients with
      type 2 diabetes (n = 74), and it reported positive effects on
      glucose uptake and insulin sensitivity with 600–1,800 mg/day
      α-lipoic acid for 4 weeks; however, the trial showed no changes in
      fasting blood glucose (153). Another noncontrolled trial offers
      supportive evidence for a change in insulin sensitivity (152). The
      available data are limited and suggest that further elucidation of
      α-lipoic acids actions is needed. (Level II-3, C)…<br>
      <br>
      A total of 108 human trials of herbs and vitamin/mineral
      supplements for glycemic control were obtained. Most trials
      examined supplements as an adjunct to conventional treatment with
      diet and/or medication. Of the available trials, 58 were
      controlled (42 RCTs) and conducted specifically in individuals
      with diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance. Among these
      controlled trials, statistically significant treatment effects
      were reported in 88% (23 of 26) of those examining single herbs,
      60% (3 of 5) of those examining combination herbs, and 67% (18 of
      27) of those examining vitamin and mineral supplements. However,
      many trials were of poor quality. More than half of the RCTs (24
      of 42, 57%) scored 2 or less on the Jadad scale. (No RCT achieved
      a score of 5.) Thirteen trials had sample sizes of 10 or fewer
      patients. In addition, there were generally few trials per
      supplement, making it difficult to draw definitive conclusions
      regarding efficacy. Nevertheless, no major safety concerns were
      reported in these trials. Few mild adverse effects, mainly
      gastrointestinal irritation, were reported for ginseng, Native
      American herb tea, TCM pill, magnesium, and vanadium (see Tables).
      For the following supplements, &gt;50% of controlled clinical
      trials (at least two trials) suggested efficacy: Coccinia indica,
      Trigonella foenum, American ginseng, nopal, Gymnema sylvestre,
      Aloe vera, Momordica charantia, chromium, and vanadium. Of these,
      the best evidence is available for Coccinia indica and American
      ginseng. Supplements that appear effective but have only been
      studied in nonrandomized trials include Gymnema sylvestre, Aloe
      vera, and vanadium. Supplements that appear to be effective in
      short-term metabolic trials include Momordica, nopal, and
      l-carnitine…<br>
