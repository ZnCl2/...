        <p><b><font size="+1">Radioactive Waste Recycling No Longer A
              Pain In The Ash</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p><i>ScienceDaily (Aug. 22, 2008)</i> — A new recycling plant
        will soon recover uranium from the ashes of radioactive garbage
        to be recycled back into nuclear fuel using an efficient,
        environmentally friendly technology inspired by decaffeinated
        coffee. The technique’s future may even hold the key to
        recycling the most dangerous forms of radioactive waste. </p>
      <p>Over the course of 20 years, <b>Chien Wai</b>, a University of
        Idaho chemistry professor, has developed a process that uses
        supercritical fluids to dissolve toxic metals. When coupled with
        a purifying process developed in partnership with Sydney
        Koegler, an engineer with nuclear industry leader AREVA and
        University of Idaho alumnus, enriched uranium can be recovered
        from the ashes of contaminated materials. On Wednesday, Aug. 20,
        representatives from the company and the university will sign an
        agreement to share the technologies and pave the way for the
        recycling plant’s construction. </p>
      <p>“Radioactive waste is a big problem facing the United States
        and the entire world,” said Wai. “We need new, innovative
        technology, and I think supercritical fluid is one such
        technology that will play an important role in the very near
        future.” </p>
      <p>A supercritical fluid — in this case carbon dioxide — is any
        substance raised to a temperature and pressure at which it
        exhibits properties of both a gas and a liquid. When
        supercritical, the substance can move directly into a solid like
        a gas and yet dissolve compounds like a liquid. For example,
        says Wai, supercritical carbon dioxide has directly dissolved
        and removed caffeine from whole coffee beans for decades. </p>
      <p>When the carbon dioxide’s pressure is returned to normal, it
        becomes a gas and evaporates, leaving behind only the extracted
        metals. No solvents required, no acids applied, and no organic
        waste left behind. </p>
      <p>“That’s why decaffeinated coffee tastes so good,” said Wai,
        while chuckling at the beauty and simplicity of the process.
        “There is no solvent used, and so no solvent left behind.” </p>
      <p>Because the technology is so simple, cost-effective and
        environmentally friendly, AREVA is eager to test its first
        full-scale use on 32 tons of incinerator ash in Richland, Wash.
      </p>
      <p>The existing plant in Richland fabricates fuel for commercial
        nuclear power plants from raw enriched uranium supplied by
        utility customers as uranium hexafluoride (UF6). During normal
        operation, common items including filters, rags, paper wipes,
        and gloves become contaminated with uranium. The waste is burned
        to reduce its volume and increase its uranium content, making it
        easier to recover the uranium. </p>
      <p>Nearly 10 percent of the ash’s weight is usable enriched
        uranium, worth about $900 dollars per pound on today’s market.
        This means about $5 million dollars is currently sitting in the
        garbage waiting to be recovered. The process may even become the
        basis of the next generation of plants designed to recover
        useful materials from spent fuel. </p>
      <p>“This agreement and technology is something Idaho should be
        very proud of,” said Wai of the supercritical fluid technology
        transfer. “We have developed something special. And to me, that
        something is important to Idaho and to the U.S., particularly as
        we look for alternate energy sources in the future.” </p>
      <p>The new recycling plant is expected to be operational in 2009
        and will take about a year to process AREVA’s ash inventory.
        When finished, much of its operating time can be devoted to ash
        received from other sites. </p>
      <p>The technology licensing agreement that will be signed by the
        university and AREVA will allow AREVA to use several of Wai’s
        discoveries to extract the metals from the ash. AREVA provided
        funding and will gain rights to the University of Idaho’s share
        of a joint University of Idaho and AREVA patent developed in
        cooperation with Wai over the past four years that further
        separates the enriched uranium from the extracted metals. </p>
      <p>“This process has been extremely collaborative — it’s one of
        those that you just love,” said Gene Merrell, the university’s
        chief technology transfer officer and assistant vice president
        for research. “It’s going to be a great deal that will benefit
        the University of Idaho, AREVA and the entire world.” </p>
      <p>Technology transfer is a process common to research
        universities. Rights to patents are sold to companies, or used
        to create new start-up companies, and benefit all parties
        involved. Not only do the technology’s profits benefit the
        university and future research, it allows the university to
        ensure its technology is being used in a useful and efficient
        way. </p>
      <p>But for Wai, this technology transfer is only the beginning. He
        is now working to make the technology even more environmentally
        friendly and also to recycle different forms of radioactive
        waste. </p>
      <p>The key to Wai’s research is to find a soluble chemical
        compound to bind with the uranium. Because carbon dioxide cannot
        directly dissolve metals such as uranium, a binding agent called
        a ligand is introduced to the equation. Once the ligand is
        applied, the supercritical carbon dioxide flows through the
        waste, dissolving both the ligand and the metals bounded to it.
        Dissolving and extracting any desired metal — possibly even
        radioactive material from high-level radioactive waste — simply
        requires finding a binding agent that works. Wai predicts
        supercritical fluids will be used in the not-too-distant-future
        to recycle even higher levels of radioactive waste. </p>
      <p>“To me, accomplishing that is important to Idaho and to the
        United States, particularly as we look for alternate energy
        sources in the future.” said Wai. “I believe nuclear energy will
        play a very large role, and that it can be done in a very
        environmentally safe and sustainable way.” </p>

        <p><b>&nbsp;By Matt Loveless</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>MOSCOW- It's being called a sustainable way to take care of
        nuclear waste and we might have to thank the person who came up
        with decaf coffee. </p>
      <p>It's a culmination of 20 years of work for UI Chemistry
        Professor Chien Wai. In collaboration with AREVA, a company
        involved in sustainable nuclear power, Wai developed a way to
        reuse uranium from the ashes of radioactive garbage currently
        sitting in Richland, Washington. </p>
      <p>"This is the first industrial demonstration of a green
        technology for treating nuclear waste in a profitable way," Wai
        said at an agreement signing ceremony with AREVA Wednesday. </p>
      <p>In simple terms, Wai came up with a substance that can extract
        the toxic metal, the same way caffeine has been taken out of
        whole coffee beans for decades. </p>
      <p>That uranium can be recycled, and turned over for quite the
        profit. </p>
      <p>"Out of this 30 tons, they can recover approximately $6 million
        of enriched uranium," said Wai. "This amount of money is enough
        to build a plant for this new process." </p>
      <p>The agreement, which was signed on the UI campus, moves forward
        plans for a recycling plant in Richland. Wai thinks getting
        millions of dollars out of a pile of garbage, among other
        things, will show the public nuclear energy is getting about as
        green as you can get. </p>
      <p>"I'm very sure this will have a positive impact on public
        opinion and make nuclear energy more acceptable to this
        country," said Wai. </p>

              Reactor Ash</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>Areva and the University of Idaho have signed an agreement to
        develop technology for recovering uranium from incinerator ash
        at Areva's uranium fuel plant in Richland, Washington state. The
        process also reduces the amount of ash classified as radioactive
        waste. </p>
      <p>Chien Wai, a chemistry professor at the University of Idaho,
        has developed a process that uses supercritical fluids to
        dissolve toxic metals. When this process is coupled with a
        purifying process developed in partnership with Sydney Koegler,
        an engineer with Areva and former student at the University of
        Idaho, enriched uranium can be recovered from the ashes of
        contaminated materials. </p>
      <p>A supercritical fluid - in this case carbon dioxide (CO2) - is
        any substance raised to a temperature and pressure at which it
        exhibits properties of both a gas and a liquid. When
        supercritical, the substance can move directly into a solid like
        a gas, yet dissolve compounds like a liquid. CO2 reaches its
        supercritical state at a pressure of about 6.9 MPa and a
        temperature of 31°C. When the fluid's pressure is returned to
        normal, it becomes a gas and evaporates, leaving behind only the
        extracted compounds. Wai commented that supercritical CO2 has
        been used for decades to remove caffeine from whole coffee
        beans. </p>
      <p>Areva plans to apply the process to recover uranium from 32
        tonnes of ash at its Richland nuclear fuel plant. In addition to
        the recovery of two tonnes of uranium, the radiotoxicity of the
        post-process ash is reduced, thereby allowing some to be
        reclassified as other than low-level waste (LLW). </p>
      <p>Construction of the ash-uranium recovery plant will begin in
        2008 and should be operational in 2009. It will take about one
        year to process the 32 tonnes of ash at Richland, after which
        the plant could process ash from other LLW generators in the
        nuclear energy and nuclear medicine industries. </p>

      <p><b>Abstract --&nbsp; </b>In order to investigate the
        effectiveness of ligand-assisted supercritical fluid extraction
        for the removal of transuranic contamination from soils an TNEEL
        silty-clay soil sample wasobtained from near the 13WMC area and
        subjected to three different chemical preparations before being
        spiked with plutonium. The spiked INEEL soil samples were
        subjected to a sequential aqueous extraction procedure to
        determine ‘radionuclide partitioning in each sample. Results
        from those extractions demonstrate that plutonium consistently
        partitioned into the residual fraction across all three INEEL
        soil preparations whereas americium partitioned 73% into the
        irordmanganese fraction for soil preparation A, with the balance
        partitioning into the residual fraction., Americium partitioned
        80% into the iron/manganese fraction for soil reparation B, with
        10% partitioning into the organic fraction and the balance
        partitioning into the residual fraction. Americium partitioned
        77% into the iron/manganese fraction for soil preparation C,
        with 22% in the organic phase and the balance in the carbonate
        fraction. Plutonium and americium were extracted from the INEEL
        soil samples using a Jigand-assisted supercritical fluid
        extraction technique. ‘ Initial supercritical fluid extraction-
        runs produced plutonium extraction efficiencies ranging from
        14°A to 19Y0. After a second round wherein the initial
        extraction parameters were changed, the plutonium extraction
        efficiencies increased to 60% and as high as 80% with the
        americium level in the post-extracted soil samples dropping near
        to the detection limits. The third round of experiments are
        currently underway. These results demonstrate that the

        effectively extract plutonium from the spiked IN EEL soil
        preparations </p>

      <p><b>Description</b> </p>
      <p><b>&nbsp;FIELD</b> </p>
      <p>[0002]This disclosure concerns a method and system for
        recovering metals, such as uranium, from metal-containing
        materials, particularly by extraction in a liquid or
        supercritical-fluid solvent. </p>
      <p><b>BACKGROUND</b> </p>
      <p>[0003]A broad range of industrial processes require the
        separation and recovery of metal from metal-containing material.
        Of particular importance is the separation and recovery of
        uranium from uranium-containing material. Uranium-containing
        material is generated as a byproduct of numerous processes,
        mostly associated with the nuclear power industry. Two examples
        of waste materials that contain significant quantities of
        uranium are spent nuclear fuel and incinerator ash from
        facilities that make nuclear fuel. Due to its toxicity and
        potential value, recovery of uranium from these and other waste
        materials is desirable. </p>
      <p>[0004]The PUREX (Plutonium and Uranium Recovery by Extraction)
        process currently is the most commonly used process for
        separating uranium from uranium-containing material. By this
        process, the uranium-containing material first is dissolved in
        nitric acid to form a uranyl nitrate solution. The uranium in
        this solution then is separated by an organic solvent, such as
        tributylphosphate (TBP) mixed with a diluent, such as dodecane.
        Subsequent liquid-liquid extractions further purify the uranium.
      </p>
      <p>[0005]The primary drawbacks of the PUREX process are cost and
        waste generation. The PUREX process, for example, involves
        numerous liquid-liquid extractions, which increase the cost of
        the process and increase the amount of liquid waste. The nitric
        acid dissolution step generates gaseous oxides of nitrogen that
        must be scrubbed from the off gas. This scrubbing step generates
        additional dilute nitric acid liquid waste. In addition, residue
        left over after the nitric acid dissolution step often contains
        residual nitric acid and requires treatment before disposal. </p>
      <p>[0006]The environmental and economic costs of the PUREX process
        vary depending on the concentration of uranium in the starting
        material. When nitric acid is used to dissolve materials with
        high concentrations of uranium, such as spent nuclear fuel rods,
        the resulting uranyl nitrate solution is relatively
        concentrated. In contrast, when nitric acid is used to dissolve
        materials with lower concentrations of uranium, such as
        incinerator ash, the resulting uranyl nitrate solution is less
        concentrated. More extensive liquid-liquid extraction is
        required to separate uranium from low-concentration uranyl
        nitrate solutions than is required to separate uranium from
        high-concentration uranyl nitrate solutions. Unfortunately,
        known processes to concentrate the uranyl nitrate solution
        before solvent extraction are not practical. </p>
      <p>[0007]There is a need to recover uranium and other metals from
        metal-containing materials at a lower cost and with less waste
        generation. This need is especially strong for the recovery of
        uranium from starting materials with low-to-moderate
        concentrations of uranium. Incinerator ash is one example of
        such a material. Factories that use uranium typically incinerate
        all of their combustible waste after it has been contaminated by
        uranium. This combustible waste can include, for example,
        packaging, protective suits and filters. The ash left over after
        burning this waste can contain various concentrations of uranium
        depending on factors such as the level of contamination and the
        presence of non-combustible contaminants other than uranium.
        Incinerator ash from facilities that manufacture nuclear fuel
        typically contains from about 5% to about 30% uranium.
        Currently, there are vast stockpiles of uranium-containing
        incinerator ash waiting for treatment or disposal and more is
        produced every day. Alternatives to the PUREX process are
        desperately needed. </p>
      <p>[0008]Extraction with carbon dioxide maintained in liquid or
        supercritical form by the application of high pressure has been

      <p>[0009]The inventors of the present disclosure recognized a need
        for methods and systems specially designed for the practical
        application of cleaner and more efficient extraction technology
        to the recovery of metals, such as uranium, from
        metal-containing materials. </p>
      <p><b>SUMMARY</b> </p>
      <p>[0010]Described herein are a method and a system for recovering
        a metal from a metal-containing material. The method can include
        an extraction step, during which the metal-containing material
        is exposed to an extractant to form an extract. The extractant
        can include a liquid or supercritical-fluid solvent and an
        acid-base complex including an oxidizing agent and a complexing
        agent. Upon exposure to the extractant, the metal forms a
        metal-containing complex with the complexing agent. The
        metal-containing complex is soluble in the solvent. After the
        extraction step, the metal can be separated from the extract in
        a stripping step. In the stripping step, the extract, which
        includes the metal-containing complex, is exposed to a stripping
        agent while the solvent is still in liquid or supercritical
        form. The metal migrates from the phase including the complexing
        agent into the stripping agent. After the stripping step, the
        stripping agent becomes a strip product and the extract becomes
        a raffinate. </p>
      <p>[0011]The overall method can be substantially continuous.
        Certain steps, however, can be batch or semi-batch processes.
        For example, the extraction step can be a multi-stage,
        semi-batch process. The metal-containing material can be exposed
        to the extractant in a countercurrent extraction process to form
        the extract and a residue. After being depleted of the metal,
        the metal-containing material becomes a residue. During the
        extraction step, batches of the metal-containing material can be
        moved between two or more stations in series, such as in
        baskets. The extractant can be moved through these stations in a
        direction opposite to the direction in which the batches of
        metal-containing material are moved. In this way, the
        metal-containing material is in contact with extractant having a
        lower concentration of the metal as the metal-containing
        material moves through the process and the concentration of
        metal in the metal-containing material decreases. </p>
      <p>[0012]The stripping step during which the extract is exposed to
        the stripping agent can be a countercurrent process. For
        example, the extract can be introduced into a first end of a
        countercurrent stripping column, while the stripping agent is
        introduced into a second end of the countercurrent stripping
        column, opposite to the first end. The stripping agent can be
        collected near the first end as the strip product and the
        extract can be collected near the second end as the raffinate.
        To increase dispersion, the stripping agent can be sprayed into
        the extract, such as at the second end of the stripping column.
      </p>
      <p>[0013]Some embodiments of the stripping step are configured to
        separate two or more metals from each other as well as from the
        remainder of the extract. These metals can have different
        oxidation numbers, which can cause the metals to disassociate
        from their respective metal-containing complexes at different
        times during the stripping step. In this way, a first strip
        product and a second strip product can be formed by
        fractionating the strip product. In some embodiments, the metals
        to be separated are gadolinium and uranium. These metals can be
        extracted, for example, from spent nuclear fuel. </p>
      <p>[0014]The complexing agent and the solvent can be recycled in a
        recycling step. This can begin by separating the solvent from
        the complexing agent by decreasing the pressure and/or
        increasing the temperature of the raffinate. This causes the
        solvent to become a recovered gas. The complexing agent
        separates out as a recovered complexing agent. Thereafter, the
        recovered complexing agent can be mixed with the oxidizing agent
        to form a recovered acid-base complex. The recovered acid-base
        complex then can be mixed with the solvent using a static mixer
        to form a recovered extractant. After it has been formed, the
        recovered extractant can be introduced into the extraction step.
        The solvent mixed with the recovered complexing agent to form
        the recovered extractant can be fresh solvent or recovered
        solvent, which is formed by condensing the recovered gas. </p>
      <p>[0015]As an alternative to separating the solvent from the
        complexing agent, in some embodiments, a recovered extractant is
        formed by recharging the raffinate with the oxidizing agent. In
        this way, the solvent can be substantially continuously
        maintained in liquid or supercritical fluid form. Recharging the
        raffinate can include introducing at least a portion of the
        raffinate into a first end of a countercurrent recharging column
        and introducing at least a portion of the oxidizing agent into a
        second end of the countercurrent recharging column. Within the
        recharging column, any complexing agent present can combine with
        the oxidizing agent to reform the acid-base pair. The raffinate
        then can be collected near the second end of the recharging
        column as the recovered extractant. Excess oxidizing agent can
        be collected near the first end of the recharging column. In
        some embodiments, the excess oxidizing agent is used as a
        stripping agent for separating the metal from the extract. This
        is especially useful if the stripping step includes two stages
        performed at different levels of acidity to separately remove
        more than one type of metal. </p>
      <p>[0016]In some disclosed embodiments, the solvent is a gas at
        room temperature and atmospheric pressure. For example, the
        solvent can be carbon dioxide. The stripping agent can be an
        aqueous liquid, such as water. The oxidizing agent can be nitric
        acid. The complexing agent can be tributylphosphate. The
        disclosed method and system can be used with a variety of
        metals, including uranium, gadolinium and plutonium. The
        metal-containing material can be a waste product, such as
        incinerator ash. In some disclosed embodiments, the metal
        accounts for less than about 30% of the weight of the
        metal-containing material. </p>
      <p>[0017]The disclosed system is well suited for performing the
        disclosed method. Some embodiments of the disclosed system
        include an extraction device and a countercurrent stripping
        device. The extraction device can include two or more stations
        and an extractant-distribution network configured to distribute
        the extractant from an extractant source to the two or more
        stations in series. Each station can include a container
        configured to hold a batch of solid metal-containing material
        and expose that metal-containing material to the extractant. The
        containers can be separable from the stations and
        interchangeable between the stations to facilitate movement of
        the batches of metal-containing material between the stations.
        The containers also can be elongated with an extractant inlet at
        one end and an extractant outlet at the opposite end. The
        extractant outlet can include a filter permeable to the
        extractant, but impermeable to the metal-containing material,
        such as a sintered metal filter. At least one of the stations
        can include an ultrasound emitting device for applying
        ultrasonic vibrations to the associated container during the
        extraction. The stations also can be configured for mechanical
        mixing. In some disclosed embodiments, the stations are
        configured to withstand internal pressures greater than about 20
        atm, greater than about 50 atm or even internal pressures
        greater than about 200 atm. </p>
      <p>[0018]The countercurrent stripping device can include a
        stripping column configured to expose an extract from the
        extraction device, including the liquid or supercritical fluid
        solvent, to a stripping agent. This column can have a first end
        with an extract inlet and a stripping product outlet and a
        second end with a stripping agent inlet and a raffinate outlet.
        The stripping agent inlet can be a sprayer. The stripping column
        can contain a surface area enhancing media, such as a metal,
        e.g. stainless steel, or plastic mesh, for increasing contact
        between the stripping agent and the extract. Like the stations,
        the stripping column can be configured to withstand internal
        pressures greater than about 20 atm, about 50 atm or about 200
        atm. In some disclosed embodiments, the countercurrent stripping
        device includes at least two stripping columns. The extract is
        routed through a first stripping column and then a second
        stripping column in series. The first stripping column can be
        configured primarily to separate the oxidizing agent from the
        extract, while the second stripping column is configured
        primarily to separate the metal from the extract. Multiple
        stripping columns also can be used to facilitate the separation
        of different metals, such as uranium and gadolinium. </p>
      <p>[0019]In addition to the extraction device and the
        countercurrent stripping device, some embodiments of the
        disclosed system include a recycling device for recycling the
        solvent and/or the complexing agent. The recycling device can
        include a separator configured to reduce the pressure and/or
        increase the temperature of the raffinate exiting the stripping
        device. The recycling device also can include an acid-base
        complex mixer for mixing the recovered complexing agent
        recovered from the raffinate with the oxidizing agent to form
        the recovered acid-base complex. In some disclosed embodiments,
        the recycling device includes a condenser for condensing the
        recovered gas recovered from the raffinate to form the recovered
        solvent in liquid or supercritical fluid form. The recovered
        acid-base complex can be mixed with the recovered solvent or
        fresh solvent with a mixer, such as a static mixer, to form a
        recovered extractant, which can be routed through the stations
        of the extraction device by an extractant-distribution network.
        In certain other embodiments, the recycling device includes a
        recharging column configured to expose the raffinate to the
        oxidizing agent to form a recovered extractant. These
        embodiments also can include a surge tank configured to hold the
        recovered extractant exiting the recharging column. The surge
        tank can have an inlet for receiving make-up liquid or
        supercritical-fluid solvent. </p>

      <p>[0033]Disclosed herein are a method for recovering metal from
        metal-containing material and a system that can be used with the
        disclosed method. The disclosed method and system are based on
        the direct extraction of a metal with an extractant including a
        liquid or supercritical fluid solvent. Some embodiments of the
        disclosed method can be used to generate aqueous solutions with
        high-concentrations of the target metal, such as concentrations
        greater than about 5% by weight, greater than about 10% by
        weight or greater than about 12% by weight, from starting
        materials with relatively low concentrations of the target
        metal, such as concentrations less than about 30% by weight,
        less than about 20% by weight or less than about 15% by weight.
      </p>
      <p>[0034]The disclosed method and system are particularly useful
        for the recovery of uranium from uranium-containing material. As
        discussed above, conventional approaches to uranium recovery
        have many disadvantages, including high cost and the generation
        of large amounts of hazardous waste. Direct extraction with an
        extractant including a liquid or supercritical-fluid solvent has
        potential as a cleaner and more efficient alternative to
        conventional uranium-recovery processes. For example, the
        disclosed extraction optionally can be performed without a
        separate nitric acid dissolution step. This reduces or
        eliminates the generation of gaseous oxides of nitrogen, reduces
        the amount of nitrate-containing liquid effluent, and reduces
        the amount and toxicity of the residual solid waste. </p>
      <p>[0035]In the extraction of uranium, the disclosed method can be
        used to generate a high-concentration uranyl nitrate solution
        that is more efficient to process into a final product than the
        low-concentration uranyl nitrate solution commonly produced by
        nitric acid dissolution in the PUREX process. In fact, when the
        disclosed extraction is applied to a uranium-containing material
        that contains very few non-uranium contaminants, the uranyl
        nitrate solution produced by the extraction can, in some cases,
        be concentrated enough to be converted directly into a final
        product, such as UO.sub.2, without the need for further
        treatment. </p>
      <p><b>Method</b> </p>
      <p>[0036]Embodiments of a method for the separation and recovery
        of metal from a metal-containing material using a liquid or
        supercritical-fluid solvent are disclosed. The disclosed
        embodiments are particularly well-suited for recovering uranium
        from uranium-containing material. Some embodiments of the
        disclosed method include one or more of the following three
        steps: (1) extraction, (2) stripping, and (3) recycling. These
        steps are described in greater detail below. </p>
      <p><b>Extraction</b> </p>
      <p>[0037]Some embodiments of the disclosed method begin with an
        extraction step. In this step, the metal-containing material is
        contacted with an extractant. The extractant can include, for
        example, a liquid or supercritical fluid solvent, an oxidizing
        agent and a complexing agent. Many of the solvents that are well
        suited for the extraction of metals are relatively non-polar.
        Most effective oxidizing agents, such as nitric acid, are not
        soluble in non-polar solvents. These oxidizing agents, however,
        can be made soluble by incorporation into an acid-base complex.
        For example, when nitric acid is bound to a compound such as
        TBP, the resulting acid-base complex is highly soluble in
        several non-polar solvents, including carbon dioxide. TBP
        therefore is capable of serving as a carrier for introducing
        nitric acid into the solvent. </p>
      <p>[0038]Embodiments of the disclosed extraction can be performed
        with solvents in either liquid or supercritical fluid form. A
        compound exists as a supercritical fluid when it is at a
        temperature and pressure above a critical temperature and
        pressure characteristic of the compound. FIG. 1 is a phase
        diagram for carbon dioxide, which shows the conditions necessary
        to produce liquid carbon dioxide and supercritical carbon
        dioxide. Materials in a supercritical state exhibit properties
        of both a gas and a liquid. Supercritical fluids typically are
        able to act as solvents, like subcritical liquids, while also
        exhibiting the improved penetration power of gases. This makes
        supercritical fluids a preferred class of solvents for metal
        extraction. The disclosed liquid solvents can be gases at room
        temperature and atmospheric pressure. These solvents are
        converted into liquids by increasing the pressure and/or
        decreasing the temperature. </p>
      <p>[0039]During the extraction of metals, such as uranium, with an
        acid-base complex including an oxidizing agent and a complexing
        agent, the oxidizing agent oxidizes the metal and the complexing
        agent binds to the metal, rendering it more soluble in the
        solvent than prior to complexation. After being oxidized, the
        metal can form stable complexes with the acid-base complex. For
        example, in the extraction of uranium with nitric acid as the
        oxidizing agent and TBP as the complexing agent, the uranium may
        form UO.sub.2(NO.sub.3).sub.2.2TBP. Uranium, gadolinium,
        plutonium, and many other lanthanides and actinides are capable
        of binding to large numbers of ligands. The disclosed process is
        especially well suited for the recovery of these metals. Most
        other metals do not share this property and are not capable of
        forming stable complexes with acid-base complexes such as
        TBP-HNO.sub.3. These metals can be recovered by adding a
        separate chelating agent to the extractant. </p>
      <p>[0040]One goal of the extraction step is to concentrate metal
        in the phase that includes the complexing agent. If the phase
        including the complexing agent has a high concentration of the
        metal to be recovered, the efficiency of the stripping step is
        improved. One way to increase the concentration of the metal to
        be recovered in the phase including the complexing agent is to
        decrease the amount of complexing agent in the extractant to
        which the metal-containing material is exposed. This method,
        however, can dramatically increase the required extraction time
        and therefore decrease the efficiency of the extraction process.
      </p>
      <p>[0041]Similar or superior results can be achieved without
        compromising efficiency by using a countercurrent extraction
        process. The disclosed countercurrent extraction process is a
        departure from conventional, single-batch extraction processes.
        In a single-batch process, the concentration gradient between
        the metal-containing material and the phase including the
        complexing agent decreases over time. The disclosed
        countercurrent extraction process maintains the concentration
        gradient by moving the extractant and the metal-containing
        material during the extraction. </p>
      <p>[0042]In some embodiments of the disclosed countercurrent
        extraction process, the extractant is moved through the
        extraction process in a first direction and the metal-containing
        material is moved though the extraction process in a second
        direction, opposite to the first direction. As the extractant
        moves in the first direction, the concentration of metal in the
        phase including the complexing agent increases. As the
        metal-containing material moves in the second direction, the
        concentration of metal in the metal-containing material
        decreases. Thus, the metal-containing material with the highest
        concentration of metal; i.e. the metal-containing material that
        has not yet been exposed to the extractant, first is exposed to
        extractant that has already been used to extract the metal from
        each of the other batches in the series. Only metal-containing
        material with a high metal concentration is capable of loading
        this used extractant with additional metal. Similarly, at the
        other end of the series, the metal-containing material with the
        lowest concentration of the metal is exposed to fresh
        extractant; otherwise, there would be an insufficient
        concentration gradient to drive the extraction. The
        countercurrent operation allows the disclosed process to
        maintain a concentration gradient between the metal-containing
        material and the phase including the complexing agent throughout
        the process. </p>
      <p>[0043]Some embodiments of the disclosed countercurrent
        extraction process are multi-stage, semi-batch processes.
        Multi-stage, semi-batch processes can be useful, for example,
        where the metal-containing material is difficult to move
        continuously or where the extraction requires long periods of
        contact between the metal-containing material and the
        extractant. In some disclosed embodiments, batches of the
        metal-containing material are placed in separate extraction
        stations. The extractant is introduced into these stations in
        series, with the used extractant from one station feeding the
        next station in a first order. The extractant can be moved
        continuously or it can be held at each station for an extraction
        period before being released into the next station. As the metal
        is recovered from the metal-containing material, the batches of
        metal-containing material can be moved from one extraction
        station to the next extraction station in a second order
        opposite to the first order. When the batches of metal have
        reached the end of the series of stations, the metal-containing
        material is at least partially depleted of the metal and can be
        referred to as residue. The residue is less toxic than the
        metal-containing material prior to extraction and its disposal
        is less problematic. </p>
      <p>[0044]Multi-stage, semi-batch embodiments of the disclosed
        extraction step can be used with any number of stations. In
        general, using a larger number of stations will result in a more
        complete separation. The completeness of the separation also can
        be dependent on the extraction time. In some embodiments, the
        batches of metal-containing material remain in each station for
        a set amount of time or for a time period effective to remove a
        certain amount of metal. In total, the metal-containing material
        can be, for example, exposed to the extractant for variable time
        periods, as would be understood by a person of ordinary skill in
        the art. Generally, the time period is between about 30 minutes
        and about 120 minutes, typically between about 40 minutes and
        about 100 minutes or more typically between about 50 minutes and
        about 80 minutes. The flow rate of the extractant through the
        extraction step can be, for example, between about 2 liters per
        hour and about 10 liters per hour, typically between about 3
        liters per hour and about 8 liters per hour or more typically
        between about 4 liters per hour and about 7 liters per hour. The
        extraction step can be configured to recover varying amounts of
        the metal in the metal-containing material, such as between
        about 60% and about 100% of the metal, typically between about
        80% and about 100% of the metal or more typically between about
        85% and about 100% of the metal. </p>
      <p><b>Stripping</b> </p>
      <p>[0045]Some embodiments of the disclosed method include a
        stripping step after the extraction step. After extracting the
        metal from the metal-containing material and completing the
        overall extraction step, the extractant can be referred to as an
        extract. The extract typically contains the solvent and
        complexes including the metal and the acid-base complex. The
        stripping step is intended to separate the metal from the
        extract. Stripping can be accomplished, for example, by exposing
        the extract to a stripping agent that has a higher affinity for
        metal than the extract. By way of theory, and without limiting
        disclosed embodiments to such theory, the oxidizing agent in the
        extract typically has a high affinity for the stripping agent
        and is the first component of the extract to be separated. As
        the concentration of the oxidizing agent decreases, the
        metal-containing complexes disassociate and the metal ions
        migrate into the stripping agent. In order to keep the stripping
        agent separate from the extract, it is helpful to select a
        stripping agent that is immiscible with, or at least separable
        from, the extract. </p>
      <p>[0046]If two or more different metals are present in the
        extract, the stripping step also may be useful for separating
        these metals from each other. Metal ions with different charges,
        for example, form complexes with different numbers of acid-base
        complexes and, therefore, may separate from their associated
        acid-base complexes at different pH values. The pH of the
        extract can be determined primarily by the concentration of the
        oxidizing agent. Metals with higher charges require a larger
        number of anions to neutralize their charge and may disassociate
        from their respective metal-containing complexes at higher
        concentrations of the oxidizing agent. </p>
      <p>[0047]Separating different metals in the extract from each
        other is particularly useful for processing spent nuclear fuel
        rods and other waste material that contains both uranium and
        gadolinium. Gadolinium-containing particles commonly are
        introduced into fuel rods as burnable poison to contain fission
        products. Both uranium and gadolinium form stable complexes with
        acid-base complexes, such as TBP-HNO.sub.3, at high
        concentrations of the oxidizing agent and can thereby be
        solubilized in non-polar solvents, such as supercritical carbon
        dioxide. The uranium ion, however, typically has a plus two
        charge, while the gadolinium ion typically has a plus three
        charge. If the acid anion of the oxidizing agent has a plus one
        charge, uranium will associate with two acid-base complexes,
        while gadolinium will associate with three acid-base complexes.
        In the stripping step, as the oxidizing agent migrates into the
        stripping agent, the gadolinium-containing complexes will
        disassociate before the uranium-containing complexes. The
        uranium and gadolinium therefore can be separated by fractioning
        the strip product. In some embodiments, the gadolinium enters
        the stripping agent when the concentration of the oxidizing
        agent in the extract is between about 2 M and about 3 M and the
        uranium enters the stripping agent when the concentration of the
        oxidizing agent in the extract is between about 0.1 M and about
        0.5 M. </p>
      <p>[0048]Before and during the stripping step, the solvent can be
        in liquid or supercritical form. In some embodiments, the
        solvent is maintained in liquid form because the improved
        penetration power of a supercritical-fluid solvent is no longer
        necessary. To provide adequate volumes for the stripping step,
        the solvent can be separated from the extract and replaced with
        new solvent flowing in a continuous stream. </p>
      <p>[0049]The stripping step can be a countercurrent process. While
        the extract is moving through the process in a first direction,
        the stripping agent is moving through the process in a second
        direction opposite to the first direction. The stripping agent
        often has a greater affinity for the oxidizing agent than for
        the metal. For example, the solubility of nitric acid in certain
        aqueous stripping agents, such as water, is greater than the
        solubility of uranyl ions in these stripping agents. In addition
        to maximizing the concentration gradient, the countercurrent
        design can allow both the oxidizing agent and the metal to be
        removed. In contrast, if both liquids move in the same
        direction, the stripping agent quickly would become loaded with
        the oxidizing agent and then would be incapable of removing a
        significant quantity of the metal. </p>
      <p>[0050]Where the solubility difference between the oxidizing
        agent and the metal is particularly high, it may be useful to
        separate the stripping step into two or more stages. In a first
        stage, for example, the solute with the higher solubility in the
        stripping agent, such as the oxidizing agent, can be removed.
        Then, the extract can be routed into a second stage in which
        fresh stripping agent is used to remove the less soluble
        component, such as the metal. In this way, the presence of the
        more soluble component does not significantly inhibit the
        removal of the less soluble component. Multiple stages also may
        be useful for separating different metals that enter the
        stripping agent under different conditions and at different
        times during the stripping process, such as uranium and
        gadolinium. </p>
      <p>[0051]The efficiency of the stripping process is affected by
        the amount of contact between the stripping agent and the
        extract. Because the stripping agent and the extract usually are
        immiscible, achieving this contact can be difficult. In some
        disclosed embodiments, the stripping agent is sprayed into the
        extract. The spraying action creates small droplets with a
        collective surface area far greater than the surface area of
        larger masses of liquid. The larger surface area of the droplets
        serves as a larger interface between the stripping agent and the
        extract, which improves the rate of mass transfer. In some
        disclosed embodiments, the extract flows through a
        high-surface-area stripping medium that helps to prevent the
        droplets from coalescing prematurely. </p>
      <p>[0052]After gathering the metal, the stripping agent can exit
        the stripping step as a strip product. The solvent exits the
        stripping step with the complexing agent as a raffinate. In one
        embodiment where the metal is uranium, the stripping agent is
        water and the oxidizing agent is nitric acid, the strip product
        can be a concentrated uranyl nitrate solution. Direct
        dissolution of uranium-containing material with nitric acid,
        such as in the PUREX process, also can produce a uranyl nitrate
        solution, but the uranyl nitrate solution produced by the
        disclosed method typically is much more concentrated than that
        produced by the PUREX process. Thus, fewer additional steps, if
        any, are needed before the uranyl nitrate solution produced by
        the disclosed method can be converted into an end product, such
        as UO.sub.2. In contrast, the uranyl nitrate solution produced
        by the PUREX process typically is dilute and requires additional
        steps, such as additional liquid-liquid extractions, to
        concentrate the uranium. This is particularly true when the
        PUREX process is applied to recover uranium from materials with
        a relatively low concentration of uranium, such as incinerator
        ash, and when the PUREX process is applied to recover uranium
        from materials containing an additional metal, such as
        gadolinium. </p>
      <p>[0053]The flow rates of the extractant and the stripping agent
        can affect the amount of metal removed from the phase including
        the complexing agent. The flow rate of the extractant can be,
        for example, between about 10 liters per hour and about 100
        liters per hour, between about 15 liters per hour and about 50
        liters per hour or between about 20 liters per hour and about 30
        liters per hour. The flow rate of the stripping agent can be,
        for example, between about 1 liter per hour and about 8 liters
        per hour, between about 1.5 liters per hour and about 5 liters
        per hour or between about 2 liters per hour and about 3 liters
        per hour. The total cycle time for the stripping step can be,
        for example, between about 30 minutes and about 120 minutes,
        between about 40 minutes and about 100 minutes or between about
        50 minutes and about 80 minutes. The amount of metal removed
        from the extractant can be, for example, between about 50% and
        about 100%, between about 70% and about 100% or between about
        90% and about 100%. </p>
      <p><b>Recycling</b> </p>
      <p>[0054]Some embodiments of the disclosed method include a
        recycling step. Recycling limits the amount of hazardous waste
        produced by the process and has the potential to reduce the
        overall cost of the process. The recycling step can include
        recycling various materials used or formed during the process,
        such as the complexing agent, the solvent, or both. As mentioned
        above, in some disclosed embodiments, the complexing agent and
        the solvent exit the stripping step as a raffinate. This
        raffinate is different from the extractant in that at least a
        portion of the oxidizing agent has been consumed. Thus, the
        raffinate typically is not recycled directly into the extraction
        step without additional processing. </p>
      <p>[0055]In some disclosed embodiments, the solvent is separated
        from the complexing agent by reducing the pressure and/or
        increasing the temperature of the raffinate. After the
        separation, the solvent from the raffinate becomes a recovered
        gas and the complexing agent from the raffinate becomes a
        recovered complexing agent. The recovered complexing agent can
        be combined with the oxidizing agent to form a recovered
        acid-base complex. The recovered gas can be condensed to form a
        recovered solvent in liquid or supercritical fluid form. The
        recovered acid-base complex can be combined either with the
        recovered solvent or with fresh solvent to form a recovered
        extractant. After it has been prepared, the recovered extractant
        can be reintroduced into the process at the extraction step, as
        described above. </p>
      <p>[0056]In embodiments that include a recycling step, the
        efficiency of the stripping step affects the efficiency of the
        extraction step. Typically, the stripping step does not remove
        100% of the metal from the phase including the complexing agent.
        The remaining metal is carried in the raffinate and then
        incorporated into the recovered complexing agent, the recovered
        acid-base complex and the recovered extractant. The presence of
        metal in the extractant decreases the efficiency of the
        extraction step. It is useful, therefore to separate as much
        metal as possible in the stripping step. </p>
      <p>[0057]Another approach to the recycling step is to recharge the
        raffinate with oxidizing agent without separating the solvent.
        For example, the raffinate can be introduced into one end of a
        countercurrent column while the oxidizing agent is introduced
        into the opposite end. As the raffinate contacts the oxidizing
        agent within the column, any complexing agent present can
        combine with the oxidizing agent to reform the acid-base
        complex. The recharged raffinate then can be routed to the
        extraction step and used as a recovered extractant. </p>
      <p><b>System</b> </p>
      <p>[0058]FIG. 2 illustrates one embodiment of the disclosed system
        for recovering a metal from a metal-containing material. The
        system 10 shown in FIG. 2 includes an extraction device 12, a
        stripping device 14 and a recycling device 16. The extraction
        device 12 includes a first station 18 and a second station 20.
        The stripping device 14 includes a stripping column 22. The
        recycling device 16 includes a separator 24, an acid-base
        complex mixer 26, a condenser 28, a solvent tank 30 and a static
        mixer 32. </p>
      <p>[0059]In operation, the first station 18 contains a first batch
        of metal-containing material 34 and the second station 20
        contains a second batch of metal-containing material 36.
        Extractant enters the second station 20 via a second station
        extractant inlet 38. After extracting metal from the second
        batch of metal-containing material 36, the extractant exits the
        second station 20 via a second station extractant outlet 40 and
        is routed into the first station 18 through the first station
        extractant inlet 42. After extracting metal from the first batch
        of metal-containing material 34, the extractant exits the first
        station 18 via a first station extractant outlet 44. During the
        extraction, the second batch of metal-containing material 36 is
        moved out of the second station 20 and then to further
        processing or disposal. The first batch of metal-containing
        material 34 is moved out of the first station 18 and into the
        second station 20. In general, extractant moves through the
        extraction step in a first direction and metal-containing
        material moves thorough the extraction step in a second
        direction opposite to the first direction and indicated by
        arrows 46. </p>
      <p>[0060]Movement of the metal-containing material 34, 36 is
        facilitated by a first container 48 and a second container 50,
        located in the first and second stations 18, 20, respectively.
        The first and second containers 48, 50 are removable and
        interchangeable between the first and second stations 18, 20.
        The first and second containers 48, 50 also are configured to
        maximize contact between the extractant and the metal-containing
        material 34, 36. The first and second containers 48, 50 both are
        elongated. The extractant is routed directly into the first and
        second containers 48, 50 at their top ends and is forced to
        travel along the length of each container through the
        metal-containing material until it reaches a first and second
        filter 51, 52 positioned at the bottom of the first and second
        containers 48, 50, respectively. The first and second filters
        51, 52 allow passage of the extractant, while blocking passage
        of the metal-containing material. </p>
      <p>[0061]After the extractant leaves the extraction device 12 it
        can be referred to as an extract. The extract enters the
        stripping column 22 at an extract inlet 53. As the extract moves
        up the stripping column 22 toward a raffinate outlet 54, a
        stripping agent moves down the stripping column 22 from a
        stripping agent inlet 56 to a strip product outlet 58. The
        extract inlet 53 and the strip product outlet 58 are located
        near a first end 60 of the stripping column 22. The raffinate
        outlet 54 and the stripping agent inlet 56 are located near a
        second end 62 of the stripping column 22. The first end 60 of
        the stripping column 22 and the second end 62 of the stripping
        column 22 are the bottom and top ends, respectively. </p>
      <p>[0062]The strip product exiting the stripping column 22 moves
        on for further processing. The raffinate moves into the
        recycling device 16. The raffinate first enters the separator 24
        through a separator raffinate inlet 64. Within the separator 24,
        the pressure is reduced and the raffinate is separated into a
        recovered gas 66 and a recovered complexing agent 68. The
        recovered gas 66 exits the separator 24 and then flows into the
        condenser 28. The condenser 28 converts the recovered gas 66
        into a recovered solvent that flows into the solvent tank 30.
        Meanwhile, the recovered complexing agent 68 flows out of the
        separator 24 and into the acid-base complex mixer 26. An
        oxidizing agent enters the acid-base complex mixer 26 through an
        acid-base complex mixer oxidizing agent inlet 70. A mixer 72
        combines the oxidizing agent and the recovered complexing agent
        to form a recovered acid-base complex. The recovered acid-base
        complex exits the acid-base mixer 26 and is combined with the
        recovered solvent exiting the solvent tank 30 with the static
        mixer 32. After being mixed by the static mixer 32, the
        recovered solvent and the recovered complexing agent 68 form a
        recovered extractant, which flows into the extraction device 12
        at the second station extractant inlet 38. </p>
      <p>[0063]FIG. 3 illustrates a system 80, which is another
        embodiment of the disclosed system for recovering a metal from a
        metal-containing material. The reference numerals from FIG. 2
        are repeated in FIG. 3 to indicate similar or identical
        elements. The main difference between the system 80 in FIG. 3
        and the system 10 in FIG. 2 is that the stripping device 14 in
        the system 80 in FIG. 3 includes first and second stripping
        columns 22, 82, whereas the stripping device 14 in the system 10
        in FIG. 2 only includes one stripping column 22. In the system
        80, the raffinate from the first stripping column 22 is exposed
        to fresh stripping agent in the second stripping column 82. </p>
      <p>[0064]With regard to FIG. 3, after it leaves the first
        stripping column 22, the raffinate can be referred to as an
        intermediate raffinate. The intermediate raffinate is routed
        into the second stripping column 82 through an intermediate
        raffinate inlet 84. As the intermediate raffinate moves up the
        second stripping column 82 toward a final raffinate outlet 86,
        the stripping agent moves down the second stripping column 82
        from a second stripping agent inlet 88 to a second strip product
        outlet 90. The intermediate raffinate inlet 84 and the second
        strip product outlet 90 are located near a first end 92 of the
        second stripping column 82. The final raffinate outlet 86 and
        the second stripping agent inlet 88 are located near a second
        end 94 of the second stripping column 82. The first end 92 of
        the second stripping column 82 and the second end 94 of the
        second stripping column 82 are the bottom and top ends,
        respectively. From the second stripping column 82, the final
        raffinate is routed into the separator 24 through the separator
        raffinate inlet 64. The strip product from the first stripping
        column 22 and the strip product from the second stripping column
        82 typically are processed separately. Alternatively, the strip
        products can be combined for further processing. </p>
      <p>[0065]FIG. 4 illustrates yet another embodiment of the
        disclosed system. The reference numerals from FIGS. 2 and 3 are
        repeated in FIG. 4 to indicate similar or identical elements.
        The system 100 is similar to the system 80 illustrated in FIG.
        3, except with respect to the recycling device 16. In the system
        100, the recycling device 16 includes a recharging column 102
        configured to receive the raffinate exiting the second stripping
        column 82. The recharging column 102 has a first end 104 and a
        second end 106. The raffinate enters the recharging column 102
        at a recharging column raffinate inlet 108 located near the
        first end 104 of the recharging column 102. Oxidizing agent
        enters the recharging column 102 at a recharging column
        oxidizing agent inlet 110 located near the second end 106 of the
        recharging column 102. As the raffinate contacts the oxidizing
        agent within the recharging column 102, the complexing agent
        within the raffinate combines with the oxidizing agent to reform
        the acid-base complex. A recovered extractant including the
        solvent and the reformed acid-base complex then exits the
        recharging column 102 at a recovered extractant outlet 112
        located near the second end 106 of the recharging column 102.
        Excess oxidizing agent exits the recharging column 102 at an
        excess oxidizing agent outlet 114 located near the first end 104
        of the recharging column 102. </p>
      <p>[0066]After exiting the recharging column 102, the excess
        oxidizing agent is routed to the stripping agent inlet 56 of the
        stripping column 22. The recovered extractant is routed into a
        surge tank 116. If necessary, make-up solvent and/or complexing
        agent can be added to the surge tank 116 through a make-up
        solvent/complexing agent inlet 118. From the surge tank 116, the
        recovered extractant flows into the second station 20 of the
        extraction device 12. A booster pump can be included near the
        surge tank 116 to provide the necessary motive force. </p>
      <p>[0067]The embodiments illustrated in FIGS. 2-4 are merely
        exemplary. This disclosure also describes additional embodiments
        not limited to the particular features illustrated in FIGS. 2-4.
        As illustrated in FIGS. 2-4, embodiments of the system can
        include several devices that work together to perform the
        overall extraction. Three of these devices are discussed in the
        following subsections. </p>
      <p><b>Extraction Device</b> </p>
      <p>[0068]As discussed above, a first step in the recovery of a
        metal from a metal-containing material can be an extraction
        step. In some embodiments of the disclosed method, extraction is
        performed by exposing the metal-containing material to an
        extractant including a liquid or supercritical fluid solvent. In
        addition to the solvent, the extractant can include an acid-base
        complex including an oxidizing agent and a complexing agent.
        Some embodiments of the disclosed system include an extraction
        device, such as extraction device 12, for carrying out the
        extraction step. </p>
      <p>[0069]The extraction device can be designed for the extraction
        of metals, such as uranium, from solid materials, such as
        incinerator ash. Solid materials can be difficult to move
        through continuous processes, so most conventional extraction
        processes involving solid materials are batch processes. Batch
        processes also make it easier to expose the metal-containing
        material to the extractant for long periods of time. Batch
        processes, however, often are characterized by lower extraction
        efficiencies than continuous processes. This is because, as
        discussed above, batch processes are less effective at
        maintaining a concentration gradient between the extractant and
        the metal-containing material than countercurrent processes. </p>
      <p>[0070]Many of the advantages of batch processing can be
        achieved without unduly sacrificing extraction efficiency by
        using a semi-batch process. Some embodiments of the disclosed
        extraction device include two or more extraction stations, each
        of which operates in a manner similar to a single batch
        extraction device. The extractant can be routed through these
        stations in series. Meanwhile, the batches of metal-containing
        material can be moved between the stations in an order
        countercurrent to the order in which extractant is moved. The
        countercurrent operation allows the disclosed process to
        maintain a concentration gradient between the metal-containing
        material and the extractant throughout the process. </p>
      <p>[0071]Embodiments of the disclosed extraction device can
        include a network of piping routed through the stations in
        series. At one end of the series, an extractant inlet can be
        positioned to receive the extractant, e.g. from the recycling
        device. At the opposite end of the series an extractant outlet
        can be positioned to release the extractant, e.g. to the
        stripping device. Between the stations, pipes can be positioned
        to route used extractant from one station to the next station in
        series. </p>
      <p>[0072]Each station can include a container for holding
        metal-containing material, such as solid metal-containing
        material. The containers, for example, can be cylindrical with
        solid walls and a bottom that is permeable to the extractant.
        The extractant can be introduced at the top of these containers
        so that it is forced to flow through the metal-containing
        material before it exits at the bottom of the container. The
        permeable portions of the container can be made of any useful
        material, such as sintered metal, which is permeable to liquids
        and gases, but not permeable to solids. After it flows through
        the container, the extractant can flow into the portion of the
        station external to the container before it is released through
        the station's extract outlet. </p>
      <p>[0073]The stations in some embodiments of the disclosed
        extraction device are configured to allow the batches of
        metal-containing material to be transported between the
        stations. For example, the containers within the stations can be
        removable and interchangeable. In this way, the container in one
        station can be removed from that station with its batch of
        metal-containing material and then moved into the next station
        in the series. The batch of metal-containing material in the
        container at the end of the series can removed for disposal or
        further processing. The container at the end of the series then
        can be filled with raw metal-containing material and introduced
        into the first station in the series. Movement of the containers
        can be facilitated, for example, with handles designed to be
        gripped by a human or robotic operator. </p>
      <p>[0074]Is some disclosed embodiments, the stations are
        configured to promote the extraction process by providing
        agitation. Agitation can be provided by any suitable means,
        including physical mixing and ultrasonic vibration. For example,
        one or more of the stations can be equipped with a magnetic stir
        bar or an ultrasound emitting device operable to apply
        ultrasonic vibrations to contents contained in the interior of
        the station. </p>
      <p>[0075]The solvents well-suited for use in the disclosed process
        typically are gases at room temperature and atmospheric
        pressure. Maintaining these solvents in liquid form requires
        high pressures and/or low temperatures. Maintaining these
        solvents in supercritical fluid form requires high pressures and
        can require elevated temperatures depending on the critical
        temperature of the solvent. Some embodiments of the disclosed
        extraction device include stations that are configured to
        withstand high pressures, such as pressures greater than about
        20 atm, about 50 atm or about 200 atm. For example, these
        stations can have rounded walls that are thick enough to
        withstand the high pressures. The extraction device also can
        include chillers and/or heaters to maintain the extractant at
        the proper temperature, such as above its critical temperature
        if the solvent is to be maintained in supercritical fluid form.
        The extraction device also can be insulated. </p>
      <p>[0076]In some disclosed embodiments, the containers within the
        stations are designed to be moved after the stations have been
        evacuated. To allow this, the extractant inlets and outlets on
        each station can be fully closed to isolate each station from
        the extractant. The stations also can be isolated in this manner
        to allow the metal-containing material to soak in a volume of
        extractant for an extended period of time. </p>
      <p><b>Stripping Device</b> </p>
      <p>[0077]In some embodiments of the disclosed method, the metal
        from the metal-containing material is made soluble in the
        solvent by oxidation and complexation with a complexing agent.
        The metal in the extract can be bound within complexes including
        the complexing agent and/or the oxidizing agent. Some
        embodiments of the disclosed system include a stripping device
        configured to separate the metal from one or more of the
        solvent, the complexing agent, the oxidizing agent and other
        metals. The stripping device, for example, can be configured to
        expose the extract exiting the extraction step to a stripping
        agent. </p>
      <p>[0078]The stripping device can include a stripping column, such
        as a countercurrent stripping column. The extract can be
        introduced into the column at an extract inlet and then exit the
        column, after being depleted of metal, at a raffinate outlet.
        The extract inlet and the raffinate outlet typically are at
        opposite ends of the column. In a similar manner, the stripping
        agent can be introduced into the column at a stripping agent
        inlet and then exit the column, after gaining metal, at a strip
        product outlet. Like the extract inlet and the raffinate outlet,
        the stripping agent inlet and the strip product outlet typically
        are at opposite ends of the column. In embodiments in which the
        stripping column is configured for countercurrent operation, the
        extract inlet and the strip product outlet can be positioned
        near a first end of the column and the stripping agent inlet and
        the raffinate outlet can be positioned near a second end of the
        column opposite to the first end. Whether the first and second
        ends are the top and bottom ends, respectively, or the bottom
        and top ends, respectively, depends on the relative densities of
        the extract and the stripping agent. For example, if the
        stripping agent has a higher density than the extract, it will
        be pulled down by the force of gravity, so the first end, which
        includes the strip product outlet, can be the bottom end of the
        column and the second end, which includes the stripping agent
        inlet, can be the top end of the column. </p>
      <p>[0079]Countercurrent operation is particularly useful if there
        is a difference in the affinity of the stripping agent for the
        oxidizing agent versus the metal. For example, in a
        countercurrent stripping column, if the stripping agent has a
        higher affinity for the oxidizing agent than for the metal, the
        oxidizing agent is removed from the extract near the point at
        which the extract enters the column. As the extract moves
        through the column it becomes depleted of the oxidizing agent
        and begins to contact the stripping agent closer to the point at
        which the stripping agent enters the column. Therefore, the
        extract contacts the freshest stripping agent after the
        oxidizing agent has been significantly depleted. The gradual
        depletion of the oxidizing agent also can facilitate the
        separate removal of different metals, such as uranium and
        gadolinium. </p>
      <p>[0080]In some disclosed embodiments, the stripping device
        includes two or more stripping columns. This is especially
        useful if the stripping agent cannot easily be loaded with both
        the metal and the oxidizing agent. For example, in some
        applications, the presence of one solute in the stripping agent
        significantly affects the ability of the stripping agent to
        remove the other solute from the extract. In the first stripping
        column, the extract can be depleted of the component with a
        higher solubility in the stripping agent. An intermediate
        raffinate exiting the first stripping column then can be routed
        into the second stripping column where fresh stripping agent can
        be introduced to separate the component with a lower solubility
        in the stripping agent. The strip product from both stripping
        columns then can be combined. </p>
      <p>[0081]Separate stripping columns also can be used to facilitate
        the separation of different metals within the extract, such as
        uranium and gadolinium. The metal that enters the stripping
        agent first can be removed in a first strip product from the
        first column and the metal that enters the stripping agent later
        can be removed in a second strip product from the second
        stripping column. Where the first and second strip products
        contain different metals, they typically are processed
        separately, rather than combined. </p>
      <p>[0082]Embodiments of the disclosed stripping device typically
        are configured for liquid-liquid stripping processes. These
        processes rely on solubility differences between two immiscible
        liquids to drive the solute from one liquid into the other. The
        rate of mass transfer is improved by increasing the amount of
        contact between the two liquids. This can be done, for example,
        by vigorously mixing the liquids or by introducing one liquid
        into the column as droplets. The surface area of small droplets
        of liquid is far greater than the surface area of the same
        volume of liquid in a unified clump or stream. The liquid in
        droplet form can be referred to as the dispersed phase.
        Embodiments of the disclosed stripping device typically are
        configured to introduce the stripping agent as the dispersed
        phase. </p>
      <p>[0083]One way to separate a liquid into small droplets is to
        pass the liquid through a sprayer. In some embodiments of the
        disclosed stripping device, the stripping agent is sprayed into
        the stripping column with a sprayer. The stripping column can
        have one sprayer or multiple sprayers distributed along the
        length of the column. Multiple sprayers allow fresh stripping
        agent to be introduced at different points throughout the
        column. In some disclosed embodiments, the stripping agent is
        sprayed into the extract as the extract flows through the column
        in an upward direction, such that droplets of stripping agent
        are suspended within the extract and move in a downward
        direction opposite to the direction of the extract by the force
        of gravity. The extract collects at the top end of the stripping
        column and exits at the top of the stripping column. Droplets of
        stripping agent coalesce into a pool at the bottom of the
        stripping column. The pools of extract and stripping agent at
        the ends of the stripping column tend to be relatively
        homogeneous because of the immiscibility of the liquids. The
        size of the stripping agent pool can be controlled by adjusting
        the flow rate of the stripping agent out of the stripping column
        and maintaining a constant interface between the two phases at
        the bottom of the column. </p>
      <p>[0084]Droplets of a liquid floating in an immiscible liquid
        tend to gravitate towards each other over time. In some
        disclosed embodiments, this process is delayed by incorporating
        a high-surface area stripping medium into the stripping column.
        A high-surface area stripping medium can serve to attract the
        small droplets and thereby delay their conglomeration. One
        example of a high-surface-area stripping medium suitable for
        prolonging the separation of immiscible liquids is fiber mesh.
        The fiber mesh can be made from any suitable material, such as
        metal (e.g. stainless steel) or plastic. The mesh can terminate
        near the inlets for the extract and the stripping agent to allow
        the stripping agent to pool beyond the extract inlet and the
        extract to pool beyond the stripping agent inlet. Another way to
        prolong the separation of the liquids is to recollect the
        dispersed phase at several points along the length of the column
        and then spray it back into the column after each collection
        point. Alternately, the liquid in the stripping column can be
        pulsed to force coalesced dispersed phase droplets through
        intermediate perforated plates to reform small droplets of the
        dispersed phase. </p>
      <p>[0085]It is beneficial for the extract to include the solvent
        in order to maintain a sufficient density difference between the
        phases to allow for proper column operation and phase
        separation. It can be important to prevent the solvent from
        evaporating significantly before or during the stripping step.
        It can be useful, therefore, to maintain the solvent in liquid
        or supercritical fluid form before and during the stripping
        step. Most of the solvents used with the disclosed method
        require high pressures and/or low temperatures to remain in
        liquid form. In order to maintain the solvents in supercritical
        form, high pressures and elevated temperatures typically are
        required. Like the extraction stations, embodiments of the
        stripping column can be configured to maintain the solvent at
        high pressures, such as pressures greater than about 20 atm,
        about 50 atm or about 200 atm. The stripping column can, for
        example, include reinforced, rounded walls. </p>
      <p>[0086]In embodiments in which the stripping agent is sprayed
        into the column, the stripping agent inlet can be a
        high-pressure sprayer. The source of the stripping agent can be
        at a high enough pressure to spray the stripping agent into the
        column without significant backflow. For example, backflow
        desirably may be minimized or substantially eliminated,
        especially where the stripping agent is water and the stripping
        column is attached to a shared water supply. As a precaution,
        some disclosed embodiments are supplied with a stripping agent
        that is stored in a dedicated stripping agent supply tank.
        Embodiments of the stripping device also can be configured to
        maintain the extract at the proper temperature, such as with
        insulation and chillers or heaters. </p>
      <p><b>Recycling Device</b> </p>
      <p>[0087]To minimize the amount of liquid waste and to save on the
        cost of materials, some embodiments of the disclosed method
        incorporate a recycling step. This step can be carried out by a
        recycling device. The recycling device can be configured to
        recycle the complexing agent, the solvent or both. With the
        disclosed recycling device, the disclosed system can be highly
        contained, with little need for make-up solvent or make-up
        complexing agent. </p>
      <p>[0088]The complexing agent and the solvent typically are
        present in a single phase before the recycling step. In some
        disclosed embodiments, the solvent is separated from the
        complexing agent before they are recycled, so that the
        complexing agent can be recharged with the oxidizing agent to
        replace the oxidizing agent consumed in the extraction step. The
        result is the formation of a recycled acid-base complex. In
        other embodiments, the acid-base complex is reformed without
        separating the complexing agent from the solvent. In these
        embodiments, the solvent can remain in liquid or supercritical
        fluid form at all times, except, for example, when the process
        is shut down for maintenance. </p>
      <p>[0089]In some disclosed embodiments, a raffinate, such as the
        raffinate exiting the stripping device, enters a separator. The
        separator separates the solvent from the complexing agent by
        decreasing the pressure and/or increasing the temperature of the
        raffinate. Solvents for use with the disclosed process can be
        selected to evaporate at higher pressures and/or lower
        temperatures than the pressures and temperatures at which the
        complexing agents evaporate. For example, most of the disclosed
        solvents are gases at room temperature and atmospheric pressure,
        while most of the disclosed complexing agents are liquids at
        room temperature and atmospheric pressure. For most of the
        disclosed combinations of solvents and complexing agents,
        decreasing the pressure is a simple and efficient way to effect
        a virtually complete separation. </p>
      <p>[0090]Separators for use with disclosed embodiments of the
        recycling device can reduce the pressure of the raffinate, for
        example, with a let-down valve. The let-down valve can be
        positioned near an inlet to an expansion tank. In some disclosed
        embodiments, the solvent is vented to the atmosphere or vented
        to a pollution control device. In other disclosed embodiments,
        some or all of the solvent is recycled. </p>
      <p>[0091]The liquid outlet of the separator can be routed into an
        acid-base complex mixer. Within the acid-base complex mixer, the
        recovered complexing agent can be mixed with fresh oxidizing
        agent entering from an oxidizing agent source. The acid-base
        complex mixer typically does not need to be at high pressure
        because the recovered complexing agent and the oxidizing agent
        typically are liquids at room temperature and atmospheric
        pressure. In some disclosed embodiments, the acid-base complex
        mixer includes a tank with a mechanical mixing device. Typically
        the complexing agent and the oxidizing agent are miscible and
        only a limited amount of mixing is required. </p>
      <p>[0092]In embodiments in which the solvent is recycled, the
        solvent exiting the separator as a gas can be converted into a
        recovered liquid or supercritical-fluid solvent. This can be
        done, for example, by decreasing the temperature and/or
        increasing the pressure of the solvent. Less energy is used by
        this process if the solvent is maintained at a relatively high
        pressure and/or low temperature after being separated from the
        complexing agent. For example, the separator can be configured
        to decrease the pressure and/or increase the temperature of the
        raffinate only as much as is required to perform the separation.
        If the solvent exiting the separator in gas form is at a high
        enough pressure, it may be possible to convert the solvent back
        into liquid or supercritical fluid form solely by decreasing its
        temperature in a condenser. </p>
      <p>[0093]After the recovered complexing agent has been combined
        with the oxidizing agent to form a recovered acid-base complex
        and the solvent has been converted back into liquid or
        supercritical fluid form, the recovered liquid or
        supercritical-fluid solvent can be combined with the recovered
        acid-base complex to form a recovered extractant. This
        combination step typically occurs at high pressure because the
        solvent must be maintained in liquid or supercritical fluid
        form. In some disclosed embodiments, the recovered liquid or
        supercritical-fluid solvent is mixed with the recovered
        acid-base complex in a static mixer. The static mixer can be any
        device capable of mixing the recovered liquid or
        supercritical-fluid solvent and the recovered acid-base complex
        with few or no moving parts. Some static mixers include pipes
        with fixed internal components, such as blades, that agitate the
        liquids as the liquids flow through the mixer. Static mixers are
        well suited for mixing fluids at high pressure. In contrast,
        non-static mixers, such as mixers with mixing blades that
        rotate, tend to be unreliable at high pressures. </p>
      <p>[0094]Embodiments of the disclosed system configured to reform
        the acid-base pair without separating the complexing agent from
        the solvent can include a recharging column. The recharging
        column can be configured to mix the raffinate with fresh
        oxidizing agent so as to allow any complexing agent present to
        recombine with the oxidizing agent and thereby reform the
        acid-base pair. The solvent and the reformed acid-base pair can
        exit the recharging column as a recovered extractant. Excess
        oxidizing agent can be used as a stripping agent in one of the
        upstream stripping columns. For example, the excess oxidizing
        agent can be introduced into a first stripping column configured
        to separate a metal that disassociates with the acid-base
        complex at a lower pH than a second metal. A stripping agent
        with a higher pH then can be used in a second stripping column
        downstream from the first stripping column to separate the
        second metal. </p>
      <p>[0095]After it is formed, either with or without separation of
        the complexing agent from the solvent, the recovered extractant
        can be routed directly into the extraction device, as discussed
        above. Make-up solvent and/or complexing agent also can be
        added, if necessary. In some embodiments of the disclosed system
        a valve between the recycling device and the extraction device
        allows for precise control of the flow rate of the recovered
        extractant entering the extraction device. </p>
      <p><b>Materials</b> </p>
      <p>[0096]The disclosed method and system are highly versatile and
        capable of using a variety of different materials to serve a
        variety of functions. Some of the classes of materials that can
        be used with the disclosed method and system are discussed in
        greater detain below. </p>
      <p><b>Metal and Metal-Containing Material</b> </p>
      <p>[0097]The disclosed method and system can be used to recover a
        variety of metals from a variety of metal-containing materials.
        Different metals can be targeted, for example, by changing the
        oxidizing agent, the complexing agent, the stripping agent, or
        any combination thereof. Among complexing agents, for example,
        TBP is well suited for the recovery of lanthanides and
        actinides, such as uranium, gadolinium and plutonium. </p>
      <p>[0098]Many of the metals that can be recovered with embodiments
        of the disclosed method and system are metals that are capable
        of bonding to large numbers of ligands. Among these metals are
        lanthanides and actinides, such as uranium, gadolinium and
        plutonium. These metals typically form stable complexes with
        acid-base complexes, such as TBP-HNO.sub.3. Some metals that are
        not capable of bonding to large numbers of ligands can be
        extracted by adding a separate chelating agent to the
        extractant. These metals can be oxidized by the acid-base
        complex and then complexed with the chelating agent to become
        soluble in non-polar solvents, such as liquid or supercritical
        carbon dioxide. The stripping step and the stripping device
        discussed above can be modified to separate the metals from
        metal-containing complexes that include the chelating agent. </p>
      <p>[0099]Some of the metals that are not capable of binding to
        large numbers of ligands are noble metals, platinum group metals
        and coinage metals. Noble metals, in general, are metals that
        are resistant to oxidation. The noble metals are gold, silver,
        palladium, platinum, rhodium, rhodium, iridium, and osmium. The
        platinum group metals are platinum, palladium, iridium, rhodium,
        ruthenium and osmium. The coinage metals are copper, gold,
        nickel, silver and platinum. </p>
      <p>[0100]Some embodiments of the disclosed method and system are
        especially well suited for the recovery of uranium, gadolinium
        and plutonium from materials that contain one or more of these
        metals. These metals can be separated from each other during the
        stripping step, as discussed above, or recovered together and
        then separated from each other by subsequent liquid-liquid
        extractions, such as liquid-liquid extractions based on the
        relative affinity of the metals for TBP. </p>
      <p>[0101]The metal-containing material from which the metal is
        recovered can take many forms. In most cases, the material is
        solid, but it also can be liquid. Some examples of solid
        materials that contain uranium are incinerator ash, spent
        nuclear fuel, reactor parts from decommissioned nuclear power
        plants and noncombustible operational waste. The disclosed
        method and system can be applied to any of these materials, but
        some disclosed embodiments are specifically configured for
        recovering metals from incinerator ash. Incinerator ash is
        highly permeable and easily dividable into batches of
        approximately equal size. </p>
      <p>[0102]The disclosed method and system can be used on materials
        containing various concentrations of metals to be recovered.
        Some disclosed embodiments are especially well-suited for
        recovering metals present at relatively low concentrations, such
        as metals present at concentrations less than about 30% by
        weight, less than about 20% by weight or less than about 10% by
        weight. </p>
      <p><b>Liquid or Supercritical-Fluid Solvent</b> </p>
      <p>[0103]In embodiments of the disclosed method, the separation of
        metals occurs in a liquid or supercritical-fluid solvent.
        Supercritical-fluid solvents are especially useful because they
        have greater penetration power than liquid solvents. In some
        disclosed embodiments the solvent is a gas at room temperature
        and atmospheric pressure. These solvents are useful, in part,
        because they can be separated easily from the metal-containing
        complex by decreasing the pressure and/or increasing the
        temperature. These solvents also tend to be relatively inert and
        either non-toxic or less toxic than other solvents. </p>
      <p>[0104]Suitable solvents include, but are not limited to, carbon
        dioxide, nitrogen, nitrous oxide, methane, ethylene, propane and
        propylene. Carbon dioxide is a preferred solvent for both
        subcritical and supercritical fluid extractions because of its
        moderate chemical constants and its inertness. Carbon dioxide
        has a critical temperature of 31.degree. C. and a critical
        pressure of 73 atm. Supercritical carbon dioxide is
        non-explosive and thoroughly safe for extractions. Carbon
        dioxide also is a preferred solvent because it is abundantly
        available and relatively inexpensive. </p>
      <p>[0105]As mentioned above, supercritical solvents have certain
        advantages relative to liquid solvents, but liquid solvents
        still are suitable for many embodiments of the disclosed method.
        At room temperature, carbon dioxide becomes a liquid above 5.1
        atm. Depending on the pressure, liquid carbon dioxide has a
        density comparable to or slightly greater than the density of
        supercritical carbon dioxide. Thus, the solvation power of
        liquid carbon dioxide is comparable to or slightly greater than
        that of supercritical carbon dioxide. Liquid carbon dioxide is
        able to dissolve metal-containing complexes, but liquid carbon
        dioxide does not have the "gas-like" properties of supercritical
        carbon dioxide. Liquid carbon dioxide has a high viscosity, a
        low diffusivity, and consequently a poor penetration power
        compared to supercritical carbon dioxide. The extraction
        efficiency of liquid carbon dioxide may depend on the applied
        pressure. In addition, it may be possible to improve the
        extraction efficiency of liquid carbon dioxide by applying
        agitation, such as ultrasonic agitation. </p>
      <p>[0106]The liquid and supercritical fluid solvents used in
        embodiments of the disclosed method may be used individually or
        in combination. Examples of suitable solvents, and their
        critical temperatures and pressures, are shown in Table 1. </p>

      <p>[0107]In some embodiments of the disclosed method, a modifier
        can be added to the solvent to vary the characteristics thereof.
        For example, a modifier can be added to the solvent to enhance
        the solubility of a particular complexed metal. Some useful
        modifiers are low-to-medium boiling point alcohols and esters,
        such as lower alkyl alcohols and esters. As used herein, the
        term "lower alkyl" refers to compounds having ten or fewer
        carbon atoms, and includes both straight-chain and
        branched-chain compounds and all stereoisomers. Typical
        modifiers can be selected from the group consisting of methanol,
        ethanol, ethyl acetate, and combinations thereof. The modifiers
        are added to the solvent in an amount sufficient to vary the
        characteristics thereof. This can be an amount, for example,
        between about 0.1% and about 20% by weight. The modifiers
        contemplated for use with embodiments of the disclosed method
        most typically are not supercritical fluids at the disclosed
        operating conditions. Rather, the modifiers simply are dissolved
        in the solvents to improve their solvent properties. </p>
      <p><b>Oxidizing Agent</b> </p>
      <p>[0108]In some disclosed embodiments, the metal is oxidized with
        an oxidizing agent during the extraction step. For example,
        uranium dioxide in the +4 oxidation state does not form stable
        complexes with most commonly known chelating agents. Thus, it
        can be useful to use an oxidizing agent to convert uranium
        dioxide to the +6 oxidation state, which does form stable
        complexes with a number of complexing agents, including
        complexing agents, such as TBP, that are soluble in
        supercritical carbon dioxide. </p>
      <p>[0109]Suitable oxidizing agents include Lewis acids,
        Bronsted-Lowry acids, mineral acids, and combinations thereof.
        Many of the useful oxidizing agents are non-organic acids.
        Specific examples include, but are not limited to, nitric acid,
        sulfuric acid and hydrogen peroxide. The oxidizing agent also
        can be a non-acid oxidizing agent. In some disclosed
        embodiments, the oxidizing agent is a compound that, after
        oxidizing the metal, is converted into products that are easily
        separable from the metal being extracted. For example, in some
        disclosed embodiments, the oxidizing agent is selected to break
        down into volatile and/or soluble products after oxidizing the
        metal. The oxidizing agent also can be selected to break down
        into compounds that are gases at room temperature and
        atmospheric pressure and/or water after oxidizing the metal. </p>
      <p><b>Complexing Agent</b> </p>
      <p>[0110]Without the presence of a complexing agent, many
        oxidizing agents, such as nitric acid, are insoluble in
        non-polar solvents, such as supercritical carbon dioxide.
        Complexing agents can be combined with the oxidizing agents to
        form acid-base complexes that are soluble in non-polar solvents.
        For example, the solubility of the oxidizing agent in
        supercritical carbon dioxide can be increased from less than
        about 0.1 moles per liter at 50.degree. C. and 100 atm to
        greater than about 0.5 moles per liter at 50.degree. C. and 100
        atm by combining the oxidizing agent with a complexing agent to
        form an acid-base complex. </p>
      <p>[0111]Suitable complexing agents to be paired with the
        oxidizing agents include Lewis bases, Bronsted-Lowry bases, and
        combinations thereof. Complexing agents that are well suited for
        use with the disclosed method include Lewis bases soluble in
        supercritical carbon dioxide, and combinations thereof. Examples
        include, but are not limited to, alkyl phosphates, including
        tri-alkyl phosphates, such as TBP, as well as alkylphosphine
        oxides, including tri-alkylphosphine oxides, such as TOPO. The
        complexing agent also can be a non-basic complexing agent that
        is nevertheless capable of forming a complex with an oxidizing
        agent. </p>
      <p><b>Acid-Base Complex</b> </p>
      <p>[0112]As mentioned above, the oxidizing agent and complexing
        agent can be introduced into the solvent as an acid-base
        complex. An oxidizing agent, such as nitric acid, can be
        combined with a complexing agent, such as TBP, to form an
        acid-base complex that is soluble in non-polar solvents, such as
        supercritical carbon dioxide. The oxidizing agent typically is
        the acid component of the acid-base complex, while the
        complexing agent typically is the base component of the
        acid-base complex. </p>
      <p>[0113]TBP-HNO.sub.3 can be prepared, for example, by mixing TBP
        with a concentrated nitric acid solution. Nitric acid dissolves
        in the TBP phase forming a Lewis acid-base complex of the
        general formula TBP(HNO.sub.3).sub.x(H.sub.2O).sub.y, which is
        separable from the remaining aqueous phase. The x and y values
        depend on the relative amount of TBP and nitric acid used in the
        preparation. TBP-HNO.sub.3 complexes of different x and y values
        have been characterized by conventional titration methods as
        well as by proton NMR spectroscopy. Higher x values correspond
        to increased oxidation strength. In some disclosed embodiments x
        is greater than or equal to about 0.7 and y is less than or
        equal to about 0.7. </p>
      <p><b>Chelating Agent</b> </p>
      <p>[0114]For the extraction of certain metals it can be useful to
        incorporate a chelating agent into the extractant. The chelating
        agent can be selected to solubilize the metal in the solvent
        after the metal has been oxidized. The use of a chelating agent
        different than the acid-base complex can be useful for the
        recovery of metals that do not form stable complexes with the
        acid-base complex. Beneficial factors to consider in the
        selection of chelating agents include, but are not limited to,
        high stability constants of the metal-containing complex formed,
        fast complexation kinetics, good solubility in the solvent for
        both the chelating agent and the metal-containing complex
        formed, and sufficient specificity to allow selective extraction
        of a metal or a group of metal ions. </p>
      <p>[0115]Without limitation, chelating agents for practicing
        embodiments of the disclosed method include .beta.-diketones,
        phosphine oxides (such as trialkylphosphine oxides,
        triarylphosphine oxides, and alkylarylphosphine oxides),
        phosphinic acids, carboxylic acids, phosphates (such as
        trialkylphosphates, triarylphosphates, and alkylarylphosphates),
        crown ethers, dithiocarbamates, phosphine sulfides,
        phosphorothioic acids, thiophosphinic acids, halogenated analogs
        of these chelating agents, and mixtures of these chelating
        agents. Some of the useful chelating agents have lower alkyl
        functional groups. Alkyl-substituted chelating agents with chain
        lengths of about eight carbons, especially branched-chain alkyl
        groups, are characterized by high solubilities in supercritical
        carbon dioxide. </p>
      <p>[0116]A partial list of examples of chelating agents useful for
        solubilizing metals in non-polar solvents is provided in Table

      <p><b>Stripping Agent</b> </p>
      <p>[0117]The stripping agent can be any liquid that has a higher
        affinity for the metal than the phase including the complexing
        agent. Metal ions typically have a higher solubility in an
        aqueous phase than in an organic phase. Therefore, in some
        disclosed embodiments, the stripping agent is aqueous. Water can
        be an effective stripping agent for removing metals, such as
        uranium, from the phase including the complexing agent, such as
        TBP. Other polar molecules in liquid form, such as alcohols,
        also may be suitable stripping agents. </p>
      <p>[0118]In selecting a stripping agent, it can be useful to
        consider the processing required to convert the metal within the
        striping agent into a final product. In the recovery of uranium,
        for example, using water as the stripping agent can result in
        the formation of a uranyl solution, such as a uranyl nitrate
        solution. This solution then can be converted directly into
        UO.sub.2. </p>
      <p><b>Operating Conditions</b> </p>
      <p>[0119]The operating conditions for the extraction step
        typically depend on the properties of the solvent, such as the
        critical temperature and the critical pressure for the solvent.
        The extraction can be, for example, carried out at a temperature
        and pressure greater than the triple point for the solvent or
        greater than the critical point for the solvent. The appropriate
        temperature and pressure depend on whether the solvent is
        maintained as a liquid or as a supercritical fluid. In
        extractions in which the solvent is carbon dioxide and the
        solvent is maintained as a liquid, the temperature and pressure
        can be, for example, any temperature and pressure combination in
        the liquid region of the carbon dioxide phase diagram shown in
        FIG. 1. If the solvent is maintained as a supercritical fluid,
        the temperature and pressure can be, for example, any
        temperature and pressure greater than the temperature and
        pressure at the critical point of the carbon dioxide phase
        diagram shown in FIG. 1. </p>
      <p>[0120]As with the extraction step, the operating conditions for
        the stripping step typically depend on the properties of the
        solvent. Any of the temperature and pressure combinations
        disclosed for the extraction step also can be applied to the
        stripping step. In some disclosed embodiments, the stripping
        step does not benefit significantly from the improved
        penetration power of supercritical fluids so the solvent is
        maintained in liquid form. </p>
      <p>[0121]The operating conditions can affect the rates of certain
        reactions in the disclosed method, such as the rate at which the
        metal is oxidized, the rate at which the metal is complexed and
        the rate at which the metal is stripped from the
        metal-containing complex. In general, higher pressures make the
        solvent denser, which tends to increase the rate of reactions
        occurring within the solvent. Higher temperatures also tend to
        increase the rate of these reactions. Therefore, in order to
        increase reaction rates, some embodiments of the disclosed
        method are performed at temperatures and pressures higher than
        the temperatures and pressures required to maintain the solvent
        in the desired phase. Temperature and pressure are interrelated,
        so using increased temperatures, for example, may necessitate
        the use of increased pressures to maintain the solvent in the
        desired phase and at the desired density. </p>
      <p><b>EXAMPLES</b> </p>
      <p>[0122]The following examples are provided to illustrate certain
        particular embodiments of the disclosure. Additional embodiments
        not limited to the particular features described are consistent
        with the following examples. </p>
      <p><b>Example 1</b> </p>
      <p>[0123]This example describes several laboratory trials that
        were performed to study the effect of process conditions on the
        mass transfer of the metal in the stripping step. In these
        trials, the metal was uranium, the complexing agent was TBP, the
        oxidizing agent was nitric acid and the stripping agent was
        water. Tables 3-7 show the concentrations of uranium and nitric
        acid before stripping as well as the concentrations of uranium
        and nitric acid in the organic and aqueous phases after
        stripping. Each table shows the results of one or more trials
        performed at a given temperature, pressure and ratio of TBP to
        water. Two values for each of these variables were tested, with
        each table showing the data for trials performed at a different
        combination of values. Comparing the data between the tables
        indicates the effect of each variable on the mass transfer.
        Within each table, the individual trials represent different
        starting concentrations of uranium and nitric acid. </p>

      <p>[0124]The data in Tables 3-7 show that a greater percentage of
        uranium is stripped when the initial concentration of uranium is
        higher (e.g., greater than about 100 g/L, about 150 g/L or about
        200 g/L) and when the initial concentration of nitric acid is
        lower (e.g., less than about 5 mol/L, about 3 mol/L or about 1
        mol/L). The efficiency of the extraction step prior to the
        stripping step, however, typically is improved by a higher
        concentration of nitric acid in the extractant. Therefore, it
        may be necessary to balance the positive effect of nitric acid
        on the extraction step with the negative effect of nitric acid
        on the stripping step. </p>
      <p><b>Example 2</b> </p>
      <p>[0125]This example describes one embodiment of the disclosed
        system. FIGS. 5-8 illustrate this embodiment in detail. FIG. 5
        is a simplified schematic of the system. FIGS. 6A and 6B are a

        the labels for certain elements in FIGS. 6-8: level control
        valve (LCV), pressure control valve (PCV), pump (P), safety
        valve (SV), and tank (TK). The labels for the remaining elements
        of the system are coded as shown in Table 8. </p>

      <p>[0126]A TBP-HNO.sub.3-water solution of the form <br>
        TBP.(HNO.sub.3).sub.1.8.(H.sub.2O).sub.0.6 will be made up in
        TK-2 using recycled TBP and fresh 70% (15.6 M) nitric acid. The
        excess water from the HNO.sub.3 will be skimmed from the makeup
        tank and recycled or sent to disposal. Alternatively, the TBP
        solution can be made up in a hood in glassware and poured into
        TK-2. The TBP-HNO.sub.3-water solution will be pumped from TK-2
        and mixed with CO.sub.2 in a static mixer to form the
        extractant, which will be fed to the dissolvers. The extractant
        flow rate will be monitored by flow meter FI-201. The CO.sub.2
        flow rate to the dissolvers will be measured by flow meter
        FI-101. The TBP-HNO.sub.3 flow rate can be determined by
        measuring the rate of level drop in TK-2. </p>
      <p>[0127]Incinerator ash will be placed into inner containers and
        loaded into the dissolver vessels, TK-4A and 4B. The inner
        containers will have a sintered metal filter bottom to contain
        the ash. The TBP-HNO.sub.3--CO.sub.2 extractant will be fed from
        the top down through the stationary ash. At the end of the
        cycle, the flow of extractant will be shut off briefly, allowing
        the dissolvers to be flushed with pure CO.sub.2. After each
        cycle, TK-4B will receive a fresh batch of ash and TK-4A will
        receive a batch of ash that has had one extraction performed on
        it in TK-4B. </p>
      <p>[0128]As the extractant is fed through the dissolvers to the
        CO.sub.2 separator tank TK-8, the pressure in the dissolvers
        will be monitored and controlled at 200 bar by pressure
        transmitter PT-401 and valve PCV-401. The dissolvers will
        operate at a temperature of approximately 60.degree. C.
        Temperature will be controlled in the dissolvers by external
        heaters. </p>
      <p>[0129]CO.sub.2 will be removed from the extractant-uranium
        mixture and collected in the CO.sub.2-TBP separator tank TK-8.
        At the end of each cycle, the solution will be gravity drained
        from TK-8 to the TBP-UNH tank TK-3. Approximately five dissolver
        batches will be collected in TK-3 before running the stripping
        column. Alternately, for tests on the stripping column, a
        TBP-HNO.sub.3-uranium solution can be made up in TK-3. </p>
      <p>[0130]Uranium and nitric acid will be removed from the
        extractant with water in a two-phase countercurrent flow column,
        V-6. Water will be fed into the column near the top of the
        column and the TBP-HNO.sub.3-uranium mixture will be pumped from
        TK-3 and mixed with CO.sub.2 in a static mixer before entering
        the bottom of the column. The TBP-HNO.sub.3-uranium mixture flow
        rate will be monitored by flow meter FI-301. The CO.sub.2 flow
        rate will be monitored by flow meter FT-102. The column pressure
        will be maintained at 200 bar by pressure transmitter PT-602 and
        valve PCV-601. </p>
      <p>[0131]Deionized water will be pumped from TK-7 to the top of
        the column and injected via a nozzle to disperse the water as
        droplets into the continuous TBP-CO.sub.2 phase. The water
        droplets will extract the uranium and nitric acid and will
        coalesce and be removed at the bottom of the column as uranyl
        nitrate solution. An interface between the two phases will be
        maintained near the bottom of the column by level control switch
        LS-601 and discharge valve LCV-601. The water flow rate will be
        monitored by flow meter FI-701. The water flow rate also can be
        determined by measuring the level decrease rate in TK-7. Column
        temperature will be controlled by an external heater. The
        operating temperature is expected to be 50.degree. C. Uranyl
        nitrate solution will be collected in UNH tank TK-5. </p>
      <p>[0132]The CO.sub.2-TBP mixture exiting the top of the column
        will be sent to the CO.sub.2-TBP separator, TK-8. TK-8 will be
        sized to collect the entire volume of a stripping column batch.
        Recovered TBP will be recycled to the ash dissolver tank TK-1
        where additional HNO.sub.3 will be added to replace the
        HNO.sub.3 consumed in the extraction. </p>
      <p>[0133]For safety, rupture disks will be provided on the ash
        dissolvers TK-4A and TK-4B and on the stripping column V-6. A
        room CO.sub.2 monitor will be attached to an audible alarm and a
        flashing light. </p>
      <p>[0134]The system shown in FIGS. 5-8 was modeled to study its
        anticipated performance. For the purpose of this modeling,
        perfect stripping of U, HNO.sub.3, and H.sub.2O from
        TBP-CO.sub.2 and perfect separation of TBP from CO.sub.2 was
        assumed. The basis for the modeling is shown in Table 9. </p>

      <p><b>Example 3</b> </p>
      <p>[0136]This example provides a comparison of uranium recovery by
        one embodiment of the disclosed process and uranium recovery by
        the PUREX process. Table 14 shows the initial concentration of
        nitric acid in the aqueous phase, the final concentration of
        uranium in the aqueous phase and the distribution ratio achieved
        in four trials modeling one embodiment of the disclosed process.
        The distribution ratios are equal to the concentration of
        uranium in the organic phase by weight divided by the
        concentration of uranium in the aqueous phase by weight. For the
        trials shown in Table 14, the uranium was extracted in
        supercritical carbon dioxide at 200 bar and 50.degree. C. The
        ratio of TBP to water in the stripping step was 1.0. </p>

      <p>[0138]By comparing the data in Table 14 with the data in Table
        15, it is clear that the tested embodiment of the disclosed
        process is generally similar in performance to the PUREX
        process. The similarities suggest that the nitric acid
        concentrations used in the PUREX process to separate uranium
        from other metals also may work with the disclosed process for
        the same purpose. In the PUREX process, with a 2 to 3 molar free
        HNO.sub.3 concentration in the aqueous phase, most of the
        uranium enters the organic phase while nearly all of the
        gadolinium remains in the aqueous phase. It follows, therefore,
        that, in the stripping step of the disclosed process, gadolinium
        will enter the aqueous phase and leave the uranium behind in the
        organic phase when the nitric acid concentration in the aqueous
        phase is 2 to 3 molar. </p>
      <p><b>Example 4</b> </p>
      <p>[0139]This example describes a laboratory trial that was
        performed to test gadolinium stripping from a supercritical
        carbon dioxide phase. The apparatus used for this experiment is
        illustrated in FIG. 9. The apparatus 120 comprises a carbon
        dioxide supply 122, a pump 124, a first cell 126, a second cell
        128, a third cell 130 and a collection vial 132. The flow
        between these elements is controlled by a first valve 134, a
        second valve 136, a third valve 138, a fourth valve 140 and a
        fifth valve 142. </p>
      <p>[0140]About 1.5 mL of TBP(HNO.sub.3).sub.1.8(H.sub.2O).sub.0.6
        was placed in the first cell 126 and a solid sample of
        Gd.sub.2O.sub.3 (100 mg) was placed in the second cell 128.
        Supercritical carbon dioxide at 40.degree. C. and 150 atm was
        passed into the first cell 126 and then into second cell 128 to
        dissolve the Gd.sub.2O.sub.3. The resulting supercritical fluid
        solution containing dissolved gadolinium was then fed into the
        third cell 130, which contained 20 mL of a 2.2 M nitric acid
        solution. The supercritical fluid phase and the aqueous nitric
        acid phase were stirred with a magnetic bar for 60 minutes with
        the fourth valve 140 and the fifth valve 142 closed. After this,
        the fifth valve 142 was opened to release the supercritical
        fluid phase into the collection vial 132 along with 20 mL of
        water under ambient pressure. The remaining nitric acid solution
        was removed from the third cell 130 after the trial. </p>
      <p>[0141]The concentrations of gadolinium in the nitric acid
        solution and in the water of the collection vial were measured
        by ICP-MS. The ratio of gadolinium in the nitric acid solution
        to gadolinium in the water of the collection vial was assumed to
        be the distribution ratio of Gd between the nitric acid phase
        and the supercritical carbon dioxide phase at 40.degree. C. and
        150 atm. The experimental ratio of the concentration of
        gadolinium in the nitric acid phase to the concentration of
        gadolinium in the supercritical carbon dioxide phase was about
        50. This result further establishes that gadolinium can be
        separated from uranium in a supercritical carbon dioxide
        solution using the disclosed counter-current column stripping
        method. </p>

      <p><b>Description</b> </p>
      <p><b>FIELD</b> </p>
      <p>The present disclosure concerns extracting metals and/or
        metalloids from a material, such as a solid or liquid,
        particularly using supercritical fluid extraction. </p>
      <p><b>BACKGROUND</b> </p>
      <p>Metals typically are extracted from raw materials, such as
        metal oxides, and thereafter separated from other materials
        either used for or generated by the extraction process. Solvent
        extraction at atmospheric pressure following dissolution of
        solids with an acid is a widely used technique for extracting
        metals and metal oxides from solid materials. However,
        conventional acid dissolution followed by solvent extraction
        processes requires large amounts of solvents and acids. Those
        same solvents and acids often become waste, and waste treatment
        and disposal presents an important environmental problem,
        particularly for radioactive solid wastes. Removing radioactive
        materials and metal contaminants from wastes generated by mines
        and nuclear plants would facilitate safer and cheaper disposal
        of the remaining waste products. Current methods for
        decontaminating such wastes are infeasible on an industrial
        scale because of the large quantity of secondary acid and
        solvent waste generated by such methods. </p>
      <p>Recently, supercritical fluids comprising a chelating agent
        have been proposed for chelation and dissolution of metals and
        metal oxides without the use of either organic solvents or
        aqueous solutions. Various features of supercritical fluid
        extraction of metals and metalloids are disclosed in Dr. Chien
        Wai et al.'s U.S. Pat., Nos. 5,356,538, 5,606,724, 5,730,874,
        5,770,085, 5,792,357, 5,965,025, 5,840,193, 6,132,491 and
        6,187,911 ("Wai's patents"). Wai's patents are incorporated
        herein by reference. Wai's patents disclose various features for
        extracting metalloid and metal ions from materials by exposing
        the materials to a fluid solvent, particularly supercritical
        carbon dioxide, containing a chelating agent. </p>
      <p>Despite these prior known processes, there are still some
        disadvantages associated with these and other more traditional
        purification processes for metals, such as uranium. These
        disadvantages include: (a) low yields of purified metals and low
        overall efficiency; (b) time consuming steps; (c) the creation
        of undesirable waste streams; and (d) slow extraction rates. </p>
      <p>A need therefore exists for an environmentally safe method for
        separating and/or purifying metals from other metals, metalloids
        and/or impurities. A further need exists for a method which is
        both efficient and provides for a greater yield of the extracted
        and purified metals. </p>
      <p><b>SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</b> </p>
      <p>Disclosed embodiments of the present method are useful for
        extracting metals and metalloids, especially lanthanides,
        actinides, transition metals, platinum group metals, and their
        oxides, from a solid or a liquid by exposing the solid or liquid
        to an acid extractant composition, such as an aqueous acid
        extractant composition particularly forming emulsions or
        microemulsions, in a supercritical fluid solvent. Aqueous acid
        emulsions alone are effective for extracting metals and
        metalloids into supercritical carbon dioxide ("SF-CO.sub.2").
        This likely is because the specific surface area per unit volume
        of the emulsion is quite large. Forming a complex, especially an
        aqueous complex, of an acid with a chelating agent for use as
        the extractant was particularly effective. The acid and
        chelating agent are typically a Lewis acid and a Lewis base,
        respectively. </p>
      <p>Moreover, using ultrasound in combination with an extractant
        substantially enhances the rate and the efficiency of the
        extraction process. This is likely true for at least two
        reasons: (1) ultrasound maintains the emulsion or microemulsion,
        i.e., it reduces the rate at which the droplets of the emulsion
        coalesce, and (2) the ultrasound facilitates mass transport,
        i.e., it helps move the solubilized metal or metalloid species
        into the supercritical fluid phase, away from the liquid or
        solid phase surface. </p>
      <p>Disclosed embodiments of the present method are particularly
        useful for dissolving or extracting uranium dioxide-containing
        materials in SF-CO.sub.2. As such, they may be particularly
        suited to reprocessing spent nuclear fuels and for treating
        certain nuclear wastes. Indeed, the disclosed method for
        ultrasound-aided SF-CO.sub.2 dissolution has important
        applications for recovering uranium from UO.sub.2 trapped in
        narrow spaces, such as in natural soil, sintered materials, and
        locally rough surfaces. Moreover, disclosed embodiments of the
        present method may be used to recover platinum, palladium and
        other metals from waste materials, such as used catalytic
        converters. </p>
      <p><b>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</b> </p>
      <p><b>FIG. 1</b> is a schematic diagram of a system for UO.sub.2
        dissolution in SF-CO.sub.2 where the system contains a CO.sub.2
        cylinder, syringe pump, ligand cell, sample cell, ultrasound
        device with a water bath, T-shaped joints, collection vial, and
        heater for the poly(ether ether ketone) (PEEK) restrictor. </p>
      <p><b>FIG. 2</b> is a graph of the percent uranium extracted from
        the sample cell versus time in minutes which contrasts the rate
        of UO.sub.2 dissolution in SF-CO.sub.2 containing
        TBP/HNO.sub.3/H.sub.2O at 323 K and 15 MPa with and without the
        application of ultrasound. The sample initially contained 21 mg
        of UO.sub.2. All fitted curves were obtained by the
        least-squares method and approached 100% recovery. </p>
      <p><b>FIG. 3</b> is a graph of the amount of uranium recovered
        from the sample cell in milligrams versus time in minutes and

      <p><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF SEVERAL EMBODIMENTS</b> </p>
      <p>The following definitions are provided solely to aid the
        reader, and such definitions should not be construed to indicate
        a term scope less than that understood by a person of ordinary
        skill in the art. </p>
      <p>"Emulsion" or "microemulsion" refers to the high-surface-area,
        immiscible dispersion of an extractant and/or a fluid-soluble
        complex in a solvent. More particularly, such a dispersion can
        result from the anti-solvent effect of the solvent or
        supercritical solvent for the aqueous Lewis acid or other
        hydrophilic/polar component associated with the fluid-soluble
        complex. A microemulsion is a term understood by a person of
        skill in the art but, without limitation, as used herein
        typically refers to a two-phase system wherein the droplet
        diameter is typically less than one micron, and, more often,
        approximately 100 nm or less. </p>
      <p>"Extractant" refers to a material or mixture of materials
        useful for extracting a metal or metalloid species. It
        particularly refers to a fluid-soluble complex capable of
        reacting with, e.g., oxidizing and/or complexing with, the
        material to be extracted to form another complex containing the
        material to be extracted and also is CO.sub.2-soluble. </p>
      <p>"Fluid-soluble complex" refers to the combination of a Lewis
        acid with a Lewis base to form a complex that is at least
        partially soluble in CO.sub.2, SF-CO.sub.2, or another
        hydrophobic or substantially nonpolar solvent. </p>
      <p>"HTTA" refers to 4, 4-trifluoro-1-(2-thienyl)-1, 3-butanedione.
      </p>
      <p>"Lower alkyl" refers to compounds having ten or fewer carbon
        atoms, and includes both straight-chain and branched-chain
        compounds and all stereoisomers. </p>
      <p>"Supercritical fluid" includes substances at supercritical
        conditions. Specifically, such fluids may include SF-CO.sub.2
        and SF-Ar (or any other supercritical noble gas). </p>
      <p>"SF-Ar" refers to argon under conditions such that it is a
        supercritical fluid. </p>
      <p>"SF-CO.sub.2" refers to carbon dioxide under conditions such
        that it is a supercritical fluid. </p>
      <p>"TBP" refers to tri-n-butylphosphate. </p>
      <p>"TBP/HNO.sub.3/H.sub.2O " refers to complexes formed from TBP
        and concentrated HNO.sub.3 where the molar ratio of TBP to
        HNO.sub.3 to H.sub.2O may vary. </p>
      <p>"Ultrasound," "ultrasonic," and "ultrasonic vibrations"
        typically refer to vibrations or sound waves primarily of a
        higher frequency than that which can be detected by the normal
        human ear. As used herein, the application of "ultrasonic
        vibrations" or "ultrasound" is the same as "sonication" and
        these terms are used interchangeably. Such sound waves often
        include frequencies from about 10,000 Hz to about 500 MHz,
        typically frequencies from about 20,000 Hz to about 100,000 Hz,
        and even more typically from about 40,000 Hz to about 50,000 Hz,
        with many embodiments using an ultrasound frequency of about
        45,000 Hz. </p>
      <p>The disclosed embodiments of the present method generally
        involve forming a mixture of an extractant composition or
        emulsion, particularly aqueous acid extractant compositions, and
        a supercritical fluid. The extractant compositions may be
        prepared by complexing a chelating agent with any aqueous Lewis
        acid, any mineral acid, or any organic acid so long as that acid
        is capable of reacting with, such as by oxidizing the metal or
        metalloid to be extracted, or otherwise forming a species that
        can be extracted into the supercritical fluid phase when the
        acid contacts the metal or metalloid. The chelating agent is a
        Lewis base that can combine with the Lewis acid to form an
        extractant complex that is at least partially soluble in the
        supercritical fluid because of the high solubility of the
        chelating agent in the supercritical fluid. Although not bound
        by any theory expressed herein, contacting the extractant
        composition with a supercritical fluid is believed to produce an
        aqueous acid emulsion or microemulsion due to the low solubility
        of water in the supercritical fluid. The extractant composition
        is dispersed in the supercritical fluid. </p>
      <p>It is believed that the Lewis base is not essential to the
        method as described in detail herein. The method can be used
        with any combination of a Lewis acid and a surfactant or other
        material that can transport the acid in micelles or emulsified
        droplets in the supercritical fluid phase. In that way, the acid
        can be dispersed throughout the supercritical fluid phase in
        very small "droplets" or micelles resulting in a high surface
        area for dissolution of a metal or metalloid species. </p>
      <p>In either case, subjecting the material/supercritical fluid
        extractant system to ultrasound substantially increases the rate
        of dissolution of the metal/metalloid. As the data described
        herein demonstrates, and specifically referring to FIG. 7, the
        rate of dissolution typically at least doubles with the
        application of ultrasound. The total amounts of material
        extracted also are significantly enhanced using ultrasound,
        typically by at least an order of magnitude above amounts
        extracted without the application of ultrasound. Thus, applying
        ultrasonic vibrations to the extractant mixtures, particularly
        emulsions or microemulsions, provides for rapid and highly
        efficient dissolution of metals/metalloids. </p>
      <p>Sonication significantly improves the dissolution of UO.sub.2
        in supercritical fluids, such as SF-CO.sub.2, using an
        extractant, such as TBP/HNO.sub.3/H.sub.2O because oxidation and
        diffusion processes are involved in the dissolution. Without
        being bound by any theory of operation, it is believed that a
        significant portion of emulsified extractant droplets are
        sufficiently small to be substantially uniformly dispersed
        throughout the supercritical fluid. Moreover, applying
        ultrasound during dissolution likely facilitates the transport
        and dispersion of the emulsified droplets throughout the
        mixture, thereby providing an effectively increased surface area
        for reaction with the material to be extracted. Ultrasonic
        vibrations can be applied at many different combinations of
        frequency, intensity, and amplitude in practicing this method.
        Sonic vibrations (&lt;10,000 Hz) also may effectively maintain
        the extractant emulsion described herein. </p>
      <p>Contacting a material that includes a metal and/or metalloid
        species with the acid extractant composition can oxidize the
        metal and/or metalloid species. The resulting oxidized metal
        and/or metalloid species complexes with the chelating agent to
        form an intermediate complex that is highly soluble in the
        supercritical fluid phase. Alternatively, a metal and/or
        metalloid species can directly complex with the extractant. In
        either case, the emulsion droplets provide a high surface area
        resulting in efficient extraction. The dissolved intermediate
        complex can be separated from the supercritical fluid by known
        techniques as described below. </p>
      <p>The specific instance of aqueous nitric acid (HNO.sub.3) as the
        Lewis acid, tri-n-butylphosphate (TBP) as the chelating agent,
        SF-CO.sub.2 as the solvent, and uranium dioxide (UO.sub.2) as
        the metal species constitutes one embodiment of the present
        method. Other embodiments utilize as the Lewis acid any organic
        or inorganic acid sufficiently strong to react with the species
        to be extracted; any trialkyl, triaryl, or alkyl-aryl
        substituted phosphate or phosphine oxide, any substituted
        phosphinic or phosphonic acid, any .beta.-diketone, any
        dithiocarbamate, any ionizable crown ether, and mixtures thereof
        as the Lewis base/chelating agent; any supercritical fluid as a
        solvent; and any lanthanide, actinide, transition metal,
        metalloid, platinum group metal or metal species as the
        extracted material. See Table 1 for specific examples. </p>
      <p>The molar ratio of the Lewis acid to the Lewis base may vary,
        as may the molecular ratio of water in the fluid-soluble
        complex. The extractant emulsion "droplets" may themselves
        contain excess unbound Lewis acid or water molecules. However,
        there are certain advantages in minimizing the water used in the
        disclosed embodiments, including easing the separation of the
        metal/metalloid containing complex and minimizing the waste
        solvent stream of the processes. </p>
      <p>A surfactant or mixtures of surfactants may be used to
        stabilize the extractant emulsion, if required. Illustrative
        suitable surfactants include sodium bis(2-ethylhexyl)
        sulfosuccinate ("AOT"), fluorinated AOT, ionic surfactants with
        fluorinated tails such as perfluoropolyether ("PFPE") tails, and
        octyl phenol ethoxylate. Examples of surfactants with PFPE tails
        include PFPE-phosphate (average molecular weight of about 870
        g/mol) and PFPE-ammonium carboxylate (average molecular weight
        of about 740 g/mol). </p>
      <p>The resulting metal, metalloid, or metal oxide complex is
        readily isolated. For example, the system pressure, i.e., the
        pressure of the supercritical fluid, can be reduced below the
        critical point, e.g., to approximately atmospheric pressure, and
        the gas expanded into a collection container. The then gaseous
        form of the material that was the supercritical fluid may be
        reused, including recycling it back through the disclosed
        extraction processes. Any reduction of the pressure of the
        supercritical fluid below supercritical levels facilitates
        precipitation of the metal or metal oxide complexes. The metal
        or metalloid species then can be separated from the Lewis
        acid/Lewis base complex by any number of known methods,
        including treatment with concentrated nitric acid. </p>

        purposes and should not be considered as limiting the scope of
        the appended claims. </p>
      <p><b>Example 1</b> </p>
      <p><b>Ultrasound-Enhanced Dissolution of UO.sub.2</b> </p>
      <p>A particular embodiment of an improved metal dissolution
        technique is as follows and described in Enokida et al.,
        "Ultrasound-Enhanced Dissolution of UO.sub.2 in Supercritical
        CO.sub.2 Containing a CO.sub.2-Philic Complexant of
        Tri-n-butylphosphate and Nitric Acid," Ind. Eng. Chem. Res.
        2002, 41(9), 2282 2286, which is incorporated herein by
        reference. </p>
      <p>In the system described below, the TBP/HNO.sub.3/H.sub.2O
        complex probably extracts UO.sub.2 by oxidation of U(IV) in
        solid UO.sub.2 to U(VI), forming UO.sub.2.sup.2+, followed by
        the formation of UO.sub.2(NO.sub.3).sub.2.2TBP in SF-CO.sub.2.
        UO.sub.2(NO.sub.3).sub.2.2TBP is highly soluble in SF -CO.sub.2,
        exceeding 0.45 mol L.sup.-1 in CO.sub.2 at 313 K and 20 MPa. It
        is the most soluble metal complex in SF-CO.sub.2 reported in the
        literature thus far. </p>
      <p>The supercritical fluid system is illustrated in FIG. 1. As
        described further below, this system, and that shown in FIG. 5,
        functioned both as a dynamic extractor and a static extractor.
        Pressurized CO.sub.2 (99.9%, Praxair, San Carlos, Calif.) was
        introduced from a cylinder 10 to the system via line 12, valve
        14, line 16, syringe pump 18 (model 260D with a series D
        controller ISCO Inc., Lincoln, Nebr.) and line 20 to T-joint 24.
        Lines 22, 26, 32, 34, 40, 46, 50, 54, 58 and valves 28, 30, 42,
        52 were used to control and direct the flow through the
        remainder of the system. An ultrasonic cleaner, i.e., an
        ultrasound emitting device, 36 (Fisher Scientific FS30,
        Pittsburgh, Pa.) with a heater was used as an ultrasound and
        heat source. Two different stainless steel cells were used, a
        6.94-mL cell 38 for the extractant (i.e., TBP/HNO.sub.3/H.sub.2O
        in SF-CO.sub.2) and a 3.74-mL cell 48 for the UO.sub.2
        dissolution. The volumes were measured gravimetrically using
        water. A restrictor made of poly(ether ether ketone) (PEEK) 56
        with 0.005 in. i.d. was used for sample collection. </p>
      <p>Before dynamic extraction, the ligand cell 38 (upstream of the
        sample cell 48) was kept in a static mode for 10 minutes to
        allow complete mixing of the TBP/HNO.sub.3/H.sub.2O with
        SF-CO.sub.2 by application of ultrasound at about 25 80 kHz. The
        sample cell 48, functioning as a supercritical fluid extraction
        vessel, was pressurized to the same pressure as the ligand cell
        38 with SF-CO.sub.2 by way of the T-joint 44. The dynamic
        extraction process was initiated by opening valve 42 separating
        the two cells, as well as the inlet 28 and outlet 52 valves
        shown in FIG. 1. Samples were collected in collection vial 60 at
        2 minute intervals in chloroform (density=1.472 g mL.sup.-1) or
        in n-dodecane (density=0.749 g mL.sup.-1) during a dynamic
        extraction of 20 minutes. </p>
      <p>The flow rate of the supercritical fluid was between 0.5 and
        0.8 mL min.sup.-1. To increase the surface area of the sample, 5
        g of granular glass beads (60 80 mesh; density=2.3 g mL.sup.-1)
        were mixed with a certain amount (21 or 7.2 mg) of UO.sub.2
        (Alfa Division, Danvers, Mass.). The coated beads were placed in
        dissolution cell 48. For each extraction, 3 mL of a
        TBP/HNO.sub.3/H.sub.2O complex was used as the extractant. </p>
      <p>Back extraction was performed by shaking the collected sample
        (in 7 mL of chloroform or n-dodecane) with 3 mL of deionized
        water for 3 minutes, followed by twice washing the organic phase
        with 3 mL of deionized water. The combined aqueous phase was
        collected in a 10 mL volumetric flask. The pH of the aqueous
        solution was measured with a pH meter (Orion model 701A,
        Cambridge, Mass.), and the uranium content was analyzed
        spectrophotometrically with Arsenazo-I at a wavelength of 594
        nm. Absorption spectra were measured and recorded using a UV-Vis
        spectrophotometer (Cary 1E, Varian Inc., Palo Alto, Calif.). </p>
      <p>The TBP/HNO.sub.3/H.sub.2O extractant was prepared by adding 5
        mL of TBP (density=0.979 g mL.sup.-1) with different volumes of
        concentrated nitric acid (69.5%; density=1.42 g mL.sup.-1 or
        15.5 mol L.sup.-1) in a glass tube with a stopper. The mixture
        was shaken vigorously on a wrist action mechanical shaker for 5
        minutes followed by centrifuging for 2 hours. After
        centrifugation, 3 mL of the TBP-phase was used for the
        extractions. Table 2 shows the ratios of TBP/HNO.sub.3/H.sub.2O
        for the three different extractants prepared and used in this
        system. The concentration of H.sub.2O in the organic phase was
        measured by Karl-Fischer titration (Aquacounter AQ-7, Hiranuma,
        Japan) with a 0.1 N NaOH solution after adding a large excess of
        deionized water. </p>

      <p>The solubility of TBP.(HNO.sub.3).sub.1.8.(H.sub.2O).sub.0.6 in
        SF-CO.sub.2 was found to be 2.8 mole % at 323 K and 13.7 MPa.
        The complex TBP.(HNO.sub.3).sub.1.8.(H.sub.2O).sub.0.6 is
        miscible with SF-CO.sub.2 at 15 MPa. The other two complexes,
        TBP.(HNO.sub.3).sub.1.(H.sub.2O).sub.0.4 and
        TBP.(HNO.sub.3).sub.0.7.(H.sub.2O ).sub.0.7, are expected to be
        more soluble, i.e., also miscible, because they contain less
        HNO.sub.3. In addition, the ligand cell 38 was sonicated as
        described above. Therefore, all of the TBP/HNO.sub.3/H.sub.2O
        solution was homogeneously mixed with SF-CO.sub.2 in the ligand
        cell 38 and was expected to remain so as it moved into the
        sample cell. The average residence time for SF-CO.sub.2 entering
        the sample cell was expected to decrease with a decay constant,
        0.091 min.sup.-1, which is the reciprocal number of the average
        residence time. </p>
      <p>The space available for fluid in the sample cell 48 was
        calculated to be 1.3 mL based on the known internal volume of
        the cell and the weight and density of the glass beads. The
        average residence time for the supercritical fluid was estimated
        to be about 2 minutes, which is much shorter than that in the
        ligand cell. Because the collection vial 60 was changed every 2
        minutes, the amount of uranium recovered in each collection vial
        represented the amount of uranium dissolved during the
        corresponding 2-minute interval of the dynamic extraction
        process. </p>
      <p>The effect of applying ultrasound during dissolution at 323 K
        and 15 MPa is illustrated by FIGS. 2 3. For the extractions with
        21 mg of UO.sub.2 (i.e. 18.5 mg of U), the total amount of U
        recovered in 20 minutes was small without sonication, e.g.,
        about 0.8 mg for Extractant No. 1
        (TBP:HNO.sub.3:H.sub.2O=1:0.7:0.7), 1.0 mg for Extractant No. 2
        (TBP:HNO.sub.3:H.sub.2O=1:1.0:0.4), and 1.1 mg for Extractant
        No. 3 (TBP:HNO.sub.3:H.sub.2O=1:1.8:0.6). There appears to be a
        small positive correlation between the TBP:HNO.sub.3 ratio in
        the extractant and the dissolution efficiency. After 20 minutes
        of dynamic extraction, all of the glass beads from the
        extraction cell 48 were examined and black UO.sub.2 powder
        remained on the surface of the glass beads for runs 1 and 4. For
        runs 2 and 3, no remaining UO.sub.2 powder was observed, and the
        glass beads were wetted with an organic solution. This organic
        solution was easily stripped from the glass beads with aqueous
        nitric acid (1.6 M), and a yellow organic solution containing
        UO.sub.2(NO.sub.3).sub.2.2TBP was recovered. Thus, for runs 2
        and 3, the UO.sub.2 powder was all extracted and converted to
        UO.sub.2(NO.sub.3).sub.2.2TBP, but the local concentration of
        the uranyl complex was probably high enough for most of it to
        remain on the surface of the glass beads during the dissolution
        period. </p>
      <p>With the application of ultrasound, the amount of uranium
        recovered from the collection solutions increased significantly.
        The total amount of uranium recovered after 20 minutes of
        dynamic extraction was 14.2 mg with Extractant No. 1
        (17.75.times. the amount without sonication), 15.5 mg with
        Extractant No. 2 (15.5.times. the amount without sonication),
        and 16.6 mg with Extractant No. 3 (15.1.times. the amount
        without sonication) for the extractions where the initial amount
        of UO.sub.2 was 21 mg. These results represent a recovery of
        about 77%, 84%, and 90% of the initial UO.sub.2 in the
        SF-CO.sub.2 by Extractant Nos. 1 3, respectively. For the
        extractions starting with 7.2 mg of UO.sub.2 (or 6.3 mg of
        uranium), Extractant No. 1 extracted 4.6 mg of uranium (or 73%
        of the initial UO.sub.2) after 20 minutes of dynamic extraction
        with the application of ultrasound. This efficiency is slightly
        lower than when the initial amount of UO.sub.2 was 21 mg. In all
        four cases, the dissolution efficiency was increased by an order
        of magnitude with the application of ultrasound. </p>
      <p>The ultrasound-aided dissolution data can be fit to the
        equation E=100(1-e.sup.-.lamda.t) (1) where E is the recovery
        efficiency in % (defined by the ratio of the recovered amount to
        the initial amount), .lamda. is the recovery rate constant in
        min.sup.-1, and t is the extraction time in minutes. For all
        four extractions with the application of ultrasound, the above
        equation provided a curve with a good fit to the data. The
        ultrasound-aided dissolution of UO.sub.2 with the
        TBP/HNO.sub.3/H.sub.2O extractants appears to follow first order
        kinetics. The recovery rate constants .lamda. are
        0.077.+-.0.004, 0.096.+-.0.004, and 0.11.+-.0.003 minutes.sup.-1
        for Extractant Nos. 1 3, respectively. According to these
        .lamda. values, there is a positive correlation of the
        dissolution efficiency with the TBP:HNO.sub.3 ratio in the
        extractant. However, the correlation appears to be small and may
        be within the limits of experimental error. The ultrasound-aided
        dissolution rate constants can be converted to the dissolution
        half-lives from the relationship t.sub.1/2=0.693/.lamda.. The
        calculated t.sub.1/2 for Extractant No. 1 is about 9.0 minutes.
        This means that in a relatively short time (e.g.,
        5.times.t.sub.1/2 , is less than 1 hour) about 97% of the
        UO.sub.2 should be extracted under the specified conditions. For
        Extractant No. 3, extracting about 97% of the initial UO.sub.2
        would take approximately 32 minutes under the same conditions.
        These estimates are based on the assumption that the
        concentration of the TBP/HNO.sub.3/H.sub.2O extractant in the
        flowing SF-CO.sub.2 stream remains constant. A constant
        extractant concentration could be easily insured by using a
        second pump to deliver a constant amount of the extractant to
        the system. In the above described system, a fixed amount (3 mL)
        of the extractant was loaded into the ligand cell 38 and, as a
        result, its concentration in the SF-CO.sub.2 stream would be
        expected to decay over time. Thus, the estimated time to achieve
        a 97% dissolution efficiency may not be accurate for the system
        heretofore described. A constant extractant concentration may in
        fact provide better results. </p>
      <p>The following chemical and physical steps are probably involved
        in this SF-CO.sub.2 process; i.e., the extraction of uranium
        from UO.sub.2 powders spiked on the surface of glass beads with
        an SF-CO.sub.2 system: (a) convective and diffusive mass
        transport of TBP/HNO.sub.3/H.sub.2O in SF-CO.sub.2 to the
        UO.sub.2 powder on the glass surface, (b) dissolution reaction
        of UO.sub.2 with TBP/HNO.sub.3/H.sub.2O in SF-CO.sub.2 and
        formation of UO.sub.2(NO.sub.3).sub.2.2TBP near or on the glass
        surface, and (c) convective and diffusive mass transport of
        UO.sub.2(NO.sub.3).sub.2.2TBP in SF-CO.sub.2 away from the
        surface of the glass bead. </p>
      <p>The glass beads in the sample cell formed narrow pathways, and
        convective diffusion was limited compared with a normal bulk
        space. In porous media, like the pathways defined by the stacked
        glass beads, the diffusion process is usually dominated by
        molecular diffusion. The concentration of
        UO.sub.2(NO.sub.3).sub.2.2TBP formed near the glass surface is
        locally very high because of surface interactions. Other porous
        and/or inert media would have the same effects because of the
        narrow pathways created. When ultrasound is applied, a fast
        dissolution rate may result from an increase in the interfacial
        area between the adhered UO.sub.2(NO.sub.3).sub.2.2TBP and
        SF-CO.sub.2. Because the application of ultrasound leads to a
        vigorous agitation near the glass surface and can enlarge the
        effective diffusivity near the glass surface, the rate of the
        third step (c) can be markedly enhanced. </p>
      <p>If the concentration of TBP/HNO.sub.3/H.sub.2O is low enough,
        the first step (a) could be the rate-controlling process.
        However, the amount of the TBP/HNO.sub.3/H.sub.2O extractant (3
        mL) was in large excess relative to the chemical equivalent
        amount of uranium in the system (by about 30 times). Therefore,
        step (a) should not be rate limiting. This theory is supported
        by the fact that UO.sub.2(NO.sub.3).sub.2.2TBP was found to
        cover the surface of the glass beads after extracting without
        also applying ultrasound. Obviously, the extractant was able to
        dissolve UO.sub.2 without the application of ultrasound, but
        diffusion of the product UO.sub.2(NO.sub.3).sub.2.2TBP in
        SF-CO.sub.2 was relatively slow because of the narrow spaces
        between the beads. </p>
      <p>The dissolution of UO.sub.2 in aqueous nitric acid is known to
        consist of several steps that can be summarized as follows:
        UO.sub.2+4HNO.sub.3.fwdarw.UO.sub.2(NO.sub.3).sub.2+2NO.sub.2+2H.sub.2O
        (2) 2NO.sub.2+H.sub.2O.fwdarw.HNO.sub.3+HNO.sub.2 (3)

.2O

      <p>The oxidation of UO.sub.2 described in the first step (Eqn.
        (2)) proceeds by way of electron transfer at the solid-liquid
        interface. Similar reactions probably also would occur for the
        dissolution of UO.sub.2 in an SF-CO.sub.2 system with the
        TBP/HNO.sub.3/H.sub.2O complex used as an extractant. FIG. 4
        shows a line fitted to a logarithmic plot of the empirical rate
        constants versus the molecular ratio of HNO.sub.3 to TBP has a
        slope of 0.33, which is much smaller than the value of 2.3
        reported for the dissolution of UO.sub.2 in aqueous nitric acid.
        This probably can be attributed to the slow mass transfer in the
        narrow pathways near the surface of the glass beads. </p>
      <p>The example of the embodiment described above, provides support
        for a novel SF-CO.sub.2-based process for the direct dissolution
        of UO.sub.2 that may have important applications for
        reprocessing of spent nuclear fuels and for treatment of nuclear
        wastes. </p>
      <p><b>Example 2</b> </p>
      <p><b>An Apparatus for Ultrasound Enhanced Dissolution of Uranium
          Oxides in SF-CO.sub.2</b> </p>
      <p>In this embodiment, an apparatus (shown in FIG. 5) and method
        are provided for enhanced dissolution of uranium oxides by the
        application of ultrasound to an SF-CO.sub.2 reaction system
        containing HTTA. </p>
      <p>The uranium oxides included depleted UO.sub.3 (Alfa AESAR, Ward
        Hill, Mass., 99.8%), UO.sub.2 (Alfa AESAR, 99.8%), and
        U.sub.30.sub.8 (NBS Standard Reference Material). The ligands
        HTTA and TBP also were obtained from Alfa AESAR and used without
        further purification. SFE-grade carbon dioxide (Air Products,
        Allentown, Pa.) was used for all extractions. Extracted products
        were collected in a collection system 144 containing a trap
        solution (ACS-grade trichloromethane obtained from Fisher,
        Fairlawn, N.J.) through the restrictors 140 made from 150 mm
        lengths of deactivated fused silica, 50 .mu.m i.d., purchased
        from Polymicro Technologies (Phoenix, Ariz.), and a restrictor
        heater 138. Uranium was back extracted from the trap solutions
        using 50% nitric acid (Fisher, Fairlawn, N.J.) followed by
        washing of the organic phase with deionized water produced by a
        Milli-Q Ultra-pure water system (Millipore Inc). </p>
      <p>An ISCO model 260D syringe pump 88 (Isco, Inc, Lincoln, Nebr.)
        with a Series D controller was used to deliver CO.sub.2 to the
        extraction system. The system is illustrated in FIG. 5. Standard
        10.4 cm.sup.3 and 3.47 cm.sup.3 stainless steel HPLC cells
        (Keystone Scientific Inc., Pa.) were used as ligand 118 and
        extraction cells 126, respectively. The ligand cell 118
        containing HTTA was placed upstream from the extraction cell 126
        containing a uranium oxide sample. An oven 130 heated the system
        to the desired temperature. TBP was injected to the system from
        test-tube 110 and filter 108 through a T-end joint 94 and
        volumeless valves used throughout (84, 90, 98, 114, 122, and
        134) using an HPLC pump 102, A-30 ks-pk (Eldex Lab Inc., Calif.,
        USA). This system provided a constant TBP concentration of 0.18
        mol dm.sup.-3. The system illustrated in FIG. 5 allowed
        extractions to be conducted statically, dynamically or by a
        combination of both methods (static dissolution followed by
        dynamic dissolution). Flow rates of CO.sub.2 from the system
        were maintained at .about.0.4 0.5 cm.sup.3 min.sup.-1 and the
        flow was directed through lines 82, 86, 89, 92, 96, 100, 104,
        112, 120, 124, 132, 136, 142, and 146. With the fluid injected
        into the system preheated by coil 116, the extractions were
        carried out at 60.degree. C. and 150 atm. These conditions were
        previously optimized for the system involved (UO.sub.3-TTA-TBP).
        An ultrasonic cleaner with a heater 128, model FS30 (Fisher
        Scientific, Pa.), was used to increase the uranium oxide
        dissolution rate. The extraction cell 126 was placed vertically
        into the ultrasonic cleaner's tank 128 with water preheated to
        the required temperature. The ultrasonic cleaner 128 uses
        transducers mounted to the bottom of its tank to create high
        frequency sound waves in the tank's liquid. The output frequency
        of the ultrasonic device was principally in the range 44 48 kHz.
        Frequencies principally in the range of 20 50 kHz or even 10 100
        kHz can also be used with this apparatus and the methods
        described herein. The collected samples were analyzed for
        uranium content by the spectrophotometric Arsenazo I method.
        Absorption spectra were recorded using a Cary 1E UV-Visible
        recording spectrophotometer. </p>
      <p>The solubility of HTTA in SF-CO.sub.2 was measured to be
        0.041.+-.0.004.sub.M at 60.degree. C. and 150 atm. The
        SF-CO.sub.2 was saturated with HTTA by passing the SF-CO.sub.2
        through a pre-saturation cell containing an excess of HTTA. The
        HTTA (mp 42.degree. C.) was maintained in the liquid state in
        the pre-saturation cell. </p>
      <p><b>Example 3</b> </p>
      <p><b>Dissolution of UO.sub.3 in SF-CO.sub.2 Using the Apparatus
          of Example 2</b> </p>
      <p>The direct reaction of UO.sub.3 with HTTA in large excess
        efficiently occurred in a static reaction cell system. Although
        high conversion efficiency to UO.sub.2(TTA).sub.2.H.sub.2O was
        observed, the complex was not efficiently transported from the
        cell 126 in SF-CO.sub.2. Instead the complex remained in the
        reaction cell as a powdery, orange-colored substance. It was
        necessary to add TBP to the extraction system to enable
        transport of the uranium complex. Because TBP is a stronger
        Lewis base than H.sub.2O, it can replace the coordinated
        H.sub.2O molecule to form the adduct UO.sub.2(TTA).sub.2.TBP,
        which is quite soluble in SF-CO.sub.2. </p>
      <p>The effect of ultrasound application on the dissolution of
        UO.sub.3 in a SF-CO.sub.2 stream containing TBP and HTTA is
        illustrated in FIG. 6. The reaction conditions were 60.degree.
        C. and 150 atm using an SF-CO.sub.2 stream modified with 0.041M
        HTTA and 0.18M TBP. In the absence of ultrasound the dissolution
        rate was slow and the efficiency was poor, i.e., the amount of
        uranium complexed and transported from the extraction cell was
        small. Even with an initial static dissolution period to allow
        the UO.sub.2(TTA).sub.2.H.sub.2O complex to form, the
        dissolution rate and efficiency remained poor. With application
        of ultrasound, the dissolution rate increased significantly.
        Then the dissolution rate decreased as the HTTA in the
        extraction system was depleted. The various steps believed to be
        involved in the dissolution reaction are outlined below: Mass

      <p>The dissolution of UO.sub.3 in the presence of a continuous
        flow of HTTA in SF-CO.sub.2 is illustrated in FIG. 7. The
        dissolution of the oxide and transportation in SF-CO.sub.2 are
        greatly enhanced by the application of ultrasound. Both curves
        show a slight initiation period, which is characteristic of
        oxide dissolution in aqueous systems. This initiation period can
        be defined as the time required for initiating the formation of
        the uranyl-TTA complex. A region in which the dissolution is
        linear with time follows this initiation period. Such a linear
        region potentially indicates a solubility-limited process.
        However, in unmodified (i.e., pure) SF-CO.sub.2 the solubility
        of UO.sub.2(TTA).sub.2.H.sub.2O has been reported as
        approximately 7.times.10.sup.-5M, while the solubility of
        UO.sub.2(TTA).sub.2.TBP in unmodified SF-CO.sub.2 is reported to
        be 4.times.10.sup.-3M. Moreover, in the HTTA/TBP-modified
        SF-CO.sub.2, the actual solubility of the complex is expected to
        be greater than the values reported for the unmodified system.
        Therefore, the hypothesis that the extraction profile is a
        solubility-limited profile can be rejected because the
        solubility of the complex in the SF-CO.sub.2 system is much
        greater than that reflected by the limited actual amounts of
        uranium transported. </p>
      <p>From the above discussion one can conclude that Equation (7) is
        the rate limiting step, since the extraction requires the
        presence of HTTA in the extraction system and the amounts of
        uranium extracted are below the solubility limits of the
        UO.sub.2(TTA).sub.2.TBP in the SF-CO.sub.2 system. The rate at
        which the UO.sub.2(TTA).sub.2.TBP complex forms from the
        UO.sub.2(TTA).sub.2.H.sub.2O complex should be fast in this
        system, since previous work found the displacement of water from
        the UO.sub.2(TTA).sub.2.H.sub.2O complex to be very rapid with a
        range of Lewis base systems. Accordingly, enhanced dissolution
        with the application of ultrasound could be attributable to a
        sort of "cleaning" of the oxide surface by facilitating removal
        or mass transport of the complex as it is formed and allowing
        the reaction with HTTA (Equation 7) to take place more
        efficiently. </p>
      <p><b>Example 4</b> </p>
      <p><b>Dissolution of UO.sub.2 and U.sub.3O.sub.8 in SF-CO.sub.2</b>

      <p>The reaction of UO.sub.2 and U.sub.3O.sub.8 in SF-CO.sub.2
        under conditions similar to those described above in Example 3
        was very slow. Only a small amount of these oxides reacted under
        similar conditions. This low reaction rate is thought to be due
        to the stable nature of these particular uranium oxides. Since
        the higher oxidation state of uranium was found to be very
        reactive, H.sub.2O.sub.2 was added to the system to oxidize the
        uranium to the U.sup.6+ state. H.sub.2O.sub.2 was added to the
        system with the extractants and the SF-CO.sub.2. Much more
        uranium was extracted with the addition of an oxidizing agent.
        Any other peroxide or other agent capable of oxidizing uranium
        would also increase the dissolution rate for these oxides. </p>

      <p>TBP is known to form complexes with aqueous HNO.sub.3, and the
        1:1 and 2:1 (TBP:HNO.sub.3 mole ratio) complexes are

        3 M or less. The TBP-HNO.sub.3 complexes also may contain
        different amounts of water, i.e., have different hydration
        numbers. In one example, the TBP-HNO.sub.3 reagent was prepared
        by adding 5.0 mL of TBP to 0.82 mL concentrated nitric acid
        (69.5%, .rho.=1.42 g cm.sup.-3) in a glass tube with a stopper.
        This mixture of TBP and HNO.sub.3 (about 1:0.7 mole ratio) was
        shaken vigorously for 5 minutes followed by centrifugation for
        20 minutes. After centrifugation, 3 mL of the TBP phase was
        removed for supercritical fluid extractions. The density of the
        TBP phase was measured to be 1.035 g cm.sup.-3. The remaining
        aqueous phase was found to have a pH of about 1 after 20 times
        dilution in water, indicating most of the HNO.sub.3 had reacted
        with TBP to form the TBP-HNO.sub.3 complex. Upon addition of the
        TBP-HNO.sub.3 complex to CDCl.sub.3, small water droplets formed
        in the solution indicating the water in the complex would
        precipitate in an organic solution. </p>
      <p>The solubility of this TBP-HNO.sub.3 complex in liquid CO.sub.2
        at room temperature and 80 atm is about 0.38 mL/mL CO.sub.2.
        Referring to FIG. 5, the TBP-HNO.sub.3 complex (about 3 mL) was
        placed in a 10.4 mL stainless steel cell 118 which was connected
        upstream of a 3.47 mL extraction cell 126 containing about 40 60
        mg of uranium oxide. Liquid CO.sub.2 was added to the cells
        using an ISCO model 260D syringe pump 88 and the system was
        heated in an oven 130 to the desired temperature. Uranium
        dioxide in a powder form (&lt;0.15 mm diameter) was obtained
        from Alfa Aesar (Ward Hill, Mass.). Uranium trioxide was also
        obtained from Alfa Aesar (about 0.15 0.25 mm diameter). </p>
      <p>The uranium oxide extractions were performed with supercritical
        CO.sub.2 containing TBP-HNO.sub.3 flowing through the system at
        a rate of 0.4 mL min.sup.-1 measured at the pump 88. The
        dissolved uranium complex was collected in chloroform in
        collector 144, followed by back extraction with 8M HNO.sub.3 and
        twice washing the organic phase with deionized water. The
        combined acid-water solution was analyzed for uranium
        spectrophotometrically and by ICP-AES. UV-VIS spectroscopy
        showed that the trapped uranium complex had an identical
        absorption spectrum to that previously reported in the
        literature for UO.sub.2(NO.sub.3).sub.22TBP. See M. J. Carrott,
        B. E. Waller, N. G. Smart and C. M. Wai, Chem Commun., 1998,
        373. </p>
      <p>The amount of the TBP-HNO.sub.3 extractant dissolved in the
        CO.sub.2 phase during the dynamic extraction process was
        determined by measuring the change in volume of the extractant
        in the 10.4 ml cell over the course of the extraction. The
        amount of the TBP-HNO.sub.3 extractant in the supercritical
        CO.sub.2 stream was determined to be about 0.08 mL/mL of
        CO.sub.2 at 60.degree. C. and 150 atm. Measured by molecular
        equivalents, an excess of the TBP-HNO.sub.3 extractant with
        respect to UO.sub.2 was used in the dynamic extractions. </p>
      <p>Direct dissolution of UO.sub.2 in supercritical CO.sub.2 under
        the specified conditions apparently occurred rapidly. However,
        dissolution of UO.sub.3 in supercritical CO.sub.2 under the same
        conditions was even more effective. This may be explained by the
        fact that UO.sub.3 is in the hexavalent oxidation state and is
        thereby ready to form the CO.sub.2-soluble
        UO.sub.2(NO.sub.3).sub.2.2TBP complex. The dissolution of
        UO.sub.2 may be represented by Equation (11) assuming the
        TBP-HNO.sub.3 complex has a 1:1 stoichiometry:
        UO.sub.2(solid)+8/3TBP-HNO.sub.3.fwdarw.UO.sub.2(NO.sub.3).sub.22TBP+2/3N-
O+4/3H.sub.2O+2/3TBP





        (11) Similar equations of different stoichiometry can be written
        for the 2:1 and other TBP-HNO.sub.3 complexes. </p>
      <p>Dissolution of UO.sub.2 in liquid CO.sub.2 was slow relative to
        that observed in the supercritical CO.sub.2 extractions. Because
        oxidation of UO.sub.2 is required for the dissolution process,
        the slower diffusion of the oxidized products in the liquid
        phase could be a factor limiting the dissolution rate. The
        diffusion coefficient of supercritical CO.sub.2 is typically an
        order of magnitude higher than that of the liquid. Under the
        same liquid CO.sub.2 conditions, dissolution of UO.sub.3 was
        about the same as that in the supercritical phase, perhaps
        because oxidation was not required. </p>
      <p>The density of supercritical CO.sub.2 influences the solvation
        strength and hence solubility of solutes in supercritical fluid
        phases. The dissolution of UO.sub.2 in supercritical CO.sub.2
        increased rapidly with the density of the fluid phase. After
        twelve minutes of dynamic extraction, the amount of UO.sub.2
        extracted into the supercritical CO.sub.2 phase at density
        0.7662 g cm.sup.-3 was about an order of magnitude higher than
        that at density 0.6125 g cm.sup.-3. The density effect could be
        due in part to the increased amount of the TBP-HNO.sub.3 complex
        in the supercritical CO.sub.2 stream related to the increase in
        density of the fluid phase. This strong dependence of UO.sub.2
        dissolution on supercritical CO.sub.2 density may be used as a
        parameter allowing for selective dissolution and separation of
        UO.sub.2 from materials containing other species. These results
        suggest the possibility of dissolving/extracting spent nuclear
        fuels in supercritical CO.sub.2 without using conventional acid
        and organic solvents. </p>
      <p><b>Example 6</b> </p>
      <p><b>Removal of UO.sub.2 and U.sub.3O.sub.8 From a Sea Sand
          Mixture</b> </p>
      <p>Another embodiment is directed to decontaminating uranium from
        solid wastes containing uranium oxides, UO.sub.2 or
        U.sub.3O.sub.8, using SF-CO.sub.2 containing an HNO.sub.3-TBP
        complex. This embodiment is effective with or without the
        application of ultrasound. It is likely that (1) the H.sup.+
        supplied by the HNO.sub.3-TBP complex dissociates the U-O bond,
        (2) NO.sup.-.sub.3 in the complex plays a role both as an
        oxidant to convert U(IV) to U(VI) and as the counter anion to
        neutralize the uranium ion, and (3) TBP acts as a complex
        forming agent to form the hydrophobic complex, i.e.,
        UO.sub.2(NO.sub.3).sub.2(TBP).sub.2, which is soluble in the
        SF-CO.sub.2 phase. In this example uranium is selectively
        dissolved/extracted into supercritical CO.sub.2, forming the
        complex UO.sub.2(NO.sub.3).sub.2(TBP).sub.2. </p>
      <p>The HNO.sub.3-TBP complex was prepared by vigorously mixing 100
        cm.sup.3 of 70% HNO.sub.3 (Wako Pure Chemicals Co.) with 100
        cm.sup.3 of TBP (Koso Chemical Co.) in a conventional extraction
        tube for 30 minutes. The HNO.sub.3-TBP complex thus obtained was
        determined to contain HNO.sub.3 and TBP in a molar ratio of
        4.5:3 and be a mixture of (HNO.sub.3).sub.2(TBP) and
        HNO.sub.3(TBP) complexes. </p>
      <p>A synthetic solid waste sample was prepared, consisting of a
        mixture of ca. 100 mg of UO.sub.2 or U.sub.3O.sub.8 powder and
        50 g of standard sea sand (Wako, 20 30 mesh). The UO.sub.2
        powder was obtained by mechanically grinding a UO.sub.2 nuclear
        fuel pellet and the U.sub.3O.sub.8 was prepared by heating the
        UO.sub.2 powder in air for 2 hours at 480.degree. C. </p>
      <p>The sample was placed in a reaction vessel. The CO.sub.2 fluid
        was introduced to the vessel using a syringe pump. After the
        pressure reached 20 MPa, the stopcock at the outlet of the
        reaction vessel was opened and CO.sub.2 was allowed to flow
        through the vessel at a rate of 3.5 cm.sup.3/min while keeping
        the pressure at 20 MPa. The HNO.sub.3-TBP complex was mixed into
        the CO.sub.2 stream using a plunger pump to continuously inject
        the complex at a rate of 0.3 cm.sup.3/min. The mixture of the
        HNO.sub.3-TBP complex and CO.sub.2 was allowed to flow through
        the system for 20 minutes (for a dynamic dissolution). The total
        volume of the mixture flowing through the vessel in this dynamic
        dissolution step was approximately 2.5.times. the dead space of
        the reaction vessel (ca. 30 cm.sup.3). Then, both stopcocks at
        the inlet and the outlet of the reaction vessel were closed and
        the system was allowed to stand for 60 90 minutes (for a static
        dissolution). Carbon dioxide was allowed to flow through the
        vessel at 3.5 cm.sup.3/min for 60 minutes after the static
        dissolution. The CO.sub.2 flow eluted from the reaction vessel
        was collected through a restrictor. The dissolved species, i.e.,
        UO.sub.2(NO3).sub.2(TBP).sub.2 complex, was collected in the
        collection vessel at ambient pressure and the CO.sub.2 allowed
        to gasify. Dynamic dissolution and static dissolution procedures
        were repeated twice. As detailed above in Example 1, the sand
        sample was washed with concentrated nitric acid and the
        concentration of uranium in the washing solution was analyzed by
        an ICP-AES (Shimadzu, ICPS-8000E). </p>
      <p>The UO.sub.2 or U.sub.3O.sub.8 remaining on the treated sand
        sample was 0.3 mg (decontamination factor DF=350) or 0.01 mg
        (DF=10,000), respectively. Most of the uranium (95 99%) was
        recovered from the collection vessel. Uranium(VI) was
        quantitatively stripped as U(VI)-carbonate from the
        UO.sub.2(NO.sub.3).sub.2(TBP).sub.2 using an aqueous solution of
        (NH.sub.4).sub.2CO.sub.3 allowing the recovered TBP to be
        reused. </p>

      <p><b>Description</b> </p>
      <p><b>TECHNICAL FIELD</b> </p>
      <p>The invention pertains to compounds for binding lanthanide ions
        and actinide ions. The invention further pertains to compounds
        for binding radionuclides, and to methods of making radionuclide
        complexes. Also, the invention pertains to methods of extracting
        radionuclides. Additionally, the invention pertains to methods
        of delivering radionuclides to target locations. </p>
      <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>Lanthanide elements and actinide elements have a number of
        industrial and medicinal uses. For purposes of interpreting this
        document and the claims that follow, the term "lanthanide
        element" is defined to encompass the elements La, Ce, Pr, Nd,
        Pm, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb, and Lu, and the term
        "actinide element" is defined to encompass the elements Ac, Th,
        Pa, U, Np, Pu, Am, Cm, Bk, Cf, Es, Fm, Md, No, Lr, Rf, and Ha. </p>
      <p>The above-listed lanthanide and actinide elements can be used,
        for example, as imaging agents. For instance, the elements Tb
        and Eu are characterized by fluorescence and luminescence, and
        can be used as probes in biological systems. Yb also has
        spectroscopic characteristics that enable it to be a useful
        probe in biological systems. </p>
      <p>A difficulty in utilizing the lanthanide or actinide elements
        as probes in biological systems is in localizing the elements to
        specific areas of a biological system which are to be probed.
        Accordingly, it would be desirable to bind lanthanide or
        actinide elements to a transport compound which would
        specifically transport the elements to a localized region of a
        biological system. </p>
      <p>Another use of lanthanide and actinide ions is as cell toxicity
        agents. For example, .sup.225 Ac is a radioactive element which
        decays successively to </p>
      <p>Bi-209 by emission of four alpha particles. Alpha particles are
        lethal to cells when they traverse cell nuclei in close
        proximity to the radioactive source. Accordingly, .sup.225 Ac
        has utility for cancer treatment. A difficulty in utilizing
        .sup.225 Ac for cancer treatment is to localize the .sup.225 Ac
        within close proximity to cancer cells. Accordingly, it would be
        desirable to develop a transport compound that would
        specifically transport .sup.225 Ac to cancer cells in a
        biological system. </p>
      <p>In recent years there has been an increased interest in the
        development of monoclonal antibodies that specifically target
        cancer cells and tumors. It is thought that such antibodies can
        be labeled with radionuclides and utilized to transport the
        radionuclides to cancer cells and tumors for utilization in
        radioimmunodiagnosis and radioimmunotherapy of cancer. The
        success of such approaches depends on development of
        bifunctional complexing agents that can bind a radionuclide
        strongly and selectively, and that can be further linked to
        antibodies. Accordingly, it would be desirable to develop such
        bifunctional complexing agents. </p>
      <p>A recently discovered class of compounds known as calixarenes,
        or "molecular baskets", show potential for being able to tightly
        and selectively bind a number of different elements. Calixarenes
        are cyclic oligomers made up of phenolic units meta-linked by
        methylene bridges and possessing bowl-shaped cavities. To
        specify a size of a calixarene, one intercalates between
        brackets a number that represents the number of phenolic units
        constituting calixarene. Four formulaic representations of a
        prior art calix[4]arene are illustrated in FIG. 1 as "A", "B",
        "C" and "D". Each formulaic representation has several R-groups.
        The R-groups represent alkyl groups, such as t-butyl groups. In
        the formulaic representation labeled "C", it shown that a
        calixarene can be thought of as a compound containing an upper
        rim 10 and a lower rim 12. A plurality of hydroxyl groups of the
        calixarene are attached to lower rim 12. </p>
      <p>Calixarenes are relatively easy to synthesize. For example,
        many calixarenes can be synthesized by a one-pot base-induced
        condensation of p-substituted phenol and formaldehyde. </p>
      <p><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>In one aspect, the invention includes a compound which has a
        calix[n]arene group, wherein n is an integer greater than 3. The
        calix[n]arene group comprises an upper rim and a lower rim. The
        compound further has at least one ionizable group attached to
        the lower rim, and an ion selected from the group consisting of
        lanthanide and actinide elements bound to the ionizable group. </p>
      <p>In another aspect, the invention includes a method of making a
        radionuclide complexing compound. A calix[n]arene compound is
        provided, wherein n is an integer greater than 3. The
        calix[n]arene compound comprises at least one phenolic hydroxyl
        group. The hydroxyl group is converted to an ester, and the
        ester is converted to an acid. A radionuclide is provided to be
        bound to the acid. </p>
      <p>In yet another aspect, the invention includes a method of
        extracting a radionuclide. A sample comprising a radionuclide is
        provided. A calix[n]arene compound is provided in contact with
        the sample, wherein n is an integer greater than 3. Radionuclide
        is extracted from the sample and into the calix[n]arene
        compound. </p>

      <p><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b> </p>
      <p>This disclosure of the invention is submitted in furtherance of
        the constitutional purposes of the U.S. Patent Laws "to promote
        the progress of science and useful arts" (Article 1, Section 8).
      </p>
      <p>In a particular aspect, the invention encompasses compounds
        comprising calix[n]arene groups having at least one ionizable
        group attached to a lower rim 12 (shown in FIG. 1) of the
        calix[n]arene group, and having an ion selected from the group
        consisting of lanthanide and actinide elements bound to the
        ionizable group. The n in calix[n]arene preferably comprises an
        integer greater than 3 and less than 7. The ion can comprise,
        for example, Ac.sup.3+, Eu.sup.2+, Tb.sup.4+, or Yb.sup.2+. </p>
      <p>The ionizable group attached to the calix[n]arene can comprise,
        for example, one or more functional groups selected from the
        group consisting of carboxylic acid and hydroxamic acid. Methods
        for attaching carboxylic acid or hydroxamic acid to a lower rim
        12 (shown in FIG. 1) of a calix[n]arene are described with
        reference to FIGS. 2-4. Referring first to FIG. 2, a synthesis
        starts with a calix[n]arene compound "E". Compound "E" comprises
        n aryl rings, wherein n is an integer greater than 3 and less
        than 7. For instance, n can be 4 or 6. Compound "E" further
        comprises n R-groups. The R-groups influence the solubility of
        compound "E" in various solvents. If the solvents are organic,
        the R-groups can include alkyl groups such as t-butyl, and can
        include H. If the solvent is water, the R-groups are preferably
        selected from a group consisting of --SO.sub.3 H, --SO.sub.2
        N(CH.sub.2 CH.sub.2 OH).sub.2, --N.sup.+ R.sub.3,
        polyethyleneoxy chains, --SO.sub.2 NHCH.sub.2 C(O)N(CH.sub.2
        CH.sub.2 OH).sub.3, --PO.sub.3.sup.-, and other polar groups, to
        make compound "E" water soluble. </p>
      <p>Compound "E" is reacted with BrCH.sub.2 COOEt and sodium
        hydride in tetrahydrofuran (THF) to convert one or more phenolic
        hydroxyl groups of "E" into esters and to thereby form "F". More
        specifically, "F" is formed as follows. To a stirred solution of
        "E" (1 mmol) in dry THF (50 mL) is added sodium hydride (0.2 g,
        ca. 10 mmol) followed by ethyl bromoacetate (1.7 g, 10 mmol).
        The reaction mixture is refluxed under nitrogen overnight.
        Subsequently, the solvent is removed under reduced pressure to
        yield "F". </p>
      <p>Compound "F" is reacted in sodium hydroxide, ethanol and water,
        followed by neutralization with HCl, to convert the esters to
        carboxylic acids and to thereby form "G". More specifically, "F"
        is converted to "G" as follows. To "F" (1 mmol in 30 ml of
        ethanol) is added 3N NaOH (20 ml), and the resulting mixture is
        refluxed for 24 hours. Most of the ethanol is then removed under
        reduced pressure to form a reduced solution. An excess of 2N HCl
        is added to the reduced solution to precipitate a white solid
        ("G"). The crude white solid is extracted with chloroform to
        remove inorganic salts. The resulting residue is recrystallized
        from ethanol-H.sub.2 O. </p>
      <p>Compound "G" can be combined with a lanthanide or actinide ion
        to bind the ion with compound "G". Alternatively, compound "G"
        can be further reacted via the scheme in FIG. 2 to form a
        hydroxamic acid from the carboxylic acid. Specifically, compound
        "G" is reacted with (COCl).sub.2 to form acid chloride
        derivative "H". Compound "H" is then reacted with C.sub.6
        H.sub.5 CH.sub.2 ONH.sub.2 to form compound "I". Subsequently,
        compound "I" is reacted with H.sub.2 using Pd--C as a catalyst
        to form the hydroxamic acid derivative "J". Alternatively,
        compound "J" can be produced by a one-pot reaction from compound
        "F" and hydroxylamine in a relatively low yield. Compound "J"
        can be combined with a lanthanide or actinide ion to bind the
        ion. </p>
      <p>It is noted that a degree of derivatization of the
        calix[n]arenes of the present invention can be controlled by the
        basicity, amount of ethyl bromoacetate, and amount of different
        bases. Thus, compound "G" can comprise numerous partially
        derivatized and fully derivatized calix[n]arene carboxylic acid
        derivatives, including calix[4]arene-monocarboxylic acid,
        calix[4]arene-dicarboxylic acid, calix[4]arene-tricarboxylic
        acid, calix[4]arene-tetracarboxylic acid,
        calix[6]arene-monocarboxylic acid, calix[6]arene-dicarboxylic
        acid, calix[6]arene-tricarboxylic acid,
        calix[6]arene-tetracarboxylic acid,
        calix[6]arene-pentacarboxylic acid, and
        calix[6]arene-hexacarboxylic acid. Further, compound "J" can
        comprise numerous partially derivatized and fully derivatized
        calix[n]arene hydroxamic acid derivatives, including
        calix[4]arene-monohydroxamic acid, calix[4]arene-dihydroxamic
        acid, calix[4]arene-trihydroxamic acid,
        calix[4]arene-tetrahydroxamic acid, calix[6]arene-monohydroxamic
        acid, calix[6]arene-dihydroxamic acid,
        calix[6]arene-trihydroxamic acid, calix[6]arene-tetrahydroxamic
        acid, calix[6]arene-pentahydroxamic acid and
        calix[6]arene-hexahydroxamic acid. </p>
      <p>Alternate synthesis routes for forming hydroxamic acid
        derivatives and carboxylic acid derivatives of calix[n]arenes
        are illustrated in FIG. 3. The reaction sequence of FIG. 3
        starts with compound "F" of FIG. 2. Compound "F" is reacted with
        CF.sub.3 COOH to form compound "K". Compound "K" is then reacted
        with (COCl).sub.2 to form compound "L". Subsequently, compound
        "L" is reacted with R'R"NH to form "M". The R'-group comprises
        methyl or ethyl, and the R"-group comprises methyl or ethyl. The
        amide groups (such as CONR'R") generally have higher metal
        affinity than corresponding aryl esters. Compound "M" is reacted
        with sodium hydroxide in ethanol and water, followed by
        neutralization with hydrochloric acid, to form compound "N".
        Compound "N" is a carboxylic acid derivative of a calix[n]arene
        which can subsequently be bound to a lanthanide ion or an
        actinide ion. Alternatively, compound "N" can be reacted with
        (COCl).sub.2, followed by reaction with C.sub.6 H.sub.5 CH.sub.2
        ONH.sub.2, followed by reaction with hydrogen and Pd--C to form
        compound "O". Compound "O" is a hydroxamic acid derivative of a
        calix[n]arene which can subsequently be bound to a lanthanide
        ion or an actinide ion. </p>
      <p>Although the reaction sequence of FIG. 3 is illustrated for a
        calix[4]arene, it is to be understood that the reaction sequence
        could also apply to other calix[n]arenes. </p>
      <p>Another reaction sequence for forming hydroxamic acid
        derivatives and carboxylic acid derivatives of calix[n]arenes is
        illustrated in FIG. 4. The reaction sequence of FIG. 4 starts
        with compound "F.sub.1 ", which is similar to compound "F" of
        FIG. 2. Compound "F.sub.1 " is reacted with ClCH.sub.2
        CONEt.sub.2, K.sub.2 CO.sub.3 and NaI, in THF to form compound
        "P". Compound "P" is then reacted with Me.sub.4 NOH, EtOH and
        water, followed by neutralization with hydrochloric acid, to
        form compound "Q". Compound "Q" is a carboxylic acid derivative
        of a calix[n]arene which can then be bound to a lanthanide or
        actinide ion. Alternatively, compound "Q" can be reacted with
        (COCl).sub.2, followed by reaction with C.sub.6 H.sub.5 CH.sub.2
        ONH.sub.2, and followed by reaction with H.sub.2 and Pd--C to
        form compound "R". Compound "R" is a hydroxamic acid derivative
        of a calix[n]arene can subsequently be bound to a lanthanide ion
        or an actinide ion. </p>
      <p>The derivatized calix[n]arene compounds "G", "J", "N", "O",
        "Q", and "R" can be utilized for a number of applications. For
        example, the compounds can be utilized to selectively extract
        radionuclides from solutions comprising such radionuclides, such
        as radioactive waste. For instance, a calix[4]arene-dicarboxylic
        acid can be utilized to selectively extract Ac.sup.3+ from
        samples comprising Ac.sup.3+. After extraction of the
        radionuclide from the samples, the Ac.sup.3+
        -calix[4]arene-dicarboxylic acid complex can be removed from the
        samples to clean the samples of radioactivity. The samples are
        then non-radioactive and can be disposed of by relatively
        low-cost procedures, rather than the high-cost procedures
        normally associated with radioactive waste disposal. </p>
      <p>Another example use of the calix[n]arene compounds of the
        present invention is to deliver radionuclides to specific target
        locations. To utilize the compounds for such delivery of
        radionuclides, the compounds can be first joined to one or more
        chemicals specific to a target location. A class of chemicals
        known to have particular targeting abilities are antibodies. For
        instance, the monoclonal antibody referred to as B1-anti-CD20
        (produced by Coulter Immunology, Inc.) is known to be specific
        for tumor cells. </p>
      <p>As antibodies are proteins, the calix[n]arene compounds of the
        present invention can be linked to antibodies using conventional
        protein linking functional groups. Preferably, functional groups
        for linking proteins to the calix[n]arene compounds of the
        present invention are provided on upper rim 10 (shown in FIG. 1)
        of the calix[n]arene compounds. Example methods for forming such
        functional groups on an upper rim of a calix[n]arene compound
        are described with reference to FIGS. 5-7. </p>
      <p>Referring to FIG. 5, an amine linking group is formed on an
        upper rim of a calix[n]arene compound derivatized with
        tetracarboxylic acid or tetrahydroxamic acid on its lower rim.
        The synthesis shown in FIG. 5 begins with compound "F" of FIG.
        2. Compound "F" is reacted with nitric acid to form compound
        "S". Compound "S" is reacted first with sodium hydroxide in
        ethanol and water, and subsequently with hydrochloric acid to
        form the calix[4]arene-tetracarboxylic acid derivative "T".
        Compound "T" can then be reacted by either of two alternative
        synthetic routes to form either the tetracarboxylic acid
        derivative "V" or the tetrahydroxamic acid derivative "X.
        Referring first to the synthesis of "V", compound "T" is reacted
        with SnCl.sub.2 in ethanol to form "U". Compound "U" comprises
        an amine group. The amine group of "U" is reacted with a
        carboxylic acid group of a protein, such as an antibody, to form
        "V". Proteins contain carboxylic acid groups at their C
        terminus, as well as at side chains of various amino acids.
        Methods of forming peptide bonds between amine groups and
        carboxylic acid groups are known to persons of ordinary skill in
        the art. The calix[n]arene compound "U" can be bound to a
        radionuclide before attaching the compound to an antibody to
        form "V". Alternatively, "V" can be formed from "U" which is not
        bound to a radionuclide, and "V" can be subsequently bound to a
        radionuclide. </p>
      <p>Referring next to the synthesis of compound "X", "T" is reacted
        with (COCl).sub.2, followed by C.sub.6 H.sub.5 CH.sub.2
        ONH.sub.2, followed by H.sub.2 and Pd--C to form compound "W".
        Compound "W" is then reacted first with SnCl.sub.2 in ethanol,
        and subsequently with a carboxylic acid group of an antibody to
        form compound "X". The calix[n]arene compound "W" can be bound
        to a radionuclide before attaching the compound to an antibody
        to form "X". Alternatively, "X" can be formed from "W" which is
        not bound to a radionuclide, and "X" can be subsequently bound
        to a radionuclide. </p>
      <p>Referring to FIG. 6, an alternate method of attaching an
        antibody to a calix[4]arene-tetracarboxylic acid or
        calix[4]arene-tetrahydroxamic acid is shown. The reaction scheme
        of FIG. 6 starts with compound "F" from FIG. 2, which is reacted
        with N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) to form the brominated </p>
      <p>compound "Y". Compound "Y" is then reacted with sodium
        hydroxide in ethanol and water, followed by neutralization with
        hydrochloric acid, to form "Z". Compound "Z" can then be reacted
        directly with an antibody to form the compound "AA".
        Alternatively, compound "Z" can be converted to a hydroxamic
        acid derivative "AB" prior to reaction with an antibody to form
        compound "AC". In reacting either compound "Z" or compound "AB"
        with an antibody, a bromine is displaced by an amino group of
        the antibody. Antibodies have amino groups at their N-terminus,
        as well as at the side chains of various amino acids. Methods of
        displacing bromine with amino groups are known to persons of
        ordinary skill in the art. </p>
      <p>Referring to FIG. 7, another method for attaching an antibody
        to a calix[4]arene-tetracarboxylic acid or
        calix[4]arene-tetrahydroxamic acid is shown. The reaction scheme
        of FIG. 7 starts with a calix[4]arene compound "BA". Compound
        "BA" is converted to a monoallyl ether derivative (compound
        "BB") by reacting equivalent moles of "BA" and allyl bromide in
        the presence of a very weak base CsF. Claisen rearrangement of
        "BB" in refluxing N,N-dimethylaniline leads to
        mono-2-propenylcalix[4]arene (compound "BC"). Subsequent
        isomerization of the double bond with tBuOK converts "BC" to
        "BD". Ozonolysis of "BD" in CHCl.sub.3 forms
        mono-carboxaldehyde-calix[4]arene (compound "AD"). Compound "AD"
        is reacted with HOCH.sub.2 CH.sub.2 OH and p-CH.sub.3 C.sub.6
        H.sub.4 SO.sub.3 to form compound "AE", which is then reacted
        with BrCH.sub.2 CO.sub.2 Et, and sodium hydride in THF to form
        "AF". Compound "AF" is reacted with sodium hydroxide in ethanol
        and water, and subsequently neutralized with hydrochloric acid,
        to form "AG". Compound "AG" can be reacted with an antibody to
        form calix[4]arene-tetracarboxylic acid bound to the antibody
        (compound "AH"). Alternatively, compound "AG" can be reacted
        with (COCl).sub.2, followed by reaction with C.sub.6 H.sub.5
        CH.sub.2 ONH.sub.2, followed by reaction with hydrogen and Pd--C
        to form the tetrahydroxamic acid derivative "AI". Compound "AI"
        can then be reacted with an antibody to attach the antibody to
        the calix[4]arene-tetrahydroxamic acid and form "AJ". Regardless
        of which of the FIG. 7 reaction routes is chosen, an amino group
        of an antibody will react with an aldehyde of a calix[4]arene
        compound. Methods for reacting amino groups of proteins with
        aldehydes are known to persons of ordinary skill in the art. </p>
      <p>In preferred aspects of the present invention, water
        solubilization groups are bound to calixarene compounds of the
        present invention to increase solubility of the compounds in
        aqueous solutions. Suitable water solubilization functional
        groups include, for example, sulfonates, nitrates, carboxylates,
        and ammonium ions. Water solubility of calixarene compounds of
        the present invention can be particularly important in
        applications wherein the compounds are bound to proteins (such
        as, for example, antibodies). If the calixarene compounds are
        insoluble, this can cause precipitation or aggregation of
        proteins associated with the compounds. </p>
      <p>Some methods of binding proteins to calixarene compounds were
        described above with reference to FIGS. 5-7. Additional methods
        are described below with reference to FIGS. 8-10. Referring
        first to FIG. 8, such shows a general reaction scheme wherein a
        calixarene molecule "BQ" is provided to have a water
        solubilization group Q on its upper rim (10 of FIG. 1) and a
        pair of chelation groups Z on its lower rim (12 of FIG. 1).
        Chelation groups Z can comprise, for example, carboxylic acid
        and/or hydroxamic acid. It is to be understood that compound
        "BQ" is merely an exemplary compound. For instance, in other
        embodiments compound "BQ" could comprise more than one water
        solubilization group Q, and from one to four chelation groups Z.
      </p>
      <p>In addition to the water solubilization group Q on the upper
        rim, compound "BQ" also comprises a component X on the upper
        rim. Component X will ultimately be utilized for attaching a
        protein to the calixarene of compound "BQ". An initial reaction
        is to convert component X to a functional group Y, and to
        thereby convert compound "BQ" to the illustrated compound "BR".
        Functional group Y is chosen to be either directly reactive with
        a protein, or to be reactive with a cross-linking reagent. </p>
      <p>After the initial reaction, compound "BR" can proceed through
        one of two illustrated reaction pathways for linking a protein
        to the calixarene. A first reaction pathway (illustrated as
        pathway "A" in FIG. 8) comprises reacting Y reacted with a
        protein to form the compound "BS". Suitable functional groups Y
        for reaction with proteins are described above with reference to
        FIGS. 5-7. A second reaction pathway (illustrated as pathway "B"
        in FIG. 8) comprises initial linking of functional group Y with
        a cross-linking reagent, and subsequent reaction of the
        cross-linking reagent with a protein. More specifically,
        compound "BR" is reacted with a cross-linking reagent to form a
        reactive functional group Y' attached to the calixarene and to
        thereby form the molecule "BT". Y' is then reacted with a
        functional group on a protein to form the molecule "BU". </p>
      <p>In the reaction sequences shown in FIG. 8, both the water
        solubilization group Q and the protein reactive group Y (or Y')
        are attached to an upper rim (10 of FIG. 1) of a calixarene
        compound. Such is a preferred orientation, as such can avoid
        interference of water solubilization group Q with chelating
        activity of chelation groups Z. A difficulty in providing water
        solubilization group Q at the top of a calixarene structure is
        that such can enable rotation of an aryl ring of a calixarene
        molecule about one of the bridging methylenes that connects the
        aryl ring with other aryl rings of the molecule. Typically,
        large, bulky groups (such as tertiary butyl groups) are provided
        on the upper rim of calixarene structures to restrict aryl
        groups from rotating about bridging methylenes. However, it is
        found that in methods of the present invention, provision of
        metal chelation structures at the bottoms (i.e., on the lower
        rim) of calixarene compounds can block rotation of aryl groups
        about bridging methylene groups. Accordingly, it is generally
        preferred to provide chelating groups on calixarene compounds of
        the present invention relatively early in synthetic reaction
        sequences for forming calixarene compounds of the present
        invention. The early incorporation of chelating groups Z onto
        calixarene compounds of the present invention may lead to
        difficulties in later steps of synthesis of calixarene compounds
        of the present invention, as the chelating functional groups may
        be reactive with components utilized in the later sequence
        steps. However, such difficulties can be overcome by protecting
        and de-protecting the chelating functional groups. </p>
      <p>The functional group Y utilized in reaction pathway "A" (i.e.,
        the group Y utilized for direct reaction with a protein) can
        comprise, for example, an activated carboxylate ester for
        reaction with amine groups on a protein. Exemplary activated
        carboxylate esters include, N-hydroxysuccinimidyl ester,
        N-hydroxyphthalimide esters, phenyl ester, p-nitrophenyl ester,
        tetrafluorophenyl ester, and pentafluorophenyl ester.
        Alternatively, Y can be a sulfhydryl reactive moiety, such as,
        for example, maleimides, alpha-halo acids, benzyl halides, and
        alkyl halides. In yet other alternative embodiments, Y can be
        reactive with oxidized carbohydrate or amino acid groups on a
        protein. In such alternative embodiments, Y can be an aldehyde
        or ketone reactive moiety, such as, for example, amines (which
        can be obtained through, for example, reductive amination) alkyl
        hydrazines, aryl hydrazines, acyl hydrazines, and alkoxylamines.
        In yet another alternative embodiment, Y can be reactive with
        carboxylates on a protein and can comprise, for example, an
        amine (wherein the conjugation can be facilitated by, for
        example, the use of a water solubilized carbodiimide). </p>
      <p>In the reaction pathway "B" of FIG. 8, Y can be, for example,
        an amine group, sulfhydryl group, or hydrazine group.
        Utilization of a cross-linking reagent (pathway "B") can be
        preferred over direct reaction of a calixarene with a protein
        (pathway "A"), in that the cross-linking reagent can function as
        a spacer between a protein and the calixarene to alleviate
        steric interactions that could interfere with the calixarene's
        utilization in chelation processes. The cross-linking reagent
        attached to "Y" can be commercially or synthetically available,
        and can be homobifunctional or heterobifunctional. With
        homobifunctional cross-linking reagents, there are two identical
        reactive moieties on each end. A large excess of the
        homobifunctional cross-linking reagent must generally be used to
        avoid cross-linking between calixarenes. Homobifunctional
        cross-linking reagents include, but are not limited to,
        bismaleimidohexane (which is reactive with sulfhydryl groups),
        disuccinimidyl glutarate (which is reactive with amines),
        disuccinimidyl tartrate (reactive with amines), and dimethyl
        adipimidate (reactive with amines). </p>
      <p>Heterobifunctional cross-linking reagents comprise two
        different reactive functionalities. Accordingly, selective
        reaction with "Y" can be achieved without cross-linking two
        calixarene moieties. Heterobifunctional cross-linking reagents
        are generally preferred. Exemplary heterobifunctional
        cross-linking reagents include molecules reactive with amines
        and sulfhydryl groups, such as, for example,
        N-maleimidobutyrloxysuccinimide ester and
        m-maleimidobenzoyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester. </p>
      <p>Exemplary methods for attaching water solubilization groups and
        proteins to calixarene compounds of the present invention are
        shown in FIGS. 9 and 10. Referring first to FIGS. 9A and 9B,
        t-butylcalix[4]arene (compound "CA") is reacted with AlCl.sub.3,
        phenol and toluene to convert "CA" (through Lewis acid catalyzed
        de-tert-butylation) to calix[4]arene (compound "CB"). The
        calix[4]arene is reacted with benzoyl chloride in pyridine to
        form 25, 26, 27-tribenzoyloxy-28-hydroxycalix[4]arene (compound
        "CC"). Compound "CC" is reacted with Br.sub.2 in CH.sub.2
        Cl.sub.2 to form the illustrated compound "CD". Compound "CD" is
        reacted with NaOH in THF--EtOH--H.sub.2 O to form the compound
        "CE". Compound "CE" is converted to cyanocalix[4]arene (compound
        "CF") with cuprous cyanide in N-methylpyrrolidinone under
        Rosenmund-von-Braun conditions. Compound "CF" is esterified by
        reaction with bromacetyl acetate using NaH as a base and THF as
        solvent to form compound "CG". Compound "CG" is reacted with
        ClSO.sub.3 H in CH.sub.2 Cl.sub.2 to form compound CH, which is
        reacted with NH(CH.sub.2 CH.sub.2 OH).sub.2 in CHCl.sub.3 to
        form the compound "CI" having a water solubilization group bound
        to its upper rim. Compound "CI" is reacted with Me.sub.4 NOH,
        THF--H.sub.2 O to hydrolyze the esters and form compound "CJ".
        Compound "CJ" is reacted with NaBH.sub.4 and CoCl.sub.2 to form
        the compound "CK". Compound "CK" can then be reacted with a
        protein (such as an antibody) to bind the protein and form the
        compound "CL". </p>
      <p>Another process for forming a water solubilization group and a
        protein on an upper rim of a calixarene compound of the present
        invention is described with reference to FIGS. 10A and 10B. A
        starting material of t-butylcalix[4]arene (compound "DA") is
        reacted with benzoyl chloride utilizing 1-methylimidazole as a
        base to form a tribenzoylated derivative (compound "DB").
        Compound "DB" is reacted with AlCl.sub.3, phenol and toluene.
        Such results in Lewis acid catalyzed de-tert-butylation to form
        compound "DC". It is noted that the de-tert-butylation only
        occurs at the para position of the phenol hydroxy group, and
        that the para positions of the phenoxy ethers remain untouched.
        The benzoyl groups are de-protected by hydrolysis utilizing NaOH
        in EtOH--H.sub.2 O to form compound "DD". Compound "DD" is then
        further derivatized by a chlormethylation procedure utilizing
        ClCH.sub.2 OC.sub.8 H.sub.17 and SnCl.sub.4 in CH.sub.2 Cl.sub.2
        to form compound "DE". Compound "DE" is reacted with NaCN in
        DMSO to form compound "DF". The remaining t-butyl groups of
        compound "DF" are removed using AlCl.sub.3 as a Lewis acid
        catalyst in phenol and toluene to form the compound "DG".
        Compound "DG" is reacted with BrCH.sub.2 COOEt and NaH in THF to
        form compound "DH". Compound "DH" is reacted with ClSO.sub.3 H
        in CH.sub.2 Cl.sub.2 to form compound "DI", which is then
        reacted with NH(CH.sub.2 CH.sub.2 OH).sub.2 in CHCl.sub.3 to
        form compound "DJ". Compound "DJ" is reacted with Me.sub.4 NOH
        in THF--H.sub.2 O to form compound "DK", and compound "DK" is
        reacted with NaBH.sub.4 and CoCl.sub.2 to form compound "DL".
        Compound "DL" can then be attached to a protein (such as an
        antibody) to form compound "DM". </p>
      <p>Competition experiments have been performed utilizing
        t-butyl-calix[4]arene-tetracarboxylic acid and
        t-butyl-calix[6]arene-hexacarboxylic acid. The experiments
        indicate that both t-butyl calix[4]arene-tetracarboxylic acid
        and t-butyl-calix[6]arene-hexacarboxylic acid are good
        ionophores for coordination of Ac.sup.3+ under neutral or weakly
        acidic conditions. Specifically, two phase solvent extraction
        studies showed high selectivity of calix[4]arene-tetracarboxylic
        acid and calix[6]arene-hexacarboxylic acid for Ac.sup.3+ over
        alkaline, alkaline earth, and zinc metal ions under neutral and
        weakly acidic conditions. The two phase solvent extraction
        experiments were carried out between water (1.5 mL, [.sup.225
        Ac]=10.sup.-3 mM) and chloroform (1.5 mL, [ionophore]=2 mM). The
        mixture was shaken for 30 minutes at 25.degree. C. This time
        period was confirmed as being sufficient to achieve equilibrium
        within the mixture. The distribution ratio D ([Ac.sup.3+ ] in
        the organic phase/[Ac.sup.3+ ] in the aqueous phase) was
        measured with .gamma.-ray spectrometry. Extractability (Ex %)
        was calculated as D/(1+D). FIG. 11 illustrates Ex % of Ac.sup.3+
        with calix[4]arene-tetracarboxylic acid and
        calix[6]arene-hexacarboxylic acid plotted against a pH of the
        aqueous phase. For calix[4]arene-tetracarboxylic acid, Ex %
        becomes appreciable at pH 2.0 and reaches a plateau at about pH
        4.0, giving nearly 100% extractability. The Ex % decreases
        sharply at pH greater than 7.3. When pH reaches 8.0, only about
        40% of Ac.sup.3+ is extracted. The Ex % for
        calix[6]arene-hexacarboxylic acid shows a similar pH dependence.
        The Ex % increases from pH 1.5, reaches saturation at a pH of
        about 3.0, and decreases sharply after pH of about 7.5. The
        decrease in Ex % at higher pH can be explained by the formation
        of Ac(OH).sup.2+ species, which are probably too large to enter
        the rigid preorganized calixarene cavities. </p>
      <p>Referring to FIG. 12, a plot of log(D) versus log[L] for the
        extraction of Ac.sup.3+ by calix[4]arene-tetracarboxylic acid
        and calix[6]arene-hexacarboxylic acid at pH 6 is illustrated.
        [L] is the concentration of ligand, with ligand being either
        calix[4]arene-tetracarboxylic acid or
        calix[6]arene-hexacarboxylic acid. There is a linear
        relationship between log[L] and log(D) for both
        calix[4]arene-tetracarboxylic acid and
        calix[6]arene-hexacarboxylic acid. The slopes of log(D) vs.
        log[L] for both calix[4]arene-tetracarboxylic acid and
        calix[6]arene-hexacarboxylic acid are roughly equal to 1.
        Specifically, the data of the first series fits the equation
        y=-1.06x+5.114, with R.sup.2 =0.9991, and the data of the second
        series fits the equation y=-1.0467x+4.362, with R.sup.2 =0.9991.
        Such slopes approximately equal to 1 indicate that both
        calix[4]pg,25 arene-tetracarboxylic acid and
        calix[6]arene-hexacarboxylic acid form 1:1 complexes with
        Ac.sup.3+ at pH 6. </p>
      <p>As .sup.225 Ac is radioactive, it is impossible to get the
        stability constant of the .sup.225 Ac complex through common
        spectroscopic or potentiometric titration methods. Accordingly,
        a competition extraction method was utilized to ascertain
        relative extraction constants of Ac.sup.3+ by
        calix[4]arene-tetracarboxylic acid and
        calix[6]arene-hexacarboxylic acid with respect to the water
        soluble ligand EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid). The
        competition experiment was as follows. First, .sup.225 Ac.sup.3+
        (in water at pH 7) was extracted into a chloroform phase
        containing calix[4]arene-tetracarboxylic acid or
        calix[6]arene-hexacarboxylic acid. The organic base was then
        back-extracted with an aqueous phase containing EDTA at pH 7. A
        distribution ratio D was calculated as [AcLH].sub.org
        /[AcEDTA].sub.Aq, where L is either
        calix[4]arene-tetracarboxylic acid or
        calix[6]arene-hexacarboxylic acid, and where LH is a protonated
        form of either calix[4]arene-tetracarboxylic acid or
        calix[6]arene-hexacarboxylic acid. ##EQU1## </p>
      <p>It is assumed that neither EDTA.sup.4- and AcEDTA.sup.- is
        soluble in a chloroform phase. The solubility of the HL.sup.3-
        and AcLH in the aqueous phase is neglected. A plot of log(D)
        versus log[EDTA.sup.4- ]/[HL.sup.3- ] </p>
      <p>is shown in FIG. 13. The plot has straight line slopes for both
        ligands of about 1, indicating that the above-described
        assumptions are good. (Specifically, the data of the first
        series fits the equation y=-1.0411x+0.0472, with R.sup.2
        =0.9981, and the data of the second series fits the equation
        y=-1.1317x+0.7616, with R.sup.2 =0.9925.) From the intercepts of
        the slopes in FIG. 13, the extraction constants of the ligands
        calix[4]arene-tetracarboxylic acid and
        calix[6]arene-hexacarboxylic acid are determined relative to
        that of EDTA. Calix[4]arene-tetracarboxylic acid is determined
        to have a K.sub.2 equal to 1.11 K.sub.1, where K.sub.1 is the
        extraction constant of Ac with EDTA.
        Calix[6]arene-hexacarboxylic acid is determined to have a
        K.sub.2 equal to 5.75 K.sub.1. </p>
      <p>It was also investigated whether the Ac.sup.3+ complexes with
        calix[4]arene-tetracarboxylic acid and
        calix[6]arene-hexacarboxylic acid were stable in the presence of
        high concentrations of alkaline, alkaline earth, and zinc metal
        ions. Aliquots of an organic phase containing the .sup.225 Ac
        complexes were back-extracted with an aqueous solution
        containing a mixture of 10 mM each of Ca.sup.2+, Mg.sup.2+,
        Na.sup.+, K.sup.+, and Zn.sup.2+ at pH 7.0. After shaking for
        five hours, calix[4]arene-tetracarboxylic acid shows no
        measurable loss of Ac.sup.3+ from the organic phase to the
        aqueous phase. Further, calix[6]arene-hexacarboxylic acid shows
        a loss of only about 5% of Ac.sup.3+ from the organic phase to
        the aqueous phase. The selective extraction of the trivalent
        Ac.sup.3+ over the monovalent ions and divalent ions by the
        ligands calix[4]arene-tetracarboxylic acid and
        calix[6]arene-hexacarboxylic acid may be related to the high
        charge density of the Ac.sup.3+ ion. The slightly poorer
        selectivity for Ac.sup.3+ of calix[6]arene-hexacarboxylic acid
        relative to calix[4]arene-tetracarboxylic acid may be due to the
        calix[4]arene having a more rigid cavity than the larger cavity
        of calix[6]arene. Also, as the calix[6]arene-hexacarboxylic acid
        is more acidic than the calix[4]arene-tetracarboxylic acid, it
        can coordinate with alkaline earth metal ions at lower pH
        values. </p>
      <p>The above experiments indicate that the
        calix[n]arene-carboxylic acids of the present invention can bind
        and retain Ac.sup.3+ at physiological pHs. Further, the
        experiments indicate that calix[n]arene-carboxylic acids of the
        present invention can bind and retain Ac.sup.3+ in environments
        containing a number of ions and salts, such as in vivo in
        biological systems. Accordingly, the calix[n]arene-carboxylic
        acids of the present invention are well suited for in vivo
        delivery of Ac.sup.3+ to target destinations, such as cancer
        cells. The above experiments also suggest that calix[n]arene
        compounds derivatized with other ionizable groups besides
        carboxylic acids, such as, for example, hydroxamic acids, can
        also selectively bind Ac.sup.3+ under physiological conditions.
      </p>
      <p>For treatments of cancer, .sup.225 Ac is a particularly
        effective radionuclide because .sup.225 Ac generates alpha
        particles during its decay series to .sup.209 Bi(stable). Alpha
        particles are generally more lethal to cells than beta particles
        (electrons), X-rays, or gamma rays generated by radioactive
        processes, and so are preferred particles for killing cancer
        cells. A decay scheme for Ac-225 is shown in FIG. 14. The decay
        scheme shows that .sup.225 Ac generates four alpha particles
        during its decay to .sup.209 Bi. </p>
      <p>Ac-225 has an optimum physical half life for in vivo treatment
        of cancer. Specifically, the physical half life of Ac-225 is
        about 10 days. Recent studies indicate that a relatively long
        physical half life (four to 12 days) of an alpha emitter is most
        desirable for in vivo cancer treatment. Specifically, recent
        dosimetry modeling by Rao and Howell showed that alpha emitters
        were preferable to beta emitters for therapy effectiveness, and
        that the optimum physical half life of the radionuclide is one
        to three times the biological retention half-time of a
        radiolabeled antibody in a tumor. (See, Rao and Howell,
        Time-Dose Fractionation in Radioimmunotherapy: Implications to
        Selection of Radionuclides, J. Nucl. Med. 34(5): 105 p (1993):
        and Rao and Howell, Time-Dose Fractionation in
        Radioimmunotherapy: Implications for Selection Radionuclides, J.
        Nucl. Med. 34: 1801-1810 (1993).) The pharmacokinetics of
        continuous protein uptake in some targeted solid tumors extend
        over periods of time and the biological retention half-times of
        some antibodies in tumors may be long (four to six days).
        Typical tumor retention half-times are 48 to 96 hours (two to
        four days), and therefore optimal physical half-lives are two to
        12 days, with longer half-times being preferred over shorter
        half-times. </p>

      <p>This paper describes a method of synthesizing metal
        nanoparticles in supercritical carbon dioxide using
        microemulsion as a nanoreactor and a template. Supercritical
        carbon dioxide is considered a green solvent and has many
        advantages over conventional organic solvents for chemical
        reactions and syntheses. Making nanoparticles in supercritical
        fluids and exploring their potential applications in novel
        materials fabrication and as catalysts for chemical reactions is
        of great interest to many scientists at the present time. This
        paper uses a water-in-CO2&nbsp; microemulsion to control the
        size of metal nanoparticles synthesized by chemical reduction of
        metal ions dissolved in the water core of the microemulsion. The
        formation of the nanoparticles was monitored spectroscopically
        using a high-pressure fiber optic cell and a CCD array UV-Vis
        spectrometer. The results and the techniques described in this
        paper are very useful for other investigators in starting their
        research in nanomaterials synthesis in supercritical fluids. Now
        many papers are published every year regarding nanomaterials
        synthesis in supercritical fluids and this paper is often cited
        as one of the pioneering studies in this area. </p>

      <p><b>Abstract:</b> Reverse micelles and microemulsions formed in
        liquid and supercritical carbon dioxide (CO2) allow highly polar
        or polarizable compounds to be dispersed in this non-polar
        fluid. However, since the polarizability per unit volume of
        dense CO2 is quite low, it is difficult to overcome the strong
        Van der Waals attractive interactions between particles in order
        to stably suspend macromolecular species. Conventional
        surfacants by themselves do not form reverse micelles or
        microemulsions in CO2 because the Van der Waals inter-droplet
        attractions are too high. The use of surfactants or
        cosurfactants with fluorinated tails provides a layer of a
        weakly attractive compound covering the highly attractive
        droplet cores thus preventing their short-range interactions
        that would destabilize the system. Using this strategy, we
        describe a method to synthesize and stabilize metallic silver
        nanoparticles having diameters from 5 to 15 nm in supercritical
        CO2 using an optically transparent, water-in-CO2 microemulsion.</p>

      <p><b>Abstract --&nbsp; </b>In order to investigate the
        effectiveness of ligand-assisted supercritical fluid extraction
        for the removal of transuranic contamination from soils an TNEEL
        silty-clay soil sample wasobtained from near the 13WMC area and
        subjected to three different chemical preparations before being
        spiked with plutonium. The spiked INEEL soil samples were
        subjected to a sequential aqueous extraction procedure to
        determine ‘radionuclide partitioning in each sample. Results
        from those extractions demonstrate that plutonium consistently
        partitioned into the residual fraction across all three INEEL
        soil preparations whereas americium partitioned 73% into the
        irordmanganese fraction for soil preparation A, with the balance
        partitioning into the residual fraction., Americium partitioned
        80% into the iron/manganese fraction for soil reparation B, with
        10% partitioning into the organic fraction and the balance
        partitioning into the residual fraction. Americium partitioned
        77% into the iron/manganese fraction for soil preparation C,
        with 22% in the organic phase and the balance in the carbonate
        fraction. Plutonium and americium were extracted from the INEEL
        soil samples using a Jigand-assisted supercritical fluid
        extraction technique. ‘ Initial supercritical fluid extraction-
        runs produced plutonium extraction efficiencies ranging from
        14°A to 19Y0. After a second round wherein the initial
        extraction parameters were changed, the plutonium extraction
        efficiencies increased to 60% and as high as 80% with the
        americium level in the post-extracted soil samples dropping near
        to the detection limits. The third round of experiments are
        currently underway. These results demonstrate that the
        Iigand-assisted supercritical fluid extraction technique can
        effectively extract plutonium from the spiked IN EEL soil
        preparations </p>
