              mounted diagonally from grounded electrodes. The form
              (e.g., a cube) was mounted upright and aligned East-West.
              1000 to 5000 KV of positive charge (per meter of electrode

        ( 21 Jul 1998 ) </p>
      <p>Hi all, and wow ! After all those years, I finally met Mr
        Jacques Ravatin. Just got back from the meeting, and
        oh-boy-am-I-thrilled ! Now, the name is probably unknown outside
        of France, but wait... I kept hearing about Ravatin, his group
        Ark'Hall (now named Eurek'All), his books (some of them under
        the pseudonym of Vladimir Rosgnilk), his theories and
        experiments... He is a 63 years old mathematician and physician,
        one foot in conventional university, the other in weird science
        BIG TIME - shape power, sacred geometry, lost technology,
        incredible devices that warp space-time... He dug out an
        impressive quantity of obscure patents and forgotten inventors,
        some of them you all know (like Keely, Lakhovsky, Schauberger),
        some others you probably don't (like Leon Sprink, Louis Boutard,
        Max Picard). He experimented with the Leon Sprink device, an
        orthogonal electromagnetic array that, correctly oriented,
        produces spectacular and very weird antigravific and
        bio-chemical effects. Sprink died in poverty in the early
        1970's. There are patents for his devices, rumour said the
        patents mysteriously disappeared, but Ravatin just told me the
        rumours are crap and the patents are still available. I'll have
        to check that at I.N.P.I., the French patent office... Stay in
        tune ! </p>
      <p>To put it very briefly, it was 4 metal point-like electrodes,
        disposed on the 4 corners of a square box (of non-conducting
        material - Balsa wood was often used), polarity opposite across
        the diagonals (diagonal size 30 centimeters of 1 meter), linked
        to a DC high tension generator (5000 to 160000 volts, depending
        on model size and desired effect). Effects were felt all around
        the devices (at 10 or 60 m distance) : accelerating industrial
        chemical reaction like cement making ("clinkerisation"),
        saponification (soap from fats), and metal ores reduction. For
        the big device with the weirdest anti-gravific effects, the
        Sprink created a cumulating effect by running the device for
        days (15 days to 2 months) : concentric zones of influence would
        slowly unfurl, violet light would be visible along the diagonals
        ("St-Andreas crosses") and the influence would persist for days
        after the current was switched off ! Influence is claimed to be
        dramatic on all sorts of chemical reactions and also reactions
        of changing states of matter, like fusion, dissolution,
        cristallisation, pectisation, coagulation... The Sprink reckoned
        they achieved zones of "activation" (adding that this expression
        was purely an analogy, as &amp;quotthe scientific nature of the
        phenomena cannot be precisely and rigorously defined at this
        time by the inventors"). </p>

        <p><b><font size="+1">METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR EXERTING AN
              INFLUENCE ON REACTIONS AND CHANGES IN THE STATE OF MATTER</font></b>
        </p>
        <p><b>1959-08-04</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>This invention relates to an improved method and apparatus for
        use in the treatment of matter for the purpose of changing its
        state, and more particularly is directed to a novel method and
        apparatus adapted to influence the changes which take place
        during chemical reactions, combinations and dissociations, and
        further those treatments in which the chemical composition is
        not modified, such as fusions, dissolutions, vaporizations,
        crystallizations, pectizations, coagulations, etc. </p>
      <p>It has now been discovered that treatment of the kind
        mentioned, when carried out in an electrically generated field,
        or activated space of a type to be more fully explained later,
        the normally expected results are materially influences in a
        desired manner, such electrically generated field or activated
        space being obtained by an apparatus, remote from the apparatus
        in which the material to be treated is contained, which
        comprises a minimum of two sets of opposed electrodes of
        opposite polarity positioned so as to cause the flow of
        electrical influences of the two sets to meet at a common point
        as more particularly pointed out hereinafter. </p>
      <p>By use of such apparatus and the field thus generated novel and
        unexpected results have been obtained in the treatment of
        materials at points substantially removed from the generating
        apparatus. </p>
      <p>We have previously described a method and apparatus capable of
        exerting an influence on chemical reactions which method
        consisted in locating the reacting medium into an earthed
        container which itself was paced into an electrostatic field, an
        electrical connection between said medium and the outer
        atmosphere being provided by means of an insulated electrode. </p>
      <p>Our works and experiments have enabled us to make it clear
        that, if some results can be obtained with such previous
        dispositions, these results are not the same nor are they
        regular because of the changes in the internal equilibrium of
        the materials in reaction inside the apparatus, they depend upon
        various influences outside the apparatuses and cannot be applied
        to a large number of industrial problems. </p>
      <p>On the contrary, with method and apparatuses according to our
        present invention, it becomes possible to obtain improved and
        novel results which are regular and of an easier industrial
        realization. </p>
      <p>According to a first object of our invention we exert such an
        action in locating said medium in the neighborhood but apart
        from an apparatus, giving out two or more beams of corpuscles
        more particularly corpuscles carrying charges like electrons by
        means of at least two sets of opposed electrodes of opposite
        polarity positioned so that the said beams will meet in a
        localized zone of space. That localized zone becomes the center
        of phenomena, hereinafter called ‘activation of space
        phenomena’, which cause modification in reactions and changes of
        state of matter. </p>
      <p>Another object of our invention consists in the step of
        orienting that geometrical figure formed by the apparatus in
        such a direction with regard to the magnetic north as to obtain
        the most satisfactory results, which direction will be dependent
        on the intended operation. </p>
      <p>By varying the direction or the conditions of the emission of
        corpuscles, such as the position, dimensions or forms of the
        apparatus and of the electrical conditions under which it is to
        work, it will be possible to modify the character or the
        direction of the activation and this, bring about various
        effects such as speeding up, stabilization, or alteration, in
        the change of state of matter. </p>
      <p>According to another feature of the invention, instead of
        placing the reacting medium under the influence of an
        electrostatic field, i.e., between the plates of the apparatus
        creating that electrostatic field, we localize it apart or even
        remote from the zone where the meeting of the aforesaid
        corpuscle beams is made to occur, the ranges of distances from
        this zone which are effective being selected according to the
        operation to be performed. </p>
      <p>According to another feature of the invention, te geometrical
        figure formed by the emitting apparatus is oriented relative to
        the magnetic field of the earth in a direction which depends
        upon the operation to be performed. </p>
      <p>Moreover, we have established that if reactions or changes of
        state of matter are subjected, for instance, to the action of
        certain corpuscles carrying charges, more particularly by taking
        steps as will be explained hereinafter, the effect produced when
        these electrical phenomena are applied is comparatively small
        and sometimes may be negligible altogether; but tat on the other
        hand, if their application is sustained continuously over a long
        period. For instance over 15 days to 2 months, there will be a
        progressive setting up of concentric areas around the apparatus,
        in which the space has taken on properties of activation and if
        the matter or reactive mixture is brought int these areas, under
        normal conditions of temperature, pressure, etc., the speeds of
        reaction or changes of state are influences to a very high
        degree by the mere fact that they take place in the activated
        space. This influence persists even after interruption of the
        electric circuit that is the source of activation, so that the
        area remains activated, and this activation only fades out after
        an appreciable time after the cessation of the electrical
        impulse that brought it about. </p>
      <p>Consequently, in accordance with the invention, the next step
        consists in activating the working space of the equipment in
        which the reactions or changes of state are to occur, well in
        advance of the beginning of the actual activation; the influence
        on the change of state of the matter will take place when the
        required period and degree of activation will be reached, and
        then, during the whole duration of the treatments contemplated.
      </p>
      <p>It must be remarked that the required strength of activation
        varies according to the character of the reactions or changes of
        state in question and that the effect sought for only builds up
        from the moment when this degree of activation is reached. A
        decision will be made, according to this required degree, in
        regard to the characteristics of the equipment productive of the
        activation phenomenon and more particularly with reference to
        the voltage at the electrodes of the apparatus and their
        distances to the point where the reaction or change of state is
        to take place. </p>
      <p>As an example and without this declaration being regarded as
        imposing any restriction to the invention, it may be pointed out
        that in the manufacture of cement utilizing the formation of
        clinker as a constituent step a sufficient degree activation of
        the space has been obtained, at the end of 5 weeks at a distance
        of 50 meters from a productive apparatus working under a voltage
        of 50,000 volts. </p>
      <p>It should be observed, in what has gone before, that the words
        ‘activation of space; must only be taken in the sense of their
        likeness in function but not in origin, since the scientific
        character of the established phenomenon cannot be clearly
        defined, at the present time with a strict degree of exactitude.
      </p>
      <p>The invention comprises, further, means for effecting this
        activation of the space which means will be hereinafter
        described in detail with reference to the annexed illustrative
        drawings which show diagrammatically only some examples of
        realization of our invention and which cannot be considered as a
        limitation. </p>
      <p><b>Fig. 1</b> is a diagram of an embodiment of the apparatus. </p>

      <center>
        <p><img src="ca-fig2.jpg" height="604" width="422"></p>
      </center>
      <p>Referring to these drawings, it will be made clearer that our
        invention can be performed through the medium of the following
        new and improved means: </p>
      <p>(a) First of all the intended activation will be obtained by
        means of emissive apparatuses suitably headed such as electrodes
        arranged in couples and distributed along the diagonal lines of
        geometric figures such as square, rectangles, rhombi, cubes,
        prisms, etc. </p>
      <p>Use may be made more particularly for the formation of these
        emissive apparatuses , of a frame carrying a certain number of
        fine metal points arranged in sets of four at the vertices of a
        square and connected respectively in sets of two to opposite
        poles of a voltage supply. </p>
      <p>Thus, for example, as on the embodiment shown in Fig. 1, 1 is a
        DC generator at high voltage of which the negative pole is
        earthed at 2, the frame of non-conducting material acting as
        carrier for four conducting points 4 arranged at the vertices of
        a square A,B,C,D, these points 4 being connected in pairs by
        conductors 5 to the two poles of the generator I, so that the
        points located respectively at the two ends of a diagonal line
        AC or BD are connected one to the positive pole and the other to
        the negative pole. </p>
      <p>(b) The productive apparatuses may be perfected by linking up
        the emissive electrodes (or equivalent) to one supply of DC
        voltage, preferably positive, the other being earthed. </p>
      <p>It will be possible, more particularly, to establish a positive
        direct voltage, although undulatory by connecting up emissive
        electrode through the medium of a rectifier on an alternating
        current main. </p>
      <p>(c) The emissive electrodes of one of the poles are connected
        to a suitable voltage supply (positive for instance) and the
        electrodes of opposite polarity to a natural or artificial body
        of water, in order to establish an electrical ground connection
        that is as near to perfection as is possible. </p>
      <p>(d) The set of emissive electrodes of the generator are
        arranged in one or more planes according to a fixed direction;
        the latter depends on the position and may depend likewise on
        the character of the reaction or change of state contemplated,
        as well as the effect wanted. <b>For the speeding up of
          reactions</b> such as the manufacture of cement with clinker
        as a constituent, the manufacture of lime, or saponification, <b>the
best
direction


          will be substantially that of the plane at right angles to the
          direction of magnetic north</b> at the place in question. </p>
      <p>In accordance with our invention, the electrodes may be
        arranged on a swiveling frame; change of direction will permit,
        in fact, the character of the activation of the space to be
        varied and consequently to alter the influence exercised on the
        changes of state or reactions. </p>
      <p>(e) Certain points on apparatus may be shielded from the effect
        of activation mentioned above, although they are in the
        activated area, by means of screens or jackets of insulating
        material; this insulating material will be preferably rubber or
        resinous material. The inventors have established, in fact, that
        the metals, wood, structural material (bricks, stone, cement)
        are pervious to the phenomenon of space activation, while rubber
        apparently presents an impassable barrier. </p>
      <p>It may be possible, more particularly, in accordance with the
        invention, to set up apparatus in restricted areas by furnishing
        such apparatus with impervious walls or partitions of suitable
        shape made of rubber or resinous materials. </p>
      <p>For the practical use of our method, one will take the
        following steps: </p>
      <p>The apparatus, such as that shown in Fig. 1, or its equivalent
        is set up at a point 6 (Fig. 2), located apart from the kilns or
        other apparatus 7,8,9,10,11, in which the reactions to be
        influenced are performed. That distance may practically vary
        from about three meters for the most proximate kilns to sixty
        meters and even more according to the power of the apparatus 6;
        the latter is oriented so that the plane x-x formed by the
        electrodes is substantially perpendicular to the Magnetic North
        direction. </p>
      <p>When the voltage has been set up for a protracted time, the
        influence of the inventive apparatus becomes noticeable on the
        nearer kilns, for example on those which are inside a perimeter
        represented in dotted lines at 12 (Fig. 2); then the effect
        extends progressively to the farther kilns, in zones concentric
        to the apparatus 6, to a limit which depends among other things
        on the character of the reactions and the power of the
        apparatus. </p>
      <p>The invention, of course, is in no way restricted to the method
        of realization as illustrated and described which is only given
        as an example. </p>
      <p>For example, instead of making use of four electrodes, use
        might be made of eight points arranged at the vertices of a
        cube. </p>
      <p>Such a device may be employed for the speeding up of various
        reactions as shown in the following examples: </p>
      <p><b>Example I</b> </p>
      <p>Use has been made of four points 4 of which the distance
        diagonally (AC or BD) between the points was 0.50 meter. The
        voltage supplied by the generator 1 was 5000 volts. The
        apparatus placed inside a house was arranged in the proximity of
        a set of autoclaves employed for the saponification of fatty
        substances. The distance from the apparatus to each of the
        autoclaves was 3 to 10 meters according to the position of the
        latter. One month after the setting in operation of the
        apparatus, the duration of the reaction, which normally is 24
        hours, had fallen down to 3 hours and the saving in calories to
        be supplied for the reaction was 50%. </p>
      <p><b>Example II</b> </p>
      <p>Use has been made of four points of which the distance
        diagonally between points was 1 meter; the voltage supplied was
        60,000 volts. The apparatus was arranged in the proximity of a
        set of four vertical kilns employed for the manufacture of
        hydraulic lime; these kilns were loaded during 8 hours by day;
        the distance from the apparatus to each of the kilns was about 3
        to 60 meters according to the position of the carious kilns. Two
        months after the setting in operation of the apparatus, for a
        charge of 626, 634 kg of lime ore and 79, 945 kg of coal
        (calorific value 4460 calories) we have extracted from the kilns
        447, 091 kg of lime which corresponds to a rate of 790 calories
        per kilogram of unslaked lime obtained instead of the usual rate
        of 1200 calories for the same quantity of lime. </p>
      <p><b>Example III</b> </p>
      <p>Similar results have been obtained in laboratory experiments
        during tests relating to the reduction of ores, such as ores of
        iron, aluminum… by making one of the four points of which the
        distance from the apparatus to the laboratory kilns varies from
        3 to 50 meters and the voltage applies being 160,000 volts. </p>

        <b>Method of and Apparatus for Carrying out Chemical Reactions</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Abstract ---</b> The zone in which chemical reactions are
        carried out, under conditions of temperature and pressure normal
        to the reactions, is subjected to the influence of crossing
        fluxes produced in a place at right angles to the horizontal
        component of the earth's magnetic field, each of the fluxes
        being produced by a silent electric discharge across two
        opposing pointed electrodes having a potential diffierence of
        1,000 to 160,000 volts derived from a source of direct current,
        the reactants being outside the paths of the fluxes. Examples
        relate to the saponification of tri-stearic with super-heated
        steam, the production of cement and the reduction of iron and
        aluminium ores, the reactions in each case being carried out in
        reactors which, according to their position, are 3 to 60 metres
        from the apparatus producing the fluxes, such apparatus having
        been in operation for 20 days before the reactions are
        commenced. ALSO: Cement is produced under normal conditions in
        kilns which are subjected to the influence of crossing fluxes
        produced in a plane at right angles to the horizontal component
        of the earth's magnetic field, each of the fluxes being produced
        by silent electric discharges between two opposing pointed
        electrodes having a potential difference of 1,000-160,000 volts
        derived from a source of direct current, the cement kilns being
        outside the paths of the fluxes. The apparatus for producing the
        fluxes is operated continuously for twenty days before cement
        making is commenced, the reaction time then being reduced from 2
        1/2 hours to one hour. </p>
