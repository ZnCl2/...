        <p> <b><i>Leon Sprink</i> was a Russian engineer who operated a
            cement manufacturing plant in France circa 1950. He received
            several patents for a simple method to create a type of
            electric field that accelerates chemical reactions.</b><br>
          <br>
          <b>In one example given by Sprink, “One month after the
            setting in operation of the apparatus, the duration of the
            reaction, which normally is 24 hours, had fallen down to 3
            hours and the saving in calories to be supplied for the
            reaction was 50%… The field also affects the states of
            matter such as solubility and crystallization, distillation,
            reduction of metallic ores, etc..."</b><br>
          <br>
          <b>In the simplest form of the invention, Sprink used a
            grounded container placed in an electrostatic field. More
            control and power was obtained with geometric arrays of
            positive electrodes mounted diagonally from grounded
            electrodes.</b> </p>

        <p><b>According to Sprink’s British Patent # 685,522,&nbsp;
            "Method of and Apparatus for Carrying out Chemical Reactions
            --- The set of emissive electrodes of the generator are
            arranged in one or more planes according to a fixed
            direction; the latter depends on the position and may depend
            likewise on the character of the reaction or change of state
            contemplated, as well as the effect wanted. For the speeding
            up of reactions such as the manufacture of cement with
            clinker as a constituent, the manufacture of lime, or
            saponification, the best direction will be substantially
            that of the plane at right angles to the direction of
            magnetic north at the place in question…</b></p>

        <p><b>"Cement is produced under normal conditions in kilns which
            are subjected to the influence of crossing fluxes produced
            in a plane at right angles to the horizontal component of

            produced by silent electric discharges between two opposing
            pointed electrodes having a potential difference of
            1,000-160,000 volts derived from a source of direct current,

            apparatus for producing the fluxes is operated continuously

        <p><b>According to Leon Sprink, "The zone in which chemical
            reactions are carried out, under conditions of temperature
            and pressure normal to the reactions, is subjected to the
            influence of crossing fluxes produced in a place at right
            angles to the horizontal component of the earth's magnetic
            field, each of the fluxes being produced by a silent
            electric discharge across two opposing pointed electrodes
            having a potential difference of 1,000 to 160,000 volts
            derived from a source of direct current, the reactants being
            outside the paths of the fluxes. Examples relate to the
            saponification of tri-stearic with super-heated steam, the
            production of cement and the reduction of iron and aluminium
            ores, the reactions in each case being carried out in
            reactors which, according to their position, are 3 to 60
            metres from the apparatus producing the fluxes, such
            apparatus having been in operation for 20 days before the
            reactions are commenced.</b> </p>
        <p><b>Large units also allegedly demonstrated
            "anti-gravitational" effects, and ultraviolet light became
            visible in the diagonals between the electrodes. Sprink
            called them “St. Andreas crosses”. By varying the position
            or form of the apparatus, various effects were obtained,
            “such as speeding up, stabilization, or alteration, in the
            change of state of matter”. The electrodes are “arranged in
            couples and distributed along the diagonal lines of
            geometric figures such as square, rectangles, rhombi, cubes,
            prisms, etc.” Rectified AC may be used.</b> </p>
        <p><b>Sprink’s associate Jacques Ravatin received French Patent
            # 2,421,531 for his similar “Apparatus for Amplifying
            Emissions Due to Shapes... The apparatus comprises a
            polygonal frame with sixteen sides, with four electrodes to
            generate a very high electric field inside the frame . After
            half an hour, effects on certain physical parameters occur
            within a radius of several tens of meters : action on the
            earth magnetic field, the gravitation, the air refraction

            shielding with rubber or resin. Metals, wood, and structural
            material (viz., bricks, stone, cement) are pervious to the
            phenomenon of space activation. The Russian astrophysicist

          ( 21 Jul 1998 ) </p>
        <p>Hi all, and wow ! After all those years, I finally met Mr
          Jacques Ravatin. Just got back from the meeting, and
          oh-boy-am-I-thrilled ! Now, the name is probably unknown
          outside of France, but wait... I kept hearing about Ravatin,
          his group Ark'Hall (now named Eurek'All), his books (some of
          them under the pseudonym of Vladimir Rosgnilk), his theories
          and experiments... He is a 63 years old mathematician and
          physician, one foot in conventional university, the other in
          weird science BIG TIME - shape power, sacred geometry, lost
          technology, incredible devices that warp space-time... He dug
          out an impressive quantity of obscure patents and forgotten
          inventors, some of them you all know (like Keely, Lakhovsky,
          Schauberger), some others you probably don't (like Leon
          Sprink, Louis Boutard, Max Picard). He experimented with the
          Leon Sprink device, an orthogonal electromagnetic array that,
          correctly oriented, produces spectacular and very weird
          antigravific and bio-chemical effects. Sprink died in poverty
          in the early 1970's. There are patents for his devices, rumour
          said the patents mysteriously disappeared, but Ravatin just
          told me the rumours are crap and the patents are still
          available. I'll have to check that at I.N.P.I., the French
          patent office... Stay in tune ! </p>
        <p>To put it very briefly, it was 4 metal point-like electrodes,
          disposed on the 4 corners of a square box (of non-conducting
          material - Balsa wood was often used), polarity opposite
          across the diagonals (diagonal size 30 centimeters of 1
          meter), linked to a DC high tension generator (5000 to 160000
          volts, depending on model size and desired effect). Effects
          were felt all around the devices (at 10 or 60 m distance) :
          accelerating industrial chemical reaction like cement making
          ("clinkerisation"), saponification (soap from fats), and metal
          ores reduction. For the big device with the weirdest
          anti-gravific effects, the Sprink created a cumulating effect
          by running the device for days (15 days to 2 months) :
          concentric zones of influence would slowly unfurl, violet
          light would be visible along the diagonals ("St-Andreas
          crosses") and the influence would persist for days after the
          current was switched off ! Influence is claimed to be dramatic
          on all sorts of chemical reactions and also reactions of
          changing states of matter, like fusion, dissolution,
          cristallisation, pectisation, coagulation... The Sprink
          reckoned they achieved zones of "activation" (adding that this
          expression was purely an analogy, as &amp;quotthe scientific
          nature of the phenomena cannot be precisely and rigorously
          defined at this time by the inventors"). </p>

                INFLUENCE ON REACTIONS AND CHANGES IN THE STATE OF

          <p><b>1959-08-04</b></p>
        </center>
        <p>This invention relates to an improved method and apparatus
          for use in the treatment of matter for the purpose of changing
          its state, and more particularly is directed to a novel method
          and apparatus adapted to influence the changes which take
          place during chemical reactions, combinations and
          dissociations, and further those treatments in which the
          chemical composition is not modified, such as fusions,
          dissolutions, vaporizations, crystallizations, pectizations,
          coagulations, etc. </p>
        <p>It has now been discovered that treatment of the kind
          mentioned, when carried out in an electrically generated
          field, or activated space of a type to be more fully explained
          later, the normally expected results are materially influences
          in a desired manner, such electrically generated field or
          activated space being obtained by an apparatus, remote from
          the apparatus in which the material to be treated is
          contained, which comprises a minimum of two sets of opposed
          electrodes of opposite polarity positioned so as to cause the
          flow of electrical influences of the two sets to meet at a
          common point as more particularly pointed out hereinafter. </p>
        <p>By use of such apparatus and the field thus generated novel
          and unexpected results have been obtained in the treatment of
          materials at points substantially removed from the generating
          apparatus. </p>
        <p>We have previously described a method and apparatus capable
          of exerting an influence on chemical reactions which method
          consisted in locating the reacting medium into an earthed
          container which itself was paced into an electrostatic field,
          an electrical connection between said medium and the outer
          atmosphere being provided by means of an insulated electrode.
        </p>
        <p>Our works and experiments have enabled us to make it clear
          that, if some results can be obtained with such previous
          dispositions, these results are not the same nor are they
          regular because of the changes in the internal equilibrium of
          the materials in reaction inside the apparatus, they depend
          upon various influences outside the apparatuses and cannot be
          applied to a large number of industrial problems. </p>
        <p>On the contrary, with method and apparatuses according to our
          present invention, it becomes possible to obtain improved and
          novel results which are regular and of an easier industrial
          realization. </p>
        <p>According to a first object of our invention we exert such an
          action in locating said medium in the neighborhood but apart
          from an apparatus, giving out two or more beams of corpuscles
          more particularly corpuscles carrying charges like electrons
          by means of at least two sets of opposed electrodes of
          opposite polarity positioned so that the said beams will meet
          in a localized zone of space. That localized zone becomes the
          center of phenomena, hereinafter called ‘activation of space
          phenomena’, which cause modification in reactions and changes
          of state of matter. </p>
        <p>Another object of our invention consists in the step of
          orienting that geometrical figure formed by the apparatus in
          such a direction with regard to the magnetic north as to
          obtain the most satisfactory results, which direction will be
          dependent on the intended operation. </p>
        <p>By varying the direction or the conditions of the emission of
          corpuscles, such as the position, dimensions or forms of the
          apparatus and of the electrical conditions under which it is
          to work, it will be possible to modify the character or the
          direction of the activation and this, bring about various
          effects such as speeding up, stabilization, or alteration, in
          the change of state of matter. </p>
        <p>According to another feature of the invention, instead of
          placing the reacting medium under the influence of an
          electrostatic field, i.e., between the plates of the apparatus
          creating that electrostatic field, we localize it apart or
          even remote from the zone where the meeting of the aforesaid
          corpuscle beams is made to occur, the ranges of distances from
          this zone which are effective being selected according to the
          operation to be performed. </p>
        <p>According to another feature of the invention, te geometrical
          figure formed by the emitting apparatus is oriented relative
          to the magnetic field of the earth in a direction which
          depends upon the operation to be performed. </p>
        <p>Moreover, we have established that if reactions or changes of
          state of matter are subjected, for instance, to the action of
          certain corpuscles carrying charges, more particularly by
          taking steps as will be explained hereinafter, the effect
          produced when these electrical phenomena are applied is
          comparatively small and sometimes may be negligible
          altogether; but tat on the other hand, if their application is
          sustained continuously over a long period. For instance over
          15 days to 2 months, there will be a progressive setting up of
          concentric areas around the apparatus, in which the space has
          taken on properties of activation and if the matter or
          reactive mixture is brought int these areas, under normal
          conditions of temperature, pressure, etc., the speeds of
          reaction or changes of state are influences to a very high
          degree by the mere fact that they take place in the activated
          space. This influence persists even after interruption of the
          electric circuit that is the source of activation, so that the
          area remains activated, and this activation only fades out
          after an appreciable time after the cessation of the
          electrical impulse that brought it about. </p>
        <p>Consequently, in accordance with the invention, the next step
          consists in activating the working space of the equipment in
          which the reactions or changes of state are to occur, well in
          advance of the beginning of the actual activation; the
          influence on the change of state of the matter will take place
          when the required period and degree of activation will be
          reached, and then, during the whole duration of the treatments
          contemplated. </p>
        <p>It must be remarked that the required strength of activation
          varies according to the character of the reactions or changes
          of state in question and that the effect sought for only
          builds up from the moment when this degree of activation is
          reached. A decision will be made, according to this required
          degree, in regard to the characteristics of the equipment
          productive of the activation phenomenon and more particularly
          with reference to the voltage at the electrodes of the
          apparatus and their distances to the point where the reaction
          or change of state is to take place. </p>
        <p>As an example and without this declaration being regarded as
          imposing any restriction to the invention, it may be pointed
          out that in the manufacture of cement utilizing the formation
          of clinker as a constituent step a sufficient degree
          activation of the space has been obtained, at the end of 5
          weeks at a distance of 50 meters from a productive apparatus
          working under a voltage of 50,000 volts. </p>
        <p>It should be observed, in what has gone before, that the
          words ‘activation of space; must only be taken in the sense of
          their likeness in function but not in origin, since the
          scientific character of the established phenomenon cannot be
          clearly defined, at the present time with a strict degree of
          exactitude. </p>
        <p>The invention comprises, further, means for effecting this
          activation of the space which means will be hereinafter
          described in detail with reference to the annexed illustrative
          drawings which show diagrammatically only some examples of
          realization of our invention and which cannot be considered as
          a limitation. </p>
        <p><b>Fig. 1</b> is a diagram of an embodiment of the apparatus.

        <center>
          <p><img src="ca-fig2.jpg" height="604" width="422"></p>
        </center>
        <p>Referring to these drawings, it will be made clearer that our
          invention can be performed through the medium of the following
          new and improved means: </p>
        <p>(a) First of all the intended activation will be obtained by
          means of emissive apparatuses suitably headed such as
          electrodes arranged in couples and distributed along the
          diagonal lines of geometric figures such as square,
          rectangles, rhombi, cubes, prisms, etc. </p>
        <p>Use may be made more particularly for the formation of these
          emissive apparatuses , of a frame carrying a certain number of
          fine metal points arranged in sets of four at the vertices of
          a square and connected respectively in sets of two to opposite
          poles of a voltage supply. </p>
        <p>Thus, for example, as on the embodiment shown in Fig. 1, 1 is
          a DC generator at high voltage of which the negative pole is
          earthed at 2, the frame of non-conducting material acting as
          carrier for four conducting points 4 arranged at the vertices
          of a square A,B,C,D, these points 4 being connected in pairs
          by conductors 5 to the two poles of the generator I, so that
          the points located respectively at the two ends of a diagonal
          line AC or BD are connected one to the positive pole and the
          other to the negative pole. </p>
        <p>(b) The productive apparatuses may be perfected by linking up
          the emissive electrodes (or equivalent) to one supply of DC
          voltage, preferably positive, the other being earthed. </p>
        <p>It will be possible, more particularly, to establish a
          positive direct voltage, although undulatory by connecting up
          emissive electrode through the medium of a rectifier on an
          alternating current main. </p>
        <p>(c) The emissive electrodes of one of the poles are connected
          to a suitable voltage supply (positive for instance) and the
          electrodes of opposite polarity to a natural or artificial
          body of water, in order to establish an electrical ground
          connection that is as near to perfection as is possible. </p>
        <p>(d) The set of emissive electrodes of the generator are
          arranged in one or more planes according to a fixed direction;
          the latter depends on the position and may depend likewise on
          the character of the reaction or change of state contemplated,
          as well as the effect wanted. <b>For the speeding up of
            reactions</b> such as the manufacture of cement with clinker
          as a constituent, the manufacture of lime, or saponification,
          <b>the best direction will be substantially that of the plane
            at right angles to the direction of magnetic north</b> at
          the place in question. </p>
        <p>In accordance with our invention, the electrodes may be
          arranged on a swiveling frame; change of direction will
          permit, in fact, the character of the activation of the space
          to be varied and consequently to alter the influence exercised
          on the changes of state or reactions. </p>
        <p>(e) Certain points on apparatus may be shielded from the
          effect of activation mentioned above, although they are in the
          activated area, by means of screens or jackets of insulating
          material; this insulating material will be preferably rubber
          or resinous material. The inventors have established, in fact,
          that the metals, wood, structural material (bricks, stone,
          cement) are pervious to the phenomenon of space activation,
          while rubber apparently presents an impassable barrier. </p>
        <p>It may be possible, more particularly, in accordance with the
          invention, to set up apparatus in restricted areas by
          furnishing such apparatus with impervious walls or partitions
          of suitable shape made of rubber or resinous materials. </p>
        <p>For the practical use of our method, one will take the
          following steps: </p>
        <p>The apparatus, such as that shown in Fig. 1, or its
          equivalent is set up at a point 6 (Fig. 2), located apart from
          the kilns or other apparatus 7,8,9,10,11, in which the
          reactions to be influenced are performed. That distance may
          practically vary from about three meters for the most
          proximate kilns to sixty meters and even more according to the
          power of the apparatus 6; the latter is oriented so that the
          plane x-x formed by the electrodes is substantially
          perpendicular to the Magnetic North direction. </p>
        <p>When the voltage has been set up for a protracted time, the
          influence of the inventive apparatus becomes noticeable on the
          nearer kilns, for example on those which are inside a
          perimeter represented in dotted lines at 12 (Fig. 2); then the
          effect extends progressively to the farther kilns, in zones
          concentric to the apparatus 6, to a limit which depends among
          other things on the character of the reactions and the power
          of the apparatus. </p>
        <p>The invention, of course, is in no way restricted to the
          method of realization as illustrated and described which is
          only given as an example. </p>
        <p>For example, instead of making use of four electrodes, use
          might be made of eight points arranged at the vertices of a
          cube. </p>
        <p>Such a device may be employed for the speeding up of various
          reactions as shown in the following examples: </p>
        <p><b>Example I</b> </p>
        <p>Use has been made of four points 4 of which the distance
          diagonally (AC or BD) between the points was 0.50 meter. The
          voltage supplied by the generator 1 was 5000 volts. The
          apparatus placed inside a house was arranged in the proximity
          of a set of autoclaves employed for the saponification of
          fatty substances. The distance from the apparatus to each of
          the autoclaves was 3 to 10 meters according to the position of
          the latter. One month after the setting in operation of the
          apparatus, the duration of the reaction, which normally is 24
          hours, had fallen down to 3 hours and the saving in calories
          to be supplied for the reaction was 50%. </p>
        <p><b>Example II</b> </p>
        <p>Use has been made of four points of which the distance
          diagonally between points was 1 meter; the voltage supplied
          was 60,000 volts. The apparatus was arranged in the proximity
          of a set of four vertical kilns employed for the manufacture
          of hydraulic lime; these kilns were loaded during 8 hours by
          day; the distance from the apparatus to each of the kilns was
          about 3 to 60 meters according to the position of the carious
          kilns. Two months after the setting in operation of the
          apparatus, for a charge of 626, 634 kg of lime ore and 79, 945
          kg of coal (calorific value 4460 calories) we have extracted
          from the kilns 447, 091 kg of lime which corresponds to a rate
          of 790 calories per kilogram of unslaked lime obtained instead
          of the usual rate of 1200 calories for the same quantity of
          lime. </p>
        <p><b>Example III</b> </p>
        <p>Similar results have been obtained in laboratory experiments
          during tests relating to the reduction of ores, such as ores
          of iron, aluminum… by making one of the four points of which
          the distance from the apparatus to the laboratory kilns varies
          from 3 to 50 meters and the voltage applies being 160,000
          volts. </p>

          <b>Method of and Apparatus for Carrying out Chemical Reactions</b>
        </p>
        <p><b>Abstract ---</b> The zone in which chemical reactions are
          carried out, under conditions of temperature and pressure
          normal to the reactions, is subjected to the influence of
          crossing fluxes produced in a place at right angles to the
          horizontal component of the earth's magnetic field, each of
          the fluxes being produced by a silent electric discharge
          across two opposing pointed electrodes having a potential
          diffierence of 1,000 to 160,000 volts derived from a source of
          direct current, the reactants being outside the paths of the
          fluxes. Examples relate to the saponification of tri-stearic
          with super-heated steam, the production of cement and the
          reduction of iron and aluminium ores, the reactions in each
          case being carried out in reactors which, according to their
          position, are 3 to 60 metres from the apparatus producing the
          fluxes, such apparatus having been in operation for 20 days
          before the reactions are commenced. ALSO: Cement is produced
          under normal conditions in kilns which are subjected to the
          influence of crossing fluxes produced in a plane at right
          angles to the horizontal component of the earth's magnetic
          field, each of the fluxes being produced by silent electric
          discharges between two opposing pointed electrodes having a
          potential difference of 1,000-160,000 volts derived from a
          source of direct current, the cement kilns being outside the
          paths of the fluxes. The apparatus for producing the fluxes is
          operated continuously for twenty days before cement making is
          commenced, the reaction time then being reduced from 2 1/2
          hours to one hour. </p>
