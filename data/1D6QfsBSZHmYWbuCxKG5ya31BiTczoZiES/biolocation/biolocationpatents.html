        <b> RADIESTHESIA ROD</b><br>
      </div>
      Inventor: CRETU EUGEN VIOREL<br>
      The invention relates to a radiesthesia rod to be employed in
      biodetection, biolocation, measuring energetic and bioenergetic
      fields, diagnosing energetic anomalies, in qualitative and
      quantitative measurements, in all said applications the rod being
      used together with a special protractor. According to the
      invention, the radiesthesia rod consists of a cross-shaped
      assembly (1) made of metal wire along two perpendicular lines (D1
      and D2), where one line (D1) contains two wire pieces of equal
      sizes (b), welded in the extension of each other, while, along a
      line (D2) there are similarly welded two other wire pieces, one of
      them having a size (a) and the other one having other size (I),
      the two half sizes (b) of the first arm of the rod cross being
      welded or soldered to the rod arm having a size (a+I), where the
      assembly (1) works together with a special protractor (2).<br>
      <br>
      The invention relates to a radiosynthetic lance, which is used in
      biodetection, biolocation, energy and bioenergetic field
      measurements, diagnosis of energy abnormalities and qualitative
      and quantitative measurements.<br>
      <br>
      A radiosynthetic yarn is known, according to the patent RO 113710
      B1, shown in FIG. 3, which is used in biodetection, biolocation,
      diagnosis of energy abnormalities, as well as for various
      quantitative and qualitative measurements, used with a reporter.
      The ansa consists of a metallic thread 1 of copper, steel, nickel,
      or other material having sharp ends and located on the same axis,
      the two ends being connected by two uneven arms so that the
      distance between the longitudinal axis and the surface of the
      radiostatic reporter to be minimal and to be used with the
      radiostatic reporter 2.<br>
      <br>
      The drawbacks of the above-mentioned solution are that it is
      elastic and that it deforms uncontrollably between the two sharp
      ends during the period when it is held by the radiostatic operator
      for measurements, generating errors of measurement. This type of
      radial beam is made in such a way that the ends of the
      radioselease are chinar with the right D1, the right D1 being
      perpendicular to the right D2, which is also the axis of symmetry
      of the radioselease. Also, such a bisection, which is achieved by
      bending, has the drawback that it is complicated to be realized,
      requiring a special bending pattern of relatively complicated form
      because it requires bending with the radii of curvature r1, r2, r3
      and r4, on on one side, but also a radius of connection R with the
      horizontal portion of the radial anise. Another disadvantage of
      this type of radioset is that it is relatively difficult to
      balance, correlated with the diameter of the wire, due to the
      shape asymmetry. Reading errors may occur on the radiostatic
      reporter 2, because the direction of the indexing point (basically
      the pointing point) is equal to the width of the wire from which
      the yarn is made.<br>
      <br>
      There is also known a radioselastic bush, according to FIG. 1,
      which is made of a metallic thread 1, sharpened at the ends, which
      is used together with a radiostatic shaper 2. This type of radial
      beam is made so that the ends are chinar with the right D1, the
      right D1 being perpendicular to the right D2, which is the axis of
      symmetry of the radius.<br>
      <br>
      Hence, the first disadvantage of this loop is that it is elastic
      and consequently deforms uncontrollably between the two sharp
      edges while it is held by the radius operator for measurements,
      generating errors in measurement. The ansa is made by bending and
      has the drawback that it is relatively complicated to perform,
      requiring a special bending pattern of relatively complicated form
      because it requires bending with the radii of curvature r1, r2, r3
      and r4, on the one hand, and on the other has the drawback that
      due to the distance d1 between the radius tip peak and the
      radiosetting beam 2, the readings are made with large errors,
      especially in the case of quantitative measurements. All read
      errors on the radiostatic actuator 2 occur due to the fact that
      the point indicating zone (basically the pointing point) has a
      width equal to the diameter of the wire from which the yarn is
      made.<br>
      <br>
      There is also known a radioselastic bush, according to FIG. 2,
      which is Y-shaped and which is made of a metallic thread 1,
      sharpened at the ends, which is used in conjunction with a
      radiostatic shaper 2. The radioselease is made in such a way that
      the ends are chinar with the right D1, the right D1 being
      perpendicular to the right D2, which is also the axis of symmetry
      of the radius. The anchor is made by bending and has the
      disadvantage that it is relatively complicated to achieve,
      requiring a special bending pattern of relatively complicated form
      because it requires bending radii r1, r2, r3, r4, r5 and r6, on
      the one hand , and on the other hand, this radioside has the
      disadvantage that, due to the distance between the tip of the
      ankle and the specialty, the readings are made with large errors,
      especially in the case of quantitative measurements. Another
      drawback of this radiosynthetic feature is that it is elastic and
      consequently deforms uncontrollably between the two sharp edges
      during the period of time when the measuring radius is held by the
      operator, generating measurement errors.<br>
      <br>
      The technical problem solved by the invention consists in
      correcting errors in the measurement of the energy and
      bioenergetic fields, and in increasing the measuring speed and
      reducing the response time.<br>
      <br>
      According to the invention, the radiosetting nose solves the
      above-mentioned technical problem in that it consists of a
      metallic wire which is made by welding / gluing four arms after
      two perpendicular axes to obtain a cross shape.<br>
      <br>
      According to the invention, the radiosetting nose has the
      following advantages: - is easy to achieve; - does not require a
      special bending pattern; - it is easy to handle; - there are no
      deformations between the outlet ends; - has a high measurement
      accuracy; - is very well balanced; - can be used both indoors and
      outdoors under difficult weather conditions. <br>
      <br>
      The following is an example of the invention, with reference to
      FIG. 1 ... 4, which represents; <br>
      <br>
      FIG. 1 is a side view of a V-shaped radioset; <br>
      FIG. 2 is a side view of a Y-shaped radioselective sleeve; <br>
      FIG. 3 is a side view of a radial Y-shaped yoke with unequal arms;<br>
      FIG. 4 is a side elevational view of the radial anisotope
      according to the invention.<br>
      <br>
      According to the invention, the radial anase shown in FIG. 4 is
      made of a circular or square-shaped metallic thread 1, sharpened
      at the ends, which is made by welding / gluing of four arms 3, 4,
      5 and 6, after some axes D1 and D2 perpendicularly, in order to a
      cross form is obtained.<br>
      <br>
      The arms 3, 4, 5 and 6 have the dimensions a, b, c and I, where I
      represents the radius length and d represents the size for the
      metal wire section 1 from which the radiase (radius or square)
      radius is made.<br>
      <br>
      The two b-halves of the arms 3 and 4 are welded or glued to the
      arms 1 and 5 of the size a + I as shown in FIG. 4, resulting in
      the cross-sectional radial groove according to the invention.
      According to the invention, the two arms of the cross that
      represent the radial anise are obtained by welding or gluing the
      arms 3, 4, 5, 6 by two and are located on the perpendicular axes
      D1 and D2. On the D1 axis there is located a radius-like cross arm
      according to the invention, which contains the heads for the
      radioselease socket of the radiosesthetic operator, which is why
      these ends are sharp. On the D2 axis there is the other arm of the
      radius crosstalk, of length c, according to the invention, which
      is sharpened at one end, according to FIG. 4, thereby increasing
      the accuracy of the measurement by more accurately reading the
      radiostatic reporter 2. The dimension of the dimension b of FIG.
      4, chosen as the distance d1 from the radial shaft to the special
      shunt, must be as small as possible (the distance d1 is set to a
      minimum value for the measurement accuracy of the radius operator)
      correlated with the sharp end of the length arm c, of the
      radiosesthetic sleeve according to the invention makes the
      precision of the measurement superior to all the other variants of
      the radiosettes shown.<br>
      <br>
      It is noted that the radioshelical groove is easily achieved by
      welding or gluing, due to the rigid cross-section, hence the
      possibility to be easily executed in series production, it can be
      used very easily, without the possibility of deformations, after
      right D1 of the chassis between the outlet ends for the radiosist
      operator, eliminating other possible measurement errors, thereby
      also increasing measurement accuracy. According to the invention,
      for the radiosystaxes practiced according to the invention, the
      center of gravity is placed in such a way that the yarn is very
      well balanced and gives a very good stability of the radioselease
      to the use by the radiostatic operator both in the resting state
      and in the measurement process . For the same stability
      considerations, the radiosetting groove according to the invention
      can be used with excellent results both in closed enclosures and
      outdoors, even in difficult weather conditions (from rain, wind,
      etc.). Finally, it should be emphasized that this type of radial
      beam according to the invention has a very high response velocity
      in the measurement process, with respect to all of the
      radiosesthetic anodes shown above.<br>

      SUBSTANCE: method involves determining hydrochloric acid quantity
      required for human beings by applying biolocation method and
      taking the acid diluted to various concentrations. Hydrochloric
      acid reference value is calculated with age taken into account.
      The value being exceeded by more than 1, the external influence is
      considered to be negative one. EFFECT: simplified method.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;The method relates to the field of medicine and is intended
      for use in the diagnosis of human health.<br>
      The presence of external effects of biological objects on humans
      is established by various methods. For example, patent N 2021749
      MKI A G 1 B 5/00 "Method for determining the type of interaction
      between man and plant" provides for changing the angle of rotation
      of the frame to determine the type of interaction between man and
      tree. In this case, frames of various designs can be used, for
      example, patents N 2086174, 2049422, etc. A number of inventions
      (patent N 2045290, etc.) provides for bioenergy impact as an
      element of recovery.<br>
      <br>
      The negative impact of another biological object on a person is
      mainly assessed by the change in the biofield [Chernozub I.Ye.,
      Energovampiry. Protection and treatment, - M., Company "Ales" -
      1996 - 60 s]. The disadvantage of these methods is the possibility
      of its use only by bio-operators, at the same time, doctors do not
      always have the necessary abilities. The second equally important
      drawback is the lack of assessment in numerical terms, which is
      essential for the transfer of energy-information effects without
      significant changes in the biofield.<br>
      <br>
      Studies conducted in 1997-1999, allowed us to establish the
      dependence of the magnitude of external exposure and the needs of
      the body in hydrochloric acid.<br>
      <br>
      The need for hydrochloric acid was determined using a Biotest
      instrument using a biolocation method and using electromagnetic
      sensors that evaluate a person's field at various degrees of
      dilution (grinding) and was estimated in the number of homeopathic
      balls (300 balls weigh 10 g with filler).<br>
      <br>
      Research has shown that in the absence of external influences, the
      need for a person in hydrochloric acid depends on age and
      increases annually by 10 balls. Acidum muratum 6 dilutions. When
      using other dilutions in the specified amount (10 pcs.) Correction
      factors are introduced. For three hundred breeding - 0.3, for 12
      breeding - 2.8.<br>
      <br>
      The presence of external exposure Hb can be determined by the
      formula where Kf is the actual need for hydrochloric acid,
      determined in homeopathic balls, pieces. ; B - patient's age,
      years; p - correction factor depending on the dilution.<br>
      When HB&gt; 1, the presence of a negative external effect is
      established.<br>
      <br>
      The main advantage of this method is the possibility of an
      objective assessment, which will allow to widely introduce it into
      medical practice as a method of assessing and removing negative
      external influences.<br>
      <br>
      The closest analogue is a method of assessing a person’s overall
      health, which involves determining the general state of health by
      comparing the actual need for ammonia, but this method cannot be
      applied when assessing the magnitude of negative external
      influences, since the change in the need for ammonia occurs when
      the physical condition plan. At the initial stage, negative
      energy-informational impact is often not on the physical plane,
      and immediately after removal, the violation on the physical plane
      (if they already were) does not change and this process can be
      assessed only by the proposed method.<br>
      <br>
      The proposed method is as follows.<br>
      <br>
      Example.<br>
      <br>
      Patient S., age 49 years old, general weakness, irritability.<br>
      <br>
      The patient's need for hydrochloric acid was determined using
      homeopathic balls 6 dilution device Biotest - 1240 pcs.<br>
      <br>
      According to the formula (1), the magnitude of the external effect
      is Next, one of the known methods carried out removal of external
      effects, the patient's need for hydrochloric acid decreased to 490
      homeopathic balls 6 dilutions.<br>
      <br>
      By the formula This allows you to assess the quality of the
      elimination of external influence by an objective method. <br>

        <b> BIOLOCATION METHOD FOR DIAGNOSING OBJECT PATHOLOGY</b><br>
      </div>
      Inventor: PUCHKO L G<br>
      <br>
      SUBSTANCE: method involves building energy-information image of an
      object under investigation. Negative external energy-information
      influence types are selected as its components having the form of
      vortex structures, holographic solitons and their parameters that
      are distributed over a picture showing a circle divided by radii
      into equal sectors having corresponding soliton or its parameter
      displayed in each of them. A finger, or hair strand, or object
      photo are applied to the picture and then perceptive organ of an
      operator is fixed on initial point of the image like circle center
      of the semicircle. When recording ponderomotor operator response,
      solutions acting upon the object are determined together with
      their number and parameters by means of power indication unit to
      build a vibration series. <br>
      <br>
      The invention relates to medicine and can be used in diagnostic
      dowsing in determining the pathology of an object, in particular
      chronic human diseases.<br>
      <br>
      There is a method of biolocation diagnosis of the pathology of the
      object (RF patent N 2049422, IPC A 61 B 5/00, 1992), in which the
      operator performs diagnostics of the object (person) using an
      energy indicator, made in the form of a frame with a sensor of
      frame oscillations. The work of the energy indicator is based on
      the principle of interaction between the bioenergy fields of the
      operator and the object under study, which are located in the
      general information field of the surrounding space. The operator
      brings the energy indicator to the person and, entering the state
      of "trance", makes a request using special formulas. At the time
      of entry into the "trance", an electoral information channel is
      established between the operator and the object under study. In
      response to a request, the frame in the operator's hand begins to
      oscillate. If the answer is positive, the frame oscillates in a
      vertical plane, with a negative answer it oscillates in a
      horizontal plane. With equal positive and negative situations, the
      frame oscillates around the figure-eight, in transient situations
      the frame stands motionless.<br>
      <br>
      Frame oscillations on the oscilloscope screen are converted into
      graphics. By the nature of these graphs determine the energy state
      of the object.<br>
      <br>
      The disadvantage of this method of biolocation diagnosis of
      pathology of the object is to reduce the accuracy of diagnosis due
      to the possible displacement of the energy indicator from the
      human organ being investigated, due to insufficient operator
      skills, which require not only special training, but also the
      special qualities of a psychic.<br>
      <br>
      There is a method of biolocation diagnosis of pathology of the
      object (RF patent N 2086174, IPC A 61 B 5/00, 1995), in which the
      operator performs diagnostics of the object (person) using an
      energy indicator, made in the form of a frame containing a rod, at
      one end which is fixed disk with a hole, and at the other end - a
      handle. The operator, holding the frame handle in his hand, sets
      the disc with a hole at a distance of 10-15 cm from the internal
      organs of a person and asks a question about their state in the
      form of "yes" or "no." Under the question “yes”, the operator
      means that the internal organ under study is healthy and not
      subject to any diseases, the question “no” is that the internal
      organ is affected by the ailment. At the same time, the operator
      determines the symmetry of the human aura, based on the fact that
      a healthy organism (the human body) radiates a smooth aura, and
      the affected one - a distorted aura. To determine the uniformity
      of the aura or its asymmetry, the diagnostic frame passes over the
      entire body of a person at an equal distance from it.<br>
      <br>
      Determine the amplitude and direction of oscillation of the frame,
      which is judged, healthy or sick of a particular organ of a
      person. Usually, when checking a healthy organ, the frame
      oscillates in a vertical plane, and when checking an organ
      affected by a disease, the frame performs horizontal vibrations
      with varying frequency depending on the degree of the disease.
      Horizontal frame oscillations are caused by a violation of aura in
      a person by leptons that increase in the affected area of the
      organ. Vertical vibrations of the frame with a uniform frequency
      show that the aura of the body is not affected.<br>
      <br>
      The disadvantage of this method of biolocation diagnosis of
      pathology of the object is to reduce the accuracy of diagnosis due
      to the possible shift of the energy indicator from the test organ
      of a person.<br>
      <br>
      The closest set of essential features of the claimed invention is
      a method of biolocation diagnosis of object pathology (RF patent N
      2048146, IPC A 61 V 5/00, 1994), at which an energy-information
      image of the object being studied is created, the operator’s
      perceiving organ is fixed at the starting point of the image and
      registering the ponderomotive response of the operator’s
      perceiving organ through an energy indicator. For the
      implementation of this method, a set of reference values of the
      motion parameters of the operator’s perceiving organ is predefined
      for this type of object. So, when the number of oscillations from
      0 to 5 characterizes a strong hypofunction of the object under
      study, from 6 to 10 - hypofunction, from 11 to 35 - normal
      function, from 36 to 69 - hypofunction of another sign, more than
      70 - strong hypofunction of another sign. Acute pathology or acute
      chronic pathology for a bioobject is characterized by fluctuations
      with the number of more than 60, chronic processes without
      exacerbations - from 1 to 5.<br>
      <br>
      Then, on the digitizer plate in front of the operator, an
      energy-informational image of the object under study is formed,
      which contains several zones of the energy minimum, and the
      operator's perceiving organ (the operator's hand with the energy
      indicator) is fixed at the starting point of the
      energy-informational image of the object. Then move the perceiving
      organ to the zone of the first energy minimum and record the
      parameters of the oscillatory motion. Then they move to the next
      zone of the energy minimum in the formed image of the object and
      so on until the last zone, then the registration is repeated when
      passing from the last zone to the first one. As a result, studies
      have a set of numbers that characterize the state of each zone and
      the transition from zone to zone. The obtained results are
      compared with the reference values of the parameters for this
      object and, based on the result of the comparison, one or another
      pathology, normal state and dynamics of changes in the pathology
      of the object are diagnosed.<br>
      <br>
      The disadvantage of this method is that it allows only to diagnose
      the presence of pathology, without identifying the cause of the
      functional or organic change of the object under study, which
      makes it difficult to choose appropriate measures to restore the
      normal state of the object.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention is to create a simple and safe way to
      diagnose the pathology of an object, such as a person, which would
      allow not only to identify pathology, in particular chronic
      diseases, but also to determine the underlying causes that caused
      the functional state of the object to be impaired and, therefore,
      to restore its functionality.<br>
      <br>
      Ancient Oriental medicine regards the human body as a
      self-regulating system, an imbalance in which causes an anomaly of
      the condition or disease. The human body consists of seven
      interconnected and interpenetrating into each other bodies, which
      differ from each other in the range of vibrations (states of
      matter): the physical or material body, energy or etheric body and
      five subtle bodies. Each cell, tissue, organ, system of organs has
      seven layers (bodies) in space, and in each space, consisting of
      seven layers, a self-regulation system works that provides
      psychobiophysical homeostasis (constancy) of all seven types of
      energy (physical, etheric, astral and four mental). The system of
      self-regulation works normally if the psychobiophysical
      homeostasis does not differ from the natural level, equal to 100
      percent. Any deviation from this figure indicates a functional
      disorder of the studied organ (tissue, organ system, structure).
      Each cell, tissue, organ, organ system exchanges with each other
      and with the external environment energy, information, substance.<br>
      <br>
      The exchange takes place through appropriate channels, of which
      there are hundreds of thousands in the body. The exchange
      processes are guided by consciousness at seven levels
      (intranuclear, intracellular, cellular, tissue, organ, organ
      system, organism).<br>
      <br>
      All the underlying causes of the pathology of the body are of a
      wave nature, and they can be conventionally divided into negative
      external energy-information effects, negative internal information
      effects and negative effects of radiation from pathogenic
      pathogens. Very often the decisive factor in creating pathology of
      the body and severe disease states of unexplained etiology are
      negative external energy-information effects in the form of vortex
      structures of holographic solitons, which, like alien vibrations,
      penetrate the space of seven layers of organs (tissues, cells),
      creating connections with each other, and thus destroy the
      structure of the management of consciousness, the channels of
      energy, information, substance, and paralyze at all levels the
      work of self-regulation systems, causing steady cal disease that
      lasts a lifetime. The recording of these alien vibrations in a
      holographic form, together with an indication of the sources of
      these alien vibrations and the time stamp (when this recording was
      made and by whom) is stored in the archives of a person’s
      subconscious and can be extracted at any time using biolocation.<br>
      <br>
      The technical result of the present invention is to improve the
      efficiency of diagnostics by obtaining information from the human
      subconscious about the root causes of pathology, i.e., foreign
      vibrations penetrating into the human body and causing its
      pathology in the form of vortex structures of holographic
      solitons.<br>
      <br>
      Using the claimed diagnostic method allows the recovery of the
      self-regulation system of the human body using a vibration series,
      which is compiled using the information received and is actually
      an emitter having individually selected amplitude-frequency-phase
      characteristics neutralizing the identified vortex structure of
      the holographic soliton, while simultaneously with the soliton
      foreign vibrations associated with it are eliminated in the human
      body (the number of which can reach tens of thousands) without
      their additional analysis.<br>
      <br>
      This technical result is achieved by the fact that in a known
      method for diagnosing the pathology of an object in which the
      energy information image of the object being studied is formed,
      then the operator’s perceiving body is fixed at the starting point
      of the energy information image and its ponderomotive response is
      recorded by means of the energy indicator, when forming the energy
      information image elements negative external energy-information
      effects in the form of a vortex output structures of holographic
      solitons and their parameters, which are placed in a figure
      depicting a semicircle divided by radii into equal sectors, in
      each of which indicate the corresponding soliton or its parameter,
      while the center of the circle of the semicircle is the starting
      point of the image, or a bunch of hair, or a photograph of an
      object, and in the process of registering a ponderomotive
      reaction, the solitons affecting the object are determined, their
      number and the parameters from which they form a vibrational
      series.<br>
      <br>
      The method is as follows.<br>
      <br>
      Before the operator form the energy-information image of the
      object. Under the energy-informational image understand the means
      by which you can get information about the object under study. At
      the same time, the biological material of the object under study
      (or its photograph) and a previously compiled list of negative
      external energy-information effects in the form of vortex
      structures of holographic solitons and their parameters are used.
      Under external influences understand, for example, negative
      impacts from people around the object under study. The model of
      forms in the form of holographic solitons acting on the organism
      (stereoscopic standing wave) is considered in a well-known source
      of information (V. P. Kaznacheev. Probable paths of evolution of
      the intellectual form of living substance. Report at the World
      Congress of Spiritual Harmony, Almaty, October 1992, Herald of the
      Society of Friends of E. P. Blavatsky, vol. IV, M., 1993, p.
      59-64). <br>
      The shapes of the vortex structures of holographic solitons are
      very diverse and are determined empirically.<br>
      <br>
      The list of vortex structures and parameters is presented, for
      example, in the form of a known means, which is called a
      radiostetic diagram (described in the book L. Green "Mental
      Biolocation", Voronezh, NPO Modek, 1994, pp. 178 - 205 and in the
      book L Puchko "Biolocation for all. The system of self-diagnosis
      and self-healing person. (Scientific and practical guide) ", M.,
      Firm" SHARK ", 1996, fig. 70 - 97). The radiostetic diagram is a
      figure depicting a semicircle divided by radii into equal sectors,
      in each of which indicate the corresponding vortex structure of
      the holographic soliton, for example, in the form of a spiral,
      ball, pyramid, etc., or the corresponding parameter, for example,
      source and time negative impact. A finger, a photo, a patient's
      hair bundle are applied to the drawing with the specified image,
      and an energy-information connection is created immediately
      between the patient and the drawing. As indicated in the
      well-known source of information (book R. Gerber "Vibration
      medicine", translated from English, M., ed. KOR, 1997, p. 283,
      (original - 1988), where the means in the form of biological
      material of the object under study or its photograph have the term
      "vibrational witness", "in accordance with holographic theory,
      which explains that" any piece contains all the whole ", namely:
      any piece of the hologram contains all the information about the
      whole, i.e. vibrating witnesses contain specific information about
      the whole organism, while the vibrational witness has the same
      energy frequency as the object under study, between them observed
      his kind of energy resonance. " "The witness acts as a wave
      conductor, allowing the operator to tune in to the vibration
      frequency of the object under study" (p. 288, R. Gerber.
      "Vibration medicine"). "The photographs actually carry a certain
      element of the vibration substance of the object under study and,
      instead of tuning into a small representative hologram of the
      patient under study, encoded in blood or a bundle of hair, the
      doctor’s mind can tune into a space hologram to remotely obtain
      psychic information about the patient." (p.<br>
      289, R. Gerber. "Vibration medicine").<br>
      <br>
      The pendulum is used as an energy indicator, its popularity as a
      means by which the claimed method is implemented is confirmed by
      its description in L. Green’s “Mental Biolocation” (p. 149), which
      shows various forms of pendulums, as well as in L. Puchko
      "Biolocation for all" (Fig. 68), which shows the classical form of
      the pendulum. The perceiving body of the operator is his hand, in
      which the operator holds the pendulum. The operator fixes the arm
      with the pendulum at the starting point of the energy-information
      image, which is the center of the circle of the semicircle, and
      observes the movements of the pendulum, i.e. performs biolocation
      with his own look (with his own torsion fields). In the process of
      perception of the energy-informational image, the ponderomotive
      reaction of the operator’s perceiving organ is registered by
      monitoring the movements of the pendulum. In the well-known source
      of information (L. Green's book "Mental Biolocation", Voronezh,
      NPO Modek, 1994, p. 176), the above technique is called "graphic
      radioesthesia" and describes in detail the stages of its
      implementation.<br>
      <br>
      "In graphic radesthesia, the following should be considered: - the
      use of a wooden working plane for placing diagrams; - the
      orientation of the diagram with respect to the cardinal points.<br>
      <br>
      Stages of aesthetic research: - the establishment of a pendulum in
      the center of the base of the diagram; - giving the pendulum
      oscillations ("readiness"); - the focus of the operator on the
      task set in the diagram; - formation of a clear question for
      obtaining the requested information in accordance with a possible
      solution of the problem presented in the sector of the diagram; -
      expression of the result of the reflex movements-oscillations (the
      pendulum with its oscillations, like an arrow, selects one of the
      available sectors of the diagram corresponding to the desired
      alternative solution; readiness ") "In the direction of movement
      of the pendulum determine the desired sector with the appropriate
      vortex structure. Using the described technique, the remaining
      parameters of the vortex structures of holographic solitons are
      determined: the time of creation and the source of creation.<br>
      <br>
      Then, using the obtained results in the form of a vortex
      holographic structure, the time of its creation, the source of its
      creation and the indication of the number of vortex structures
      form a vibration series. Vibration series is a well-known means
      for the elimination of alien vibrations in the body (aura) of a
      person, regardless of the sources of their formation. For example,
      in a well-known source of information (L. Green’s book, Mental
      Biolocation, Voronezh, NPO Modek, 1994, p. 6), this well-known
      tool is called a “healing code” and notes that “the use of healing
      codes allows get rid of the influence of the field forms of the
      thin world "(field - wave), and on pages 210 - 237 lead various
      types of healing codes. In a well-known source of information
      (book by L. Puchko "Biolocation for all. The system of
      self-diagnosis and self-healing person. (Scientific and practical
      guide), M., Firm "SHARK", 1996 (chapter 5, pp. 95 - 98) described
      a similar tool, which in the book of L. Puchko has the term
      "vibration series", and describes in detail its compilation
      (formation).<br>
      <br>
      At the same time, on p. 95 of the indicated source, it is noted
      that the method of constructing numerical, geometric, and
      composite vibration series is the same for eliminating any
      disharmonious vibrations.<br>
      <br>
      Example. Patient S. (62 g) felt a sudden sharp deterioration in
      her health. Earlier, she had an official diagnosis: hypertension,
      vascular dystonia, renal failure, venous insufficiency,
      arrhythmia. Receiving appropriate medication did not change the
      patient's condition. The patient was placed in the hospital, but
      the treatment did not improve the patient's condition. Then the
      patient was diagnosed using the inventive method, and the
      underlying causes of her pathology were identified in the form of
      vortex structures of holographic solitons, namely: vortex
      structures in the form of a lump of energetic dirt, two studs and
      a helix. The sources and dates of formation of the identified
      structures were identified. Vibration series, compiled using the
      information received, significantly improved the patient's
      condition. <br>

      <br>
      SUBSTANCE: method includes performance of preliminary diagnostics
      of meridians by operator by means of biolocation methods for
      determination of energetic blocks. Diagnostics is performed by
      exposure of patient to sound, light, heat, and odor with
      simultaneous carrying out of physical exercises by using
      cylindrical spring. To this end, spring is first positioned on
      cervical section of vertebral column, and patient moves it along
      vertebral column, and then it is clamped in region of large-sized
      joints of upper and lower limbs, and patient stains muscles of
      limbs with subsequent change of position of joint surfaces.
      Physical exercises are performed in synchronism with respiration,
      and exposure to sound is performed at frequency and rhythm of
      systoles. In process of correction operator performs additional
      diagnostics repeatedly with aid of biolocation method for chancing
      the exposure parameters and selecting the spring characteristics.
      He renders bioenergetic effect till energetic blocks are
      eliminated. Biolocation diagnostics of patient is performed by
      main energetic meridians and centers. Energetic blocks and
      external energetic ties are eliminated due to action of external
      bioenergetic field and resonant effect of external field on
      patient. Oscillatory external effect is produced by means of
      external mechanical generator along with external electromagnetic
      effect. EFFECT: enhanced efficiency of bioenergetic correction. <br>
      <br>
      The invention relates to medicine and can be used for the
      prevention of diseases of the musculoskeletal system, internal
      organs, increase efficiency and improve the immune system without
      the use of drugs, as well as eliminate the consequences of
      external biopathogenic energy effects. The method can be used to
      restore normal metabolism and eliminate the actions of geopathic
      influences and aggressive actions of the environment.<br>
      <br>
      The method according to the present invention is intended both for
      sick people, and for patients at the stage of recovery and
      rehabilitation, after a long stay on bed rest. In addition, this
      method is intended for healthy people with a sedentary lifestyle,
      boys and girls in the making, for individuals of certain
      professions (athletes, models, mannequins, artists, scientists,
      etc.). The method is also intended for the recovery of people
      exposed to geopathic and biopathogenic influences.<br>
      <br>
      Known methods of preventing diseases and healing the human body
      are based on the creation of conditions conducive to isolating a
      patient from the influence of external disturbances and creating
      an impact with sound, heat, light signals, a bioenergetic field.<br>
      <br>
      In some well-known methods, ionization of the environment is
      sometimes added as an active factor, the patient is additionally
      affected by an odor generator, air currents, while using
      biogenerators of various designs that concentrate the energy of
      Cosmos, biofields of the environment and people.<br>
      <br>
      There is a method of treating diseases consisting in a
      bioenergetic effect on a person with a frequency of 3–5 MHz at a
      distance of 1–2 m and redistribution of energy in the body through
      exposure by studying with a hand pass with a frequency of 1–3 MHz
      at a distance of 30–100 cm (see RF patent 2030186, from 1994).<br>
      <br>
      Basically, the known methods provide the task of relaxation of the
      patient, the therapeutic effect is insignificant and short-term.
      The closest analogue of the bioenergetic method of preventing
      diseases and healing the body according to this invention is the
      method according to which the patient is affected by heat, sound,
      light and bioenergetic field, and they perform a set of exercises
      with the formation of a motivational component in the process
      performed (V.I. Dontsov, Bioenergy Human Encyclopedia, In-Folio,
      Moscow, 1994, p. 92 - 132).<br>
      <br>
      The disadvantages of this method include: low therapeutic effect,
      which has a short-term effect and the prevalence of the relaxation
      component, the lack of complexity of the impact due to lack of
      understanding of the mechanism of action of various factors and
      their relationships, the lack of funds that set the parameters of
      external mechanical effects, the inability to eliminate the
      negative effects of external energy channels (bindings).<br>
      <br>
      It is known that there is a category of persons with the ability
      to influence the information field of other people and objects,
      which is unaware of these abilities. In addition to this category,
      there are persons who consciously act on information and energy
      fields. Both groups have a pronounced ability to create bioenergy
      links with the fields and energy channels of objects, and with
      equal probability such links can be both negative and positive.
      Fixing informational links between these categories of people and
      objects of impact, there are permanent channels for transferring
      energetic influences - bindings that can equally likely combine
      both the fields of biological objects (people) and the field of a
      biological object with a meaningful object of the inanimate world
      or emotional coloration of the situation.<br>
      <br>
      The bioenergetic method of correcting a person’s condition in
      accordance with the present invention eliminates these drawbacks
      due to the fact that it consists in the operator conducting
      preliminary diagnostics of meridians using biolocation methods for
      determining energy blocks, exposing the patient to sound, light,
      heat and smell while performing physical exercises a cylindrical
      spring spring, for which the spring is first placed on the
      cervical spine and the patient moves it in length of the spine,
      then the spring is clamped in the area of the large joints of the
      upper and lower extremities and the patient strains the muscles of
      the extremities with the subsequent change in the position of the
      articular surfaces, while physical exercises are performed
      simultaneously with breathing, the sound is performed with the
      frequency and rhythm of heart contractions, and in the process of
      correction the operator repeatedly conducts additional diagnostics
      using biolocation methods to change the parameters of the effects
      carried out and to select the characteristics of the spring and
      the wasp There is a bioenergy effect before the elimination of
      energy blocks.<br>
      <br>
      The essence of the method according to this invention is as
      follows.<br>
      <br>
      The effect achieved with the use of resonance-wave effects is
      based on the fact that human organs and tissues have a
      heterogeneous density, and therefore, respond differently to the
      resonance-frequency characteristics of the effects. This
      circumstance creates conditions for strictly selective influence
      on any tissue and any organ not only as a whole, but also on its
      structural and functional elements and formations.<br>
      <br>
      The reflected wave of bioenergy allows you to continuously perform
      biolocation diagnostics during the correction of the bioenergy
      state of the body according to the presented method. Resonant-wave
      interaction in this method generates cerebrospinal fluid and
      hemodynamic waves, which provide a reconstruction of the dynamics
      of brain fluids, simultaneously stimulating the restoration of
      orientation of disorganized cellular structures and the proper
      flow of energy processes in all systems and structural links of
      the body as a whole and the musculoskeletal system particular. The
      most convincing evidence of the effectiveness of the method used
      is a reduction in muscle hypertonia and a significant improvement
      in peripheral functions occurring during this kind of exposure.<br>
      <br>
      Consider the mechanism of action according to the present method
      in more detail. Sound, light, thermal, bioenergetic effects and
      smell, manipulative effects by specifying the spatial movements of
      individual parts of the spine and other segments of the patient's
      musculoskeletal system, as well as vibrational and electromagnetic
      effects from an external mechanical generator generate a
      mechanical vibration wave in the conductive medium of the body.
      Dynamic change of impact parameters due to external mechanical
      generator and a certain position of individual parts of the
      musculoskeletal system set the parameters of this wave, such as
      amplitude and intensity, direction of propagation and frequency
      characteristics. Interorgan and intraorgan cavities and
      interstitial capillary slots make it possible to form a
      vibrational wave of a very complex configuration, capable of
      penetrating into any given part of the body or organ. Having
      reached the target, the wave causes a local microexplosion in this
      area, destroying adhesions, cleaving and splitting tissue,
      breaking up the formed salts, eliminating blocks, traffic jams,
      energy clamps, etc.<br>
      <br>
      This ensures the succession from the procedure to the procedure of
      structuring and restoring the affected tissue and replenishing the
      energy of an organ or body area. Along with the destruction and
      elimination of pathological changes in the tissues, a parallel
      restoration of their functional physical and energy properties
      occurs.<br>
      <br>
      When performing bio-energetic exercises according to the present
      method, an automatic massage of the body’s acupuncture points
      takes place, the effect on which increases the tone and improves
      the immune system of the whole organism, the position of the
      vertebrae and intervertebral disks improves.<br>
      <br>
      The first and main objective of this method is to eliminate the
      causes that prevent energy from freely and evenly circulating in
      the body. These factors include any factors that prevent a person
      from improving his energy state (salt deposits, displacement and
      deformation of the vertebrae and intervertebral discs, fear and
      other negative emotions). Taking into account the modern
      understanding of energy perception and distribution of
      electromagnetic energy in the meridians of the human body, the
      present method allows to eliminate the following causes of
      diseases: to make a separation of energy bindings and
      biopathogenic connections at the level of the human aura field and
      main energy meridians, to eliminate the energy clip - closing the
      energy channel or meridian, remove the physical block - muscle
      paralysis, salt deposits, the formation of stones, sand, etc.,
      remove energy bindings of the main channels and human meridians
      associated with biopathogenic and geopathic effects, remove nerve
      blocks - depletion of the nervous system, overstrain, eliminate
      psychological block - stress, emotional breakdown, depressive
      state.<br>
      <br>
      Elimination of nervous and mental blocks and the separation of
      external energy bindings from the main meridians and the auric
      field of a person ensures the restoration of dangling energy
      feedbacks and the integrity of the patient's information field.<br>
      <br>
      Breakage of feedback and the formation of energy binding occurs
      under the influence of previously obtained negative energies.
      Energy jams form blocks that, together with the bindings, cause
      dysfunction of specific organs and further negatively affect the
      dynamics of the general state of the body.<br>
      <br>
      The formed blocks and energy bindings of geopathic and
      biopathogenic effects do not allow energy to circulate correctly
      and evenly throughout the body and receive it from the outside
      from any existing sources of additional energy (music, color,
      plants, animals, etc.). Most effectively this method eliminates
      the blocks and energy bindings associated with common diseases
      such as sciatica, osteochondrosis, nervous diseases, diseases of
      the immune system and disruption of the body’s energy system due
      to external pathogenic influences of information and energy.<br>
      <br>
      One of the main achievements of this method is that each exercise
      involves the maximum number of muscles and structures of the
      energy field; therefore, harmful substances, metabolic products
      and negative energy have no place to linger and they are actively
      eliminated from the body and the patient's auric field.<br>
      <br>
      The second advantage of this method according to this invention is
      the purification of the energy channels of thin bodies and
      structures, which subsequently leads to the purification of the
      body and its healing. This is achieved due to the impact of an
      external mechanical generator and an external bioenergy field
      generator.<br>
      Slagging and clogging of the energy channels of the body occurs
      daily under the influence of food consumed, thoughts, feelings and
      emotions in relation to the situations that arise and people
      entering into verbal and energy contact. If such effects are
      negative, then at the level of physico-chemical reactions in the
      body, toxic substances are formed that contaminate the body at the
      cellular level. Negative energy effects affect the auric field of
      a person and the main channels and meridians of the flow of
      energy, which leads to the formation of energy bindings between
      the patient and objects of the outside world, the appearance of
      traffic jams and blocks in the way of the normally flowing energy
      in the human body.<br>
      <br>
      A set of exercises, together with other influences used in this
      method, allow you to actively remove toxins from the body and
      replace the polluted energy with clean. In addition, the work
      includes previously inactive or blocked energy centers. The
      organism begins not to consume energy, but to radiate it outside.
      There is an internal harmonization of the organism and a person
      begins to positively influence the world around.<br>
      <br>
      The third advantage of the method according to the invention is
      the achievement of an even distribution of energy throughout the
      body. To do this, many exercises use a smooth and plastic movement
      using a cylindrical spring, which distributes energy in the human
      body and effects from external generators. The elimination of
      energy bindings associated with the negative effects of geopathic
      zones and the environment, including humans, also leads to an even
      distribution of energy in the human aura and eliminates the
      channel of energy leakage from the auric field.<br>
      <br>
      The basis of the method includes physical exercise, cleansing the
      spine and almost all the major muscle groups: back, chest,
      abdomen, neck, muscles of the upper and lower extremities. As a
      result of the complete elaboration of the complex, the blood
      circulation and energy of the body are improved. In the active
      work involved almost the entire skeleton and all joints, all parts
      of the spinal column. Physical exercises in combination with
      respiratory gymnastics, psychoconcentration, exposure to an
      external mechanical generator and a bioenergetic field generator
      normalize the process of excitation and inhibition in the cerebral
      cortex, thereby providing a therapeutic and health effect on the
      human body as a whole. Performing exercises without mental
      concentration and without synchronization with the parameters of
      breathing and the effects of external generators does not have the
      desired effect on the body.<br>
      <br>
      Synchronization with the parameters of respiration and exposure to
      external generators helps to improve muscle tone, vascular
      function, normalize the activity of the nervous system, reducing
      cholesterol in the blood, removes negative energy from the body
      and feeds it with positive energy. An important role in the
      implementation of the proposed method is played by the pauses of
      the respiratory cycle, during which, by setting certain spatial
      movements and combining tension and relaxation of individual
      muscle groups, the body is saturated with energy and partial
      elimination of bindings.<br>
      <br>
      In addition to the above effects, a significant role in removing
      negative energy factors and bringing the body into a normal energy
      state is played by the color gamut, which affects the patient
      during a health session in this way.<br>
      <br>
      The muscular system is positively affected by red, the circulatory
      - green, the respiratory tract corresponds to blue, the skeletal
      system - blue, orange affects the sexual sphere and the urogenital
      system, yellow - the nervous system, purple - to the endocrine
      glands.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 1 shows a block diagram of the patient's exposure to the
      patient according to the present method for correcting a person’s
      bioenergy state; FIG. 2 shows the effects of an external
      mechanical generator on the body; FIG. 3 - the appearance of a
      mechanical generator. FIG. 4 shows the types of vibrations
      generated by an external mechanical generator.<br>
      <br>
      Consider the mechanism of action of the bioenergetic method of
      prevention and healing of the human body according to this
      invention.<br>
      <br>
      According to the present method, the patient is influenced by a
      resonant-wave action by setting the spatial movements of
      individual segments of the spine and other parts of the
      musculoskeletal system. The patient is simultaneously affected by
      an oscillating and electromagnetic field from an external
      mechanical generator, made in the form of a cylindrical spring.
      The length of the cylindrical spring is 20–60 cm, the diameter is
      5–30 cm, the diameter of the coil is 2–10 mm, the number of turns
      is 5–20. The cylindrical spring can be made of any metal, for
      example steel, copper. The external mechanical generator together
      with the patient forms a complex oscillatory system. When
      performing spatial movements, a cylindrical spring makes micro
      oscillations that, through certain joints, enter the entire
      musculoskeletal system and its individual segments. FIG. 4 shows
      the graphs of the types of oscillations created by an external
      mechanical generator. These oscillations consist of low-frequency
      oscillations, high-frequency and superimposed high-frequency
      oscillations.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, it will be possible to achieve a resonant-wave effect on the
      human body and individual segments of the patient's
      musculoskeletal system under the action of other external
      disturbances. By selecting and setting the mode of effects due to
      the resonant wave action, it is possible to eliminate obstacles in
      the form of disturbances and blocks in the human body that
      interfere with the normal and correct distribution of energy in
      the meridians.<br>
      <br>
      The set of exercises is set in such a way that the influence from
      them and the effect of an external mechanical generator are in
      resonance. In addition to the oscillatory effect, an external
      mechanical generator exerts an electromagnetic effect on the
      patient's body due to the concentration of electromagnetic study
      of the environment, including the energy of the Cosmos. Moreover,
      this electromagnetic effect on the patient is superimposed on the
      rhythmic effect of the complex of exercises and the influence of
      well-defined external fluctuations in the form of color, heat,
      sound, and smell effects. These effects produce the main
      mechanical wave in the conducting media of the body, providing a
      healing effect. <br>
      The parameters of the external generator are selected in such a
      way that due to its elastic properties oscillatory motions of
      various frequencies and amplitudes can be formed.<br>
      <br>
      The method is applied as follows.<br>
      <br>
      At the beginning, the patient is diagnosed using biolocation with
      the use of a framework of conventional construction along the main
      bioenergy meridians, while fixing the places of formation of
      energy jams, blocks and breaks of energy bonds, as well as the
      places of formation of energy bindings.<br>
      <br>
      After that, the patient's cervical spine is located on an external
      mechanical generator, made in the form of a cylindrical spring.
      Set the movement of the generator along the longitudinal axis of
      the patient. Then a cylindrical spring spring is clamped in the
      area of large joints of the upper and lower extremities. During
      friction of the spring against the skin, massage of periarticular
      tissues is performed, for example, at the level of the spinal
      column. By straining certain muscle groups, the patient presses
      the cylindrical spring against the body, thereby immersing the
      acting elements deep into the soft tissues and carrying out their
      stimulation and correction of the joints surrounding them. When
      this occurs, the spasmodic muscles and ligaments relax, the blood
      vessels dilate, the conductivity of the nerve fibers and the
      energy of the surrounding tissues increase. Cyclically repeating
      the movements described above, the patient rhythmically massages
      the periarticular tissues, alternating massage with correction of
      the position of the articular surfaces. <br>
      <br>
      At the same time, in the present method, traditional types of wave
      action are preserved - sound, light, heat, and smell.<br>
      <br>
      Since the spine is the energy basis of our body, the main
      parameters of the resonant-wave action are given by a set of
      exercises using a cylindrical spring. At the same time,
      oscillations come in simultaneously from an external mechanical
      generator, the frequency and amplitude of which also depends on
      the complex of exercises used and the internal frequency and
      amplitude of resonance of the metal itself. In the process of
      doing exercises, one achieves synchronization of movements with
      breathing parameters. Such synchronization (duration, depth of
      breathing, rhythm, etc.) makes it possible to create the most
      suitable conditions for the occurrence of resonant-wave processes
      in the patient's body in general and the cardiovascular system in
      particular. Simultaneously with the resonant-wave effect on the
      patient's body, electromagnetic influences come from an external
      mechanical generator due to the accumulation of electromagnetic
      fields of the external environment, including the energy of
      Cosmos.<br>
      <br>
      Unlike stimuli, for the perception of which there are specialized
      receptors, alternating magnetic fields, possessing a large
      penetrating effect, can simultaneously affect various tissues of
      the body. However, due to the different sensitivity of tissues and
      organs, as well as due to the inclusion of reparative processes,
      the overall reaction of the body varies at different stages of
      exposure. But at all stages the central nervous system takes part
      in it as the main regulator of the central link in the body’s
      response chain.<br>
      <br>
      The electromagnetic field, causing a variety of sensations,
      changing the electrical activity of the brain (especially the
      hypothalamus and cortex), affects the formation of skills,
      information storage and reproduction, changes the
      emotional-volitional sphere, disrupts the functions of cerebral
      apparatus, vascular regulation, changes hematological and
      biochemical parameters. Therefore, it is necessary to optimize the
      electromagnetic characteristics of the environment with parameters
      that meet the needs of the organism when performing a particular
      activity, i.e. requires a kind of electromagnetic comfort.<br>
      <br>
      According to the present method, the patient is exposed to a weak
      irritant of a bioenergetic nature, the intensity of which ranges
      from 10-12 to 10-15 W / cm2. For this purpose, an external
      bioenergy field generator is provided, which is in the same
      environmental conditions as the patient. Impact parameters that
      come from an external bioenergy generator are modified to ensure
      resonance with all other influences.<br>
      <br>
      The bioenergy effect allows to eliminate those blocks and energy
      bindings that cannot be eliminated by other types of effects. In
      the process of implementing the method, biolocation is carried out
      along the main energy channels to the meridians and change the
      parameters of the external bioenergy field generator, its
      frequency and amplitude until it is fixed using the biolocation of
      the separation of energy bindings and the elimination of blocks in
      different parts of the body and the auric field of the patient.<br>
      <br>
      A computer can be used as a decision-making unit controlling the
      setting of the operating modes of the generator of effects. In its
      absence, this function can be performed by the operator. As a
      source, forming a light, heat, sound effects and smell, use widely
      used generators, for example, the same as in the specified analog.
      The mechanism of their impact on the patient's body is similar.<br>
      <br>
      The impact of the sound is selected according to the frequency and
      rhythm of the heartbeats involved, with the result that everyone
      can do the exercises in their own rhythm. When the vibrations of a
      person and the rhythm of music coincide, a resonance occurs, at
      which energy is summed up and an optimal selection of rhythmic
      action takes place. The use of various musical directions and
      genres, as well as sounds of a ritual nature - the ringing of a
      bell, tambourine, tam-tam, etc. allows you to optimally select the
      frequency resonance corresponding to the organisms of different
      age groups involved. Here, music plays the role of an additional
      source of directing energy. Under the influence of such a resonant
      influence, energy is fed to the internal organs, restructuring of
      the nervous system and psychological perception of a person.<br>
      <br>
      The main effect that determines the rhythmic and wave effects on
      the body is a set of physical exercises using an external
      mechanical generator and the effects of an external bioenergy
      generator, whose influence depends on the type of disturbances in
      the human body and the localization of blocks and energy bindings
      in the patient's information and energy field.<br>
      <br>
      The preventive effect and recovery of the body in this way is
      provided by the participation of all biochemical and mental
      processes, namely memory, sensations, perception, attention,
      representation, imagination, thinking and emotions. And although
      these aspects of human activity are manifested only in their
      totality, the optimal conditions for the course of the processes
      of prevention and recovery of the organism as a whole depend on
      the specific conditions of the course and the formation of each of
      these processes. <br>
      However, the determining influence on the formation and treatment
      of these processes has a rhythm, because the rhythm is integral to
      the person, who is the conductor of rhythmic manifestations in all
      spheres of biological, mental and social life and
      self-synchronization of oscillating systems and organs.<br>
      <br>
      Hence, the rhythm must be considered as the material basis of the
      two components of human activity - knowledge and actions with
      indirect effects on respiration, blood circulation and internal
      secretion, which in turn creates a field for the activity of
      emotions, as well as stimulates, supports and enriches
      associations, causing feelings of pleasant regularity and general
      stabilization.<br>
      <br>
      Since periodicity and rhythm are a characteristic feature of all
      mental processes, when solving problems of optimizing the
      prevention and healing of the body, there is a need to
      purposefully change this periodicity, i.e. in managing it. The
      sound rhythm of musical works and various rhythmically composed
      phrases and phrases (plots, prayers) perceived by a sound analyzer
      has a strong and direct influence on the processes of formation
      and organization of the rhythmic characteristics of the body,
      including allowing you to reprogram individual pathological
      rhythms and bring them to healthy rhythmic manifestations .<br>
      <br>
      The visual rhythm perceived visually, has a linear embodiment in
      space and on the plane in the form of a uniform alternation of
      certain forms, their interrelations, in various optical phenomena.
      Linear rhythm is embodied in the schedule. This method involves
      the use of character-graphic constructions for the selection and
      inclusion of certain visual rhythmic orientations.<br>
      <br>
      The sense of touch specifies the impression of rhythm and acts on
      the perception stronger than the rhythm perceived by the auditory
      or visual analyzers. Touch is an activating factor in the
      perception of rhythm and a method of its direct transfer to a
      person. In the application of the method according to the present
      invention, the tactile construction of a rhythmic impact is
      carried out using a cylindrical spring, which in its structure
      carries the tactile rhythm laid down with the number of turns,
      their frequency and diameter.<br>
      These examples clearly show that the synchronizing factors of
      biological processes can be light, temperature, electromagnetic
      and bioenergetic fields, music, poetry, the influence of external
      mechanical generators, the rhythm of a graphic image, etc.<br>
      <br>
      It can be said that studies indicate the fact of a natural
      restructuring of biopotentials, as a result of which, when all
      these rhythm-forming factors are applied, a definite rhythm of the
      central nervous system and the brain, adjusted for recovery, is
      established. The combination of exercise complex, visual,
      auditory, odor factors and the influence of electromagnetic and
      bioenergy fields, along with the restoration of the state of the
      energy body, can be likened to the presentation of a positive
      potential of great strength, as a result of which processes in
      different parts of the cortex begin to occur similarly, that is,
      the combination of synchronized effects leads to action is a
      mechanism that, in turn, synchronizes the rhythmic activity of the
      cortex, and only olozhitelny signal.<br>
      <br>
      All of the above suggests that the need and effectiveness of the
      use of a complex of synchronizing effects in organizing the
      prevention of diseases and recovery of the body is currently
      beyond doubt.<br>
      <br>
      The above considered the mechanism of action of individual
      influences. The high efficiency of the method for correcting the
      bioenergy state of a person according to this invention is
      achieved by observing the well-known general principles of system
      interaction: the principle of resonance, the principle of
      self-synchronization of oscillating systems.<br>
      <br>
      At present, the mechanisms of action of individual disturbances
      are sufficiently substantiated. However, the use of complex
      effects and the management of these effects are not sufficiently
      effective. Therefore, the proposed method is new in comparison
      with previously known. The high efficiency of the method is
      achieved through the following actions characterizing the method
      as an invention: a set of exercises has been developed,
      corresponding to specific diseases and bioenergetic disorders,
      which sets spatial movement to certain segments of the
      musculoskeletal system using a coil spring, combined with rhythmic
      and wave effects of sound, light, heat, electromagnetic and
      bioenergetic effects cause a healing resonant effect on the body
      man and individual organs and tissues as a whole, an optimal
      system has been developed for eliminating external energy effects
      on the human biofield by eliminating blocks in the energy
      meridians and breaking the pathological energy bindings of a
      person to certain biopathogenic and geopathogenic objects;
      performance of movements is brought to automatism, in order to
      achieve a steady resonance-wave action, which e by focusing on the
      patient's thoughts painful organ or body part enters into said
      part of the body, causing curative and prophylactic effect.<br>
      <br>
      As a result of the application of the invention: the physical body
      of a person, his organs and systems is healed, the energy
      meridians are cleared from the blocks, leading to the correct flow
      of energy processes and the interaction of organs and tissues, the
      human energy field is released from external energy bindings,
      which allows to direct the released energy to recovery of the body
      and the optimization of the brain, by applying an external
      mechanical generator, optimization of the muscular apparatus and
      joints, eliminates external pathogenic effects on the human body,
      its energy field and physical body by reprogramming the rhythmic
      characteristics of the cerebral cortex and autonomic nervous
      system to achieve a positive coherent perception and assessment of
      the surrounding reality.<br>
      <br>
      The use of the described method of preventing diseases and healing
      the body allows, after the first session, to increase the mobility
      of the skeleton, to feel the positive effects of reprogramming the
      rhythm of perception of the situation, to bring the body into a
      state of heightened tone and rapid self-healing.<br>

      </div>
      Inventor: SMIRNOVA N M<br>
      <br>
      SUBSTANCE: method consists in the fact that before the
      construction of building on the country determined are the
      direction of the geographic poles, magnitude and direction of the
      earth's magnetic field, location of geopathogenic zones, blocking
      of the geopathogenic zones is accomplished in the place of the
      supposed construction, selected are the place for building
      construction, its location, arrangement of partitions inside the
      building, building and finishing materials, items of interior and
      furniture with due account for psychophysiologic state of people,
      who will live or work in the building. The psychophysiologic state
      of people is determined due to finding of the integral index of
      intensity by measuring the respiration rate, pulse rate and
      indices of cutaneogalvanic reaction with the aid of the methods of
      biolocation, analysis of birth gyroscopes. At construction
      selected are the relation of the geometric dimensions of the
      building, story jobs are carried out with due account for the
      lunar month, and on completion of construction the purpose of the
      rooms is determined with the aid of the methods of biolocation. On
      the territory adjacent to the building the effect of the
      geopathogenic zones is blocked by implantation in their center of
      trees of the species accumulating the natural energy, or by
      covering of their location by mineral energy concentrators, for
      example, granite crushed rock or white sand with a pad thickness
      up to 0.8 m, and on the adjacent territory arranged are plants and
      landscape object accumulating the cosmic energy and providing for
      weakening of negative effects of the geomagnetic field on the
      building and space around it. EFFECT: enhanced safety. <br>
      <br>
      The present invention relates to bioenergy and medicine and can be
      used to ensure a bioenergy ecology inside a building and in the
      area adjacent to the structure from energy and psychophysiological
      points of view. The invention can be used both in the construction
      of a new building and in the reconstruction of an old one, in
      order to protect living people from the action of negative energy
      fields of various origins, including negative fields of biological
      objects.<br>
      <br>
      There are ways to ensure bioenergy ecology, which consists in the
      detection of geopathic zones of the Earth’s magnetic field, in
      blocking the effects of these zones by using protective screens
      made of metals (aluminum, copper), of minerals and using indoor
      generators that create counter-electromagnetic fields (see USSR
      Author's Certificate 1311740, A 61 N 1/16).<br>
      <br>
      However, the known methods have the following disadvantages: they
      are not intended for use on large spaces of residential premises,
      as they allow to provide the necessary protective level only in
      limited volumes; they are intended for medical use only and are
      used in medical and research institutions; are expensive, which
      makes it difficult to use them on a large scale in individual
      residential and industrial construction; do not eliminate the
      harmful effects of certain energy fields, especially those acting
      on the psycho-physiological state of a person; have low efficiency
      associated with the short duration of a person in a shielded room;
      characterized by a limited time to achieve a protective healing
      effect, which is associated with the impossibility of a person's
      permanent stay in the created conditions of the protective
      environment; They do not consider the possibility of ensuring
      bioenergy ecology by creating a protective aura field of plants
      and animals inside the building and in the adjacent territory.<br>
      <br>
      The disadvantages of the known methods also include the
      impossibility of ensuring the following tasks of bioenergy
      ecology: to plan the most advantageous energy location of the
      structure for living and working people; plan the most
      advantageous internal structure and architecture of the structure,
      depending on its location, function and nature of the people
      living or working in it; to plan the structure in the most
      advantageous energy way to best ensure the fulfillment of its
      functions laid during construction; select a time that is
      favorable for the start of construction, which ensures further
      energy security of the house or building and its durability; to
      choose a favorable time for the start of construction and repair
      of the premises, which lays down favorable biorhythms for a person
      or a group of people living in the house; select energy-safe
      materials for the construction, repair and finishing of finished
      housing, buildings, apartments; choose the best combination of
      materials during the construction and interior decoration of the
      house to ensure in-house psycho-physiological comfort, energy
      security from the negative impact of the surrounding world;
      eliminate the influence of geopathic zones on the plot; use the
      methods of cosmobiology to create comfort and safe living
      conditions and life of a person; energetically competent to
      distribute the purpose of the premises inside the house and
      outbuildings; to select for a particular person energetically
      energizing and revealing his aura: a tree, a plant, a stone, an
      animal or another energetically significant object; to select an
      interior structure that is energetically and psychophysiologically
      favorable for the owners; to choose the most favorable from a
      psychophysiological, energy and medical point of view, the color
      scheme and decoration of the premises; restore the energy
      integrity of the finished premises; restore the lost natural
      energy abilities of minerals, natural and finishing materials of
      the finished structure; use incense and aromatherapy to restore
      aura-friendly room for life and rest; use color therapy to prevent
      chronic fatigue syndrome and restore the energy integrity of the
      human body; choose comfortable time rhythms for each individual;
      to increase the energy compatibility of various types of trees and
      plants in the household plot; Protect the home from the influence
      of negative energy; pick up materials and methods to restore the
      positive energy of the already existing premises (including
      apartments) for major repairs; block possible negative energy
      flows in the finished housing or apartment in the process of
      repair.<br>
      <br>
      This invention eliminates these drawbacks due to the fact that the
      method of ensuring the bioenergy ecology of a building is
      characterized in that before building a building on the ground,
      the direction of geographic poles, the magnitude and direction of
      the Earth’s magnetic field, the location of geopathic zones, block
      geopathic zones at the site of the proposed construction choose a
      place for the construction of the building and its location,
      placement of partitions inside the building, construction and
      finishing materials, s interior and furniture, taking into account
      the psycho-physiological state of the people who will live or work
      in the building; The psychophysiological state of people is
      determined by finding the integral index of tension by measuring
      the respiratory rate, pulse rate and indicators of galvanic skin
      response; the psychophysiological state of people is determined
      using biolocation techniques; The psycho-physiological state of
      people is determined by analyzing the birth horoscope; choose the
      ratio of the geometric dimensions of the building, its length to
      width, based on ratios from 2: 3 to 10:10 meters; floor work
      carried out taking into account the period of the lunar month;
      upon completion of construction with the help of biolocation
      techniques determine the intended use of the premises; on the
      territory adjacent to the building, they block the action of
      geopathic zones by planting tree species in their center, which
      accumulate natural energy, or backfill their location with mineral
      energy concentrators, such as granite rubble or white sand with a
      pillow thickness up to 0.8 meters; On the adjacent territory,
      plants and landscape objects are placed, which accumulate cosmic
      energy and ensure the weakening of the negative effects of the
      geomagnetic field on the building and the space around it.<br>
      <br>
      The main objective of this method is to eliminate the causes that
      do not allow energy to freely and evenly circulate in the human
      body. These factors include any factors that impede the normal
      flow of energy flows (salt deposits, fear, negative emotions,
      weakening of the immune system, etc.) and causing the breakdown of
      reverse energy bonds. <br>
      <br>
      Breakage of reverse energy bonds also occurs under the influence
      of previously obtained natural background and artificially induced
      negative energy varieties. Energy jams cause a violation of the
      functions of specific organs and further negatively affect the
      state of the body as a whole, not allowing energy to circulate
      evenly throughout the body and the body itself - to receive energy
      from additional sources. Taking into account the modern
      understanding of the distribution of electromagnetic and
      biological energy in the human body, this method eliminates the
      following causes of diseases and deterioration of the
      psycho-emotional background (remove the "blocks" in the body):
      energy - overlapping channel (meridian) of flowing energy,
      physical block - muscle paralysis or contracture, salt deposition,
      the formation of stones, sand and other diseases associated with
      slagging of the body, mental block - stress factor, emotional
      breakdown, depressive state s, nerve block - depletion nervous
      system in general, fatigue, insomnia and the like condition<br>
      Elimination of nervous and mental blocks provides restoration of
      dangling energy feedbacks. Most effectively, this method
      eliminates the blockage associated with nervous stress, overwork
      of the nervous system, chronic fatigue syndrome, psychosomatic
      diseases of internal organs.<br>
      <br>
      The second advantage of this method according to this invention is
      the purification of the energy channels of thin bodies and
      structures, which leads to a complex cleansing effect on the
      body's energy and subsequently to the improvement of the human
      body both at the level of subtle components and at the level of
      the physical body.<br>
      <br>
      Under the action of high-frequency components of the Earth’s
      magnetic field, cosmic radiation, and geopathic zones, at the
      level of physicochemical reactions, toxic substances are formed in
      the body, spreading throughout the body and contaminating it at
      the cellular and energy levels. Performing a sequence of actions
      for this method allows you to actively remove toxins from the body
      and replace contaminated energy with clean. In addition,
      non-functioning or previously blocked energy centers are included
      in the work. The organism begins not to consume energy, but to
      radiate it outside. There is an internal harmonization of the
      organism and a person begins to positively influence the world
      around.<br>
      The third advantage of the method according to the invention is
      the achievement of an even distribution of energy throughout the
      body.<br>
      <br>
      Electromagnetic fields have the following biotropic indicators:
      intensity, gradient, vector, frequency, pulse shape, localization.
      Analysis of the impact of the electromagnetic field should be
      divided into the analysis of the effects of magnetic and
      electrical components. Heterogeneous electromagnetic fields have a
      more pronounced biological effect than homogeneous, and the
      vertical direction of the lines of force acts more efficiently
      than the horizontal. Variable magnetic fields cause nonspecific
      reactions that are detected both at the level of the organism as a
      whole, and at the level of the central nervous system and cellular
      nerve formations in particular. Unlike stimuli, for the perception
      of which there are specialized receptors, alternating magnetic
      fields, possessing a large penetrating effect, can simultaneously
      affect various tissues of the body. However, due to the different
      sensitivity of tissues and organs, as well as due to the inclusion
      of repair processes, the general reaction of the body changes at
      different stages of exposure.<br>
      <br>
      But at all stages the central nervous system takes an active part
      in it as the central regulating organ of the main link in the
      chain of responses. Considering localizing effects, for example,
      on the brain, it can be noted that, in addition to nerve cells,
      glial elements are included in the response to electromagnetic
      fields, the participation of which causes the appearance of slow
      fluctuations in the electrical activity of the brain. It is
      characteristic that such changes occur with a large latent period,
      continue for a long time after the end of exposure and are often
      accompanied by a predominance of the inhibitory process in the
      central nervous system.<br>
      <br>
      The electromagnetic field changes the electrical activity of the
      brain, especially the hypothalamus and cortex, affects the
      processes of skill formation, information storage processes in
      brain structures and its reproduction, changes in the
      emotional-volitional sphere, impaired function of cerebral
      apparatus, causes reconstructive-connective dysfunctions, changes
      hematological and biochemical indicators. Therefore, it is
      necessary to optimize the electromagnetic characteristics of the
      environment with the parameters corresponding to a particular
      activity depending on the interactions with energy fields inherent
      in a person or acquired by him, that is, a peculiar bioenergy
      approach is needed in planning the impact of electromagnetic
      fields on the human body and its biological field (bioenergy
      ecology ).<br>
      <br>
      The method takes into account the organization of optimal
      parameters of the human environment, taking into account the
      effect on his body of various stimuli of any energy nature,
      including the low-energy bioenergy effect. Electromagnetic fields
      (bioenergy effect) have the highest biological activity, the
      intensity of which varies from 10-2 to 10-16 W / cm2.<br>
      <br>
      The method takes into account the existing electromagnetic fields,
      which are divided into natural, which in turn, are divided into
      external - cosmic, geophysical, biological origin and internal,
      generated by various structural levels of the body, and artificial
      electromagnetic fields, which have now led to a possible threat of
      a peculiar " electromagnetic pollution. "<br>
      <br>
      The preventive effect and improvement of the human body according
      to this method are provided by the participation of all
      biochemical and mental processes, namely: sensation, perception,
      attention, memory, representation, imagination, thinking and
      emotions. And although these issues are not manifested separately
      and are found only in a specific set of their own, the optimal
      conditions for the prevention of diseases and the health of the
      body as a whole depend on the specific conditions of formation and
      course of each of these processes.<br>
      <br>
      Recently, a sufficiently large number of ways to protect and
      isolate a person from the effects of external field and energy
      factors have been developed. Today, methods are known to protect
      against some of the most powerful sources of pathogenic effects on
      a person, leading to the destruction of his delicate physical
      fields with very unpleasant consequences for him. This is: 1.
      Cosmic radiation 2. Geopathic zones 3. Socio-pathogenic effects 4.
      Technopathogenic Radiations To date, city dwellers are
      simultaneously exposed to all the listed pathological types of
      radiation.<br>
      <br>
      According to the proposed method, the human body is a balanced,
      self-regulating biosystem that is able to get rid of diseases
      itself, if conditions are created that comply with the laws of
      nature and do not contradict human ecology.<br>
      <br>
      Known methods allow to solve the problem of ensuring bioenergy
      ecology, taking into account only the influence of some of the
      above factors. It does not take into account the effect of other
      components of the general energy field and their impact on the
      person and his biological field as a whole. In addition, the known
      methods provide a bioenergy environment in small quantities and,
      most importantly, do not allow the management of the bioenergy
      state of the environment. They are mainly aimed at reducing the
      impact of harmful effects on the body by countering external
      pathogenic factors, when other measures cannot reduce their
      effects on the human body.<br>
      <br>
      The essence of the method of ensuring bioenergy ecology according
      to the present invention is as follows.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 1 is a picture of the effects of electromagnetic radiation on
      a portion of the earth’s surface. Figure 2 shows a separate
      section with a building located on it. Cosmic radiation, the
      Earth’s magnetic field, and geopathic magnetic fields act on every
      part of the earth’s surface. According to the present method of
      ensuring bioenergy ecology, before the construction of a building
      on the terrain, the direction of the geographic poles, the
      magnitude and direction of the Earth’s magnetic field, the
      location of the geopathogenic zones, block the geopathic zones at
      the site of the proposed construction, choose the place for the
      construction of the building and its location, the partitions
      inside the building , building and finishing materials, interior
      items and furniture, taking into account the psycho-physiological
      state of people, a cat They will live or work in the building. The
      psychophysiological state of people is determined by finding the
      integral indicator of tension by measuring the respiratory rate,
      pulse rate and indicators of the galvanic skin response, as well
      as using biolocation techniques and by analyzing birth horoscope.<br>
      <br>
      Choose the ratio of the geometric dimensions of the building, its
      length to width, based on ratios from 2: 3 to 10:10 meters,
      floor-by-floor works are carried out taking into account the
      period of the lunar month, after construction with the help of
      biolocation techniques determine the intended use of the premises
      adjacent to the building block the action of geopathogenic zones
      by planting tree species in their center, which accumulate natural
      energy, or fill their location with mineral energy concentrators,
      for example, granite rubble or white sand another cushion up to
      0.8 meters, and also on the adjacent territory, place plants and
      landscape objects, which accumulate cosmic energy and ensure the
      weakening of the negative effects of the geomagnetic field on the
      building and the space around it.<br>
      <br>
      Integral assessments of the person’s intensity are used in the
      differential diagnosis of the functional state of the person, in
      the analysis of work activity, in therapeutic relaxation and
      aesthetic therapeutic effects, in the assessment of
      psychophysiological tension, and in the assessment of stress (see
      Patent 2073484, A 61 N 1/16, 1996). These evaluative factors make
      it possible to adequately reflect the functional state at the time
      under study by integrating local indicators of the state of
      functional subsystems into a single assessment. The state of
      psychophysiological tension phylogenetically developed as a
      response to the mobilization of the functional reserves of the
      body in response to the action of a stress-induced stimulus. In
      this method, integral assessments are used according to the
      methodology used at the Institute of Medical and Biological
      Problems.<br>
      <br>
      According to this method, among the functional systems of the
      body, when exposed to a stress factor, first of all are mobilized:
      the cardio-respiratory system, which provides the body with energy
      balance and has a number of stable indicators, of which the
      duration of the cardiac cycle and respiratory cycle are the
      easiest to consider. In the known method uses the inverse values:
      heart rate (HR) and respiratory rate (RR); excretory system of
      sweating, an indicator of the state of which are galvanic skin
      reactions (GSR). The selected indicators mainly provide a reliable
      assessment.<br>
      <br>
      As an assessment of the state of the human body, an integrated
      assessment of tension can be used, which characterizes the
      psycho-physiological intensity depending on the magnitude of the
      respiratory rate, heart rate and indices of the galvanic skin
      response. For people who are in good psycho-physiological and
      emotional state, this combined indicator is in the range of
      0.2-0.5. The turning angle of the building is 5o-23o. At this
      angle of reversal, the geomagnetic field partially penetrates into
      separate spaces of the room, which makes it possible not to
      disturb the biorhythms of the body and maintain the relationship
      of the organism with the environment, reducing the effect of
      electromagnetic fields on the human body to safe limits (about 1.2
      µV / M in the electrical component and 12 µA / M in the magnetic
      component, the pulsation period from 50 s to 650 s). For people
      who are irritable, with a weakened immune system and suffering
      from diseases, the level of action of the electromagnetic field
      should be minimal, amounting to about 1 MKV / M in the electrical
      component and 10 MkA / M in the magnetic component, the pulsation
      period is from 1 to 600 s, in order not to disrupt the biorhythms
      of the body and biochemical processes occurring in the normal
      state.<br>
      <br>
      The turning angle of the building in this case is 24-43o.<br>
      <br>
      For people who are calm and balanced, to improve their well-being,
      increase immunity, it is necessary to increase the level of
      penetration of the electromagnetic field and cosmic radiation into
      the building within the limits not exceeding the required level of
      safety.<br>
      <br>
      In tab. 1 shows the relationship between the levels of the
      psycho-physiological state of people and the levels of
      electromagnetic radiation to determine the internal layout of the
      building, obtained experimentally.<br>
      <br>
      Premises that exceed the level of the electromagnetic field shown
      in the table are not intended for people to remain in them for a
      long time and can be used for household purposes: as utility
      rooms, storerooms, toilets, etc.<br>
      <br>
      Considering that integral assessments of the tensions of people
      living in a house over time can vary under the influence of
      various factors, their use for solving the problems posed in this
      invention only tentatively allows us to determine the position of
      a building under construction. More stable results will be
      obtained when using bioenergetic characteristics for assessing the
      psychophysiological state of a person, obtained by a known
      biolocation method using frameworks or pendulums of conventional
      construction.<br>
      <br>
      In tab. 2 shows the approximate values of the angles of rotation
      of the framework, corresponding to different levels of the
      psycho-physiological state of people, and the angles of rotation
      of the building relative to the azimuth, depending on the
      parameters obtained, obtained experimentally.<br>
      <br>
      As the most constant in its influence of the intensity parameter
      of the psycho-emotional and energy fields of a person, practically
      independent of external stress conditions, one can consider the
      susceptibility of the organism and its systems to certain
      reactions to external stress factors, which is calculated based on
      the astrological chart of the person’s birth (horoscope) using
      known techniques. The planets of the Solar System project their
      energy and electromagnetic effects in the range of supersmall
      radiation on the surface of the Earth and living organisms.
      Obtained at the time of birth of a person, the influences of
      planets and distant stars, considered in astrology, have an effect
      on the state of the human body, its bioenergetic characteristics
      and the course of life processes in general at all stages of the
      life cycle. Temporary changes in the characteristics of the human
      biofield are superimposed on the effects obtained at the time of
      birth, and thus lead to certain changes in the psychophysiological
      state, which can be calculated based on the analysis of the
      astrological chart of birth of a person (horoscope).<br>
      <br>
      In this way, one can determine the adaptive abilities of a person
      as a whole and correctly assess the body’s ability to protect
      against field effects of the external environment, as well as
      calculate the direction in azimuth, which allows a person to
      restore the integrity of the aura field after the action of
      negative energy factors.<br>
      <br>
      In tab. 3 shows the relationship between the indicators of the
      person’s birth horoscope and the total intensity of its
      electromagnetic field, as well as the corresponding angles of
      rotation of the building under construction in azimuthal
      projection, obtained experimentally.<br>
      <br>
      The position of the structure, decoration materials, color gamma
      and interior items selected from an astrological point of view
      attract the favorable influence of the planets and other
      astrological factors considered in the proportions necessary for
      the organism, thereby exerting its unique healing effect on the
      person.<br>
      <br>
      The construction of a new object or the reconstruction of an old
      one is most efficiently carried out taking into account certain
      phases of the Moon, which has a pronounced effect on the course of
      energy and physical processes on the Earth in general and in the
      human body and its mental sphere in particular. Despite the fact
      that the influence of the moon is only a part of the general
      energy influences of cosmic natural phenomena, the high
      significance of such influence does not require explanations and
      evidence. The moon causes the ebb and flow of the oceans, causes
      the earth's crust to rise. The moon affects the entire mass of
      plasma in the body and its nervous activity. It has even more
      pronounced effect on the human energy capabilities. Thus, during a
      full moon, the intensity of a person's weak electromagnetic fields
      becomes most noticeable, and therefore the bioenergetic effect
      exerted on him must be calming. During the new moon, the field
      characteristics of the aura are noticeably reduced and the field
      strength drops - it is necessary to carry out a tonic effect on
      the body to increase vitality and enhance the adaptive
      capabilities of the individual.<br>
      <br>
      At the same time, the impact on the biological energy field of a
      person on the first day of the lunar month should be minimal,
      gradually increasing in the following days until the full moon.
      Then the impact should decrease proportionally, reaching a minimum
      by the end of the lunar month, on the border of the next new moon.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, the period of the lunar month, lasting about 29.5 solar
      days, can be divided into several periods, carrying an independent
      energy characteristic. In this regard, construction works are also
      divided into several stages, directly dependent on the
      characteristics of the energy of lunar influences on the surface
      of our planet and the flow of individual or mass energy
      interactions. Starting construction, determine the specific lunar
      day and the magnitude of the electromagnetic field on that day in
      a given area of construction. Carrying out operations to ensure
      bioenergy ecology, ensure that the true magnitude of the
      electromagnetic field is between the value corresponding to the
      period of the new moon, and the value falling in the middle of the
      lunar month. In this case, the minimum value corresponds to the
      minimum allowable from the point of view of maintaining the normal
      biorhythmic action of the body, and the magnitude of the
      electromagnetic field in the middle of the lunar month should not
      exceed the maximum value allowed for the proper functioning of the
      organs and body systems.<br>
      <br>
      In this case, according to the present invention, there is no
      violation of the influence of monthly lunar rhythms on the human
      biological field, and the magnitudes of the electromagnetic field
      level are within safe limits.<br>
      <br>
      In view of the foregoing, it is advisable to carry out the
      calculation of the construction of a building in time as follows:
      marking in kind the house plan and arranging the rags, auxiliary
      devices for excavation work produce favorable lunar days before
      the full moon; earthworks and foundation construction, as well as
      the construction of underground parts of the future structure
      (basements, cellars, underground garages, etc.) are carried out in
      the second half of the lunar month. By the second half of the
      lunar month, it is also desirable to tie the end of any stage of
      construction work, followed by a change in the technology of
      further work (for example, complete the construction of walls and
      ceilings, complete interior decorating, etc.); the beginning of
      the construction and erection of the walls must be tied to the
      first half of the lunar month, it is desirable to begin these
      works in the first quarter of the moon; on lunar days that are
      critical in terms of their energy and electromagnetic
      characteristics (9, 15, 23, 29 days of the lunar calendar), it is
      better not to do serious work and limit the removal of
      deficiencies, garbage disposal, etc. types of work.<br>
      <br>
      The geometric dimensions of the building have a direct impact on
      the bioenergy situation in the building by setting a specific
      electromagnetic field, which results in the emergence of stable
      energy flows inside the building, the formation of so-called
      "energy drafts" affecting the energy of the rooms and people in
      them. Constant impact of energy in one direction relative to the
      geomagnetic field and interior items negatively affects the
      stability of the energy field of biological objects and can lead
      to a deterioration of human well-being, reduced body defenses and
      thus violate the created conditions of bioenergy ecology in the
      building. In tab. 4 shows the dependencies of the distribution of
      the energy potential of the active field on the geometric
      dimensions of the building (the ratio of the transverse size of
      the building to its length) experimentally obtained by the
      biolocation method.<br>
      <br>
      Abbreviations: DO - long axis of the structure, emergency
      situation - circularly clockwise, PNL - circularly
      counterclockwise.<br>
      The table below shows that the most optimal ratios that ensure the
      most favorable bio-energy impact on people inside the building are
      the following ratios of geometric dimensions: 8:10, 7:10, 5: 6, 5:
      8, 9:10, 8: 8 m .<br>
      <br>
      Pick up building materials that will be used in the construction
      of a residential building, guided by the principle of maximum
      protection of the internal space of the building from the
      penetration of harmful electromagnetic radiation. As building
      materials, ordinary materials used in civil engineering are used:
      brick, wood, sand, etc. taking into account their interaction with
      electromagnetic fields.<br>
      <br>
      Then calculate the position of the internal partitions of the
      building and determine the layout of the floor levels of the
      building, guided by the psycho-physiological and emotional state
      of people, the level of electromagnetic fields and the time people
      in these rooms.<br>
      <br>
      After determining the layout inside the building, the finishing of
      the building inside and outside is evaluated in terms of the
      protective effect of the finishing materials. Outside, a building
      can be lined with mineral and wood materials, bioactive materials
      (for example, with the addition of ebonite) and other natural
      materials, which make it possible to create fields opposing
      destructive external fields by accumulating cosmic energy. The
      interior of the building is made on the basis of calculating the
      parameters of the mutual influence of the used finishing materials
      on the human body and its subtle energy components. Due to this
      decision and careful selection of materials for each room based on
      its purpose, the energy and electromagnetic fields inside the
      building are aligned to the optimal parameters for living people.
      When this occurs, the alignment of a person's own energy field
      with the subsequent optimization of the psycho-physiological
      status. Indoors, the intensity of a constant electric field is
      zero, and low-frequency pulsations of the geomagnetic field,
      useful for the body from 1 to 600 s, achieve a fairly low level of
      radiation, having a positive effect on the human body.<br>
      <br>
      It should be noted that the present method provides for individual
      finishing of premises both outside and inside to increase the
      efficiency of a person’s recovery. To this end, in separate rooms,
      various tree species with a favorable electromagnetic potential
      (birch, oak, pine, linden, apple, etc.) can be used for
      decoration. Wood has a protective effect from those streams of
      harmful energy that permeate the room. On the other hand, it acts
      as a source of favorable energy due to its accumulation from outer
      space. Therefore, according to the method, the furniture for the
      premises is selected individually from natural wood and is located
      in the form of an additional barrier in relation to the direction
      of the geomagnetic field of the Earth. In the interior, it is
      necessary to use natural minerals as accumulators of cosmic
      radiation of a favorable range.<br>
      <br>
      Given the importance of cosmic radiation of a particular type of
      formation of electromagnetic fields inside and outside the
      building, in this method, the most important for the life of the
      organism emit radiation spectra corresponding to the planets of
      the solar system. Each planet of the Solar System has a
      predominant influence on the nature of its own mineral and
      vegetable kingdom, respectively, on the organs and systems of the
      human body, which also are based on mineral and plant elements.
      Minerals and materials selected according to cosmobiological laws,
      entering into interaction with the organism, attract the favorable
      influence of the planets in the proportions necessary for the
      organism, thereby exerting its unique healing effect on humans.<br>
      <br>
      To ensure bioenergy environmental cleanliness in the adjacent
      territory, which has a direct impact on the bioenergy state of the
      building, the following actions are planned that characterize the
      method of the invention: blocking geopathogenic zones located
      around the structure; the use of landscape areas, planting as
      protection against the adverse effects of electromagnetic fields;
      redistribution of energy of geopathic zones into zones that are
      safe for people through the use of various building materials.<br>
      <br>
      At the last stage, the selection of color combinations of the
      interior and the interior arrangement of the premises are carried
      out, taking into account the effects of certain flowers, symbols
      and plants on the human body.<br>
      <br>
      The red color has a positive effect on the muscular and
      circulatory systems; on the cardiovascular system - green;
      respiratory tract - blue; bone system - blue; on the sexual
      sphere, gynecology, urology - orange; on the nervous system and
      the general state of the body's immune system - yellow; on the
      system of the endocrine glands - purple, etc.<br>
      <br>
      It is desirable that the windows were located on the south or east
      side. The location of the mirrors is also chosen in a special way
      so that the mirror surface contributes to a uniform distribution
      of energy around the room, focusing it in a given direction and in
      no way contributes to the formation of an "energy corridor" that
      can become a conductor of hard negative electromagnetic radiation
      in the room, breaking the external protection of the room.<br>
      <br>
      Using fabric or other materials, it is desirable to create a
      classic color rainbow, where each color carries its own vibration
      frequency and enters into resonance with certain organs and
      systems of the human body, creating conditions for the prevention
      of disease and the healing of the human body. The visual rhythm
      perceived visually, has a linear embodiment in space and on the
      plane with the help of a uniform alternation of certain forms and
      their interrelations in various optical phenomena. The rhythm
      realized on the plane can be represented as a combination and
      repetition of colors, in the dynamics of their interconnection and
      transitions. The linear direction of the rhythm is manifested in
      painting, drawing, etc. By selecting certain combinations of color
      and rhythmic gamut of graphic elements, an electromagnetic
      background is created that directs the body to internal healing,
      purification from toxins and negative energy. The method according
      to this invention determines the correct orientation with respect
      to magnetic lines of force and cosmic radiation of interior
      objects, furniture.<br>
      <br>
      Energy fields of interior items, furniture should have pronounced
      energy blocking properties with respect to negative components of
      the electromagnetic field. The placement of certain types of
      plants should create a favorable energy background for restoring
      the forces lost during the day and the fastest restoration of the
      normal energy structure of a human biofield. The placement of
      animal species with a clearly defined location is possible with
      the aim of using their bioenergy potential to create a bioenergy
      environment favorable to human health.<br>
      <br>
      At present, the mechanisms of influence on the bioenergy situation
      around a person of individual factors considered are quite well
      known and well substantiated. However, the use of complex effects
      and the management of these effects are not sufficiently
      effective. There is no integrated approach in the application of
      these methods in civil and industrial construction, planning,
      redevelopment and major repairs of buildings. Therefore, the
      proposed method is new in comparison with previously known. The
      high efficiency of the method is achieved due to the following
      actions characterizing the presented method as an invention: it
      ensures bioenergy ecological cleanliness in a building, dwelling
      by choosing a building site by finding and blocking the action of
      geopathogenic zones, predicting their influence on the energy
      ecology, reducing the influence of the magnetic field of the Earth
      and space radiation due to the special orientation of the building
      relative to geographic poles, taking into account the
      psycho-physiological and emotional s the feelings of the people
      living in it, the choice of optimal from an energetic point of
      view ratios of the geometric dimensions of the structure, the
      selection of energetically advantageous building and finishing
      materials protecting or revealing the human aura of a person, as
      well as the basic combinations of the color scheme of the
      interior, an energetic layout of the rooms and structures of the
      structure, proper orientation with respect to magnetic field lines
      and cosmic radiation of home furnishings, furniture, etc .;
      ensuring bioenergy environmental cleanliness in the adjacent
      territory through the use of the protective effect of landscape
      items, planting plants and placing certain species of animals in a
      protected place; choosing the time to start construction, ensuring
      the energy security of the house and its durability.<br>
      <br>
      The proposed method allows you to create optimal conditions for
      bioenergy ecology, aimed at preventing diseases and healing the
      human body, improving efficiency and improving the immune system
      without the use of drugs and pharmacological agents. <br>

      <br>
      SUBSTANCE: method involves acting on both biolocation operators
      brain hemispheres by non-contact, remote control of pulsating low
      frequency monopolar magnetic field with adjustable values. When
      selected by operator himself, biological object (organism or
      system of organisms or its parts like organs, tissues, cellular
      elements including blood, sperm) at the stage of irreversible
      transformation (death) are placed between the field source and
      temporal region of working operator as initiators of its intuition
      capacity. Initiators of high level of biological and specific
      organization functioning before starting initial stage of
      destruction and applying biological initiators destruction methods
      distinguished by their crude prolonged stages of final death are
      also usable. Magnetic pulses produced by oscillator stimulate both
      hemispheres of the brain of biolocation operator under test
      synchronously with factor action bringing irreversible destruction
      resulting in death to biological object used as initiator of
      intuition capacity of biolocation operator. EFFECT: improved
      reliability of biolocation studies.<br>
      <br>
      The invention relates to medicine, namely the physiology of labor
      and can be used by biolocation operators to increase the
      reliability of the results of their biolocation studies.<br>
      <br>
      Biolocation studies are carried out using special indicators
      (accessories) - a forked wood branch with an L-shaped frame, a
      pendulum, etc. (Mizun Yu.G. Biopathogenic zones - the threat of
      diseases. - M., 1993).<br>
      <br>
      The method of "dowsing" is known, which boils down to the fact
      that in some people, when passing them over aquifer, ore, or other
      abnormal zones, there is a deviation or rotation of an accessory
      squeezed in the hand, for example, hazelnut or willow branches
      (Malakhov AA minerals. - Questions and Answers, 1973, N 3).<br>
      <br>
      According to some researchers, 15 to 95% of the people surveyed
      have this ability. However, only gifted biolocation operators get
      good results after long and hard training (NN Sochanovov, V.S.
      Matveev. The biophysical method in geological studies. - Geology
      of ore deposits. 1974, t. 16, N 5; Bakirov A.G. Geological
      possibilities of the biophysical method. - In the book: Collection
      of reports of the conference on the study of psychotronics. T. 1.,
      Prague, 1973; Bondarev B.V. Biophysical effect and its use in the
      search for minerals. - Scientific works of the Tashkent State.
      University, 1970, vol. 372).<br>
      <br>
      There are no equipment and techniques that increase the
      reliability of the results of the work of the biolocation
      operators. All this makes it difficult to widely use dowsing
      testing at the present time.<br>
      <br>
      The guides to the "dowsing" emphasizes that in order to achieve
      maximum reliability of the exploration work, the wood branch used
      as an accessory should be freshly cut (MV Lomonosov, On
      ore-prospecting forks. - V. khn .: First foundations of metallurgy
      or ore mining. - 1763; Blaumang M. Why the flyer rotates? -
      Science and technology, 1975, N 1; Morish Yu.I., Turobov BV
      Dowsing, without mysticism. - Nature, 1986, N 11).<br>
      <br>
      The authors were interested in this statement, and the experiments
      with the "vine" allowed us to formulate a working hypothesis,
      according to which the synchronized interaction of the biolocation
      operator with any actively functioning biological system or its
      components that are subject to intense destruction significantly
      increases the accuracy of biolocation studies. The percentage of
      increase in reliability depends on the intuitive abilities of the
      operator and the level of the biological organization of the
      collapsing system or the functional significance of its components
      used.<br>
      <br>
      The authors analyzed historical data on the appearance of
      "prophets" during the years of social or geophysical upheavals,
      ritual features of sacrifices, shamanism and witchcraft from the
      standpoint of the theory of the entropic logic of Theodore
      Van-Howen.<br>
      <br>
      There is a method of increasing the efficiency of aviation profile
      operators and a device for its implementation by exposing the
      cycles of mechanical stimuli with needles to the reflexogenic
      zones of the skin of the chest, back, abdomen, thighs and
      shoulders (as USSR N 738226, A 61 N 1/32, 1981).<br>
      <br>
      This technical solution for dowsing operators is not acceptable
      due to the peculiarities of their workplace, special equipment and
      activity algorithm. In addition, the device-prototype does not
      allow to adjust the degree of exposure of mechanical stimuli to
      the body of a particular operator and does not exclude trauma to
      the skin.<br>
      <br>
      There is a method of improving the performance of the operator of
      the aviation profile by applying electrodes to the back and hip
      skin, which are connected to the generator of electrical impulses
      that are adjustable in frequency and amplitude, selected
      individually. There are two possible modes of operation: the
      inclusion of stimulation periodically with the appearance of
      drowsiness and muscle discomfort or constantly in the process of
      work (RF patent N 2006234 C1, cl. A 61 N 1/32).<br>
      <br>
      There is a method of preventing people from overworking and
      increasing their efficiency by deepening and increasing the
      duration of natural sleep due to exposure of the brain to
      electromagnetic oscillations in the form of pulsed signals, which
      are adjustable in shape, frequency, duration, duty cycle and
      amplitude (a. S. USSR N 700140, cl. A 61 N 1/32, 30.11.79, US
      patents N 3989051, N 4334525 of 15.06.82, N 4383522 of 17.05.83 -
      devices like "Lenar").<br>
      <br>
      Closest to the claimed method is the impact on the central nervous
      system pulsed currents (and.with. USSR N 904720, cl. And 61 N
      1/34, 15.02.82, author E.M. Kastrubin) by means of four electrodes
      placed on the skin, installed in the frontal region and in the
      region of the mastoid processes.<br>
      <br>
      The main disadvantage of the above prototypes is the subjective
      setting of the operating mode by selecting the strength of the
      acting current, focusing on the discomfort of a particular subject
      at the overlapping points of the electrodes.<br>
      <br>
      As a result of the analysis of the level of technology, it has
      been established that the task of increasing the reliability of
      biolocation research by using any physical factors has not yet
      been solved.<br>
      <br>
      The objective of the invention is to develop a method that
      increases the reliability of the results of the dowsing operators
      more than 80%.<br>
      <br>
      The task is achieved by affecting both hemispheres of the brain of
      a biolocation operator with a pulsed low-frequency unipolar
      magnetic field with adjustable parameters, provided that the
      characteristics of the acting magnetic field are chosen by the
      biolocation operator, and between the magnetic field inductor and
      the temporal region of the working operator is placed an actively
      functioning biological object (organism, system organisms) or its
      constituent parts (organs, tissues, cellular elements, including
      blood, semen) in Tadia irreversible destruction (death).<br>
      <br>
      The method is based on the discovery of the Nobel laureate in the
      field of physics by Denny Gabor, the essence of which is that,
      regardless of the type of death (mechanical destruction,
      overheating, overcooling or poisoning), a biological object at the
      time of death sharply increases photon emission, regardless of
      whether it is animal or vegetable. organisms (Parapsychology:
      Training course of the Munich Institute of Parapsychology. M.
      1992).<br>
      <br>
      The magnetic impulses generated by the generator affect the
      hemispheres of the brain of the test biolocation operator
      synchronously with the influence of factors carrying irreversible
      damage used as an initiator of the intuitive abilities of the
      biolocation operator to a biological object, leading to its death.<br>
      <br>
      The invention consists in the following. Previously tested as a
      biolocation operator selects the optimal values of the parameters
      of magnetic pulses generated by inductors, which have the maximum
      effect on him: the polarity of the magnetic field for the right
      and left hemispheres, the values of the carrier frequency,
      magnetic induction, interruption frequency and duty cycle of the
      generated unipolar magnetic pulses filled with the carrier
      frequency .<br>
      <br>
      In order to objectively control the magnitude of the reliability
      of the work performed as a biolocation operator, the subject was
      asked to identify one of three or five Zener cards containing
      various geometric shapes (square, triangle, cross, circle and two
      parallel lines).<br>
      <br>
      Each of the cards was previously placed in an envelope of thick
      non-transparent paper, and the envelopes were mixed in the absence
      of the subjects. This technique is known as the Wright test.<br>
      <br>
      Then a biological object used as a biological initiator (single
      microorganisms or their colonies, various plants and animals) or
      its parts (biological fluids, cellular elements and their
      homogenates) was placed between the temporal region of the head of
      the test subject and one of the magnetic inductors. A biological
      object must be functionally active, but be in the initial stage of
      irreversible damage, which must inevitably end with its death.<br>
      <br>
      The authors used known exposure factors leading to the destruction
      and death of biological objects: mechanical damage including
      decapitation and bloodletting models, freezing, poisoning,
      multiple burns (thermal and acidic), hunger, dehydration, hypoxia
      and asphyxiation, the effects of electric current, hard ionizing
      radiation and a number of proprietary techniques, such as exposure
      to a laser beam.<br>
      <br>
      Against the background of the artificially induced destruction and
      death of the biological object or system used, the main test and
      statistical processing of the obtained data were performed.<br>
      <br>
      The invention is confirmed by the following examples.<br>
      <br>
      A group of subjects (n = 12) was asked to perform a Wright test in
      order to objectively control their credibility as biolocation
      operators, that is, to determine one of five Zener maps containing
      various geometric shapes (square, triangle, cross, circle and two
      parallel lines).<br>
      <br>
      Each of the cards was previously placed in an envelope of thick
      non-transparent paper and the envelopes were mixed in the absence
      of the subjects.<br>
      <br>
      In the control determination of Zener maps, a preliminary
      biolocation operator selected the optimal values of the parameters
      of the magnetic pulses generated by the inductors, which exerted
      the maximum effect on him by the angle of deviation of the
      L-shaped biolocation frame. Then between the temporal region of
      the head of the subject and one of the magnetic inductors was
      placed a Petri dish with a culture of microorganisms Escherichia
      Coli on a nutrient medium. After that, a Petri dish was poured
      with 10 ml of a 1% phenol solution as an antiseptic and 5 minutes
      after the start of sterilization against the background of mass
      death of individual individuals and the entire colony of used
      microorganisms, the main study was performed.<br>
      <br>
      When using the proposed method, the amount of reliable information
      was 68.4 +/- 6.18% with a mathematical expectation of 20%. In the
      control studies, respectively, 51.34 +/- 10.27% with the same
      expectation of 20%. The probability of accidentally obtaining this
      result was less than 0.05.<br>
      <br>
      In the next series of experiments, laboratory animals (white mice,
      rats, guinea pigs, and dogs) were decapitated.<br>
      For the decapitation of animals, the authors designed a special
      guillotine, the design features of which are the subject of their
      own invention.<br>
      <br>
      Carcasses of agonizing animals and their severed heads were placed
      between one of the magnetic inductors and the head of the
      operator, after which the Wright test was performed. Preliminary
      control studies were carried out when live animals were placed
      between the magnetic field inductor and the operator in comparison
      with the initial control test — without using a biological object
      as an initiator of the abilities of the biolocation operator.<br>
      <br>
      When using the proposed method, the amount of reliable information
      was when white mice were slaughtered: 69.22 +/- 6.31% (in the
      control, when used in the experiment of live animals - 52.16 +/-
      9.26%), when using white rats : 80.14 +/- 6.42% (in the control,
      when using live animals in the experiment - 64.53 +/- 8.17%).<br>
      guinea pigs: 69.8 9 + / 8.41% (in control, when using live animals
      in an experiment - 55.34 +/- 7.13%), rabbits: 76.18 +/- 7.64% (in
      control, when used in the experiment of live animals - 56,45 +/-
      8.06%), dogs: 82.64 +/- 7.88% (in control, when used in the
      experiment of live animals - 67.13 +/- 8, 32%).<br>
      <br>
      The experimental section of the work was carried out in the
      laboratory of the Department of Topographic Anatomy and Operative
      Surgery of the Omsk Medical Academy (head of the department is
      Professor, Corresponding Member of the Academy of Medical and
      Technical Sciences, Yelomenko SN).<br>
      <br>
      The highest rates: 84.82 +/- 8.14% (in the control, when using a
      live animal in the experiment - 66.48 +/- 7.71%) were obtained
      during the experiment with the rhesus monkey, provided by the
      representative of HGY Ltd . in Omsk, funding research authors.<br>
      <br>
      The Wright test without the use of biological objects as
      initiators averaged 50.07 +/- 12.34%.<br>
      <br>
      When analyzing the obtained results, the authors noticed that the
      Wright test was higher in all cases among the operators who
      directly carried out the decapitation of animals when young,
      actively functioning and healthy animals were slaughtered and
      depended on the level of the species organization of the
      biological object used.<br>
      <br>
      Wright's test was maximal when synchronizing the work of a
      biolocation operator with the influence of factors destroying the
      biological system, that is, when using just slaughtered animals,
      then gradually decreased and dropped sharply after 1.5-2.5 days
      (in different species) provided the corpses were stored room
      temperature.<br>
      <br>
      At the same time, the authors conducted studies on the possibility
      of using various organs, tissues and cellular elements extracted
      from animals and humans as biological initiators, as well as
      embryo tissues (fetal tissues after abortion) and babies who died
      during childbirth or the first hours and days after birth .<br>
      <br>
      The animals were used after slaughter and death as a result of
      modeling a fatal disease (peritonitis) or poisoning (overdose
      during anesthesia). Similar studies were conducted with organs
      taken from the bodies of people who died as a result of an
      accident, accident, forcibly or after a suicidal attempt, as well
      as as a result of a serious, incurable disease (oncopathology).<br>
      <br>
      This section of the work was carried out on the basis of the
      pathological-anatomical building of the Omsk Medical Academy,
      together with the staff of the Department of Pathological Anatomy,
      Forensic Medicine, and was supervised by the city police
      department and the FSB.<br>
      <br>
      The lowest rates are obtained when working with bone tissue as a
      biological initiator, the highest in blood, heart and brain
      tissue.<br>
      <br>
      As an example, the values of Wright’s test, obtained when using
      various monkeys as rhesus tissues as an initiator: bone tissue -
      54.47 +/- 11.18%, muscle tissue - 56.34 +/- 12.31%, skin and hair
      - 67.13 +/- 12.59%, liver tissue - 67.84 +/- 12.64%, testes -
      74.69 +/- 18.35%, blood - 78.43 +/- 18 , 49%, cardiac tissue -
      80.21 +/- 19.17%, and finally brain tissue - 82.93 +/- 20.12%.<br>
      <br>
      Higher rates were found when working with fetal tissues, not with
      a single organ, but with its homogenate, treated with concentrated
      sulfuric acid or placed under a laser beam or between carbon
      electrodes, periodically creating, in conjunction with the
      operation of a magnetic inductor and a biolocation operator, an
      electrical corona discharge.<br>
      <br>
      Wright's highest test was obtained when working with the corpse of
      citizen S., 36 years old. Death occurred as a result of multiple
      gunshot wounds to the abdomen and lower extremities from the loss
      of a critical blood volume. 9 hours after death, Wright's test was
      96.42 +/- 12.34%, a day later it dropped to 88.34 +/- 11.24%,
      after three days to 74.82 +/- 10.18%.<br>
      <br>
      When working with the corpse of a pensioner Yu., 76 years old, who
      died on the background of multiple metastases to the mesenteric
      lymph nodes against the background of severe cachexia, with a
      clinical diagnosis: gastric cancer Art. Wright's IV test, carried
      out 4 hours after death, was 79.47 +/- 10.21%, in a day: 71.13 +/-
      9.97%, in three days: 56.39 +/- 8.75%.<br>
      <br>
      In conclusion, the possibility of using as initiators of patients
      with severe chronic (oncological) diseases of the brain was
      evaluated.<br>
      <br>
      So the patient N., 49 years old with a diagnosis of cerebral
      meduloblastoma IV Art. (died 9 weeks after the study) Wright's
      test was 79.13 +/- 10.17%.<br>
      <br>
      When working with patient S., 54 years old (diagnosis: an
      extracerebral brain tumor), Wright’s test was 72.26 +/- 10.11%.<br>
      Thus, it was concluded that the younger, functionally active is
      the biological object used as a biological initiator of the
      intuitive abilities of biolocation operators, the harder its
      destruction and death occurs, the higher the percentage of
      guessing Zener maps from those tested as biolocation operators. If
      a biological object used as a biological initiator of intuitive
      abilities of biolocation operators is functionally inferior, has
      chronic diseases or intoxications, its reproducible death
      mechanism is fleeting, the lower the percentage of guesses among
      those tested as biolocation operators.<br>
      <br>
      To facilitate the statistical processing of the received data at
      the time of setting up the magnetic inductors, the authors
      developed a special computer program.<br>
      <br>
      In their work, the authors used a serial magnetic pulse generator
      of the “Gradient” type, equipped with a current interrupter in the
      magnetic inductor circuit and modified for separate adjustment of
      the parameters of N - S inductors, coupled with a computer control
      program and a sound card.<br>
      <br>
      The inventive method was tested by the authors when conducting
      medical biolocation diagnosis in order to determine the
      possibilities of verification of the diagnosis in patients with
      cancer pathology, confirmed on the surgical table and predict the
      life expectancy of the subjects (cancer of the stomach, breast,
      head of the pancreas, uterus, lungs). These studies were carried
      out in the pathological-anatomical building of the Omsk Medical
      Academy by Associate Professor of the Department of Topographical
      Anatomy and Operative Surgery, Bout Yu.S.<br>
      <br>
      The resulting increase in the reliability of biolocation studies
      using the proposed method allowed the authors to successfully test
      it when guessing the winning numbers of money-store lotteries. The
      number of winnings in the group of subjects exposed to a magnetic
      field in the presence of a biological initiator (cadaveric
      material) was 3.7 times higher than in the control group. <br>

      SUBSTANCE: biolocation operator's brain is subjected to remote
      contactless exposure to pulse low-frequency unipolar magnetic
      field with controllable values of polarity, carrier frequency,
      magnetic induction, interruption frequency, and relative pulse
      duration, with pulse being filled with carried-frequency current.
      Selection of magnetic field polarity for right- and left-hand
      cerebral hemispheres, as well as of parameters of formed unipolar
      magnetic pulses are performed by biolocation operator with use of
      biolocation frame or other accessories. Device for exposure to
      magnetic field has magnetic inductors made as solenoids in form of
      spiral coils. The latter are manufactured of copper wire with
      core, positioned above right- and left-hand temporal regions of
      biolocation operator's brain and connected to generator of
      unipolar low-frequency magnetic pulses which has common carrier
      frequency of sinusoidal current for both inductors within 50-1000
      Hz. Device also includes interrupters connected to supply circuit
      of inductors to control modulation frequency of magnetic pulses
      within the range of 1-10 Hz, correct to 0.01 Hz, with relative
      pulse duration of 5 to 95%. Magnetic pulses formed by magnetic
      inductors act on cerebral brain hemispheres in synchronism with
      action of specific stimulators on peripheral sections of visual
      and acoustic analyzers. Specific stimulators are formed by means
      of personal computer provided with colored monitor and sound
      tracking circuit or with aid of peripheral devices- synthesizers
      controlled by computer. EFFECT: enhanced stability and truth. <br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      The invention relates to the field of medicine, namely the
      physiology of labor, and can be used to increase stability and
      increase the degree of reliability of the results of the work of
      operators, such as biolocation, when they conduct biolocation
      studies.<br>
      <br>
      There is a method of improving human performance and a device for
      its implementation by exposing the cycles of mechanical stimuli
      using needles to the reflexogenic zones of the skin of the chest,
      back, abdomen, thighs and shoulders (a. S. USSR N 738226, A 61 N
      1/32, 1981). This technical solution for dowsing operators is
      unacceptable due to the peculiarities of their workplace,
      specials. equipment and activity algorithm. In addition, the
      device-prototype does not allow to adjust the degree of exposure
      of mechanical stimuli to the body of a particular operator and
      does not exclude trauma to the skin.<br>
      <br>
      It is known that one of the possible and least time-consuming ways
      to increase the efficiency and reliability of an operator’s work
      is the effect on the central nervous system (CNS) by electrical
      impulses. There is a method of increasing the efficiency of an
      aviation profile operator, often working in extreme situations,
      when the lives of many people depend on the clarity and
      correctness of his professional actions. To do this, electrodes
      are applied to the skin of the back and thighs, which are
      connected to the generator of electrical impulses that are
      adjustable in frequency in the range from 20 to 10.0000 Hz and the
      amplitude selected individually.<br>
      <br>
      There are two possible modes of operation: the inclusion of
      stimulation periodically with the appearance of drowsiness and
      muscle discomfort or constantly in the process of work (RF patent
      N 2006234 C1, A 61 N 1/32).<br>
      <br>
      There is a method of preventing overworking people and increasing
      their efficiency by deepening and lengthening natural sleep due to
      exposure to the brain by electromagnetic oscillations in the form
      of pulse signals, which are regulated in shape, frequency,
      duration, duty cycle and amplitude (AC USSR N 700140, A 61 N 1/32
      , Bull. 44 from 30.11.79, US Patents N 3989051, N 4334525 from
      15.06.82, N 4383522 from 17.05.83 - devices like "Lenar").<br>
      <br>
      Also known is a method of affecting the central nervous system by
      pulsed currents (AC USSR N 904720, A 61 N 1/34, Bull. 6 dated
      02.15.82, by EM Kastrubin) by means of four electrodes placed on
      the skin in the frontal area and in the area mastoid processes.<br>
      <br>
      Although this prototype is not designed to increase stability and
      increase the degree of reliability of the results of the operators
      and therefore cannot be used as a counterpart, indirectly
      improving performance by preventing overworking people, achieved
      by EM Kastrubin naturally affects the quality of their
      professional workload.<br>
      <br>
      The main disadvantage of the above prototypes is the subjective
      setting of the operating mode by selecting the strength of the
      acting current, focusing on the unpleasant sensations of a
      particular person at the points where the electrodes are applied.<br>
      <br>
      As the closest analogue can be considered a device for exposure to
      a magnetic field (DE 4420233 A1, Gluck, Daniel 15.12.94, A 61 N
      2/04).<br>
      <br>
      The objective of the invention is to develop a method of
      increasing stability and increasing the degree of reliability of
      the results of the work of biolocation operators and to
      manufacture a device for its implementation.<br>
      <br>
      The task is achieved by simultaneously affecting the brain of
      biolocation operators in the process of S and N magnetic inductors
      installed respectively over the right and left temporal areas of
      the head and forming a pulsed magnetic field modulated by
      rectangular pulses, the parameters of which provide the maximum
      effect, while the biolocation operator preselects magnetic field
      parameters by changing the carrier frequency and the amplitude of
      the current feeding the magnetic inductors, frequency mode yatsii
      and duty cycle to a value rendering it maximum stimulating effect.<br>
      <br>
      A device for applying a magnetic field is represented by magnetic
      inductors, which are connected to the outputs of a two-channel
      generator of unipolar sinusoidal low-frequency current pulses with
      a carrier frequency of 50-1000 Hz, in addition, interrupters are
      included in the power supply circuit of the inductors to control
      the frequency of modulation of magnetic pulses from 1 Hz to 10 Hz
      with an accuracy of 0.1 Hz and a duty cycle from 5% to 95%, while
      the magnetic inductors are made in the form of spiral coils of
      copper wire with a core with the possibility of installation on e
      the right and left temporal regions of the brain of a working
      biolocation operator, and the generator allows to regulate the
      parameters of the current channels separately.<br>
      <br>
      The authors carried out the main section of the work with
      certified biolocation operators; therefore, additionally, over
      time, the magnetic pulses generated by magnetic inductors are
      proposed to be synchronized with specific stimuli of the
      peripheral parts of the visual and auditory analyzers. The latter,
      as shown by experimental data, contributes to obtaining higher and
      more stable results in potentiating the professional abilities of
      biolocation operators (their intuition grows).<br>
      <br>
      The working hypothesis of the authors is the assumption, and later
      experimental confirmation, of the stimulating effect on the
      intuitive abilities of a person of the southern magnetic pole of
      the Earth’s magnetic field. This can be indirectly judged from
      literary data, since the maximum concentration of specially gifted
      people, such as Nobel laureates, is recorded in the immediate
      vicinity of the north pole of our planet, where the south magnetic
      pole is now located. Their almost complete absence is observed in
      the southern parts of America and Australia.<br>
      <br>
      It is known that intuition manages mainly the right hemisphere.
      The studies conducted by the authors convincingly showed that in
      the majority of the subjects, the impact of the southern magnetic
      pole on the left hemisphere suppresses the subjects' intuitive
      abilities, but stimulates logic, mathematical abilities. The
      effects of the north pole on the left hemisphere in most people
      (up to 72%) had virtually no effect on intuition, in 4.6% there
      was a slight decrease, and in the remaining part (23.4%) there was
      a slight stimulation effect.<br>
      <br>
      The results of the research conducted by the authors form the
      basis of the method for determining the optimal characteristics of
      the acting magnetic field. Moreover, the biolocation operators
      attracted to the work by the authors as an indicator in selecting
      the optimal magnetic field characteristics used the biotensor, an
      L-shaped biolocation frame, as an accessory.<br>
      <br>
      Information about special indicators-accessories (biotensors) used
      in the work of biolocation operators is described in detail in the
      specialized literature. So, it is known that biolocation studies
      are carried out using, for example, a forked wood branch, an
      L-shaped frame, a pendulum, etc. (Mizun Yu. G. Biopathogenic zones
      - the threat of diseases. M. 1993). The method of "dowsing" is
      known, which boils down to the fact that for some people, when
      passing them over aquifer, ore, or other abnormal zones, there is
      a deviation or rotation of an accessory sandwiched in the hand,
      for example, a branch of a forest hazelnut or willow. minerals. -
      Questions and Answers, 1973, N 3). According to some researchers,
      15 to 95% of the people surveyed have this ability. However, only
      gifted biolocation operators get good results after long and
      persistent training (NN Sochanovov, B.C. Matveev. Biophysical
      method in geological studies. - Geology of ore deposits. 1974,
      tons 16, N 5; Bakirov A. G. Geological possibilities of the
      biophysical method. - In the book: Collection of reports of the

      1970, vol. 372). Information about biolocational accessories

      <br>
      In international language, the term biotensor refers to a
      transducer of the researcher’s upper limbs invisible to the eye of
      the observer’s contractions to visible movement or other change of
      the initial state of the indicator used by the trigger system
      modeled by the biolocation operator in the YES-NO mode or
      according to the deviation angle of its working part.<br>
      <br>
      The invention consists in the following. The first step is to
      calibrate the generator of magnetic pulses with average values of
      magnetic induction, 50% of the duty cycle of the pulses, carrying
      a frequency of 440 Hz (beginning of the sound range), selecting
      the optimal interrupter frequency first for the right hemisphere
      and using only the southern inductor. Northern inductor at this
      stage of calibration is disabled.<br>
      <br>
      The authors found that the higher the magnitude of the magnetic
      induction, the more pronounced the positive effect. The maximum
      value is determined only by the design of the generator used, the
      magnetic inductors, the method of their fixation on the subject's
      head and his individual sensitivity to the action of the magnetic
      field.<br>
      <br>
      At the beginning of the work, the authors used a “Gradient” serial
      medical device for magnetic therapy, which has two magnetic
      inductors, which develop magnetic induction up to 50 mT. At
      present, the authors have the results of experiments with a new,
      more powerful generator of magnetic pulses of the AMIT-01 type,
      produced by VNIIFTRI, Moscow Region. For this device, the
      amplitude of the magnetic induction reaches up to 1200 mT with a
      depth of penetration into soft tissues up to 20 cm.<br>
      <br>
      To speed up the process of “generator calibration”, it turned out
      to be rational to use a step change in the interrupt frequency at
      a specified interval. The authors for technological reasons in the
      process of prospecting used the 1.0 Hz intervals for 10 values,
      followed by refining the optimal values with an accuracy of 0.1
      Hz, which significantly accelerated the "calibration" process. At
      the same time, the modulation "0" was estimated as a control study
      and in the application materials is considered from these
      positions.<br>
      <br>
      Similarly, the duty cycle of the generated pulse was selected with
      a step of 5% already at the interruption frequency found for the
      right hemisphere, the carrier frequency was adjusted with a step
      of 10 Hz and the magnitude of the magnetic induction with a step
      of 10 mTl.<br>
      <br>
      The next step was to connect the northern inductor to the left
      hemisphere with the right hemisphere inductor off and repeat the
      same sequence of actions as for the previous test.<br>
      <br>
      Experimental data obtained by the authors suggest that stimulation
      of only the right hemisphere by the south pole increases the
      intuitive perception of information to a greater extent than
      stimulation of only the left hemisphere by the northern magnetic
      inductor, and the inclusion of both inductors simultaneously with
      the selected characteristics gives the maximum effect, and the
      result significantly exceeds the mathematical sum of the expected
      increase in stability and increase in the degree of reliability of
      the results of the work of the biolok operators and grows in
      proportion to the detected beat of the resonant frequencies for
      both hemispheres and the maximum value for the right hemisphere.<br>
      <br>
      In other words, the dowsing operator with the selected frequencies
      of 8.2 Hz on the right and 6.4 Hz on the left is more “talented”
      with characteristics of 7.2 Hz and 6.8 Hz, respectively, which
      allowed the authors to classify dowsing operators according to
      professional suitability into various categories.<br>
      <br>
      In order to objectively monitor the magnitude of the reliability
      of the work performed as a biolocation operator and statistical
      processing of the results obtained, the subject was asked to
      identify one of three or five Zener mapscontaining various
      geometric shapes (square, triangle, cross, circle and two parallel
      lines). Each of the cards was previously placed in an envelope of
      thick non-transparent paper, and the envelopes were mixed in the
      absence of the subjects. This technique is known as the Wright
      test.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, technically the “calibration” process itself consists mainly
      in individual selection of the interruption frequency for a given
      inductors polarity according to the maximum biotrensor deviation
      separately for the right and left hemispheres, refinement of other
      magnetic impulse characteristics (duty cycle, carrier frequency
      and magnetic induction) and Wright test for selected parameters
      when both inductors are turned on simultaneously, despite the
      difference in the parameters selected for each channel separately.<br>
      <br>
      If the percentage of guessing did not exceed 70%, the operator was
      not allowed to the planned work.<br>
      <br>
      In their work, the authors used biolocation operators with skills
      to work as an accessory with an L-shaped biolocation frame
      complete with a color logarithmic scale as part of a circle with a
      total length of 21 cm, labeled from 0 to 7 conventional units (1 U
      = 3 cm) .<br>
      <br>
      In the works of Z. Garvalika (Harvalik Z.V., The American Dowser.
      1973. - V. 13. - N 3. - P. 85-95) it was found that an experienced
      biolocation operator reacts with varying degrees of sensitivity to
      polarized electromagnetic radiation, to alternating magnetic
      fields and a constant magnetic field, and the strongest reaction
      was observed when exposed to magnetic fields with the frequency of
      theta rhythm of the electrical activity of the brain in the range
      of 4-7 Hz. Moreover, the scientist set the frequency of the
      current in his experiments arbitrarily.<br>
      <br>
      According to the authors, the inventive method and device for its
      implementation allow the theolation operator to impose a theta
      rhythm on the brain and maximally use the paranormal properties of
      the brain, which stably manifest themselves in this state in the
      form of foresight and the ability to build reliable long-term
      forecasts.<br>
      This statement by the authors was confirmed in experiments on
      animals (rats).<br>
      <br>
      The essence of the experiments are presented below.<br>
      <br>
      The operator of biolocation after preliminary passing the test
      control according to the method described above begins to work in
      the mode with parameters of a pulsating magnetic field established
      for it with each animal and determines individual parameters of
      magnetic impulses for experimental rats separately. The brain of
      rats is treated with magnetic pulses with individually selected
      parameters for 10-15 minutes, after which the animals are briefly
      immersed in boiling water. There is no burn in animals, although
      in the control group (without magnetic stimulation) a burn was
      observed in all cases. Similar data are given by V.P. Lapshin in
      the description of the author's certificate for the invention
      (A.C. USSR N 602191, A 61 N 1/32, Byul. N 14 from 04.15.78) in
      animals after magnetic stimulation of the brain with a sinusoidal
      current with a frequency of 3-4 Hz.<br>
      <br>
      Stimulation of the brain with magnetic pulses with selected
      parameters apparently allows experimental animals to predict with
      high degree of accuracy the creation of an extreme situation
      planned by the researcher and somehow prepare in advance for the
      upcoming stress by preliminary (preventive in this case) release
      into the blood necessary for the body to survive in this situation
      , biologically active substances.<br>
      <br>
      The invention is confirmed by the following examples.<br>
      <br>
      The biolocation operator is offered to guess from 2 or 3 objects
      (drawings, diagrams, open cards, etc.) one that is obviously
      prepared for display, but hidden from visual recognition.<br>
      <br>
      The variant for the computer program had 2 open cards and one -
      closed, and it was necessary to guess it. The number of correct
      guesses was calculated.<br>
      <br>
      Studies were conducted on 256 volunteers - students of the Omsk
      Medical Academy and allowed to establish the average percentage of
      guessing 48%. In the group of certified dowsing operators, the
      average percentage of guessing was significantly higher - 62%.<br>
      <br>
      Using the proposed method and device for its implementation
      significantly increased the average percentage of guessing in the
      main group to 78%.<br>
      <br>
      For the experiments, the serial generator of magnetic pulses of
      the Gradient type was modified to separately adjust the parameters
      of the N - S channels and additionally supplied with two current
      interrupters in the circuit of magnetic inductors, and an
      interface was made with a computer control program.<br>
      <br>
      The material collected by the authors suggests that increasing the
      stability and increasing the degree of reliability of the results
      of the biolocation operators is facilitated by the impact on the
      right hemisphere of the S-magnetic inductor with the frequency and
      duty cycle parameters of the pulsating magnetic field found during
      test control.<br>
      <br>
      The authors revealed the effect of potentiation (aftereffect) of
      the developed equipment. Its essence lies in the experimentally
      confirmed ability of the biolocation operators to work more
      efficiently and reliably for a certain time when exposure to the
      magnetic field has already ceased.<br>
      <br>
      It has been established that high figures of confidence of the
      forecast are characteristic only for systems that tend to an
      unstable (metastable) state or destruction (death).<br>
      <br>
      The experiments confirming this statement were as follows. During
      the week, several animals (rats) were kept in separate cages with
      individual numbers. At the beginning of the experiment, the date
      and exact time of slaughter of each animal were planned, and the
      plan was recorded and documented with an accuracy of 10 minutes.<br>
      <br>
      The dowsing operator proposed using the inventive technology and
      equipment to determine the timing of the intended death of each
      animal. The forecast was built with the equipment turned off and
      with the selected optimal parameters of the magnetic field used.<br>
      <br>
      In another group of animals, the essence of the experiment was
      repeated, but the animals were not killed. The reliability of the
      forecasts in the first group was maximum.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, the inventive method and device were tested by the
      authors when conducting medical biolocation diagnosis in order to
      determine the possibility of verifying the diagnosis in patients
      with oncopathology, confirmed at the operation, and predicting
      their lifespan (cancer of the stomach, rectum, pancreas, lung and
      uterus).<br>
      <br>
      The inventive method and device can be used to increase stability
      and increase the degree of reliability of the results of the work
      of operators and other profiles, for example, in the army or
      aeroflot, especially when working in extreme situations.<br>

          FRAME&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</b><br>
      </div>
      Inventor: LUKOVNIKOV G S <br>
      <br>
      SUBSTANCE: concentrator has a system of substances, whose inner
      part is formed of substances in any state and any form, and which
      are surrounded by a substance in any state, made of a closed form
      and forming the outer part of the system. The inner and outer
      parts of the system by be connected by an electric circuit. The
      inner part of the system should be isolated from chemical
      interaction with the outer part. Due to the change of direction of
      movement of electric current in the concentrator components, field
      strengthening provides for its potentiation on human organism with
      the aim of treatment of many diseases. EFFECT: earthquake
      forecasting by behavior of concentrator.<br>
      <br>
      The invention relates to energy, in particular to bioenergy, and
      is intended for the concentration of the field, causing the
      rotation of the biolocation frame, for effects on the human body,
      on plant growth.<br>
      The invention has no analogues.<br>
      The technical result achieved by the invention is the possibility
      of artificial modeling of field emitters, causing the rotation of
      the biolocation frame.<br>
      <br>
      The invention consists in achieving the above mentioned technical
      result by a field concentrator causing rotation of the biolocation
      frame, containing solids made of any external form, forming the
      inner part of the concentrator system, surrounded by solid matter
      of the closed truss, forming the outer part of the concentrator
      system, while the mass of different substances of both parts hub
      may be the same.<br>
      <br>
      The field hub causing the biolocation frame to rotate, containing
      electrolyte tanks, which are located one inside the other with the
      formation of the inner and outer parts of the hub system, in the
      electrolytes of the inner and outer parts of the system there are
      electrodes connected by conductors to each other, with a mass of
      different substances from both parts of the hub may be the same.<br>
      <br>
      The field hub causing the biolocation frame to rotate, containing
      the inside of the hub system formed by the electrolyte tank,
      located inside the tank along its longitudinal axis of symmetry is
      a vertical rod extending outward to the top of the system a
      horizontal rod fixed on top of the vertical rod and made of the
      same material, and the outer part of the concentrator system,
      formed by the external electrolyte tank, the substances of the
      inner part have a balanced state with the substance In the other
      part of the system, the mass of different substances of both parts
      of the concentrator may be the same.<br>
      <br>
      The invention is illustrated by drawings, in which FIG. 1
      schematically shows a concentrator according to the first
      embodiment; FIG. 2 shows a hub according to the second embodiment;
      FIG. 3 - the hub on the third option.<br>
      <br>
      The hub in the first embodiment (Fig. 1) consists of a wooden rod
      1, located next to the bronze rod 2, forming the inner part of the
      hub. They are surrounded by a steel tube 3 having a closed
      external shape.<br>
      <br>
      The hub according to the second variant (Fig. 2) consists of a
      tank 4, in which electrodes 5, 6 are located, made, for example,
      from copper 5 and steel 6, and electrolyte 7 from a solution in
      salt water is located in the tank. The container 4 is located
      inside another container 8, inside which the lead electrode 9 and
      the aluminum electrode 10 are located, and the electrolyte 11 from
      a solution of drinking soda in water is also located.<br>
      <br>
      The electrodes of FIG. 2, 5, 6, 9, 10 can be closed by electric
      conductors 12, 13, 14, 15 in any sequence in any combination. When
      the electrodes 5, 6, 9, 10 are open, a field is formed around such
      a system, which can be detected by the biolocation method and
      causes the frames in the hands of the biolocator to rotate in one
      direction, either clockwise or counterclockwise. This will depend
      on the location of the containers 4, 8 with electrolytes 7, 11 and
      on the location of the electrodes 5, 6, 9, 10 in electrolytes 7,
      11 in one sequence or another.<br>
      <br>
      When electrodes 5, 6, 9, 10 are closed by electric conductors 12,
      13, 14, 15 in one sequence or another, and with any combination, a
      field will form around the proposed system, causing the frames to
      rotate clockwise or counterclockwise in the hands of the
      biolocator. , then causing crossbreeding of frames, then causing
      divorce of frames in different directions from each other.<br>
      <br>
      The same will happen if a constant electric current source 16 is
      connected to electrodes 5, 6, 9, 10 with the above combination of
      connecting electrodes 5, 6, 9, 10.<br>
      <br>
      When an alternating electric current source is connected to
      electrodes 5, 6, 9, 10 (not shown in Fig. 2), for any combination
      of connecting electrodes 5, 6, 9, 10, a field will form around the
      system, similar to the field with open electrodes 5, 6, 9, 10, but
      this field will be much more powerful, which is detected by the
      biolocation method and causes an increase in the frequency of
      rotation of the frames in the hands of the biolocator compared to
      when the electrodes 5, 6, 9, 10 are open.<br>
      <br>
      In this variant, a common field is detected in the concentrator
      system, which is detected by biolocation.<br>
      <br>
      The fields formed when the above combinations in the proposed
      device, differently and to varying degrees, affect the human body.<br>
      <br>
      The hub of the third option (Fig. 3) consists of a tank 17 with
      electrolyte 18 located inside the tank 17 along its longitudinal
      axis of the vertical metal rod 19, which comes out to the top of
      the system from a horizontal rod 20 mounted on top of the same
      material as vertical rod 19. These rods form the antenna of the
      inside. The inner part of the concentrator has a balanced state in
      the electrolyte 21 of the external tank 22, which forms the outer
      part of the system. The interior of the system acts as a float.<br>
      <br>
      By the biolocation method, it was established that the
      concentrator of FIG. 1 forms a hemispherical field from the middle
      of the longitudinal axis of the steel tube and upwards, causing
      the frames in the hands of the biolocator to rotate clockwise
      (positive field). Down from the middle of the longitudinal axis of
      the steel outer tube, a hemispherical electric field is formed,
      causing the frames in the hands of the biolocator to rotate
      counterclockwise (the field is negative in polarity).<br>
      <br>
      The electric field concentrator system only works if the internal
      part of substances in any form and in any form is surrounded by
      substance in any form made in a closed form, if the external part
      of the concentrator is open-circuited, then such a concentrator
      will not form a field.<br>
      <br>
      Of the many experiments it was found that substances in any state
      (liquid and gaseous), but enclosed inside substances that form
      their external form, when the above described conditions for field
      concentration, also form a common field, while internal substances
      differ from external ones by total charges or the total electrical
      value of the charges of their constituent atoms.<br>
      <br>
      Likewise, fields of completely spherical shape and only one
      polarity can be obtained.<br>
      <br>
      The fields formed by the proposed concentrators interact with each
      other and / or neutralize each other, or form a common field of a
      certain polarity, but of greater force.<br>
      <br>
      Field hubs have a positive effect on the human body, contributing
      to its recovery in many diseases. It depends on the quality and
      parameters of the manufactured hub. Hubs should be used by a
      specialist in this field.<br>
      <br>
      Field hubs also affect plant growth, neutralize geopathic zones,
      which is important for the environment, increase the human
      biofield 2.5 times or more.<br>
      <br>
      There are natural formations. For example, an underground water
      lake or a river is surrounded by solid rock on the surface of the
      globe, in this place a pathogenic zone is formed and is detected
      by the biolocation method, frames in the hands of the biolocator.<br>
      <br>
      If we take two electrodes, place one inside the other, but the
      external electrode must be of a closed form, then an electric
      field is formed around these electrodes, which is detected by the
      biolocation method.<br>
      <br>
      If electrolytes from the same substances, but different in mass or
      electrolytes from different substances are placed, for example, in
      glass containers separately and one container with one electrolyte
      is placed inside another container with another electrolyte, an
      external electric field is formed around this system detectable
      biolocation method.<br>
      <br>
      The same thing happens with gaseous substances.<br>
      <br>
      Hubs can predict an earthquake.<br>
      <br>
      Fields with properties that differ from the known electric fields
      have a significant effect on the human body, on plant growth. As a
      result, it became possible to artificially simulate field emitters
      that exist naturally in nature and are detectable by a biolocation
      method, and to vary them in any direction. <br>

        <b> METHOD OF REGISTRATION OF PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF
          GEOPATHOGENIC ZONE IN TERRESTRIAL RADIATION</b><br>
      </div>
      Inventor: IVANOV-KHOLODNYJ G S &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      SUBSTANCE: there is considered as prototype known biolocation
      method by which man with frame or pendulum in hands registers
      geopathogenic zones. Main drawback of method lies in its
      subjectivity. There exist more objective methods using effects in
      organic material and geophysical measurements but they are not
      versatile and registration results are not stable. Proposed method
      is based or registration of stable frequency of oscillations of
      autonomous oscillatory system which is observed depending on
      presence of system within geopathogenic zone or outside of it.
      Realization of method was demonstrated by use of astronomical
      clock with equalizing beam as well as of pendulum and quartz
      autonomous oscillatory systems. It is found that value and sign of
      change of frequency of oscillations depend both on type of sensor
      and on type analyzed geopathogenic zone. Effect of difference of
      frequency within geopathogenic zone and outside of it for each
      type of sensor has stable character. EFFECT: improved authenticity
      of method.<br>
      <br>
      The invention relates to the fields of geophysics, biology,
      ecology and medicine associated with the study of terrestrial
      radiation, including geopathic zones.<br>
      <br>
      There are known methods for determining the presence or absence of
      a geopathic zone by changing the electrical properties of blood in
      test tubes or by changing the color of an organic dye introduced
      into a geopathic zone (GB).<br>
      <br>
      There are also known methods for registering the presence or
      absence of a geopathic zone based on measuring various geophysical
      parameters of the environment: the geomagnetic field strength
      (GMF), the level of gamma; -radiation, etc. [1, p.26] These
      methods of recording the presence or absence of GB, based on the
      analysis of the effects of GB in organic materials and
      measurements of natural geophysical fields, however, are not
      universal, and the results of recording are unstable, therefore
      biolocation is usually used way to.<br>
      <br>
      For the prototype, the most common biolocation method of detecting
      the presence or absence of GZ in terrestrial radiation was chosen.
      The known method [1, pp.43-51] is based on the detection of
      differences in a stable reaction in a person with an indicator
      (frame, vine, pendulum) depending on whether he is in or outside
      the GB and which, in the presence of GB, is identified by the
      position deviation indicator taken from the normal position, which
      he has outside the GZ. In this case, the person himself serves as
      the sensor, and his reaction to the GB is identified by the
      indicator deviation.<br>
      <br>
      This method of biolocation registration includes as a necessary
      element the participation of the person himself in the
      registration process, and in this sense it is subjective. The
      results of registration may depend on the ability of the
      individual and in each case on the state of his health and mood
      [2] The technical task to be accomplished is to give the
      registration process an objective character, allowing for the
      sustainable registration of the GB autonomously, without human
      intervention.<br>
      <br>
      The task is solved by the fact that when registering the presence
      or absence of a GZ, it is not the reaction of a traditional
      framework, a rod or pendulums in the hands of a person that is
      analyzed, but a change in such a physical parameter of an
      autonomous oscillating system as the oscillation frequency, the
      change of which determines the presence or absence of GZ.<br>
      <br>
      The reaction of autonomous oscillatory systems to their position
      relative to the Hartmann grid was discovered. In particular,
      pendulum and balance oscillatory systems were investigated. The
      oscillatory systems used made it possible to detect that a
      physical parameter, such as the oscillation frequency, depends on
      whether the system is located on the bands, on the nodes, i.e. at
      the intersection of the strips of the Hartmann grid, or outside
      them.<br>
      <br>
      Registration of the presence or absence of GZ using an autonomous
      oscillating system can be implemented by using such a well-known
      means as stable clock mechanisms, for example, an astronomical
      clock of the Marine Chronometer system using the well-known
      accurate time measurement technique used by astronomers and
      meeting the necessary conditions for reliable measurement in
      particular, taking into account the natural course of the clock,
      its temperature factor, etc. The time of the clock is the change
      for a certain period of time (hour, day) the correction of the
      clock readings relative to the exact time. In this case, there is
      a difference in the stable response of the oscillation frequency
      or the course of the clock, depending on whether they are located
      in or outside the GB, and which, in the presence of a GB, is
      identified by a change in the oscillation frequency of the
      autonomous balancing oscillatory system.<br>
      <br>
      Numerous measurements of the course of hours were carried out in
      the presence and absence of GB, while during the observation
      period from 1991 to the present, various clock systems were used
      and different GBs were analyzed. When observing the rules of the
      method of measuring time with the same sample of clocks and for
      the same GB, there was always a steady repetitive effect.<br>
      <br>
      It was found that the magnitude and sign of the effect depend on
      both the sample of the clock used and the type of GB analyzed. The
      difference in the course, for example, “Marine Chronometer” in the
      GZ and outside the zone by changing the oscillation frequency for
      typical cases lies in the range of 10-25%, which is an order of
      magnitude greater than the error of the measurements taken and
      confirms the reliability of the results.<br>
      <br>
      Similarly, the difference in the frequency of oscillations in the
      GB and outside it was observed in such autonomous oscillatory
      systems, such as a pendulum clock and a quartz clock, which
      confirms the generality of the conclusions obtained with the
      balanced oscillatory systems.<br>
      <br>
      The application of the proposed method of recording the presence
      or absence of GZ in the Hartmann grid will release the most
      valuable information about GZ from observations from the currently
      available elements of mistrust caused by the subjectivity of the
      method used to obtain it, and will allow the development of
      indicators and sensors on a new basis allowing physical
      measurements, thereby increasing the reliability of the research,
      and in the future will provide an opportunity to develop the
      equipment necessary for automated and and sounding sounding
      systems, for areal and operational methods for diagnosing health
      problems, for carrying out experimental studies to establish the
      nature of the earth’s radiation and dry earth.<br>

      FIELD: industries engaged in operation of underground service
      lines of city municipal utilities. SUBSTANCE: physico-geological
      base of method is dependence of intensity of magnetic field and
      gravity force observed on the earth surface, on degree of
      magnetization and excessive density of underground service lines
      with consideration of anomaly (with use of their characteristics)
      of magnetic and gravitational fields produced by the body of
      operators the field survey. In this case, noted is only horizontal
      components of these anomalies in form of gradients of horizontal
      fields, mainly, with analysis of noted directions of gradients.
      Apparatuses used for the purpose are of ground field type.
      Principle of operation of apparatuses is based on use of property
      of freely secured load from diamagnetic or paramagnetic material
      to be attracted to the side of decreased or increased values of
      magnetic field. In this case, load may be of spherical shape
      (pendulum version), or in form of horizontal rod capable of free
      rotation round vertical axis running, either, through center of
      gravity, or through one of its ends. Rod may be combined with
      central part of magnetically neutral material (rocker) and with
      counterbalanced end parts from material with different sign of
      coefficient of magnetic susceptibility (paramagnetic or
      diamagnetic material), end parts may be spherical in shape.
      Parameter to be measured is azimuth of gradient of horizontal
      magnetic and gravitational fields. Indication record is of visual
      type. Category of accuracy is mean. EFFECT: higher efficiency.<br>
      <br>
      The invention relates to the section of geophysics engaged in
      micromagnetic and microgravity exploration, and can be used in the
      oil and gas industry, as well as in utilities to determine the
      coordinates and condition of the elements of the underground
      transport communications.<br>
      <br>
      There is a method of joint interpretation of magnetometric and
      gravimetric data, when magnetometric data are considered together
      with gravimetric data due to the great generality of the theory of
      magnetic and gravitational fields. Pseudo-gravitational anomalies
      are calculated, representing vertical derivatives of the
      gravitational potential, calculated on the basis of the Poisson
      ratio from the distribution of the magnetic field (Z or ?T) on the
      measurement plane.<br>
      <br>
      Pseudo-magnetic anomalies are derivatives of the magnetic
      potential, calculated on the same basis from the distribution of
      the gravitational field.<br>
      <br>
      Comparison of pseudo-gravitational and pseudo-magnetic anomalies
      with the corresponding observed fields allows us to more
      accurately determine the nature of the perturbing objects.<br>
      <br>
      If pseudo-anomalies and real anomalies coincide, then the magnetic
      and gravitational fields are due to the same reasons.<br>
      <br>
      The disadvantage of this method is the great complexity in the
      collection of field data and the mathematical processing of the
      results, as well as the low efficiency in determining the
      coordinates of objects with previously known shape, size and
      physical properties.<br>
      <br>
      There is a method of "biophysical effect" (Copyright certificate
      805224 1981, G 01 V 3/00), in which the planned contours of the
      searched underground object are determined during a pedestrian
      geophysical survey of the angle of rotation in one or two hands of
      an operator of a freshly cut wooden branch or horizontal metal
      framework.<br>
      <br>
      The unit of measurement for the movement of the operator in the
      area under study is taken as the number of steps for one rotation
      of the frame or a period of time per revolution (when driving in
      transport).<br>
      <br>
      At the same time, points and lines of change of the rotation sign
      of the frame are fixed and maps of the BLE isolines are drawn up,
      and the coordinates and dimensions of the underlying object are
      determined from them.<br>
      <br>
      The disadvantage of this method is the impossibility of detailed
      localization of objects of relatively small size and uncertainty
      in interpreting the nature of the physical processes underlying
      the "biophysical effect", as well as the lack of data on the angle
      of rotation of the frame, obtained when the operator is stationary
      relative to a point on the ground.<br>
      <br>
      To determine the direction of the gradient of the horizontal
      component of the magnetic field, you can also use a C-15
      magnetometer on a quartz suspension, designed for high-precision
      measurements of the horizontal component H of the earth — the
      earth's magnetic field and magnetic declination D.<br>
      <br>
      The sensitive part is a permanent magnet, freely suspended in a
      horizontal position on a vertical quartz filament.<br>
      <br>
      The absolute value of the horizontal component of the earth's
      magnetic field is determined by twisting the quartz thread with
      the magnet first in one direction, then the other, and comparing
      the angles of deviation of the magnet from the plane of the
      magnetic meridian (the position of free equilibrium with the
      untwisted thread).<br>
      <br>
      The disadvantage of this device is the large labor input in
      collecting field data and their mathematical processing to obtain
      a planned picture of the horizontal magnetic field gradient, low
      efficiency and the impossibility of parallel fixing the direction
      of the gradient of the horizontal component of the gravity field
      by the same device.<br>
      <br>
      Gravitational variometers and gradiometers, such as the gravity
      horizontal gradient meter Vxz, or the GRBM-2 gradiometer, are used
      to measure second derivatives of gravity.<br>
      <br>
      In a gravitational variometer, the equilibrium positions (ni) of
      torsion systems are recorded at several orientations of the
      device. From the measured values (ni), the second derivatives are
      calculated by formulas expressing the relationship between the
      field of gravity, the parameters of the device and its orientation
      in space.<br>
      <br>
      The disadvantage of this device is the large labor input in
      collecting field data and their mathematical processing to obtain
      a planned picture of the gradient of the horizontal gravitational
      field, low efficiency and the impossibility of parallel fixing the
      direction of the gradient of the horizontal component of the
      Earth’s magnetic field.<br>
      <br>
      The closest in technical essence is a device for geomagnetic
      intelligence (Copyright certificate N 805224, 1981, G 01 V 3/00),
      which is a frame held in the hands of the operator, with copper
      and steel lateral sides closed between themselves through
      settings. With the help of the frame, when the operator moves, the
      number of steps per turn is counted, and the turn is considered to
      be the transition of the frame from the upper oblique position to
      the lower one, and the return to the initial position is performed
      by the operator each time.<br>
      <br>
      The disadvantage of the device is the inability to separately
      account for factors affecting the readings of the device, such as
      the full vector of both the magnetic and gravitational fields of
      the Earth and the operator, the electromagnetic non-stationary
      emissions of the tuning loop and the need often leads the device
      to its original state, which leads to an increase in the
      subjective factor in the results measurements, and the operator
      requires specific techniques and skills that prevent the
      widespread use of the device.<br>
      <br>
      The technical result of the invention is to simplify the device
      for simultaneous fixation of the azimuths of the gradients of the
      horizontal magnetic and gravitational fields with the separation
      of the factors of the operator and the external field, increasing
      the information content and convenience in using the device.<br>
      <br>
      The technical result is achieved by the fact that the sensitive
      part of the proposed device responds both to the gradients of the
      horizontal magnetic field and to the gradients of the horizontal
      gravitational field.<br>
      <br>
      A device for geomagnetic intelligence consists of a horizontal
      rocker with two balancing weights at the ends, suspended on a thin
      inextensible thread, and the weights are made of magnets with
      opposite signs of the magnetic susceptibility coefficient.<br>
      <br>
      According to the nature of the distribution of the magnitude and
      sign of the azimuth of the gradient relative to the direction of
      the path, the planned coordinates of the characteristic points of
      magnetic and gravitational anomalies are determined, and the
      planned coordinates of the vector field of these gradients
      determine the communication coordinates, the direction of movement
      of the transported medium and the coordinates of hidden accidents.<br>

      <br>
      The physical properties of the underground transport communication
      differ sharply from the physical properties of the surrounding
      medium (specific density, ability to magnetize in the Earth’s
      magnetic field), and the communication itself can be defined as a
      cylinder of infinite stretch in the first approximation.<br>
      <br>
      Typically, the depth of communication is from one (cables,
      heating) to four (water, oil) meters, and the lost covers of wells
      lie at a depth of no more than half a meter.<br>
      <br>
      These factors cause sharp anomalies of the magnetic and
      gravitational fields to appear over communication, and the planned
      coordinates of such objects are best depicted in the planned
      patterns of the gradients of the horizontal components of the
      magnetic and gravitational anomalies, and the higher the order of
      the derivative field being analyzed, the sharper contours of the
      underground object appear. , and the greater the depth of the
      object, the greater the size of the “appearing” contour and the
      more blurred its boundaries become.<br>
      <br>
      Due to the fact that the sources of magnetic and gravitational
      anomalies are the same object, it can be assumed that the graphs
      of the distribution of anomalies of horizontal magnetic (Ha) and
      horizontal gravitational (Ga) fields across the strike of
      communication (Fig. 1) repeat each other in shape, differing only
      the scale of the values of the functions for the same value of the
      argument (coordinates of the area). In this case, Ha = 1 / G d · J
      · Vxz, where G is the gravitational constant, d - cylinder
      specific density, J - cylinder magnetization in the external
      magnetic field of the Earth, Ha - the magnitude of the anomaly of
      the horizontal component of the magnetic field, Vxz - the
      magnitude of the anomaly of the horizontal component of the
      gravity field.<br>
      <br>
      Characteristic points are those points on the terrain where
      anomalies reach maximum values (+ X extr) or change their sign (X
      = o).<br>
      <br>
      With vertical magnetization and with the strike axis Y directed to
      the north, the depth h is defined as the graph of the first
      derivative of the horizontal field (Hagr, Gagr) is shown in the
      same FIG. 1, and the derivative is taken from the distance X in
      this case, where Hagr is the gradient of the horizontal magnetic
      field; Gagr is the gradient of the horizontal gravitational field.<br>
      <br>
      From FIG. 1 it can be seen that tensions are directed towards
      communication, with a change of direction to the opposite at the
      point X = 0.<br>
      <br>
      The gradients change their direction three times: at X = -X Ext X
      = O and X = + X Extra, the extremum line (maximum) repeats the
      shape of the cover above the metal well cover and the gradients
      change their sign only once when approaching it from either side
      (Fig.2)<br>
      <br>
      If the transported medium (water, oil, electric current) does not
      move, the lines of action of the strength vectors and their
      gradients are perpendicular to the planned projection of the axis
      of the communication stretch (FIG. 1).<br>
      <br>
      If the communication is in working condition, the lines of the
      vector field are bent in the direction of movement of the
      transported medium, and the more steeper, the greater the speed of
      the flow (Fig. 3), and at the site of damage the field pattern
      becomes less ordered and even changes in time becoming
      non-stationary due to fluctuations arising from the damage site of
      the transported medium both in magnitude and in direction.<br>
      <br>
      If the device for fixing the directions of the gradients is in the
      hands of the operator or in the immediate vicinity of him, then it
      is necessary to take into account the gradients of the magnetic
      and gravitational fields, due to the presence of the operator of
      both magnetic and inert (gravitational) mass.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, when determining the depth of occurrence, the
      distance between the device in the hands and the surface of the
      Earth must be taken into account. Typically, the device is at the
      level of the solar plexus at a distance from the operator’s body
      equal to the length of the forearm (r0), with the shoulders freely
      lowered. Hands at the same time are on the left and right side of
      the longitudinal axis of the operator.<br>
      <br>
      The magnetic fields of a living organism can be caused by three
      reasons.<br>
      <br>
      First of all, these are biocurrents (moving ions and radicals)
      arising from the electrical activity of tape membranes, mainly
      such cells as muscle and nerve.<br>
      <br>
      Another source is the smallest highly magnetic (ferromagnetic)
      particles trapped in the body. In an adult, the total iron content
      in the body reaches 4 to 5 grams.<br>
      <br>
      These two sources create their own magnetic field.<br>
      <br>
      The third source is the heterogeneity of the magnetic
      susceptibility of various organs, which manifest themselves only
      when external magnetic fields are applied.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. Figure 4 shows the planned pattern of operator gradients in
      the left (A) and right (B) areas where the brushes are located.
      The external field is assumed to be uniform and stationary
      (timeless). The operator gradient (Hogr, Gogr) is the vector sum
      of the body gradient (Htgr, Gtgr) and the hand gradient (Hpgr,
      Gpgr). The gradients are directed towards the perturbing object
      (operator), and the action lines of the gradients l0 make up some
      initial angle a 0 with direction the proposed move operator X.<br>
      <br>
      If the gradients of the vernal field (Hagr, Gagr) are directed
      "from the operator" (Fig. 5), then the total gradient (Hgr, Ggr)
      acts along the line l, which has been turned by the angle a of the
      nar with respect to the direction l0.<br>
      If the gradients of the external field are directed toward the
      operator, then the lines of the gradients l0 are rotated in the
      left and right brushes by the angle a nn “inward” (Fig. 6).<br>
      <br>
      Usually, the operator must orient the direction of X by rotating
      the body in one direction or another, so that the angles of a A
      and a B in the left and right hands are equal. Then the lines of
      action of the external gradients will be parallel to the X line,
      and the direction of the external gradients will be determined by
      the nature of the rotation of the line of the total gradients on
      the left and right sides "outward" or "inward."<br>
      <br>
      Thus, when the operator follows the communication strike along the
      X axis (Fig. 1), the gradient lines of the total field la and lb
      will rotate outward or inward depending on the direction of the
      external field gradients, which allows determining the coordinates
      of the characteristic points of the anomaly on the left and to the
      right of the strike axis of communication.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 7, and a graph of the distribution of the a value is
      presented. depending on the coordinates of the operator on the
      profile section of the communication, while at turns "outwards"
      the angle a? It is considered positive, and "inside" - negative.<br>
      <br>
      This graph of a = &amp; phiv; (x) repeats in shape and in
      coordinates of characteristic points the graph of the gradient of
      the horizontal field in FIG. 1.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 7, b shows schematically the planned fragments of the
      directions of the line la and lb in separate points of the path of
      the operator from left to right at his stops.<br>
      <br>
      By marking the points where la (lb) coincide with l0, one can
      determine the coordinates of the characteristic points of the
      anomalies.<br>
      <br>
      If the operator explores the terrain in continuous motion with a
      following speed V0, then the line l will perform circular
      oscillations around the point A (B) in the operator’s hand with an
      angular velocity ?, proportional to both the gradient (the rate of
      change of a along the X axis) and the speed its movement At the
      characteristic points of the profile section the angle of rotation
      "outward" or "inward" reaches its extreme values with a change in
      the direction of rotation to the opposite, but the coordinates of
      such "extreme" position of the line l will be equal to X = ± 0.5 X<br>
      <br>
      The rotational speed (angular) of the line l (&amp; omega;) will
      be maximum at the points with the coordinates X = + X Extra, X =
      -X Extra and X = 0.<br>
      <br>
      This speed is actually proportional to the gradient of the
      gradient of the horizontal magnetic and gravitational fields,
      being a higher (by an order) derivative of the potential than the
      gradient of the horizontal component of the magnetic
      (gravitational) field.<br>
      <br>
      The method allows to more quickly determine the coordinates of the
      underground transport communications and its state, more clearly
      outline its planned contours through the use of higher derivatives
      of the anomalous magnetic and gravitational fields, multiplied by
      the effect of jointly accounting for magnetic and gravitational
      anomalies.<br>
      <br>
      For measurements, a device can be used, in which the sensitive
      organ is a horizontal rod made of a magnetically soft ferromagnet,
      which can freely rotate around one of its ends, hinged at the top
      of a vertical handle (FIG. 8).<br>
      The length of the rod lst = 200 - 300 mm, and the diameter dst = 2
      - 3 mm.<br>
      the rod can be made of &amp; mu; - iron with a magnetic
      susceptibility coefficient &amp; chi; = UP TO 10,000 * 10-5 and
      with a coercive force Hc approximately equal to zero.<br>
      <br>
      The handle held in the hands of the operator (left, right) is made
      of magnetic (?? = 0) magnetic material that does not conduct
      electricity, for example, from dry wood.<br>
      <br>
      The bearing unit, which provides the ability to rotate the rod in
      the horizontal plane, consists of two rolling bearings (ball
      bearings) with an outer diameter of 7 mm and an internal diameter
      of 2 mm. The height of the bearing assembly is 15-20 mm.<br>
      <br>
      Instead of ball bearings, fluoroplastic-based bearings can be
      used, but then the sensitivity of the device will be somewhat
      less.<br>
      <br>
      In a non-uniform magnetic field, forces will act on the rod,
      tending to establish it both along the magnetic field line and in
      the direction of the gradient of the horizontal magnetic field.<br>
      <br>
      The rod is attracted to the region of increased values of the
      horizontal magnetic field (H) with a force proportional to the rod
      volume, magnetic susceptibility and the gradient of the horizontal
      magnetic field. For &amp; mu; - iron &amp; chi; has the highest
      value among ferromagnets, so a noticeable moment will appear,
      setting the rod with a free end in the direction of the magnetic
      field gradient (MgrH).<br>
      <br>
      Due to the rod’s own inertial mass (gravitational mass), it is
      acted upon by a force in the direction of the horizontal intensity
      of the gravitational field, in proportion to its magnitude.<br>
      <br>
      As a result, a moment (MG) appears, setting the rod along a
      longitudinal axis along the line of the horizontal component of
      the gravity field.<br>
      <br>
      In the plots of moments as a function of the azimuth of the free
      end relative to the line of intensities and their gradients in
      FIG. 9 for coinciding directions of strengths and gradients, and
      in FIG. 10 for the opposite, it can be noted that in either case
      the rod is installed with a free end along the direction of the
      gradients of the horizontal magnetic and gravitational fields
      acting in concert due to the fact that the source of both magnetic
      and gravitational anomalies is the same object.<br>
      <br>
      The total orienting moment in FIG. 9 leads to the fact that the
      free end is set in the direction of 0 ° (360 °), and in FIG. 10 -
      in the direction of 180o.<br>
      <br>
      When field shooting across the communication strike, it is easiest
      to use two devices at once, holding one device in the left and the
      other in the right hand to mark the directions of the gradients
      (FIG.<br>
      <br>
      4) In a uniform and stationary field, the rods will settle along
      the line l0. When following across the strike axis along the X
      axis, the rods "diverge" (Fig. 5) or "converge" (Fig. 6), being
      established along the line la, lb, which is noted visually by the
      operator.<br>
      <br>
      The rods can be installed either "from oneself" or "towards
      oneself" by tilting the handle. The sensitivity of the device can
      be adjusted by changing the angle of inclination. With the handle
      in the vertical position, the sensitivity is maximum. With
      sufficient training, you can use one device, holding it in the
      "working" hand, as more sensitive. For most men, the “working”
      hand is the right hand, for women it is the left one. When working
      with two devices, the rod in the “working” hand usually responds
      first to changes in the magnitude and direction of the gradients
      (more mobile).<br>
      <br>
      The adjusting (orienting) moments are comparatively small in
      magnitude, and may be less than the frictional moment of rest in
      the bearing assembly of the hinge in the handle. Therefore, the
      "jams" of the rod in intermediate positions are possible if, for
      example, the handle is fixed on the ground even strictly
      vertically.<br>
      <br>
      The operator’s hand, together with the handle, makes imperceptible
      oscillations with a certain periodicity in all three planes, which
      leads to periodically recurring positions of the rod zero-gravity,
      when even small efforts from the anomaly of the external field may
      not gradually, but turn the rod in the direction of the sources of
      these anomalies. Therefore, when fixing the azimuths of the
      gradient at a particular point in the terrain, it is necessary to
      sustain a certain period of time from the beginning to the end of
      the measurement, keeping the devices in the working position.<br>
      <br>
      When the operator follows the route in continuous mode with speed
      V0 (Fig. 7), dynamic moments appear due to the presence of the rod
      inertia moment relative to the vertical axis of rotation, which
      may be greater than the moments of friction of motion (smaller in
      magnitude than the moments of friction of rest) bearing unit.<br>
      <br>
      Considering these features, the operator must adjust the speed of
      his movement so as not to “slip” the coordinates of the
      characteristic points of the anomaly, and if necessary,
      investigate the “suspicious” place with a different speed and in
      the opposite direction.<br>
      <br>
      In order to get rid of bending efforts in the bearing unit as much
      as possible and to increase the sensitivity of the device by
      keeping the handle strictly vertical, another balancing rod made
      of a diamagnet (for example, copper) of approximately the same
      length is installed in the rod attachment unit, the longitudinal
      axes rods of magnetically soft ferromagnet and diamagnetic
      coincide (Fig. 11, a), and between the rods there is a short beam
      of non-conductive magnetoneutral material so that, if possible,
      and disconnect the electrical and magnetic coupling between the
      rods.<br>
      <br>
      The plots of the establishing moments for the coinciding
      directions of the intensities and their gradients are shown in
      FIG. 12, and for the opposite, in FIG. 13.<br>
      <br>
      For such a device, the gradient of the horizontal gravitational
      field (MgrH) plays a significant role, establishing a composite
      rod along the line of action of this gradient (Fig. 12, d, 13, d).<br>
      <br>
      The presence of friction at rest in the bearing assembly can also
      lead to the rod getting stuck in an intermediate position when
      trying to fix the azimuth of the gradient when the vertical handle
      is fixed at the measuring point, although this lack of wealth can
      also be compensated for by adjusting the speed of the device
      moving along the route under study.<br>
      <br>
      It is possible to get rid of friction when turning the rod, if the
      rod is suspended at the center of gravity with the help of a thin
      inextensible thread (Fig. 11, b). The suspension is carried out on
      a half-wire of a magnetic-neutral material so that the rod can
      make a full turn in the horizontal plane. The semi-arc is fixed on
      a light round base of neutral material so that the projection of
      the suspension thread on the horizontal plane coincides with the
      center of the base, graduated in degrees to fix the angle of
      rotation of the rod relative to the position of free equilibrium
      with the untwisted thread. Such a position of the rod with the
      fixation of the zero mark on the base is determined in a uniform
      and stationary magnetic and gravitational field.<br>
      <br>
      The device can be installed on the surface of the investigated
      area of space, the dimensions of which are determined by the
      dimensions of the composite rod, in the working position. After
      that, the base is turned in the direction to which the rod is
      rotated under the action of anomalies of the enclosing space until
      the rod stops. There can be several such positions of stability,
      therefore it is necessary to trace these positions by turning the
      base 360 degrees. One of the most stable positions can be taken as
      the initial one, and, while maintaining the orientation of the
      base with a half-arc constant, it is possible to obtain the
      deviation angles of the rod from zero at various points of the
      terrain.<br>
      <br>
      The device is very sensitive, therefore, until the end of the
      measurements, the operator must maintain the same position with
      respect to the device, and even the same mood of the benevolent
      researcher.<br>
      <br>
      In order to isolate the line of action of the horizontal magnetic
      field, a ferromagnetic rod can be hung, which rotates along the
      magnetic field line (FIG. 14). The horizontal rod of a diamagnetic
      (copper) will rotate perpendicular to the magnetic field line
      (Fig. 15). The core of the magnetic material will rotate along the
      line of the horizontal gravitational field (FIG. 16).<br>
      <br>
      Two balanced spherical loads, freely suspended on a horizontal
      light beam, will indicate the direction of the gradient of the
      horizontal magnetic field and the gradient line of the horizontal
      gravitational field if one load is made of a soft magnetic
      ferromagnet and the other is of a diamagnetic (Fig. 11c). A graph
      of orienting points for such a device is shown in FIG. 17.<br>
      <br>
      In the state of free equilibrium, the ferromagnetic weight will be
      established in the direction of the gradient of the horizontal
      magnetic field.<br>
      <br>
      A freely suspended pendulum weight from a magnetically soft
      ferromagnet (FIG. 11, d) can also serve to determine the azimuth
      of the line of action of horizontal tension and its gradient (FIG.
      18).<br>
      <br>
      If the pendulum is deflected from the equilibrium position to
      position 1 and released, then in a uniform and stationary field it
      will swing in a vertical plane passing through point 1 and
      equilibrium position 0.<br>
      <br>
      In a non-uniform magnetic and gravitational field, the pendulum
      will describe in space a complex trajectory, the planned
      projection of which is close to an ellipsoid with a major axis,
      gradually turning to coincide with the direction of the horizontal
      strengths of the magnetic and gravitational fields and their
      gradients. After some time, the pendulum will begin to describe
      the trajectory of the ellipse with an increased ratio of the major
      axis to the minor axis and with a decrease in the length of the
      largest axis of this ellipse.<br>
      <br>
      In the end, the planned trajectory of the movement of the pendulum
      cargo will turn into a straight line, coinciding with the lines of
      action of tensions and gradients.<br>
      <br>
      The nature of the entrance to the final position (the speed of
      rotation of the major axis of the ellipse, the change in the shape
      of the ellipse with time, the direction of rotation of the weight
      around the vertical axis of the thread suspension) depends on
      whether the directions of the strengths coincide with their
      gradients or not, and on the nature of the distribution of field
      values weights trajectory space.<br>
      <br>
      Without waiting until the movement of the weight stabilizes, you
      can stop the weight, turn the pedestal with the suspension to the
      corresponding angle in the horizontal plane and “swing” the
      pendulum again. Such manipulations should be carried out until the
      released pendulum starts to swing for quite a long time in a
      vertical plane passing through the lower equilibrium position with
      the planned trajectory of movement in the form of a line
      indicating the line of action of the corresponding horizontal
      gradients.<br>
      <br>
      Subsequent measurements can be carried out at other points in the
      terrain, while maintaining the fixed bearing azimuth relative to
      the north direction, while noting new gradient directions.<br>
      <br>
      The weigher can be made of magnetic material with a view to fixing
      the azimuths of gravity anomalies.<br>
      <br>
      With appropriate skills, the operator can hold the pendulum for
      the suspension string in his hand (left, right or in each),
      conducting operational research both on the move and in a
      stationary state, but now taking into account his own magnetic and
      gravitational radiations.<br>
      <br>
      When working with one pendulum, it is desirable to hold it in the
      "working" hand.<br>
      <br>
      The proposed devices are simple in design, allow you to quickly
      determine the direction of the horizontal gradients of the
      magnetic field and the gravitational field in the studied area of
      space, both when the device is continuously moving by the operator
      and in a static position. <br>

      switching time of the radio signal source, such as ships, wrecks,
      submarines, etc., uses the participation of two radiostatic
