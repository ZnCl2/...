      <div align="center"><big><b>Electronic wedge brakes stop in half
            the distance</b></big><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Efforts to improve the efficiency of braking systems have led to
      some interesting innovations in recent years, including the use of
      ceramic carbon materials in brake discs and electronic activation
      of parking brakes. But those developments will seem minor compared
      to the leap Siemens is claiming for its new electronic wedge
      brake. The idea behind the system is not exactly new, with
      similarities to the arrangement found on horse-drawn carriages
      from the 18th century, where a wedge was used to bring the wheel
      to a standstill. But rather than relying on a hardened piece of
      wood for a binder, the electronic wedge uses state-of-the-art
      electronics and an innovative wedge-shaped connection to provide
      the sort of stopping ability that existing hydraulic units cannot
      match. Unlike today’s traditional hydraulic brake, which requires
      the buildup of forces before the caliper is able to grip the disc,
      the electronic wedge brake uses a series of interlocking
      triangular teeth that offset between the caliper and the disc. In
      all, it is claimed to require just one-tenth the energy used by
      hydraulic braking. A small electric motor pushes the pad toward
      the rotor by a lateral movement-much like how a watermelon seed
      can be ejected at high velocity by squishing it between your
      fingers. The entire system runs on the standard 12-volt electrical
      system found in most cars. Really clever, however, is that the
      kinetic energy of the car automatically increases the braking
      performance. In theory, the faster you are traveling when the
      brakes are applied, the more powerful they become. When the pad is
      applied to the disc, the momentum of the rotating disc draws the
      pad farther up an interlocking series of wedges, applying greater
      braking pressure and increasing stopping efficiency. A series of
      electric motors push in and pull out at an extremely high
      frequency, while a torque sensor controls the braking force and
      keeps the wheels from locking up, thus alleviating the need for a
      conventional antilock braking system. With each brake unit
      operating independently from the others, it also means the
      electronic stability control can be programmed to operate on a
      much finer calibration, without the typical pulsating effect
      evident in some cars today. In tests, a prototype with the wedge
      brakes regularly required less than half the distance to come to a
      complete stop than the prototype with the standard brakes, a
      company official said.<br>

        <br>
        <div align="left"> A revolution in braking technology is in the
          making. A new electronic wedge brake currently being developed
          for market launch by Siemens can be used for any type of
          vehicle. But that’s not all. The new brake is also faster,
          less expensive and more efficient than conventional hydraulic
          systems.<br>
          <br>
          Bernd Gombert cranks up the metal disk until it rotates at
          speed. "Now, press here and make it stop," he says. It
          requires strong pressure applied with the palm of the hand
          before the plastic brake pad brings the disk gradually to a
          halt. "Friction," says Gombert in his dry engineer’s manner.
          "That’s how today’s cars brake. Now try the wedge." Once
          again, he cranks the disk up, only this time harder. The small
          wedge is mounted at the side, between a metal pin, which sits
          parallel to the disk, and a guide mechanism. Although the
          metal disk is rotating very quickly, a prod of the index
          finger is all it takes for the wedge to be literally dragged
          onto the disk, which snaps to a halt immediately. "That’s how
          they used to brake horse-drawn vehicles," says Gombert with a
          grin. "And, in principle, that’s how brakes will function in
          the future. A lowenergy, low-cost system with a simple
          mechanical design!" Not that Gombert is advocating a return to
          the horse-drawn era, when wedge brakes were used to provide a
          highly effective but very abrupt means of bringing the wheels
          of a cart or carriage to a halt. Instead, he’s referring to
          the Electronic Wedge Brake (EWB), a development project that
          Gombert heads at Siemens VDO Automotive (SV). "The difference
          is that we stop the wedge from completely locking the wheel by
          preventing it from being fully dragged in between the mounting
          and the brake disk," he explains. The trick here is to allow
          the wedge to be pulled in until the desired braking moment has
          been achieved, but no further. This in turn requires
          sophisticated sensors and a precisely controllable electric
          motor.<br>
          <br>
          For each wheel, the electronic wedge brake has a control unit
          (see diagram above) consisting of a brake pad, a mechanical
          transfer system, two electric motors for precision control,
          and sensors to measure movements and forces. Around 100 times
          a second, a total of four sensors measure wheel rotation and
          therefore the speed of the vehicle, the forces on the brake
          and the position of the wedge. Whenever the driver presses the
          brake pedal, the system transmits the force
          electromechanically to the wheels, which are electronically
          networked with one another. Depending on the sensor readings
          and the braking signal coming from the driver, the two
          electric motors move the brake pad over a series of rollers
          along a slanted surface—the actual wedge. The position of the
          rollers on the inclined surface determines the pressure point
          of the brake pad. When the pad presses against the disk, the
          latter is immediately braked. As soon as a high braking moment
          is generated by increasingly powerful frictional forces, the
          electric motors either hold the brake pad in position or move
          it back over the roller bearing and into an optimum position.
          The distances involved are a matter of micrometers, and the
          response times are measured in milliseconds. The vehicle’s
          onboard 12-V network is perfectly suited to driving the
          electric motors. In fact, a flashlight battery would also be
          powerful enough.<br>
          <br>
          "The intelligently controlled wedge converts the vehicle’s
          kinetic energy directly into braking energy," explains
          Gombert. As a result of this self-reinforcement, the EWB only
          requires one tenth of the actuating energy required by today’s
          hydraulic braking systems. What’s more, it also responds
          substantially quicker. Given this significantly enhanced
          efficiency, the EWB will also have smaller dimensions and
          therefore reduce total vehicle weight. At the same time, there
          will no longer be any need for brake lines, a power brake unit
          or a brake fluid reservoir, which will free up a volume of
          around 22 l in the engine compartment and thereby give vehicle
          designers added scope. "And you won’t need a hand brake any
          more," adds Karsten Hofmann, head of Chassis Product Marketing
          at SV.<br>
          <br>
          Likewise, the well-nigh ubiquitous ABS anti-lock braking
          system and the less prevalent electronic stability program
          (ESP) will be replaced by the integrated software in the EWB
          system. "We’ve developed our own algorithm that reproduces
          these functions," explains Hofmann. "But our system is much
          quicker." All in all, it takes 140 to 170 ms for a
          conventional ABS to generate full braking power. The EWB only
          needs around 100nbsp;ms, an advantage which, according to
          Siemens engineers, should make a difference on uneven and icy
          roads. "Our system can control each individual wheel faster
          than any hydraulic system and thus keep them on course
          better," says Hofmann.<br>
          <br>
          With the EWB project, Siemens VDO is also preparing for the
          time when electric vehicles will claim a much greater market
          share. In fact, successful hybrid cars can already be seen on
          our roads today, including the Toyota Prius, which enjoys cult
          status in California and has been voted Car of the Year 2005
          by European auto magazines. Future electric cars may well be
          equipped with an individual motor for each wheel. This would
          generate substantially higher torque directly at the wheel and
          therefore liberate more power to accelerate the vehicle.
          Another possibility would be to recover kinetic energy during
          braking. Here, the electric motor fitted to the wheel would
          also function as a generator and produce electricity to
          recharge the battery.<br>
          <br>
          Brake by wire. The EWB would be a perfect complement here, as
          it would be able to supply whatever additional and emergency
          braking capacity is required. It could also be used in
          conventionally powered vehicles to provide a range of
          electronic "brake-by-wire" features. These might include a
          "soft-stop" function, whereby the system brings the vehicle to
          a smooth halt by automatically reducing the braking force just
          before it stops, or an antistall assistant controlled by
          software, which would prevent the vehicle from rolling back
          when pulling away on a gradient. Such a feature would
          certainly be welcomed by student drivers. Although the EWB
          requires a constant electrical current, it is immune to
          problems associated with the onboard power supply. "If the
          current to one of the wheels were disrupted, the system would
          automatically compensate by distributing the braking power to
          the others," says Hofmann. And if the vehicle’s entire power
          supply system failed, an emergency battery would ensure that
          all vital functions were maintained until the fault was
          remedied.<br>
          <br>
          However, Gombert isn’t too worried about problems related to
          the new system. He’s much more interested in its potential.
          Gombert was a top researcher at the German Aerospace Center
          (DLR) before leaving to devote more time to the EWB project.
          In 2000 he set up his own company, eStop, which was taken over
          by Siemens VDO in 2005. Gombert holds almost 120 patents, 40
          of them with eStop, for various aspects of the EWB system. In
          September of this year, his team demonstrated the principle at
          the International Motor Show in Frankfurt, Germany, and are
          currently testing the system in a vehicle that will be made
          available to automakers at the end of the year for further
          tests. The pilot customer is a major European automobile
          manufacturer. If everything goes according to plan, the first
          vehicles fitted with the EWB as standard should hit the roads
          in 2009. Before then, however, this completely new technology
          will have to prove that it can compete both technically and
          economically with a braking system that has been successfully
          employed for more than 70 years. Aside from passenger cars,
          Gombert also sees big potential for the new system in
          heavy-duty vehicles. Today’s trucks are fitted with air
          brakes, and it can take up to a second for the brake signal to
          reach a rear trailer. Using the EWB system, it would be
          possible to brake a trailer more quickly and in a more
          controlled way. In principle, any wheeled vehicle can be
          braked using this new system, including high-speed trains,
          which are currently equipped with maintenance-intensive and
          therefore expensive brakes. Gombert also has an eye on
          automation technology, which employs all sorts of motors. His
          vision is that his technology might one day be used to brake
          and regulate anything driven by a motor.<br>

            <br>
            The invention relates to an electromechanical brake (10),
            especially for vehicles, which comprises an electrical
            actuator (18) producing an actuation force and acting upon
            at least one friction member (21) in order to force said
            member against a component (21) of the brake to be slowed
            down, thereby eliciting a frictional force. The invention
            also comprises a self-energizing system arranged between the
            friction member (21) and the electrical actuator (18). Said
            system comprises a wedge arrangement (11) that serves to
            self-boost the actuation force produced by the electrical
            actuator (18). The aim of the invention is to simplify said
            system in terms of design and control technology. For this
            purpose, the actuator (18) has a single electric motor (24)
            and the actuation force produced by it is released via a
            spindle/nut arrangement (30) having a rotationally received,
            stationary spindle (26) and a rotationally fixed nut (28)
            that can axially travel on the spindle by rotating the
            spindle. Alternatively, the nut is received so as to be
            stationary and rotatable and the spindle is rotationally
            fixed and can axially travel. The spindle (26) is
            rotationally received by means of axially prestressed
            bearings (36, 38) and the nut (28) is mounted on the spindle
            (26) in a manner axially prestressed in relation to the
            spindle. The traveling movement of the nut (28) is
            transmitted onto the wedge arrangement (11) by means of a
            transmission element which is connected to the nut (28) and
            to the wedge arrangement (11) with zero backlash.<br>
            <br>
            [0001] The invention relates to an electromechanical brake,
            especially for vehicles, which comprises an electrical
            actuator producing an actuation force and acting upon at
            least one friction member in order to force said member
            against a component of the brake to be slowed down, thereby
            eliciting a frictional force and a self-energizing system
            arranged between the friction member and the electrical
            actuator and comprising a wedge arrangement that serves to
            self-boost the actuation force produced by the electrical
            actuator. The wedge arrangement has at least one wedge with
            a gradient angle a, which is supported against an associated
            support. Such an electromechanical brake is known from WO
            02/095257.<br>
            <br>
            [0002] Another electromechanical brake with a
            self-energizing system is known from the German patent
            specification DE 198 19 564 C2. In the case of the brake
            described in this document, the problem arises that the
            extent of self-boosting, determined by the selection of the
            gradient angle a of the wedge or wedges of the wedge
            arrangement, can always only be dimensioned so large that
            irrespective of the friction coefficient p between the
            friction lining and the component to be slowed down, which
            changes depending on the operating state of the brake,
            either a compressive force or a tractive force is always
            exerted on the wedge of the self-energizing system. A change
            of sign of the actuator force is to be avoided, because
            otherwise the backlash existing in the actuator has to be
            passed through, which results in undefined states and thus
            in unwanted fluctuations in the control parameters (braking
            force). As a result of these restrictions, with the
            electromechanical brake known from the said document, the
            range of the optimum self-boost, namely the range in which
            the value of the friction coefficient u corresponds at least
            approximately to the value tan a, cannot be used, because
            the required actuation force, in other words the actuator
            force, changes its direction at the point of optimum
            self-boost, i.e. if the friction coefficient µ has the same
            value as the tangent of the gradient angle a.<br>
            <br>
            [0003] In accordance with the aforementioned WO 02/095257,
            the problem of the actuator backlash is solved by means of
            an actuator, which has two electric motors, which operate
            against one another in a defined manner in order to
            eliminate actuator backlash which exists in most operating
            situations. Such a solution apparently defines an increased
            outlay in terms of design and control technology.<br>

            [0004] The object underlying the invention is to provide an
            improved electromechanical brake with self-boost, the
            working range of which can lie within the range of the
            optimum self-boost without resulting in negative effects in
            respect of its controllability and which is still configured
            in a simple fashion in terms of design and can be easily
            handled in terms of control technology.<br>
            <br>
            [0005] Based on an electromechanical brake of the type
            mentioned in the introduction, this object is achieved in
            accordance with the invention by a brake having the features
            specified in claim 1 or 2. To simplify the design and
            control technology outlay, the actuator of the inventive
            brake accordingly has only one single electric motor, which
            releases the actuation force produced thereby via a
            spindle/nut arrangement either having a rotationally
            received, stationary spindle and a rotational fixed nut that
            can axially travel on the spindle by rotating the spindle or
            a rotationally received, stationary nut and a rotationally
            fixed spindle that can axially travel by rotating the nut.
            The rotational spindle is rotationally received by means of
            one or several axially prestressed bearings so that no
            unwanted backlash occurs in the actuator. The axial
            prestress of receiving the spindle eliminates any axial
            spindle backlash. The nut is also attached prestressed to
            the spindle in the axial direction in relation to the
            spindle in order to eliminate any backlash between the nut
            and the spindle. Finally, the traveling movement of the nut
            or of the spindle is transmitted onto the wedge arrangement
            by means of a transmission element which is connected on the
            one hand to the nut or the spindle and on the other hand to
            the wedge arrangement with zero backlash. In this way, each
            actuation movement produced by the electric motor of the
            actuator is transmitted with zero backlash onto the wedge
            arrangement of the self-energizing system, irrespective of
            whether the momentary operating state of the brake requires
            the exertion of a compressive force or a tractive force onto
            the wedge arrangement in order to maintain a desired brake
            force.<br>
            <br>
            [0006] In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the
            electromechanical brake according to the invention, at least
            one axially prestressed oblique ball bearing receives the
            rotational spindle in a prestressed fashion in the axial
            direction. The oblique ball bearing is arranged in a known
            manner to persons skilled in the art within this field such
            that it exerts a certain amount of pressure in the axial
            direction and thus eliminates potentially existing axial
            backlash of the spindle received therewith. Advantageously
            in terms of design, two axially prestressed oblique ball
            bearings are used to rotationally receive the spindle with
            zero backlash, with the axial prestress of these two
            bearings then taking place in opposite directions in respect
            of this spindle. All other bearings enabling an axial
            prestress such as e.g. roller or needle bearings can
            likewise be used. Alternatively, the rotational spindle is
            received in a fixed/moveable bearing arrangement.<br>
            <br>
            [0007] With preferred exemplary embodiments of the inventive
            electromechanical brake, the axial prestressing of the nut
            in respect of the spindle is realized here in that the nut
            includes two nut elements which are axially prestressed in
            respect of each other. The two nut elements have an
            adjustable and fixable axial distance from one another. The
            axial distance of the two nut elements is adjusted such that
            backlash no longer exists in respect of the spindle and this
            axial distance is then fixed in order to eliminate any
            backlash between the nut and the spindle. For instance, the
            two nut elements can be connected to one another by way of
            an axial thread, so that the axial distance between both nut
            elements can be adjusted and fixed by means of a counter nut
            by means of screwing the one nut element into and out of the
            other nut element.<br>
            <br>
            [0008] With a preferred embodiment of the inventive
            electromechanical brake, the transmission element is a
            coupling bar which is pivotably coupled to the nut or the
            spindle and the wedge arrangement, the bearing points of
            which are prestressed with zero backlash. According to one
            embodiment, the bearing points are embodied as a polygonal
            profile so that a zero backlash position is achieved by
            means of rotation which is carried out relative to one
            another. The bearing points can also be embodied as solid
            body links, e.g. in the shape of a leaf spring.
            Alternatively, each other transmission element can be used,
            which is either with zero backlash or can be configured with
            zero backlash by suitably embodying its linkage points
            and/or bearing points. For instance, a two-piece rod which
            is pivotably coupled to the nut or spindle and the wedge
            arrangement can be used as a transmission element, the two
            parts of which are connected to one another by means of a
            thread engagement. By screwing the one part into and/or out
            of the other respectively, the length of such a rod can be
            adjusted such that backlash present on the linking and/or
            bearing points no longer has an effect.<br>
            <br>
            [0009] With preferred embodiments of the inventive
            electromechanical brake, the spindle extends in parallel or
            in any case almost parallel to a wedge bevel of the wedge
            arrangement. The wedge bevel is preferably that which is
            used for braking in the direction in which the most braking
            processes are expected. In the case of a brake for a motor
            vehicle, this wedge bevel will be the wedge bevel
            responsible for braking while traveling forward. The spindle
            arranged at least essentially parallel to the wedge bevel
            provides for hardly any and/or no relative movement to still
            occur between the nut or the spindle of the spindle/nut
            arrangement and the component of the wedge arrangement moved
            by the actuator, if this is such a brake in which the wedge
            bevel of the wedge arrangement which is parallel to the
            spindle is used. The spindle which is arranged at least
            essentially parallel to the wedge bevel, which corresponds
            to the main braking direction, is also characterized in the
            case of braking actions in the main braking direction by the
            extensive or complete absence of shear forces, which would
            otherwise, i.e. in the event of an arrangement of the
            spindle selected at least essentially parallel to the wedge
            bevel, act upon the spindle.<br>
            <br>
            [0010] With applications of the inventive electromechanical
            brake, in which the gear reduction of the rotary motion of
            the electric motor which is achieved by the spindle/nut
            arrangement is not sufficient, the electric motor can itself
            be embodied as a engine/transmission unit in order to
            provide a larger overall gear reduction.<br>
            <br>
            [0011] On the whole, provision is made in accordance with
            the invention, as a result of only one spindle/nut
            arrangement and only one electric motor, for a more
            cost-effective electromechanical brake which is easier to
            control in terms of control technology and is of a simpler
            design.<br>

            [0012] Two exemplary embodiments of an inventive
            electromechanical brake are described in more detail below

            [0015] FIG. 1 shows sections of a first exemplary embodiment
            of an electromechanical brake 10 which are detailed here as
            a disk brake for a motor vehicle and which are of particular
            interest within the scope of the present invention. The
            brake 10 includes an integrated self-energizing system, as
            is known for instance from the already cited WO 02/095257,
            to which reference is made in detail. Such a self-energizing
            system has a wedge arrangement 11 with two wedge plates 12,
            14, between which rollers 16 are arranged for friction
            reduction purposes. In order to actuate the vehicle brake
            10, the one wedge plate 12 is moved relative to the other
            wedge plate 14 by means of an actuator 18, as a result of
            which the distance between the two wedge plates 12, 14
            increases. The stroke thus occurring as standard in one
            direction in respect of the main planes of the two wedge
            plates 12, 14 is used to bring a friction member 21
            consisting of a lining support plate 19 and a friction
            lining 20 affixed thereto into contact with a brake disk 22.
            If the brake disk 22 rotates, it exerts a drive force on the
            friction lining 20 by way of the frictional force occurring
            between the friction lining 20 and the brake disk 22, said
            drive force effecting an additional “spreading” i.e. a
            larger stroke of the wedge arrangement 11 and thus a
            corresponding increase in the force, with which the friction
            lining 20 is pressed against the brake disk 22, back to the
            wedge plates 12, 14, without the force generated by the
            actuator 18 itself needing to be increased for this purpose.<br>
            <br>
            [0016] The actuator 18 includes a single electric motor 24,
            which may set a rotationally received, axially stationary
            spindle 26 to rotate. A nut 28 is arranged on the spindle 26
            in a rotationally fixed fashion, said nut 28 being able to
            travel axially on the spindle by rotating said spindle 26.
            As an alternative, the nut can be received in a stationary
            and rotational fashion and the spindle can travel axially in
            a rotationally fixed fashion (not shown). The spindle 26 and
            the nut 28 together form a spindle/nut arrangement 30.<br>
            <br>
            [0017] A coupling rod 32 is used to transmit the axial
            movement of the nut 28 effected by rotating the spindle 26
            onto the wedge plate 12, said coupling rod 32 being
            pivotably coupled with its one end to the outside of the nut
            28 and with its other end to an appendage 34 of the wedge
            plate 12.<br>
            <br>
            [0018] The electric motor 24 of the actuator 18 is activated
            in order to actuate the brake 10 so as to set the spindle 26
            to rotate in the one or the other direction. The desired
            rotational direction of the spindle 26 depends on the
            direction in which the brake disk 22 to be slowed down
            rotates. So that the self-energizing system is able to
            fulfill its function, the actuator 18 must move the wedge
            plate 12 in respect of the wedge plate 14 in the direction
            in which the brake disk 22 also rotates. It is only then
            that the rollers 16 between the two wedge plates 12 and 14
            run to those wedge bevels, which, following contact of the
            friction lining 20 with the brake disk 22, effect a further
            spreading of the wedge arrangement 11 and thus the desired
            self-boost. The spindle 26 is rotated in the opposite
            direction in order to terminate the braking action, as a
            result of which the two wedge plates 12, 14 approach one
            another again and the friction lining 20 disengages from the
            brake disk 20.<br>
            <br>
            [0019] For the reasons illustrated in the introduction
            (possible change between a traction wedge arrangement and a
            compressive wedge arrangement as a function of the
            frictional value prevailing between the friction lining and
            the brake), any backlash in the actuator 18 is unwanted. To
            avoid such backlash, the brake 10, in more precise terms the
            actuator 18 thereof, has a series of measures. The spindle
            26 is thus rotationally received by means of two axially
            prestressed ball bearings 36, 38. In the exemplary
            embodiment shown, the two ball bearings 36, 38 are oblique
            ball bearings, which axially prestress the spindle 26, i.e.
            apply a force acting in the axial direction upon the spindle
            26. The axial prestresses applied by the ball bearing 36
            and/or 38 on the spindle 26 are aligned oppositely, so that
            any axial backlash in the spindle 26 is eliminated.<br>
            <br>
            [0020] To eliminate backlash between the nut 28 and the
            spindle 26, the nut is attached to the spindle using axial
            prestress. In the exemplary embodiment shown, the nut 28
            consists of two nut elements 40, 42, which are connected to
            one another by way of a screw thread (not shown) and can be
            moved axially towards and away from one another by means of
            screwing in the one and/or the other direction. The axial
            distance between the two nut elements 40, 42 can thus be
            adjusted. In order to eliminate backlash, the axial distance
            of the two nut elements 40, 42 is thus changed until there
            is no backlash still present in the spindle 26. The
            established position of the nut elements 40, 42 is fixed by
            means of a counter nut (not shown).<br>
            <br>
            [0021] The coupling rod 32 can have backlash on its linking
            points. To eliminate such backlash, the linking and/or
            bearing points of the coupling rod 32 are prestressed in one
            direction, the available backlash can no longer have an
            effect.<br>
            <br>
            [0022] The said measures ensure that each actuation movement
            of the actuator 18 is transmitted with zero backlash onto
            the wedge plate 12 of the self-energizing system. The
            control of the brake 10 thus proves to be considerably
            easier.<br>
            <br>
            [0023] FIG. 2 shows a second exemplary embodiment of a brake
            10, which only differs from the first exemplary embodiment
            illustrated in FIG. 1 in that the spindle 26 extends in
            parallel to that wedge bevel of the wedge arrangement 11,
            which is used to self-boost braking actions in the main
            braking direction. With one actuation of the brake 10 for
            braking in the main braking direction, no relative movement
            occurs between the moved wedge plate 12 and the nut 28 in
            the case of a spindle 26 which is arranged in parallel to
            the said wedge bevel. No shear forces are then also
            transmitted onto the spindle 26.<br>
