      <div align="center"><font size="+1"><b>The Story of ClO2</b><br>
        </font></div>
      <br>
      Chlorine dioxide is a chemical compound with the formula ClO2.
      Chlorine dioxide has been around for quite some time. As a
      powerful oxidizer, it has been used for a wide range of purposes
      and is effective as a gas or a liquid.<br>
      <br>
      There is more than one type of chlorine dioxide. In most cases,
      commercially available ClO₂ is referred to as “stabilized”
      chlorine dioxide. These products typically require the user mixing
      chemicals to create some chlorine dioxide. While these stabilized
      products do produce some chlorine dioxide they also produce many
      harmful by–products. Toxic and corrosive chlorates and chlorites
      are part of the solution generated with stabilized products.
      Stabilized products usually come in liquid, powder or tablet
      forms.<br>
      <br>
      Commercial generators are also available for the generation of
      chlorine dioxide. Generators generally produce a cleaner version
      of chlorine dioxide when compared to stabilized products.
      Chlorates, chlorites and other corrosive and toxic oxychloro
      species are still present. Generators are generally used for large
      volume production of chlorine dioxide when purity is not
      necessary. Chlorine dioxide generators can be expensive and
      require trained personnel to be safe.<br>
      <br>
      Today, through proprietary technology, you can have a 99.9% pure
      chlorine dioxide solution from SMT. Unlike other forms of chlorine
      dioxide, SMT offers a solution virtually free of the chlorate,
      chlorites and other by-products found in other chlorine dioxide
      processes. The purity of our product makes it ideal for food,
      health care and general disinfection and deodorizing applications.<br>
      <br>
      Why are SMT products so pure? It is because of our patented
      technology. Simply put, the chemical reaction that generates
      chlorine dioxide generates harmful by-products. SMT technology
      traps the harmful by-products in a proprietary membrane so only
      the chlorine dioxide molecule is released into the solution. Pure
      chlorine dioxide means better results with lower toxicity and
      corrosiveness.<b><br>

      </b>SMT carries products for a wide range of needs. Our fast
      release products are widely used in laboratory and clinical
      settings where there is a need for quick access to pure ClO2. SMT
      fast release products are ideal for cleaning water lines and

          <b>Apparatus and method for controlled delivery of a gas</b></font><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Disclosed are apparatus for delivery of a gas, e.g., carbon
      dioxide and/or chlorine dioxide, and methods of its use and
      manufacture. The apparatus includes a sachet constructed in part
      with a hydrophobic material. The sachet contains one or more
      reactants that generate a gas in the presence of an initiating
      agent, e.g., water. The apparatus can also include a barrier layer
      and/or a rigid frame. In another embodiment, the apparatus is
      combined with a reservoir that can be used to deliver a gas to the
      reservoir and, optionally, a conduit. In another embodiment, the
      apparatus is incorporated into a fluid dispersion system that
      includes a dispersion apparatus, e.g., a humidifier<br>
      <br>
      <b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION </b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0002] The invention relates generally to apparatus and methods
      for delivery of a gas and more specifically to apparatus and
      methods for controlling the amount, rate and duration of gas
      delivery. <br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0003] The use of gas for retarding, controlling, killing or
      preventing microbiological contamination (e.g., bacteria, fungi,
      viruses, mold spores, algae and protozoa); retarding, preventing,
      or controlling biochemical decomposition; controlling respiration,
      deodorizing and/or retarding and preventing chemotaxis to name a
      few, is known. Such gases include, but are not limited to,
      chlorine dioxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, nitric oxide,
      nitrous oxide, carbon dioxide, hydrogen sulfide, hydrocyanic acid,
      and dichlorine monoxide. For example, the use and efficacy of
      chlorine dioxide is documented and discussed in various
      publications such as G. D. Simpson et al., A Focus on Chlorine
      Dioxide, An Ideal Biocide (visited Feb. 5, 2000)
      http://clo2.com/readings/waste/corrosion.html, and K. K. Krause,
      DDS et al., The Effectiveness of Chlorine Dioxide in the Barrier
      System (visited Feb. 5, 2000)
      http://www.dentallogic.com/dentist/effects.htm. <br>
      <br>
      [0004] In particular, chlorine dioxide has been found to be useful
      as a disinfectant, antiseptic and sanitizer. It is used, e.g., to
      disinfect drinking water and various water supplies. In addition,
      chlorine dioxide finds use as a bleaching agent for flour, fats
      and textiles. Chlorine dioxide also has shown great utility as an
      antiseptic for treating metal and plastic surfaces, as well as
      other substrates such as countertops, meat processing and
      packaging equipment, and dental and medical instruments and
      devices. <br>
      <br>
      [0005] One disadvantage of the prior art methods for generating
      chlorine dioxide gas generally is that unsatisfactory levels of
      by-products or reactants remain as a residue. For example, in the
      case of chlorine dioxide gas, the byproduct chlorite leaves
      residues on food handling equipment and medical and dental
      surfaces. Human contact with such residues should be avoided or
      substantially minimized according to FDA and EPA regulations. <br>
      <br>
      [0006] Another requirement in the food handling and related
      industries is the need for raw materials or ingredients that are
      safe to handle in the preparation of the disinfectant. The
      requirement is for the inclusion of reagents that are safe to use
      and, after generating chlorine dioxide, produce side products that
      are non-toxic and/or biodegradable. <br>
      <br>
      [0007] Also, although it has great beneficial characteristics,
      chlorine dioxide can not be transported commercially as a
      concentrated gas for its use and instead has been generated at the
      site where it is used. Thus, an on-site gas generation plant
      typically is required to generate the gas that is then delivered
      to the fluid in which it will be used. Such apparatus takes up
      space and represents a significant added expense. Moreover, even
      when prior art apparatus do not require a separate gas generation
      component e.g., those shown in European Patent Publication No. 0
      571 228 for sulfur dioxide generation, such apparatus are still
      undesirable because controlling the amount of gas generated, the
      efficiency of the generation, and the duration of the gas
      generation has proven difficult, if not unsuccessful. <br>
      <br>
      [0008] There exists a need for the controlled, on-site generation
      of gases, such as sulfur dioxide and chlorine dioxide, which can
      be produced safely, efficiently and economically, without the
      necessity for a separate generation plant or unwanted by-products.
      The present invention addresses these needs. <br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </b><b><br>

      </b><b> DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </b><br>
      <br>
      [0062] A novel approach to the delivery of gas has now been
      discovered. By using discrete amounts of reactant contained within
      a multi-layered apparatus, the skilled practitioner can now
      fabricate a gas delivery apparatus that is compact,
      cost-effective, and safe. The present invention can be used for a
      variety of applications, including delivery of gas to air or
      water, for a variety of purposes including disinfection,
      deodorization, bleaching and sanitization. <br>
      <br>
      [0063] One advantage to this approach is that gas can be generated
      without the need for mechanical equipment, thus freeing up any
      space such mechanical equipment would require. Another advantage
      is that the reactants, which can be dangerous to handle directly,
      are isolated from contact with the user by the layers, which
      enclose the reactant. <br>
      <br>
      [0064] Another advantage is that the apparatus of the present
      invention does not allow for the dilution of the reactant. Because
      the reactant remains concentrated within the sachet, less reactant
      is necessary to drive the reaction to completion and the reaction
      is more efficient than it would be if the reactants were diluted.
      Furthermore, because the reaction is driven to completion,
      unreacted reactant is minimized or eliminated. The reactant
      concentration also minimizes unwanted by-products. <br>
      <br>
      [0065] Yet another advantage is that the apparatus is small and
      therefore can be easily and economically shipped and administered.
      Yet another advantage is that the apparatus can be manipulated to
      allow for either rapid or slow delivery of gas. Another advantage
      is that the apparatus can be designed to deliver gas to either a
      gas, e.g., air, or a liquid, e.g., water. Other advantages will be
      evident to the practitioner having ordinary skill in the art. <br>
      <br>
      [0066] In order to more clearly and concisely describe the subject
      matter of the claims, the following definitions are intended to
      provide guidance as to the meaning of specific terms used in the
      following written description, examples and appended claims. <br>
      <br>
      [0067] As used herein the term "sachet" means a closed receptacle
      for reactant. The sachet is "closed" in the sense that the
      reactants are substantially retained within the sachet and the
      sachet volume is substantially sealed around its perimeter.
      However, the material or materials used to construct the sachet
      are chosen to allow entry of the initiating agent and exit of the
      gas generated. The material or materials used to construct sachets
      are referred to herein as "sachet layers." Sachet layers typically
      are constructed from a planar material, such as, but not limited
      to, a polymeric sheet or film. Preferred materials for sachet
      layers are described in greater detail below. Relying upon the
      teaching disclosed herein, and the general knowledge in the art,
      the practitioner of ordinary skill will require only routine
      experimentation to identify one or more sachet layers and/or
      construct one or more sachets adapted for the purpose at hand. <br>
      <br>
      [0068] The sachets of the present invention also can include
      further materials, e.g., a sachet can comprise a barrier layer and
      sachet layer sealed about the perimeters of the layers to define a
      closed receptacle for reactant. Another example of a sachet is a
      rigid frame defining one or more openings and one or more layers,
      including at least one sachet layer, disposed about the one or
      more openings to define a closed receptacle for reactant. Further
      examples and embodiments are described in greater detail herein. <br>
      <br>
      [0069] As used herein the term "envelope" means a closed
      receptacle wherein the envelope volume is sealed substantially
      about its perimeter, which contains at least one sachet and allows
      release of the gas from the envelope. The material or materials
      used to construct envelopes are referred to herein as "envelope
      layers." Envelope layers typically comprise a planar material such
      as a sheet or film, including, but not limited to perforated
      films, non-perforated films and membranes. Preferred materials for
      envelope layers are described in greater detail below. Relying
      upon the teaching disclosed herein, and the general knowledge in
      the art, the practitioner of ordinary skill will require only
      routine experimentation to identify one or more envelope layers
      and/or construct one or more envelopes adapted for the purpose at
      hand. <br>
      <br>
      [0070] "Permeable layer," as used herein, refers to a layer that
      permits passage of gas generated by an apparatus of the present
      invention. Permeable layers typically are constructed from
      polymeric materials. Sachet layers and envelope layers are
      permeable layers. <br>
      <br>
      [0071] "Impermeable layer," as used herein, refers to a layer that
      substantially prevents or hinders passage of initiating agent. As
      contemplated herein, the impermeable layer does not participate in
      the generation of gas in that it does not facilitate contact
      between initiating agent and reactant. Impermeable layers can be
      constructed from various materials, including polymeric material,
      glass, metal, metallized polymeric material and/or coated papers.
      Preferred materials for impermeable layers are described in
      greater detail below. As used herein, barrier layers are
      impermeable layers. <br>
      <br>
      [0072] The skilled artisan will appreciate that what is considered
      to be an "impermeable layer" and what is considered to be a
      "permeable layer" is defined relative to the transmission rates of
      the respective layers used to construct apparatus of the present
      invention and the desired shelf life of the product. Relying upon
      the teaching disclosed herein, and the general knowledge in the
      art, the practitioner of ordinary skill will require only routine
      experimentation to identify and/or construct one or more
      impermeable layers and one or more permeable layers adapted for
      the purpose at hand. <br>
      <br>
      [0073] As used herein "reactant" means a reactant or a mixture of
      reactants that generate gas in the presence of an initiating
      agent. For purposes of the present invention, initiating agent
      includes, but is not limited to, gaseous or liquid water. For
      example, for dry biocidal applications of the present invention,
      such as for the reduction of molds when shipping fruit, moisture
      in the atmosphere can be used as an initiating agent. The term
      "dry application" for the purposes of this application means at
      least an application where the apparatus of the present invention
      is not immersed in water or any other liquid. The term "wet
      application" for the purposes of the present invention means at
      least an application where the apparatus of the present invention
      is immersed in water, or other liquid, which can optionally
      include water. For wet biocidal applications, i.e., when the
      apparatus of the present invention is immersed in water or any
      other aqueous medium, such as that used for disinfecting dental or
      food equipment, the water in which the apparatus is immersed can
      be used as the initiating agent. Alternatively, the initiating
      agent can be included within the apparatus, e.g., contained in a
      frangible pouch disposed within the apparatus. <br>
      <br>
      [0074] Generation of a gas, e.g., by acid activation, is well
      known in the art. For example, chlorine dioxide (ClO2) is
      generated from sodium chlorite and an acid, such as citric acid,
      in the presence of moisture as follows. <br>
      5ClO2&lt;-&gt;+4H&lt;+&gt;&lt;-&gt;4ClO2+2H2O+Cl&lt;-&gt; (I) <br>
      ClO2&lt;-&gt;-&gt;ClO2+e&lt;-&gt; (II) <br>
      <br>
      [0075] Specific examples of this reaction include the following. <br>
      2NaClO2+Na2S2O8-&gt;2ClO2+2Na2SO4 (III) <br>
      2NaClO2+NaOCl+HCl-&gt;2ClO2+2NaCl+NaOH (IV) <br>
      <br>
      [0076] Alternatively, chlorine dioxide can be produced by the
      reduction of a chlorate, e.g., sodium chlorate or potassium
      chlorate, in the presence of an acid, e.g., oxalic acid. Generally
      the reaction occurs as follows. <br>
      ClO3&lt;-&gt;+2H&lt;+&gt;+e&lt;-&gt;-&gt;ClO2+H2O (V) <br>
      <br>
      [0077] For example, reduction of sodium chlorate by acidification
      in the presence of oxalic acid to produce chlorine dioxide can
      proceed as follows. <br>
      2 NaClO3+H2C2O4-&gt;2ClO2+2CO2+2H2O (VI) <br>
      <br>
      [0078] Another example of generation of a gas by acid activation
      is the activation of a sulfite, e.g., sodium bisulfite or
      potassium bisulfite, with an acid, e.g., fumaric acid and/or
      potassium bitartrate, in the presence of moisture to form sulfur
      dioxide. <br>
      NaHSO3+4H&lt;+&gt;&lt;-&gt;SO2+2H2O+Na&lt;+&gt; (VII) <br>
      <br>
      [0079] Yet another example is the acid activation of a carbonate,
      e.g., calcium carbonate with an acid, e.g., citric acid, to form
      carbon dioxide. <br>
      CaCO3+2H&lt;+&gt;&lt;-&gt;CO2+H2O+Ca&lt;+&gt; (VIII) <br>
      <br>
      [0080] Other applications will be apparent to the skilled
      practitioner. For example, the generation of nitrogen dioxide by
      the acid activation of a nitrite, e.g., sodium nitrite or
      potassium nitrite. Alternative routes for generation of a gas,
      e.g., reduction of chlorates by sulfur dioxide (Mathieson
      Process), are well known in the art and can be utilized in
      accordance with the present invention. <br>
      <br>
      [0081] The present invention can be used in a wide variety of
      applications. For example, chlorine dioxide can be used for the
      disinfection of water, e.g., municipal water treatment: as a
      disinfectant for foods, beverages, fruits and vegetables; and for
      the cleaning and disinfection of medical, dental and food
      equipment. Chlorine dioxide has been shown to be an effective
      disinfectant at concentrations as low as 0.2 mg/L. Chlorine
      dioxide is a desirable replacement for chlorine, the traditional
      water treatment chemical, because it has been found to inactivate
      microbes at lower levels and over a wider pH range. For example,
      chlorine dioxide can be used to reduce or eliminate biofilms
      because it penetrates the cell wall of naturally occurring,
      colony-building microorganisms and disrupts the proteins necessary
      for reproduction. Moreover, chlorine dioxide does not produce
      chlorinated by-products, e.g., trihalomethanes. Moreover, it has
      been found to be active against pathogens that are resistant to
      chlorine. It can be used as a slimicide in paper or pulp machines,
      for wastewater treatment, and for industrial water treatment,
      e.g., cooling or recycle streams. It can be used for odor control
      or as an aerial biocide and virucide. It can be used for the
      treatment of sulfides in the oil industry, for industrial
      cleaning, e.g., circuit board cleansing, and for paper or tallow
      bleaching. Sulfur dioxide also has a variety of uses, such as a
      mold and fungus inhibitor for use in shipping and storing fruits
      and vegetables. Based on the teachings disclosed herein the
      practitioner of ordinary skill will appreciate the numerous other
      applications for which the present invention can be used and
      provides a heretofore unmet need. <br>
      <br>
      [0082] The present invention relates to apparatus and methods for
      delivering biocidal-effective amounts of a gas such as chlorine
      dioxide. The apparatus and methods of the present invention
      achieve delivery of a desired amount of gas, at a desired rate,
      over a desired time period. This is accomplished by disposing
      suitable reactants in a defined and confined volume such that upon
      initiation, the reactants, initiating agent, products, and
      by-products are held within a desired concentration range. The
      amount, rate and duration of delivery can be manipulated by, e.g.,
      choice of sachet layers, sachet volume, reactant amount, reactant
      ratio, envelope layers, and envelope volume. Such manipulations
      can be exercised by the artisan using only routine experimentation
      in view of the teachings disclosed herein together with knowledge
      in the art. <br>
      <br>
      [0083] Generally, the present invention also relates to an
      apparatus for delivery of a gas that includes reactant disposed in
      a volume defined by at least one permeable layer and at least one
      impermeable layer. The one or more permeable layers can include a
      sachet layer and/or an envelope layer, and allows release of the
      gas from the envelope. The one or more impermeable layers can
      include one or more barrier layer. <br>
      <br>
      [0084] FIGS. 1A and 1B are a perspective view and a
      cross-sectional side view, respectively, of an embodiment of an
      apparatus 10 constructed in accordance with the present invention.
      In general overview, apparatus 10 includes an envelope 20, a
      sachet 30 disposed within the envelope 10, and reactant 40
      disposed within sachet 30 that generates a gas in the presence of
      an initiating agent, e.g., water. Envelope 20 allows contact of
      the initiating agent with sachet 30 and release of the gas from
      envelope 20. <br>
      <br>
      [0085] Apparatus 10 is particularly useful for the rapid release
      of a gas for wet applications e.g., delivery of 5 to 50 mg
      chlorine dioxide gas per liter of water in 5 to 15 minutes. The
      function of the envelope is to control the influx of the
      initiating agent, while limiting the diffusion of the reactants
      from the sachet to the surrounding fluid, be it gaseous or liquid.
      The envelope also allows the gas to diffuse to the surrounding
      fluid, be it gaseous or liquid. By limiting transmission of the
      initiating agent into the apparatus, and limiting and/or
      preventing diffusion of the reactants out of the apparatus, the
      reactant remains concentrated and the pH of the reactive system is
      localized within the apparatus to optimize the conversion of
      reactant to gas. Additionally, intermediates and/or by-products of
      the reaction, e.g., water, also can contribute to the efficiency
      and/or duration of the reaction by its affect on the equilibrium
      of the reactions. <br>
      <br>
      [0086] The envelope preferably is constructed of a material that
      is durable and stable. Preferably, it also is capable of fusing to
      a like material upon the application of heat for construction
      purposes, e.g., so that two pieces of such material can be fused
      about its perimeter to form the envelope. The envelope can be
      constructed of various materials, including polymeric material,
      such as perforated films, membranes and selective transmission
      films. <br>
      <br>
      [0087] Preferably, an envelope constructed of perforated film is
      constructed of envelope layers having a water vapor transmission
      rate (WVTR) between about 50 g/m&lt;2&gt;/24 hrs and about 1,000
      g/m&lt;2&gt;/24 hrs, more preferably, between about 200
      g/m&lt;2&gt;/24 hrs and about 800 g/m&lt;2&gt;/24 hrs, and most
      preferably between about 400 g/m&lt;2&gt;/24 hrs and about 700
      g/m&lt;2&gt;/24 hrs. The measurement of water vapor transmission
      rate is routine and well known in the art. Also, the envelope
      preferably is hydrophobic. <br>
      <br>
      [0088] Perforated films suitable for the construction of the
      envelope in accordance with the present invention include, but are
      not limited to, polymeric material, e.g., Cryovac(R) perforated
      films available from Sealed Air Corporation (Duncan, S.C.). One
      such film is a hydrophobic polypropylene copolymer film sold under
      the designation SM700 by Sealed Air Corporation and has 330 holes
      per square inch having a diameter of 0.4 mm, a 6.4% perforated
      area, a thickness of about 20 microns, and a water vapor
      transmission rate of 700 g/m&lt;2&gt;/24 hrs. Another suitable
      film is a hydrophobic polypropylene copolymer film sold under the
      designation SM60 by Sealed Air Corporation and has 8 holes per
      square inch having a diameter of 0.4 mm, a 0.2% perforated area
      and a water vapor transmission rate of 65 g/m&lt;2&gt;/24 hrs. The
      artisan can readily identify suitable equivalents of any of the
      foregoing by exercising routine experimentation. <br>
      <br>
      [0089] In another preferred embodiment, the envelope or envelopes
      can be constructed from hydrophobic, liquid water permeable
      material, such as polyethylene or polypropylene. These materials
      preferably are between about 1 mil and about 10 mils thick with a
      water intrusion pressure of about 30 millibars or 30 millibars or
      less. Hydrophobic materials suitable for use as envelope layers in
      accordance with the present invention include, but are not limited
      to, non-woven polyethylene such as the TYVEK(R) non-woven
      polyethylenes from DuPont Company (Wilmington, Del.), e.g., the
      TYVEK(R) 1025D non-woven polyethylene which has an intrusion
      pressure of less than 30 millibars. <br>
      <br>
      [0090] Envelopes can be constructed, at least in part, from a
      hydrophilic membrane having a pore size between about 0.01 microns
      and about 50 microns. More preferably, the pore size is between
      about 0.05 microns and 40 microns, and most preferably, the pore
      size is between about 0.1 and about 30 microns. Preferred
      membranes also include, but are not limited to, the microporous
      ultra high density polyethylene membrane sold under the trade
      designation MPLC from Millipore (Bedford, Mass.), and the
      microporous Nylon 6,6 membrane sold under the designation 045ZY by
      Cuno Incorporated (Meriden, Conn.). <br>
      <br>
      [0091] Selective transmission films are films that are neither
      perforated nor porous, but instead transfer gases through the
      polymer structure of the film. Selective transmission films are
      multilayered or mixed polymer materials, where the layers and the
      polymers are chosen for controlled transmission of gases such as
      carbon dioxide and oxygen. Selective transmission films are
      preferred in dry applications because it allows the gas to diffuse
      out of the envelope, while retaining the initiating agent once
      released from a frangible pouch. Moreover, the selective
      transmission film increases the stability of the apparatus prior
      to its use because it does not easily allow ambient water to
      diffuse into the apparatus, which could prematurely initiate the
      reactants. <br>
      <br>
      [0092] Generally, a film that has a high carbon dioxide
      transmission rate is preferred. While not wishing to be bound to
      any theory, it is thought that the carbon dioxide transmission
      rate approximates the chlorine dioxide transmission rate because
      chlorine dioxide and carbon dioxide are about the same size.
      Preferably, the selective transmissive film has a selective gas
      transmission rate of between about 500 cc/m&lt;2&gt;/24 hrs and
      about 30,000 cc/m&lt;2&gt;/24 hrs for CO2 and between about 1,000
      cc/m&lt;2&gt;/24 hrs and about 10,000 cc/m&lt;2&gt;/24 hrs for O2.
      More preferably, the envelope is constructed of a material having
      a selective gas transmission rate of between about 1,000
      cc/m&lt;2&gt;/24 hrs and about 25,000 cc/m&lt;2&gt;/24 hrs for CO2
      and between about 2,000 cc/m&lt;2&gt;/24 hrs and about 10,000
      cc/m&lt;2&gt;/24 hrs for O2. Most preferably, the envelope is
      constructed of a material having a selective gas transmission rate
      of between about 5,000 cc/m&lt;2&gt;/24 hrs and about 25,000
      cc/m&lt;2&gt;/24 hrs for CO2 and between about 3,000
      cc/m&lt;2&gt;/24 hrs and about 10,000 cc/m&lt;2&gt;/24 hrs for O2.
      Measurement of selective gas transmission rate is routine and well
      known in the art. One suitable selective transmission film is a
      multilayered polymer film having a carbon dioxide transmission
      rate of 21,000 cc/m&lt;2&gt;/24 hrs and an oxygen transmission
      rate of 7,000 cc/m&lt;2&gt;/24 hrs sold under the trade
      designation PD-961 Cryovac(R) selective transmission film from
      Sealed Air Corporation (Duncan, S.C.). <br>
      <br>
      [0093] FIG. 6 is a graph depicting gas concentration versus time
      comparing various apparatus fabricated with and without an
      envelope. The square-shaped data points correspond to an apparatus
      with an envelope constructed with perforated film sold under the
      trade designation SM60 by Sealed Air Corporation (Duncan, S.C.).
      As described above, this perforated film has 8 holes per square
      inch having a diameter of 0.4 mm, a 0.2% perforated area and a
      water vapor transmission rate of 65 g/m&lt;2&gt;/24 hrs. The
      diamond-shaped data points correspond to an apparatus without an
      envelope. Both apparatus contain 50 mg sodium chlorite and 200 mg
      citric acid. Both include a sachet constructed from an extruded
      polypropylene hydrophilic membrane having a 0.65 micron pore size,
      sold under the trade designation JOTD obtained from Millipore
      (Bedford, Mass.). For both apparatus, the sachet volume was about
      5.5 times the volume of the reactants. Both apparatus were each
      immersed in 1 liter of water and the chlorine dioxide
      concentration measured every 5 minutes for an hour., <br>
      <br>
      [0094] FIG. 6 demonstrates that the inclusion of an envelope
      increases the reaction efficiency, and consequently, the amount of
      gas delivered for the same amount and ratio of reactant is greatly
      increased. In FIG. 6, the apparatus delivers about 12.5 mg of
      chlorine dioxide gas compared to the approximately 4 mg delivered
      by the apparatus without an envelope. Thus, the apparatus with the
      envelope delivered more than 3 times the chlorine dioxide
      delivered by the apparatus without it, both apparatus having the
      same amount and ratio of reactant and the same sachet layer.
      Moreover, FIG. 6 demonstrates the envelope increased the length of
      time in which gas was generated by about 25 minutes. Of course,
      there may be instances where having only a sachet, i.e., no
      envelope, may be advantageous. For example, where the performance
      of the apparatus without an envelope is sufficient, having only a
      sachet may be preferred because production is simplified, as the
      step of constructing the envelope is eliminated, and also because
      material costs may be decreased by eliminating the need to provide
      envelope layers to construct the envelope. <br>
      <br>
      [0095] FIG. 7 is a graph depicting gas concentration versus time
      comparing exemplary apparatus fabricated with envelope materials
      having different water vapor transmission rates. The
      triangular-shaped data points correspond to an apparatus without
      an envelope. The square-shaped data points correspond to an
      apparatus with an envelope constructed from perforated film sold
      under the trade designation SM700 by Sealed Air Corporation
      (Duncan, S.C.) having 330 holes per square inch having a diameter
      of 0.4 mm, a 6.4% perforated area and a water vapor transmission
      rate (WVTR) of 700 g/m&lt;2&gt;/24 hrs. The diamond-shaped data
      points correspond to an apparatus with an envelope constructed
      with perforated film sold under the designation SM60 by Sealed Air
      Corporation (Duncan, S.C.) having 8 holes per square inch having a
      diameter of 0.4 mm, a 0.2% perforated area and a water vapor
      transmission rate of 65 g/m&lt;2&gt;/24 hrs. All three apparatus
      contain the same reactant and amount and ratio of reactant as used
      for the apparatus in FIG. 6. For all three apparatus, the sachet
      volume was about 5.5 times the volume of the reactants. The
      reactants were enclosed sachets constructed from 0.65 micron pore
      size, hydrophobic, non-woven polypropylene material sold under the
      trade designation ANO6 by Millipore (Bedford, Mass.). These
      apparatus also were each immersed in 1 liter of water and the
      chlorine dioxide concentration measured every 5 minutes for an
      hour. <br>
      <br>
      [0096] FIG. 7 demonstrates the effect of the water vapor
      transmission rate of the envelope on the rate and efficiency of
      the reaction. In FIG. 7, the apparatus having no envelope has a
      greater rate of reaction for about the first 15 minutes, but is
      less efficient than the apparatus with envelopes, delivering only
      about 12 mg of chlorine dioxide. The apparatus having envelopes
      exhibit greater efficiency and a longer rate of gas generation,
      which is proportional to the water vapor transmission rate (WVTR).
      The envelope with a water vapor transmission rate of 65
      g/m&lt;2&gt;/24 hrs has the greatest efficiency at about 55
      minutes, generating about 22 mg of chlorine dioxide at a rate of
      about 5.5 mg of chlorine dioxide every 15 minutes. The envelope
      with a transmission rate of 700 g/m&lt;2&gt;/24 hrs generates
      about 18 mg of chlorine dioxide in about 55 minutes at a rate of
      about 4.5 mg of chlorine dioxide every 15 minutes. Thus, for
      applications where it is desired to increase efficiency and to
      generate gas over an increased period of time, an envelope with a
      low vapor transmission rate is preferred. As mentioned above,
      however, there may be may be applications where having a less
      efficient apparatus may be advantageous, e.g., decreased material
      and/or production costs. <br>
      <br>
      [0097] By increasing or decreasing the water vapor transmission
      rate, the practitioner can control the rate and efficiency of the
      reaction to suit the application. For example, it has been found
      that an apparatus having a hydrophobic polypropylene envelope with
      a pore size of 0.1 micron, a 0.65 micron pore size hydrophilic
      polypropylene sachet, and reactants that include 500 mg sodium
      chlorite and 2000 mg citric acid, will generate 3.5 mg chlorine
      dioxide gas per hour for at least 30 hours. <br>
      <br>
      [0098] It has been discovered that the use of a sachet can be used
      to limit the diffusion of the initiating agent into the sachet,
      and limit the diffusion of reactant and reactant by-products out
      of the sachet. As a consequence, the reactants are and remain
      concentrated within the sachet and the pH remains localized
      increasing the efficiency of the reaction. Various attributes of
      the sachet, such as pore size, bubble point, and hydrophobic
      and/or hydrophilic nature of the sachet membrane, can be
      manipulated to control the affect of the sachet on the reaction as
      is described below. <br>
      <br>
      [0099] The sachet preferably is constructed of a material that is
      durable and stable. Preferably, it also is capable of fusing to a
      like material upon the application of heat or ultrasonics for
      construction purposes, e.g., so that two pieces of such material
      can be fused about its perimeter to form the sachet. <br>
      <br>
      [0100] Envelopes and sachets of the present invention can be
      sealed about their perimeter by any known method, such as heat
      sealing, ultrasonic sealing, radio frequency sealing, and sealing
      with adhesives. A preferred method of forming envelopes and
      sachets is to use an impulse sealer, which delivers a rapid and
      discreet thermal pulse to the layers. One impulse sealer suitable
      for use in accordance with the present invention is the 16''
      TISH400 Impulse Sealer available from TEW Electric Heating
      Equipment Corporation (Taiwan). <br>
      <br>
      [0101] The sachet layers used to construct the sachet can be
      chosen to control the diffusion of the reactants out of the
      sachet, control the rate of gas release from the sachet and
      control the initiation of the reactants. For example, a
      hydrophilic sachet will increase the rate at which water and/or
      water vapor diffuses into the sachet, and the pore size and
      thickness of the sachet layer also will effect the passage of
      water, reactants and gas through the sachet layer. <br>
      <br>
      [0102] The sachet can be constructed of various materials,
      including polymeric material or coated papers. It can be
      constructed from woven material, non-woven membrane, extruded
      membrane, or any other material with a controlled pore
      distribution having a mean pore size between about 0.01 [mu]m and
      about 50 [mu]m. <br>
      <br>
      [0103] A woven material is any material woven from cotton, metal,
      polymer threads, metal threads or the like into a cloth or mesh.
      Extruded membranes, which include cast membranes, are preferred,
      and include 0.65 micron pore size, 230 to 260 micron thick,
      hydrophilic polyethylene membrane sold under the trade designation
      MPLC from Millipore (Bedford, Mass.), 0.65 micron pore size,
      extruded hydrophobic polyethylene material sold under the trade
      designation DOHP by Millipore (Bedford, Mass.). Also preferred is
      the cast membrane 3 micron pore Nylon 6,6 material sold under the
      trade designation BIODYNE A by Pall (Port Washington, N.Y.).
      Non-woven membranes are membranes formed from materials such as
      cellulose or polymers. Other cast membranes include 0.45 pore,
      hydrophilic Nylon 6,6 membranes with a polypropylene backbone sold
      under the designation BA05 by Cuno Incorporated (Meriden, Conn.);
      0.45 pore, hydrophilic polypropylene membrane available from 3M
      (City, State); and 0.45 pore size, 180 to 240 micron thick,
      hydrophilic Nylon 6,6 membranes sold under the designations 045ZY
      and 045ZN by Cuno Incorporated (Meriden, Conn.). Also suitable are
      hydrophobic, liquid water permeable non-woven polyethylenes, such
      as the TYVEK(R) 1025D polyethylene material from DuPont Company
      (Wilmington, Del.). <br>
      <br>
      [0104] Also suitable for use in constructing the sachet are
      composite layers, including, but not limited to, starch/polymer
      composite layers. One currently preferred composite layer is a
      hydrophilic, 114 [mu]m thick, non-woven rice starch/polyethylene
      composite sold under the designation 60MDP-P by Mishima Paper
      Company, Limited (Japan). This layer is heat sealable and wets
      easily. Furthermore, this layer does not merely keep the reactants
      apart until initiation, but functions like other preferred sachet
      layers of the present invention in that it controls the rate
      diffusion of reactants out of the sachet, controls the rate of gas
      release from the sachet, and controls the initiation of the
      reactant so that the reactant remains concentrated within the
      sachet and the reaction is driven to completion. <br>
      <br>
      [0105] Non-woven membranes can be formed, e.g., by suspending the
      membrane material, e.g., cellulose fibers, in a liquid over a
      porous web and then draining the liquid to form a membrane.
      Non-woven membranes typically have a relatively narrow and
      consistent pore size distribution as compared to woven materials.
      Consequently, the non-woven sachet generally allows less
      initiating agent into the sachet than the woven sachet having the
      same pore size because, generally the pore size distribution is
      narrower. A non-woven membrane suitable for use in accordance with
      the present invention is the 0.65 micron pore size, hydrophobic,
      non-woven polypropylene material sold under the trade designation
      ANO6 by Millipore (Bedford, Mass.). <br>
      <br>
      [0106] In a preferred embodiment the sachet is constructed from a
      membrane having a pore size between about 0.01 [mu]m and about 50
      [mu]m. More preferably, the pore size is between about 0.05 [mu]m
      and about 40 [mu]m, and most preferably, the pore size is between
      about 0.10 [mu]m and 30 [mu]m. The pore size of the sachet is
      measured by bubble point. Bubble point is a measurement well known
      in the art which approximates pore size from a measurement of the
      pressure necessary to drive a bubble of gas through the membrane.
      Pore size affects the rate at which water and ions can diffuse
      through the sachet in both directions. A pore size preferably is
      chosen that allows entry of initiating agent into the sachet and,
      at the same time, retains the reactants within the sachet at a
      high concentration so that the reaction rate is increased and a
      high efficiency maintained. The artisan can readily identify
      suitable equivalents of any of the foregoing by exercising routine
      experimentation. <br>
      <br>
      [0107] Preferably, the sachet is constructed from a membrane
      having a thickness between about 50 microns and 500 microns, more
      preferably between about 100 microns and 400 microns, and most
      preferably between about 150 microns and 300 microns. <br>
      <br>
      [0108] In certain preferred embodiments, the material used to
      construct the sachet preferably has a bubble point between about 3
      psi and about 100 psi, more preferably between about 5 psi and
      about 80 psi, and most preferably between about 10 psi and about
      70 psi. As mentioned previously, the measurement of bubble point
      is routine and well known in the art and typically is supplied by
      suppliers of membranes, films, etc., however, the practitioner can
      readily make measurement. <br>
      <br>
      [0109] Additionally, the sachet can be constructed from material
      that is hydrophobic and/or hydrophilic. It can also comprise a
      material having one or more hydrophilic zones and one or more
      hydrophobic zones. These zones can be created, e.g., by printing a
      functional chemical group or polymer onto a surface of the sachet
      that is hydrophilic or hydrophobic or charged to create one or
      more hydrophilic or hydrophobic or charged zones. For example, a
      sulfonic acid group can be disposed on the surface of the
      polypropylene membrane, creating zones that are both hydrophilic
      and negatively charged (R-SO2&lt;-&gt;). The membrane can then
      washed with a dilute acid such that the ion exchange groups
      (R-SO2&lt;-&gt;) bind the H&lt;+&gt; ions. These H&lt;+&gt; ions
      can later be released to supply H&lt;+&gt; ions to acid activate
      reactant, e.g., chlorite, as a replacement or supplement to acid
      reactant. <br>
      <br>
      [0110] When the sachet is constructed of hydrophobic material, the
      hydrophobic material preferably has a flow time between about 10
      sec/500 ml and about 3,500 sec/500 ml for 100% IPA at 14.2 psi.
      More preferably, the material has a flow time between about 60
      sec/500 ml and about 2,500 sec/500 ml for 100% IPA at 14.2 psi,
      and most preferably, the material has a flow time between about
      120 sec/500 ml and about 1,500 sec/500 ml for 100% IPA at 14.2
      psi. <br>
      <br>
      [0111] When the sachet is constructed of hydrophilic material as
      described above the hydrophilic material preferably has a flow
      time between about 5 sec/500 ml and about 800 sec/500 ml for 100%
      IPA at 14.2 psi. More preferably, the material has a flow time
      between about 20 sec/500 ml and about 400 sec/500 ml for 100% IPA
      at 14.2 psi, and most preferably, the material has a flow time
      between about 50 sec/500 ml and about 300 sec/500 ml for 100% IPA
      at 14.2 psi. Measurement of flow time is routine and well known in
      the art. <br>
      <br>
      [0112] Yet another alternative embodiment uses a material to
      construct the sachet that has a first surface that is hydrophilic
      and a second surface that is hydrophobic. For example, a sachet
      can be constructed from such a material such that the hydrophilic
      surface is on the outside of the sachet and the hydrophobic
      surface is on the inside of the sachet. The exterior, hydrophilic
      surface aids the initiation of the reaction since water will
      readily wet a hydrophilic surface and enter the sachet. However,
      once inside the sachet, the hydrophobic, interior surface limits
      water passage out of the sachet. This keeps the reactants
      concentrated within the sachet while allowing the gas to escape
      thus exploiting the advantages of the discoveries disclosed
      herein. One such material suitable for use in the present
      invention is a non-woven membrane 0.65 micron pore size diameter
      formed from a hydrophobic material, such as polypropylene, that
      has been chemically functionalized with amines and carboxyl groups
      to produce a charge, hydrophilic surface. <br>
      <br>
      [0113] The ratio of sachet volume to reactant volume also can be
      manipulated to control the concentration of the reactants,
      intermediates, by-products, etc. within the sachet. As discussed
      previously, increasing the concentration of reactants generally
      increases reaction efficiency. Preferably the sachet volume is
      less than about 20 times the volume of reactant, more preferably
      less than about 10 times the volume of the reactant. Most
      preferably, it is less than 6 times the volume of the reactants.
      Smaller volumes are preferred in certain applications because when
      the ratio of sachet volume to reactant volume is small, water
      produced in the reaction increases the pressure inside the sachet
      reducing the rate at which water can diffuse into the sachet, the
      water to reactant ratio remains constant and thus the rate of
      reaction remains constant. Preferably the volume of the envelope
      is from about 2 to about 6 times the volume of the sachet. <br>
      <br>
      [0114] FIG. 8 is a graph depicting gas concentration versus time
      comparing exemplary apparatus fabricated with and without a
      sachet. Specifically, FIG. 8 depicts gas concentration versus time
      comparing delivery of chlorine dioxide gas from reactant within a
      sachet versus reactant added directly to water, i.e., with neither
      sachet nor envelope. The triangular-shaped data points indicate
      the rate of delivery of chlorine dioxide over time in 1 liter of
      water from a sachet material constructed from a 0.65 micron pore
      size, hydrophilic polypropylene membrane sold under the trade
      designation MPLC by Millipore (Bedford, Conn.). The sachet
      contained 200 mg citric acid and 50 mg of sodium chlorite. The
      sachet volume was about 5.5 times the volume of the reactants. The
      sachet was enclosed in an envelope constructed from perforated
      film sold under the trade designation SM700 by Sealed Air
      Corporation having 330 holes per square inch having a diameter of
      0.4 mm, a 6.4% perforated area and a water vapor transmission rate
      of 700 g/m&lt;2&gt;/24 hrs. The diamond-shaped data points
      indicate the rate of delivery of chlorine dioxide over time when
      the same reactants in the same amounts were added to 1 liter of
      water directly, i.e., with neither sachet nor envelope. The
      apparatus with the sachet delivered more than 10 times the
      chlorine dioxide than when the reactants were added directly to
      the water. As can be seen from FIG. 8, the sachet increases the
      efficiency of the reaction. <br>
      <br>
      [0115] FIG. 9 is a graph depicting gas concentration versus time
      comparing an exemplary apparatus fabricated with extruded and
      non-woven sachets. The diamond-shaped data points indicate
      delivery of chorine dioxide over time for the apparatus with a
      sachet constructed from 0.65 micron pore size, hydrophobic,
      non-woven polypropylene material sold under the trade designation
      ANO6 by Millipore (Bedford, Mass.). The square-shaped data points
      indicate delivery of chorine dioxide over time for the apparatus
      with a sachet constructed from 0.65 micron pore size, extruded
      hydrophobic polypropylene material sold under the trade
      designation DOHP by Millipore (Bedford, Mass.). Both sachets
      contained 200 mg citric acid and 50 mg of sodium chlorite and the
      sachet volume was about 5.5 times the volume of the reactants.
      Neither apparatus included an envelope. The apparatus were each
      immersed in 1 liter of water and the chlorine dioxide gas
      concentration measured every five minutes for an hour. <br>
      <br>
      [0116] As shown in FIG. 9, both apparatus deliver chlorine dioxide
      at approximately the same rate for about the first 20 minutes.
      However, as the reactants become increasingly dilute in the
      extruded sachet relative to the non-woven sachet, the rate of the
      chlorine dioxide release diminishes. The efficiency of the
      reaction in the apparatus with the non-woven sachet is greater
      than that with the extruded sachet. The apparatus with the
      non-woven sachet also continue to generate chlorine dioxide gas at
      a rate of about 2 mg every 5 minutes for about 15 minutes longer
      than the apparatus with the extruded sachet. As mentioned above,
      non-woven sachets generally have a relatively narrow pore size
      distribution, and without wishing to be bound to any theory, it is
      thought that this accounts for the greater efficiency and longer
      period of gas generation. Thus, FIG. 9 provides a non-limiting
      illustration of how sachet material choice, and thus reactant
      concentration, can be exploited to sustain the rate of gas release
      and increase the efficiency. <br>
      <br>
      [0117] FIG. 10 is a graph depicting gas generation versus time
      comparing exemplary apparatus fabricated with sachets made of
      materials having hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces. The
      triangular-shaped data points correspond to an apparatus with a
      sachet constructed from 0.65 micron pore size, hydrophilic
      polypropylene sachet sold under the trade designation MPLC from
      Millipore (Bedford, Mass.). The diamond-shaped data points
      correspond to an apparatus with a sachet constructed from 0.65
      micron pore size, extruded hydrophobic polypropylene material sold
      under the trade designation DOHP by Millipore (Bedford, Mass.).
      The square-shaped data points correspond to adding the reactant
      directly to the water. The reactant was 200 mg citric acid and 50
      mg of sodium chlorite and the sachet volume was about 5.5 times
      the volume of the reactants. Neither sachet was enclosed in an
      envelope. The apparatus and the reactant were each immersed in 1
      liter of water and the chlorine dioxide gas concentration was
      measured every 5 minutes for an hour. <br>
      <br>
      [0118] FIG. 10 demonstrates that apparatus having a hydrophobic
      sachet results in a more efficient reaction that generates gas
      over a longer period of time than a hydrophilic sachet. In FIG.
      10, the apparatus with the hydrophobic sachet generated chlorine
      dioxide for about 30 minutes at about 2 mg every 5 minutes. In
      contrast, the apparatus with the hydrophilic sachet generated
      chlorine dioxide only for about 10 minutes at about 2 mg every 5
      minutes. As disclosed above in connection with FIG. 6, adding an
      envelope to either sachet will have the effect of increasing the
      efficiency of the reaction as well as increasing the length of
      time in which gas is generated. <br>
      <br>
      [0119] The reactant preferably comprises an aqueous soluble acid
      and a reactant that upon acid activation generates a gas. For
      example, for the generation of chlorine dioxide, preferably the
      reactant comprises an aqueous soluble acid and an aqueous soluble
      chlorite. For the generation of sulfur dioxide, preferably the
      reactant comprises an aqueous soluble acid and an aqueous soluble
      sulfite. Other examples of gas generating reactions are disclosed
      above. <br>
      <br>
      [0120] Any acid can be used as a reactant. However, weak acids are
      preferred, as they typically are safer to handle, produce less
      undesirable by-products, and are less reactive. Also,
      multifunctional acids are preferred. Multifunctional acids are
      acids that have more than one reactive site. For example, the
      trifunctional acid, citric acid, is preferred. Preferably, the
      aqueous soluble acid is selected from the group consisting of
      phosphoric acid, fumaric acid, glycolic acid, acetic acid,
      ascorbic acid, oxalic acid, maleic acid, lactic acid, tartaric
      acid, citric acid and mixtures thereof. More preferably, the
      aqueous soluble acid is selected from the group consisting of
      ascorbic acid, phosphoric acid, oxalic acid, maleic acid, lactic
      acid, tartaric acid, citric acid and mixtures thereof. Most
      preferably, the aqueous soluble acid is ascorbic acid, oxalic
      acid, citric acid and mixtures thereof. <br>
      <br>
      [0121] For applications involving the generation of chlorine
      dioxide, preferably the aqueous soluble chlorite is selected from
      a group consisting of sodium chlorite and potassium chlorite and
      mixtures thereof. Preferably sodium chlorite is used. <br>
      <br>
      [0122] Preferably, the weight ratio of the aqueous soluble
      chlorite to the aqueous soluble acid is between about 1:2 to about
      1:6, preferably from about 1:2.5 to about 1:5, most preferably
      from about 1:3 to about 1:4.5. Preferably, a pH between about 1.5
      to 5.5, more preferably a pH of about 2, is maintained by using an
      excess of acid. Because the reactants are concentrated within the
      sachet, less acid is needed to drive the reaction to completion
      and the pH remains low because the acid is concentrated.
      Furthermore, chlorite is consumed by acid and therefore the
      presence of chlorite is minimized. <br>
      <br>
      [0123] FIG. 11 is a graph depicting gas concentration versus time
      comparing apparatus fabricated with two different reactant ratios.
      The square-shaped data points correspond to an apparatus with a
      1:4 ratio of citric acid to sodium chlorite (50 mg sodium chlorite
      and 200 mg of citric acid). The diamond-shaped data points
      correspond to an apparatus with a 1:1 ratio of citric acid to
      sodium chlorite (50 mg sodium chlorite and 50 mg citric acid).
      Both apparatus included a sachet constructed from 0.65 micron pore
      size, hydrophilic, polypropylene sachet sold under the trade
      designation MPLC from Millipore (Bedford, Mass.). The sachet
      volume was about 5.5 times the volume of the reactants. Both
      sachets were enclosed in an envelope constructed from perforated
      film sold under the trade designation SM700 by Sealed Air
      Corporation having 330 holes per square inch having a diameter of
      0.4 mm, a 6.4% perforated area and a water vapor transmission rate
      of 700 g/m&lt;2&gt;/24 hrs. These apparatus were immersed in 1
      liter of water and the chlorine dioxide gas concentration measured
      every 5 minutes for an hour. <br>
      <br>
      [0124] FIG. 11 demonstrates that increasing the amount of citric
      acid relative to the amount of sodium chlorite increases the
      efficiency of the reaction, in part because the excess of acid
      drives the reaction to completion. The relationship of efficiency
      to reactant ratio is fairly predictable when the ratio of sodium
      chlorite to citric acid is between about 1:1 and about 1:6. Above
      about 1:6, there is little change in the efficiency of the
      reaction. <br>
      <br>
      [0125] Ambient temperature also can affect the efficiency of the
      reaction. Generally, the hotter the temperature of the ambient
      fluid, e.g., water or air, the more efficient the generation of
      gas. Generally, however between the ranges of 10[deg.] C. and
      40[deg.] C., the efficiency improves as the temperature increases.
      The data used to generate FIGS. 6 through 11 and the Examples are
      from apparatus tested at from about 23[deg.] C. to about 25[deg.]
      C. The sachet also can include various other ingredients that will
      be obvious to one skilled in the art, such as drying agents,
      stabilizers, and buffers to control the pH. <br>
      <br>
      [0126] It also should be understood that the apparatus and methods
      of the present invention also are readily applicable to the
      delivery of more than one gas at one time. For example, the
      reactant can include both a chlorite and at sulfite for the
      delivery of both chlorine dioxide and sulfur dioxide. <br>
      <br>
      [0127] FIGS. 2A and 2B are a perspective view and a
      cross-sectional side view, respectively, of another embodiment of
      an apparatus 110 constructed in accordance with the present
      invention. In general overview, apparatus 110 includes envelope
      120 and two sachets 132, 134 disposed within the envelope 120.
      Sachets 132, 134 contain reactant 142, 144, respectively. <br>
      <br>
      [0128] Apparatus 110 is particularly useful for the delivery of
      gas in wet applications. In such applications, reactant 142, 144
      can be, e.g., sodium chlorite and acid respectively, the sachet
      can be constructed from a material with a pore size large enough
      to allow diffusion of sodium chlorite and acid reactant out of the
      sachets, and the envelope can be chosen that does not allow the
      reactants to diffuse from the apparatus and regulates the release
      of gas from the apparatus so that the reaction remains efficient.
      <br>
      <br>
      [0129] The envelope and sachet can be constructed from any of the
      material discussed in references to FIGS. 1A and 1B. Preferably,
      the envelope is a hydrophobic perforated film, such as the
      polypropylene copolymer film sold under the designation SM700 by
      Sealed Air Corporation (Duncan, S.C.) having 330 holes per square
      inch having a diameter of 0.4 mm, a 6.4% perforated area and a
      water vapor transmission rate of 700 g/m&lt;2&gt;/24 hr. The
      envelope can also be constructed from 0.65 micron pore hydrophobic
      polypropylene membrane, such as that sold under the trade
      designation DOHP by Millipore (Bedford, Mass.). <br>
      <br>
      [0130] For wet applications, most preferably the envelope is
      constructed from a cast membrane. Suitable cast membranes can be
      chosen to regulate the entry of initiating agent into the
      apparatus based on the thickness of the layer, the pore size and
      the hydrophobic and/or hydrophilic nature of the membrane. The
      thickness of the membrane is preferably between about 50 microns
      and about 500 microns, more preferably between about 100 microns
      and about 400 microns, and most preferably between about 150
      microns to about 350 microns. The pore size preferably is between
      about 0.05 microns to about 5 microns, more preferably between
      about 0.2 microns and about 1.2 microns, most preferably between
      about 0.48 microns and 0.85 microns. A non-woven membrane suitable
      for use in accordance with the present invention is the 0.60 pore
      size, hydrophobic, polypropylene membrane having a thickness
      between about 250 microns and about 300 microns sold under the
      designation 060P1 by Cuno Incorporated (Meriden, Conn.). <br>
      <br>
      [0131] Sachets 132, 134 can be constructed from hydrophobic
      membrane and/or hydrophilic membrane. Preferred materials for
      sachets 132, 134 are described in connection with the embodiment
      of FIGS. 1A and 1B. Preferably, the sachets 132, 134 are
      constructed from a hydrophilic material, e.g., 0.65 micron pore
      size hydrophilic polypropylene membrane, such as that sold under
      the designation MPLC by Millipore (Bedford, Mass.), or extruded
      polypropylene hydrophilic membrane having a 0.65 micron pore size,
      sold under the trade designation JOTD obtained from Millipore
      (Bedford, Mass.), or a 114 [mu]m thick, non-woven rice starch
      polyethylene composite sold under the designation 60MDP-P by
      Mishima Paper Company, Limited (Japan). Also preferred are the 1.2
      micron and 2 micron pore, hydrophilic Nylon 6,6 membranes sold
      under the designations 120ZY and 200ZY, respectively, by Cuno
      Incorporated (Meriden, Conn.), and the 1.2 and 2.0 micron pore
      size, hydrophilic polypropylene membranes sold under the
      designation MPLC by Millipore (Bedford, Mass.). <br>
      <br>
      [0132] For wet applications, the pore size of the sachet membrane
      preferably is between about 0.01 microns to about 30 microns, more
      preferably between about 0.05 microns and about 20 microns, even
      more preferably between about 0.1 microns and about 10 microns,
      most preferably between about 1.2 microns and 5 microns. A pore
      size of between about 1.2 microns and 5 microns is preferred in
      certain embodiments. Without wishing to be confined to any
      particular theory, it is believed that sachet layers with pore
      sized in the most preferred range allow rapid passage of the
      initiating agent into the reactant and diffusion of the reactant
      into the envelope. The envelope would then be chosen with a pore
      size that does not allow significant diffusion of the reactant out
      of the apparatus. The thickness of the sachet membrane preferably
      is between about 50 microns and about 500 microns, more preferably
      between about 100 microns and about 400 microns, and most
      preferably between about 150 microns to about 350 microns. <br>
      <br>
      [0133] Reactant 142, 144 preferably includes an aqueous soluble
      acid and an aqueous chlorite that upon acid activation generates a
      gas. Preferably, these components are not mixed, but instead are
      separately contained in sachets 132, 134. It is preferred to
      separately contain the chlorite and the acid because this
      minimizes the likelihood of premature initiation, e.g., during
      storage and shipment. Reactant 142, 144 can be liquid or solid,
      but is preferably solid. <br>
      <br>
      [0134] Preferably the citric acid has a particle size of between
      about 15 microns and about 55 microns and is desiccated until
      about 6-8% of the initial weight is removed as excess moisture
      prior to incorporation into the apparatus of the present
      invention. Preferably the sodium chlorite has a particle size of
      between about 15 microns and about 55 microns and is desiccated to
      remove excess moisture prior to incorporation into the apparatus
      of the present invention. <br>
      <br>
      [0135] In a preferred embodiment, the envelope 120 is hydrophobic
      and the sachets 132, 134 are hydrophilic. This preferred
      embodiment is particularly suitable for the delivery of gas in wet
      applications and has a slower rate of gas delivery than apparatus
      10 of FIGS. 1A and 1B. For example, this embodiment can be used to
      deliver gas at low rates over long periods of time, e.g., 20 mg of
      gas per hour over a 24 hour period. This embodiment also is
      preferred for applications where a high efficiency and
      concentration of gas is desired and it is possible to allow the
      apparatus a period of time to complete delivery, e.g., 4 to 8
      hours. This application also is preferred when working with
      relatively large amount of reactants that otherwise might begin
      reacting during construction and storage of the apparatus, e.g.,
      when constructing an apparatus having more than about 1 gram of
      sodium chlorite and 4 grams of citric acid. This embodiment is
      particularly useful for controlling and preventing biofilm
      contamination and as a disinfectant, antiseptic and sanitizer in
      applications where water is stored or conducted through conduits,
      e.g., in swimming pools, water tanks, humidifiers, boat lines,
      beverage lines and the like. <br>
      <br>
      [0136] Optionally, this embodiment could contain a second envelope
      (not shown) enclosing the first envelope 120. This second envelope
      might be useful, for example, in further regulating the
      introduction of the initiating agent through the envelope walls. <br>
      <br>
      [0137] Optionally, this embodiment could contain a third sachet as
      depicted in FIG. 19, which is a cross sectional side view of
      apparatus 1210 constructed in accordance with the present
      invention. Apparatus 1210 generally includes envelope 1220, and
      sachets 1232, 1234 and 1236, disposed within envelope 1220.
      Sachets 1232, 1234 and 1236 contain reactant 1242, 1244, and 1246,
      respectively. This embodiment is particularly useful, for example,
      when it is desired to separate acid and chlorite into separate
      sachets and the volume of one is significantly greater than the
      other, e.g., the volume of acid is greater than the volume of
      chlorite. In this instance, one can separate the acid 1242 and
      1246, into two sachets 1232, 1236 that are disposed on each side
      of the chlorite 1244 disposed within sachet 1234. This embodiment
      is preferred when using larger amounts of reactant, e.g., one
      could construct an apparatus similar to that depicted in FIG. 19,
      with 2 grams of sodium chlorite in one sachet, disposed between
      two sachets with 4-5 grams of citric acid in each. All other
      variables being equal, this embodiment is more efficient than
      embodiments having only two sachets when working with larger
      amounts of reactant. This embodiment also is easier to
      manufacture. <br>
      <br>
      [0138] In a currently preferred embodiment, the reactant includes
      citric acid disposed in sachets 1232, 1236 and sodium chlorite is
      disposed in sachet 1234. The sachets 1232, 1234, 1236 are
      constructed from 114 [mu]m thick, non-woven rice starch
      polyethylene composite sold under the designation 60MDP-P by
      Mishima Paper Company, Limited (Japan), and the envelopes are
      constructed from 0.60 pore size, hydrophobic polypropylene
      membrane having a thickness between about 250 microns and about
      300 microns sold under the designation 060P1 by Cuno Incorporated
      (Meriden, Conn.). <br>
      <br>
      [0139] This embodiment is particularly useful for controlling and
      preventing contamination and as a disinfectant, antiseptic and
      sanitizer in applications where water is stored or conducted
      through conduits, e.g., in swimming pools, water tanks,
      humidifiers, boat lines, beverage lines and the like. <br>
      <br>
      [0140] FIGS. 3A and 3B are a perspective view and a
      cross-sectional side view, respectively, of an apparatus 210
      constructed in accordance with the present invention. Apparatus
      210 includes first sachet 232, first reactant 242 disposed within
      first sachet 232, second sachet 234, second reactant 244 disposed
      within second sachet 234, third sachet 250 disposed about first
      sachet 232 and second sachet 234, and envelope 220 disposed about
      third sachet 250. Disposed within the envelope 220 adjacent to the
      third sachet 250 is frangible pouch 260, and initiating agent 264
      disposed within frangible pouch 260. <br>
      <br>
      [0141] Apparatus 210 is particularly useful for the delivery of
      gas in a dry application because initiating agent 264 is contained
      within the apparatus 210. In this embodiment, first reactant 242
      and second reactant 244 generate a gas in the presence of
      initiating agent 264. For this to occur, frangible pouch 260 is
      ruptured, e.g., by exerting pressure on frangible pouch 260 so
      that initiating agent 264 is delivered into first envelope 220.
      Third sachet 250 allows contact of initiating agent 264 with first
      sachet 232 and second sachet 242. <br>
      <br>
      [0142] First sachet 232, second sachet 234, first reactant 242 and
      second reactant 244 are described above in reference to the
      embodiments shown in FIGS. 1A, 1B, 2A and 2B. In a currently
      preferred embodiment, first sachet 232 and second sachet 234 are
      constructed from a hydrophilic material having a pore size between
      about 3 microns and 5 microns. A suitable material is a 3 micron
      pore Nylon 6,6 material sold under the trade designation BIODYNE A
      by Pall (Port Washington, N.Y.). <br>
      <br>
      [0143] Third sachet 250 preferably is constructed using the
      materials described above in reference to the sachet material for
      the embodiments described for FIGS. 2A and 2B. The materials
      described above in reference to the embodiment described for FIGS.
      1A and 1B can also be used. A suitable sachet layers is 0.65
      micron pore hydrophobic polypropylene membrane, such as that sold
      under the trade designation DOHP by Millipore (Bedford, Mass.).
      The third sachet limits the diffusion of reactant out of the third
      sachet and thus, it keeps the reactant concentrated within the
      third sachet and the pH localized. Preferably, the third sachet
      volume is less than 4 times that of the first reactant and the
      second reactant combined, and most preferably less than 2 times
      that of the first reactant and the second reactant combined. <br>
      <br>
      [0144] Preferably, envelope 220 is constructed from a selective
      transmission film. Selective transmission films are described
      above in connection with FIGS. 1A and 1B. As discussed above,
      selective transmission films are preferred in dry applications
      because it allows the gas to diffuse out of the envelope, while
      retaining the initiating agent once released from the frangible
      pouch. Moreover, the selective transmission film increases the
      stability of the apparatus prior to its use because it does not
      easily allow ambient water to diffuse into the apparatus, which
      could prematurely initiate the reactants. Furthermore, keeping the
      reactant, e.g., sodium chlorite and acid, separated into two
      sachets also can increase the stability of the apparatus because
      it retards initiation should initiating agent diffuse into the
      apparatus prior to rupturing the frangible pouch. <br>
      <br>
      [0145] One suitable selective transmission film is a multilayered
      polymer film having a carbon dioxide transmission rate of 21,000
      cc/m&lt;2&gt;/24 hrs and an oxygen transmission rate of 7,000
      cc/m&lt;2&gt;/24 hrs sold under the trade designation PD-961
      Cryovac(R) selective transmission film from Sealed Air Corporation
      (Duncan, S.C.). <br>
      <br>
      [0146] Frangible pouch 260 can be constructed of any material that
      ruptures when pressure is applied to the envelope thus releasing
      the initiating agent inside it. Preferably, the frangible pouch is
      constructed from a multi-layer plastic, e.g., polyolefin, envelope
      having a weak layer positioned near the sealing surface that will
      fail under pressure. Initiating agent 264 can be any agent that
      initiates a gas-generating reaction, e.g., water. Preferably the
      initiating agent is water or an aqueous solution, but is not
      limited thereto. <br>
      <br>
      [0147] The skilled practitioner will appreciate that the first
      reactant 242 and the second reactant 244 can be combined and
      disposed in a single sachet, i.e., first sachet 232 and second
      sachet 234 can be combined into a single sachet (not shown).
      Moreover, the initiating agent 264 disposed in frangible pouch 260
      can be disposed within the volume defined by the third sachet 250
      (also not shown). <br>

      [0148] FIGS. 4A and 4B are a perspective view and a
      cross-sectional side view, respectively, of still yet another
      embodiment of an apparatus 310 constructed in accordance with the
      present invention. In general overview, apparatus 310 includes
      sachet 370 and partition 380 disposed within sachet 370 defining
      first volume 382 and second volume 384 within sachet 370. Also
      shown is first reactant 342 disposed within first volume 382 and
      second reactant 344 disposed within second volume 384. In this
      embodiment, first reactant 342 and second reactant 344 generate a
      gas in the presence of an initiating agent, and sachet 370 allows
      entry of an initiating agent into apparatus 310. <br>
      <br>
      [0149] Preferably, sachet 370 is constructed using a hydrophobic
      membrane to retard entry of the initiating agent into the
      apparatus. Preferably, partition 380 is constructed using
      hydrophilic membrane so that the initiating agent, once within the
      apparatus, will migrate to partition 380. These hydrophobic and
      hydrophilic membranes are described above for the embodiments
      depicted in FIGS. 1A, 1B, 2A, and 2B. Similarly first reactant 342
      and second reactant 344 are described above for the embodiments
      depicted in FIGS. 1A, 1B, 2A, and 2B. If, for example, first
      reactant 342 consists of sodium chlorite and second reactant 344
      consists of citric acid, reaction begins when an initiating agent
      reaches partition 380. In a preferred embodiment, sachet 370 is
      constructed from 0.65 micron pore hydrophobic polypropylene
      membrane, such as that sold under the trade designation DOHP by
      Millipore (Bedford, Mass.), and partition 380 is constructed from
      0.65 micron pore hydrophilic polypropylene membrane, such as that
      sold under the designation MPLC by Millipore (Bedford, Mass.). <br>
      <br>
      [0150] Optionally, the apparatus depicted in FIGS. 4A and 4B may
      further comprise an envelope (not shown) enclosing the sachet.
      This envelope can be constructed from any of the envelope
      materials described above for the embodiments depicted in FIGS.
      1A, 1B, 2A and 2B. Preferably, the envelope is a hydrophobic
      perforated film, such as the polypropylene copolymer film sold
      under the designation SM700 by Sealed Air Corporation (Duncan,
      S.C.) having 330 holes per square inch having a diameter of 0.4
      mm, a 6.4% perforated area and a water vapor transmission rate of
      700 g/m&lt;2&gt;/24 hr. In a currently preferred embodiment, the
      envelope is constructed from a selective transmission film, such
      as the PD-961 Cryovac(R) selective transmission film from Sealed
      Air Corporation (Duncan, S.C.) disclosed above in connection with
      FIGS. 3A and 3B. Additionally, the apparatus can further comprise
      a frangible pouch, and initiating agent disposed within frangible
      pouch, disposed within the envelope. <br>
      <br>
      [0151] FIGS. 5A and 5B are a perspective view and a
      cross-sectional side view, respectively, of still yet another
      embodiment of an apparatus 410 constructed in accordance with the
      present invention. In general overview, apparatus 410 includes
      sachet 430 and reactant 440 disposed within sachet 430 that
      generates a gas in the presence of an initiating agent. Sachet 430
      allows contact of the initiating agent with the reactant and
      release of the gas from the apparatus. <br>
      <br>
      [0152] There may be instances where having only a sachet, i.e., no
      envelope, may be preferred over embodiments that further include
      envelopes. For example, where the performance of the apparatus
      without an envelope is sufficient, this embodiment is preferred,
      because production is simplified as the step of constructing the
      envelope is eliminated, and also because material costs may be
      decreased by eliminating the need to provide envelope layers to
      construct the envelope. <br>
      <br>
      [0153] Sachet materials can be constructed from the materials
      described above for the embodiments depicted in FIGS. 1A, 1B, 2A,
      and 2B. Preferably, the sachet is constructed using hydrophobic
      membrane so that the sachet limits the amount of water entering
      the sachet. Similarly, reactant 440 is described above for the
      embodiments depicted in FIGS. 1A, 1B, 2A, and 2B. <br>
      <br>
      [0154] FIGS. 8, 9, and 10 depict concentration versus time for
      various apparatus that include a sachet but do not include
      envelopes. A currently preferred embodiment is an apparatus where
      the sachet is constructed from a 0.65 micron pore size,
      hydrophobic polypropylene membrane sold under the trade
      designation DOHP by Millipore (Bedford, Mass.). The diamond-shaped
      data points in FIGS. 9 and 10 depict the performance of an
      apparatus with a sachet and without an envelope constructed from
      this material. <br>
      <br>
      [0155] In view of the collective teachings and guidance set forth
      herein, the practitioner can design, fabricate, test and use any
      number of embodiments of the present invention. All that is
      required is an ordinary level of skill in the art and some routine
      experimentation. For example, for a disinfection application, a
      practitioner initially should determine the volume to be
      disinfected using a gas-generating apparatus of the instant
      invention. Next, appreciating that the current standard for cold
      sterilization/disinfection is 5 mg/L chlorine dioxide, the
      practitioner should determine the quantity of chlorine dioxide
      that will be required to disinfect the desired volume. <br>
      <br>
      [0156] From the volume of chlorine dioxide gas required, the
      amount and ratio of reactant necessary to generate this amount of
      chlorine dioxide can be calculated. Of course, if a practitioner
      wishes to increase or decrease the disinfecting concentration,
      then one can adjust the reactant quantities placed in a sachet.
      Representative data generated with varying ratios of reactants are
      depicted in FIG. 11, for example. Variations in amounts generally
      are proportional, e.g., doubling the amount of sodium chlorite
      will double the amount of chlorine dioxide gas generated, if all
      other elements of the apparatus remain the same. Of course, the
      amount of gas generated can also be increased by envelope choice
      as described in connection with FIGS. 6 and 7. <br>
      <br>
      [0157] Also, the practitioner should determine the time course of
      release of the disinfecting gas and choose sachet layers and
      envelope layers accordingly. For example, if a rapid release is
      desired, then reactants can be contained within a sachet
      fabricated from hydrophilic material; if a less rapid release is
      desired, then reactants can be contained in a hydrophobic
      material. Representative data generated with hydrophobic and
      hydrophilic sachet material are depicted in FIG. 10.
      Representative data generated with reactants housed in various
      embodiments of sachets and envelopes as taught by the present
      invention are depicted in FIGS. 6 through 11. The skilled artisan
      will appreciate that intermediate rates of release can be
      accomplished by mixing and matching different sachet layers and
      different envelope layers. Only routine experimentation is
      required. <br>
      <br>
      [0158] Another aspect of the present invention features a method
      of forming an apparatus for delivery of a gas. This method
      includes the steps of: (a) providing a multi-layer structure
      comprising a reactant layer centrally disposed between two sachet
      layers, and two envelope layers disposed adjacent to the two
      sachet layers such that the two sachet layers are centrally
      disposed between the two envelope layers; and (b) stamping the
      multi-layer structure such that the two envelope layers form an
      envelope defined about its perimeter by the stamp, and the two
      sachet layers form a sachet defined about its perimeter by the
      stamp. <br>
      <br>
      [0159] This method has many variations and embodiments. For
      example, a second reactant layer disposed between an additional
      two sachet layers can be included between the two envelope layers
      prior to step (a), so that upon stamping, the apparatus includes
      two sachets, each with its own reactant layer inside. Another
      variant adds the following steps to the method described above:
      (c) providing an initiating agent in a frangible pouch and a
      second two envelope layers, (d) stamping the second two envelope
      layers to form a second envelope defined about its perimeter by
      the stamp, such that the frangible pouch and the envelope formed
      in step (b) are disposed within the second envelope. <br>
      <br>
      [0160] Stamping includes any method of forming an envelope from
      the envelope layers and a sachet from the sachet layers, e.g.,
      sealing the perimeter with a glue or other sealant, impulse
      sealing and heat sealing. <br>
      <br>
      [0161] This method is advantageous because it allows the apparatus
      of the present invention to be manufactured quickly and
      inexpensively relative to assembling and forming each individual
      sachet and envelope separately. <br>
      <br>
      [0162] In another aspect, the above method can be modified to
      construct an apparatus without an envelope. For example, the
      method can includes the steps of: (a) providing a multi-layer
      structure comprising a reactant layer centrally disposed between
      two sachet layers; and (b) stamping the multi-layer structure such
      that the two sachet layers form a sachet defined about its
      perimeter by the stamp. <br>
      <br>
      [0163] Yet another aspect of the present invention features a
      method of delivering gas. This method includes the steps of: (a)
      providing an apparatus for delivery of a gas comprising an
      envelope, a sachet disposed within the envelope, and a reactant
      disposed within the sachet that generates a gas in the presence of
      an initiating agent, wherein the envelope allows release of the
      gas from the envelope; and (b) disposing the apparatus in an
      environment that comprises an initiating agent. <br>
      <br>
      [0164] This method has many variations and embodiments. For
      example, the environment can be liquid and the initiating agent
      can be water or the environment can be gaseous and the initiating
      agent can be water vapor. Preferably, the water vapor is that
      naturally diffused in the gaseous environment, e.g., atmospheric
      water diffused in air at ambient temperature. <br>
      <br>
      [0165] In another aspect, the above method can be modified to
      includes the steps of: (a) providing an apparatus for delivery of
      a gas comprising a sachet and a reactant disposed within the
      sachet that generates a gas in the presence of an initiating
      agent; and (b) disposing the apparatus in an environment that
      comprises an initiating agent. <br>
      <br>
      [0166] Optionally, to further increase stability of any of the
      apparatus of the present invention during storage and shipment,
      any desiccant, such as silica gel or molecular sieves, can be used
      to scavenge initiating agent prior to use of the apparatus. <br>
      <br>
      <b>[0167] Layered Apparatus </b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0168] FIGS. 12A, 12B and 12C are an exploded view, a
      cross-sectional side view, and a perspective view, respectively,
      of an exemplary embodiment of an apparatus 510 constructed in
      accordance with the present invention. In general overview,
      apparatus 510 includes an envelope layer 520, a sachet layer 530
      disposed adjacent to the envelope layer 520, a barrier layer 550
      disposed adjacent to the sachet layer 530, and reactant 540
      disposed in the volume defined by the sachet layer 530 and the
      barrier layer 550. The reactant 540 can generate a gas in the
      presence of an initiating agent, e.g., water. Sachet layer 530 and
      envelope layer 520, are permeable layers that allow passage of the
      initiating agent to the reactant 540 and release of the gas from
      the apparatus 510. Barrier layer 550 is formed to define a cavity
      554 to receive reactant 540, and an edge 558 about its perimeter.
      The envelope layer 520 and sachet layer 530 are fused about their
      perimeter along the edge 558 of barrier layer 550. Apparatus 510
      is particularly useful for the rapid release of a gas for wet
      applications. <br>
      <br>
      [0169] Envelope layers are chosen to control the influx of the
      initiating agent, while limiting the diffusion of the reactants to
      the surrounding fluid, be it gaseous or liquid. The envelope layer
      also allows the gas generated by reactant to diffuse to the
      surrounding fluid, be it gaseous or liquid. By limiting
      transmission of the initiating agent into the apparatus, and
      limiting and/or preventing diffusion of the reactants out of the
      apparatus, the reactant remains concentrated and the pH of the
      reactive system is localized within the apparatus to optimize the
      conversion of reactant to gas. Additionally, intermediates and/or
      by-products of the reaction, e.g., water, also can contribute to
      the efficiency and/or duration of the reaction by its affect on
      the equilibrium of the reactions. <br>
      <br>
      [0170] Preferred envelope layers are described above for the
      embodiments depicted in FIGS. 1A, 1B, 2A, 2B, 3A, 3B, 4A, 4B, 5A
      and 5B. An envelope layer that is currently preferred for this
      embodiment is a hydrophobic polypropylene copolymer film sold
      under the designation SM700 by Sealed Air Corporation and has 330
      holes per square inch having a diameter of 0.4 mm, a 6.4%
      perforated area and a water vapor transmission rate of 700
      g/m&lt;2&gt;/24 hrs at 50% relative humidity. Also suitable is a
      hydrophobic polypropylene copolymer film sold under the trade
      designation SM570 that has 162 holes per square inch having a
      diameter of 0.4 mm mm, a 32% perforated area and a water vapor
      transmission rate of 570 g/m&lt;2&gt;/24 hrs at 50% relative
      humidity and also is available from Sealed Air Corporation. Also
      suitable for use as an envelope layer is the polypropylene layer
      sold under the designation 060P1 by Cuno Incorporated (Meriden,
      Conn.). <br>
      <br>
      [0171] The sachet layer can be used to limit the diffusion of the
      initiating agent into the volume defined by the sachet layer and
      the barrier layer, and limit the diffusion of reactant and any
      reaction by-products out of the volume defined by the sachet layer
      and the barrier layer. As a consequence, the reactant is and
      remains concentrated within the volume defined by the sachet layer
      and the barrier layer and the pH remains localized increasing the
      efficiency of the reaction. Various attributes of the sachet
      layer, such as pore size, bubble point, and hydrophobic and/or
      hydrophilic nature of the sachet, can be manipulated to control
      the affect of the sachet layer on the reaction as is described
      above. <br>
      <br>
      [0172] Preferred sachet layers are described above for the
      embodiments depicted in FIGS. 1A, 1B, 2A, 2B, 3A, 3B, 4A, 4B, 5A
      and 5B. Sachet layers that are currently preferred for this
      embodiment include an extruded, 0.65 micron pore size, hydrophilic
      polypropylene membrane sold under the trade designation MPLC from
      Millipore (Bedford, Mass.). Also suitable for use as sachet layers
      are the nylon 6,6 membrane layers sold under the designations
      045ZN, 045ZY and 045ZL by Cuno Incorporated (Meriden, Conn.). The
      nylon 6,6 membrane layer sold under the trade designation 045ZY by
      Cuno Incorporated is currently preferred and has a thickness of
      between about 180 to about 240 microns, a pore size of about 0.45
      microns, and a bubble point of about 24.1 psi. <br>
      <br>
      [0173] The barrier layer preferably is constructed of a material
      that is durable and stable. Preferably, it is capable of being
      affixed to sachet layers and envelope layers for fabrication
      purposes, e.g., so that the layers can be fused about their
      perimeters to form a defined volume. Preferably, the impermeable
      layer has a water vapor transmission rate (WVTR) of less than
      about 50 g/m&lt;2&gt;/24 hrs at 70% relative humidity. More
      preferably, the impermeable layer has a water vapor transmission
      rate (WVTR) of less than about 2 g/m&lt;2&gt;/24 hrs at 70%
      relative humidity. Most preferably, the impermeable layer has a
      water vapor transmission rate (WVTR) of less than about 0.5
      g/m&lt;2&gt;/24 hrs at 70% relative humidity. <br>
      <br>
      [0174] Barrier layers can be constructed of various materials,
      including metals, polymeric material and/or coated papers. Other
      suitable materials for forming barrier layers include, but are not
      limited to, polymeric layers constructed from, e.g., polyethylene,
      polypropylene, polyester, styrene, including polystyrene,
      polyethylene terephthalate, polyethylene terephthalate glycol
      (PETG), polyvinyl chloride, polyvinylidene chloride, ethylvinyl
      alcohol, polyvinyl alcohol, including polyvinyl alcohol acetate,
      acrylobutylstyrene and/or polytetrafluoroethylene, polyacrylate
      and polyamide, including nylon. Also suitable are metallized
      layers, e.g., any of the above polymeric layers that have been
      metallized. Also suitable are metallic foils, such as aluminum
      foils. Various other impermeable materials can be used to form the
      barrier film as well, such as glass or ceramics. In addition
      layers that are composites of the above layers and/or laminates of
      the above layers, e.g., paper/film/foil composites are also
      suitable for use as a barrier layer. One currently preferred
      impermeable layer is a 5 mil thick impermeable layer comprising a
      polyester exterior, a metallized biaxially oriented core, and a
      polyethylene interior sealing layer available from Sealed Air
      Corporation (Duncan, S.C.). This layer has a water vapor
      transmission rate of 0.01 g/100 in&lt;2&gt;/24 hrs at 70% relative
      humidity and 122[deg.] F. Another currently preferred impermeable
      layer is constructed from polyvinyl chloride. Yet another
      currently preferred impermeable layer is constructed from
      polyethylene terephthalate glycol (PETG). <br>
      <br>
      [0175] The geometry and size of the barrier layer can be adapted
      to suit various parameters, including the amount and type of
      reactant, the desired surface area of the sachet layer and/or
      envelope layer, and attachments for the storage and use of the
      apparatus. In one currently preferred embodiment, the barrier
      layer forms a cavity to receive reactant. It is also preferable
      that the barrier layer is formed such that it includes an edge
      about its perimeter for forming a seal with the sachet layer
      and/or envelope layer and/or second barrier layer. It is also
      preferable that the barrier layer forms a cavity that, with the
      one or more permeable layers, defines a volume that is the same or
      only slightly larger than the volume of the reactants. That is, it
      is preferable to minimize reactant headspace in the apparatus of
      the present invention. <br>
      <br>
      [0176] The barrier layer also can be formed into a shape such that
      the apparatus is easily inserted into or removed from various
      containers, such as a bottle or pouch. For example, it can be
      formed so that it can be inserted into a cap, such as a bottle cap
      or pouch cap, so that the cap can then be attached, e.g., by a
      threaded seal, snap fit or pressure fit, to a receptacle for
      delivery of an initiating agent and/or receiving the generated
      gas. One such exemplary embodiment is described in greater detail
      in connection with FIGS. 16A and 16B below. The barrier layer also
      can be formed into various other geometries so that it can be
      otherwise affixed to a container, such as to a bottle. Two such
      exemplary embodiments are described in greater detail in
      connection with FIGS. 15 and 18 below. <br>
      <br>
      [0177] The barrier layer can be formed into various geometries by
      various manufacturing methods known in the art, including but not
      limited to, horizontal form film seal, vertical form fill seal,
      blister pack, skin pack, injection molding, blow molding,
      thermoforming, cold forming fill seal, or mechanical forming. Of
      course, the barrier layer also may be flexible and not formed into
      any particular geometry, but sealed about its perimeter to the
      sachet about the reactant. <br>
      <br>
      [0178] The envelope layer, sachet layer, and barrier layer of the
      present invention can be sealed about their perimeters by any
      known method, such as heat sealing, ultrasonic sealing, radio
      frequency sealing, impulse sealing, and sealing with adhesives.
      Preferably, the layers are fused with heat, by ultrasonic welding
      or by impulse sealing. <br>
      <br>
      [0179] Reactant in general, preferred reactants, reactant ratios,
      and the like, are described above for the embodiments depicted in
      FIGS. 1A, 1B, 2A, 2B, 3A, 3B, 4A, 4B, 5A and 5B. Preferably, the
      reactant includes a stabilizer, such as activated hydrotalcite. <br>
      <br>
      [0180] Optionally, in certain embodiments the reactant can further
      include a drying agent, or desiccant, to prevent premature
      initiation of the reactant. For example, desiccant can be added to
      the reactant to scavenge water vapor introduced during
      construction of the apparatus and/or shipping and storage of the
      apparatus, but in amounts small enough such that it would not
      prevent initiation when desired. Suitable desiccants include, for
      example, molecular sieves. Alternatively or additionally,
      desiccant can be separately contained in a permeable layer and
      located adjacent to or within the apparatus of the present
      invention to absorb or adsorb water vapor. One such exemplary
      embodiment is described in greater detail in connection with FIG.
      20 below. <br>
      <br>
      [0181] The ratio of volume defined by the sachet layer and the
      barrier layer to reactant volume also can be manipulated to
      control the concentration of the reactants, intermediates,
      byproducts, etc. within the volume defined by the sachet layer and
      the barrier layer. This relationship is described in above. <br>
      <br>
      [0182] FIG. 13 is a cross-sectional side view of another exemplary
      embodiment of apparatus 600 constructed in accordance with the
      present invention. In general overview, apparatus 600 includes an
      envelope layer 620, a sachet layer 630 disposed adjacent to the
      envelope layer 620, a barrier layer 650 disposed adjacent to the
      sachet layer 630, reactant 640 disposed in the volume defined by
      the sachet layer 630 and the barrier layer 650, and a second
      barrier layer 660 disposed adjacent to the envelope layer 620. <br>
      <br>
      [0183] Sachet layer 630 and envelope layer 620, are permeable
      layers that allow passage of the initiating agent to the reactant
      640 and release of the gas from the apparatus 600. Barrier layer
      650 is an impermeable layer that defines a cuboid cavity 654 to
      receive reactant 640, and an edge 658 about its perimeter where
      the barrier layer 650 is attached to the sachet layer 630 and the
      envelope layer 620. <br>
      <br>
      [0184] The second barrier layer 660 is sealed about its perimeter
      to the envelope layer 620. Preferably, second barrier layer 660 is
      sealed to the envelope layer 620 by a peelable seal where the seal
      strength is such that the barrier layer 660 can be removed from
      the envelope layer 620 without disrupting either the seal between
      envelope layer 620 and sachet layer 630, or the seal between
      sachet layer 630 and barrier layer 650. Until the second barrier
      layer 660 is removed, it prevents initiation of the reactant 640
      because it prevents passage of the initiating agent to the
      reactant 640. Second barrier film 660 can be used to prevent
      passage of the initiating agent into the apparatus when it is not
      in use, e.g., during storage and shipping. <br>
      <br>
      [0185] Apparatus 600 is particularly useful for applications where
      the apparatus 600 is likely to be stored and/or shipped in the
      presence of initiating agent, e.g., water vapor in the surrounding
      air. Apparatus 600 also is particularly useful for applications
      where a relatively large amount of reactant is desired as cavity
      654 is formed to accommodate a relatively large amount of
      reactant. The two barrier layers 650, 660 prevent initiation of
      the reactant 650 until the second barrier layer 660 is removed. <br>
      <br>
      [0186] The envelope layer, sachet layer, and barrier layer can be
      constructed from any of the materials described above in
      connection with the embodiments depicted in FIGS. 1A, 1B, 2A, 2B,
      3A, 3B, 4A, 4B, 5A, 5B, 12A, 12B and 12C. Reactant in general,
      preferred reactant, reactant ratios, reactant volume and the like,
      are described above in connection with the embodiments depicted in
      1A, 1B, 2A, 2B, 3A, 3B, 4A, 4B, 5A, 5B, 12A, 12B and 12C. <br>
      <br>
      [0187] Optional second barrier layer 660 can be constructed from
      any of the materials described above in connection with the
      barrier layer depicted in FIGS. 12A, 12B and 12C. Second barrier
      layer 660 also can be constructed from the same or different
      materials used to construct the barrier layer 650. Currently
      preferred second barrier layers include metal foil, nylon layers,
      polyvinylidene chloride layers, ethylvinyl alcohol layers and
      composites or laminate of these layers, such as a metallic
      foil/polyethylene layer laminate. <br>
      <br>
      [0188] The second barrier layer can be sealed to the perimeter of
      the envelope layer, or sachet layer if no envelope layer is used,
      using any of the methods described above in connection with
      sealing the barrier, sachet layer and envelope layer of FIGS. 12A,
      12B and 12C. Preferably, the second barrier layer is attached to
      the envelope layer by impulse sealing or heat sealing. Optionally,
      the second barrier layer also can include a device, such as a tab
      along its perimeter that facilitates its removal from the envelope
      layer without disrupting the other layers. <br>
      <br>
      [0189] FIG. 14 is a cross-sectional side view of another exemplary
      embodiment of apparatus 700 constructed in accordance with the
      present invention. In general overview, apparatus 700 includes an
      envelope layer 720, a sachet layer 730 disposed adjacent to the
      envelope layer 720, a barrier layer 750 disposed adjacent to the
      sachet layer 730, reactant 740 disposed in the volume defined by
      the sachet layer 730 and the barrier layer 750, and a second
      barrier layer 760 disposed adjacent to the envelope layer 720. <br>
      <br>
      [0190] Sachet layer 730 and envelope layer 720, are permeable
      layers that allow passage of the initiating agent to the reactant
      740 and release of the gas from the apparatus 700. Barrier layer
      750 is an impermeable layer that forms a hemispheroid cavity 754
      to receive reactant 740, and an edge 758 about its perimeter where
      the barrier layer 750 is attached to the sachet layer 730 and the
      envelope layer 720 by a heat or impulse seal. <br>
      <br>
      [0191] The second barrier layer 760 also is sealed about its
      perimeter to the envelope layer 720 by a heat or impulse seal.
      Preferably, second barrier layer 760 is sealed to the envelope
      layer 720 so that it can be removed from the envelope layer 720
      without disrupting the attachment of the envelope layer 720 to the
      sachet layer 730 and the sachet layer 730 to the barrier layer
      750. Until the second barrier layer 760 is removed, it prevents
      initiation of the reactant 740 because it prevents passage of the
      initiating agent to the reactant 740. Second barrier film 760 can
      be used to prevent passage of the initiating agent into the
      apparatus when it is not in use, e.g., during storage and
      shipping. <br>
      <br>
      [0192] Apparatus 700 is particularly useful for applications where
      the apparatus 700 is likely to be stored and/or shipped in an
      environment that allows contact of the initiating agent with the
      apparatus. Apparatus 700 also is particularly useful for
      applications where it is desirable to utilize relatively small
      amounts of reactant to deliver gas to limited volumes of liquid.
      The two barrier layers 750, 760 prevent initiation of the reactant
      740 until the second barrier layer 760 is removed. <br>
      <br>
      [0193] The envelope layer, sachet layer, and barrier layer can be
      constructed from any of the materials described above in
      connection with FIGS. 1A, 1B, 2A, 2B, 3A, 3B, 4A, 4B, 5A, 5B, 12A,
      12B, 12C and 13. Reactant in general, preferred reactants,
      reactant ratios, and the like, are described above in connection
      with FIGS. 1A, 1B, 2A, 2B, 3A, 3B, 4A, 4B, 5A, 5B, 12A, 12B, 12C
      and 13. <br>
      <br>
      [0194] The second barrier layer can be constructed from any of the
      materials described above in connection with the barrier layers
      depicted in FIGS. 12A, 12B, 12C and 13. The second barrier layer
      can be sealed to the perimeter of the envelope layer, or sachet
      layer if no envelope layer is used, using any of the methods
      described above in connection with sealing the barrier, sachet
      layer and envelope layer of FIGS. 12A, 12B and 12C and 13.
      Preferably, it is heat or impulse sealed or sealed with an
      adhesive. Optionally, the second barrier layer also can include a
      device, such as a tab along its perimeter that facilitates its
      removal from the envelope layer without disrupting the other
      layers (not shown). <br>
      <br>
      [0195] FIG. 15 is a perspective view of still yet another
      exemplary embodiment of an apparatus 870 constructed in accordance
      with the present invention. In general overview, apparatus 870
      includes a pouch 875 having a spout 880 and a cap 885, and
      apparatus 510 as described in connection with FIGS. 12A, 12B and
      12C. The apparatus 510 can be affixed to a wall of pouch 875,
      e.g., by adhesive or thermal bonding. Alternatively, it can be
      located within pouch 875 without being affixed thereto so that,
      e.g., it can be removed and replaced after use. <br>
      <br>
      [0196] Apparatus 870 is particularly useful for the release of gas
      into a desired amount of liquid, e.g., water or air, so that a
      desired concentration of the gas in the liquid can be easily
      achieved. The amount of liquid can be defined by the volume of the
      pouch, pre-measured before addition of the pouch, or the pouch can
      include indicia located on the wall of the pouch to indicate
      various volumes that can be occupied by the liquid. The final
      concentration of the gas in the liquid can be controlled by choice
      of, e.g., of reactant amount, reactant ratio, sachet layer, and
      envelope layer, as described in connection with FIGS. 1A, 1B, 2A,
      2B, 3A, 3B, 4A, 4B, 5A, 5B, 12A, 12B, 12C, 13 and 14. <br>
      <br>
      [0197] The pouch and cap can be constructed from any of the
      impermeable or permeable materials disclosed above in connection
      with FIGS. 12A, 12B, 12C and 13-14. Preferably, the pouch and cap
      are constructed from polypropylene, polyethylene, polyethylene
      terephthalate, metal foil, nylon and/or composites or laminates of
      these layers such as a foil/polyethylene laminate. The pouch can
      be constructed from impermeable materials to avoid introduction of
      initiating agent into the pouch prior to the desired initiation of
      the reactant, e.g., during shipping and storage. One such pouch
      material suitable for use in accordance with the present invention
      is constructed from a 5 mil thick impermeable layer comprising a
      polyester exterior, a metallized biaxially oriented core, and a
      polyethylene interior sealing layer. This layer has a water vapor
      transmission rate of 0.01 g/100 in&lt;2&gt;/24 hours at 70%
      relative humidity and 122[deg.] F. Alternatively or additionally,
      the apparatus 510 can further include a second barrier film as
      described in FIGS. 13 and 14. <br>
      <br>
      [0198] The apparatus 870 can be used by filling the pouch 875 with
      a liquid that includes initiating agent, attaching the cap 885 to
      the spout 880, and awaiting the generation of the desired quantity
      of gas by apparatus 510 into the liquid contained within the pouch
      875. This embodiment can be useful for preparing solutions for
      removing biofilm and/or sanitizing plastic waterlines in dental,
      marine or aerospace applications. This embodiment can also be
      useful for preparing solutions for surface sanitation, infection
      control and the like. Alternatively, any other water reservoir,
      such as a rigid bottle may be used instead of the pouch. <br>
      <br>
      [0199] FIGS. 16A and 16B are a perspective view and an enlarged
      cross-sectional side view of a portion, respectively, of yet
      another exemplary embodiment of an apparatus 972 constructed in
      accordance with the present invention. In general overview, the
      apparatus 972 includes a pouch 975, a spout 980, and a cap 985.
      The cap 985 includes a barrier layer 950, reactant 940, a sachet
      layer 930 and an envelope layer 920. The barrier layer 950 is
      formed to define a cavity to receive reactant 940 and also is
      formed to fit into cap wall 990. The barrier layer 950 is attached
      to the cap wall 990 by snap in pressure fit so that it stays in
      position and can be removed and replaced after generation and
      release of the gas. Cap wall 990 defines an interior thread 994
      that matches exterior thread 996 defined by spout 980. Spout 980
      further includes a second barrier film 995 that seals the opening
      defined by the spout 980. <br>
      <br>
      [0200] Apparatus 972 is particularly useful for preparing
      solutions for removing biofilm and sanitizing plastic waterlines
      in dental, marine, beverage and aerospace applications. This
      embodiment also can be useful for preparing solutions for surface
      sanitation, infection control and the like. One advantage of this
      embodiment is that the barrier films 950, 995 prevent initiation
      of the reactant when not in use, e.g., during shipping and
      storage, by sealing the apparatus by threading the cap to the
      spout in an environment substantially free from initiating agent
      and not removing the cap until initiation is desired. When
      generation of gas is desired, the cap can then be removed from the
      spout, and the second barrier film removed from the spout. The
      pouch can then be filled with liquid in part or entirely, the cap
      replaced and the reaction initiated, such that gas is released and
      enters the pouch. <br>
      <br>
      [0201] Apparatus 972 also is advantageous because the pouch need
      not be constructed from impermeable materials, because the second
      barrier film prevents initiation of reaction when not in use,
      e.g., during storage and shipment. <br>
      <br>
      [0202] The envelope layer, sachet layer, barrier layers, pouch and
      cap can be constructed from any of the materials are described in
      connection with FIGS. 1A, 1B, 2A, 2B, 3A, 3B, 4A, 4B, 5A, 5B, 12A,
      12B, 12C, 13, 14 and 15. Reactant in general, preferred reactants,
      reactant ratios, and the like, also are described in connection
      with FIGS. 1A, 1B, 2A, 2B, 3A, 3B, 4A, 4B, 5A, 5B, 12A, 12B, 12C,
      13, 14 and 15. The cap can be sealed by other means known in the
      art, e.g., by a pressure fitting. <br>
      <br>
      [0203] Optionally, a barrier film can be placed on the opening
      defined by the cap wall. Thus, the cap can be stored and shipped
      separately from the pouch. This can be advantageous, e.g., in
      applications where the pouches can be reused, and thus material
      costs, storage space, storage costs, and shipping costs can be
      reduced. Alternatively, any other water reservoir, such as a rigid
      bottle may be used instead of the pouch depicted in FIGS. 16A and
      16B. <br>
      <br>
      [0204] FIGS. 17A and 17B are a cross-sectional side view and a
      perspective view, respectively, of still yet another exemplary
      embodiment of apparatus 1000 constructed in accordance with the
      present invention. In general overview, apparatus 1000 includes a
      sachet layer 1035, a barrier layer 1050 disposed adjacent to the
      sachet layer 1035, and reactant 1040 disposed in the volume
      defined by the sachet layer 1035 and the barrier layer 1050.
      Sachet layer 1035 is a permeable layer. Barrier layer 1050 is an
      impermeable layer and defines a cavity 1054 and an edge 1058 about
      its perimeter. <br>
      <br>
      [0205] Apparatus 1000 is particularly useful for applications
      where the performance of the apparatus without an envelope layer
      is sufficient because production is simplified as the step of
      constructing the envelope layer is eliminated. In addition,
      eliminating the need to provide an envelope layer to construct the
      apparatus can decrease material costs. <br>
      <br>
      [0206] The sachet layer and barrier layer can be constructed from
      any of the materials described in connection with FIGS. 1A, 1B,
      2A, 2B, 3A, 3B, 4A, 4B, 5A, 5B, 12A, 12B, 12C, 13, 14, 15, 16A and
      16B. Preferably, the sachet layer is constructed using a
      hydrophobic membrane so that the sachet layer limits the amount of
      water entering the apparatus. A currently preferred embodiment is
      an apparatus where the sachet layer is constructed from a 0.65
      micron pore size, hydrophobic polypropylene membrane sold under
      the trade designation DOHP by Millipore (Bedford, Mass.). Another
      currently preferred embodiment is an apparatus where the sachet
      layer is constructed from a polypropylene layer sold under the
      trade designation 060P1 by Cuno Incorporated (Meriden, Conn.). <br>
      <br>
      [0207] Reactant in general, preferred reactants, reactant ratios,
      and the like, are described in connection with FIGS. 1A, 1B, 2A,
      2B, 3A, 3B, 4A, 4B, 5A, 5B, 12A, 12B, 12C, 13, 14, 15, 16A and
      16B. <br>
      <br>
      [0208] FIG. 18 is a cross-sectional side view of still yet another
      exemplary embodiment of an apparatus 1104 constructed in
      accordance with the present invention. In general overview,
      apparatus 1104 includes a tubular bottle 1106, a pump mechanism
      1112 in threaded connection with the tubular bottle 1106 on a
      first end, a detachable portion 1124 in threaded connection with
      the tubular bottle 1106 on a second end, and insert 1132. <br>
      <br>
      [0209] The bottle 1106 forms a spout 1108 that forms an exterior
      thread 1109 on the first end that attaches to the pump mechanism
      1112 fixed in screw cap 1114 that forms a matching interior thread
      1111. The bottle 1106 also defines an opening 1118 on the second
      end and exterior thread 1122 for attachment to the matching,
      interior thread 1126 defined by detachable portion 1124.
      Detachable portion 1124 also is formed to define a ridge 1128
      about its interior perimeter that receives the insert 1132. <br>
      <br>
      [0210] Insert 1132 includes a barrier layer 1150, reactant 1140, a
      sachet layer 1130, and an envelope layer 1120. The barrier layer
      1150 is formed to snap into ridge 1128 and form a pressure fit so
      that it will remain in place during use and after use can be
      removed and replaced with another similarly configured insert. The
      barrier layer 1150 also is formed to define a cavity 1154 to
      receive reactant 1140 and an edge 1158 about its perimeter for
      attachment to the sachet layer 1130 and the envelope layer 1120.
      Optionally, insert 1132 can further include a second barrier layer
      adjacent to the envelope layer 1120 (not shown) as described in
      connection with FIGS. 13 and 14. <br>
      <br>
      [0211] Pump mechanism 1112 includes tubular plunger 1133 on which
      pushbutton 1131 is mounted containing a spray nozzle 1134. Also
      shown are basic components of a typical pump, such as piston 1135,
      cylindrical chamber 1136, one-way valve 1137, collar 1138, and
      intake tube 1139. Alternate pump mechanisms are known in the art,
      such as the mechanisms described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,077,549. <br>
      <br>
      [0212] Apparatus 1104 is particularly useful for use in generating
      a desired concentration of gas in a liquid, e.g., water, that can
      then be easily delivered to a desired location, e.g., a countertop
      for disinfection, via a pump mechanism. The pump mechanism can be
      removed from the spout so that the volume defined by the tubular
      bottle and detachable portion can be filled, partially or
      entirely, with a liquid, e.g., water. Detachable portion can be
      removed to attach or replace the insert 1132, so that bottle 1106,
      pump mechanism 1112, and detachable portion 1124 can be reused. <br>
      <br>
      [0213] The envelope layer, sachet layer, and barrier layer can be
      constructed from any of the materials are described in connection
      with FIGS. 1A, 1B, 2A, 2B, 3A, 3B, 4A, 4B, 5A, 5B, 12A, 12B, 12C,
      13, 14, 15, 16A, 16B, 17A and 17B. Reactant in general, preferred
      reactants, reactant ratios, and the like, are described in
      connection with FIGS. 1A, 1B, 2A, 2B, 3A, 3B, 4A, 4B, 5A, 5B, 12A,
      12B, 12C, 13, 14, 15, 16A, 16B, 17A and 17B. <br>
      <br>
      [0214] The tubular bottle and the detachable portion can be
      constructed from any material described in connection with the
      pouch and cap described in FIGS. 15, 16A and 16B. The tubular
      bottle can be formed by any method known in the art, e.g., blow
      molding or injection molding. Pump mechanism 1112 can be any pump
      mechanism known in the art. A wide variety of pump mechanisms are
      commercially available. <br>
      <br>
      [0215] FIG. 20 is a cross-sectional side view of another exemplary
      embodiment of apparatus 1310 constructed in accordance with the
      present invention. In general overview, apparatus 1310 includes an
      envelope layer 1320, a sachet layer 1330 disposed adjacent to the
      envelope layer 1320, a barrier layer 1350 disposed adjacent to the
      sachet layer 1330, reactant 1340 disposed in the volume 1354
      defined by the sachet layer 1330 and the barrier layer 1350, and
      desiccant 1341 disposed in the volume 1355 defined by the sachet
      layer 1330 and the barrier layer 1350. <br>
      <br>
      [0216] Sachet layer 1330 and envelope layer 1320, are permeable
      layers that allow passage of the initiating agent to the reactant
      1340 and release of the gas from the apparatus 1310. Barrier layer
      1350 is an impermeable layer that forms cavities 1354, 1355 to
      receive reactant 1340 and desiccant 1341, respectively. The
      barrier layer 1350 is attached to the sachet layer 1330 and the
      envelope layer 1320 by a heat or impulse seal about the perimeter
      of the cavities 1354, 1355. Optionally a second barrier layer (not
      shown) can be sealed about its perimeter adjacent to the envelope
      layer 1320. Desiccant 1341 can be used to attract any ambient
      water vapor and/or liquid water and thereby prevent or minimize
      passage of water vapor and/or liquid water to the reactant 1340
      disposed in cavity 1354 during storage and shipping. <br>
      <br>
      [0217] This embodiment is particularly useful for wet applications
      and is more resistant to premature initiation than, e.g., the
      embodiment depicted in FIGS. 12A, 12B and 12C, due to the presence
      of the desiccant. <br>
      <br>
      [0218] The envelope layer, sachet layer, barrier layer, and
      reactant can be any of those described in connection with the
      above FIGS. 1A, 1B, 2A, 2B, 3A, 3B, 4A, 4B, 5A, 5B, 12A, 12B, 12C,
      13, 14, 15, 16A, 16B, 17A, 17B, 18 and 19. In a currently
      preferred embodiment, the envelope layer is a hydrophobic
      polypropylene copolymer film sold under the designation SM700 by
      Sealed Air Corporation and has 330 holes per square inch having a
      diameter of 0.4 mm, a 6.4% perforated area, a thickness of about
      20 microns, and a water vapor transmission rate of 700
      g/m&lt;2&gt;/24 hrs, the sachet layer is extruded, 0.65 micron
      pore size, hydrophilic polypropylene membrane sold under the trade
      designation MPLC from Millipore (Bedford, Mass.) or Nylon 6,6
      membrane layer sold under the trade designation 045ZY by Cuno
      Incorporated having a thickness of between about 180 to about 240
      microns, a pore size of about 0.45 microns, and a bubble point of
      about 24.1 psi, the barrier layer is a polyethylene terephthalate
      glycol (PETG) or polyvinyl chloride (PVC) layer, the reactant
      includes sodium chlorite and citric acid, and the desiccant
      comprises molecular sieves. <br>

      [0219] Apparatus 1310 can also be incorporated into a pouch like
      that depicted in FIG. 15 to generate a desired concentration of
      gas, e.g., chlorine dioxide, in water. This embodiment is
      particularly useful in wet applications, e.g., for use in removing
      biofilm from dental equipment. One such apparatus was constructed
      and used to generate an aqueous solution containing 50 parts per
      million chlorine dioxide. It was then emptied into a dental
      equipment reservoir and allowed to run through the equipment,
      which was contaminated with biolfilm, and stand overnight. In the
      morning, the dental equipment was flushed with water. This
      procedure was repeated the following two nights. The equipment was
      then tested for the presence of biofilm and the biofilm was
      diminished. Thereafter, rinsing the equipment once daily with a 5
      parts per million solution was adequate to retard the growth of
      biofilm in the equipment. <br>
      <br>
      [0220] In view of the collective teachings and guidance set forth
      herein, the practitioner can design, fabricate, test and use any
      number of embodiments of the present invention. All that is
      required is an ordinary level of skill in the art and some routine
      experimentation. <br>
      <br>
      [0221] Another aspect of the present invention features a method
      of forming an apparatus for delivery of a gas. This method
      includes the steps of: (a) providing a multi-layer structure
      comprising a reactant layer centrally disposed between a sachet
      layer and a barrier layer, and an envelope layer disposed adjacent
      to the sachet layer; and (b) sealing the perimeter of the barrier
      layer, sachet layer and barrier layer such that the reactant is
      disposed in a volume defined by the sachet layer and the barrier
      layer. <br>
      <br>
      [0222] This method has many variations and embodiments. For
      example, a second barrier layer can be disposed adjacent to the
      envelope layer opposite the sachet layer prior to step (a).
      Another example is that in step (b) the seal can be effected by
      adhesive and/or by stamping the multi-layer structure with a hot
      die to heat-seal the layers together. <br>
      <br>
      [0223] Sealing includes any method of substantially sealing the
      envelope layer, the sachet layer and the barrier layer about their
      perimeters, e.g., sealing the perimeter with a glue or other
      sealant, impulse sealing, ultrasonic sealing and heat sealing. <br>
      <br>
      [0224] In a preferred embodiment, the apparatus is manufactured in
      an array for ease of manufacturing. This method includes: (a)
      providing a layer of impermeable material that has an array of
      cavities formed therein; (b) disposing reactant in the array of
      cavities; (c) disposing one or more permeable layer over the layer
      of impermeable material; (d) sealing the one or more permeable
      layers to the layer of impermeable material about the perimeter of
      each cavity; and (e) cutting the impermeable material and the one
      or more permeable materials about the perimeter of each cavity. <br>
      <br>
      [0225] This method is advantageous because it allows the apparatus
      of the present invention to be manufactured quickly and
      inexpensively relative to assembling and forming each individual
      sachet and envelope separately and/or manually. <br>
      <br>
      [0226] The impermeable material provided in step (a) can have an
      array of cavities formed therein, e.g., by using a thermoforming
      process to form the array of cavities. Thermoform machines
      suitable for use in accordance with the present invention include
      those manufactured by Multivac (Kansas City, Mo.), Tiromat (Avon,
      Mass.) Robert Reiser &amp; Co. (Canton, Mass.), and Ulma Packaging
      (Woodstock, Ga.). Other suitable methods for forming the array of
      cavities include vacuum forming, cold forming, mechanical forming,
      and blister or skin packing process. The reactant can be disposed
      in the array of cavities on an assembly line and the one or more
      permeable layers can be sequentially positioned over the
      impermeable material, e.g., by unwinding sheets of the one or more
      permeable layers over the impermeable layer on an assembly line.
      The one or more permeable layers can then be sealed to the
      impermeable material about the perimeter of each cavity using
      methods known in the art, e.g., adhesives, heat sealing methods,
      ultrasonic sealing methods, radio frequency sealing methods or
      impulse sealing. The impermeable material and the one or more
      permeable materials can then be cut about the perimeter of each
      cavity using methods known in the art, e.g., by using a die, to
      form an apparatus similar to those depicted in FIGS. 12A, 12B,
      12C, 13-15, 16A, 16B, 17A, 17B, 18 and 20. <br>
      <br>
      [0227] These apparatus can then be inserted into the spout of a
      pouch that has been otherwise sealed about its periphery.
      Alternatively, it can be inserted into a pouch that has not been
      sealed about its periphery and the periphery then sealed, e.g., by
      using adhesive, heat sealing methods, ultrasonic sealing methods,
      radio frequency sealing methods or impulse sealing methods.
      Optionally, the apparatus can be attached to a wall of the pouch,
      e.g., by using adhesive, heat sealing methods, ultrasonic scaling
      methods, radio frequency scaling methods or impulse sealing
      methods. <br>
      <br>
      [0228] In another aspect, the above method can be modified to
      construct an apparatus without an envelope. For example, the
      method can include the steps of: (a) providing a multi-layer
      structure comprising a reactant layer centrally disposed between a
      sachet layer and a barrier layer; and (b) sealing the multi-layer
      structure such that the such that the reactant is disposed in a
      volume defined by the sachet layer and the barrier layer <br>
      <br>
      [0229] Yet another aspect of the present invention features a
      method of delivering gas. This method includes the steps of: (a)
      providing an apparatus for delivery of a gas comprising an
      envelope layer, a sachet layer disposed adjacent to the envelope
      layer, a barrier layer disposed adjacent to the sachet layer, and
      a reactant disposed in a volume defined by the sachet layer and
      the barrier layer; and (b) disposing the apparatus in an
      environment that comprises an initiating agent. <br>
      <br>
      [0230] This method has many variations and embodiments. For
      example, the environment can be liquid and the initiating agent
      can be water or the environment can be gaseous and the initiating
      agent can be water vapor. The apparatus can further comprise a
      pouch that can be filled with a desired liquid to receive the gas
      generated. <br>
      <br>
      [0231] Optionally, to further increase stability of any of the
      apparatus of the present invention during storage and shipment,
      any desiccant, such as silica gel or molecular sieves, can be
      incorporated within the apparatus to scavenge initiating agent
      prior to use of the apparatus. <br>
      <br>
      [0232] The present invention is useful for fabrication of a gas
      delivery apparatus that is compact, cost-effective and safe.
      Furthermore, the present invention can be used for a variety of
      applications, including delivery of gas to air or water, for a
      variety of purposes including removal of biofilm, disinfection,
      deodorization, bleaching and sanitation. <br>
      <br>
      [0233] As a general rule and without wishing to be confined to any
      theory, it is expected that the amount and rate of gas release
      exhibited by apparatus of the present invention will be influenced
      by the total surface area of the permeable layer adjacent to the
      reactant, but not by the geometry of the apparatus. That is, the
      various embodiments of the present invention are expected to
      release the same volume of gas at the same rate provided that the
      total surface area of the permeable layer adjacent to the reactant
      is about equal, all other variables being held constant. It has
      been discovered that hydrotalcite, and the metal hydroxides in the
      hydrotalcite family, can be used to stabilize one or more
      reactants of the present invention. For example, hydrotalcite,
      including activated hydrotalcite, and metal hydroxides in the
      hydrotalcite family can be used to stabilized the following
      reactants and combination of these reactants: acids, aqueous
      acids, citric acid, oxalic acid, fumaric acid, phosphoric acid,
      potassium bitartate, chlorites, chlorates, sulfites, bisulfites,
      sulfates, carbonate, nitrites. While not wishing to be bound to
      any particular theory, it is believed that the basic nature and
      ability to attract and bind water and water vapor of hydrotalcite
      and its family members contribute to its ability to stabilize the
      reactants of the present invention. Basic additives are less
      likely to react with chlorites and other reactants that react with
      acid than acidic additives. In addition, the ability of
      hydrotalcite and its family members to attract, absorb, adsorb
      and/or otherwise bind water and water vapor mitigates or prevents
      premature initiation, e.g., during manufacture, shipping, and
      storage. The ability of hydrotalcite to function as a flow agent
      also is desirable because it renders the reactants more readily
      metered and dispensed during manufacture. Activated hydrotalcite,
      i.e., hydrotalcite that has been heated drive off water, has been
      found to stabilize reactants in an apparatus such as those
      described in Examples 12 and 13 for at least six months. The
      apparatus are expected to have a shelf life of at least a year. <br>
      <br>
      [0234] The mineral commonly known as hydrotalcite is the naturally
      occurring form of hydrotalcite, which has the chemical formula:
      Mg6Al2(OH)16CO3.4H2O. Hydrotalcite, suitable for use in the
      apparatus of the present invention, is commercially available from
      DIP Chemical Industries (Mumbai, India). When activated, this
      hydrotalcite is hygroscopic, in that it absorbs water vapor up to
      about 36% of its weight when exposed to about 97% relative
      humidity, and has a surface pH between about 11 and about 12. The
      hydrotalcite can be activated using known methods, e.g., by
      exposing it to high temperatures for an extended period of time,
      e.g., 500[deg.] C. for one hour, and thereafter sealing the
      hydrotalcite in a low humidity environment so that it doesn't
      deactivate prematurely. <br>
      <br>
      [0235] There also are metal hydroxides in the hydrotalcite family
      that can be used to stabilize reactants in accordance with the
      present invention. The family can be described with the general
      formula: AwBx(OH)yCz.nH2O, wherein A is a divalent metal cation, B
      is a trivalent metal cation, and C is a monovalent, divalent,
      trivalent, or tetravalent anion. The values for w, x, y, z, and n
      have the following relationship: 0 ≤z≤x≤4≤w≤{fraction (1/2)}y, and
      12≥n≥{fraction (3/2)}x. Metal cations represented by A include,
      but are not limited to, Mg&lt;2+&gt;, Ni&lt;2+&gt;, Fe&lt;2+&gt;,
      and Zn&lt;2+&gt;. Metal cations represented by B include, but are
      not limited to, Al&lt;3+&gt;, Fe&lt;3+&gt;, and Cr&lt;3+&gt;.
      Chemical species represented by C include, but are not limited to
      CO3&lt;2-&gt;, SO4&lt;2-&gt;, OH&lt;-&gt;, NO3&lt;-&gt;, and
      Cl&lt;-&gt;. One such hydrotalcite is a hydrotalcite having the
      formula: Mg4Al2(OH)12CO3.nH2O, and is commercially available from
      Alcoa World Chemicals (Leetsdale, Pa.). Other suitable minerals in
      the hydrotalcite family include pyroaurite having the formula
      Mg6Fe&lt;3+&gt;2(OH)16CO3.4H2O, and takovite having the formula
      Ni6Al2(OH)16[(CO3)0.75(OH)0.25].4H2O. Preferably, the hydrotalcite
      is added to the reactant such that the resulting mixture is
      between about 1% and about 25% hydrotalcite by weight. More
      preferably, the resulting mixture is between about 5% and about
      20% hydrotalcite by weight. <br>
      <br>
      [0236] Another aspect of the present invention is an apparatus for
      delivery of a gas including a sachet that includes a material that
      is water vapor selective, and a reactant disposed in the sachet
      that generates a gas in the presence of an initiating agent. The
      term "water vapor selective" as used herein refers to a material
      that selectively allows permeation of water vapor and
      substantially impedes permeation of liquid water. More preferably,
      the material excludes permeation of liquid water. Typically, the
      water vapor selective material is hydrophobic. The skilled
      practitioner typically refers to water vapor selective material as
      water impermeable, although water vapor can permeate the layer,
      and refers to materials that allow permeation of liquid water as
      water permeable. Suitable water vapor selective materials can be
      made from a variety of materials including, but not limited to,
      polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), polypropylene (PP), polyethylene
      (PE), and fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP). <br>
      <br>
      [0237] Water vapor selective material also is particularly
      advantageous because it substantially impedes or excludes the
      diffusion of water soluble species, such as water soluble
      reactants, additives, and reaction by-products, out of the
      apparatus. Membranes that allow liquid water permeation allow
      soluble species such as soluble reactants to permeate the
      apparatus and enter the environment. Prior attempts have been made
      to ameliorate or avoid escape of soluble species by using
      insoluble reactants or by binding or otherwise disposing the
      soluble species on insoluble materials such as clays and molecular
      sieves. This is not advantageous because it introduces additional
      steps and/or expense to the preparation of the apparatus. Thus,
      the water vapor selective materials of the present invention are
      advantageous because they impede or preclude the permeation of the
      soluble reactants, additives, and by-products, thus removing the
      need to include or generate insoluble reactants, by-products
      and/or additives. <br>
      <br>
      [0238] Water vapor selective materials also are advantageous
      because their use eliminates the need to use any further layers,
      e.g., further sachet and/or envelope layers, to retain soluble
      species in the apparatus, which also introduces additional steps
      and expense in the construction of the apparatus. <br>
      <br>
      [0239] Preferably, the water vapor selective material has a
      thickness between about 5 microns and about 400 microns thick, a
      pore size between about 0.05 microns and about 10 microns, and a
      water intrusion pressure between about 30 millibars and about
      4,000 millibars. Preferably, the water vapor selective material is
      adhered to or otherwise supported by a support layer that allows
      liquid water to permeate the support layer, and the overall
      thickness of both the water vapor selective layer and the support
      layer is between about 1 mil and 20 mils. More preferred, are
      water vapor selective materials having a thickness between about
      15 microns and about 200 microns thick, a pore size between about
      0.25 microns and about 5 microns, and a water intrusion pressure
      between about 100 millibars and about 1,500 millibars. Preferably
      this layer has a water permeable support layer such that the total
      thickness of both layers is between about 2 mils and about 10
      mils. Most preferred, are water vapor selective materials having a
      thickness between about 20 microns and about 100 microns thick, a
      pore size between about 1 micron and about 3 microns, and a water
      intrusion pressure between about 200 millibars and about 750
      millibars. Preferably this layer has a water permeable support
      layer such that the total thickness of both layers is between
      about 3 mils and about 8 mils. <br>
      <br>
      [0240] Generally, if rapid generation and release of gas is
      desired, a thinner layer is preferred because the thinner the
      layer, the more rapidly water vapor can diffuse into the apparatus
      and initiate the reaction, and the more rapidly gas can diffuse
      out of the apparatus. Conversely, if slower generation and release
      of gas is desired a thicker material is preferred, such as between
      about 5 mils and about 20 mils. Additionally or alternatively, if
      slower generation and release of gas is desired, a relatively
      smaller surface area of the material can be used. For example, a
      sachet including a rigid frame can be used to construct the sachet
      as described below and illustrated in Example 15, and one or both
      sachet layers can be constructed from a water vapor selective
      material. <br>
      <br>
      [0241] Additionally or alternatively, pore size of the water vapor
      selective layer can be selected to produce the desired release at
      specific depths of water in which the apparatus will be used. A
      smaller pore size will correspond to deeper operation by
      increasing the amount of hydraulic water pressure that the
      membrane will experience while remaining impermeable to liquid
      water. <br>
      <br>
      [0242] Water vapor selective layers suitable for use in
      constructing the apparatus of the present invention preferably
      have water vapor permeability of between about 2,000
      g/m&lt;2&gt;/24 hrs and about 150,000 g/m&lt;2&gt;/24 hrs, as
      determined by JIS L 1099-1985 (Method B), "Testing Methods for
      Water Vapour Permeability of Clothes," from the Japanese Standards
      Association. Water vapor selective layers preferably have a
      resistance to liquid water permeation of at least about 30
      millibars as determined by ISO 811-1981 "Textile
      fabrics-Determination of resistance to water
      penetration-Hydrostatic pressure test" published by the
      International Organization for Standardization. <br>
      <br>
      [0243] Optionally, the water vapor selective layer or layers of
      the present invention can include a support layer to increase the
      strength of the layer, and/or to increase its ability to bond to
      the other materials used to construct the apparatus. The support
      layer preferably allows diffusion or passage of initiating agent
      to the surface of the water vapor selective layer. For example,
      the support layer can be spun, perforated or have large pores that
      allow passage of liquid water and vapor to the surface of the
      water vapor selective layer. The support layer can be affixed to
      the water vapor selective layer by any means, for example,
      lamination, casting, co-extrusion, and/or adhesive layers.
      Preferably, the sachet is constructed so that the water vapor
      selective layer faces the interior of the sachet. The support
      layer itself can be hydrophilic and/or hydrophobic. If
      hydrophilic, the material can be used to attract and deliver
      liquid water and/or vapor to the surface of the water vapor
      selective material. Suitable support layers include, but are not
      limited to, polyethylene, polypropylene, nylon, acrylic,
      fiberglass, and polyester in the form of woven, non-woven, and
      mesh layers. Preferably, the support layer thickness is between
      about 1 mil and 20 mils. <br>
      <br>
      [0244] Suitable water vapor selective materials previously
      described herein include the 0.60 pore size, hydrophobic,
      polypropylene (PP) membrane having a thickness between about 250
      microns and about 300 microns sold under the designation 060P1 by
      Cuno Incorporated (Meriden, Conn.). Also suitable is the 0.65
      micron pore size, hydrophobic polyethylene material sold under the
      trade designation DOHP by Millipore (Bedford, Mass.) <br>
      <br>
      [0245] Another water vapor selective material, suitable for use in
      a rapid release apparatus, includes a 1.75 mil thick, hydrophobic
      polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) layer thermally bonded to a 5 mil
      thick, hydrophobic polyethylene (PE) support layer sold under the
      trade designation BHA-TEX(R) by BHA Technologies (Kansas City,
      Mo.). Its resistance to liquid water permeation is at least about
      500 millibar. <br>
      <br>
      [0246] FIG. 21 is a perspective view of yet another exemplary
      embodiment of an apparatus 1510 constructed in accordance with the
      present invention. Apparatus 1510 includes a sachet layer 1535, an
      intermediate layer 1570 disposed adjacent the sachet layer 1535,
      and a barrier layer 1550 disposed adjacent the intermediate layer
      1570. A first reactant 1540 is disposed in the volume defined by
      the barrier layer 1550 and the intermediate layer 1570, and a
      second reactant 1544 is disposed in the volume defined by the
      intermediate layer 1570 and the sachet layer 1535. <br>
      <br>
      [0247] The sachet layer can be constructed from any of the layers
      described above. Preferably, the sachet layer includes a water
      vapor selective layer and an adjacent support layer. The first
      reactant and the second reactant can be any of the reactants
      described above. The reactant or reactants can further include
      additives, such as activated hydrotalcite. The intermediate layer
      can be constructed of any of the layers described above.
      Preferably, the intermediate layer comprises a cellulose layer
      such as the Japanese paper "Tosa Tengujo" sold by Bookmakers
      (Hagerstown, Md.). The barrier layer can include any of the
      barrier layers describe above. In a preferred embodiment the
      barrier layer is constructed from a composite of a metalized
      bi-axially oriented polypropylene about 1 mil thick and a linear
      low density polyethylene about 4 mils thick. This apparatus is
      advantageous because it can be constructed by placing sheets of
      the sachet, intermediate, and barrier layers adjacent each other
      and sealing about the edges and cutting about the seal in one
      step. Optionally, a portion of the apparatus can be left unsealed
      until the volumes defined by the layers are filled with reactant
      and then sealed. Alternatively, the reactant can be layered with
      the layers and the entire periphery of the layers sealed at once.
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>[0248] Sachets Including a Rigid Frame </b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0249] In another aspect of the invention, the apparatus includes
      a sachet that includes a rigid frame defining at least one opening
      and a sachet layer disposed about the opening such that a volume
      is defined by the sachet. The rigid frame can be a rigid barrier
      layer as described above. The rigid frame also can take the form
      of a tubular member that can have any shape, such as a circular,
      oval, rectangular, or square-shaped cross section along the tube.
      If the rigid frame is tubular, at least one end preferably has a
      sachet layer disposed about it. A second sachet layer may be
      disposed about a second end of the rigid frame. Additionally or
      alternatively, any other layer that will define a closed
      receptacle for reactant, such as a barrier layer, can be disposed
      about a second end. Yet another option is to have a detachable
      member on the second end such as a threaded cap that can be
      removed, e.g., to remove and/or replace reactant and any
      additional sachets within the sachet. Sachets including rigid
      frames are advantageous because they can be fit into various
      devices, e.g., a humidifier, filter or cartridge. They also can be
      dropped in a reservoir and, depending on the materials used to
      construct the rigid frame, can sink to the bottom of a solution,
      e.g., if made with PVC, or float on top, e.g., if constructed with
      a foamed material. The apparatus can further include weighted
      materials to increase its tendency to reside at a bottom of a
      reservoir. The sachet includes one or more reactants that generate
      a gas in the presence of the initiating agent. The reactants can
      be mixed or separated by further structures, such as an additional
      sachet or an intermediate layer within the sachet as described
      herein. <br>
      <br>
      [0250] FIGS. 22A and 22B are a perspective and cross-sectional
      side view, respectively, of an exemplary embodiment of an
      apparatus 1600 including a sachet constructed in part with a rigid
      frame. The apparatus 1600, includes a first sachet 1610, a second
      sachet 1620, a first reactant 1630, and a second reactant 1640.
      The first sachet is constructed from a rigid frame 1614 that is
      cylindrical in shape and two sachet layers 1616, 1618 disposed on
      either side of the rigid frame 1614 such that the rigid frame 1614
      and the sachet layers 1616, 1618 define a closed receptacle for
      reactant. The first reactant 1630 is disposed in the first sachet
      1610, but not within the second sachet 1620. The second reactant
      1640 is disposed within the second sachet 1620. Thus, the first
      reactant 1630 is separated from the second reactant 1640 by the
      second sachet 1620. <br>
      <br>
      [0251] The rigid frame can be constructed from any rigid materials
      such as the barrier materials described above. For example, the
      rigid materials can include polyvinylchloride, polyethylene,
      polypropylene, polyester, styrene, polystyrene, polyethylene
      terephthalate, polyethylene terephthalate glycol,
      acrylobutylstyrene, polyacrylate, nylon, polyamide, and
      combinations thereof. The reactants can be any of the reactants
      described above. The reactants can be mixed or separated in
      separate volumes, e.g., sodium chlorite can be disposed in the
      first sachet and citric acid in the second sachet. Optionally the
      reactants can include additives. Preferably, one or more of the
      reactants is mixed with activated hydrotalcite. <br>
      <br>
      [0252] The sachet layers can be constructed from any of the sachet
      materials described herein. For example, the sachet layers can be
      constructed from a water vapor selective material, e.g., a PTFE/PE
      layer as described above. The sachet layers can also be
      constructed from a layer that initially allows entry of water but
      subsequently impedes the passage of water. Without wishing to be
      bound to any particular theory, it is believed that the layer
      swells upon introduction of water to the layer and that the layer
      allows passage of water until the layer swells to such an extent
      that water can no longer pass through the pores. In a currently
      preferred embodiment, the first sachet layer is constructed from a
      water vapor selective material, the second sachet layer is
      constructed from a layer that initially allows entry of water but
      subsequently impedes the passage of water, and the rigid layer is
      injection molded PVC. <br>
      <br>
      [0253] The apparatus can further include additional sachet layers
      and/or envelope layers adjacent the first and second sachet layers
      (not shown). The additional sachet layers and envelope layers can
      be constructed of any of the materials described herein. The first
      and second reactant can be any of the reactants described herein.
      The apparatus can further include additional sachets, envelopes,
      and/or reactant additives, such as desiccants, stabilizers and the
      like as described above. While preferred, the second sachet is
      optional and the reactants need not be separated in any manner. <br>
      <br>
      [0254] FIGS. 23A and 23B are a perspective and cross-sectional
      side view, respectively, of another exemplary embodiment of an
      apparatus 1700 including a sachet constructed in part with a rigid
      frame. The apparatus 1700, includes a sachet 1710, an intermediate
      layer 1750, a first reactant 1730, and a second reactant 1740. The
      sachet 1710 is constructed from a rigid frame 1714 having a square
      cross-section and two sachet layers 1716, 1718 disposed on either
      side of the rigid frame 1714 such that the rigid frame 1714 and
      the sachet layers 1716, 1718 define a closed receptacle for
      reactant. The rigid frame 1714 is bisected by the intermediate
      layer 1750, which defines a first volume 1754, and a second volume
      1758. The first reactant 1730 is disposed in the first volume
      1754, and the second reactant 1740 is disposed in the second
      volume 1758. Thus, first reactant 1730 is separated from second
      reactant 1740 by the intermediate layer. The apparatus 1700
      further includes a first envelope layer 1760 disposed adjacent the
      first sachet layer 1716, and a second envelope layer 1764 adjacent
      the second sachet layer 1718. <br>
      <br>
      [0255] The rigid frame, sachet layers, and envelope layers can be
      constructed from any of the materials described herein. For
      example, the rigid frame can be constructed from PVC, and the
      sachet layers can be constructed from a water vapor selective
      material. Optionally, one or more of the sachet layers can be
      constructed from a layer that initially allows entry of water but
      then impedes the passage of water. The apparatus can further
      include additional sachet layers and/or envelope layers adjacent
      the first and second sachet layers (not shown). The additional
      sachet layers and envelope layers can be constructed of any of the
      materials described herein. The first and second reactant can be
      any of the reactants described herein. The apparatus can further
      include additional sachets, envelopes, and/or reactant additives,
      such as desiccants, stabilizers and the like as described above.
      While preferred, the second sachet is optional and the reactants
      need not be separated in any manner. <br>
      <br>
      [0256] Sachets including a rigid frame can be constructed by any
      of the method described herein, e.g., by adhesives and/or heat
      sealing the sachet layers, and optionally envelope layers, to the
      rigid frame. Additional sachets and/or enveloped within or about
      the sachet including the rigid frame can be constructed by any
      method known in the art including those described herein. The
      intermediate layer and the rigid frame portions also can be
      attached by any of the methods described herein. Apparatus
      including such sachets can be used in any applications described
      herein, including, but not limited to, use in a conduit,
      humidifier, and in both wet or dry applications. <br>

      <b>[0257] Fluid Dispersion System for Dispersing a Gas </b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0258] Yet another aspect of the present invention is a fluid
      dispersion system for dispersing a gas. The system includes any of
      the apparatus for delivery of a gas described herein, and a fluid
      dispersion apparatus. The fluid dispersion apparatus can disperse
      liquids and/or gasses. The apparatus for delivery of a gas can be
      placed at any point of the fluid dispersion apparatus, e.g., in a
      liquid reservoir or a fluid outlet of the fluid dispersion
      apparatus, so that gas is generated and dispersed. The fluid
      dispersion apparatus can be any fluid dispersion apparatus known
      in the art, including vaporizers, humidifiers, sonicators that
      disperse fluid, atomizers, and carpet cleaners. <br>
      <br>
      [0259] FIG. 24 depicts an exemplary embodiment of a fluid
      dispersion system 1800 constructed in accordance with the present
      invention. The fluid dispersion system 1800 includes a fluid
      dispersion apparatus 1810, and a gas delivery apparatus 1820. The
      gas delivery apparatus 1820 includes a sachet 1830 and a reactant
      1840 disposed in the volume defined by the sachet 1830 that
      generates gas in the presence of an initiating agent. In this
      embodiment the fluid dispersion apparatus 1810 is a humidifier and
      the sachet is disposed in a fluid reservoir 1845. The reservoir
      contains a fluid 1850 that includes an initiating agent.
      Alternatively, the sachet can be disposed in a dispersion outlet
      as shown in FIGS. 25 and 26. <br>
      <br>
      [0260] The gas delivery apparatus 1820 can be any of the gas
      delivery apparatus described herein. For example, the sachet 1830
      can comprise two adjacent sachet layers, a barrier layer adjacent
      a sachet layer, or a rigid frame defining an opening and a sachet
      layer disposed about the opening. The sachet 1820 can also include
      further sachets, one or more envelope and/or envelope layers,
      further reactants, and additives, such as stabilizers and
      desiccants (not shown). The sachet can be affixed within the fluid
      dispersion apparatus by mechanical means, can float freely in the
      fluid reservoir, or it can include a weight or be constructed from
      material such that the sachet sinks to the bottom of the reservoir
      as shown in FIG. 24. <br>
      <br>
      [0261] The fluid dispersion apparatus 1810 includes a means of
      atomizing the fluid 1858, and an opening 1854 through which the
      atomized fluid containing the gas exits the fluid dispersion
      apparatus 1810. Means for atomizing fluids are well known. <br>
      <br>
      [0262] The fluid dispersion 1810 apparatus can be any fluid
      dispersion apparatus known in the art. The fluid dispersion
      apparatus can disperse fluid by any means, including mechanical
      means, sonication, atomization, and/or vaporization. Many such
      fluid dispersion apparatus suitable for use with the present
      invention are readily available commercially as well as to
      consumers, for example, DURACRAFT(TM) Cool Mist(TM) humidifiers
      from Honeywell Consumer Products (Framingham, Mass.), which draws
      liquid into a rapidly spinning wheel with small openings and
      disperses atomized fluid into the environment. Also suitable are
      apparatus that disperse fluid by passing air over a wick that is
      in contact with a liquid such as the Cool MoistureTM Humidifier
      made by Honeywell Consumer Products. <br>
      <br>
      [0263] In another aspect of the present invention, the fluid
      dispersion system can include a housing is provided that contains
      a gas delivery apparatus. The housing can be placed or affixed to
      a fluid dispersion apparatus outlet so that fluid exiting the
      fluid dispersion apparatus passes through the gas delivery
      apparatus so that gas and fluid exit the housing and enter the
      environment. <br>
      <br>
      [0264] FIG. 25 depicts a housing for use with a fluid dispersion
      system in accordance with the present invention. The housing 1900
      can be attached, e.g., to the fluid dispersion apparatus 1810
      depicted in FIG. 24. The housing 1900 defines an opening 1910
      defined by the housing for fluid dispersed by the fluid dispersion
      apparatus, and openings 1914, for expelling gas and fluid.
      Disposed in the housing 1900 is a sachet 1930 and a reactant 1940
      disposed in the volume defined by the sachet that generates gas in
      the presence of an initiating agent. The housing 1900 can be
      attached to the fluid outlet of any fluid dispersion apparatus and
      the sachet 1930 can be used instead of or in addition to a sachet
      in the dispersion apparatus reservoir as depicted in FIG. 24. <br>
      <br>
      [0265] FIG. 26 depicts another exemplary embodiment of a fluid
      dispersion system 2000 constructed in accordance with the present
      invention. The fluid dispersion system 2000 includes a fluid
      dispersion apparatus 2010, a housing 2020, and a gas delivery
      apparatus 2030. The gas delivery apparatus 2030 includes a sachet
      2034 and a reactant 2038 disposed in the volume defined by the
      sachet that generates gas in the presence of an initiating agent.
      In this embodiment the fluid dispersion apparatus 2000 is a
      humidifier and the sachet 2034 is disposed in the housing 2020.
      The reservoir contains a fluid 2040 that includes an initiating
      agent. <br>
      <br>
      [0266] The fluid dispersion apparatus 2010 includes a means of
      atomizing the fluid 2044, and an opening 2048 through which the
      atomized fluid containing the gas exits the fluid dispersion
      apparatus 2010 and enters the housing 2020. The housing 2020
      defines openings 2050 that allow exit of the gas and the atomized
      fluid from the housing 2020. <br>
      <br>
      [0267] The gas delivery apparatus 2030 is disposed within the
      housing and can be attached or affixed to the housing. The sachet
      includes a rigid frame 2054 defining a first opening 2056 and a
      second opening 2058. The sachet further includes a first sachet
      layer 2060 and a second sachet layer 2064 disposed about the first
      opening 2056 and the second opening 2058, respectively. The sachet
      can be affixed or removably attached to the housing by any known
      means (not shown), e.g., a snap fit. <br>
      <br>
      [0268] Alternatively, the gas delivery apparatus 2030 can be any
      of the gas delivery embodiments described herein. For example, the
      gas delivery apparatus can further include additional sachets,
      sachet layers, envelope layers, envelopes, additional reactant
      and/or additives as described herein. The gas dispersion apparatus
      can be any gas dispersion apparatus including those described
      above. <br>
      <br>
      [0269] The fluid dispersion system described herein can be used to
      sanitize, deodorize and/or reduce or eliminate bacteria in a fluid
      reservoir of the fluid dispersion apparatus, e.g., water in a
      humidifier or vaporizer. Additionally or alternatively, the system
      can be used to disperse chlorine dioxide and/or other gases into
      the environment to destroy or mask odor-causing compounds. The
      systems also could be used to disinfect the surrounding
      environment and kill or inactivate pathogens, such as anthrax,
      smallpox, tuberculosis, or legionella. <br>
      <br>
      [0270] A preferred method of deodorizing includes the steps of
      providing a fluid dispersion system as described above, and
      delivering the gas to one or more odor-causing compounds, wherein
      the gas inactivates the one or more odor-causing compounds. A
      preferred method of inactivating pathogens includes the steps of
      providing the fluid dispersion system described above and
      delivering the gas to one or more pathogens, wherein the gas
      inactivates the one or more pathogens, such as anthrax, smallpox,
      tuberculosis, or legionella. <br>
      <br>
      <b>[0271] Apparatus for Delivery of a Gas to a Reservoir and/or
        Conduit </b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0272] Yet another aspect of the present invention is a method and
      apparatus for delivery of a gas to a reservoir. The apparatus
      generally includes any apparatus for delivery of a gas described
      herein in fluid connection with a reservoir. One such apparatus is
      depicted in FIG. 18, wherein the tubular bottle 1106 is the
      reservoir, and insert 1132, disposed within tubular bottle 1106,
      is the apparatus for delivery of a gas. The gas can further be
      delivered from the reservoir to a dispersion apparatus such as the
      pump mechanism 1112, or a humidifier as shown in FIGS. 24 and 26.
      Another exemplary apparatus is depicted in FIG. 16B, wherein the
      cap 985 and spout 880 define the reservoir, and the barrier layer
      950 and sachet layer 930 define the sachet. The cap depicted in
      FIG. 16B can be coupled to a pouch as described or to a conduit
      (not shown). FIG. 27 depicts another exemplary embodiment of an
      apparatus 2100 for delivery of a gas to a reservoir. The apparatus
      2100 generally includes a sachet 2110, a reactant 2120 disposed
      within the volume defined by the sachet 2110, and a reservoir
      2130. The sachet 2110 includes a sachet layer 2112, a barrier
      layer 2114. An envelope layer 2118 is disposed adjacent the sachet
      layer 2112. Disposed in the volume defined by the sachet 2110 is a
      second sachet 2140 constructed from two sachet layers 2142, 2144,
      and a second reactant 2148 disposed in the second sachet 2140. <br>
      <br>
      [0273] The reservoir 2130 has first end adapted to couple to a
      second reservoir 2150, so that the reservoir 2130 can be detached
      from the second reservoir 2150 for removal and replacement of the
      sachet 2110, the reactant 2120, the second sachet 2140 and second
      reactant 2148. The second reservoir 2150 comprises a first end
      2152 adapted to couple to the reservoir 2130, and a second end
      2154 adapted to couple to a conduit 2160. Conduit 2160 is formed
      to define an inlet 2162 for fluid to enter reservoir 2130, and an
      outlet 2164 with tubular member 2168 for fluid to exit reservoir
      2130. <br>
      <br>
      [0274] FIG. 28 depicts yet another exemplary embodiment of an
      apparatus 2200 for delivery of a gas to a reservoir. The apparatus
      2200 includes a reservoir 2240, a first sachet 2210, a first
      reactant 2214 disposed in the volume defined by the first sachet
      2210, a second sachet 2220, and a second reactant 2224 disposed in
      the volume defined by the second sachet 2224. The first sachet
      2210 and the second sachet 2220 each are constructed from two
      adjacent sachet layers sealed about their perimeters to define a
      closed receptacle for the first reactant 2214 and the second
      reactant 2224, respectively. <br>
      <br>
      [0275] The sachets may be constructed from any of the materials
      described herein. The reactants can include any of the reactants
      described herein and can further include additives such as flow
      agents, desiccants and stabilizers. The apparatus can further
      include additional envelopes or sachets (not shown). <br>
      <br>
      [0276] The apparatus further includes a frangible pouch 2230
      disposed within the reservoir 2240, an initiating agent 2232
      disposed within the frangible pouch 2230, and a sock 2234 disposed
      about the frangible pouch 2230. The sock 2234 can be constructed
      from any material that does not impede the passage of initiating
      agent out of it and that substantially retains the frangible pouch
      2230 after it is disrupted. The sock 2234 is optional, but
      desirable when the frangible pouch is constructed of brittle
      materials, e.g., brittle plastic or glass, so that the frangible
      pouch pieces are substantially retained within the sock. Examples
      of sock materials suitable for use in accordance with the present
      invention are meshes made from polymers or natural fibers such as
      cotton or cellulose, or non-wovens such as TYVEK(R) non-woven
      materials made by DuPont Company (Wilmington, Del.) or the
      non-woven materials sold by Marubeni Corporation (Tokyo, Japan). <br>
      <br>
      [0277] The apparatus further includes a piston 2250 mounted to the
      reservoir 2240 that upon actuation disrupts the frangible pouch
      2230. Reservoir 2140 includes a first end 2244 adapted to couple
      to a conduit 2260, and a retaining layer 2248 that retains the
      sachets 2210, 2220 and the frangible pouch 2230 in the reservoir
      2140. Upon disruption of the frangible pouch 2230, the initiating
      agent 2232 is released and reaction is initiated. The sock 2234
      retains the pieces of the frangible pouch 2230. <br>
      <br>
      [0278] Many variations and alternative designs can readily be made
      without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. For
      example, the sachets can be replaced by any of the gas delivery
      apparatus described herein and/or they can be further contained in
      additional sachets or envelopes. For example, the sachets,
      frangible pouch, and sock can be enclosed within a sachet or
      envelope attached to the reservoir and the retaining layer not
      included such that the outer sachet or envelope retains the
      sachets, frangible pouch and sock in the reservoir. Any of the
      reactants described herein can be used. Reactants can be mixed or
      separated, e.g., by a sachet or an intermediate layer. Additives
      can also be included in the apparatus, such as activated
      hydrotalcite. The conduit can be any conduit, such as a beverage
      line. <br>
      <br>
      [0279] Yet another aspect of the present invention is a method of
      delivering a gas to a conduit. The method include the steps of
      providing an apparatus for delivery of a gas including a sachet
      and a reactant disposed within the volume defined by the sachet
      that generates a gas in the presence of an initiating agent, and a
      reservoir in fluid communication with the sachet. The method
      further includes the steps of coupling the apparatus to a conduit,
      and delivering a gas to the conduit by introducing an initiating
      agent to the reactant. <br>
      <br>
      [0280] The conduit can be any conduit where introduction of a gas
      is desired. Introduction of a gas, e.g., chlorine dioxide, is
      particularly useful when it is desired to sanitize, disinfect,
      remove biofilms, and/or kill, inhibit or inactivate pathogens in
      an aqueous fluid, gas or liquid. The apparatus can be used to
      flush and clean out conduits between regular usage or to introduce
      chlorine dioxide gas during regular usage. The conduit can be a
      food or beverage conduit, such as a beverage line in a beverage
      dispensing machine, a conduit in equipment used to make food or
      beverages, or a water line in a water dispenser such as a fountain
      or bubbler. The conduit can be part of a dental apparatus such as
      a water line. The conduit can be part of a medical apparatus, such
      as an analyzer. The conduit can be a conduit in a commercial or
      household appliance such as a dishwasher or coffeemaker. <br>

      </b><b> An Apparatus in Accordance with the Present Invention </b><br>
      <br>
      [0281] A membrane sachet was constructed by impulse scaling the
      perimeter of two 3 cm*3 cm sheets of 0.65 micron pore hydrophilic
      polypropylene membrane sold under the trade designation MPLC
      obtained from Millipore (Bedford, Mass.). The sheets were impulse
      sealed a 16'' TISH400 Impulse Sealer available from TEW Electric
      Heating Equipment Corporation (Taiwan). This sachet was filled
      with 50 mg of sodium chlorite and 200 mg citric acid. The sachet
      was then placed into an envelope formed by impulse sealing the
      perimeter of a 4 cm*6 cm perforated film. The perforated film used
      was a SM700 Cryovac(R) perforated film from Sealed Air Corporation
      (Duncan, S.C.). This assembly was then placed in a 1 liter plastic
      bag filled with water for 15 minutes. The chlorine dioxide
      concentration in the water was measured using a Beckman DU-520
      UV-Vis Spectrophotometer set at a wavelength of 360 [lambda] at
      about 6 mg/L. <br>

      mg of sodium chlorite, 60 mg of activated hydrotalcite, and 1,200
      mg citric acid. The barrier layer was formed from polyvinyl
      chloride to define a barrier layer similar to barrier layer 50
      depicted in FIGS. 12A, 12B and 12C. It had an outside a diameter
      of 6 cm and a 0.5 cm deep cavity formed therein having a 4.8 cm
      inside diameter. The layers were sealed about the edge of the
      barrier layer with an epoxy adhesive between the impermeable layer
      and the nylon 6,6 membrane layer, and between the nylon 6,6
      membrane layer and the perforated film layer. The surface area of
      the nylon 6,6 layer adjacent to the reactant was about 18 cm&lt;2
      &gt;and the volume defined by the barrier layer and the nylon 6,6
      layer was about 9 cm&lt;3&gt;. This assembly was attached by a
      snap fit to the interior wall of a polypropylene cap having a
      threaded fit to the spout of a 1 liter blow molded high density
      polyethylene plastic bottle. The bottle was filled with 1 liter of
      water, sealed with the cap, and turned upside down and left to
      stand. The chlorine dioxide concentration in the water was
      measured using a Hach DR890 Colorimeter and the standard Hach
      chlorine dioxide method at about 25 mg/L at 45 minutes and about
      42 mg/L at 60 minutes. Hach Colorimeters are available from Hach

      [0291] An exemplary apparatus will be constructed as described in
      Example 9, except that this assembly will be fused to the interior
      wall of a one liter pouch. The pouch will be constructed from a 5
      mil thick impermeable layer comprising a polyester exterior, a

      sealing layer obtained from Sealed Air Corporation (Duncan, S.C.).
      This layer has a water vapor transmission rate of 0.01 g/100
      in2/24 hours at 70% relative humidity and 122[deg.] F. The spout
      will be constructed of injection molded polypropylene. The pouch
      will be sealed about its perimeter except for the opening defined
      by the spout. The one liter pouch will then be filled with water,
      capped, and allowed to stand. The chlorine dioxide concentration
      in the water will be measured as described in Example 9 and
      similar chlorine dioxide concentrations are expected at 45 and 60
      minutes. Such an apparatus and exemplary use of the same are

      <b>EXAMPLE 12 </b><b><br>
      </b><b> Apparatus Having Reactants Mixed with Hydrotalcite </b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0292] Hydrotalcite, obtained from Alcoa World Chemicals
      (Leetsdate, Pa.), was activated by disposing the hydrotalcite on a
      tray in a layer not more than 1 inch thick, and placing the tray
      in a furnace at 500[deg.] C. for one hour. The hydrotalcite was
      stored in a closed, airtight container. The hydrotalcite was
      weighed before and after activation, and demonstrated an
      approximately 40% weight loss, believed to be attributable to loss
      of water and carbon dioxide in the furnace. Dry, flaked technical
      sodium chlorite (80%) obtained from Vulcan Chemical (Birmingham,
      Ala.), was ground to a mesh particle size range between about 35
      mesh and 70 mesh using a mechanical impact milling system
      (particle size ranged between about 212 microns and 500 microns).
      The activated hydrotalcite was mixed with the ground sodium
      chlorite to form a mixture of about 80% sodium chlorite and about
      20% activated hydrotalcite by weight. The sodium
      chlorate/hydrotalcite mixture was then mixed in a dry environment
      (71[deg.] F., 40% relative humidity) with desiccated granular
      citric acid having a particle size range between about 25 mesh and
      about 60 mesh. The citric acid was desiccated by exposing it to
      dry air (less than 40% relative humidity for a period of 24 hours
      with frequent mixing. The resulting mixture was approximately 80%
      citric acid and 20% sodium chlorite/hydrotalcite mixture by
      weight. <br>
      <br>
      [0293] Approximately 1.75 grams of this mixture was sealed in a
      sachet. The sachet and a 1 gram molecular sieve desiccant were
      sealed in a 1 liter plastic bag measuring approximately 7.5 inches
      by 9 inches constructed from a composite of a 1 mil thick
      metallized biaxially oriented polypropylene film and a 5 mils
      thick linear low density polyethylene film. The bag was sealed
      with a polypropylene spout and cap. The apparatus was stored at
      room temperature, which ranged from about 68[deg.] F. to about
      80[deg.] F., and ambient humidity, which ranged from about 50%
      relative humidity to about 90% relative humidity. The apparatus
      was stable at 6 months in that no reaction between the sodium
      chlorite and the citric acid was detected at 6 months. <br>

      [0294] The reactants and hydrotalcite described in Example 12 were
      obtained. The sodium chlorite was ground, the hydrotalcite
      activated, and the citric acid desiccated, as described in Example
      12. A mixture of approximately 95% sodium chlorite and 5%
      activated hydrotalcite by weight was made. Approximately 4.3 grams
      of this mixture was sealed in a first sachet, and approximately 20
      grams of desiccated citric acid was sealed in a second sachet.
      These two sachets were sealed in a 5[1/2] inch by 3[1/2] inch
      envelope constructed from hydrophobic, polypropylene non-woven
      membrane sold under the designation 060P1 by Cuno Incorporated
      (Meriden, Conn.). The sachets and envelope, and 2 grams of
      molecular sieves desiccant were sealed in a 2-liter plastic bag
      measuring approximately 7.5 inches by 14 inches constructed from a
      composite of a 1 mil thick metallized biaxially oriented
      polypropylene film and a 5 mils thick linear low density
      polyethylene film. The bag was sealed with a polypropylene spout
      and cap. The apparatus was stored under the same conditions as
      described in Example 12. The apparatus was stable at 6 months in
      that no reaction between the sodium chlorite and the citric acid
      was detected at 6 months. <br>

      </b><b> Apparatus Having a Sachet Constructed from Water Vapor
        Selective Material </b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0295] Six sets of reactant/hydrotalcite mixtures were each
      prepared for inclusion in a sachet as follows: 350 grams of a
      mixture of approximately 80% sodium chlorite obtained from Vulcan
      Chemical (Birmingham, Ala.) and 20% activated hydrotalcite
      obtained from Alcoa World Chemicals (Leetsdale, Pa.), was mixed
      with 1400 milligrams of desiccated citric acid from JT Baker
      (Phillipsburg, N.J.). <br>
      <br>
      [0296] Four of the reactant/hydrotalcite mixtures were each
      impulse sealed in a sachet constructed from two 1.75 mils thick,
      2.5 inch by 2.5 inch hydrophobic polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)
      layers having a 1.5 micron average nominal pore size thermally
      bonded to a 5 mil thick, BHA-TEX(R) hydrophobic polyethylene (PE)
      support layer from BHA Technologies (Kansas City, Mo.). The
      remaining two reactant/hydrotalcite mixtures were each impulse
      sealed in a sachet constructed from two 2.5 inch by 2.5 inch, 0.65
      micron pore size, extruded hydrophobic polypropylene layer sold
      under the trade designation DOHP by Millipore (Bedford, Mass.). <br>
      <br>
      [0297] Each of the six total sachets were sealed in a 1 liter
      plastic bag filled with water. The chlorine dioxide concentration
      in the water was measured every 10 minutes using a Hach DR890
      Colorimeter and the standard Hach chlorine dioxide method. FIG. 29
      is a graph depicting chlorine dioxide concentration versus time
      comparing the above sachet materials. The square-shaped data
      points correspond to the averaged values for the apparatus
      constructed with the PTFE/PE sachet layers. The circle-shaped data
      points correspond to averaged values for apparatus constructed
      with the PP sachet layers. As can be seen from FIG. 29, the
      apparatus having the PTFE/PE sachet generated chlorine dioxide
      more rapidly than the apparatus with the PP sachet. This due, at
      least in part, to use of a thinner PTFE water vapor selective
      material, as compared to the relatively thicker PP water vapor
      selective material. In addition, the apparatus having the PTFE/PE
      sachet generated more chlorine dioxide, resulting in a more highly
      concentrated solution than the solution generated by the apparatus
      with the PP membrane. <br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 15 </b><b><br>
      </b><b> Apparatus Having a Rigid Frame </b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0298] A rigid frame of PVC pipe, cylindrical in shape and
      measuring about 2.54 cm in length, having an inner diameter of
      about 3.81 cm, and an inner volume of about 29 cm&lt;3 &gt;was
      obtained. The first end was sealed with the PTFE/PE layer used in
      the preceding example. A mixture of approximately 95% sodium
      chlorite and 5% activated hydrotalcite by weight was made as
      described in Example 13. About 2.9 grams of the mixture was
      enclosed in a sachet measuring 1.5 inches square, and made of heat
      sealable water soluble paper made by Mishima Paper Co. (Tokyo,
      Japan). The sachet and about 13.6 grams of desiccated citric acid
      were disposed in the vessel formed from the rigid frame and the
      PTFE/PE sachet layer, and a second layer of the same PTFE/PE
      sachet material was sealed on the second end of the rigid frame,
      thus forming a substantially closed sachet volume of about 29
      cm&lt;3&gt;. The layers were sealed to the rigid frame by using
      Scotch(R) 300LSE Hi Strength adhesive made by the 3M Company
      (Minneapolis, Minn.). The membrane/adhesive/rigid frame bond was
      allowed to cure for 24 hours prior to use. The resulting apparatus
      was placed in about 2 liters of water. After 24 hours, the
      chlorine dioxide concentration was measured using a Hach DR890
      Colorimeter and the standard Hach chlorine dioxide method. The
      chlorine dioxide concentration was about 346.7 ppm. <br>

      obtained from Vulcan Chemicals (Birmingham, Ala.), and 5%
      activated hydrotalcite obtained from Alcoa World Chemicals
      (Leetsdale, Pa.), were sealed in a 2.75 inch*2.75 inch sachet made
      of heat sealable water soluble paper made by Mishima Paper Co.
      (Tokyo, Japan). 20 grams of desiccated citric acid monohydrate
      obtained from J. T. Baker (Phillipsburg, N.J.), were sealed inside
      a second sachet, measuring 3.25 inches*4 inches, also made of rice
      paper. These two sachets were then sealed inside a hydrophobic
      envelope having dimensions of 4.75 inches*4 inches. <br>
      <br>
      [0300] Sixty-seven sets of reactant sachets impulse sealed in a
      water vapor selective envelope constructed of a non-woven
      polypropylene membrane sold under the trade designation S8500240H
      by Cuno Incorporated (Meridan, Conn.). The remaining three sets of
      reactant sachets were scaled, using Scotch(TM) 300LSE Hi Strength
      Adhesive (3M Corporation, Minneapolis, Minn.), in a water vapor
      selective envelope constructed of a 1.75 mil thick PTFE layers
      thermally bonded to a 5 mil thick polyethylene (PE) mesh support
      material resulting in a final envelope material thickness of
      approximately 5 mils which is sold under the trade designation
      BHA-TEX(R) by BHA Technologies (Kansas City, Mo.). The envelopes
      were constructed with the PTFE layer on the inside, near the
      reactant sachets, and the adhesive was allowed to cure for 24
      hours prior to testing. <br>
      <br>
      [0301] Each of the seventy envelopes was sealed in a 2-liter
      plastic bag that was filled with liquid water. The chlorine
      dioxide concentration in the water was measured periodically, over
      a 24-hour period, using a Hach DR890 Colorimeter and the standard
      Hach chlorine dioxide method. FIG. 30 is a graph depicting the
      chlorine dioxide concentration versus time comparing the above
      envelope materials. The diamond-shaped data points correspond to
      the averaged values for the apparatus constructed with the
      non-woven polypropylene envelope material. The square-shaped data
      points correspond to the averaged values for the apparatus
      constructed with the PTFE/PE composite envelope material. As can
      be seen from FIG. 30, the apparatus having the PTFE/PE envelope
      generated chlorine dioxide more rapidly than the apparatus with
      the polypropylene envelope. <br>
