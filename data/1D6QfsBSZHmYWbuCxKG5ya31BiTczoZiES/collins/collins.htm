          <br>
          Several years ago Mr Brian Collins began a project to design
          an efficient multi-fueled engine. During the course of
          development a unique air/fuel induction system was designed,
          and is now known as the 'Collins Cycle'. This cycle is the
          principle which enables the Collins Engine to utilize
          efficiently many different fuels.<br>
          <br>
          The first engine to incorporate Collins Cycle was a 700 cc
          four chambered Mark 1 model. The Collins Cycle radically
          altered the traditional engine design by eliminating&nbsp;
          valves and associated parts; in fact, the engine has only five
          moving parts.<br>
          <br>
          The operating performance of the MK1 has been remarkable. A
          prototype engine, lacking sophistication and requiring
          optimizing to realize its full potential, will start
          instantaneously on a variety of fuels, idle and accelerate
          effortlessly from 250 rpm - 3000 rpm, and&nbsp; has run for
          many accumulated hours without the slightest problem. An
          emission test conducted while the MK1 engine was running LPG
          produced a carbon monoxide emission level too minute be
          recorded on the test equipment.<br>
          <br>
          A miniature 16 cc version was built to investigate the
          feasibility of adapting the Collins Engine concept into a very
          small mechanical unit, particularly suited to a handheld power
          source application.<br>
          <br>
          A third engine, a 2 liter MK II similar to the MK I but fitted
          with an integrated lubrication and cooling as installed in a
          vehicle in April 1979.<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;"> Operating Principle</span><br
            style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          The Collins engine is a four-firing system, utilizing a
          breakthrough in efficient combustion technology known as the
          Collins Cycle, whereby four chambers produce the equivalent
          work output as that of a conventional 8-cylinder engine.<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">Engine Components</span><br>
          <br>
          The engine consists of a circular aluminum alloy block, four
          junk heads, four firing chambers and an orbiting yoke mounted
          on a single-throw crankshaft.<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">Engine Description</span><br>
          <br>
          The junk heads are inserted from the outside, into the open
          ends the cylindrical firing chambers. These low mass firing
          chambers reciprocate in cast iron-lined bores, machined rain
          the engine block, in one plane, at 90 degrees to each other.<br>
          <br>
          The motion of the chambers is controlled by a unique sliding
          connection to a square orbiting yoke which is journaled to the
          crankshaft. It should be noted that, when the junk head is
          positioned in the firing chamber, and located on the block,
          the important pumping chamber is formed.<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">Lubrication</span><br>
          <br>
          The MK II engine is lubricated oil, pumped from a reservoir,
          through ducted oil ways in the crankshaft<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">Balancing</span><br
            style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          It is a straightforward operation to balance the engine
          internally, and a turbine-like smoothness.<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">Cooling</span><br
            style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          The MK II version has a standard integrated liquid cooling
          system consisting of a water pump, radiator and
          thermostatically controlled fan. Due to the engine's
          particular design, adiabatic cooling effect takes place when a
          charge of air is drawn into the pumping chamber at each cycle,
          and forced through the air transfer ports into the firing
          chamber. This adiabatically co led air swirls around in the
          inner walls of the chamber, assisting to absorb the residual
          heat after each firing cycle.<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">How the Engine Operates</span><br
            style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          A clean charge of air is pumped into the hemispherical firing
          chamber every cycle, forcing the expended charge out of the
          ported system.<br>
          <br>
          The fuel is injected into the incoming turbulent air stream
          producing an excellent air/fuel mix.<br>
          <br>
          The air/fuel mixture is fired by centrally located spark plug,
          producing an ideal flame propagation, which results in a clean
          burn.<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fuels</span><br
            style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          A particular feature of the engine is its ability run on a
          variety of fuels, including natural gas, liquid petroleum gas,
          hydrogen, petrol, diesel, grain alcohol, and methane.<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ignition</span><br
            style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          Ignition is by a standard coil and electronic distributor the
          spark plugs, situated in the center of the junk heads. The
          junk heads can be adjusted to vary the compression ratio from
          6:1, to 18:1. The spark plugs may be replaced with diesel
          injectors for compression ignition.<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">Other Design Features &amp;
            Advantages</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          Perhaps the Collins Engine's most important feature is its
          simplicity. The engine consists of five major moving parts and
          a crankshaft, utilizing largely conventional automotive type
          components, for example, standard rings and bearings. In
          addition, all wearing surfaces employ known technology.<br>
          <br>
          The design eliminates the problems of a valve train with its
          associated machining costs, engine timing problems and noise
          factors.<br>
          <br>
          The engine can be manufactured on conventional machine tools
          requiring minimum supervision and in approximately half the
          time required to manufacture a conventional 8-cylinder engine.<br>
          <br>
          During the course of the engine's operation, it produces large
          volumes of compressed air that may be used for brakes, air
          motors, and other pneumatic control systems.<br>

            Engine</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          The Collins Engine MK I, 700 cc capacity, operates basically
          on the pressure scavenged 2-stroke principle. Four cylinders
          or combustion chambers are mounted radially around the engine
          body; the pistons are static, being integral with the head
          reciprocating member comprising the firing chamber and shoe;
          power is transmitted to a single throw crankshaft through an
          orbiting yoke; each power chamber is self-contained. <br>
          <br>
          Normal aspiration induces a charge of air through a reed
          valve, into a mixing void around a cylinder ( volume being 50%
          in excess of the swept volume ); on closing of the reed valve,
          pressure develops prior to uncovering of the charging port,
          pressure charging and scavenging the firing chamber.<br>
          <br>
          Conventional piston rings are employed throughout where
          pressure sealing is required.<br>

          Inventor: COLLINS BRIAN S<br>
          EC: F01B1/06B // F01B1/06K4 // F01B13/06B<br>
          IPC: F01B1/06 // F01B13/06 // F01B15/02<br>
          <br>
          This invention relates to a rotary engine.<br>
          <br>
          In particular the invention relates to an engine of the form
          disclosed in Australian Document No. 466936.<br>
          <br>
          In one form the invention resides in a displacement engine
          comprising a substantially cylindrical housing, a rotor
          rotatably mounted in said housing on an axis parallel with the
          longitudinal central axis of the housing, a plurality of
          tubular elements each slidably mounted over fixed piston
          elements projecting substantially radially inwardly from the
          housing, said tubular elements being closed at their inner
          ends and held at their inner end in slidable and/or rolling
          engagement with the circumferential outer surface of the
          rotor, said rotor being such as to cause reciprocation of the
          tubular elements over the piston elements upon the rotation of
          the rotor, such that the volume of the space defined by the
          interior of the tubular member and the piston element varies
          with the rotation of the rotor; the wall of the housing
          surrounding each side of each piston element being such as to
          define a slot such that the side walls of the tubular element
          are sealingly and slidably engaged in the slot, wherein a
          pumping space formed between the walls of the tubular element
          and the sides of the slot being of variable volume with the
          reciprocation of the tubular element and being provided with a
          fluid inlet port in the housing and a port through the
          cylinder at least one of which, with the reciprocation of the
          tubular element, opens into the space defined between the
          interior of the tubular member and the piston to pump fluid
          into that space.<br>
          <br>
          The invention will be more fully understood in the light of
          the following description of one specific embodiment. The
          description is made with reference to the accompanying
          drawings of which:<br>
          <br>
          <b>FIG. 1 is a sectional elevation of an engine according to
            the embodiment along line 1--1 of FIG. 2; and;</b><b><br>

          </b><b>FIG. 2 is a sectional elevation along 2--2 of FIG. 1</b>.<br>
          <br>
          <img alt="" src="us2.jpg" height="631" width="333"><br>
          <br>
          The embodiment shown in the drawings comprises a housing 11
          having a number of circumferentially inwardly radially
          directed piston elements 13 mounted to its inner surface. Each
          piston element 13 has a cylinder 15 mounted thereon for
          sliding radial reciprocating movement on the piston element.
          The formation of the piston elements 13 in the housing 11 is
          such that the walls of the housing extend radially inwardly
          around the periphery of the piston element to define a slot 17
          having the form of an annular cavity around the piston
          elements 13 and having the same transverse configuration as
          the piston element 13. The inner walls of the cylinder 15 are
          sealingly engaged on their inner curved surfaces by the piston
          element 13. The open end of the cylinders 15 are provided with
          outwardly extending flanges 21 which sealingly and slidably
          engage the outer wall of the slots 17.<br>
          <br>
          The piston element 13 is formed such that it is separable from
          the casing and is provided with an axial passage for
          accommodating a spark plug 41 at its inner end. The electrodes
          of the spark plug have direct communication with the
          combustion chamber formed between the interior of the cylinder
          15 and the piston 13. The axial passageway opens to the
          exterior of the piston to permit access to the spark plug for
          servicing.<br>
          <br>
          The inner end of the cylinder 15 is slidably mounted to the
          periphery of a rotor 43 which is substantially square in shape
          and is rotatably mounted on an eccentric crankshaft 45 which
          is rotatably mounted in the casing on an axis substantially in
          alignment with the casings central longitudinal axis whereby
          with rotation of the crankshaft the rotor executes an orbital
          motion within the casings.<br>
          <br>
          As mentioned the cylinders 15 are formed at their open ends
          with an outwardly directed annular flange 21, the outer edge
          of which sealingly engages the outer wall of the slot 17. At
          the upper end of the slot 17 the outer wall thereof at the
          region adjacent the top of the piston and above, has a reduced
          diameter portion 47 such that the outer walls of the cylinder
          15 are sealingly engaged thereby. As a result the intermediate
          spaced A formed between the flange 21, the outer wall of the
          cylinder 15 and the reduced diameter portion 47 of the outer
          wall of the slot 17 is of variable volume as the cylinder 15
          reciprocates in the slot 17. This intermediate space A is in
          communication with an air supply through a one way valve 30
          and intake port 29 (see FIG. 2) and periodically with the
          interior of the combustion chamber B through a feed port 35
          formed through the wall of the cylinder 15 (see FIG. 1). Such
          periodic communication occurs when the cylinder has approached
          almost the end of its upstroke, the intermediate space A is at
          its minimal volume and the combustion chamber B is at its
          maximum volume. The combustion chamber B exhausts the spent
          gases through a port 37 provided in the wall of the cylinder
          15 and which also opens to an exhaust port 31 formed in the
          housing 11 when the cylinder 15 is approaching the end of its
          upstroke (see FIG. 2). A further port 53 is provided in the
          wall of the cylinder 15 which opens to a mating port 51 in the
          housing 11 when the cylinder is at the end of its upstroke.<br>
          <br>
          Lubrication for the movement of cylinders 15 in the slots 17
          and the sliding of the inner ends of the cylinders 15 on the
          rotor 43 is effected by a periodic supply of lubricant from an
          oil sump 19.<br>
          <br>
          Lubricant for the engine is pumped from the oil sump 19,
          mounted to the underside of the casing, to an axial passage 23
          formed in the crankshaft 45. The axial passage 23 opens into a
          radial passage 25 in the crankshaft which with rotation of the
          crankshaft 45 periodically communicates with four equally
          rotationally spaced radial passage ways 26 formed in the rotor
          43 which in turn open onto one of the faces of the rotor 43.
          The opening of each radial passage 26 in the rotor is located
          such that with reciprocation of the cylinder 15 on the rotor
          the radial passage 25 periodically communicates with a further
          passage 27 formed in the cylinder which opens into the space
          between the adjacent surfaces of the cylinder 15 and the slot
          17. A drainage passage 28 permits the drainage of lubricant
          into the rotor space and sump 19. The openings of the
          passageway 27 onto the opposed surfaces of the cylinder 15 and
          slot 17 comprise a series of openings spaced around both faces
          of the cylinder 15 and opening into a slot formed in both
          faces. The slot in both faces supports an oil ring (not shown)
          which controls the flow of lubricant such that only a thin
          film of lubricant is introduced onto the opposed faces of the
          cylinder 15 and slot 17. By means of this arrangement a supply
          of lubricant is delivered onto the opposed faces of the
          cylinder 15 and the slot 17 and between the opposed faces of
          the inner end of the cylinder 15 and the rotor 43.<br>
          <br>
          The action of the motor will be described from a point where
          the volume of the combustion chamber B is at a minimum volume
          (i.e. ignition). During the expansion of the combustion
          chamber the space A defined between the walls and the flange
          21 of the cylinder and the exterior wall of the slot 17 is
          reduced and the air which was introduced through the port 29
          in the casing and one way valve 30 is compressed until, when
          the cylinder is at the lower reaches of its stroke the air is
          permitted to flow into the combustion chamber B from the space
          A just after the exhaust gases have been vented away through
          ports 37 and 31 in the cylinder and casing respectively. The
          entry of the air from the space A into the combustion chamber
          B serves to scavange the remaining exhaust gases from the
          combustion chamber while the cooling caused by the expansion
          of the air in the combustion chamber serves in cooling the
          combustion chamber. At the bottom of its downward stroke a
          quantity of fuel is injected into the combustion chamber B
          through ports 51 and 53 in the casing and cylinder
          respectively whereupon the cylinder begins its upward stroke
          to ignition and more air is drawn into the intake space A.<br>
          <br>
          However while the invention has been described in terms of a
          two stroke cycle the engine is equally applicable to a four
          stroke cycle.<br>
          <br>
          In order to reduce the problems of wear the interior
          cylindrical face of the cylinder may be provided with a wear
          resistant liner while the exterior face of the slot 17 which
          is in sliding engagement with the external face of the
          cylinder may also be provided with a wear resistant liner. The
          provision of such a liner facilitates the manufacture of the
          components by casting without the need for machining or
          hardening of faces of the components.<br>
          <br>
          The piston 13 is removable via a head structure 59 which is
          separable from the casing 11. The head structure has formed
          within it, a cavity 61 for the flow of coolant through the
          head structure 59.<br>
          <br>
          The space C defined in the slot 17 by the edge of the piston
          13 is of variable volume with the reciprocation of the
          cylinder 15 over the piston 13. This space C may be used as a
          pumping space for pumping lubricant between the corresponding
          spaces of each cylinder. Alternatively this space C may be
          used as an air compressor to provide a forced air supply to
          the inlet port 29 for the air intake space A.<br>
          <br>
          It should be appreciated that the scope of the invention need
          not be limited to the particular scope of the embodiment
          described herein. In addition the invention is applicable to
          any engine incorporating a reciprocating cylinder and static
          piston and need not be restricted to those of the form
          disclosed in Australian Pat. No. 466936.<br>

          The present invention relates to an engine similar to the
          engine described and shown in the statement of Australian
          Patent No. 466,936.<br>
          <br>
          The engine of the invention comprises a casing substantially
          cylindrical rotor mounted in the housing and rotating about an
          axis parallel to that of the housing, a plurality of tubular
          elements which interact with mobile or fixed-organs s'
          extending radially inwardly of the housing and acting as a
          piston the tubular elements being closed at one of their ends
          and bonded to the same ends, the rotor so that each tubular
          element can slide relative to a fixed member so the volume
          delimited by the inside of a tubular element and the
          corresponding fixed member varies with the rotation of the
          rotor, stationary members each having an annular groove in
          which slides the blind open end of the tubular element
          corresponding forming two other variable volumes including a
          pump, the passages and conduits of the intake and exhaust is
          also suitable provided in the housing, the tubular elements
          and the fixed components.<br>

          <br>
          <img alt="" src="fr2.jpg"><br>
          <br>
          The engine shown in the drawing comprises a circular housing
          11 provided at its periphery and extending radially inwardly
          of the casing, a number of bodies 13, in this case four, based
          acting pistons.<br>
          <br>
          Each member 13 cooperates with a tubular member 15
          corresponding to a movable cylinder slidable relative to
          alternative member 13.<br>
          <br>
          Each member 13 comprises a first tubular portion 13a central
          (eg cylinder) having one end 13b (toward the center) and a
          closed end provided with a flange 13c on the basis of an end
          of a second tubular portion 13d in two parts 17 and 47, part
          47 having a shoulder. inside.<br>
          <br>
          Each tubular member 15 (acting as a cylinder) comprises a tube
          closed at one 15a of its ends, 15b, the other end being
          provided with a collar 21.<br>
          <br>
          The inner surface of the tube 15a slides sealing in the first
          tubular portion 13a of central member 13 so that the side face
          of the flange 21 slides simultaneously, also tightly, in the
          second tubular portion 13d of the member 13.<br>
          <br>
          With this arrangement is delimited between a body 13 and a
          tubular element 15, three different volumes variables<br>
          <br>
          - An annular space between a face C of the collar 21, the
          first and second tubular portions 13a and 13d, and the flange
          13c;<br>
          <br>
          - A volume B between the closed end 13b of the central tubular
          part 13a and the inner surface of the tube 15a, and<br>
          <br>
          - An intermediate space A between the other side of the collar
          21, the second tubular portion 13d and the outer surface of
          the tube 15a.<br>
          <br>
          A spark plug 41 is mounted on the wall 13b closing the extreme
          interior of the first tubular portion 13a, the electrodes of
          spark plug lead in zone B. Thanks to the tubular configuration
          of the member 13 the plug 41 is accessible from outside the
          housing 11.<br>
          <br>
          The closed portion 15b of each tube 15 is connected at 22 to a
          rotor 43 (square outer shape if it has four tubular elements)
          rotating on a pin 45 of a crankshaft 46, crank pin whose axis
          is parallel to that of the housing.<br>
          <br>
          The tubular elements 15 are therefore entrafnés and animated
          by a reciprocating: Volumes A, B and C therefore vary
          dependent manner.<br>
          <br>
          The link 22 is provided by a pad 23 secured to the tube 15 and
          slide in a groove 24 formed in the rotor 43. Alternatively,
          the shoe 23 can be replaced by a roller.<br>
          <br>
          The intermediate space A communicates, via an intake pipe 29
          provided with a valve 30 with a source delivering air and
          depending on the position of a tubular element 15, with the
          volume chamber B through a passage 35 formed in the side wall
          of tube 15a.<br>
          <br>
          The introduction of air occurs when the element 15 is
          approaching the end of its stroke (bottom dead center, that is
          to say, the farthest from the center), volume B is then almost
          maximum and A volume almost minimal.<br>
          <br>
          The combustion gases escape through a passage 37 formed in the
          side wall of the tube 15a and a pipe 31 passing through the
          part 47 and the housing 11.<br>
          The portion 37 and the pipe 31 are connected when the tubular
          member 15 is adjacent the bottom dead center.<br>
          <br>
          Another passage 51 is formed in the wall of the tube 15a and
          communicates, also in the vicinity of bottom dead center, with
          a channel 53 work side part 47 and the housing 11.<br>
          <br>
          By the passage 51 and the pipe 53, a quantity of fuel is then
          injected. Then air is introduced into the chamber A.<br>
          <br>
          The explosion occurred when the volume is minimal B (top dead
          center).<br>
          <br>
          When A decreases the volume relaxation and air in this volume
          (Introduced by line 29) is compressed to near the bottom dead
          center where it is blown into the combustion chamber (maximum
          volume B) just after the exhaust gas passage 37 and the pipe
          31.<br>
          <br>
          The supply air sweeps the residual exhaust gas.<br>
          <br>
          The foregoing description is made on a combustion engine in
          two stages.<br>
          <br>
          The invention can also be applied to an internal combustion
          engine with four-stroke or other types of motor, for example a
          compressed air motor.<br>
          <br>
          To minimize the problem of friction portions of the tubular
          member 15 in contact with the wear of the member 13
          corresponding provision was made liners 55 and 57.<br>
          <br>
          It possible to envisage a molding manufacturing and possibly
          avoid machining and thermal treatment that would otherwise be
          necessary.<br>
          <br>
          The volume C can be used to pump lubricant-parties acting on
          contact élément 15 and member 13.<br>
          <br>
          In other cases, the volume C can be used to compress the air
          we then have a compressor that injects air (line 29) in the
          volume A.<br>
          <br>
          The invention can be applied to any machine comprising a
          piston cooperating with a cylinder and is not limited to the
          type of engine described in Australian Patent No. 466,936.<br>

          THIS INVENTION relates to a rotary internal combustion engine.<br>
          <br>
          In one form the invention resides in an internal combustion
          engine comprising a substantially cylindrical housing, a rotor
          rotatably mounted in said housing on an axis parallel to the
          longitudinal central axis of the housing; a plurality of
          tubular elements each slidably mounted over fixed piston
          elements projecting substantially radially inwardly from the
          housing, said tubular elements being closed at their inner
          ends and held at their inner end in slidable and/or rolling
          engagement with the circumferential outer surface of the
          rotor, said rotor being such as to cause reciprocation of the
          tubular elements over the piston elements, upon rotation of
          the rotor such that the volume of the spaces defined by the
          interiors of the tubular elements and the piston elements
          varies with the rotation of the rotor; each space having
          ignition means and fuel inlet and exhaust outlet
          means~provided therewith.<br>
          <br>
          Unless otherwise specified the term "rotor" should be taken to
          include an eccentrically mounted rotor having either rotary,
          or orbital movement or an oval rotor rotating about a cnetral
          axis, or the like.<br>
          <br>
          The movement of the rotor within the casing may be one in
          which the rotor rotates about a central or eccentric axis or
          one in which the rotor orbits an eccentric axis.<br>
          <br>
          In a preferred form the U shaped chambers are attached to the
          rotor by means of bearings, preferably the bearings are fitted
          to the end of the chamber and are mounted in a channel or
          groove formed in the rotor.<br>
          <br>
          The invention will be more fully understood in the light of
          the following description of two specific embodiments of the
          invention. The following description is made with reference to
          the accompanying drawings.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Figure 1 is a sectional view of an engine according to the

          <br>
          <img alt="" src="au46b.jpg" height="638" width="548"><br>
          <br>
          The embodiment of figure 1 comprises a cylindrical casing 10
          having a series of annular slots 12 in its inner peripheral
          surface. There is mounted in each slot 12 for radial sliding
          motion therein a cylindrical chamber 14 closed at its
          innermost end. The portions 16 formed by the slots 12 acting
          as stationary pistons within the chamber and being provided
          with sealing means between the walls of the chamber 14 and the
          portion 16 in the form of sealing rings 18.<br>
          <br>
          The portion 16 may be formed integrally in the casing or may
          be part of a "head" structure 21 as shown which is removable
          from the casing. In either case the portion 16 at its
          innermost end carries inlet and exhaust valves and a sparking
          plug.<br>
          <br>
          Rotor 23 is substantially oval in shape and is mounted for
          rotation on central drive shaft 25. Each chamber 14 is
          provided with an extension piece 27 having a bearing member 29
          which is engaged by a milled annular slot 30 in one end of the
          rotor. The extension 2'7 is further provided with a gear wheel
          32 which engages ring gear 34 to assist in guiding the
          movement of the rotor in relation to the chamber and absorb
          some of the load between the two components. The chambers are
          preferably off set from the radial orientation as shown in
          order to cause the transfer of motion to be more efficient.<br>
          <br>
          Operation of the valves is via pull rods of the type shown as
          36, the pull rods for the inlet and exhaust valves are
          operated by two suitably shaped cams mounted on the drive
          shaft.<br>
          <br>
          To illustrate the operation of the engine chamber A shall be
          taken as being in the state of ignition and the rotor shall be
          rotating in a clockwise direction. As a result of ignition an
          inwardly applied force is applied to the chamber which is
          transmitted through the gear 32.<br>
          <br>
          Chamber F is undergoing the power stroke while chamber E is
          undergoing the exhaust stroke, the end of which stroke is
          represented by D. Chamber C has completed the intake stroke
          while chamber B is undergoing the compression stroke prior to
          ignition. According to this embodiment for each revolution of
          the drive shaft each chamber fires once.<br>
          <br>
          The embodiment of figure 2 comprises a casing 110 having
          annular slots 112 equally spaced on its inner surface and
          having chambers 114 mounted in the slots for radial sliding
          motion therein. As before the stationary piston 116 may be
          formed integrally in the casing or formed as shown, integrally
          in the head 121. A rotor 123 is counted on shaft 125 such that
          it executes an orbital notion, within the casing. The rotor is
          polygonal in shape and is provided with milled slots 130 in
          one end in wrich bearing members 129 of each chamber are
          engaged.<br>
          <br>
          The bearing members being mounted upon extension pieces 127 of
          each chamber.<br>
          <br>
          As in the previous embodiment inlet and exhaust valves are
          provided at the inner end of pistons 116 and are operated by
          pushrods in rubbing contact with cams driven from the drive
          shaft 125.<br>
          <br>
          In operation each chamber requires two cycles of the a rotor
          for each ignition. For illustration chamber shall be taken as
          undergoing ignition and the movement of the rotor is
          clockwise. After ignition an inwardly directed force by the
          chamber is transmitted to the rotor 123 over the contact
          surface. One complete cycle of the rotor involves the power
          and exhaust stroke while a further complete cycle involves the
          intake and compression strokes.<br>
          <br>
          A two cycle system can also be used in both embodiments.<br>
          <br>
          While the invention has been described with reference to
          cylindrical chambers sliding in annular slots it need not be
          so limited. Each chamber may take the form of an elongated
          channel member mounted in adjacent longitudinal slots with
          suitable sealing being provided between the ends of the
          channels and end plates or the ends of the channels may be
          closed off. Similarly the chambers may have any suitable
          shaped cross-sectional configuration.<br>
          <br>
