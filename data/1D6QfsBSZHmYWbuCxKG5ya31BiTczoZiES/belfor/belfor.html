            aging</b></big><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      A local dentist says he has created an orthodontic appliance that
      can straighten an adult's teeth and reverse the effects of aging
      by remodeling an individual's jaw bones. <br>
      <br>
      Catskill dentist Theodore Belfor said the benefits of his
      Homeoblock Appliance include broader smiles, fuller lips, more
      prominent cheekbones and a brighter, more youthful appearance
      around an individual's eyes. <br>
      <br>
      It also helps straighten teeth and can help eliminate snoring and
      sleep apnea, he said. <br>
      <br>
      "There are no negative side-effects," Belfor said of the
      appliance. appliance stimulates the development of a person's jaws
      where that development was incomplete causing the teeth to become
      crowded in the mouth. The appliance is worn at night and works
      with the body so the changes occur naturally, developing the bones
      of the face, he said. <br>
      <br>
      Belfor said the changes that occur are based on each person's
      genetic potential. Often, facial development does not reach its
      full potential as an individual grows because of the food a person
      eats, lack of breast-feeding as an infant or polluted air, among
      other causes, he said.<br>
      <br>
      Belfor said the Homeoblock helps reverse the sign of aging because
      as the appliance develops the bones of the face it increases the
      volume and support of the soft tissue, which reduces lines and
      wrinkles on the face. <br>
      <br>
      The Homeoblock, according to information provided by Belfor, does
      not work like a typical orthodontic appliance wherein mechanical
      pressure forces the teeth and bones of the dental arches apart.<br>
      <br>
      The acrylic of the Homeoblock Appliance does not actually touch
      the soft tissue in a person's mouth. Instead, the device creates a
      bellows-like action on an individual's dental arches, causing them
      to widen. Each week the patient turns an expansion screw on the
      appliance to keep up with the widening of the bones of the dental
      arches. As the dental arches expand, the teeth have more room in
      the mouth and can straighten out. <br>

            FACIAL FORM IN ADULTS</b><br>
          <b>US7314372</b></big><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      A method and apparatus are provided for changing the form of the
      jaw and facial bones of an adult patient that did not develop
      fully during childhood. The method utilizes a device having a
      plate body with an expansion screw that fits within the mouth of
      the patient; flap springs that project from the plate body, and an
      overlay extending from the plate body. The device is place within
      the mouth of the patient so that the overlay is in a position
      between at least two opposing teeth. In this position, opposing
      teeth contact the overlay during function (e.g. swallowing). This
      intermittent, unilateral application of force to the facial bones
      causes these bones to further develop, positioning out of place
      teeth into more proper positions, and inducing a more symmetrical
      and enhanced appearance of the face, as well as increasing the
      airway space behind the jaws.; Conconmitantly, the flap springs
      gently press against selected teeth that are out of alignment in
      order to guide those teeth into place. Simultaneously, the
      expansion device maintains these forces on the teeth, while
      assisting the jawbones to expand to accept the teeth in their
      proper position. The expansion device can be adjusted by small
      motors under the control of microprocessor located on the body
      plate based on readings from the sensors on the flap springs. The
      expansion device can be adjusted by remote signaling, using a
      global position satellite technology and global position
      coordinates.<br>

      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>1. Field of the Invention</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The present invention relates to a non-surgical method to enhance
      facial form and enhance facial symmetry by using an orthodontic
      dental device or appliance in adults. More specifically, the
      present invention relates to an orthodontic device that stimulates
      the muscles of the face and jaws, which in turn stimulate the bone
      causing a remodeling or reshaping that improves facial symmetry
      and causes jaw development where jaw development did not occur
      during childhood.<br>
      <br>
      <b>2. Discussion of the Related Art</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Devices have been used for decades to straighten patients' teeth.
      Patients' teeth may not erupt optimally for a number of reasons,
      specifically if the jawbone did not fully develop during
      childhood. Thus, in an underdeveloped jaw there is not sufficient
      room to accommodate the patient's full set of teeth. Because there
      is not enough room in the jawbone for all of a patient's teeth,
      some of these devices first require extraction of one or more
      teeth to provide room in the patient's jaws for the remaining
      teeth, so that they may be rotated or otherwise moved into a
      straighter position.<br>
      <br>
      One conventional device that is used to straighten the alignment
      of teeth is braces. Braces are used to move teeth, which causes
      the bone to change locally around the roots of the teeth. Braces
      do not, however, stimulate the muscles of the face and/or jaws,
      and, therefore, do not cause any change of the facial or jawbones,
      except for the local change of the jawbone around the roots of the
      teeth moved by the braces.<br>
      <br>
      Another device used to straighten the alignment of teeth is a
      split palate orthodontic appliance such as that disclosed in U.S.
      Pat. No. 4,026,023 of Fisher. Split palate appliances include a
      split acrylic body whose two body halves are connected with an
      expansion screw. The acrylic body rests against the palate of the
      mouth when the device is placed in the upper jaw, or against the
      lingual surfaces of the mandible when the device is placed in the
      lower jaw. Because prior split palate devices contact the palate,
      they prevent the palate from descending as the palate is widened.
      T-shaped flap springs, which are also known as Fisher flap
      springs, are embedded in the plate body. The free edge of each
      spring makes contact with a selected tooth or teeth to apply a
      predetermined amount of pressure against that tooth. This pressure
      slowly causes selective orthodontic movement of the teeth. In
      particular, the pressure applied by the springs to the teeth
      slowly decreases due to changes in the palate or mandible due to
      the pressure. Thus, periodically (once or twice a week) the
      expansion screw is actuated to further spread apart the two body
      halves, thereby applying (or more accurately reapplying) more
      pressure against the respective teeth. As the jaw remodels,
      however, the widening is usually limited inter alia by sutural
      homeostasis, a regulatory mechanism that is under genetic control,
      and modulated in response to function.<br>
      <br>
      Remodeling of bone through force can occur throughout a person's
      life. It is believed that the bones of some individuals do not
      fully develop during childhood because of a lack of sufficient
      stimulation. <br>
      Primitive man had better-developed jaws, straighter teeth and a
      wider smile than his modern day descendants, because the food was
      very tough and a baby would eat the same food as the parents.
      Modern day babies are reared on soft foods so their jaws do not
      develop as well. On top of that, changes in feeding behavior
      and/or environmental pollution narrow the nasal passages of many
      post-industrial infants. As a result they breathe through their
      mouth, causing their palate to develop inward instead of outward,
      and leaving less room for their upper teeth. Not only does this
      result in crowded and crooked teeth, jaw development (or lack of
      it) affects the morphology of the face.<br>
      <br>
      There is a direct relationship between facial development and
      beauty. In every culture of the world, a symmetrical face with
      high cheekbones, a wide smile and a strong jaw is considered
      beautiful. Even an infant will respond to a wide beautiful smile
      with even teeth. Adults also respond to a well-developed face and
      body as being beautiful.<br>
      <br>
      In the article by Moss, "The role of mechanotransduction,"
      American Journal of Orthodontics Dentofacial Orthopedics, 112:8-11
      (1997) there is a discussion of the "functional matrix
      hypothesis." It asserts that a seamless communication takes place
      when mechanical forces overload the periosteum (tissues around the
      bone and teeth). In effect there is a combination of
      mechanical/biochemical communication that takes place all the way
      down to the individual gene-containing nucleus of the osteocytic
      cells, i.e., the cells that create bone and direct changes in
      bone. This communication directly affects the DNA of the genome
      within the nucleus and creates an interconnected physical chain of
      molecular levers that affect the periosteal functional matrix
      activity, which regulates the genomic activity of its strained
      skeletal unit bone cells, including their phenotypic expression.
      Thus, the theory is that the strain placed on the bone not only
      forces the bone to change, but it triggers the genetic encoding of
      the bone to cause it to continue its earlier arrested development
      toward a symmetrical facial appearance.<br>
      <br>
      None of the prior art devices directly stimulates the muscles of
      the face and jaws, which in turn stimulate the bone causing a
      remodeling or reshaping of the facial and jawbones to improve
      facial symmetry.<br>
      <br>
      None of the prior art devices causes the jawbones to develop where
      jaw development did not occur during childhood.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The present invention is directed to a method for changing the
      form of the jaw and facial bones of a patient that did not develop
      fully during childhood by intermittently applying force to the
      bones through a device that translates the functional actions of
      the patient, such as swallowing, into the necessary force, allied
      with spatial changes associated with the overlay of the
      appliance/device.<br>
      <br>
      In accordance with a presently preferred exemplary embodiment of
      the present invention, the method utilizes a device or appliance
      having a plate body that fits within the mouth of the patient. The
      plate may be in two halves connected by an expansion screw. Flap
      springs project from the plate body and an overlay extends from
      the plate body. Clasps with archways are also connected to the
      plate.<br>
      <br>
      In practicing the method, the appliance is placed within the mouth
      of the patient, e.g., at night. It can be shaped to fit the lower
      jaw (mandible) or upper jaw (maxilla). In either case, the archway
      of each clasp is selectively placed about a tooth to hold the
      appliance in place. In this position the overlay extends over a
      tooth and prevents the jaws from fully closing. Initially, the
      overlay is placed on the patient's underdeveloped side. The flap
      springs press against selected teeth that are out of alignment in
      order to urge those teeth back into place. The unilateral vectors
      of force on the tooth's periodontium cause the jawbone to expand
      to accept the teeth in their proper position. Also, the device is
      arranged such that the patient's facial muscles are caused to
      intermittently pull on the facial bones when the opposing teeth
      contact the overlay during swallowing. This intermittent
      application of force to the facial bones causes these bones to
      further develop toward a symmetrical appearance of the face, and
      positions out of place teeth into proper positions. It is believed
      that the development of the bones into a symmetrical shape is due
      to the functional matrix effect.<br>
      <br>
      The plate body halves of the device can be adjusted toward or away
      from each other by a small micro-motor connected to, or embodying
      the expansion screw. Further, the position of the flap springs,
      and thus the force they apply to the teeth, can also be adjusted
      by the same motor due to the movement of the body halves, or by
      one or additional micro-motors attached to the flap springs.
      Sensors may be applied to the flap springs so that the amount of
      force applied by these springs, either because of their motor or
      the separation of the body plate halves, can be determined.
      Further, a microprocessor can be located on the body plate and
      used to interpret the sensor readings. Further, the microprocessor
      can adjust the expansion screw motor and/or the flap spring motors
      based on the sensor readings, e.g., to keep the pressure even.
      Further, the dental health care professional can design a force
      pattern to be applied by the device to achieve the desired
      results. This pattern can be stored as predetermined parameters in
      a memory associated with the microprocessor, and used by the
      microprocessor with the sensor readings to adjust the motor or
      motors.<br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESENTLY PREFERRED EXEMPLARY
        EMBODIMENTS</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Referring to FIGS. 1-3, there is shown an orthodontic device or
      appliance 10 of the split palate type in accordance with the
      present invention. Device 10 includes a plate body 12, preferably
      of plastic material, such as acrylic. The plate body is preferably
      in two halves 12A, 12B, but it can be in one piece or in several
      pieces of unequal size. Plate body 12 has an overlay 14 extending
      from it to a position that would cover the top of a tooth. While
      it is shown with one such overlay 14 on the left side in FIG. 1,
      it should be understood that the overlay may be on the right side
      and/or the left side. The location of the overlay is based on a
      clinical determination by the dental health care provider as to
      which facial muscles should be stressed more to achieve the
      desired result in an optimal way or how much stress should be
      applied. Typically more stress is applied to the muscles on the
      side where the overlay is located. As a result the overlay should
      be on the side where the facial and jawbones did not fully develop
      during childhood. Additionally, multiple overlays including more
      than one on each side of the device may be used.<br>
      <br>
      A first clasp 16 and a second clasp 18 are connected to the plate,
      preferably by being embedded in the plastic material of plate body
      12. Each clasp 16, 18 includes an archway 20, 22 for selectively
      permitting device 10 to be fitted about a tooth, preferably one of
      the posterior teeth, to hold the device or appliance in place.
      When fitted or connected, overlay 14 may be positioned to extend
      over one of the archways (archway 20 is shown in the FIG. 1, but
      overlay 14 could additionally or alternatively extend over archway
      22) so as to be in contact with the tooth. Overlay 14 is
      preferably placed on top of the tooth adjacent to the archway 20
      or 22 of the respective clasp 18, 20, thereby preventing the jaw
      from fully closing.<br>
      <br>
      The halves 12A, 12B of plate body 12 may be connected by an
      expansion jack screw 24. While the screw 24 may be manually
      adjustable to control the separation of the plate halves, a small
      electrical micro-motor 25 may incorporate the screw 24 and be used
      to adjust the separation.<br>
      <br>
      A Hawley frame 26, in the form of an arch wire, is also connected
      to the plate body 12, preferably by being embedded in the plastic
      material of the plate body 12. Hawley frame 26 wraps around the
      front of the teeth and additionally acts to kept the device 10 in
      place.<br>
      <br>
      A plurality of flap springs 28, which are known in the art as
      Fisher flap springs, are connected to the plate body, preferably
      by being embedded in the plastic material of the plate body 12.
      Each flap spring is T-shaped, I-shaped or L-shaped including a tag
      portion 30 and a tooth supporting portion 32. Some of the tooth
      supporting portions 32 extend for a distance equal to at least the
      width of two teeth (see FIGS. 2 and 3). As is common, the tooth
      support portion 32 rests against the inside of the teeth and
      applies pressure at that location. Typically, the amount of
      pressure can be adjusted by manual bending of the tag portions 30.<br>
      <br>
      As an alternative, small electrical motors 35 can be located
      between the body plate 12 and one or more of the flap springs 28
      to adjust the pressure that the flap springs apply to the teeth
      without having to manually bend the springs. In addition, sensors
      37 can be located at the ends of the flap springs where they meet
      the teeth in order to measure the pressure applied to each tooth
      or group of teeth by the flap spring. The sensor 37 can be located
      in other positions, but in such a case it would not provide a
      direct measurement of the pressure and some calculation would be
      necessary to arrive at the actual pressure.<br>
      <br>
      During use of the device, as the jaw expands and other bones
      develop, it will be necessary to adjust the separation of the body
      plates 12A, 12B, as well as the force of the flap springs, in
      order to continue the development of the bones. This can be
      accomplished during periodic visits, e.g., once a week, to the
      dental health care provider for adjustments. Such adjustments can
      be manual or, where the motors 25, 35 are present, they can be
      made by applying an electric current to the motors. In part, these
      adjustments by the dental health care provider can be assisted by
      the provider reading the output of sensors 37.<br>
      <br>
      A microprocessor 40 can be provided on or embedded within the body
      plate 12. In order to power the microprocessor, a battery 42 would
      also be provided. The microprocessor may be supplied via
      conducting wires with information from the sensors 37 and its
      output can drive the micro-motors 25, 35, via other conducting
      wires at least partially embedded in the plastic body 12, in order
      to automatically keep the pressure on the teeth at a preset level.
      In this way patient errors such as missed, over-zealous or
      reversed screw-turns are eliminated, and the visits to the dental
      health care provider are reduced to an optimized level. Further,
      the dental heath care provider can create a force profile that
      will lead to a good outcome for the patient. For example, the
      force vectors need to be long-acting, low-level and consistent so
      as not to over do the application of force and produce an inferior
      result. This profile may be in the form of data or digital codes
      stored in a memory that is part of the microprocessor. Thus the
      microprocessor would control the motors based on the profile data
      and the readings from the sensors.<br>
      <br>
      By definition, the plate body 12 does not include the clasps 16,
      18, the Hawley frame 26 and the flap springs 28. The body 12 of
      device 10, except for the overlay 14, is spaced from the patient's
      tissue, including the palate and mandibular lingual areas.
      Therefore, the only portion of the plate body 12 that touches the
      patient's tissue is the overlay 14, which contacts the biting
      (occlusal) surface of at least one of the patient's teeth in the
      space where that tooth would normally contact an opposing tooth
      from the opposite set of teeth, i.e., upper or lower jaw. Overlay
      14 is sufficiently thick to prevent the jaws from fully closing.
      The thickness of the overlay, where it contacts the tooth
      preferably ranges from approximately 0.5 mm to approximately 15
      mm. More preferably, the overlay has a thickness ranging from
      approximately 1.0 mm to approximately 6.0 mm. Most preferably, the
      thickness of the overlay ranges from approximately 2.0 mm to
      approximately 4.0 mm, with about 2.0 mm being preferred. The plate
      body 12 itself has a thickness that varies and ranges from about 2
      mm to about 6 mm.<br>
      <br>
      To change the form of the jaw and facial bones with device 10, the
      device is placed within the mouth of a patient so that overlay 14
      contacts at least one tooth and the remainder of the plate body 12
      is spaced from the patient's tissue, including the palate. Overlay
      14 prevents the patient's jaws from fully closing. It is believed
      that this contact of the teeth with the overlay causes
      intermittent force to be applied to the body plate 12 and through
      it to the flap springs 28 to the teeth. It further causes the
      patient's jaw and facial muscles to stimulate the facial and
      alveolar bones during function, essentially each time the patient
      swallows, which is estimated to be about 2,000 to 3,000 times per
      day. This frequent pulling on the facial and alveolar bones is
      believed to cause development of the facial and jaw bones where
      jaw development did not fully occur during childhood. This bone
      development may include a descent of the palate (i.e., remodeling
      of the vault of the palate downwardly toward the lower jaw), if
      necessary.<br>

      Assuming FIG. 2 shows the device of the present invention when
      initially used with a patient at the beginning of treatment, FIG.
      4 is the same view of the device 10 after partial treatment. It
      should be noted that the teeth have been pressed outwardly in FIG.
      4 compared to that in FIG. 2. In effect the jawbone has been
      expanded to accommodate the new position of the teeth.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 5 is a view of the teeth of a patient at the beginning of
      treatment showing the placement of the device and a diagram of the
      alignment of the patient's teeth. Notice that tooth X is out of
      alignment and there is not enough room between adjacent teeth for
      it to be properly aligned. FIG. 6 is similar to FIG. 5, but at a
      time after partial treatment of the patient. Notice that tooth X
      is now better aligned because more room has been provided between
      the adjacent teeth because of the effect of the device 10.<br>
      <br>
      Marked on the illustration of FIG. 5 is a diagram of the alignment
      of the teeth. Using specific landmarks, reference lines
      (finite-elements) are drawn from location "0" on body plate half
      12A and from location 15 on body plate half 12B to the teeth. The
      finite-elements are drawn to locations (landmarks) on the teeth,
      which are toward their front surfaces at about the mid points with
      regard to locations 1, 2, and 3 on body plate half 12A, as well as
      to locations 12, 13 and 14 on body plate half 12B. These represent
      teeth that are already in alignment. As regards the teeth to be
      aligned, similar finite-elements are drawn to the edges of each
      tooth, e.g., to locations 4, 5 for one tooth and 6, 7 for the
      other tooth from body plate 12A. Similarly, lines are drawn to
      locations 8, 9 and 10, 11 for the teeth contacted by the flap
      springs from plate body half 12B. Thus, specific landmarks are
      used to identify regions of the teeth and the device. By
      subjecting these specific landmarks to finite-element analysis,
      localization and quantification of changes in shape, size and
      direction of the spatial arrangements of the teeth and the device
      are computed, using a method developed by Singh et alia
      (Morphometry of the cranial base in subjects with Class III
      malocclusion. Journal of Dental Research, 76(2): 694-703, 1997).<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 7 shows the same patient about six (6) months later after
      wearing the device, essentially for at least four waking hours per
      day and while sleeping approximately eight hours per night. Notice
      that tooth X is nearly aligned. Finally, in FIG. 8 the arrangement
      of the teeth is shown at the end of treatment with tooth X
      properly aligned with the rest of the teeth. Throughout the
      process shown in FIGS. 6-8, the patient's jawbone has expanded in
      size, probably due to bone remodeling in the palatal region, and
      the teeth have been moved into new and properly aligned positions.<br>
      <br>
      FIGS. 9-13 are diagrams of the teeth as marked in FIGS. 5-8
      showing the progression of alignment of the teeth due to the
      device. These diagrams can be plotted in a graphics program such
      as Morpho Studio, e.g., version 2.0 or higher. This set of
      diagrams particularly shows the movement of tooth X. As this
      response is typical of use of the invention, the diagrams of FIGS.
      9-13 can be used to create a force profile, which would indicate
      the preferable force to be applied along each segment of the
      diagram at particular points in time in order to produce an
      acceptable result in the shortest period of time. When a
      microprocessor controlled device is used, this profile can be
      incorporated into the program of the microprocessor to apply force
      over time to the teeth in this manner.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 14 is an illustration of a patient's face at the beginning of
      treatment showing a diagram of the alignment of the eyes. Line 50
      shows the alignment of the patient's eye on the left side of the
      illustration and line 52 shows the alignment of the patient's eye
      on the right side. The angle between the eyes is labeled 54. As
      can be seen, this angle 54 is noticeably less than 180 degrees,
      which would indicate perfect symmetry. FIG. 16 is a computer
      generated diagram of the lines 50, 52, which shows their
      relationship in more detail because the facial features are not
      present.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 15 is an illustration of the face of the same patient shown
      in FIG. 14 after full treatment with the device according to the
      invention. As can be seen, the angle 54 is now almost 180 degrees,
      which indicates the alignment of the eyes and the symmetrical
      nature of the face. FIG. 17, which is a computer generated diagram
      of lines 50, 52 shows the alignment in more detail.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 18 is a diagram showing the change in facial bone development
      from that of the patient in FIG. 14 to that in FIG. 15, using
      finite-element analysis. In the diagram, the point 0 is at the
      outside corner of the eye of the patient on the left side of the
      illustration in FIGS. 14 and 15, while point 3 is at the outside
      corner of the eye on the right side of the illustration. Point 4
      is at the tip of the patient's nose in FIGS. 14 and 15. The shaded
      areas of the diagram show the size increase and the cross hatched
      areas indicate the size decrease. The application of force would
      be expected to create a decrease in the bone mass, but not an
      increase. Thus, there is a remodeling of the patient's face that
      is not completely explainable by mere application of force. This
      diagram can be produced by Morpho Studio software, version 2.0 or
      higher.<br>
      <br>
      In each of FIGS. 5-18, it can be seen that the use of device 10
      caused a remodeling or reshaping of the face and jawbones thereby
      creating better facial symmetry. This remodeling of the bones
      resulted in at least one of higher cheekbones, stronger jaw
      appearance and a wider smile, facial features that society usually
      equates with a pretty or handsome face.<br>
      <br>
      This alignment was brought about by the application of
      intermittent force to the tissues of the face. During function,
      e.g., as the patient swallows while wearing the device, either
      while awake or asleep, the teeth come into contact with the
      overlay 14, which applies force to the face muscles and through
      the device to the bones of the jaw. This repetitive force causes
      deformation of the bones of the jaw and face. While not wishing to
      be held to any theory of operation, it is believed that the
      symmetrical nature of the result of the reformation of the jaw and
      facial bones is not due entirely to the application of force to
      specific areas of bone, but to the genetic code of the patient as
      predicted by the functional matrix hypothesis of Moss.<br>
      <br>
      FIGS. 19 and 20 illustrate a stylized and a simplified three
      dimensional virtual computer model of the device. In particular,
      FIG. 20 is a finite element model. Its entire surface is covered
      with finite elements (or reference points), each indicated with a
      small "x." However, in the drawing, only some of the finite
      elements are shown for simplicity. Computer modeling as shown in
      FIGS. 19 and 20 can be used to analyze the function of the device
      and to test various configurations. This is particularly true with
      respect to the effects of the overlay and plate, as well as
      automatic control of micro-motors. <br>
      As a result of such modeling, the testing of a new device can be
      reduced, thus reducing the time to market the product. Further, it
      is possible to use the device model in conjunction with models of
      the human face, to predict the response to muscle action and the
      correction of facial distortions with various designs of the
      appliance, according to the functional matrix hypothesis of Moss.<br>
