I've made an entry for RVRE on ZeroSites and I'll gladly update it when you get a human-friendly address.\n\nThanks for making the entry! As for the domain, I'm not sure.  I have one left over from Bwoi (bwoi.bit) but I've got no clue when I'll actually get a RVRE one.  I'm hoping that I'll get round to it within the next few days (need to get namecoin!).  ",
