			"body": "On of my counterargument to Your current blog post is that The West is actually not only America and UK. Most English speakers on planet Earth do not speak English natively. Neither do I, my native language is Estonian. About 30% of Estonian population and literally about 50% of the citizens of Estonian capital, the Tallinn, speak Russian natively. I consider Estonia as part of The West. The mainstream pundits at American mainstream propaganda industry(\"media industry\") do not really reflect even most of the American views. You notice them, because they are the loudest. A respectful American concentrates on its work and life goals, but the paid pundits yell stupid \"tweets\" at the American mainstream cesspool-media.\n\nThat is to say, Yes, You should try to learn the various western, not only U.S. and UK, literature, but YOU ARE WASTING YOUR TIME if You look at the western mainstream media. The best source for information is an RSS reader that reads Your own set of blogs. The second best western news source is the various alternative outlets, like the WikiLeaks, and some non-mainstream propaganda outlets that publish CRAP most of the time, but that have some extremely well done news feeds. For example, the best newsfeed on planet earth for covering the Egyptian revolution was the \nhttps://www.democracynow.org/\nbut most of the time, specially lately, it publishes CRAP.\nThe Edward Snowden story was the main material that allowed the creation of the \nhttps://theintercept.com/\nbut now that they have run out of material, they just try to get by and publish shoddier stuff.  I think that the best article that TheIntercept has ever done is \nhttps://theintercept.com/a-conversation-about-privacy/\n\nA competitor to the Amy Goodman is Laura Flanders, who is essentially a communist, but a communist with a twist:\nhttp://www.lauraflanders.com/\nOne of her best videos:\nhttp://www.lauraflanders.com/?video=d1-ShiRtzRk\n\nHere's some western media that is much better than the mainstream crap:\nhttps://www.icij.org/\nhttps://rsf.org/en\nhttps://www.hrw.org/\nhttps://www.eff.org/\n\nYour main problem is probably that due to limited command of English You have difficulties surfing and navigating the western info-sphere, just like I have difficulties finding information from the various Russian sites. An example of a very interesting find from Russian materials:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWX-F-EnuAc\n\n",
