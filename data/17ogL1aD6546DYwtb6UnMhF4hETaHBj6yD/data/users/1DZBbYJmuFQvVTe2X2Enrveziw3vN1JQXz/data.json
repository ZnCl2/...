			"body": "As long as Russians can buy a VPN-connection to the West, they can keep on using various messengers. The moment the whole Russian outer-connection to the West is cut off, the card payments at Russian hotels will also stop working, unless a hotel has its own satellite phone connection that allows TCP/IP data transfer. There's also the option to use mesh networks combined with optical networks near border areas. A simpler option is to take a trip to Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Finland, create a local cell phone operator account and then get the Internet connection through some Baltic or Finnish or Polish mobile internet provider. That connection can be then relayed on inside Russia using mesh networks. At least it will work until cellphone communication is not jammed near the Russian borders and that can not be done without causing yet another international incident, because the jammers will jam cellphone communications outside of the Russian Federation borders.",
