There are, of course, claims to those who support Merkel in terms of anti-Russian sanctions, but this is another story :) With the Second World War, this has nothing to do. The text above refers to a sensational event when a Russian schoolboy speaking in Germany called ordinary German soldiers innocent victims of the war.\n> Russians and Germans, in general, are two different, but very close in spirit people. It is a great tragedy that we fought so much with each other instead of building a common world.\n\nyeah i do agree.. also you seem to know wayyy fucking more about politics and things than i ever have :) it's nice to learn something new while i'm just trying to get by :)",
