If you look at some websites about this subject it says mixing alcohols doesnt change anything.\n\nWe probably all know this, and it is true: Vodka gin rum Tequila brandy Rye mixed with Crazy liqueurs and then mixed with juices and acids and sugars, totally makes for a frenetic drunk and an earlier black out when too much is consumed.\n\nEach body comes from a different gene pool that has been doing its thing for 1000's of years, so some spirits work better with some bodies than others. (Or you're genes are used to being pickled and you can mix anything you like)\n\nTry this: drink one type of spirit, (one brand if you can) all night one night and feel out how your body likes it, or what kind of buzz it's giving you. I'll tell you right now a tequila buzz is a lot different than a whiskey, and wine is totally different than beer.\n\nNot all gins are created equal, and rum is... Well, you'll see."
