<span class="c9">Red</span> <span class="c9">-</span> <span class="c10"> <i>pseudonym for an individual</i>;</p>
<p>Red is a part-time contributor to a variety of censorship resistant networks, chiefly I2P. Red is also the author of <i>Red Liberty</i>, a clearnet libertarian socialist blog mirrored on Tor, I2P, Freenet, and ZeroNet. Red is also the maintainer of the <i>unofficial</i> Marxists Internet Archive mirror on I2P. A long time user of Freenet, Tor, and I2P, red has inserted and hosted a number of hidden services that he/she believes make these censorship resistant networks a better place.</span>
<p class="c15">Privacy is one of the fundamental prerequisites to civil liberty in the digital age, and one cannot possibly be free if they are being proactively <a href="https://edwardsnowden.com/">observed</a> and recorded by those in power at all times, for freedom (referring of course to negative freedom, or civil liberty) is always the freedom of dissent. Privacy is a necessary social cornerstone for the preservation of the existence of an open society.</p>
<p class="c15">I2P has the potential to be what the internet was before the NSA spied on everyone and the US government made it legal for corporate ISP's to sell your internet
 history to the highest bidder. At the very least it can be a safe haven for the vanguard of the digital rights movement, its hackers and activists, the most technically knowledgable advocates of digital liberty and the restoration of the fourth amendment in practice.</p>
<p class="c15">Anonymity in regards to the internet is a means to unhindered intellectual exploration. The violation of man's privacy in matters of intellectual exploration means a violation of man's inalienable rights. Man has a right to uncensored, unobserved intellectual exploration if he is to be free. This must be accepted with all its concequences and social ramifications for it is far better to place trust in the individual than in centralized, authoritative, secretive corporations and nation states. Anonymity is a means for man to explore the world around him but ultimately it is a means for him to explore <i>himself</i>. Only in privacy can man truly think for himself and question authority. The internet means the entirety of human knowledge is a click away, much of which does exist on the so-called "darkweb". The individual has access to all manner of knowledge both good and evil. He must find himself, confront himself, know himself. Fearless explorer, let your own conscience be your guide and above all to thine own self be true.</p>
