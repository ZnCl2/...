<p class ="c15">Generally it boils down to a few things:</p>
<small>
<p class ="c15">-The internet should be decentralized and privacy respecting by default. Transparency for the powerful, privacy for everyone else.</p>
<p class ="c15">-The internet and society as a whole should not rely on undemocratic corporations or state power (both are usually bad).</p>
<p class ="c15">-Democracy should be face-to-face, real <i>politics</i> as opposed to statecraft (DuckDuckGo Murray Bookchin)</p>
<p class ="c15">-Democratize the enterprise! Bring all major corporations under democratic control, industrial democracy (socialism) as a necessary prerequisite to grassroots political democracy</p>
<p class ="c15">-Unlimited individual liberty, freedom is always the freedom of the dissenters. Democracy and open society should be saved.</p>
<p class ="c15">-Positive Liberty is necessary, we must grow the tree of Liberty (it was as absurd to speak of a right to healthcare in 1776 as it was to speak
 of freedom of the press in pre-literate society).</p>
<p class ="c15">-In a world that produces enough food to feed 10 billion people a year, the existence of world hunger is a crime against humanity.</p>
<p class ="c15">-When there are 5 empty homes for every homeless person in the wealthiest country in the world, the existence of homelessness is a crime
against humanity.</p>
<p class ="c15">-The Book of Acts is the first real "Communist Manifesto". God is love.</p>
<p class ="c15">-There is no such thing as green capitalism. Socialism or barbarism.</p>
<p class ="c15">-All drugs should be legal and regulated. Consenting adults want what they want and this is a personal matter. But at the same time healthy adults should look into taking psychedelics at least once in their lives. Turn on, Tune in, Drop out.</p>
<p class ="c15">-Against dogmatism and political religions. Don't take yourself too seriously, always admit everything you "know" could be wrong. 20th century was a nightmare, we can do better. The methods must embody the aims.</p>
<p class ="c15">-Political correctness is often counter-productive (see Slavoj Zizek).</p>
<p class ="c15">-Don't be mean to people or disrespect them just because they have different political/religious views than you. Follow the golden rule.</p>
<p class ="c15">-Other libertarian socialist stuff. Check out Red Liberty!</p>
</small>
<!-- <p class="c15">Information should be free, its architecture of distribution and exchange radically decentralized. 
The internet belongs to all, it should rely on neither corporate ISP nor government, but on the community itself. 
We should have a face-to-face democracy, political democracy should be decentralized focusing on the community at the 
local and municiple level, not consisting of one oligarch or demogague competing over another on billionaire run TV 
stations where we can "freely" cast a ballot once every 2 to 4 years. Lesser evilism is a race to the bottom and both 
parties belong to wall street. Black Lives Matter, and we say this precisely because all lives matter-- the latter slogan 
being a misinformed response to the former. The top 500 corporations should be socialized; democratically run to meet human
 needs. We should have a democratic press, one free from the fetters of state control and corporate ownership at the same 
time. Positive liberty is real and necessary, it was as absurd to speak of a right to healthcare in 1774 as it was to speak
 of freedom of the press in pre-literate society. 
In a world that produces enough food to feed 10 billion people a year, the existence of world hunger is a crime against humanity.
When there are 5 empty homes for every homeless person in the wealthiest country in the world, the existence of homelessness is a crime
against humanity. 

Let us cast off the fetters of a social, economic, political, ethical, and ideological system rooted in the material
 scarcity of the past and embrace one based on the world of material abundance we currently find ourselves in today. 
Only radical change can seriously address the impending ecological catastrophe that the ruling order blames on the individual, 
that the ruling order regards with extreme nihilism. There is no such thing as green capitalism. We are the last hope for democracy, 
liberty, and a sustainable ecological future. We have no crystal ball or "master plan". Our conviction stems from our belief
 in democracy itself. Socialism or barbarism, Liberty or death!</p> ehhhhhh pass on this one -->
