	<h3> What is the purpose of the site? </h3> 
	<p> The purpose of this site is to provide a good and reliable lottery service for the cryptocurrency community. </p> 
	
	</br> </br>
	
	<h3> How do I participate in the lottery? </h3>
	<p> You can participate by purchasing a ticket. Each ticket will cost roughly $5 USD. For example, as of December 18, 2017, $5 in bitcoin is 0.000265. We understand that the price fluctuates constantly, so to keep ticket purchases fair, as well as keep them as close as possible to the $5 mark, ticket price will be updated with every jackpot payout. </p> 
	
	</br> </br> 
	
	
    <h3> What determines ticket price? </h3>
    <p> Ticket price is determined by the value of the coin. As explained in the previous question, tickets will cost around $5 USD. This price will be updated with every jackpot. </p> 	

    </br> </br> 
    
    <h3> How is the jackpot calculated? </h3>
    <p> For each ticket purchased 90% of recieved funds go into into the jackpot. The remaining 10% goes towards funding the website. In the future we are hoping to make the 10% cut smaller, and put most of the remaining 10% into smaller prize pots. </p> 
    
    </br> </br> 
    
	<h3> What are my chances of winning? </h3>
	<p> Your chances of winning is based on how many tickets you purchase. If there was a total of 10 tickets purchased, and you purchased two of them, your probability of winning is 20%. To increase your odds you can purchase more tickets. </p> 

    </br> </br> 

    <h3> When is the winner of the jackpot announed? </h3> 
    <p> The winner is announced and payments are sent out on the first of every month. However, if there are fewer than 10 tickets purchased the jackpot will cary over to the next month, and will continue to cary over untill atleast 10 tickets are purchased. </p> 
	
	</br> </br> 
	
	<h3> Why is the site so plain? </h3>
	<p> This site looks plain and boring because we do not want to focus our time into making the site look pretty, but instead improving the experience for the users. Also, because we are not too familiar with CSS. In the future we may try to make the site look better, but for now it is not a priority. </p>
	
	</br> </br>
	
	<h3> Am I eligible to participate? </h3> 
	<p> Anyone is able to participate. As long as it does not interfere with your local law, or U.S. law. If we find out that it was illegal for you to play, we will have to revoke your tickets. You may or may not recieve a refund. </p> 
	
	</br> </br> 
	
	<h3> I accidently sent to much, can I get back the excess money? </h3>
	<p> Yes, we can send back the money you accidently sent to us. However you must be aware of potential tranaction fees. If the amount is insignificant (~1000 satoshi) then there would be no point in sending it back, as transaction fees will take most, if not all of it. Also, if you ment to only purchase one ticket, but sent enough for two, then we might deny your request of a refund and instead give you the extra ticket. </p> 

    </br> </br> 

    <h3> Is there a signup option? </h3> 
    <p> There is currently not a signup option, nor will there ever be a required one. We will only use your address to identify you, because that's all we need. In the future we might implement a signup feature, so it will be easier for users to keep track of their purchased tickets. </p> 	
	
	</br> </br> 
	
	<h3> Why has my ticket purchase not appeared on the website? </h3> 
	<p> We update the site manually at least once a day. There is no scipt that updates it automatically. Do not worry if your purchase does not appear immediatly, you are still in the running for the jackpot </p>
