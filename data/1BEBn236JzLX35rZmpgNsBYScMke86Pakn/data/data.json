Bitter melon has been used in various Asian and African herbal medicine systems for a long time.[6][7][8] In Turkey, it has been used as a folk remedy for a variety of ailments, particularly stomach complaints.[9] In traditional medicine of India different parts of the plant are used as claimed treatments for diabetes (particularly Polypeptide-p, an insulin analogue),and as a stomachic, laxative, antibilious, emetic, anthelmintic agent, for the treatment of cough, respiratory diseases, skin diseases, wounds, ulcer, gout, and rheumatism.[10]\n\nMomordica charantia has a number of purported uses including cancer prevention, treatment of diabetes, fever, HIV and AIDS, and infections.[11] While it has shown some potential clinical activity in laboratory experiments, \"further studies are required to recommend its use\".[11] In 2012, the germplasm and chemical constituents, such as momordicin within several varieties of the gourd were being studied.[12]\n\nFor fever reduction and relief of menstrual problems, there is no scientific research to back these claims.[11] For cancer prevention, HIV and AIDS, and treatment of infections, there is preliminary laboratory research, but no clinical studies in humans showing a benefit.[11] In 2017 the University of Peradeniya researchers revealed that bitter gourd seeds can be potentially used to destroy cancer cells and was successfully administered to patients in Kandy General Hospital[13][better source needed] Cancer Unit.\n\nWith regard to the use of Momordica charantia for diabetes, several animal studies and small-scale human studies have demonstrated a hypoglycemic effect of concentrated bitter melon extracts.[14][15][16] In addition, a 2014 review shows evidence that Momordica charantia, when consumed in raw or juice form, can be efficacious in lowering blood glucose levels.[17] However, multiple reviews have found that Momordica charantia does not significantly decrease fasting blood glucose levels or A1c, indicators of blood glucose control, when taken in capsule or tablet form.[17][18] Momordica charantia may be beneficial in diabetes, however the effects seem to depend on how it is consumed.[17] More studies need to be performed in order to verify this effect.[17] The Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center concludes that bitter melon \"cannot be recommended as a replacement therapy for insulin or hypoglycemic drugs\".[11]\n"

It seems like such a safety hazard as well as an eyesore for our roads.\"\n\nWith the help of Station Sergeant Marcus Boorman, head of traffic operations for ACT Policing, and the ACT Government official in charge of dealing with Canberra's forgotten automobiles, Sean Sloan, we set out to answer every question you might have relating to abandoned cars. \n\nHow many cars are abandoned each year? \n\n\n\n\n\nAn abandoned car on a Canberra median strip with police tape on its mirror. \nVehicles with police tape may still need to be reported to Access Canberra.

Then the waiting game starts again. \n\nDepending on the estimated value of the car, the Government is required to keep it for anywhere from a week to three months before it can be sold for scrap metal or auctioned. \n\n\n\"We're looking at and reviewing our own systems... on how we can do things better,\" Mr Sloan said.\n\n\"We've actually just engaged a different towing contractor that... can actually get out to these vehicles a lot faster.\"\n\nWhat else can be done? \n\n\n\n\n\nACT Policing Sergeant Marcus Boorman. \nStation Sergeant Marcus Boorman says broken down cars can be targeted by opportunists.

(ABC Radio Canberra: Penny Travers) \n\n\n\nMr Riley collects six tonnes of organic waste each week from more than 40 government departments, businesses and schools across Canberra.\n\nThe large worm farms, which house in total eight million worms, are up to 20 metres long and 1.8 metres wide.\n\nFor the home setup he recommended positioning a plastic worm farm on a patio, in a shed or burying it in the ground. \n\n\"With those little plastic worm farms they're a great design but in climates like Canberra, they can get way too cold in winter and way too hot in summer,\" he said. \n\nYou need to select a worm farm setup based on the amount of organic waste your household produces each week.\n\nFor a family producing about one kilogram of scraps each day, Mr Riley recommended a raised garden bed that was 1.5 to two metres square in size.\n\nIt is best to cover it with something like a shade cloth to maintain the moist, dark conditions and keep out pests. \n\nA pile of composting worms\n Photo: Red wrigglers, Indian blue and tiger worms are the three main composting worms. (ABC Radio Canberra: Penny Travers) \n\n\n\nConsider layout and bedding \n\nThe layout of the worm farm is also important.\n\n\n\"Worms like to have a kitchen and a lounge room,\" Mr Riley said.\n\n\"The lounge room really is their bedding material, it's that nice material that they can live in and eat as well, like coconut fibre, newspaper, aged manure and straw and things like that.\n\n\"Then you feed them the food scraps on top and they'll come there and eat out in the kitchen.\n\n\"If you've got a combination of both and lots of bedding material, it gives the worms somewhere to escape to if the conditions aren't quite right.\"\n\nFeeding the worm farm organic waste\n Photo: Large worm farms can handle most organic matter including bags made from cornstarch. (ABC Radio Canberra: Penny Travers) \n\n\n\nOnce you have the moist bedding set up, it is time to introduce some worms. \n\nThe three common composting worms are red wriggler, Indian blue and tiger, which all grow up to 7.5 centimetres. \n\nAvoid overfeeding your worms\n\nToo much food could be a problem.\n\nMr Riley recommended feeding your backyard worms once or twice a week.\n\n\"If you heat your vegetable scraps or put too much in, the air can't get into it and it can start to generate heat and ferment.\n\n\"Spread the food over a large surface area rather than just heaping it in one spot.\"\n\nA healthy worm farm has no odour.\n\n\n\"If you can smell your worm farm, something is wrong, it's fermenting,\" Mr Riley said. \n\n\"You need to investigate what the problem is, get some dry material in and aerate it.\"\n\nHands holding a pile of vermicast with worm eggs\n Photo: A sign of happy worms is worm eggs. Each yellow egg contains between five and 10 worms. (ABC Radio Canberra: Penny Travers) \n\n\n\nHovering vinegar flies is also a sign that food waste is fermenting.\n\nCovering your worm farm or burying the scraps will help stop the flies.\n\nWhat you should and shouldn't feed your worms\n\nFor small backyard worm farms, acidic foods like garlic, onion and citrus, as well as meat and dairy, should be kept out.\n\nLarger backyard worm farms or raised garden bed-style farms are big enough to handle most organic waste.\n\nMr Riley suggested treating the worm farm like your cooking.\n\n\"It's great to have a little bit of lemon zest, but if we ate a whole plateful of lemons it's going to make us a bit sick.\n\n\"It's a bit like that with the worms — if they've got some lemon peel they're going to be able to handle it, but if you completely fill your worm farm it could acidify it and create problems.\"\n\nThe scraps that do not go into your worm farm could be added to a compost bin.\n\nCommercial-sized worm farm\n Photo: Cid Riley collects scraps from thousands of public servants and school students each week. (ABC Radio Canberra: Penny Travers) \n\n\n\nCollecting the vermicast for your garden\n\nWorm farms produce nutrient-rich vermicast which can be collected once or twice per year and added to your garden.\n\n\n\"Worms reduce the volume by about 95 per cent, so a tonne of food waste makes 50 kilograms of castings,\" Mr Riley said. \n\nWhen it comes time to harvest the castings, take the cover off to allow light in and vibrate the surface so the worms move to the bottom.\n\n\"I'm sure they're chatting to each other saying, 'let's meet down the bottom and get in a big ball to steer clear of what's going on up there',\" Mr Riley joked.\n"

			"body": "Pressure Canning – The most stable way to preserve meat is perhaps pressure canning.  The process of pressure canning heats the meat sufficiently to kill all spoilage organisms, including the deadly botulism bacterium. The steps of the process must be followed carefully to assure safety, but they are not difficult.  You will need a pressure canner, jars, lids for the jars, and uninterrupted time to do your canning.  Meat needs to be cut into chunks small enough to fit in the jars.  I prefer to purchase roasts and cut the chunks myself as I like them a bit larger than regular stew meat size.  Because the canning process produces a very tender meat, inexpensive cuts such as flank or chuck roast can be used.  While the meat doesn’t need to be extremely lean, trim most of the fat.  I use the dry pack method for meat.  Meat is packed tightly into pint jars, leaving ½ inch of space at the top.  A teaspoon of salt is added to each jar.  The rims of the jar are wiped with a clean cloth and a hot lid is screwed on tightly.  The jars are then placed in the canner.  Water is added to the canner about halfway up the jars and brought to a boil before the lid is sealed.  Read the instructions that came with your canner as to the best way to operate it and the appropriate time and pressure for your area.  It is also wise to have the pressure gauge on your canner tested each year by your local extension office.  Pressure canned meat lasts for years and can be used for many dishes from stews to enchiladas."

You will need fresh pork, pickling salt, brown sugar, and crocks or jars for storage.\n\nFirst, cut the pork into slabs. Generally, four- to six-inch slabs work best. Mix 1/2 pound of pickling salt with 1/4 cup of brown sugar. This is enough to cover twelve pounds of pork. Liberally cover the pork with this mixture. Next, pack the meat into sterilized crocks or jars. You should make sure it is tightly packed. Cover the meat with cheesecloth.\n\nUsing the temperature chart of your house, determine where to store your crocks. You need to keep the meat in an area that is about 36°F – no higher than 38°F. You also do not want an area that could see freezing temperatures. Leave the meat in this cool storage for at least one month. After that time, you can wrap the meat in plastic or moisture-proof paper and leave it stored all winter. You now have salt-cured pork for any occasion.\n\nMany older people remember having a smokehouse on their land when they were young. Meat would be salted and hung to cure in these cool, dry areas. You could build a storage room for handing meat without too much work. The room should have excellent air circulation and stay cool without freezing.\n\n\n"

			"body": "Man-made disturbances, such as roadside or reclamation projects, can result in serious soil-erosion problems, destroying the soil profile and adversely affecting the surrounding natural habitat. Temporary cover crops are a popular strategy because they reduce the threat of erosion, aid restoration efforts by establishing the nutritional base necessary for re-vegetation and offer a soil-root matrix to anchor naturalizing plants.\n \nBy definition, a temporary cover is vegetation you seed onto a site to provide soil stabilization for 2 to 12 months until you can sow the permanent \"crop.\" You may need to stabilize soil for longer periods, but you must be careful that the temporary cover you use does not out-compete desired permanent vegetation once you plant it.\n   \nPeople often ask me about suitable temporary crops during revitalization of roadside or reclamation projects. The need for such crops may arise if problems delay a permanent reclamation seeding beyond the preferred seeding dates. The temporary cover will hold and contain soil from erosion loss until construction resumes. Using temporary cover crops is environmentally proactive, keeping the site from exposure to the elements for a prolonged period, risking serious soil erosion.\n \nTemporary covers provide numerous benefits: * They serve as barriers protecting the soil surface from wind and water erosion. * Organic matter from the cover crop's active root growth retains moisture, protects the soil structure from compaction and allows water and nutrients to penetrate the soil. * Temporary covers limit pesticide and fertilizer runoff. * They increase beneficial nutrients in the soil (especially if you use them as a green manure crop) and improve microorganism activity within the soil profile. Lastly, temporary covers can reduce weed populations and may improve animal-habitat preservation.\n \nSoil-conservation research has documented the merits of a temporary stand for preventing soil loss. The more quickly you cover the site with temporary vegetation, the less damage will occur to the site's integrity. To select the most appropriate temporary cover, consider site location, time of year, soil characteristics, anticipated precipitation and intended use of the site. A reputable supplier can be of great help in the selection process.\n \nGood seed-to-soil contact is necessary for enhancing seed establishment . A sterile fiber mulch or clean straw protects germinating seed. Also, consider the seed quality of the temporary crop. Grains, grasses and mulch covers not screened for weed content can cause future problems depending on the sensitivity of the site.\n \nCharacteristics of temporary covers vary by species, of course. However, in general, they exhibit several common traits that make them appropriate for this use: rapid germination and seedling establishment, good lateral growth, slow vertical growth and tolerance of droughty and infertile soils. Non-native annual grasses such as annual ryegrass-which might be too aggressive for native landscapes-may be suitable for vegetating disturbed sites during a re-vegetation process.\n \nNumerous species qualify for use as temporary cover crops. According to the 1994 U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Handbook No. 170 (available through the U.S. Government Printing Office), more than 120 improved cultivars of grasses, legumes, herbs and shrubs are available for use in soil stabilization. Annual grasses, cereal grains and legumes are the most common choices for temporary crops, although some perennial grasses also are suitable. Permanent stabilization projects often specify a greater diversity in perennial grasses, forbs and legumes than for temporary cover. In this article, I mostly will discuss grasses for temporary use.\n \nAnnual grasses *Annual ryegrass. Many landscapers consider annual ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum) as the grass of choice for soil stabilization. Recognized also as \"domestic\" or \"Italian\" ryegrass, it is an economical addition to cool-season perennial-turfgrass seed mixes to bulk up the seeding rate. Common in roadside mixes, annual ryegrass is important on sites with a severe grade, where its rapid establishment will firmly and quickly anchor the soil and help preserve the site's integrity. Unfortunately, this same aggressive quality can crowd out the perennial grasses the annual ryegrass was intended to aid, particularly if you've added too much annual-ryegrass seed to the mix. For mixes containing slow-growing fine fescues or wildflowers, add no more than 10 percent annual ryegrass (by weight) to the mix, and then only if absolutely necessary to prevent severe erosion.\n \nIn northern temperate climates, plant annual ryegrass in late spring (to establish a site during the summer months when other grasses may not persist) or later in the growing season to stabilize a site before winter. Typically, annual ryegrass produces seed and completes its life cycle in the same year it is established. However, fall-planted annual ryegrass may act as a winter annual if the winter season is mild or if the plants have protection from extreme cold. Then it will produce seed the following year. In southern climates, too, you can sow annual ryegrass in late summer or early fall to help stabilize a site and prevent erosion.\n \n* Cereal grains. Annual cereal grains such as cereal rye, barley and oats serve as alternatives for temporary soil-stabilization covers. You can sow any of them alone or in a mix of grains, grasses or legumes. Cereal rye (Secale cereale), or winter rye, is one of the best grains to use as a winter-annual cover crop for projects that extend well beyond typical seeding dates. It germinates and establishes at lower soil temperatures than other grains and grasses. Planting cereal rye from late September to early October in northern locations and late October in southern climates will provide some winter cover and early spring growth.\n \nCereal rye also is a good companion crop to seed along with native grasses in landscape and golf-course designs. Because germination and establishment of native grasses is slow during the first growing season, cereal rye added to the native-grass mix helps reduce soil erosion while the natives develop their root systems and become established. Many natives such as Indiangrass and the bluestems are warm-season grasses and their use in temperate climates requires longer establishment times than in warmer climates. The cereal rye also helps stabilize the site during winter months, does not crowd seedlings during their establishment and does not persist once active spring growth begins the following year.\n \n* Barley (Hordeum vulgare) tolerates warm, dry conditions although you can sow it in mild-spring or -fall climates as either a summer or winter cover. Site managers usually use barley as a spring planting in temperate climates, while fall- or winter-cover planting is its more common use in the warmer climates of California or the South.\n \n* Oats (Avena sativa) fit well into many reclamation projects for short-term needs. Oats are best adapted to temperate climates and prefer moderate precipitation. This species tolerates a wide range of soil types, provided soil fertility is adequate. Sow oats as a fall crop in southern regions to enhance soil stabilization.\n \n* Sudangrass. Sudangrass (Sorghum sudanense) was first introduced from Africa to the United States in the early 1900s. Sudangrass is a warm-season annual that prefers warm, moist soils but can adapt to a variety of conditions. Used as a temporary green-manure crop, Sudangrass is a common ingredient of pasture or silage crops and reclamation mixes. It can tolerate some moisture stress, which makes it a desirable component in reclamation mixes. Although active growth slows during times of limited moisture, it easily resumes when moisture again becomes available.\n \n* Millet. Millet is an important crop for the forage and birdseed industries and is also useful in soil-stabilization and reclamation mixes. Foxtail millet (Setaria italica), brown-top millet (Panicum ramosum) and Japanese millet (Echinochloa frumentacea) are important temporary cover crops, particularly in the central and southern portions of the United States. Brown-top millet is popular in southern regions for use in damp reclamation mixes. With growing requirements similar to Sudangrass, reclamation mixes often contain millets in addition to, or as a substitute for, that species. Foxtail millet is an annual warm-season grass that matures in 75 to 90 days and requires warm temperatures and ample moisture for optimal growth. Although it prefers warm weather, it has a shallow root system and is subject to drought injury. It has a rather dense, bristly seed head that, when mature, encourages and attracts bird populations.\n \n* Buckwheat. Common buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum) is a bushy, squat annual that reaches a height of 2 to 5 feet when fully mature. Nursery-stock producers use buckwheat as a temporary green-manure crop from mid-spring to early July after spring digging and before they line out and replant new fields. Buckwheat can grow between 45 and 105F, with 80F being the optimum. Plant it and allow it to grow at least 12 weeks before the onset of frost.\n \nPerennial grasses Perennial grasses can function as temporary covers before seeding a desired permanent turf. Most perennial grasses have extensive root systems able to tolerate droughty, infertile soils, making them adaptable in disturbed sites.\n \n* Tall fescue. Tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea) is an important cool-season turfgrass used extensively in temporary conservation mixes. A perennial, tufted bunchgrass, this species exhibits an extensive root system and the ability to establish quickly. The deep root system of tall fescue enables persistence in both wet and dry soils. By the 1940s, the USDA Soil Conservation Service recognized the versatility and benefit of the season-long growth of tall fescue, thus making it a more frequent component of conservation mixes. Tall fescue prefers warm soils for establishment and can continue growth when other cool-season grasses have slowed their activity. This makes it a nice addition to conservation mixes designed for both transitional and temperate regions of the United States. In warmer climates, it serves as a fall-seeded cover or as an overseeding grass while the permanent turf is dormant. In the North, tall fescue provides relatively good root growth in droughty, infertile soils such as roadsides and r eclamation mixes. However, its perennial qualities may be a disadvantage in certain circumstances, leading to its dominance of some conservation mixes.\n \n* Perennial ryegrass. Perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) is a bunch-type grass significant to the southern overseeding markets. As a quick-establishing temporary cover, perennial ryegrass, whether a common or improved turf-type variety, provides a green surface on which athletic and recreational activities can continue when the permanent turf is dormant. As a temporary grass, it protects dormant warm-season turf and supports recovery and recuperation from wear. In northern climates, its perennial nature and aggressiveness make it undesirable as a temporary cover unless you intend to till the site before seeding with the permanent crop.\n \nWhen you determine that you need to use a cover crop, your first priority is to select a crop that solves the immediate soil-erosion problem. A consideration of other, secondary needs and factors should lead your final selection of a species or mix of species. What is most important to the site? Erosion control only? Aesthetics? Preservation of bird and animal habitat? Consider the desired effect of the cover crop on the surrounding environment to determine the best selection. Also, consider the effects of cover crops on establishment of the permanent crop you intend to use.\n \nFinally, remember that this article only discusses grasses. Many other excellent, non-grass cover crops are available, especially legumes. Consult a local distributor. \n"

			"body": "\nIncreasing Fertility\n\nImproving the soil’s fertility makes it less likely to blow or wash away. As an additional benefit, fertile soil creates better growing conditions for slope-stabilizing vegetation. Avoid using chemicals, which can contribute to harmful run-off, and amend the soil using natural materials. Organic choices include sphagnum peat, compost, decomposed manure, grass clippings, straw, sawdust and wood ash. Man-made amendments include sand, vermiculite, shredded tires, gravel or perlite. All increase the soil’s ability to retain moisture, nutrients and air.\n\n \nStrengthening the Surface\n\nOne of the most effective -- and attractive -- ways to stabilize loose soil is through plants. Plants’ roots stabilize the soil from below, while vegetation above the ground prevents erosion. Drought-resistant plants with spreading, fibrous root systems work well. Whenever possible, choose species native to your region, as they require less irrigation and fertilizer, both of which contribute to harmful run-off. Native North American choices include groundcovers such as bunchberry, Canada anemone, sedge, violets, wild ginger and woods phlox. North American ornamental grasses include big and little bluestem, Indian grass, June grass, needle grass and switch grass. Trees and shrubs native to North America include black locust, pines, river birch and willows.\n\n"

			"body": "\nGrassed Swales\n \nA grassed swale is a graded and engineered landscape feature appearing as a linear, shallow, open channel with trapezoidal or parabolic shape. The swale is vegetated with flood tolerant, erosion resistant plants.\n\nThe design of grassed swales promotes the conveyance of storm water at a slower, controlled rate and acts as a filter medium removing pollutants and allowing stormwater infiltration.\n\nWhen properly designed to accommodate a predetermined storm event volume, a grassed swale results in a significant improvement over the traditional drainage ditch in both slowing and cleaning of water.\n\nIn swales, stormwater is slowed by strategic placement of check-dams [ 446 KB pdf file], new window] that encourage ponding and these ponds in turn facilitates water quality improvements through infiltration, filtration and sedimentary deposition. Collected stormwater is expected to drain away through the soil within several hours or days.\n\n\nGrass Swale with Check Dams. \n Note significant channel storage capacity created by check dams. \n Notched center allows safe overflow without scour around sides.\n (image from Virginia Stormwater Management Program\n\nHere are some additional examples of grassed swales and check dams.\n\n \n \n\nApplications  \n\nGrassed Swales are an appropriate stormwater management practice for most regions of North America. Swales are a low cost low maintenance option to remove sediments, nutrients and pollutants. They increase stormwater infiltration and add a visually aesthetic component to a site.\n\nEstablishment of grassed swales is a potential solution wherever stormwater needs to be transported from impervious surfaces, slowed down and allowed to infiltrate into soils. \n\nExceptions to their use are in desert like areas where irrigation would be required for long-term maintenance and in colder regions with permafrost where infiltration is minimal. \n\nIn northern climates without permafrost, design and maintenance requirements should be modified with respect to a shorter growing season, management of meltwater and depth of frost in soil (see details in section on Tips and Wisdom).\n\nTypically grassed swales are used as an environmentally preferential solution or sometimes as an enhancement to the more traditional curb and gutter based storm sewer system. The linear structure of swales favors their use in the treatment of runoff from highways, residential roadways and common areas in residential sub-divisions, along property boundaries and in and around parking lots.\n\n\nFrom: Puget Sound, WA Action Team \n\nGenerally grassed swales are used to treat relatively small drainage areas of five acres or less. In highly urbanized areas or other highly impervious areas grass swales are not recommended unless constructed in series or function as pretreatment for other stormwater management practices.\n\nAdvantages of correctly designed grassed swales:\n•Dry Swales ◦Trap and remove sediments and other pollutants and thus improve water quality.\n◦Reduce peak runoff velocity and promote infiltration. \n◦Reduce erosion.\n◦Provide for some groundwater recharge if correctly designed.\n◦Are favored for use for treating highway and residential road runoff because of their linear structure. Good to use in replacement of existing drainage ditches.\n◦Are best if used in low to moderate density developments. \n◦Are useful as a means of disrupting impervious pavement in parking areas.\n◦Has ponding of water for only a short time with little increase in water temperature thus useful in watersheds containing cold-water trout streams.  \n◦Are less expensive to build and maintain (easy to mow) than a traditional curb and gutter system. \n\n•Wet Swales ◦Function as a linear wetlands\n◦Reduce peak flows and runoff velocity and promote infiltration.\n◦Reduce erosion.\n◦Are easy to design. Can be built in relatively impervious soils or in seasonally saturated soils or intersecting water table\n◦Trap and remove sediments and other pollutants with increased efficiency and thus improve water quality.\n◦Create visually appealing and beneficial habitat between uplands and surface waters\n◦Are less expensive to build and maintain than a traditional curb and gutter system \n◦Provide effective pretreatment of stormwater passing through for further processing by additional stormwater management practices.\n\n\n\nSwale Cross-sections (click image to enlarge)\nFrom: MPCA stormwater manual 2005 [ 1.7 MB]\n -click image to enlarge-\n\n \n \nExamples \n    \n \n\n\nMaterials and Installation 1.The successful, properly functioning grassed swale is dependant on good engineering design. ◦Refer to the State of Minnesota Stormwater Manual - 2005, Chapter 12-7: Infiltration Practice Guidance [  1.2 MB] to find an excellent discussion on siting and engineering design of infiltration Best Management Practices in Minnesota.\n\n2.Geo-technical testing of soil is recommended to establish soil porosity and identification of location of close-to-surface bedrock outcrops that may require re-location of swale. \n3.Be certain that local authorities have been approached for: ◦An understanding of requirements (Some cities have manuals or fact sheets available) \n◦Permits and inspections required \n\n4.Siting and Design ◦A suggested design process [ 2.7 MB] includes the following steps: ◾Compute water quality treatment volume (WQV) for surfaces to be treated as required by local authorities and/or permitting agencies\n◾Determine the swales dimensions ( bottom width, depth, length and slope) required to store the WQV in a shallow ponding depth (18” maximum depth)\n◾Compute the WQV drawdown time to ensure it is less than 24 hours\n◾Compute the 2 and 10 year frequency storm event peak discharges\n◾Check the 2 year storm velocity for potential to cause erosion, adjust swale geometry if necessary and reevaluate WQV design parameters\n◾Check the 10 year storm for depth and velocity, adjust swale geometry if necessary and reevaluate WQV and 2 year design parameters\n◾Provide minimum of 6” freeboard (height of channel sides above water surface) above 10 year stormwater surface profile \n\n◦A reference to find needed design calculations is: Design of Stormwater Filtering Systems (1996) by Claytor and Schueler; Center for Watershed Protection and Chesapeake Bay Research Consortium; Ellicott City and Solomons, MD.\n\n Additional references to help understand complexities of design can be found in a number of municipal, state and non-governmental organizations who provide Best Stormwater Management information. These are offered only as a means of emphasizing and confirming the complexity of national stormwater infiltration issues and that requirements are typical throughout the nation. \n◦To slow water flow in order to prohibit erosion of swale, check dams may have to be designed and added to grassed swales. Check dams not only slow water velocity but encourage ponding of water on the upstream side of each dam, hereby encouraging infiltration of stormwater; their design criteria: ◾Should be a maximum of 18 inches in height and height should not exceed half the height of swale bank.\n◾Spacing will depend on both the longitudinal slope of the swale and height of swale combining to provide desired WQV behind the dams.\n◾Anchoring of dams is necessary to prevent washout. Each side of the dam needs to extend two – three feet into the swale wall on both sides.\n◾The downstream side of check dams need to be protected from scour with sufficiently sized rip rap placed over geotechnical fabric.\n◾Check dams should be notched at their top to allow passage of two year design storm and a six inch freeboard to the top of the swale to handle a 10 year design storm.\n◾Check dams can be made from wood (pressure treated 6”x 6” or 8”x 8” or water resistant logs e.g. cedar) placed on top of a rock base. Concrete, gabions or rip rap (sufficiently sized to withstand flow of water) are used successfully also. [view images] \n\n◦Additional design considerations for structural components of Grassed swales: ◾At the point of inflow into the swale a pretreatment and sediment collection forebay can be designed. It should be able to contain 25% of the WQV. The installation of a rip rap pretreatment area contained by a check dam built on a stone base will serve the required function. [view image] \n◾At the end of a dry grassed swale the installation of a check dam can be combined with a pea gravel filled basin that leads excessive water to the underdrain system. Output from this underdrain must be managed. \n\n◦Culverts can be used to maintain swale connectivity where a road is planned to cross the swale. The culvert must be sized sufficiently large to accept the swales design flow for the10 year storm. Rip rap should be placed at the culvert entrance to reduce erosion. ◾In cold climates culverts should have a minimum diameter of 18 inches and a minimum slope of one percent to help keep water moving and prevent blockages.\n◾Wintertime maintenance is a must-do to avoid potential flooding. In areas that exceed frost depths greater than five feet and/or snow depths over eight feet need to posses a portable steamer to clear blocked culverts. \n\n\n5.Construction ◦Accurate grading is essential to construction of a properly functioning grassed swale. \n◦Machinery used for excavation and grading should not be driven over the swale site since compaction of soil is likely to occur. \n◦The swale site should be protected from storm water runoff that will cause erosion and sedimentation during construction. Final grading and planting should not occur until the adjoining areas draining into the swale are stabilized. \n◦Any accumulation of sediments that does occur must be removed during the final stages of grading. \n◦In dry swales the bottom should be tilled to produce a highly porous surface. \n◦Installation of erosion control matting or blanketing to stabilize soil during establishment of vegetation is highly recommended. ◾In colder climates with short growing seasons (less than 5 months) the desired level of establishment of vegetation may take two to three growing seasons. Careful maintenance of erosion control practices must continue for the duration. \n\n\n6.Vegetation Selection and Planting ◦Type of vegetation selected must take into account: ◾Soils conditions.\n◾Climate – plants have to be sufficiently hardy to withstand the most extreme conditions to occur in the local region. \n◾Topography- vegetation must be able to withstand forces created by flowing water.\n◾Available sunlight \n\n◦Selected vegetation must meet the following criteria: ◾Have a deep root system or form dense sod to resist scouring.\n◾Be vigorous growers.\n◾Have a high stem density to help slow water and facilitate sedimentation.\n◾Be tolerant to flooding and be able to survive and continue to grow after the inundation period. Water velocities associated with a two year design storm should not scour out planted materials nor should plants leaves matted down by water (will reduce amount of sediment removal).   \n◾If to be used near a road the plants must also be salt tolerant. \n\n◦Contact local area horticulturist and specialists in native plantings for recommended species used in grassed swales. Refer to published lists [ 75 KB] of salt tolerant plants from a variety of habitats that are suitable for both dry and wet swales constructed in northern climes. For additional information on plant salt tolerance and plants useful in cold climates see Appendix E [ 2.2 MB] in the Minnesota Stormwater Manual (2005). \n◦Some commonly used grasses for dry swales are: ◾Park grade Kentucky bluegrass or fescue or Creeping bentgrass(If regularly mowed)\n◾Native grasses – switchgrass, big bluestem, little bluestem, Indian grass or side-oats grama (typically mowed seasonally). Their use will increase diversity of animals and their extensive root systems promote drought tolerance and better filtration. On the negative side the swale will take a longer time to become established. The use of cover crops and/or soil stabilization techniques will be required. \n◾A mixture of native grasses can be visually appealing and provide variety of texture and color throughout the seasons.\n◾Do not use  invasive species like reed canary grass. \n\n◦Planting can be accomplished by the use of sod or by seeding (preferably hydro-seeding [ 240 KB]).\n◦Soil preparation includes: ◾Prepare top three inches of soil to provide sufficient aeration to allow rapid root growth. \n◾Add appropriate types of fertilizer and apply at prescribed rate to encourage rapid growth. \n◾Sod rolls are laid perpendicular to slope to assist in erosion control. Sod edges should butt against each other and vertical joints staggered (look like a brick wall). [view image]\n◾The laid sod should then be inspected for gaps  and foreign materials then rolled to ensure root surfaces are in contact with soil.\n◾Installation of erosion control matting is strongly encouraged until vegetation is well established.\n◾Water well at least two to three times in the first few weeks. \n◾Well established sod can be identified by grasping laid sod and tugging upwards. If the sod layer does not pull away from the soil layer then the sod can be considered well established, this should take two to three weeks.\n◾With hydro-seeding a well established vegetation mat will take longer to develop and depend on weather conditions and frequency of watering. \n\n\n7.Maintenance ◦Proper maintenance of grassed swales is essential. A maintenance contract with required maintenance steps delineated has been a successful approach. \n◦A recommended program would involve the following: ◾Mowing of dried swales as required seasonally to maintain the desired height of vegetation at three to four inches. Mowing grass too short and incorrectly applying lawn chemicals will jeopardize function.\n◾At least once a year and more often if required: ◾Inspection for erosion. Any obvious damage to grass or to the swales bottom soil bed should be repaired immediately. Seeded swales will require periodic re-seeding. Repairs need to conform to original swale design.\n◾Remove trash and other debris from all parts of the swale.\n◾If selected grass for swale is not performing select and plant a new grass.\n◾For wet swales replant with a revised selection of wetland plants if current plants are establishing slowly or failing.\n\n◾On as needed basis: ◾Till soil at swales bottom if water does not drain out within 48 hours (swales should drain within 24 hours).\n◾Remove sediment build up when the swales volume is reduced by 25 percent.\n\n◾In colder climates after spring snow melt: ◾Any collected sand from winter time sanding must be removed.\n◾Replacement of damaged vegetation should occur as soon as possible.\n◾Additions of mulch (added organic matter) may be required if drainage to swale is from roadway or parking lot. Deicing salts can damage soil structure by reducing soils organic matter. \n\n\n◦Maintenance responsibility is normally that of the owner. \n\n8.Cost ◦ Swales are a relatively cheap alternative to curb and gutter treatment. Swale maintenance is more frequently required but these costs are considerably cheaper than for curb and gutter systems maintenance. \n◦Swale construction costs have not been well studied. Costs will differ regionally and with site conditions. A best estimate has been made of $0.50 per square foot (2002 dollars). An undated estimate (no older than 2000) suggests a value of $5.50 per cubic foot of storage provided. \n\n \n\nSuggested References: Guidebooks, websites and pamphlets \n\n[ = pdf file; it will be opened in a new window] \n1.The Urban Small Sites Best Management Practices (BMP) Manual (2003) by the Metropolitan Council of Minnesota’s Twin Cities offers detailed information on 40 BMPs for stormwater pollution management in a cold-climate setting.\n Download their information on dry swales [ 2.7 MB] and wet swales [ 1.9 MB]. \n 2.Post-Construction Storm Water Management in New Development & Redevelopment – Grassed Swales (2002) by the USEPA; a good review of Grassed Swale knowledge and practices.

Virginia Stormwater Management Handbook (1999) produced by the Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation; an example of a very detailed stormwater management (BMP) manual. Strong on engineering and construction detail. Also a useful collection of images depicting grassed swales; find minimum standards for grassed swales in Chapter 3 [ 741 KB].\n4.State of Minnesota Stormwater Manual-2005 is a valuable tool for stormwater managers. The manual provides details on stormwater management practices applicable to Minnesota that conserves, enhances, and restores high-quality water in our lakes, rivers, streams, wetlands, and ground water. \n Go to the chapter on Infiltration Practices [ 1.2 MB], \nAppendix D-6: Infiltration Practices CADD Details [ 1.5 MB] and \n Appendix E: Minnesota Plant List and Application [ 2.2 MB] for details that apply to Grassed Swales.\n \n\nTips and Wisdom \n Grassed swales have minimal ‘hard structure’ to be impacted by freeze conditions and snow and therefore a useful Best Management Practice. Suggested cold climate adjustments deal with frost depth, snow meltwater volume and a shortened growing season; considerations include: \n•Plowing adjoining areas after snowfall must be carried out in a judicious manner to prevent damage to the swale’s edge structure and subsequent erosion. A modest set back and flag marking of the swale are measures that can help.  \n•Providing for a five foot setback to prevent frost heave of roads and parking lots in climate zones where frost depth exceeds five feet and soils are clay or silt structure. \n•Do not use grassed swales in areas of permafrost. \n•Salt tolerant plants must be chosen for swales placed along roadways. \n•Short growing seasons are typical of colder climates. Two seasons may be required for establishment of vegetation. During this period erosion control practices such as mats or blankets must protect swale structure. \n•Grassed swales can be used for snow storage and are important in reducing snow melt peak flows through infiltration and in treating most pollutants associated with snow. However, extra maintenance will be required to deal with the sand and de-icing compounds used on roadways and parking lots: ◦If swales are to be used for snow storage, plant selections must be salt tolerant. \n\n\n \n \n\nLimitations \n•Grassed swales are not recommended for large drainage areas.\n•Grassed swales are a cheap alternative to curbs and gutters; however their efficacy is dependant on careful design and construction, a thoughtful selection of plants as well as provision of dependable maintenance over time. Badly designed grass swales will not remove significant quantities of pollutants.\n•If vegetation is not sufficiently established the swale will not function.\n•Given the importance of design and construction, selection of engineering services and a construction company should be based on proven, successful past experience with swales and recommendations from past clients who have had swales installed. \n•Wet swales should not be used in high density residential areas because of potential for mosquito generation and smells. \n•Grassed swales are not the best management practice for: ◦Ultra urban areas because the areas of pervious surfaces required for swale development are usually unavailable. \n◦Stormwater hot spots where land use will generate stormwater with high levels of contaminants. Good examples of hot spots would be gas stations and convenience stores.\n\n•In cold weather climates, adjustments to design and maintenance must occur to deal with high snow loads and significant frost depths. \n \n"

Preparation is crucial when it comes time to lay a turf lawn. •Get rid of any weeds. Use a strong weed killer, if needed. \n\nImage titled Lay a Turf Lawn Step 1Bullet1\n \n•Remove large rocks, stones, tree roots, old turf and any other possible debris from the ground. \n\nImage titled Lay a Turf Lawn Step 1Bullet2\n \n•Cultivate the soil with a spade to a depth of about 6 inches (15.2 cm). \n\nImage titled Lay a Turf Lawn Step 1Bullet3\n \n•Level the ground with a rake. Add topsoil if needed. Stamp down the area with your feet, and then rake again. Slope the ground gently away from the house and any other structure, such as sheds, decks or patios. \n\nImage titled Lay a Turf Lawn Step 1Bullet4\n \n•Spread a fertilizer over the prepared ground. \n\nImage titled Lay a Turf Lawn Step 1Bullet5\n \n \n\n \n \n\n\n\nImage titled Lay a Turf Lawn Step 2\n \n2\n\n\nMark the lawn so you know exactly where you will lay the turf. Pound wooden stakes into the ground at each corner of the yard and use string or builder’s line to outline where you will be placing the turf. \n\n\n\n3\n\n\nBegin at the longest edge of the lawn. Start with a single roll of turf and unroll it so the longest side is parallel to the longest edge of the lawn. •Stagger each roll of turf as you go along to avoid a single line of edges or joints across the lawn. Some compare staggering turfs to the way you would stagger bricks when putting up a brick wall. \n\nImage titled Lay a Turf Lawn Step 3Bullet1\n \n•Use a knife or blade to cut the rolls of turf as needed. \n\nImage titled Lay a Turf Lawn Step 3Bullet2\n \n•Butt one edge of turf up against another. Use a rake to pull edges close to one another. Do not overlap turfs. \n\nImage titled Lay a Turf Lawn Step 3Bullet3\n \n\n\n\n\nImage titled Lay a Turf Lawn Step 4\n \n4\n\n\nFill any gaps with topsoil once you have completed laying the turfs. Cut pieces of turfs you have trimmed to fill in large gaps. Also repair any hollow spots under turfs by lifting and filling with topsoil. \n\n\n\n\nImage titled Lay a Turf Lawn Step 5\n \n5\n\n\nWater the turf lawn immediately. It is recommended that the first watering should soak the layer of topsoil or ground the turf is installed upon. \n\n\n \n\n  \n\n\nImage titled Lay a Turf Lawn Step 6\n \n6\n\n\nContinue watering three to four times per day for the next four weeks. It is not necessary to soak the topsoil after the first watering, as this can cause soil damage. Cut back on the frequency of watering once you can pull up on a turf without it lifting. \n"

			"body": "Constructing a Swale in 7 Steps\n\nStep 1: Observe Water on the Site\n\nThe goal of managing rainwater is to hold it as high in the landscape as possible for maximum efficiency and absorption. As water flows across a typical surface or landscape, most of it will run off quickly without having a chance to be absorbed by the soil. With a swale or other earthwork such as a rain garden, the water flows into the trench, where it sits and slowly soaks deep into the soil, producing little-to-no runoff.\n\nCollect information about your yard or property of interest. Where is the water coming from and to where is it going? \n\nSome observations to make about your property:\n•Identify springs, creeks, ponds, wetlands, wells, cisterns\n•Identify seasonal flows or standing water\n•Identify where water is wasted\n•Observe drainage patterns\n•Locate steep slopes\n•Determine how much water is needed if irrigation is the goal\n•Determine quality of sources/water pollution\n•Determine annual rainfall\n•Calculate roofwater catchment area (if applicable). For example, my roof area is 1,200 square feet.\n\nCapturing water in the landscape is often the easiest and most efficient way to store it. Swales help us do that. Learn how to choose the best site for a swale and how to build one.\nour front yard swale construction, 2011\n\nStep 2: Identify the Ideal Site for a Swale\n\nRules for siting a swale:\n•10 feet away from a building (water must drain away from building)\n•18 feet away from the edge of a steep slope or septic drain field\n•Uphill from a low spot that doesn’t drain well\n•An infiltration test demonstrates an infiltration rate of at least 1 inch per hour.\n\nSwales may not be appropriate for areas with a high water table or on extremely steep slopes.\n\nMultiple swales can be constructed if there is space and a need for them. A good rule of thumb is 18 feet apart–farther apart in flatter areas and perhaps closer together on a slope.\n\nStep 3: Mark the contour line.\n\nUse a contour level and utility flags to mark the contour line every 6 feet. This video will show you how to use a simple, homemade A-frame level to mark the contour lines.\n\n\n\nStep 4: Dig the trench along the marked contour line.\n\nSwale dimensions depend on a lot of variables. If you’re digging this swale by hand with a shovel, I bet you’re going to make the smallest swale you can manage! A backhoe will make the job easier if you have access. We dug ours by hand and it took about a month working weekends.\n\nThe standard range of size for a swale trench includes a depth of between 6 inches and 1.5 feet deep; and a width of between 18 inches and 2 feet wide. The length will depend on how large your space is, and whether you’re catching roof water or not.\n\nStep 5: Mound the soil from the trench on the downhill side to create a berm.\n\nTake the soil dug from the trench and place in on the downhill side.\n\nStep 6: Test and Adjust the Swale.\n\nFirst, work the A-frame level along the bottom of the trench to test whether it is level. Fix uneven spots. Next, observe the swale during a heavy rain event. How did it do?\n\nIf it overflowed, then do one of the following: Make the swale deeper, wider, or longer; or (last ditch effort!) dig another swale 18 feet or so below that one along the contour. Multiple swales are connected by a spillway, which is a notch in the berm where overflow can be directed. Spillways are usually lined with rocks to prevent erosion as the water spills from one swale into the next.\n\n\nStep 7: Plant the Berm.\n\nPlant the berm as soon as you know the swale is level and is the right size for the job.\n\nI especially like strawberries (3-foot-deep roots), asparagus (6-feet-deep roots), or rhubarb (10-feet-deep roots) because their roots are guaranteed to capture the water from the swale and slow it down. Fruit trees have shallow roots that reach wide, holding the topsoil intact, but be sure to plant them with deep-rooted herbaceous plants to better stabilize the berm as a whole. Adding some berry-producing nitrogen-fixing shrubs would make an excellent combination. Perennial sunflowers are also a good choice.\n\nI like the edible options, but your swale berm might also serve as a windbreak, privacy fence, native habitat or whatever else you can dream up! A swale berm could make a nice hedgerow.\n\n\nSwale Aesthetics\n\nSwales can be aesthetically-pleasing, if necessary, for the residential yard. Fill the trench with gravel and you have a walkable pathway. Just be sure to lay down weed blocker fabric on all sides before dumping in the gravel! Give the berm a rock border, and you have a raised bed. I topped my walkable trench with 4 inches of wood chips because I didn’t like cleaning fall leaves off of gravel.\n\nIf your swale is located in an underused area and does not need to be walkable, then you might consider seeding clover seed in the trench. At the very least, put a layer of straw in the trench to reduce evaporation.\n\nswales in the landscape part 1\nThis is our front yard swale. The trench is on the left, topped with wood chips so it can double as a walking path. The berm is on the right, densely planted with strawberries, and given a rock border for aesthetics.\n\nUsing a Swale for Roof Water Catchment\n\nCatching roof water is a little more serious than capturing water that naturally runs across the landscape because of the high volume of water coming down at one time.\n\nThere are two ways to go about digging a swale for roof water catchment: A precise, calculated kind of way, and a “wing it” kind of way.\n\nThe “Wing It” Way to Catch Roof Water in a Swale\n\nIf you’d like to wing it, be sure you’ve already chosen an appropriate site (water drains away from your house and your neighbor’s house) and you’ve done an infiltration test (see above) to make sure that the collected water will infiltrate the soil and drain well. Dig a swale trench around 12 inches deep, 2 ½-feet wide, and 20 feet long (or so). Construct a spillway about as wide as your trench as a starting point. Direct your gutter into the swale, then observe during a heavy rain event.\n\nPreciseness isn’t usually necessary because as long as you’re not going to flood the house, you can make adjustments after observing how it performs, by making the swale trench deeper, wider, or longer.\n\nThe “Geek” Way to Catch Roof Water in a Swale\n\nIf you’re a numbers kind of person, here is the way that I like to calculate for a roof catchment swale:\n\n#1: Start with this equation: Square Feet of Rooftop X .1 = Volume in cubic feet your swale needs to hold in a 1.0″ rain event.\n\nFor my roof: Half of my 1200-square-foot roof drains to the front yard (600 feet). The volume of water my front yard swale needs to hold is 60 Cubic Feet.\n\n#2: Next figure out how deep, wide, and long to make the swale trench to hold that volume of water. Since the trench of my swale is going to be a walkable path, I want it to be a minimum of two feet wide.\n\nThis equation will help you find the right proportions (in feet):\n Cubic feet = Length x Width x Height\n\nI wanted to find out how long to make my swale, given that it needs to hold 60 cubic feet of water, be a minimum of two feet wide, and just one foot deep (to reduce the amount of digging in the deep layers of hard clay):\n\n60 cubic feet = ? Length x 2 feet wide x 1 foot deep\n Length = 30 feet long\n\nProblem Solving for Swales that Catch Roof Water\n\nWhat if you don’t have the space for a 30-foot-long swale? I don’t! Let’s play with the numbers. I can make the trench wider for better absorption. Let’s adjust the width of my trench from 2 to 2.5 feet wide.\n\n60 cubic feet = ? Length x 2.5 feet wide x 1 foot deep\n Length = 24 feet long\n\nIn our case, we didn’t have space for a 24-foot-long swale either. So we dug the swale trench as close to the ideal size as we could, mounding the soil from the trench on the downhill side for the berm.\n\nThen we observed it during a hard rain. It didn’t overflow, but building in redundancy ensured that the system was robust and could handle a 100-year rain event.\n\nWe directed the overflow into a rain garden to accommodate any excess water due to the shorter-than-ideal length of swale. You can also direct a spillway into another swale, but we didn’t have space for a second swale in our yard.\n\nOnce your system is solid and doesn’t overflow, you can proceed to plant the berm and fill in the trench if it will be a walkable path.\n\nHere’s a picture of our front yard before we added the water catchment system and gardens:\n\nOur house before we purchased it (2005).\nOur house before we purchased it (2005).\n\nAfter we added the water catchment system and perennial plantings to slow the water, spread it, store it, and lock in moisture, it now looks like this:\n\nOur house 2013\nOur front yard 2013\n\nThis is the effect that storing water in the ground can have on soil health and moisture retention. It will absolutely work more efficiently than any above-ground rain catchment system. Nature always does it best!\n"
