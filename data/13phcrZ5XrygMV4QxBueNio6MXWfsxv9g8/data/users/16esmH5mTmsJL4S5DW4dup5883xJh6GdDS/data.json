With cheep archives of zetabites  of data scattered it's much harder for the powers that be to censor and in turn steal from the populous.. The core of our current problem is a distribution one. \n> Hope these help\n> disk space costs less than bandwidth, and both cost less than timehttps://www.mail-archive.com/kragen-tol@canonical.org/msg00258.html\n> ultraslow radio for decentralized global digital communicationhttps://www.mail-archive.com/kragen-tol@canonical.org/msg00303.html\n> freedom of communication will stop wars\n> https://www.mail-archive.com/kragen-tol@canonical.org/msg00211.html\n> mechanical computation: with Merkle gates, height fields, and threadhttps://www.mail-archive.com/kragen-tol@canonical.org/msg00249.html\n> Kragen Javier Sitaker Mon, 28 Jun 2010 00:37:07 -0700\n> One of the reasons I’m excited about automated fabrication(e.g. f...@home, tabletop CNC mills, RepRap, inkjet-printing ofcircuits, fused deposition modeling) is that I expect it will make itpossible to build computers from raw materials with minimal capital.It will be some time before those computers are as cheap or as fast asmass-produced microcontrollers, so they will start out as curiosities.But how far away is the prospect of automatically building a workingcomputer from raw materials with minimal capital?  I think it’salready possible.\n> This post considers three kinds of mechanical computers: one usingMerkle’s [buckling logic] [Merkle 1990], one using mechanicalheight fields, and one using pulling of threads.\n> Organic semiconductors, nonlinear acoustic devices, fluidic logic, orsomething more exotic, might turn out to be the form that computersmade by 3-D printers eventually take; but I’m pretty sure Merkle’sapproach is workable.  So I’m going to consider that first. And I wantto describe some ideas of my own.\n> Unfortunately, I don’t know shit about mechanical engineering.  If anyactual mechanical engineer is annoyed at my ignorant speculations whenthey read this, I’d be delighted to hear about all the things I’m\n> getting wrong.\n> ~ message truncated \n> Other concepts to consider...Fluidics  ( fluid based logic / computers )Conlangs (constructed languages for information obfuscation much like encryption, laguage can be obscured by self defining your own. The trade off comes with broadcasting it [teaching and learning]  )DNA computers and information storagePhotonics computers ( computes working off of light, and mirrors etched in glass chips )\n> Quantum networking (experimental and expensive point to point network based on quantum entanglement that's uncensorable because theirs no intermediate data handler. )Gravitational wave networking (experimental and expensive point to point network based on the fact that gravitational waves pass through matter and thus are also uncensorable as they would be point to point but not as fast as quantum netorking wich is instantaneous )\n\nThis is something that I'm fairly interested in, though having good software that can bridge all of these various systems that can be used by the laypeople is super important. If someone's grandma can use it then anyone can.\n\nIf we can achieve it, alternative means of computation can be greatly beneficial. Especially if everyone can make use of it.",
