I didn't realize that even on my own blog I need to actively tick \"Comments\" in the Following box :)\n\nYou can see the blog's main URL at https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs/the_papers\n\nThen you can scroll down to find whatever date you need, clicking \"More Stories\" at the bottom to find older ones. Here's the original link for the 28th of March:\nhttps://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-the-papers-47728858\n\nYou'll notice all the images of newspapers are gone already from the original clearnet site.",

Here's 404 song: https://rutracker.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=5150048I used it for H.265 encoding tests. You can compress it to ~40 MB H.265 video without significant quality loss!\n\nI don't know if I'll go to the trouble of reencoding this myself (that's another thing on my list of things to learn), but thanks for the tip.\n\nFor now, what would be great is a solution to ZeroBlog not accepting embedding of WebM :)",
