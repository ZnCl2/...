			"body": "**Film, 1994, USA, d. Alex Proyas.** Language: English.\n\n*   [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/crow): Critics: 81%. Audience: 90%.\n*   [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109506/): 7.6.\n*   [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crow_(1994_film%29)\n*   Other links at bottom of article\n\nStarring: Brandon Lee, Rochelle Davis, Ernie Hudson, Michael Wincott, Bai Ling.\n\n> A vicious gang murders a young Goth couple and one year later the man rises from his grave to avenge his beloved.\n\n![The.Crow.1994.BrRip.720p.x264.YIFY.webp (1280x688)](data/img/post_45_The.Crow.1994.BrRip.720p.x264.YIFY.webp)\n\nFuck me, it's already been **25 years** since _The Crow_ came out! And it shows: the movie feels _very_ 90s (thanks especially to the grungey soundtrack) and, for me, hasn't aged as well as some of other early 90s movies I've watched recently. The whole premise feels very much a goth teenage male wish-fulfillment fantasy. (The fiancée was also murdered, and raped too. And watched her fiancé be murdered to boot. Why doesn't _she_ come back from the dead to exact vengeance?)\n\nWhile I liked _The Crow_ a lot the first time I saw it, now it's just \"OK\". Good action; so-so story and characters (although an order of magnitude better than Lee's other films _Rapid Fire_ and _Showdown in Little Tokyo_, which work only for hardcore action fans).\n\nAnd yes, this was the movie where Brandon Lee died; the scene in which his character Eric Draven was shot and killed was the same scene where Brandon Lee was shot and killed in real life, when a piece of a fake bullet stuck in the gun from a previous take was pushed out by a blank charge and hit Lee in the abdomen. That's what happens when you try to save money by shooting in a non-union state, working people around the clock and then sending the (expensive) arms master home before shooting a weapons scene to avoid paying him overtime.\n\n(Despite Draven's death happening at the beginning of the movie, it was one of the last bits to be filmed. As most of Lee's scenes had already been shot, _The Crow_ doesn't have the obvious & terrible fakery employed to hide the star's absence that was in [_Game of Death_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Death), the film his father [Bruce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Lee) was in the middle of when _he_ died.)\n\nWho knows how far Brandon could have gone had he lived?\n\n### Technical\n\nI watched a 720p, high-resolution-small-file size encode from YTS / YIFY. I tend to prefer getting these types of encode because I can keep the smaller files for longer on my hard drive and and share more of them.\n\nBut, while their video quality is good enough most of the time, it can be problematic with certain kinds of scenes:\n\n*   dark\n*   night-time\n*   rainy\n*   foggy\n\nAnd _The Crow_ is **all** dark, rainy, night-time scenes. I was getting [artifacts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compression_artifact) all over the place for most of the film. (I wasn't able to capture them in my screenshots though; but it's really noticeable when the images are moving.) So I would recommend you go for some other version.\n\n![The.Crow.1994.BrRip.720p.x264.YIFY.2.webp (1280x688)](data/img/post_45_The.Crow.1994.BrRip.720p.x264.YIFY.2.webp)\n\n* * *\n\n### Watch _The Crow_\n\n**Legitimate**\nNote: legit streaming & download availability varies with geography & time.\n\n*   [WatchPlayStream.com - _The Crow_](https://www.watchplaystream.com/en/movies/the-crow-1994/)\n*   [JustWatch (US) - _The Crow_](https://www.justwatch.com/us/search?q=the%20crow) (change for your country)\n*   [DuckDuckGo product search - Buy \"The Crow\" 1994](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=Buy+\"The+Crow\"+1994&t=vivaldi&ia=products)\n\n**Details and torrent of the release I watched**\n\nThe.Crow.1994.BrRip.720p.x264.YIFY.mkv\n\n*   [Magnet download](magnet:?xt=urn:btih:97E3B98732461836B660B0DC391291F55568EB88&dn=The.Crow.1994.BrRip.720p.x264.YIFY)\n*   Total size: 550MB.\n*   Video: MPEG4 Video (H264) 1280x688 25fps [V: The Crow - YIFY (h264 high L3.1, yuv420p, 1280x688) [default]]\n*   Audio: AAC 48000Hz stereo [A: The Crow - YIFY (aac he-aac, 48000 Hz, stereo) [default]]\n*   Subtitle: UTF-8 [S: The Crow - YIFY [eng] (subrip)]\n*   Screenshots: above.\n\n**Other releases of _The Crow_ available on BitTorrent**\n\n*   [\"Play\" - _The Crow_](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1PLAYgDQboKojowD3kwdb3CtWmWaokXvfp/?page=1&search=the%2Bcrow&imdb_id=tt0109506&title=The+Crow)\n*   [ZeroTorrent](http://127.0.0.1:43110/ZeroTorrent.bit/) - at time of writing, only has the sequel \"The Crow: City of Angels\".\n*   [Torrentz2.eu - The Crow 1994](https://torrentz2.eu/search?f=the+crow+1994)\n\n**Releases on ZeroNet**\n\n*   KopyKate, [IFS](http://127.0.0.1:43110/12MVkvYGcRW6u2NYbpfwVad1oQeyG4s9Er/index.html?view:search+id:the_crow): no results at time of writing."

And now someone has started killing those connected to that event...\n\nI chose this film as part of my checking out the free streaming service Tubi ([see this post](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1NEuAUKgUoY6fnXeXBaonjrDfNbfpQpdMp/?Post:39:Tubi+TV)). The previous film I saw (_Death Race 2000_, [see this post](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1NEuAUKgUoY6fnXeXBaonjrDfNbfpQpdMp/?Post:41:Death+Race+2000)) was an older film that was offered as a rather soft definition pan & scan 540p (probably converted from something made in the days of VHS tapes & 4:3 CRT televisions), so I went looking for something more recent to see if the video quality would be better.\n\nIn my market, Tubi's modern offerings seem to consist mostly of straight-to-video dross like _Bikini Model Academy_, so I had to dig a little to find something recent that looked interesting.\n\n_The Kill Hole_ seems to tick many of the boxes of Tubi's offerings in my market:\n\n*   I'd never heard of it\n*   It features an actor before they were famous (Chadwick Boseman before _Get On Up_ and _Black Panther_)\n*   It features actors _after_ they were famous (Billy Zane after his 90s heyday of _Titanic_, _The Phantom_ etc. Peter Greene after _The Mask_.)\n*   Demographic \"niche\" (in this case, featuring African-American leads)\n*   It bombed\n\nClearly, a lot of critics and moviegoers were not impressed with _The Kill Hole_. But I was: moving performances from the actors (and from the veterans in the support group, who are _not_ actors); beautiful cinematography and landscapes; a quality score by composer Jason Wells.\n\nWhile there are a few moments of action, this is essentially a drama about the aftermath of war, and one I found involving.\n\n**Technical**\nI watched it on Tubi and was offered a variety of resolutions including maximum of 720p (which is what I tend to watch other ways too, e.g. Netflix in browser, Bittorrent downloads).\n\nThe video quality was _way_ better than Tubi's offering of _Death Race 2000_: high definition, widescreen, crisp and clean.\n\nFurthermore, even though Tubi is supposedly supported by advertising, I wasn't bothered by a single advertisement in either movie: not before, during or after. I haven't even seen any ads on the website itself. And this is in bog-standard Chrome browser, with no ad-blocking extensions. I'm not sure how this is economically viable.\n\n* * *\n\n### Watch _The Kill Hole_\n\n**Legitimate**\nNote: legit streaming & download availability varies with geography & time.\n\n*   [Tubi - _The Kill Hole_](https://tubitv.com/movies/412222/the_kill_hole).

(Almost all from English-language film, television and comic books; although I did spot one, _maybe_ two, non-Anglophone sources). It's not great art, but it is great fan art, and a great game to play, trying to find every single character etc. Looking at it, I realized I recognized _way_ more things than is probably healthy ☻ How much of my life have I spent watching sci-fi?!?\n\nYou can see the whole illustration as well as as closeups of certain sections here on his site: [http://jeffcarlisle.com/image/tid/68](http://jeffcarlisle.com/image/tid/68)\n\nI'll also put up some images of it here, but unfortunately none of the images available online are very high resolution.

An article that popped up in my newsfeed reminded of one of my favourite shows ever, sci-fi or otherwise: **_Farscape_**, created by [Rockne S. O'Bannon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockne_S._O'Bannon) (who also created _Alien Nation_, _seaQuest_ and _Defiance_). Here it is:\n\n*   [**io9 - A Look Back at Farscape: Aliens, Puppets, and Criminals on the Run**](https://io9.gizmodo.com/a-look-back-at-farscape-aliens-puppets-and-criminals-1833716459) (also [backed up here on ZeroNet](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1CiXRY9ATZSoZqBzwMfXEMsKtPRt2aQoF2/data/users/131Seivv6aH8vnohPmYPcPwPfZ1a5ubMMs/io9-A.Look.Back.at.Farscape_-Aliens,Puppets,and.Criminals.on.the.Run.2019-04-04.html), in case the link dies or io9's parent company gets sued out of existence... [again](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bollea_v._Gawker))\n\n_Farscape_ is the story of astronaut John Crichton, thrown through a wormhole across the galaxy and who ends up as a fugitive and sole human on a living ship with a bunch of wanted criminals. It's fun, exciting, moving, innovative and at times completely bonkers :) But read the io9 article, as it's a far better explanation of why you should watch the show, even now as it celebrates its 20th anniversary.\n\nA quote from that article on _Farscape_'s legacy:\n\n> The passion of Farscape’s fanbase has far from died out, even two decades after the premiere—and many Farscape fans are now behind the camera for TV and film. Actor Ben Browder (John Crichton) told io9 how often showrunners and filmmakers will cite Farscape as a source of inspiration to him. “I’ve had conversations with [Bryan Fuller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Fuller) {_American Gods, ST:Discovery_} and…Farscape. [Russell T. Davies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_T_Davies) {_Doctor Who_}…Farscape. When I met [James Gunn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Gunn), I introduced myself and he said ‘I know who you are.’ And I said ‘Yeah, I thought you did because I saw your movie, bro.’” Gunn credits Farscape as a major influence on Guardians of the Galaxy—proving that although it was short-lived, Farscape’s legacy endures.\n\nYou might have noticed a key word in the article title, a feature of the show that might put a lot of people off.\n\n*   You: \"But it has [muppets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Muppets) in it!\"\n*   Me:\"Shut it! Those muppets convey more deep, adult emotion in a single episode of Farscape than the entire human casts of Voyager, Enterprise and SG-1 put together in their entire runs. **_You're_ the [muppet](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/muppet#Noun)!**\"\n\nOK, not a real conversation :) but _Farscape_ was often dismissed at a glance as a children's show because of its use of characters from the Jim Henson Workshop (which actually made for much more believable & expressive alien characters than turn-of-the century CGI or a bit of latex slapped on a human forehead _à la_ Star Trek). Broadcasters who just assumed it was a kids' show got burned and had to change its scheduling to a later hour or make big cuts once they realized there was a lot of adult content and themes.\n\nAlthough there are a few weak episodes in the first season (while the writers were still getting the hang of what they could do with a show that had so much freedom), _Farscape_ had some of the best story arcs and character development on television, still to this day.\n\nIt was broadcast in the same era as _The Sopranos_, which is often hailed as the beginning of the [new Golden Age of Television](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Age_of_Television_(2000s–present%29). And **I'd argue that _Farscape_, with its character development, story arcs, and morally ambiguous protagonists dealing with the consequences of their choices over entire _seasons_ (not neatly wrapped up in 43 minutes), deserves a place right alongside _The Sopranos_ at the start of that golden age.** Sure, _Farscape_ has its occasional kooky episode (because unlike a lot of TV sci-fi, it would really try to take big chances with something truly different) but Season 3 (a.k.a. \"the Season of Death\") in particular is still among the most powerful storytelling I've experienced across any media.\n\nAn episode of Farscape was the very first thing I ever downloaded by Bittorrent (I had just moved to another country where it wasn't on TV). And 15 years later it was among the first things I watched on Netflix (not available there any more). And it was still fun, exciting, moving, saddening, and impressive after all those years, even after watching _Battlestar Galactica_, _The Wire_ and _Breaking Bad_.

Only I've never watched it till now: I've just seen the screenshots and [animated GIFs of Denise Richards and Neve Campbell snogging in the pool](https://gifer.com/en/vnw), or the threesome they have with Matt Dillon, posted on the internet over and over again.\n\nI think the consensus is that the movie is cheesy trash but with a significant portion saying it's **great**, interesting, fresh, cheesy trash, with a great ensemble cast (Dillon, Campbell, Kevin Bacon, Richards, and the revered Bill Murray as a sleazy lawyer) doing great work.\n\nI think a year ago I read some article (which I can't find) celebrating its twentieth anniversary and making a case for its greatness so I finally decided to see where the GIFs came from :)\n\nAnd I enjoyed it. Not a movie I'd send into space so that aliens can judge our species by, but fun and maintaining suspense through to the end. And make sure you _do_ watch it to the end: important things happen even after the end credits have started rolling.\n\nOn a side note, being from 1998, it features [a completely unironic use of Smash Mouth](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/all-star).\n\n**Technical note**: there have been different edits of the film, with later releases having a few short scenes that explain a bit more about the characters. The original release is 1 hour 48 minutes, but the version I saw is 1 hour 55 minutes.\n\n* * *\n\n### Watch _Wild Things_\n\n**Legitimate**\n\n*   [DuckDuckGo product search - Buy Wild Things online](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=buy+\"Wild+Things\"+1998&t=vivaldi&ia=products)\n*   [Flixster](https://www.flixster.com/movie/wild-things/862b2d5c-956c-366c-8378-d0f8c5e06238)\n*   [JustWatch](https://www.justwatch.com/) - I can't link straight to the film, you have to choose your country first, then search for \"Wild Things\".\n\n**Details and torrent of the release I watched**\n\nWild.Things.1998.720p.BluRay.x264.YIFY.mp4\n\n*   🧲[Torrent magnet](magnet:?xt=urn:btih:EB93FC82385B416C5EDE5E8D2EE6587A1C20CD98&dn=Wild%20Things%20%281998%29)\n*   [ZeroTorrent](http://127.0.0.1:43110/ZeroTorrent.bit/?Topic:46_131Seivv6aH8vnohPmYPcPwPfZ1a5ubMMs/Wild+Things+1998+720p+BluRay+x264+YIFY+mp4)\n*   Total size: 817MB.\n*   Video: MPEG4 Video (H264) 1280x528 23.976fps 898kbps [V: video.264#trackID=1:fps=23.976 - Imported with GPAC 0.5.0-rev (h264 high L4.1, yuv420p, 1280x528, 898 kb/s)]\n*   Audio: AAC 48000Hz stereo 93kbps [A: English [eng] (aac lc, 48000 Hz, stereo, 93 kb/s)]\n*   Subtitles: None included.

Block bosses control just a few streets and preserve the old ways.\n\nIn 1984, teenager 蚊子 Wenzi (\"Mosquito\") moves to Monga. After a lifetime of being bullied, he finally finds a group who'll accept him: a gang formally led by 志龍 (\"Dragon\"), the teenage son of block boss Geta (so nicknamed for the Japanese clogs he wears and sometimes uses in fights) but driven by 和尚 (\"Monk\"). The 5 boys become \"sworn brothers\" and the youth wing of the Temple Front gang, who control the few blocks in front of the night market's big temple, and are historic enemies of the Back Alley gang, who control the streets behind the temple.\n\nWenzi and his brothers grow closer, but it can't be all camaraderie and good times. Over the next few years, consequences, resentment and ambition all come to a head in a devastating denouement. Especially as the old-school block bosses, concerned with their traditions of being local godfathers protecting their own small patches of turf, struggle to evolve in the face of large-scale professional organized crime encroaching on their little world.\n\nWhile it gets a little melodramatic at times, _Monga_ generally does a very good job telling a familiar story in a compelling way. And it was given many awards and honours, e.g. it was Taiwan's entry for Best Foreign Language Film for the 2010 Oscars (although it didn't make the shortlist). It even beat Hollywood behemoth Avatar at the box office on its day of release.\n\nAnd for me personally, it was interesting to see this dark underbelly of Taipei, going on just a few years before I lived there (and next to a night market, too!)\n\n*   [Review from VCinema](http://www.vcinemashow.com/film-review-monga-2010/)\n*   [Review from LoveHKfilm](http://www.lovehkfilm.com/panasia/monga.html)\n\n* * *\n\n### Watch _Monga_\n\n**Legitimate**\n\n*   [DuckDuckGo product search - Buy Monga online](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=monga+film+2010+buy&ia=products)\n\nI didn't have any luck finding legal streaming or downloads for this film, but I'll put a couple links here in case availability changes in the future.\n\n*   [Can I Stream It? - Monga](http://www.canistream.it/search/movie/monga)\n*   [Flixster- Monga](https://www.flixster.com/movie/monga/cccfb7fc-76fa-347f-ad2e-cbe928655dd4)\n\n**Details and torrent of the release I watched**\n\nMonga aka Bang kah (2010) 720p.BRrip.Sujaidr.mkv\n\n*   [ZeroTorrent](http://127.0.0.1:43110/ZeroTorrent.bit/?Topic:45_131Seivv6aH8vnohPmYPcPwPfZ1a5ubMMs/Monga+aka+Bang+kah+2010+720p+BRrip+Sujaidr+mkv)\n*   [Magnet download](magnet:?xt=urn:btih:91A161C23BA6DC7ACAE07A1122B0D1D24E856A30&dn=Monga%20aka%20Bang%20kah%20%282010%29%20720p.BRrip.Sujaidr&tr=udp%3a%2f%2ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3a6969&tr=udp%3a%2f%2fzer0day.ch%3a1337&tr=udp%3a%2f%2ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3a6969&tr=udp%3a%2f%2fpublic.popcorn-tracker.org%3a6969)\n*   Total size: 1.36GB\n*   Video: MPEG4 Video (H264) 1280x544 24fps [V: h264 high L4.1, yuv420p, 1280x544 [default]]\n*   Audio: Dolby AC3 48000Hz stereo 128kbps [A: ac3, 48000 Hz, stereo, 128 kb/s [default]]\n*   Subtitles: English, external .srt. _NOTE_: the English subtitles in this torrent were good, but not perfect.

The Times, The Guardian, The Daily Telegraph, Daily Mirror, Daily Mail, Daily Express, Financial Times, i, Daily Star. Plus their weekend/Sunday equivalents. Occasional: The Independent, Metro, City AM, others.\n\nAlso sometimes the blog post will mention and link to stories not shown on the front page, or even stories from papers whose front page is not shown that day.\n\nI find it a nice, quick way to get an overview of the wide variety of what's being said by all the different papers and not stay in an echo chamber, even if I often find myself grinding my teeth when I see The Grauniad and the Mirror's front pages (and often just shaking my head when I see the Express's or the Mail's).\n\nOn the day of release, it includes large captures of the actual front pages of the papers. However (probably for copyright/licensing reasons), those front pages disappear after one day, leaving just the text review of the papers' stories.\n\nSo here I have saved the post for Sunday the 24th of March, 2019, in .mhtml format. (The version saved is suitable for viewing on desktop computers.) This captures everything all into one file, so even when the BBC takes down the images of the front pages, you can still view them in the .mhtml file. (If you save the webpage as \".html only\", the file is smaller but when you try to view the page it will try call in resources like images from their original clearnet sources, and they'll be gone.) Set your file manager / operating system to open .mhtml files in your preferred browser.\n\n**EDIT: I'm continuing to save these blog posts on ZeroNet but they are now saved in all-in-one _.html_ (not .mhtml) using the [SingleFile](https://github.com/gildas-lormeau/SingleFile) browser extension.**\n\nAdjust the width of your browser window until the front page images are displayed clearly. (Image width: 976 pixels.)\n\nI'd really like to be able to script saving The Papers blog post on the day of release and publishing it on ZeroNet. But it's a \"responsive design\" page, which particularly affects the size and resolution of the images of the front pages: I have to adjust the browser window to just the right width and give time for each newspaper's front page to be displayed in the browser window before it finally loads the highest resolution version. I don't know if a script could take care of that."

I was either too young or not born yet for their earlier stuff which I didn't catch till much later, what with only 3-4 TV channels in the UK at the time and home media like VHS and Betamax (guess which we had at first) in its infancy. In fact, the main home media for TV show fans back in those days was... audio albums. \"Miss the show?

I can't for the life of me remember why I downloaded _The Incident_ but I'm glad I did.\n\n(When I noticed it sitting on my hard drive, I thought _maybe_ it was a psychological sci-fi film...? It ain't.)\n\n_The Incident_ is a powerful neo-noir drama/thriller set on one Sunday night/Monday morning in New York City. We see snapshots of various people's lives, with only one thing in common: they will all end up on the same subway car, and that will mean a night they will never forget, as a couple of young hoodlums out for trouble and a good time pick on (and pick apart) every other passenger there.\n\nFrom Rotten Tomatoes:\n\n> After mugging a helpless old man, switchblade-wielding punks Martin Sheen and Tony Musante take over a subway car, terrorizing its occupants. In Stagecoach fashion, all the best and worst qualities of the passengers are brought to the surface by the presence of danger.\n\nThe premise may seem unlikely to some nowadays, but coming only a few years after [the infamous Kitty Genovese murder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Kitty_Genovese), when an entire New York City block looked away as a young woman was slowly butchered on the street (with no one intervening, no one even calling the police), _The Incident_ captures a place and a time where no one would stick their neck out, no one would look trouble in the eye. And yet it still speaks about human tendencies today.\n\nI watched this only a few nights after [_Speed_](http://127.0.0.1:43110/ZeroTorrent.bit/?Topic:43_131Seivv6aH8vnohPmYPcPwPfZ1a5ubMMs/Speed+1994+1080p+BrRip+x264+BOKUTOX+YIFY) (1994, USA, d. Jan De Bont), another film centred on a group of terrorized people trapped on public transport. And while I had a great time watching _Speed_, _The Incident_ proves there's something even more disturbing than a fuckton of C4 strapped under your arse: _people_. And not just the bad people, but the \"normal\", even the \"good\" people (who it turns out ain't so great after all). Because the last time I checked, people are all around us, and C4... not so much.\n\nThe film features a great ensemble cast, led by Tony Musante (whose name I didn't recognize but whose face I did) and Martin Sheen (in his first ever film role) as the hoodlums, with Beau Bridges (_The Fabulous Baker Boys_), Brock Peters (_To Kill a Mockingbird_, _Start Trek: DS9_), Ed McMahon (!)(I never knew he did anything other than laugh at Johnny Carson's jokes on _The Tonight Show_), Donna Mills (_Knot's Landing_), Victor Arnold (_Shaft_), Ruby Dee (_Do the Right Thing_, _American Gangster_) and others you might recognize from their work as character actors or even leads over the years.\n\n**klu9's verdict: A great movie that's hard (& gripping) to watch.**\n\nTechnically, the cinematography isn't anything to write home about, but that isn't surprising given that it was an independent movie that lost funding part-way through (and was rescued by 20th Century Fox) and that the NYC Transit Authority didn't approve of \"terror on the subway\" movies, so the filmmakers had to get background & exterior shots etc by sneaking aboard cameras in shopping bags!\n\nAnd that's part of why I'd never heard of _The Incident_: its financial troubles, coupled with one negative pre-release review from _The New York Times_, led Fox to bury its release in an unfavourable slot with little marketing, and so it basically went unnoticed in the US. It's never even been released on home video there since a Laser Disc (!) in 1990!
