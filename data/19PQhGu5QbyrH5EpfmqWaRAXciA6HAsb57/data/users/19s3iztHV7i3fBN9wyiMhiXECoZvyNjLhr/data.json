He fights for free speech in university, against organized leftists who are pushing there political views as university study programs.\nYou may thing, that you are 'pure' opposition, but your opposition has no influence outside your head. The things that are pushed into media and universities determines our future. If you leave it as it is you will face the problem in ten or five years in such potency, that even if you stay conscious and sober minded, you will not be able to do anything except for knowing that 90% of population in your country are fools. These fools are going to tell you what you should think and what you should do in your personal 'free' life.\nBesides, he is much more educated and capable then most individuals that are proud having their own original opinion. He is making real influence in politics, media, university campuses. \nAnyway it is worth to know such people and to be more organized if you want to make some influence on your community future.",
