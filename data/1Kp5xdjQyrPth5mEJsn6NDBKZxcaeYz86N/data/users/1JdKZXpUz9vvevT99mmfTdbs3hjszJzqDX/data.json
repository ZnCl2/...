After that you can click on where it says _User_ at the top of NewZeroHello, login to another identity with your masterseed, then visit the ZeroID website to change ID's. Of course sub-identities would be very convenient since people could just switch ID's through a simple menu without having to logout then login again every time.",

Like it works on ZeroNet proxies?\n\nYes, it's like the proxies and works pretty well for throwaways until someone creates an ID system, or site, where two people can have the same username simultaneously with different seeds since no one can use a name that's already been registered through ZeroID.",
