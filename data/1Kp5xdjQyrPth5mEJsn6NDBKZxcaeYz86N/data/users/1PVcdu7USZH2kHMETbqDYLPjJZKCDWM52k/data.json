IMHO, next best feature to add would be an ability of modifying the poll by its author: rephrasing, deleting or adding new options to it. After a poll was edited users which have already voted on it see a notification with suggestion to change their vote.\n> It is really often situation when you add new poll and then suddenly realize that you forgot to add some options to it.\n\nYou would need to discard the old votes, otherwise you could fake polls easily. This would need to save the voting time for every vote.",
