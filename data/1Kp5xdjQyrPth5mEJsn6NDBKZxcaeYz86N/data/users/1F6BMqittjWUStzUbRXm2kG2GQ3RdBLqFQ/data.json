Haven't played any of the older titles, but X-Com 2 I got a bit addicted to for a while. The character customization alone can keep you occupied for hours! And then your best soldier dies and you reload a save game three times until she finally survives. Grrrr. Now I remember why I haven't played it in a while! :)\n\nAnyway, glad to see you again, Ekaterina!",
