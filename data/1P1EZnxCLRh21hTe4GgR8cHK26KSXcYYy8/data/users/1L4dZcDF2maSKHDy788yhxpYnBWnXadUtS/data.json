It is mentioned on ZeroMe Unfuck page: \"Never click \"Create Profile\" button again!\" Changing ZeroMe hubs unfortunately does not work, because one may loose old posts (they will not appear on ZeroMe). At least that is what happened to me. But new users may join your hub. I would consider creating new user profile, but that way i think i would loose track of old profile mentions from other users.",
