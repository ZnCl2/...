			"title": "BBC William Shakespeare's economic legacy",
			"date_published": 1461194750,
			"body": "\n<p class=\"story-body__introduction\">William Shakespeare may be widely regarded as finest playwright in the English language, but when he put his quill down he was also a savvy businessman.</p>\n<p>In Elizabethan London, the original Globe Theatre could accommodate 3,000 people. Commoners or \"groundlings\" paid a penny to stand in the open air, while the gentry parted with as many as six pennies to sit on cushions in the covered galleries.</p>\n<p>Notwithstanding the fact that the Globe burned down in 1613, Shakespeare's share in the playhouse made him a tidy fortune.</p>\n<p>He also part-owned another London theatre and a production company. And back in his hometown of Stratford-upon-Avon in Warwickshire, he invested widely in land and property, and reportedly bought and sold grain.</p>\n<p>By the time Shakespeare died on 23 April 1616 - 400 years ago on Saturday - he was a very wealthy man. In today's money he would have comfortably been a millionaire.</p>\n<p>Fast-forward four centuries, and Shakespeare would likely be rather pleased that his work and legacy continues to support a large and lucrative industry, which is far from being limited to the sale of theatre tickets and employment of actors.</p>\n<p>Instead, Shakespeare supports a substantially wider business community - from hotels and restaurants in Stratford, to walking tours in London, bars near a balcony in the Italian city of Verona, sales of books and memorabilia, and even leadership classes for businessmen and women. </p>\n<p>It is definitely not much ado about nothing.</p>\n<p>Piers Ibbotson says there are so many lessons from Shakespeare about the perils and pitfalls of power that it has provided him with an inexhaustible fund of material for his management and leadership workshops over the past two decades.</p>\n<p>\"The plays of Shakespeare are case studies for central human dilemmas,\" says the 61-year-old, who is part of Warwick Business School's Create unit.</p>\n<p>\"The plays are so rich, and so complex, that there are actual situations to examine. Acting things out is very powerful, people can physically get inside situations.\"</p>\n<p>Create uses Shakespeare's plays to guide students, and business clients, through numerous difficult business situations.</p>\n<p>Macbeth, for example, is viewed as a study into the limits of ambition, while The Tempest is seen as a metaphor for a perfect storm of workplace rivalry.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, A Midsummer Night's Dream is used to explore business transformation, and the Merchant of Venice teaches contract enforcement.</p>\n<p>Mr Ibbotson says: \"Shakespeare is such a wonderful asset and of course you're always using such powerful language -  it allows people to articulate much more subtle and complex ideas than thin business language.\"</p>\n<p>Richard Olivier, 54, is another person who uses Shakespeare's plays to teach good leadership and business practice.</p>\n<p>The son of Sir Laurence Olivier, the UK's most famous 20th Century Shakespearian actor, Mr Olivier says: \"Shakespeare is an amazing ethical teacher.</p>\n<p>\"Apart from the history plays, there is no play where the bad guy ends up in charge at the end.\"</p>\n<p>Clients of Mr Olivier's company Olivier Mythodrama have included NHS management, the Metropolitan Police and Daimler-Benz. His charges range from £5,000 for a half-day session to as much as £40,000 for a six-day intensive course.</p>\n<p>Mr Olivier adds: \"There's huge drama in leadership, and Shakespeare was probably the first playwright to portray the human drama of leadership in three-dimensional form.\"</p>\n<p>The area known as Shakespeare's England (which takes in the towns of Stratford, Royal Leamington Spa, Kenilworth and Warwick) received 9.94 million tourists in 2014, according to the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust, the charity that cares for Shakespeare heritage sites.</p>\n<p>It adds that the total value of tourism to the local economy is in the region of £635m, which supports some 11,150 jobs.</p>\n<p>Alisan Cole, from the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust, says: \"2014, the 450th anniversary of Shakespeare's birth, was our record year with 820,000 visitors, and we're expecting 2016 to be on a par with it, if not exceed it.\"</p>\n<p>In terms of attracting hungry and thirsty tourists, Hathaway Cafe is perfectly positioned in the centre of Stratford, and is just a short walk from the Royal Shakespeare Theatre.</p>\n<p>Manager and owner Rick Allen, 51, says that during the summer the warren-like Tudor-era teashop is packed with Asian customers, typically from China and Taiwan, playing £13 a head for afternoon tea (or £18 with a glass of prosecco).</p>\n<p>\"Off-peak we get around 1,000 customers per week, but it's well over 2,000 per week during the peak season of July and August,\" he says.</p>\n<p>Mr Allen adds that Birmingham Airport's new runway extension, which caters for the growing number of flights from East Asia, has been a fillip for the business.</p>\n<p>\"We're literally getting calls from people saying 'we've got a booking for 24 and we're on our way'. In August it's mayhem - good fun, but mayhem.\"</p>\n<p>Down in London former actor Declan McHugh, 55, has been taking people on Shakespeare-themed guided walks since 1999.</p>\n<p>He says his business - Shakespeare in the City Walk - has grown thanks to positive word of mouth, and good reviews on websites such as TripAdvisor.</p>\n<p>Mr McHugh adds that London is a rich seam for Shakespeare fans since the playwright spent most of his working life moving through the then murky and bohemian world of the Elizabethan city's playhouses.</p>\n<p>Charging £10 per adult, he says the Shakespeare anniversary year is shaping up as a record one for his business.</p>\n<p>\"I've been doing this for 17 years and I'm starting to reap the rewards,\" he says.</p>\n<p>While he says it's hard to give exact numbers, he normally gets between five and 10 people meeting him outside Blackfriars underground station every Friday at 11am. But that's just for the public walks.</p>\n<p>\"Then I also do regular walks privately for colleges and universities from across the globe, plus there's UK institutions and businesses. I have the Girl Guides coming next Monday, for example.</p>\n<p>\"Private walks usually are for 15-20 people but I have done the tour for 60 people before,\" he says.</p>\n<p>Mr McHugh says his fascination for Shakespeare began at 11 years old, and now he regards the Bard as pretty much \"his guardian angel\".</p>"

Unveiling a plaque, meeting flag-waving members of the public on a walkabout, being presented with a bouquet of flowers - these are things she has done thousands of times. But the crowds weren't going to let her forget that this day, her 90th birthday, was something out of the ordinary. </p>\n<p>Some had been waiting for hours - some for days - to catch a glimpse of the Queen on the day she became the nation's first-ever nonagenarian monarch. </p>\n<p>As the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh walked the short distance from Windsor Castle, a spontaneous rendition of Happy Birthday rang out - and it wouldn't be the last. </p>\n<p>One woman who has lived nearly as long as the Queen summed up the atmosphere. Gwen Tarr, 88, who says she is \"Windsor born and bred\", said: \"It was so lovely. I just wanted to celebrate the day with her and wish her a happy birthday - and many more birthdays to come.\"</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-36101201\" class=\"story-body__link\">Wellwishers enjoy 'special day' </a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36099082\" class=\"story-body__link\">Cameron and Corbyn lead tributes</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-36104696\" class=\"story-body__link\">In pictures: Queen's 90th birthday</a></p>\n<p>Most of the gun salutes were due to be 21 shots - the standard royal gun salute - at locations including Hillsborough Castle, Cardiff Castle, and Edinburgh Castle. </p>\n<p>In London, the King's Troop Royal Horse Artillery staged a 41-gun salute at midday in Hyde Park. And the Honourable Artillery Company fired a 62-gun salute across the Thames from the Tower of London at 13:00 BST.</p>\n<p>Prime Minister David Cameron said the Queen had been \"a rock of strength for our nation\" and the Commonwealth, as he and fellow politicians paid tribute in the House of Commons.</p>\n<p>Mr Cameron said: \"Her Majesty The Queen has lived through some extraordinary times in our world.</p>\n<p>\"From the Second World War... to the rations with which she bought the material for her wedding dress. </p>\n<p>\"From presenting the World Cup to England at Wembley in 1966, to man landing on the moon three years later.

			"title": "BBC Q&A: Police and crime commissioners",
			"date_published": 1461239246,
			"body": "\n<p class=\"story-body__introduction\">Elections for police and crime commissioners will take place across most of England and Wales on 5 May. Here is a guide to what PCCs do and how the system, introduced in 2012, works.</p>\n<p>PCCs are elected representatives who work to ensure police forces in England and Wales are running effectively. They replaced police authorities in 2012 and were intended to bring a public voice to policing. </p>\n<p>The government insists PCCs are not there to run local police forces but to hold them to account and respond to the needs of the public. </p>\n<p>There is no PCC in London because the mayor is responsible for policing.</p>\n<p>In the first PCC elections held in November 2012, 192 candidates stood for the 41 posts covering England and Wales. </p>\n<p class=\"ns_super_impact__fig\">15%</p>\n<p>turnout</p>\n<p class=\"ns_super_impact__fig\">192</p>\n<p>candidates</p>\n<p><span class=\"ns_impact__fig\">16</span> Conservatives elected </p>\n<p><span class=\"ns_impact__fig\">13</span> Labour </p>\n<p><span class=\"ns_impact__fig\">12</span> Independents </p>\n<p>Sixteen Conservative PCCs were elected, 13 from Labour and 12 Independents. Among the successful independent candidates were eight former police officers, one of Wales' most senior barristers, and an ex-pilot. Six women were elected (from 35 who stood as candidates) and 35 men.</p>\n<p>In this year's election on 5 May there are 40 votes being held - because Greater Manchester is not holding an election. The region is set to vote for the new post of elected mayor in 2017 and the powers and responsibilities of the PCC will fall to the mayor. Since last May PCC Tony Lloyd, who was elected in 2012, has held the post of interim mayor. </p>\n<p>This time there are 188 candidates standing. Labour and the Conservatives are fielding candidates in each area, with UKIP putting forward 34 candidates and the Liberal Democrats 30. Of those elected in 2012, 26 are standing again, as are two successful candidates from by-elections held in 2014.</p>\n<p>PCCs' responsibilities include: </p>\n<p>Police and crime commissioners cannot tell the police how to do their job - despite having some control over the direction of a force. The operational independence of the police is protected by legislation. </p>\n<p>New measures proposed in the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/policing-and-crime-bill\" class=\"story-body__link-external\">Policing and Crime Bill</a>, which is currently passing through Parliament, would enable PCCs to <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-34224491\" class=\"story-body__link\">take on responsibility for fire and rescue services</a>. The Home Office said it wanted to encourage more \"efficiency and effectiveness\" but the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-35138665\" class=\"story-body__link\">Fire Brigades Union called the idea \"dangerous\"</a> and a \"half-baked suggestion\" and the Local Government Association said it saw no \"pressing need\" for the change.</p>\n<p>Public elections for the first police and crime commissioners took place on 15 November 2012 in 41 police force areas across England and Wales, not including London. The elections - 37 in England and four in Wales - were described as the biggest shake-up of policing for almost 50 years but the turnout was the lowest in peacetime Britain. One polling station in Newport, Gwent, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-20355358\" class=\"story-body__link\">was visited by no voters at all</a>.</p>\n<p>Fewer than 15% of voters turned out in the 41 police areas electing a PCC, prompting the Electoral Commission to hold <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-21836934\" class=\"story-body__link\">a review into how the polls were conducted</a>. The inquiry found 80% of voters felt they did not have enough information to make an informed choice. The commission's chairwoman Jenny Watson said: \"The government took a number of decisions about how to run these elections that we did not agree with.\"</p>\n<p>All registered voters are entitled to take part in the elections. The supplementary vote system is used in all force areas where more than two candidates stand, with voters marking the ballot paper with their first and second choice of candidate. In the 2016 elections there are at least three candidates standing for each post.</p>\n<p>A PCC's term of office is four years, with a maximum of two terms.</p>\n<p>The idea of giving local people more of a say in how the police in their area are run had been championed for years by some Conservatives as a way of boosting local democracy - but it only became party policy at the 2010 general election.  </p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/sites/default/files/resources/coalition_programme_for_government.pdf\" class=\"story-body__link-external\">coalition agreement</a> published after the May 2010 election contained a pledge to make the police \"more accountable through oversight by a directly elected individual\". The proposal was fleshed out in the white paper \"<a href=\"http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/consultations/policing-21st-century/policing-21st-full-pdf?view=Binary\" class=\"story-body__link-external\">Policing in the 21st Century</a>\" and enacted in the <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2012/1129/made\" class=\"story-body__link-external\">Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act</a>, which became law in 2011.</p>\n<p>London has a directly elected mayor, who acts as the police and crime commissioner for the Metropolitan police area. London's police and crime panel is formed from a committee of elected London Assembly members. The commissioner of the Metropolitan Police continues to be a Royal appointment on the advice of the home secretary. </p>\n<p>In 2014 Chancellor George Osborne <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-29876939\" class=\"story-body__link\">announced plans for an elected mayor for Greater Manchester</a> as part of a project to hand more devolved power to the north.</p>\n<p>Manchester's PCC <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-32929721\" class=\"story-body__link\">Tony Lloyd became the city's interim mayor</a> in May 2015, retaining the PCC responsibilities when he transferred to his new role. Mancunians will vote for an elected mayor for the first time in 2017 and, as in London, the mayor will continue to oversee policing.</p>\n<p>PCCs are required to swear an oath of impartiality when they are elected to office. This echoes the commitment police officers make to serve every member of the public impartially. Before the introduction of PCCs, the government promised the way investigations were carried out would not become political.</p>\n<p>PCCs have to answer to the public - the government has said their performance \"should be judged solely by the electorate\" - and more than two-thirds of the commissioners are asking voters to re-elect them in 2016.</p>\n<p>And people can complain to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) if they think their PCC has broken the law.</p>\n<p>In addition to this, Police and Crime Panels were set up in each force area to scrutinise and challenge the actions and decisions of each PCC. A panel may require the attendance of the PCC, has the power to suspend them from office because of a criminal offence, or exercise a veto over a proposed candidate for chief constable. </p>\n<p>But in July 2013, less than a year into the new system, the Home Affairs Select Committee <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-23387324\" class=\"story-body__link\">said it seemed \"very easy\" for a PCC to remove a chief constable for \"insubstantial\" reasons</a> and advised police and crime panels should be more vigorous in analysing contentious decisions by PCCs, such as the sacking of a chief constable.</p>\n<p>In England, panels are mainly made up of representatives from each local authority in a police force area. In Wales, they are free-standing public bodies, set up and maintained by the secretary of state, rather than local authority committees.</p>\n<p>When the role was introduced, ministers insisted the cost of PCCs and police and crime panels must be no greater than the abolished police authorities. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-22624096\" class=\"story-body__link\">In 2013, BBC research</a> revealed the salaries of the majority of the PCCs were between £70,000 and £85,000, although the commissioners overseeing the three major forces of Greater Manchester, West Yorkshire and West Midlands were each receiving £100,000. It was also calculated that PCCs across England and Wales had employed at least 449 people in the six months after their introduction.</p>\n<p>Salaries are recommended by the Senior Salaries Review Body, which advises on the remuneration of those in public office, and approved by the home secretary.</p>\n<p>During the first year PCCs were in office, there were four investigations carried out by the IPCC, as well as investigations by the CPS into expenses claims. And MPs on the Home Affairs Committee <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-22636857\" class=\"story-body__link\">warned ministers were failing to properly monitor the salaries</a> and standards of PCCs.</p>\n<p>In 2014, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-29220535\" class=\"story-body__link\">South Yorkshire's PCC Shaun Wright resigned</a> over the Rotherham child abuse scandal. He had faced demands to step down in the wake of a report that found at least 1,400 children were abused in the town from 1997 to 2013. Mr Wright, who had been the head of children's services in Rotherham between 2005 and 2010, eventually said he was stepping down as PCC to ensure the \"important issues\" outlined in the report could be discussed and considered \"without distraction\".</p>\n<p>Home Secretary Theresa May had called for Mr Wright to stand down and - in the few days before he did so - the controversy prompted then Deputy Prime Minister and Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg, whose party helped pass the legislation that created PCCs, to describe the role as a \"discredited experiment\" and <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-29172812\" class=\"story-body__link\">say PCCs should be abolished</a>.</p>\n<p>Just three months after being elected Lincolnshire PCC Alan Hardwick suspended his temporary chief constable Neil Rhodes over an employment dispute. But <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-lincolnshire-21964844\" class=\"story-body__link\">a judicial review into the suspension ruled in favour of Mr Rhodes</a>, with a judge calling the suspension \"irrational and perverse\", and he was reinstated. The row also saw the chairman of the crime panel stand down. Speaking at the time, Mr Hardwick, who is not standing for re-election, said he accepted the judge's decision and added: \"The rules governing PCCs don't really envisage this sort of thing, there is more guidance needed.\"</p>\n<p>Kent PCC Ann Barnes, an Independent, has been a controversial figure during her tenure and announced in March she <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-kent-35794996\" class=\"story-body__link\">would not be standing for re-election</a>. A report last year found she <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-kent-34647110\" class=\"story-body__link\">may not have been properly insured</a> when she was in a car crash and she was criticised for <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-kent-27478691\" class=\"story-body__link\">taking part in a documentary</a> and for her appointments of youth commissioners. In a <a href=\"http://kent-pcc.gov.uk/home.php?entry_id=1457787639\" class=\"story-body__link-external\">statement on her website</a> when she said she would not be standing in the 2016 election, Ms Barnes said the people of Kent had been getting a better service and added: \"I am content that I have delivered what I said I would.\"</p>\n<p>Cumbria's PCC, Richard Rhodes, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-22220707\" class=\"story-body__link\">apologised for using a chauffeur-driven ca</a>r that cost £700 of taxpayers' money for just two trips and admitted he had failed to check how much it would cost. The former head teacher paid the money back and said at the time he understood the public concern over the case. Cumbria Police arrested three people in connection with leaking the information but no charges were brought. Mr Rhodes is not standing for re-election.</p>\n<p>When he was just over six months into the role Bob Jones, the West Midlands PCC, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-birmingham-22797713\" class=\"story-body__link\">said PCCs should be scrapped</a> and replaced with something more efficient and less party political. Mr Jones <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-birmingham-28108283\" class=\"story-body__link\">died in July 2014</a> aged 59 and a by-election was held to replace him the following month.

They also feared commissioners could interfere with the running of police forces. </p>\n<p>Critics have also questioned whether PCCs have real legitimacy following the low turnout of just over 15% in the 2012 elections.</p>\n<p>Police authorities, first established in 1964 to hold chief constables to account, had oversight of the police before PCCs. They were made up of local councillors and independent, appointed members. But the coalition government concluded police authorities were \"invisible\" and needed replacing with elected commissioners and police and crime panels. </p>"

			"body": "\n<p class=\"story-body__introduction\">Australian federal MP Dennis Jensen is not the first politician to produce a racy thriller. One-time British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd has penned some breathless prose, as has the former Queensland Premier Peter Beattie. </p>\n<p>Dr Jensen, though, may be the first to lose his job, as he sees it, over a novel containing one steamy sex scene.</p>\n<p>A conservative Liberal Party backbencher, Dr Jensen is an outspoken opponent of same-sex marriage and a climate change sceptic. He boycotted the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/7241965.stm\" class=\"story-body__link\">2008 apology</a> to the Stolen Generations, and sparked outrage recently when he said taxpayers should not be funding the \"noble savage\" lifestyles of remote Aboriginal communities.</p>\n<p>His views endeared him to a group of powerbrokers from the party's evangelical Christian wing, whose support he was counting on to help him contest his Perth seat of Tangney at a federal election due later this year.</p>\n<p>However, when local Liberals met earlier this month to choose a candidate for Tangney, the MP was cast aside - by a humiliating 57 to seven votes - in favour of Ben Morton, the party's former state director. </p>\n<p>An angry Dr Jensen blamed a \"smear campaign\", allegedly mounted in collusion with The Australian, which days earlier had <a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/mp-dennis-jensen-used-official-stationery-to-spruik-his-novel/news-story/13b83249b32296ddd8027921ef11f447\" class=\"story-body__link-external\">revealed the existence of his book</a>, The Skywarriors, about an imaginary war between Australia and an Indonesian regime briefly backed by China.</p>\n<p>The newspaper reported that the 54-year-old used his parliamentary letterhead when writing to a Sydney literary agent in 2007 seeking a publishing deal. </p>\n<p>It also reproduced a scene from his book following the downing of an Australian warplane in the Indian Ocean. A fictional Indonesian dictator, Rajiv Rono, tells his mistress, Yasmine, that \"those arrogant Australians won't know what has hit them!\" He then rips off her blouse, \"completely ignoring her protests\", and enjoys \"the fruits of his victory\". </p>\n<p>The story was enthusiastically picked up by the rest of the Australian media. Then came a second article in which The Australian reported that Dr Jensen had \"recently left the family home... to live about 60km away [outside Tangney] with his new girlfriend\".</p>\n<p>\"It was a one-two shot against me,\" Dr Jensen told the BBC. </p>\n<p>\"One, he's a purveyor of smut. Two, he's abandoned his wife and kids to shack up with his new girlfriend. This was a very well organised, well co-ordinated strike, aimed with laser precision at my religious supporters, and it was quite effective in scaring them off.</p>\n<p>\"In fact, my wife left me in July 2014. She lived in the electorate home. I lived down at our holiday home. I met my current girlfriend, and we've been together subsequently, in November 2014. So none of that stuff was current.\"</p>\n<p>How does the sex scene in Dennis Jensen's The Skywarriors stack up against raunchy writing from politicians across the world? </p>\n<p>\"Flushed with the excitement of the moment, Rono felt that he just had to relieve himself. He violently pulled Yasmine's blouse buttons apart, completely ignoring her protests. Yasmine didn't believe in wearing bras; in fact, she didn't really need to\" - Dennis Jensen in The Skywarriors.</p>\n<p>\"She gently picked up his hand and guided it to their ecstasy\" - former Queensland Premier Peter Beattie in The Year of the Dangerous Ones.</p>\n<p>\"The din from the party mocked me as Karen attacked my surly worm with gusto\" - Australian Labor Party MP Graham Perrett in The Twelfth Fish.</p>\n<p>\"Suddenly the pouting sex kitten gave way to Diana the Huntress. She rolled onto him and somehow was sitting athwart his chest, her knees pinning his shoulders. 'Tell me, or I will make you do terrible things,' she hissed\" - Former US Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich in 1945.</p>\n<p>\"On that night of 12 May 1994, I needed that love Cherie gave me, selfishly. I devoured it to give me strength. I was an animal following my instinct\" - Tony Blair in his autobiography, A Journey.</p>\n<p>Dr Jensen is now suing The Australian for defamation - an action which prompted one columnist to hail him as \"that rarest of unpublished authors, who sues a publisher for publishing material, the publication of which he had previously actively sought\". </p>\n<p>In another paradoxical move last week, the MP self-published a Kindle edition of The Skywarriors, meaning that a work subject to a defamation claim is now available on Amazon for anyone with a spare A$6.51 ($5.07; £3.54).</p>\n<p>Even at that price, readers expecting a raunchy read may well feel cheated. The book contains just one sex scene: the 154-word, toe-curling encounter already reprinted by multiple news outlets. When two fighter pilots subsequently get together, we learn only of their \"voyage of gentle and passionate discovery\". </p>\n<p>And apart from mention of an Australian oil worker engrossed in Penthouse just before his rig is attacked by Indonesia off the Kimberley coast, that is it.</p>\n<p>Instead, the novel serves up page upon page of technical detail about combat aircraft and radar systems, along with characters such as Australian pilot Jenny Peters, whose athletic physique indicates she is \"unlikely to have weight problems later in life\" and whose \"shapely calves need no assistance from any stocking\".</p>\n<p>A former submarine operations researcher with the federal government's Defence Science and Technology Organisation (now Group), Dr Jensen calls The Skywarriors - which he wrote in 2002, two years before entering parliament - a techno-thriller, after the genre pioneered by Tom Clancy. </p>\n<p>The MP's father, who is a journalist and author, advised him that every book needs at least one passage of graphic sex to get published, he says. However, after completing The Skywarriors, Dr Jensen - a member of the joint standing parliamentary committee on foreign affairs, defence and trade - decided not to pursue his quest for a publisher, fearing that it might harm Australia's relations with Indonesia and China.</p>\n<p>So why self-publish it now? </p>\n<p>\"The plot is out in the public domain now, so the damage is done. And I thought I might have a shot at seeing if it would sell. Also to put the record straight and show it's not a work of erotica, as The Australian portrayed it.\"</p>\n<p>Dr Jensen, who has held the safe Liberal seat for nearly 12 years, insists the candidate selection battle was \"on a knife edge\" until the negative articles appeared. </p>\n<p>In truth, despite him winning record majorities, he has never been popular with local Liberals, who tried to dump him in 2006 and again in 2009. The first time, then Prime Minister John Howard intervened; the second, the party's state council stepped in. This time, it seems that there is no-one willing to save him. </p>\n<p>Now Dr Jensen is \"done with\" the Liberal Party, whose MPs are expected to confine themselves to \"branch stacking, fundraising and brainless conformity\", he claims. And while he is considering standing as an independent, he believes the recent publicity has probably ruined his chances.</p>\n<p>Does an alternative career as a fiction writer appeal? </p>\n<p>\"It would, but I know it's extremely difficult to make a living. For every Wilbur Smith you've got thousands that haven't made a penny or certainly not enough to support themselves.\" </p>"

			"title": "BBC How four men survived as hostages of IS",
			"date_published": 1461106854,
			"body": "\n<p class=\"story-body__introduction\">In his classic novel 1984, George Orwell writes about Room 101 - a torture chamber where you are subjected to your worst nightmare, the worst thing in the world, to break your resistance. </p>\n<p>To survive any such place of profound pain is the greatest of gifts, a triumph of the human spirit. In our time, surviving brutal captivity at the hands of so-called Islamic State in Syria must certainly count as such a triumph. </p>\n<p>When four former hostages came together this month for their first reunion since they were freed, at different times, two years ago, it was a celebration of friendship forged in the most threatening of circumstances, a remembrance of an agonising ordeal.</p>\n<p>In the BBC radio programme Held Hostage in Syria they recall months without sunlight, weeks chained together, days upon days of beatings. There was too little food, and so much longing for clean clothes, a proper toilet, and most of all, freedom.</p>\n<p>But it was also an affirmation of extraordinary resilience. They had all won what they call a \"game of survival\" which lasted about one long terrible year of torment for all of them.</p>\n<p>They played this game in their own individual ways to preserve themselves, and some semblance of human dignity. Federico Motka, an Italian aid worker, lowered his gaze and raised his guard to avoid his captors' efforts to demean him. French war correspondent Didier Francois pushed back and stared them straight in the eye. Danish photographer Daniel Rye Ottosen, an elite gymnast, did the splits to convince them he was not a spy.  French blogger Pierre Torres took beatings, but satisfaction, from ignoring their orders. </p>\n<p>And they played this game together, helping each other endure their ordeal, as IS guards of different nationalities deployed diverse tactics of physical and psychological torture to try to break them. Only one, Daniel Rye, was subjected to such brutality that he tried to take his own life - but the guards stopped him, and his fellow hostages brought him back to health. </p>\n<p>There were real games too: chess, with pieces fashioned from cheese cartons with nail clippers; draughts (checkers), with the seeds of olives and dates; a self-styled lecture series on everything from carp fishing, to sailing, and how to dive into a small pool. This is how they escaped in their mind.</p>\n<p>At one point in 2013-2014 19 men carrying a Western or a Russian passport were held hostage together in one small room. An adjacent room was a cell for five women. One by one, they have been freed for ransom or executed. Of this group of male hostages only one, British journalist John Cantlie, is left and one woman whose name has not been made public. </p>\n<p>Several journalists and aid workers, and hundreds of Syrians, have not lived to tell of their ordeal. We know of their fate from grotesque videos on social media which have brought a sickening cinematic slickness to medieval beheadings.</p>\n<p>These are the stories of four men who went to Syria to report on a punishing war, or to try to ease suffering in this humanitarian crisis of our time. They all went to help in some way. They all found themselves in a living hell.</p>\n<p>In our studio, they return to the dark, dreadful rooms they escaped two years ago. At moments they struggle to find the right words. At moments, they still can't draw them out. There's deep sorrow, but also smiles. \"When we meet,\" reflects Didier Francois, \"we can share things that we can't share with anyone else… it's important.\"</p>\n<p>What they can share with us is a compelling chronicle of our time. </p>\n<p>DIDIER: The way it happened was very fast. I crossed the border in the morning, around 10:30am, and by 11am I was caught. As soon as you crossed from Turkey into Syria, the trap was already closing in. There was one car behind us and another in front, five guys came out and it was all very professional. There was no way to escape. They took our glasses off, they took our shoes off so we couldn't run away, we were blindfolded and they took our phones away. After this, you put yourself in survival mode immediately.</p>\n<p>PIERRE: I graduated as an oceanographer, but in 2011 I was captivated with the Arab Spring. I was very interested in the city of Raqqa. It's now the self-declared capital of the Islamic State, but at that time, it was the first capital freed from the Assad regime… On the day I got caught, I was just two minutes from my friend's house, where I was staying. A car stopped to the left of me and four or five people were in it wearing ski masks. But at that time in Raqqa, that wasn't a scary sight. It was normal to see people in a car wearing ski masks in the middle of the afternoon. I just thought, \"Oh maybe they're just going to ask me what the time is.\" But then I saw the barrels of the pistols they were holding and realised it was something else. They started to punch me like hell from everywhere with the guns and the barrels of the guns. At one point I began to collapse and I saw that the top of the car was covered in blood. I then realised that the blood was coming from my head.</p>\n<p>FEDERICO: I was with David Haines [the British aid worker] in the car. We had just spent the day talking to community groups. We went to Atma camp just on the border and then we got back in the car and started driving to our safe house. I was actually on the phone with my boss at the time and didn't notice anything until there were suddenly two black cars around us. One in front and one behind. About eight fighters piled out of it and there was a lot of shouting. I just dropped my phone on to the seat next to me - which still had my boss on the other end of the line. In a blur, you just get pulled out of the car and put down on the floor. I remember there was a man on a bike just cycling past with a look on his face that just said, \"Oh crap.\" Then we were put into the boot of a car - but it didn't close properly so they took us out and put us back in again. Then we just sped off.</p>\n<p>DANIEL: The guard said to me \"Daniel, why do you have such wide shoulders? You look like a guy from the army or something.\" And I said, \"No, no, I'm not. I'm a former elite gymnast. That's why I look the way I do.\" And he replied, \"But that's why some of the other guards think that you're a spy.\" That was when I first got really scared. I tried to show him that I wasn't a spy, and that I really was a gymnast by doing the splits there and then on the mattress. And this guy was saying, \"Stop doing that. I'm supposed to interrogate you. I'm supposed to torture you.\" Then some other guys came down and they started to yell at me, shout at me and punch me. Many of the foreign fighters - the European or Western fighters that came - tended to be a bit more aggressive towards us. At some point, I remember they came in and they took me up, and I had to dance some kind of tango. That was really strange because you really felt like you were humiliated.   </p>\n<p>DIDIER: The difficult thing when you lose your freedom is that there are no rules. You are outside the rule of law. The guards are the ones who make the decisions and you've lost all your control. So the only thing you can keep for yourself is your dignity. You have to understand that they all had one objective - to keep us under their thumb. There were no nice guards or good guards - all of them were bad. But their strategies to control us as a group were different. Some resorted to extreme violence and others used more sophisticated tactics. The French guards were more into playing games with our minds, while the British were more into a direct approach - control and violence. And we never knew which method would be used. They came on a regular basis to beat you up with no reason, to show you that they are in charge. They put some pepper spray on my blindfold. There was no water and no food for four days. </p>\n<p>PIERRE: I had a massive guilt complex at one stage and it was bothering me all the time. I actually felt like I had accepted some things too easily and I wanted to be able to fight and struggle. So at one stage, I targeted a very young guard - I think he was from Tunisia. I stood in front of him and made direct eye contact. Those guards were so sensitive to body language and eye contact. So I stood in front of him very proud, and with my eyes I was saying, \"You're a piece of shit.\"… Then at one stage, that guard wanted to punch me. He came up to me holding a stick, and he tried to take me down with it, but I stood up. A few minutes later, he came back and he was so angry. He was really out of control. He took me away from the jail where I was and beat the crap out of me with the stick. Then he took me back to the cell with the others, and I was suffering a lot all over my body. He'd also punched me in the stomach so I had shit on my pants. But I was euphoric. It was like taking cocaine or something. I was feeling so great. I loved that moment and really appreciated it. It was worth it. </p>\n<p>DANIEL: I tried to focus on all the bright things in my situation. I started counting a lot, talking to myself, and started making up projects in my head. I think the survival mode that you go into when you're by yourself is very interesting. It's really, really difficult. You're just there with your brain, and yourself.  I could have good times when I thought everything seemed fine, and I could have bad times. When I look back now, I had different states of mind. I had the shock at the beginning. The second part was about accepting and adapting. The third part was thinking that this was my everyday life. This is when you become a good hostage. And for me, this is actually when the time started to go by faster. There was a point when I thought, \"I will not survive.\" I tried to escape and I tried to hang myself and I was rescued by the bad guys. They came in and they took me down and everything was OK, and I really felt that they would not kill me. But my point is that I went through that and suddenly I came to a new sense of self where the situation was completely different. </p>\n<p>FEDERICO: We were split up, me and Dave [David Haines]. Dave had given me three pieces of advice which I will never forget: always tell the truth; if we get split up make a routine; and play the game. They took me out and drove me off to another place, just a completely black cell with a toilet, and for about three weeks - nothing. Days and days of solitude. I would pace up and down and do these things like chatting to my parents and my sister in my head and try to sleep again. Anything to pass the days. We only really became a group with the other hostages much later on, at the end of July. Our only ability to keep dignity was to try to keep as clean as you could. But we were going through a routine of having our hands cuffed behind our back at night and our hands cuffed in front during the day. On some occasions when they told us that we smelt too bad, the handcuffs would be taken off so we could take our T-shirts off and wash our armpits with a little bit of water. That was for me the way to maintain dignity… I'd been wearing the same clothes that I'd had on that afternoon that we got caught up right until July - even longer than that actually. I just took every opportunity whenever I went to the toilet to wash them in water. It was my obsession.</p>\n<p>DIDIER: This cloth is a cotton scarf in which I had hidden some chess pieces, made from Vache Qui Rit cheese boxes. We played chess a lot.</p>\n<p>PIERRE: We organised lectures, we organised sport and we organised games. </p>\n<p>FEDERICO: We used blankets to make a boat on the ground and I then tried to explain with my very limited physics how sails work and boats go faster. Alan Henning gave a lecture on carp fishing I think. </p>\n<p>[Pierre gave a lecture on how to make iron. Daniel gave a lecture on diving from a high board into a small pool.]</p>\n<p>DANIEL: I remember my brain was thirsty. It wanted any information no matter what it was, as long as it was somebody talking about something from the real world.</p>\n<p>FEDERICO: There was another game that we did that was really great - we did versions of Werewolf, also called Mafia. Whoever was narrating created the plot and then handed out characters and then people had to behave in that way. We had prima donnas and a prostitute at one point. </p>\n<p>DIDIER: We were obsessed with food - that was a long part of every discussion. Every night we tried to imagine a menu with the \"non-dessert of the day\". So it was the non-menu and a non-dessert that we would never get. When I got out, the first meal given to me was from the French intelligence team who were part of the army. It was when I was on the military plane, they opened the cans of cassoulet with beers. That was great. </p>\n<p>DANIEL: I think the whole time the hostages and I were sitting inside together, we shared the same dream of crossing the border together. That wherever we were, we would go to a hotel together and there would be a buffet. We spoke a lot about that buffet, and how 19 guys would sit around the table and share it together. A day that should be a very happy day; crossing the border, going into freedom and going back to our families. And there was still some part of me staying behind in Syria saying, \"It's only the end when all of us can sit around this table and eat our buffet.\"</p>\n<p>DIDIER: I think among all the hostages, we still have a strong bond. You can't live what we went through without keeping something. Even the bad parts of it. When we meet we share things that you cannot share with anyone else. It's very important.</p>\n<p>PIERRE: Some of us were coming out of really tough experiences, we all had difficulties and we were all such different characters, but we really teamed up with each other. We built up something very strong between us.</p>\n<p>FEDERICO: I had received a proof-of-life question - the colour of the bedroom wall in my mum's house is orange. It was one of the most bittersweet moments of my life. Up until then I had to believe that David [Haines] and I would be released together and that was the moment that I realised it wasn't happening and I cried like a baby. Dave was sitting next to me and he hugged me and everyone was really nice. They said, \"Take this chance.\" David knew by then that things weren't looking great. My proof of life meant his loss of a certain level of hope.</p>\n<p>[David Haines was beheaded in September 2014, four months after Federico was released.]</p>\n<p>DANIEL: When I was released, we were eight guys left - me and a German guy, and three Brits and three Americans. I got my proof of life, then the German guy got his proof of life a few days later. At that point it was very clear that they were not negotiating for the Americans and the Brits. The day that I was released, I was sitting in a corner and I was crying, early in the morning, all by myself just with a blanket over my head not to show the other guys that I was nervous. And then James [Foley] came over to me, put his arm over my shoulders and said, \"Don't worry, they will probably come in 10 or 15 minutes, and you will be on your way home, and just enjoy it. You really earned your freedom.\"</p>\n<p><i>Subscribe to the </i><a href=\"https://ssl.bbc.co.uk/newsletters/newsmagazine?ptrt=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine\" class=\"story-body__link\">BBC News Magazine's email newsletter</a><i> to get articles sent to your inbox.</i></p>"

			"body": "\n<p class=\"story-body__introduction\">Volkswagen will offer \"substantial compensation\" and car buy-back deals in the US as part of a settlement of the the diesel emissions scandal.</p>\n<p>Final details of the packages offered will be announced in June, but a court had given VW and regulators until Thursday to reach a deal in principle.</p>\n<p>Last year, US regulators discovered that VW cars were fitted with software that could distort emissions tests.</p>\n<p>The German giant subsequently said 11 million cars worldwide were affected.</p>\n<p>Details of the preliminary agreement were announced in a California court. US district court Judge Charles Breyer said the settlement would include a buyback offer for nearly 500,000 2.0-litre vehicles. </p>\n<p>He did not give details of how much car owners would offered in compensation, but said the deal between Volkswagen, the US government and private lawyers would be \"substantial\". </p>\n<p>Judge Breyer said VW would also pay into an environmental fund and commit other money to promote green car technology.</p>\n<p>Volkswagen told its shareholders last year it had set aside $7.3bn to help defray the potential costs of a recall or regulatory penalties, but that figure could rise.

Some models could have been pumping out up to 40 times the legal limit of the pollutant, nitrogen oxide, regulators disclosed.</p>\n<p>\"Volkswagen is committed to winning back the trust of its customers, its dealers, its regulators and all of America,\" said VW lawyer Robert Giuffra. The agreements are \"an important step forward on the road to making things right,\" he added.</p>\n<p>The firm said in a statement that it \"intends to compensate its customers fully and to remediate any impact on the environment from excess diesel emissions\".</p>\n<p>It said a deal in principle had been reached with the Justice Department, the Environmental Protection Agency and the California Air Resources Board.</p>\n<p>It added that it had \"reached an agreement on the basic features of a settlement with the class action plaintiffs in the lawsuit in San Francisco. This agreement will be incorporated into a comprehensive settlement in the coming weeks\".</p>\n<p>The deal announced on Thursday covers mostly 2-litre vehicles. Judge Breyer said he expects an agreement between VW and regulators covering about 90,000 larger vehicles and SUVs to be addressed \"expeditiously\".</p>"

			"body": "\n<p class=\"story-body__introduction\">As she celebrates her 90th birthday, the image of the Queen on stage and screen is more prevalent than ever. But what is it like to play one of the most famous faces in the world - and what makes so many want to do so? </p>\n<p>Playing the Queen could be daunting for many actresses. But two who have done exactly that on stage say there is one crucial element for getting into character - the wig.</p>\n<p>Emma Handy played Liz - the 1980s version of the Queen - in the recent touring production of Moira Buffini play Handbagged, which imagines older and younger versions of the Queen and Margaret Thatcher in conversation during their weekly audience. </p>\n<p>\"The wig and make-up and clothes do so much,\" she says. \"It's extraordinary.\" </p>\n<p>But, adds Handy: \"She seems to have two faces - the public and the private face. There is very little footage of her private life, but she is known to be enormously mischievous - and these are things I have in common with her.\"   </p>\n<p>One thing Handy was adamant about was not doing an impersonation of the Queen - instead she focused on capturing her \"essence\". She says she found sitting \"incredibly straight-backed\" helped. </p>\n<p>\"She's probably the most photographed person in the world, so everyone has an idea of her,\" says Handy. </p>\n<p>\"Every year you see the Christmas broadcast, but that's not who she is. There is a massive side of her people don't know.\"</p>\n<p>Marion Bailey, who played Q - the older Queen - in the West End production, says: \"It is irresistible to play the Queen. When I was cast, I mentioned it to a few people and someone said I didn't look anything like the Queen. </p>\n<p>\"And I replied: 'Oh, but I do,'\". I've often sat in make-up chairs and had my hair in a particular way, looked in the mirror and thought: 'You know what? I could do the Queen,'.\"</p>\n<p>In preparation for the London run of the play, initially at the Tricycle Theatre before transferring to the Vaudeville Theatre, she says she watched all the Queen's Christmas messages - as well as anything else she could find online. </p>\n<p>And the reaction was everything she could have hoped for. </p>\n<p>\"Some nights I would walk out and there would be gasps,\" she says. \"It was to do with the look of it and the history, and I tried to get as many of the mannerisms as I could. On the West End transfer, I heard an American tourist whisper: 'Is that the Queen?'.\"  </p>\n<p>Prof Philip Murphy, director of the Institute of Commonwealth Studies at the University of London, says the closest the public ever got to seeing the real Queen was in the 1969 documentary Royal Family.</p>\n<p>But Prof Murphy says: \"The Royal Family effectively suppressed it. They decided it reduced the mystique around them. </p>\n<p>\"In a way, that creates a carte blanche for writers and satirists to make up personalities.\"</p>\n<p>He adds: \"That's the problem the Royal Family has - they want to appear human but they also want to appear somehow removed and keep this dignified distance.\"</p>\n<p>One issue with writing about the Queen is that \"fact and fiction gets mixed up\", he says. </p>\n<p>\"The public have very little sense of what actually goes on. But a plausible fictional representation can almost seep into historical record.\"</p>\n<p>Portrayals of the Queen have not always been the most flattering, he notes.</p>\n<p>\"Spitting Image was an attack on British deference around authority figures - and there were no more esteemed than the Royal Family,\" says the professor.  </p>\n<p>One of the lead writers of that series was author John O'Farrell, who says: \"If you cast your mind back to the 1980s, there was an enormous reverential style. It was seen as poor form to laugh at the Queen's expense... But what we did was show her to be an ordinary person in an ordinary family, which is where it struck a comic nerve,\" he says.</p>\n<p>He adds: \"The tabloids faked outrage, but people loved it... At times it was crude and disrespectful - but I think that's warranted.\"</p>\n<p>Alison Jackson is someone else whose work has attracted controversy. Her apparently candid photographs of celebrities in private moments are created with the help of carefully-chosen lookalikes. </p>\n<p>Thanks to Jackson, we see \"the Queen\" putting out dog food for her corgis, taking a selfie and doing the washing-up. </p>\n<p>\"I thought it would be really good to get her doing normal things,\" says Jackson. </p>\n<p>\"She is a person, after all. And she does do normal things - she reads, she drives a Land Rover, she gets her hands dirty - she's quite tomboyish, really. She's not a diva and seems to come across as a normal woman, even though of course she's not.\"</p>\n<p>Jackson says one photograph seems to be seen as going too far, however. </p>\n<p>\"My photograph of the Queen on the loo is my least published. I don't think it's been seen in any newspaper in England, whereas a lot of other works get published all the time,\" she says.</p>\n<p>\"People think breaking that taboo is tasteless, which I find interesting. But it's designed to be thought-provoking, rather than controversial.\"</p>\n<p>Thought provoking as they may be, perhaps fictional representations get us no closer to who the Queen actually is - barring of course the only time she has played herself, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/xW5abat5NEU\" class=\"story-body__link-external\">acting alongside Daniel Craig in a James Bond sketch</a> for the London Olympics opening ceremony in 2012. </p>\n<p>But that certainly isn't going to stop people from continuing to try to capture the essence of this elusive, yet ever-present, figure. </p>"

A large number of aftershocks followed, including one that measured 7.3 on 12 May 2015. Photographer Alison Baskerville travelled to Nepal with Handicap International UK to meet young people whose lives were changed forever by those events.</strong></p>\n<p>Uma Silwal (right) was at home with her family when the earthquake hit.  </p>\n<p>\"We were sitting having lunch and the ground started to shake,\" she says. \"At first we just froze, we had no idea what to do. Then we ran. I don't remember the wall landing on me. I just remember seeing everyone running ahead in front of me.\"  </p>\n<p>At the time of the earthquake Uma was studying engineering. Her father had just retired from a long career in the Nepalese Fire Service and was adjusting to life at home with a reduced income. </p>\n<p>\"I knew I had to get educated and find work so I could help support my family,\" Uma says.  </p>\n<p>The earthquake destroyed their home. As well as looking after her family, Uma's mother has been involved in rebuilding their house, and feeding the workers. </p>\n<p>\"My mother does so much,\" says Uma. \"Sometimes I worry that we take her for granted. She is the closest person to me and keeps our family together.\"  </p>\n<p>Uma later decided to change her degree to social work. \"I had a few choices ahead of me before the earthquake. It felt like with two legs I have two paths to take.  </p>\n<p>\"After the quake I only have one leg but it's also given me one clear path. To help those who are like me.\"</p>\n<p>Amrit Magar was sleeping in his room in the Pepsicola district of Kathmandu when the earthquake hit.  </p>\n<p>With both parents at work he was home alone and unsure what to do. He tried to run from the house but as he escaped the building collapsed and he was buried in rubble. </p>\n<p>Neighbours managed to pulled him free and he was taken to hospital.  </p>\n<p>\"When the wall fell I was unconscious. When I woke up I thought my legs were fine,\" he says. </p>\n<p>But Amrit remained in a fracture ward until the decision was made to remove one of his legs because it was so badly damaged.   </p>\n<p>\"I loved football before my accident but now I like to read and I want to go back to school,\" says Amrit. </p>\n<p>His father says they can no longer keep Amrit at home as they cannot afford the taxi fares for him to go to the local clinic.  </p>\n<p>Amrit's brother Amish (middle) spent four weeks by his side in hospital.</p>\n<p>His mother, Chandra Kala Magar, holds a family photograph that was recovered from the home. They now live in a temporary home built by the family's employer. </p>\n<p>Ramesh Khatri, then 18, was trapped under rubble for almost three days. When he was eventually pulled free he was rushed to the already overcrowded Bir hospital in Kathmandu. He kept his badly damaged legs for almost five days before doctors decided they should both be amputated.  </p>\n<p>\"I just had to accept this new life I have been given without my legs. It has not been easy but I'm really trying to start again and adapt to my new life,\" he says.</p>\n<p>Ramesh uses the walkway at the National Disability Fund clinic in Kathmandu to train on his prosthetics.  </p>\n<p>Although he has become highly skilled in his wheelchair, he is now focusing on his walking.  </p>\n<p>A few days after breaking his third wheelchair, Ramesh decided to take part in a 3km race in the city. </p>\n<p>With bloodied hands and sweat on his brow, Ramesh pushed himself to sixth place out of 21. \"Next year I'm going to win this race,\" he shouted as he received his finishing medal.</p>\n<p>\"He is ever the optimist,\" says Samrat Singh Basnet, the owner of the hostel where Ramesh lives. \"He's always there in the clinic, helping and encouraging people.\"</p>\n<p>\"I want to study first and then I want to be a social worker to help other people like me,\" says Ramesh. \"Whatever happened, happened. This is our future. We should start from here. We can start again even with our disability.\"</p>\n<p>Sandesh was on his lunch break at the Nepal Police School when the earth began to shake. Along with his classmates he fled from the room where they were.   </p>\n<p>But the outside wall collapsed on top of him, pinning him to the ground.  </p>\n<p>\"We were going to hide under the beds but then we decided to run,\" says Sandesh. \"Then the wall fell down on me. I was unconscious until I got to hospital.\"</p>\n<p>He too lost his legs because of the injuries he sustained. In hospital, he also received the terrible news that his best friend had been killed. </p>\n<p>After almost nine months at home Sandesh has now returned to the police school.  </p>\n<p>He is the only student with a disability and the school have tried their best to accommodate him. But there is a steep slope between the classrooms and accommodation blocks, which makes it difficult for Sandesh to move between the two areas. He stays in the classroom area throughout the school day. </p>\n<p>During his time in hospital he says he lost motivation and found it difficult to accept his condition. With help from therapists and fellow patient Ramesh, he was able to come to terms with his disability. </p>\n<p>He began using a wheelchair, later also using crutches, until he received his prosthetic legs. \"I thought I would never walk again,\" he says. \"When I stood up for the first time I was so happy.\"</p>\n<p class=\"story-body__introduction\">All photographs © Alison Baskerville / Handicap International</p>"

We will be investing on a commercial basis. We would not see this as nationalisation. We would not be seeking to acquire a control in the business. We don't think that nationalisation is the right answer.\"</p>\n<p>The steel industry welcomed the financial support package as \"a positive first step\".</p>\n<p>Gareth Stace, director of UK Steel, said: \"We have been calling for government to step up to the mark and provide this type of financial commitment and backing. </p>\n<p>\"We are not yet out of the woods however. Further action is still needed on energy costs and business rates whilst at EU level, we still need to see tougher action on the dumping of cheap imports.

			"title": "BBC What's the difference between a stalker and a super-fan?",
			"date_published": 1461194914,
			"body": "\n<p class=\"story-body__introduction\">Singer Lily Allen has spoken out about her experience of being stalked by a stranger and her treatment by the police. It's not the first time a celebrity has received obsessive attention, but what are the stages that lead to somebody becoming a dangerous stalker?</p>\n<p>Lily Allen was relaxing in her flat last year when a stalker broke in and confronted her in her bedroom.</p>\n<p>\"I'm lying in bed and I can see the door handle moving and then he steams in, starts screaming and shouting... I could see he was really agitated and upset,\" she told the BBC's Newsnight.</p>\n<p>Alex Gray, from Perth, was charged and found guilty of harassment and burglary and is awaiting sentencing.  It was the culmination of an ordeal that started back in 2008 when Gray first contacted Allen on Twitter. Over time he began turning up at her house and office, left abusive notes and made suicide threats.</p>\n<p>Lily Allen is one of a long list of celebrities who have received persistent unwanted attention including singer Joss Stone and Little Mix's Jade Thirlwall. </p>\n<p>Television presenter and journalist Alexis Bowater has been stalked three separate times.</p>\n<p>\"It's extraordinarily psychologically damaging and traps you in an unwanted relationship with somebody that quite often you've never met and never want to meet. You're locked in a relationship with this perpetrator who's trying to control your life.\"</p>\n<p>But Alexis says super-fans and celebrity stalkers have little in common. While they may both have an intense interest in a particular celebrity, this is where the similarity ends.</p>\n<p>\"Stalkers frighten people and fans don't. There is a massive difference between meeting somebody and thinking 'she's quite nice and I'll send her some flowers' and approaching someone persistently doing that and making threats, pursuing and harassing them.\"</p>\n<p>Frank Farnham, consultant forensic psychiatrist at Barnet Enfield and Haringey Mental Health NHS Trust, agrees.</p>\n<p>\"Super-fans are relatively stable. They gain a lot from being in a group of people who like the same person. It's a pro-social behaviour. The super-fans know each other, they go to the same gigs together, they meet up and go for a drink,\" he says.</p>\n<p>\"With stalking, it's an anti-social behaviour. They think they have this special bond and this relationship with the celebrity and none of the other fans matter. When you're breaking into someone's bedroom, that's not the actions of a super-fan.\" </p>\n<p>It's a fundamentally different thing to start harassing people, says Dr Emma Short from Bedfordshire University. \"People with mental health problems who are vulnerable to delusions are the more likely to become stalkers,\" she says.</p>\n<p>\"The fixated celebrity stalker sees everything the celeb does in relationship to themselves. Everything has meaning. So if they are served with a cease and desist letter, they may think the celebrity is trying to contact them in code. </p>\n<p>\"The court process is complicated - for stalkers being in the same room as the celebrity can reinforce their feeling of attachment. Lily Allen spoke on Newsnight about how her stalker locked eyes with her. Being in the same room as her was very important to him.\"</p>\n<p>Celebrity stalkers get a huge amount of press, however they make up just a small part of those committing the criminal activity. Research from the Suzy Lamplugh Trust (which runs the National Stalking Helpline) has found one in five British women and one in 12 British men are victims of stalking during their lifetimes.</p>\n<p>Most celebrities don't know their stalkers, however in 90% of cases victims do know the person harassing them.</p>\n<p>Statistics from the National Stalking Helpline have revealed that 22% of stalkers are acquaintances of the victim, 5% worked or once worked with them, and 4% are family members. The largest group by far is ex-partners, who make up 45% of the total.</p>\n<p>Zoe Dronfield was stalked by a former partner who later attacked her. The mother-of-two from Coventry was left hospitalised with a bleed on her brain and a neck wound following an eight-hour attack. </p>\n<p>Zoe said she received calls, messages and emails and was harassed on social media after they broke up.</p>\n<p>\"There is a serious lack of understanding of stalking and the insidious behaviour behind it because certain incidents in isolation aren't frightening but when it gets to double figures and on a daily basis and you aren't able to function it's really frightening. You think 'what have I done to deserve this'?\"</p>\n<p>As classified by <a href=\"https://www.stalkingriskprofile.com/what-is-stalking/types-of-stalking\" class=\"story-body__link-external\">Australian academics</a> Paul Mullen, Michele Pathe and Rosemary Purcell.</p>\n<p>1: <strong>Rejected stalkers</strong> tend to be former sexual partners, who want to either reconcile or get revenge. They stalk because it allows the stalker to continue to feel close to the victim or allows them to salvage some self-esteem.</p>\n<p>2: <strong>Intimacy seeking stalkers</strong> suffer from loneliness and a lack of a confidante. Victims are usually strangers or acquaintances and the stalkers behaviour is often driven by mental health problems such as delusions. Celebrity stalkers often fall in to this category.</p>\n<p>3: <strong>Resentful stalkers</strong> feel they have been somehow mistreated by the victim and can arise from mental illness where the stalker develops paranoia. </p>\n<p>4: <strong>Predatory stalkers</strong> have deviant sexual interests. Stalking often starts as voyeurism for sexual gratification but can lead to sexual assault. </p>\n<p>5: <strong>Incompetent suitors</strong> want short-term sexual relationships. They usually stalk strangers or acquaintances for short periods. If they do persist they may be blind to the distress this causes and may have conditions that affect their social skills.</p>\n<p>Stalking is \"repeated, unwanted contact that occurs as a result of fixation or obsession and causes the victim(s) to feel distressed and fearful,\" according to the Suzy Lamplugh Trust.</p>\n<p>While the triggers for stalking can vary, the behaviour displayed follows a broadly similar pattern.</p>\n<p>\"It is common for stalking to escalate and get gradually worse over time. Stalkers are by nature obsessive and the longer they do it the more entrenched their fixation becomes,\" says Kristiana Rixon, from the trust.</p>\n<p>\"Stalking doesn't just affect the victim. A stalker typically contacts 21 people known to the victim including friends, family and neighbours. It's important that they don't engage with the stalker either as 5% of stalkers will assault someone known to the victim. Research shows 30 to 40% of victims are also physically assaulted.\"</p>\n<p>You should contact the police if you're being stalked - you have a right to feel safe in your home and workplace. Call 999 if you or someone else is in immediate danger otherwise contact your local police. </p>\n<p>Victims, whether they are celebrities or otherwise, experience a constant sense of dread and anxiety. </p>\n<p>\"I experienced what any other stalking victim would, which is hyper-vigilance,\" Alexis Bowater says.</p>\n<p>\"You know that an attack is imminent and inevitable but you just don't know where or when or who by.  You slowly change all of your behaviours, not all at once. Everything that you do is to make sure you and your family are safe. You spend your whole time expecting to be attacked at any moment.\"</p>\n<p>According to the Suzy Lamplugh Trust 80% of victims of stalking are women. Although women in their early 20s are slightly more likely to be stalked, age isn't a barrier. </p>\n<p>\"We've had cases from women in their 70s to women under the age of 18,\" says Rixon.</p>\n<p>Her advice on how to deal with stalkers is straightforward. </p>\n<p>\"If you are receiving unwanted attention tell them once. If they don't stop you shouldn't respond to them again as they will take this as an acknowledgement. I know this can be hard. You should also keep a record. You can also contact the National Stalking Helpline for advice and you can go to the police and make a report.\"</p>\n<p>The trust has argued that the police need to do more to support stalking victims. They have pointed to research that found only 26.6% of cases had been reported to the police and of those who made a report, 43% had not found the response helpful. </p>\n<p>Police action on stalking differs around the country. While Alexis says the police took her case \"very seriously\", Zoe said she was met with an unsympathetic response.  </p>\n<p>\"My experience of the police was when they first came round was 'you need to find yourself a nice boyfriend in future.' That's really not the attitude to be taking and it's quite an insult to your intelligence. It's exasperating. I felt helpless which is why I felt I had to manage the situation myself.\" </p>\n<p><i>Additional reporting by Jon Kelly</i></p>\n<p>What's it like to be stalked for a decade?

			"title": "BBC How the French learned to love their police",
			"date_published": 1461194904,
			"body": "\n<p class=\"story-body__introduction\">A record number of people have applied to join the French police force over the past year. Many new recruits say the recent attacks in Paris inspired them to sign up. It also seems that the shootings have made the country rethink its attitude towards the police.</p>\n<p>A young recruit pushes away a woman charging at her with a club. The recruit draws her revolver. \"Police! Don't move!\" she yells. </p>\n<p>Audrey is taking part in a self-defence class at the police training school in Sens, eastern France, having signed up after gunmen attacked the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo and a Jewish supermarket at the start of 2015.  </p>\n<p>\"Since the [Paris] terror attacks in January and November last year, the danger confronting us is clear,\" she says. \"Any one of us can be a victim. Every one of us needs protection. And we all want to help somehow. That's why I'm here. To help make this country safer.\" </p>\n<p>In March this year, a record 35,000 people sat the exam to join the police - 50% more than last year. </p>\n<p>Only 8% of those who took the test passed - the same success level as for the entrance exam for the elite Science-Po political science school in Paris.  </p>\n<p>\"I was really shocked by the video from the Charlie Hebdo killings of the policeman who was on the ground, asking for mercy, who they shot in cold blood,\" says another recruit, Perez, when I ask him why he joined the police.  </p>\n<p>\"That made me want to defend our republic, defend our nation even more. In the morning we'll wake up and know that maybe today we'll risk our lives but we're more motivated than ever,\" he says.  </p>\n<p>The policeman Perez is talking about was called Ahmed Merabet, and the next recruit I talk to shares the same first name. </p>\n<p>\"I'm of Algerian origin,\" he says. \"We had a lot of terrorism in Algeria when I was growing up. I remember the curfews when we went there on holiday. When the Bataclan happened in November I remembered Algeria, and in December I joined the police.\"</p>\n<p>Three of the victims in the Charlie Hebdo and kosher supermarket attacks were police officers, and the live TV coverage of their colleagues storming the shop to save hostages led many to see them as heroes.  </p>\n<p>Then, in November, the first man to confront the attackers inside the Bataclan concert hall in Paris was an off-duty police officer who happened to be passing. He entered the building and shot one of the gunmen dead with his service revolver. A few days later police stormed a flat in St Denis, just north of the city, killing the suspected ringleader. </p>\n<p>\"The terror attacks are a decisive factor for many in our new intake,\" says the director of the training college, Jacques Richard.</p>\n<p>\"I think these young people are discovering a sense of duty and the desire to help their fellow human beings.</p>\n<p>\"When something like this happens, people pull together. Everyone wants to make their own contribution. There's been a big increase in the number of people volunteering to give blood, for example. And more people have wanted to join the emergency services and the police. It's had a big influence on the way people think.\" </p>\n<p>The image of the police in France has changed significantly over the past 20 years. The 1995 film <i>La Haine</i>, a hit both at the box-office and with the critics, portrayed the police as sadistic and racist. </p>\n<p>\"It's an anti-police film,\" explained Mathieu Kassovitz, who won the best director prize for the movie at Cannes that year. When the cast climbed the famous festival steps, the police on duty there turned their backs in protest.</p>\n<p>The police have had an extremely negative image in France for centuries, says historian Jean-Marc Berliere, who's written several books about them.  </p>\n<p>\"Even in Louis XIV's time the people loathed the police,\" he says. \"In the public imagination the police meant repression and the limitation of freedom.\" </p>\n<p>A defining moment was May 1968 when police and rioting students fought pitched battles around Paris's Sorbonne University. That revolutionary movement spread to workers bringing the French economy to a virtual standstill for two weeks. Violence erupted when President Charles de Gaulle tried to sort things out by sending in the police. </p>\n<p>But the media always had a soft-spot for the paving-stone-hurling students.  </p>\n<p>But four days after the Charlie Hebdo massacre, something extraordinary happened. People filled the streets of Paris to show their sympathy for the the victims and demonstrate their support for the police. A <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duCIpdE-Q6I&amp;list=RDduCIpdE-Q6I\" class=\"story-body__link-external\">video posted on YouTube</a> captures the moment. </p>\n<p>The crowd parts. There are women running - some of them laughing. \"What's going on?\" says the man filming with his smartphone. And then, police - in vans and on foot. Their black rubber shoulder protection giving them the kind of silhouettes usually associated with science fiction heroes. And the crowd starts to chant, \"<i>Merci, merci</i>\" - Thank you, thank you.</p>\n<p>\"I couldn't believe it,\" says Jean-Marc Berliere who was there. \"Here was a young, urban, intellectual crowd applauding the police! I saw women giving them flowers. I saw people shaking their hands. I saw women kissing them. And you could see how moved the police were. It was so unexpected.\"</p>\n<p>For Audrey, it made her realise that \"this job is, in fact, fantastic\".</p>\n<p>Something like this had happened only once before, says Berliere, at the liberation of Paris in August 1944. The police were the first to rise up against the Germans before the Allies got there. \"Afterwards, when they marched, the crowds shouted '<i>Vive les flics!</i>' - Long live the cops!\" he says.</p>\n<p>It's not clear if the police's popularity will last, or if it will sag like a souffle in a police canteen. </p>\n<p>A video of a police officer hitting a young black demonstrator at a recent demonstration against labour reforms has not helped their image. Neither has a book by renowned anthropologist Didier Fassin, La Force de l'Ordre (Security Forces). He was allowed to follow the police in one part of the Paris region from 2005 to 2007 and reports widespread brutality and racism. </p>\n<p>But, for the time being at least, a significant part of the French population is seeing the police in a new way. As heroes.</p>\n<p><i>Subscribe to the </i><a href=\"https://ssl.bbc.co.uk/newsletters/newsmagazine?ptrt=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine\" class=\"story-body__link\">BBC News Magazine's email newsletter</a><i> to get articles sent to your inbox.</i></p>"

			"date_published": 1461194448,
			"body": "\n<p class=\"story-body__introduction\">In St Clair County, Illinois, the local prosecutor is trying a radical new experiment: admitting his office has charged innocent people with crimes and clearing their names before they spend a day in prison. It's a unique reform effort as prosecutors around the country face increased scrutiny and diminishing public trust.</p>\n<p>Lashonda Moreland's day had barely begun when the pounding on the front door began. Her husband had already left for work, and she was home with her two children in their second storey apartment in a suburb of St Louis, Missouri. </p>\n<p>When a voice barked through the door, Moreland realised the figures outside were police officers. </p>\n<p>\"He said, 'You need to open up the door or we're going to kick it down,'\" she recalls. \"My kids are scared and they're crying...I'm upset and I start crying.\"</p>\n<p>The police arrested Moreland - a 30-year-old home healthcare worker with no criminal history - and she spent the next several days in various jails until she was transferred over the river to St Clair County, Illinois.</p>\n<p>\"It was scary because I had never been in jail. I never had to be on lockdown,\" she says. \"I literally cried every day. I was trying to wrap my mind around, 'Why am I in here?'\"</p>\n<p>Moreland was accused of shoplifting, evading police and for trying to run down a police officer with her car. </p>\n<p>Several months prior to her arrest, a young couple walked into an Old Navy store in a strip mall in Fairview Heights, Illinois. They shoveled little girls' coats, jeans and pants into bags, some still attached to their hangers, then walked out and got into a maroon Buick LeSabre with nearly $700 (£495) worth of stolen merchandise. A security guard called the police.</p>\n<p>The responding officers from the Fairview Heights Police Department quickly located the car at a traffic signal, and an officer named Drew Rutter got out of his patrol vehicle and approached the driver's side of the Buick on foot.</p>\n<p>\"The driver and I made eye contact, and I observed her grasp the steering wheel,\" Rutter later wrote in his report. \"Fearing for my life and the safety of others in the area, I immediately drew my department issued duty weapon.\"</p>\n<p>The car lurched past him and another officer, missing Rutter's legs by \"inches\", and disappeared down the highway.</p>\n<p>All the police had was the licence plate number, which was registered to Lashonda Moreland's address. When Officer Rutter looked at Moreland's driver's licence photo, he immediately identified her as the woman who had tried to run him over. </p>\n<p>Moreland didn't own a Buick, nor did she do her shopping 30 minutes away in a completely different state. She did, however, have a cousin who had registered his maroon Buick LeSabre to her address without telling her. She explained all this to the Fairview Heights police when they first contacted her after the incident, but they didn't believe her.</p>\n<p>Things looked bad for Moreland. She couldn't prove her alibi and the witness who placed her at the scene was an officer of the law. She was facing up to 11 years in prison. </p>\n<p>Instead of getting dragged through a jury trial, something surprising happened. Moreland's lawyer Kristi Flint told the St Clair County state's attorney office that her client was innocent. In response, the prosecutor offered Moreland the chance to take a polygraph test. Flint nervously agreed, and Moreland passed. Six months after her arrest, the charges were dropped. Everyone, including the Fairview Heights police department, agrees that Moreland is innocent. </p>\n<p>Moreland did not know it at the time, but she was the beneficiary of a new programme created by St Clair County State's Attorney Brendan Kelly: the Actual Innocence Claim Policy and Protocol. It is a unique, pre-conviction intervention which attempts to prevent the \"actually innocent\" from going through a trial, taking a plea deal, or ending up in prison.</p>\n<p>Actual innocence is a legal concept which means, simply, that a defendant did not commit the crime of which he or she is accused. It is usually invoked when a prison inmate is attempting to appeal his sentence, but Kelly wanted to bring the spirit of the concept to the pre-conviction level. </p>\n<p>\"That's distinct from 'I didn't get treated fairly',\" says Kelly, a Navy veteran who became the county's top law enforcement officer in 2010 when he was only 34 years old. \"It's not, 'Some of the evidence was obtained unlawfully, there was an incorrect ruling by the court, on the trial level some error by the defense' - no, you actually have the wrong person here...they're actually innocent.\"</p>\n<p>Since Kelly implemented the policy two years ago, nine defendants - including Lashonda Moreland - have had their charges dropped before trial. Those cases include a reckless homicide by vehicle, four armed robberies and one murder. </p>\n<p>To the best of his knowledge, no other prosecutor in the country is attempting anything quite like it. Even the US Department of Justice has taken an interest in what is happening in St Clair County.</p>\n<p>\"I think it is a nightmare scenario for any prosecutor or any police officer to have investigated and prosecuted and convicted the wrong person,\" says Kelly. \"That strikes at our very sense of what our job is all about, which is to seek justice.\"</p>\n<p>There is an increasing body of evidence that suggests that local prosecutors had an enormous hand in the explosion of the US prison population. </p>\n<p>Theirs is an incredibly powerful position in the American criminal justice system, though the job is not well understood by the general public. Popular works of true crime journalism like Netflix's Making a Murderer and the podcast Serial are beginning to change that, and cast the prosecutors in each case in a fairly villainous light.</p>\n<p>\"Between 1994 and 2008, the main cause of rising prison populations is DAs [district attorneys] filing felony cases. This seems to be true across the United States,\" says John Pfaff, a professor at Fordham Law School.  \"DAs have kind of managed to avoid a lot of attention for a long time.\"</p>\n<p>Simply put, prosecutors decide what crimes to charge defendants with. A single crime can have a smorgasbord of potential charging options for prosecutors, ones that can come with short or extremely long mandatory minimum sentences. In the \"tough on crime\" era of the late 1990s, prosecutors started bringing harsher charges more often. Since the vast majority of cases settle with a plea deal, those charges and their sentences stick, meaning prosecutors essentially dictate how much time a person will serve. Only a tiny number of defendants go to trial to challenge the prosecutor. </p>\n<p>\"District attorneys have almost unfettered discretion on who to charge and who not to charge,\" says Pfaff. \"There's almost no judicial review of what kind of charges you choose, as long as the facts are there to back them up.\"</p>\n<p>The introduction of DNA evidence was a game changer in terms of public awareness of the choices prosecutors make. Suddenly, inmates who'd served decades in prison or been sentenced to the death were able to prove they were innocent. There have been<a href=\"http://www.law.umich.edu/special/exoneration/Pages/about.aspx\" class=\"story-body__link-external\"> 1,773 exonerations in the US</a> since 1989. </p>\n<p>This has shone a new light on hard-charging prosecutors who fought for the convictions in the first place, and then sometimes opposed the inmates' bid for freedom, even after DNA evidence contradicted their theory of the crime.</p>\n<p>\"I think because of some of the professional incentives to get convictions and maintain convictions, and political incentives to be tough on crime, the justice role takes a back seat to the advocacy role,\" says Northeastern University law professor Daniel Medwed, author of Prosecution Complex: America's Race to Convict and Its Impact on the Innocent. </p>\n<p>\"It's a little bit of human nature. Once you've made a decision to do something, it often takes a lot of countervailing evidence to get them to change their minds.\"</p>\n<p>But not all prosecutors have buried their heads in the sand when it comes to cases of actual innocence. In the last five years, the number of prosecutors who created so-called <a href=\"http://www.law.umich.edu/special/exoneration/Documents/Exonerations_in_2015.pdf\" class=\"story-body__link-external\">\"conviction integrity units\"</a>, or \"a division of a prosecutorial office that works to prevent, identify and correct false convictions\", have quadrupled. Some have set up screening committees to vet certain types of cases, like a prosecutor in New York state who decided that any case that relied on single eyewitness identification automatically warrants special attention.</p>\n<p>However, most remedies become available after defendants have already spent a significant amount of time behind bars. That was the conclusion of Jim Piper, first assistant state's attorney for St Clair County, when he found himself listening to a radio story about the highly lauded conviction integrity unit in Brooklyn, New York, while getting the oil in his car changed one day in 2013.</p>\n<p>\"So many cases had been overturned where young men had been sitting in jail for years and years before someone got around to vetting the prosecution,\" he recalls. \"It occurred to me - why are we doing that at the end? Why don't we have a procedure in place on the front end to vet prosecutions before they can become a conviction?\"</p>\n<p>St Clair County is an interesting laboratory for such an experiment. A county with a population of about 280,000, it encompasses the city of East St Louis, which at one time led the nation with its murder rate and has struggled since the 1970s with joblessness, drugs and violent crime. There are 32 arresting agencies of all sizes within the county - from a single part-time officer in Summerfield to the 1,700-officer Illinois State Police - who police everything from the urban industrial riverfront on the western border to the corn fields on the eastern edge. It has its share of official corruption. Kelly has charged 13 police officers in the county with various crimes, everything from theft of evidence to battering a suspect to forcing a woman to perform oral sex at a traffic stop.</p>\n<p>\"We have every kind of case you can think of,\" says Kelly, who grew up in the area.</p>\n<p>Around the time that Piper was getting that fateful oil change, the St Clair County state's attorney had three cases on his plate where defence lawyers genuinely believed their clients could be innocent. This is an anomaly - typically, defendants will challenge evidence, or request a lesser charge, but few claim to be actually innocent.</p>\n<p>In response, Kelly and Piper authored a simple protocol: If a defendant, their counsel or anyone else associated with the case brought forward compelling reasons to believe that the defendant was innocent, the defendant would be allowed to take a polygraph or a voice-stress test. Piper says that though they know these kinds of tests can be unreliable, being confronted with the chance to take one can filter out disingenuous defendants. Regardless of the results of the test - which are inadmissible at trial due to issues with the reliability of the technology - the assistant state's attorney (ASA) in charge of the case would also perform a \"de novo\" or \"from the beginning\" review of all the evidence. </p>\n<p>\"The ASA shall confirm that no other probative forensic testing can be conducted and that no other witnesses can be identified and interviewed,\" the protocol reads. \"At the end of this review, if both the ASA and supervising ASA(s) either no longer believe there exists a moral certainty of the defendant's guilt or believe there no longer exists a reasonable likelihood of conviction, then the case shall be dismissed without prejudice.\" </p>\n<p>One of the first tests of the programme was a murder case. Rodney Lewis admitted he stabbed 18-year-old Michael Barton Jr, but always maintained that it was in self defence. He passed his polygraph, and after re-examining the evidence, the assistant state's attorney dropped the charges. After 414 days in the St Clair County jail, he went home. </p>\n<p>\"I think it was his mother who went and picked him up,\" says Lewis' lawyer, Thomas Keefe III. \"She was very, very happy.\"</p>\n<p>Each of the nine cases has a different set of circumstances that led to charges being filed and ultimately dropped. Eyewitnesses identified the wrong perpetrators. Co-defendants implicated friends or acquaintances who were never there. In one case of an armed robbery of a mobile phone, the defendant falsely confessed after he says he was pressured by investigators. </p>\n<p>\"I thought I was going to jail anyway, so, I just said I did it,\" <a href=\"http://www.bnd.com/news/local/article55051595.html\" class=\"story-body__link-external\">he told the Belleville-News Democrat</a>, which broke the news of the programme. \"But I didn't know anything about it.\"</p>\n<p>So far, Kelly says just one claim that was investigated under the protocol actually yielded more evidence of the defendants' guilt, bolstering the state's case - a natural check, he believes, on the programme being abused.</p>\n<p>Some have pointed out that vetting cases before trial is a basic tenet of the work of a prosecutor, that Kelly's protocol just codifies what he is supposed to be doing anyway. If that's the case, the revolutionary step seems to be a simple willingness to publicly admit defendants were charged erroneously.</p>\n<p>\"I was honestly kind of surprised that they came forward and said, 'We dumped these [cases] because of actual innocence,'\" says Cathy MacElroy, a defence lawyer who has had two clients exonerated under the protocol.</p>\n<p>Kelly claims there have been no complaints from police about the programme, and he wants people to know that even though officers may initially arrest the wrong person, it is good police work that can correct an error as well.</p>\n<p>\"It's an imperfect world. We have good people in law enforcement and good people in the criminal justice system and good people as witnesses, but they can all make mistakes.\"</p>\n<p>In 19-year-old Brandon Jackson's case, it was the work of defence lawyers that ultimately cleared him. Another teenager implicated Jackson in a plot to lure a tattoo artist who made house calls to an abandoned home, and rob him of his money and equipment. When two of the perpetrators eventually took plea deals, they independently admitted that Jackson had nothing to do with the robbery.</p>\n<p>Still, Jackson - and other wrongfully charged individuals - has a hard time feeling grateful. He was 17 at the time of his arrest, and after spending months both in a juvenile detention centre then on house arrest, he couldn't graduate from high school. Now he lives at home with his mother and works in a warehouse. </p>\n<p>\"It was very stressful when I was locked up. I didn't know when I was coming home. When you get arrested for nothing, you don't know what is going on. Then they're offering you years of your life for nothing,\" he says. \"It took a whole year off my life.\"</p>\n<p><strong>More from the BBC on US criminal justice</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24119398\" class=\"story-body__link\">Why does Wisconsin send so many black people to jail?</a> - The state that locks up the highest percentage of black men</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-34705968\" class=\"story-body__link\">The US inmates charged per night in jail</a> - Reversing a widespread practice known as \"pay to stay\"</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-33681160\" class=\"story-body__link\">Why is it so hard to hire black police officers?</a> - One department's effort to diversify</p>\n<p>Then there's the fact that he had to pay the county $5 per day while he was on an ankle monitor, plus the cost of a landline to carry the monitor's signal. For his mother Ommie, a double amputee who lives on a fixed income, these were not trivial expenses, nor was hiring a private attorney. She says they're still paying their legal bill in instalments. </p>\n<p>Detavius McGary, who was accused of and then exonerated of charges that he robbed an elderly woman at gunpoint, spent 75 days in jail, then also had to pay a per diem fee for a year of ankle monitoring. His mother says she knows her son was lucky to have the chance to prove his innocence, but that she is now \"completely broke\". McGary says he wanted to sue the county but can't find a lawyer to take the case. And there were other costs.</p>\n<p>\"When they had me, I couldn't really see my kids,\" McGary says. \"I had so many good job opportunities, [but] then people, they weren't accepting me because of the case. I ain't really all the way recovered.\"</p>\n<p>Moreland's landlord attempted to evict her family over the arrest, until her defence lawyer Kristi Flint wrote a letter explaining the situation. Flint says that clients like Moreland are lucky that they could afford to bond out - a more indigent client who is actually innocent might have just pleaded guilty in order to get out of jail. Six of the nine defendants spent over a month in jail - the longest was Lewis' 414 days.</p>\n<p>\"I think that it is admirable that Brendan has put this out here as, 'Yes, innocent people get charged and when they do, you know, we dismiss it,'\" says Flint. \"But my question is, OK, so what do we do after this? What is he doing with this information? Lashonda is out money, the stresses that she went through - there's no making her whole.\"</p>\n<p>In his cluttered office on the second floor of the St Clair County courthouse - a map of East St Louis with violent crimes, usually gun violence, marked with red stickers in one corner - Kelly admits that his protocol is an experiment, one he can't guarantee will be successful. </p>\n<p>\"I think we're going to review it every year and just see how it's going. The public defenders, the prosecutors are in the trenches every day and we get continuous feedback,\" he says.</p>\n<p>Currently, the St Clair County state's attorney's office is looking at two new possible cases of actual innocence - this time cases of alleged sexual abuse of a child. </p>\n<p>Kelly does not think being open to admitting law enforcement mistakes makes him soft on crime. He considers himself an \"aggressive\" prosecutor who believes in law enforcement and its role in bringing about the precipitous decline in crime in the US since the 1990s. In his first year in office, he doubled the number of charges filed, though he sent many of those cases to drug and mental health courts. It's a line he says he walks because he believes there is no \"criminal justice without social justice\".</p>\n<p>\"Your local DA is accountable not to some person who appointed them in DC, or some state capitol somewhere, but is accountable to the people that they serve,\" he says. \"I think the prosecutor has the ability to be uniquely part of the solution, because again, we're the one entity whose duty is first and foremost to justice.\"</p>\n<p><i>Subscribe to the </i><a href=\"https://ssl.bbc.co.uk/newsletters/newsmagazine?ptrt=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine\" class=\"story-body__link\">BBC News Magazine's email newsletter</a><i> to get articles sent to your inbox. </i></p>"

			"date_published": 1461150898,
			"body": "\n<p class=\"story-body__introduction\">It may seem a peculiarly 21st Century preoccupation, but people in Shakespeare's England were also obsessed with food, writes Dr Joan Fitzpatrick. </p>\n<p>The 16th Century had plenty of diet books. </p>\n<p>Andrew Boorde's Compendious Regiment (1542) warns against eating and drinking to excess and often remarks upon the behaviour and diet of English people, noting that the English spend too long sitting at dinner and supper, feeding on heavy meats before lighter ones, which isn't good for their digestion. </p>\n<p>William Bullein's Government of Health (1558) takes the form of a dialogue between John, a self-confessed glutton, and Humphrey, a man of moderate habits. </p>\n<p>In Sir John Falstaff, Shakespeare's notorious glutton, we're presented with a character who defies both dietary and religious authorities by eating and drinking to excess whenever he pleases. </p>\n<p>It was generally believed that eating meat was divinely ordained and the dietary authors promoted meat as more healthy than a vegetarian diet, although it had to be considered whether or not a specific meat was suited to one's \"humour\", occupation, and even nationality. </p>\n<p>For example, bacon was thought fitting only for labourers or those involved in physical activity because it was difficult to digest and vigorous work would help this process. </p>\n<p>Chicken was regarded more favourably and was specifically recommended by some as a food for the sick, but it was expensive in Shakespeare's time so only the wealthy would eat the bird's flesh. </p>\n<p>In Shakespeare, capons are an indulgence - they are a favourite of Sir John Falstaff , and in The Two Gentlemen of Verona Launce's dog Crab steals a capon-leg from Sylvia's table. </p>\n<p>Boorde thought that beef was \"good meate for an English man\", a view that disagreed with ancient medical authorities such as Galen who believed that beef was a cold and heavy meat that provoked melancholy. </p>\n<p>It was thought that the cold English climate made English stomachs hotter than those of their Mediterranean neighbours and so better able to digest a meat like beef, which was also more tender in England as the cattle fed on pasture. </p>\n<p>In Shakespeare's time beef was thought to stir up courage, something emphasised by classical philosophers and evident in Henry V when the French Constable says of the English soldiers \"give them great meals of beef, and iron and steel, they will eat like wolves and fight like devils\". </p>\n<p>On the other hand, it was believed that beef caused stupidity, something Shakespeare refers to twice - in Twelfth Night when Andrew Aguecheek observes \"Methinks sometimes I have no more wit than a Christian or an ordinary man has; but I am a great eater of beef, and I believe that does harm to my wit\", and in Troilus and Cressida when Ajax curses Thersites: \"The plague of Greece upon thee, thou mongrel beef-witted lord!\" </p>\n<p>Beef might be served in pies, which the English were especially fond of. They also liked pasties, like today's, enclosed in a pastry crust and baked without a dish, which usually had only one filling, venison being a popular choice. </p>\n<p>In The Merry Wives of Windsor Master Page offers a venison pasty to Slender and Sir John Falstaff for dinner. The Lenten pie referred to by Mercutio in Romeo and Juliet wouldn't have contained any meat because Lent was a time for fasting and fish would have taken the place of meat at the dinner table.</p>\n<p>These days we are generally encouraged by health professionals to eat more fish and reduce our intake of red meat but in Shakespeare's time fish was considered inferior to meat. People viewed it as less nourishing, but it was also associated with the Catholic practice of not eating meat on Fridays. </p>\n<p>\"Fish days\" had been introduced by the government for economic reasons, to encourage the fishing industry and bring down the high price of meat, but the fish days were disliked by England's Protestants because they reminded them of England's Catholic past. </p>\n<p>In King Lear the disguised Kent says to Lear: \"I do profess to be no less than I seem, to serve him truly that will put me in trust, to love him that is honest, to converse with him that is wise and says little, to fear judgement, to fight when I cannot choose, and to eat no fish.\" </p>\n<p>This all suggests that Kent is a loyal Protestant and therefore a man who can be trusted. In Shakespeare's Henry IV part 2 Falstaff criticises Hal's sober brother, Prince John. \"There's never none of these demure boys come to any proof; for thin drink doth so overcool their blood, and making many fish meals, that they fall into a kind of male green-sickness; and then when they marry, they get wenches.\" </p>\n<p>\"Green sickness\" was an anaemic disease commonly attributed to a virgin's sexual fantasies that could be cured by a sexual encounter, and by the phrase \"get wenches\" Falstaff means \"produce girl children\". In other words, Falstaff is suggesting that Prince John is weak and effeminate because he is not properly nourished. </p>\n<p>However, Falstaff himself eats fish - a receipt in his pocket shows he has enjoyed \"anchovies and sack [Spanish white wine] after supper\". Anchovies and also herring, preserved in salt or pickled, were commonly sold as snacks in taverns, which would explain why they bother Sir Toby Belch in Twelfth Night (\"A plague o' these pickle herring!\"). While eating fish occasionally or as a snack was fine (at least acceptable to someone like Falstaff), to eat \"many fish meals\" was suspiciously Catholic.</p>\n<p>Animal flesh was preferred over fish and also considered healthier than \"fruit\", a term that included not only what we consider fruit today but also what we consider vegetables. Fruit was believed to be full of water that could cause a harmful imbalance in the body. It was generally believed that before the biblical Flood the human constitution was stronger and fruits contained less moisture but that after the Flood fruit provided less nourishment and made men more vulnerable to disease. </p>\n<p>It was believed to be at this point that God ordained the consumption of animal flesh by humans. Dietary authors advised eating fruit only occasionally, and before meals, avoiding the French habit of eating it after meals (for dessert). </p>\n<p>This is a shortened version of Joan Fitzpatrick's talk, \"'Wolf All?' Shakespeare and Food in Renaissance England,\" for Radio 3's <strong>The Essay</strong>, to be broadcast at 22:45 BST on 27 April - <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006x3hl\" class=\"story-body__link\">catch up on BBC iPlayer</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/timelines/z8k2p39\" class=\"story-body__link\">BBC iWonder - William Shakespeare: The Life and Legacy of England's Bard</a></p>\n<p>But people still ate fruit, which was sold in the streets and markets and picked from bushes and in hedgerows by those who could not afford to buy it or be fussy about what they ate. </p>\n<p>New and fashionable fruits, such as apricots and melons, were being imported into England from southern Europe and dried fruits such as raisins and figs were also available to those who could afford them. </p>\n<p>Pumpkin seeds have been found in excavations of the Rose and Globe playhouses and so it's possible that pumpkins or pumpkin seeds were consumed by wealthier members of the audience. Pumpkins were considered especially watery - in The Merry Wives of Windsor Mistress Ford describes Falstaff as \"this unwholesome humidity, this gross watery pumpkin\". </p>\n<p>For modern readers one of the strangest ideas to emerge from early modern dietary books is the fact that human breast-milk was recommended as a drink for adults as well as children. </p>\n<p>Bullein claims \"the best milk that helpeth against consumptions is woman's milk\". When we recognise this, references to milk and milkiness in the plays begin to make more sense. </p>\n<p>Lady Macbeth worries that her husband is \"too full o' th' milk of human kindness\". The line is clearly figurative, but might there be a literal suggestion too? </p>\n<p>These accusations of milkiness suggest two kinds of weakness - the producers of milk were weak because they were women, and the consumers were the weak, the old, the sick, or babies. </p>\n<p>Milk from animals and other \"white meats\", such as butter and cheese, were usually manufactured by women and they evoked distinct national stereotypes, butter being especially associated with the Dutch and cheese with the Welsh. </p>\n<p>Boorde recommends that butter be eaten \"in the morning before other meats\" (or foods), noting that \"French men will eat it after meat\" and \"Dutch men doth eat it at all times in the day\". </p>\n<p>In The Merry Wives of Windsor Master Ford claims he wouldn't trust a Fleming with his butter but most of the references to butter in this play and in Henry IV part 1 are made by or about Falstaff. In The Merry Wives of Windsor Sir Hugh Evans, conforms to stereotype by looking forward to a dessert of cheese: \"I will make an end of my dinner; there's pippins and cheese to come\". </p>\n<p>Pippins, a variety of apple, were considered difficult to digest, especially if eaten raw and cheese was thought helpful to close the stomach after a meal. Cheese was traditionally a food for the poor but after 1600 it became more fashionable, especially hard cheese that took more time to mature and was imported from abroad.  </p>\n<p>In Shakespeare's time people thought that sugar was healthy, indeed it was used as a medicine to treat lots of conditions such as stomach problems. Boorde approved of all food and drink containing sugar as especially nutritious and it was thought that old people craved sugar.</p>\n<p>Like our ancestors we too believe that some foods are better for us than others, even if we wouldn't agree with them about what those foods are. But we also share with our ancestors the belief that good health, above all other things, is what matters most. </p>\n<p>This year marks 400 years since William Shakespeare's death.

It will resettle children and their families \"where the UNHCR deems resettlement is in the best interests of the child.\"</p>\n<p>Several hundred people are expected to be resettled in the UK by April 2017 \"with a view to resettling up to 3,000 over the lifetime of this Parliament\", the government said. </p>\n<p>The five-year Syrian civil war has created more than 4.5 million refugees across the region - half of them children in need of food, education and a home.

The group was motivated by profit, so we can only speculate that some of these weapons would have been sold to whoever had the means to pay the asking price.\"</p>\n<p>After Shilling and Defraine were found guilty of conspiring to import and sell the weapons, the judge, Mr Justice Topolski, told them they both faced the possibility of life sentences.</p>\n<p>\"Criminals like you at or near the top of criminal organisations invariably pose a serious danger to the public,\" he said. </p>\n<p>A life sentence would come in for \"serious consideration\", he added.</p>\n<p>David Payne, 43, Richard Rye, 24, and Christopher Owen, 30, had already pleaded guilty to smuggling the weapons into the country. </p>\n<p>Payne and Rye also admitted the second count relating to conspiracy to sell the arsenal.</p>\n<p>All five will be sentenced on 13 May. </p>\n<p>The guns - 22 assault rifles similar to AK-47s, and nine Skorpion sub-machine guns - were brought into the UK from Boulogne on a 38ft (12m) cruiser, the MV Albernina, the court heard.</p>\n<p>All had originally been deactivated but were reactivated before they, along with a large amount of ammunition, were smuggled up the Medway into Kent, arriving near Cuxton Marina on 10 August last year.</p>\n<p>But detectives had the plotters under surveillance and swooped to seize the cache before it could be buried and then sold, the court heard.</p>\n<p>The court heard each of the 22 Czech-made assault rifles would have fetched up to £4,000, even though they were sold at \"shockingly low\" prices in Eastern Europe.</p>\n<p>The Skorpion machine guns, originally developed for use by Czech special forces, would have netted £3,500 apiece.</p>\n<p>On 11 August, the gang was seen by investigators unloading the cruiser, the jury was told, and a number of large heavy bags were loaded into a white van which was driven away by Payne. </p>\n<p>Shilling and Defraine were arrested outside a branch of the DIY store Homebase, where they had just bought spades and other tools, the court heard.</p>"

			"date_published": 1461238750,
			"body": "\n<p class=\"story-body__introduction\">Mitsubishi Motors has admitted rigging data on some of its models' fuel efficiency. About 625,000 cars sold in Japan were affected, and the production of the relevant models has been halted. </p>\n<p>The inaccurate tests involved 157,000 of its own cars - the ek Wagon and eK Space - as well as 468,000 vehicles produced for Nissan - the Dayz and Dayz Roox.</p>\n<p>Car companies try to outdo each other on how fuel-efficient their models are. It impresses consumers because it's good for the environment, and it's easy on the wallet at the petrol station. </p>\n<p>Fuel efficiency is tested by putting cars on what is essentially a treadmill where they run at a certain speed and fuel consumption is measured. </p>\n<p>Mitsubishi appears to have overinflated the tyres, which gave better results on the fuel efficiency test.</p>\n<p>Imagine inflating your bicycle tyres to the maximum and going up a hill, then letting half the air out and going up the same hill again. It's much harder. The extra muscle you need gives you an idea of the extra fuel that a car would burn through. </p>\n<p>The controversy comes hard on the heels of the Volkswagen emissions scandal but is slightly different. </p>\n<p>Volkswagen installed hidden software in its diesel models that detected when an official emissions test was being conducted. The software would then lower the emission so the test readings were more favourable. </p>\n<p>So VW rigged the level of harmful gases coming from the exhaust pipe to make their cars look greener than they were. </p>\n<p>Mitsubishi rigged the fuel consumption readings so their cars would appear to use less fuel than they actually did. </p>\n<p>Mitsubishi is a somewhat confusing brand. There are a whole host of independent companies that share the name and trace their origins back to the original Mitsubishi company founded in 1870 in the shipping industry. </p>\n<p>The current companies though are entirely independent from each other. </p>\n<p>That means you will find the name in aviation, banking, air conditioners, the nuclear and chemical industry, optics and of course, cars. </p>\n<p>Mitsubishi Motors is the sixth biggest car maker in Japan and number 16 worldwide. </p>\n<p>Large-scale production got under way in the 1960s. In 1977 the company entered the European market and in 1982 the US market. Annual car production currently stands at 1,218,853 vehicles. </p>\n<p>The current scandal is at Mitsubishi Motors. Any damage to the brand name though, might spill over to the other companies. </p>\n<p>It's not the first time that Mitsubishi Motors has been in the headlines for misconduct. </p>\n<p>In the early 2000s, the company had to admit to lying about defects in its cars for decades.</p>\n<p>Back then, an internal investigation found that the firm had covered up faults since 1977 and repaired cars secretly, instead of reporting the problems to the transport ministry. </p>\n<p>The cover-up led to huge recalls, criminal charges against several employees and a cost of billions to the company. </p>"

			"body": "\n<p class=\"story-body__introduction\">Elections for police and crime commissioners will take place across most of England and Wales on 5 May. Here is a guide to what PCCs do and how the system, introduced in 2012, works.</p>\n<p>PCCs are elected representatives who work to ensure police forces in England and Wales are running effectively. They replaced police authorities in 2012 and were intended to bring a public voice to policing. </p>\n<p>The government insists PCCs are not there to run local police forces but to hold them to account and respond to the needs of the public. </p>\n<p>There is no PCC in London because the mayor is responsible for policing.</p>\n<p>In the first PCC elections held in November 2012, 192 candidates stood for the 41 posts covering England and Wales. </p>\n<p class=\"ns_super_impact__fig\">15%</p>\n<p>turnout</p>\n<p class=\"ns_super_impact__fig\">192</p>\n<p>candidates</p>\n<p><span class=\"ns_impact__fig\">16</span> Conservatives elected </p>\n<p><span class=\"ns_impact__fig\">13</span> Labour </p>\n<p><span class=\"ns_impact__fig\">12</span> Independents </p>\n<p>Sixteen Conservative PCCs were elected, 13 from Labour and 12 Independents. Among the successful independent candidates were eight former police officers, one of Wales' most senior barristers, and an ex-pilot. Six women were elected (from 35 who stood as candidates) and 35 men.</p>\n<p>In this year's election on 5 May there are 40 votes being held - because Greater Manchester is not holding an election. The region is set to vote for the new post of elected mayor in 2017 and the powers and responsibilities of the PCC will fall to the mayor. Since last May PCC Tony Lloyd, who was elected in 2012, has held the post of interim mayor. </p>\n<p>This time there are 188 candidates standing. Labour and the Conservatives are fielding candidates in each area, with UKIP putting forward 34 candidates and the Liberal Democrats 30. Of those elected in 2012, 26 are standing again, as are two successful candidates from by-elections held in 2014.</p>\n<p>PCCs' responsibilities include: </p>\n<p>Police and crime commissioners cannot tell the police how to do their job - despite having some control over the direction of a force. The operational independence of the police is protected by legislation. </p>\n<p>New measures proposed in the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/policing-and-crime-bill\" class=\"story-body__link-external\">Policing and Crime Bill</a>, which is currently passing through Parliament, would enable PCCs to <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-34224491\" class=\"story-body__link\">take on responsibility for fire and rescue services</a>. The Home Office said it wanted to encourage more \"efficiency and effectiveness\" but the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-35138665\" class=\"story-body__link\">Fire Brigades Union called the idea \"dangerous\"</a> and a \"half-baked suggestion\" and the Local Government Association said it saw no \"pressing need\" for the change.</p>\n<p>Public elections for the first police and crime commissioners took place on 15 November 2012 in 41 police force areas across England and Wales, not including London. The elections - 37 in England and four in Wales - were described as the biggest shake-up of policing for almost 50 years but the turnout was the lowest in peacetime Britain. One polling station in Newport, Gwent, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-20355358\" class=\"story-body__link\">was visited by no voters at all</a>.</p>\n<p>Fewer than 15% of voters turned out in the 41 police areas electing a PCC, prompting the Electoral Commission to hold <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-21836934\" class=\"story-body__link\">a review into how the polls were conducted</a>. The inquiry found 80% of voters felt they did not have enough information to make an informed choice. The commission's chairwoman Jenny Watson said: \"The government took a number of decisions about how to run these elections that we did not agree with.\"</p>\n<p>All registered voters are entitled to take part in the elections. The supplementary vote system is used in all force areas where more than two candidates stand, with voters marking the ballot paper with their first and second choice of candidate. In the 2016 elections there are at least three candidates standing for each post.</p>\n<p>A PCC's term of office is four years, with a maximum of two terms.</p>\n<p>The idea of giving local people more of a say in how the police in their area are run had been championed for years by some Conservatives as a way of boosting local democracy - but it only became party policy at the 2010 general election.  </p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/sites/default/files/resources/coalition_programme_for_government.pdf\" class=\"story-body__link-external\">coalition agreement</a> published after the May 2010 election contained a pledge to make the police \"more accountable through oversight by a directly elected individual\". The proposal was fleshed out in the white paper \"<a href=\"http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/consultations/policing-21st-century/policing-21st-full-pdf?view=Binary\" class=\"story-body__link-external\">Policing in the 21st Century</a>\" and enacted in the <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2012/1129/made\" class=\"story-body__link-external\">Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act</a>, which became law in 2011.</p>\n<p>London has a directly elected mayor, who acts as the police and crime commissioner for the Metropolitan police area. London's police and crime panel is formed from a committee of elected London Assembly members. The commissioner of the Metropolitan Police continues to be a Royal appointment on the advice of the home secretary. </p>\n<p>In 2014 Chancellor George Osborne <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-29876939\" class=\"story-body__link\">announced plans for an elected mayor for Greater Manchester</a> as part of a project to hand more devolved power to the north.</p>\n<p>Manchester's PCC <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-32929721\" class=\"story-body__link\">Tony Lloyd became the city's interim mayor</a> in May 2015, retaining the PCC responsibilities when he transferred to his new role. Mancunians will vote for an elected mayor for the first time in 2017 and, as in London, the mayor will continue to oversee policing.</p>\n<p>PCCs are required to swear an oath of impartiality when they are elected to office. This echoes the commitment police officers make to serve every member of the public impartially. Before the introduction of PCCs, the government promised the way investigations were carried out would not become political.</p>\n<p>PCCs have to answer to the public - the government has said their performance \"should be judged solely by the electorate\" - and more than two-thirds of the commissioners are asking voters to re-elect them in 2016.</p>\n<p>And people can complain to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) if they think their PCC has broken the law.</p>\n<p>In addition to this, Police and Crime Panels were set up in each force area to scrutinise and challenge the actions and decisions of each PCC. A panel may require the attendance of the PCC, has the power to suspend them from office because of a criminal offence, or exercise a veto over a proposed candidate for chief constable. </p>\n<p>But in July 2013, less than a year into the new system, the Home Affairs Select Committee <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-23387324\" class=\"story-body__link\">said it seemed \"very easy\" for a PCC to remove a chief constable for \"insubstantial\" reasons</a> and advised police and crime panels should be more vigorous in analysing contentious decisions by PCCs, such as the sacking of a chief constable.</p>\n<p>In England, panels are mainly made up of representatives from each local authority in a police force area. In Wales, they are free-standing public bodies, set up and maintained by the secretary of state, rather than local authority committees.</p>\n<p>When the role was introduced, ministers insisted the cost of PCCs and police and crime panels must be no greater than the abolished police authorities. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-22624096\" class=\"story-body__link\">In 2013, BBC research</a> revealed the salaries of the majority of the PCCs were between £70,000 and £85,000, although the commissioners overseeing the three major forces of Greater Manchester, West Yorkshire and West Midlands were each receiving £100,000. It was also calculated that PCCs across England and Wales had employed at least 449 people in the six months after their introduction.</p>\n<p>Salaries are recommended by the Senior Salaries Review Body, which advises on the remuneration of those in public office, and approved by the home secretary.</p>\n<p>During the first year PCCs were in office, there were four investigations carried out by the IPCC, as well as investigations by the CPS into expenses claims. And MPs on the Home Affairs Committee <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-22636857\" class=\"story-body__link\">warned ministers were failing to properly monitor the salaries</a> and standards of PCCs.</p>\n<p>In 2014, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-29220535\" class=\"story-body__link\">South Yorkshire's PCC Shaun Wright resigned</a> over the Rotherham child abuse scandal. He had faced demands to step down in the wake of a report that found at least 1,400 children were abused in the town from 1997 to 2013. Mr Wright, who had been the head of children's services in Rotherham between 2005 and 2010, eventually said he was stepping down as PCC to ensure the \"important issues\" outlined in the report could be discussed and considered \"without distraction\".</p>\n<p>Home Secretary Theresa May had called for Mr Wright to stand down and - in the few days before he did so - the controversy prompted then Deputy Prime Minister and Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg, whose party helped pass the legislation that created PCCs, to describe the role as a \"discredited experiment\" and <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-29172812\" class=\"story-body__link\">say PCCs should be abolished</a>.</p>\n<p>Just three months after being elected Lincolnshire PCC Alan Hardwick suspended his temporary chief constable Neil Rhodes over an employment dispute. But <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-lincolnshire-21964844\" class=\"story-body__link\">a judicial review into the suspension ruled in favour of Mr Rhodes</a>, with a judge calling the suspension \"irrational and perverse\", and he was reinstated. The row also saw the chairman of the crime panel stand down. Speaking at the time, Mr Hardwick, who is not standing for re-election, said he accepted the judge's decision and added: \"The rules governing PCCs don't really envisage this sort of thing, there is more guidance needed.\"</p>\n<p>Kent PCC Ann Barnes, an Independent, has been a controversial figure during her tenure and announced in March she <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-kent-35794996\" class=\"story-body__link\">would not be standing for re-election</a>. A report last year found she <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-kent-34647110\" class=\"story-body__link\">may not have been properly insured</a> when she was in a car crash and she was criticised for <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-kent-27478691\" class=\"story-body__link\">taking part in a documentary</a> and for her appointments of youth commissioners. In a <a href=\"http://kent-pcc.gov.uk/home.php?entry_id=1457787639\" class=\"story-body__link-external\">statement on her website</a> when she said she would not be standing in the 2016 election, Ms Barnes said the people of Kent had been getting a better service and added: \"I am content that I have delivered what I said I would.\"</p>\n<p>Cumbria's PCC, Richard Rhodes, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-22220707\" class=\"story-body__link\">apologised for using a chauffeur-driven ca</a>r that cost £700 of taxpayers' money for just two trips and admitted he had failed to check how much it would cost. The former head teacher paid the money back and said at the time he understood the public concern over the case. Cumbria Police arrested three people in connection with leaking the information but no charges were brought. Mr Rhodes is not standing for re-election.</p>\n<p>When he was just over six months into the role Bob Jones, the West Midlands PCC, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-birmingham-22797713\" class=\"story-body__link\">said PCCs should be scrapped</a> and replaced with something more efficient and less party political. Mr Jones <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-birmingham-28108283\" class=\"story-body__link\">died in July 2014</a> aged 59 and a by-election was held to replace him the following month.

They also feared commissioners could interfere with the running of police forces. </p>\n<p>Critics have also questioned whether PCCs have real legitimacy following the low turnout of just over 15% in the 2012 elections.</p>\n<p>Police authorities, first established in 1964 to hold chief constables to account, had oversight of the police before PCCs. They were made up of local councillors and independent, appointed members. But the coalition government concluded police authorities were \"invisible\" and needed replacing with elected commissioners and police and crime panels. </p>"

			"date_published": 1461194750,
			"body": "\n<p class=\"story-body__introduction\">William Shakespeare may be widely regarded as finest playwright in the English language, but when he put his quill down he was also a savvy businessman.</p>\n<p>In Elizabethan London, the original Globe Theatre could accommodate 3,000 people. Commoners or \"groundlings\" paid a penny to stand in the open air, while the gentry parted with as many as six pennies to sit on cushions in the covered galleries.</p>\n<p>Notwithstanding the fact that the Globe burned down in 1613, Shakespeare's share in the playhouse made him a tidy fortune.</p>\n<p>He also part-owned another London theatre and a production company. And back in his hometown of Stratford-upon-Avon in Warwickshire, he invested widely in land and property, and reportedly bought and sold grain.</p>\n<p>By the time Shakespeare died on 23 April 1616 - 400 years ago on Saturday - he was a very wealthy man. In today's money he would have comfortably been a millionaire.</p>\n<p>Fast-forward four centuries, and Shakespeare would likely be rather pleased that his work and legacy continues to support a large and lucrative industry, which is far from being limited to the sale of theatre tickets and employment of actors.</p>\n<p>Instead, Shakespeare supports a substantially wider business community - from hotels and restaurants in Stratford, to walking tours in London, bars near a balcony in the Italian city of Verona, sales of books and memorabilia, and even leadership classes for businessmen and women. </p>\n<p>It is definitely not much ado about nothing.</p>\n<p>Piers Ibbotson says there are so many lessons from Shakespeare about the perils and pitfalls of power that it has provided him with an inexhaustible fund of material for his management and leadership workshops over the past two decades.</p>\n<p>\"The plays of Shakespeare are case studies for central human dilemmas,\" says the 61-year-old, who is part of Warwick Business School's Create unit.</p>\n<p>\"The plays are so rich, and so complex, that there are actual situations to examine. Acting things out is very powerful, people can physically get inside situations.\"</p>\n<p>Create uses Shakespeare's plays to guide students, and business clients, through numerous difficult business situations.</p>\n<p>Macbeth, for example, is viewed as a study into the limits of ambition, while The Tempest is seen as a metaphor for a perfect storm of workplace rivalry.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, A Midsummer Night's Dream is used to explore business transformation, and the Merchant of Venice teaches contract enforcement.</p>\n<p>Mr Ibbotson says: \"Shakespeare is such a wonderful asset and of course you're always using such powerful language -  it allows people to articulate much more subtle and complex ideas than thin business language.\"</p>\n<p>Richard Olivier, 54, is another person who uses Shakespeare's plays to teach good leadership and business practice.</p>\n<p>The son of Sir Laurence Olivier, the UK's most famous 20th Century Shakespearian actor, Mr Olivier says: \"Shakespeare is an amazing ethical teacher.</p>\n<p>\"Apart from the history plays, there is no play where the bad guy ends up in charge at the end.\"</p>\n<p>Clients of Mr Olivier's company Olivier Mythodrama have included NHS management, the Metropolitan Police and Daimler-Benz. His charges range from £5,000 for a half-day session to as much as £40,000 for a six-day intensive course.</p>\n<p>Mr Olivier adds: \"There's huge drama in leadership, and Shakespeare was probably the first playwright to portray the human drama of leadership in three-dimensional form.\"</p>\n<p>The area known as Shakespeare's England (which takes in the towns of Stratford, Royal Leamington Spa, Kenilworth and Warwick) received 9.94 million tourists in 2014, according to the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust, the charity that cares for Shakespeare heritage sites.</p>\n<p>It adds that the total value of tourism to the local economy is in the region of £635m, which supports some 11,150 jobs.</p>\n<p>Alisan Cole, from the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust, says: \"2014, the 450th anniversary of Shakespeare's birth, was our record year with 820,000 visitors, and we're expecting 2016 to be on a par with it, if not exceed it.\"</p>\n<p>In terms of attracting hungry and thirsty tourists, Hathaway Cafe is perfectly positioned in the centre of Stratford, and is just a short walk from the Royal Shakespeare Theatre.</p>\n<p>Manager and owner Rick Allen, 51, says that during the summer the warren-like Tudor-era teashop is packed with Asian customers, typically from China and Taiwan, playing £13 a head for afternoon tea (or £18 with a glass of prosecco).</p>\n<p>\"Off-peak we get around 1,000 customers per week, but it's well over 2,000 per week during the peak season of July and August,\" he says.</p>\n<p>Mr Allen adds that Birmingham Airport's new runway extension, which caters for the growing number of flights from East Asia, has been a fillip for the business.</p>\n<p>\"We're literally getting calls from people saying 'we've got a booking for 24 and we're on our way'. In August it's mayhem - good fun, but mayhem.\"</p>\n<p>Down in London former actor Declan McHugh, 55, has been taking people on Shakespeare-themed guided walks since 1999.</p>\n<p>He says his business - Shakespeare in the City Walk - has grown thanks to positive word of mouth, and good reviews on websites such as TripAdvisor.</p>\n<p>Mr McHugh adds that London is a rich seam for Shakespeare fans since the playwright spent most of his working life moving through the then murky and bohemian world of the Elizabethan city's playhouses.</p>\n<p>Charging £10 per adult, he says the Shakespeare anniversary year is shaping up as a record one for his business.</p>\n<p>\"I've been doing this for 17 years and I'm starting to reap the rewards,\" he says.</p>\n<p>While he says it's hard to give exact numbers, he normally gets between five and 10 people meeting him outside Blackfriars underground station every Friday at 11am. But that's just for the public walks.</p>\n<p>\"Then I also do regular walks privately for colleges and universities from across the globe, plus there's UK institutions and businesses. I have the Girl Guides coming next Monday, for example.</p>\n<p>\"Private walks usually are for 15-20 people but I have done the tour for 60 people before,\" he says.</p>\n<p>Mr McHugh says his fascination for Shakespeare began at 11 years old, and now he regards the Bard as pretty much \"his guardian angel\".</p>"

			"title": "BBC How four men survived as hostages of IS",
			"date_published": 1461106854,
			"body": "\n<p class=\"story-body__introduction\">In his classic novel 1984, George Orwell writes about Room 101 - a torture chamber where you are subjected to your worst nightmare, the worst thing in the world, to break your resistance. </p>\n<p>To survive any such place of profound pain is the greatest of gifts, a triumph of the human spirit. In our time, surviving brutal captivity at the hands of so-called Islamic State in Syria must certainly count as such a triumph. </p>\n<p>When four former hostages came together this month for their first reunion since they were freed, at different times, two years ago, it was a celebration of friendship forged in the most threatening of circumstances, a remembrance of an agonising ordeal.</p>\n<p>In the BBC radio programme Held Hostage in Syria they recall months without sunlight, weeks chained together, days upon days of beatings. There was too little food, and so much longing for clean clothes, a proper toilet, and most of all, freedom.</p>\n<p>But it was also an affirmation of extraordinary resilience. They had all won what they call a \"game of survival\" which lasted about one long terrible year of torment for all of them.</p>\n<p>They played this game in their own individual ways to preserve themselves, and some semblance of human dignity. Federico Motka, an Italian aid worker, lowered his gaze and raised his guard to avoid his captors' efforts to demean him. French war correspondent Didier Francois pushed back and stared them straight in the eye. Danish photographer Daniel Rye Ottosen, an elite gymnast, did the splits to convince them he was not a spy.  French blogger Pierre Torres took beatings, but satisfaction, from ignoring their orders. </p>\n<p>And they played this game together, helping each other endure their ordeal, as IS guards of different nationalities deployed diverse tactics of physical and psychological torture to try to break them. Only one, Daniel Rye, was subjected to such brutality that he tried to take his own life - but the guards stopped him, and his fellow hostages brought him back to health. </p>\n<p>There were real games too: chess, with pieces fashioned from cheese cartons with nail clippers; draughts (checkers), with the seeds of olives and dates; a self-styled lecture series on everything from carp fishing, to sailing, and how to dive into a small pool. This is how they escaped in their mind.</p>\n<p>At one point in 2013-2014 19 men carrying a Western or a Russian passport were held hostage together in one small room. An adjacent room was a cell for five women. One by one, they have been freed for ransom or executed. Of this group of male hostages only one, British journalist John Cantlie, is left and one woman whose name has not been made public. </p>\n<p>Several journalists and aid workers, and hundreds of Syrians, have not lived to tell of their ordeal. We know of their fate from grotesque videos on social media which have brought a sickening cinematic slickness to medieval beheadings.</p>\n<p>These are the stories of four men who went to Syria to report on a punishing war, or to try to ease suffering in this humanitarian crisis of our time. They all went to help in some way. They all found themselves in a living hell.</p>\n<p>In our studio, they return to the dark, dreadful rooms they escaped two years ago. At moments they struggle to find the right words. At moments, they still can't draw them out. There's deep sorrow, but also smiles. \"When we meet,\" reflects Didier Francois, \"we can share things that we can't share with anyone else… it's important.\"</p>\n<p>What they can share with us is a compelling chronicle of our time. </p>\n<p>DIDIER: The way it happened was very fast. I crossed the border in the morning, around 10:30am, and by 11am I was caught. As soon as you crossed from Turkey into Syria, the trap was already closing in. There was one car behind us and another in front, five guys came out and it was all very professional. There was no way to escape. They took our glasses off, they took our shoes off so we couldn't run away, we were blindfolded and they took our phones away. After this, you put yourself in survival mode immediately.</p>\n<p>PIERRE: I graduated as an oceanographer, but in 2011 I was captivated with the Arab Spring. I was very interested in the city of Raqqa. It's now the self-declared capital of the Islamic State, but at that time, it was the first capital freed from the Assad regime… On the day I got caught, I was just two minutes from my friend's house, where I was staying. A car stopped to the left of me and four or five people were in it wearing ski masks. But at that time in Raqqa, that wasn't a scary sight. It was normal to see people in a car wearing ski masks in the middle of the afternoon. I just thought, \"Oh maybe they're just going to ask me what the time is.\" But then I saw the barrels of the pistols they were holding and realised it was something else. They started to punch me like hell from everywhere with the guns and the barrels of the guns. At one point I began to collapse and I saw that the top of the car was covered in blood. I then realised that the blood was coming from my head.</p>\n<p>FEDERICO: I was with David Haines [the British aid worker] in the car. We had just spent the day talking to community groups. We went to Atma camp just on the border and then we got back in the car and started driving to our safe house. I was actually on the phone with my boss at the time and didn't notice anything until there were suddenly two black cars around us. One in front and one behind. About eight fighters piled out of it and there was a lot of shouting. I just dropped my phone on to the seat next to me - which still had my boss on the other end of the line. In a blur, you just get pulled out of the car and put down on the floor. I remember there was a man on a bike just cycling past with a look on his face that just said, \"Oh crap.\" Then we were put into the boot of a car - but it didn't close properly so they took us out and put us back in again. Then we just sped off.</p>\n<p>DANIEL: The guard said to me \"Daniel, why do you have such wide shoulders? You look like a guy from the army or something.\" And I said, \"No, no, I'm not. I'm a former elite gymnast. That's why I look the way I do.\" And he replied, \"But that's why some of the other guards think that you're a spy.\" That was when I first got really scared. I tried to show him that I wasn't a spy, and that I really was a gymnast by doing the splits there and then on the mattress. And this guy was saying, \"Stop doing that. I'm supposed to interrogate you. I'm supposed to torture you.\" Then some other guys came down and they started to yell at me, shout at me and punch me. Many of the foreign fighters - the European or Western fighters that came - tended to be a bit more aggressive towards us. At some point, I remember they came in and they took me up, and I had to dance some kind of tango. That was really strange because you really felt like you were humiliated.   </p>\n<p>DIDIER: The difficult thing when you lose your freedom is that there are no rules. You are outside the rule of law. The guards are the ones who make the decisions and you've lost all your control. So the only thing you can keep for yourself is your dignity. You have to understand that they all had one objective - to keep us under their thumb. There were no nice guards or good guards - all of them were bad. But their strategies to control us as a group were different. Some resorted to extreme violence and others used more sophisticated tactics. The French guards were more into playing games with our minds, while the British were more into a direct approach - control and violence. And we never knew which method would be used. They came on a regular basis to beat you up with no reason, to show you that they are in charge. They put some pepper spray on my blindfold. There was no water and no food for four days. </p>\n<p>PIERRE: I had a massive guilt complex at one stage and it was bothering me all the time. I actually felt like I had accepted some things too easily and I wanted to be able to fight and struggle. So at one stage, I targeted a very young guard - I think he was from Tunisia. I stood in front of him and made direct eye contact. Those guards were so sensitive to body language and eye contact. So I stood in front of him very proud, and with my eyes I was saying, \"You're a piece of shit.\"… Then at one stage, that guard wanted to punch me. He came up to me holding a stick, and he tried to take me down with it, but I stood up. A few minutes later, he came back and he was so angry. He was really out of control. He took me away from the jail where I was and beat the crap out of me with the stick. Then he took me back to the cell with the others, and I was suffering a lot all over my body. He'd also punched me in the stomach so I had shit on my pants. But I was euphoric. It was like taking cocaine or something. I was feeling so great. I loved that moment and really appreciated it. It was worth it. </p>\n<p>DANIEL: I tried to focus on all the bright things in my situation. I started counting a lot, talking to myself, and started making up projects in my head. I think the survival mode that you go into when you're by yourself is very interesting. It's really, really difficult. You're just there with your brain, and yourself.  I could have good times when I thought everything seemed fine, and I could have bad times. When I look back now, I had different states of mind. I had the shock at the beginning. The second part was about accepting and adapting. The third part was thinking that this was my everyday life. This is when you become a good hostage. And for me, this is actually when the time started to go by faster. There was a point when I thought, \"I will not survive.\" I tried to escape and I tried to hang myself and I was rescued by the bad guys. They came in and they took me down and everything was OK, and I really felt that they would not kill me. But my point is that I went through that and suddenly I came to a new sense of self where the situation was completely different. </p>\n<p>FEDERICO: We were split up, me and Dave [David Haines]. Dave had given me three pieces of advice which I will never forget: always tell the truth; if we get split up make a routine; and play the game. They took me out and drove me off to another place, just a completely black cell with a toilet, and for about three weeks - nothing. Days and days of solitude. I would pace up and down and do these things like chatting to my parents and my sister in my head and try to sleep again. Anything to pass the days. We only really became a group with the other hostages much later on, at the end of July. Our only ability to keep dignity was to try to keep as clean as you could. But we were going through a routine of having our hands cuffed behind our back at night and our hands cuffed in front during the day. On some occasions when they told us that we smelt too bad, the handcuffs would be taken off so we could take our T-shirts off and wash our armpits with a little bit of water. That was for me the way to maintain dignity… I'd been wearing the same clothes that I'd had on that afternoon that we got caught up right until July - even longer than that actually. I just took every opportunity whenever I went to the toilet to wash them in water. It was my obsession.</p>\n<p>DIDIER: This cloth is a cotton scarf in which I had hidden some chess pieces, made from Vache Qui Rit cheese boxes. We played chess a lot.</p>\n<p>PIERRE: We organised lectures, we organised sport and we organised games. </p>\n<p>FEDERICO: We used blankets to make a boat on the ground and I then tried to explain with my very limited physics how sails work and boats go faster. Alan Henning gave a lecture on carp fishing I think. </p>\n<p>[Pierre gave a lecture on how to make iron. Daniel gave a lecture on diving from a high board into a small pool.]</p>\n<p>DANIEL: I remember my brain was thirsty. It wanted any information no matter what it was, as long as it was somebody talking about something from the real world.</p>\n<p>FEDERICO: There was another game that we did that was really great - we did versions of Werewolf, also called Mafia. Whoever was narrating created the plot and then handed out characters and then people had to behave in that way. We had prima donnas and a prostitute at one point. </p>\n<p>DIDIER: We were obsessed with food - that was a long part of every discussion. Every night we tried to imagine a menu with the \"non-dessert of the day\". So it was the non-menu and a non-dessert that we would never get. When I got out, the first meal given to me was from the French intelligence team who were part of the army. It was when I was on the military plane, they opened the cans of cassoulet with beers. That was great. </p>\n<p>DANIEL: I think the whole time the hostages and I were sitting inside together, we shared the same dream of crossing the border together. That wherever we were, we would go to a hotel together and there would be a buffet. We spoke a lot about that buffet, and how 19 guys would sit around the table and share it together. A day that should be a very happy day; crossing the border, going into freedom and going back to our families. And there was still some part of me staying behind in Syria saying, \"It's only the end when all of us can sit around this table and eat our buffet.\"</p>\n<p>DIDIER: I think among all the hostages, we still have a strong bond. You can't live what we went through without keeping something. Even the bad parts of it. When we meet we share things that you cannot share with anyone else. It's very important.</p>\n<p>PIERRE: Some of us were coming out of really tough experiences, we all had difficulties and we were all such different characters, but we really teamed up with each other. We built up something very strong between us.</p>\n<p>FEDERICO: I had received a proof-of-life question - the colour of the bedroom wall in my mum's house is orange. It was one of the most bittersweet moments of my life. Up until then I had to believe that David [Haines] and I would be released together and that was the moment that I realised it wasn't happening and I cried like a baby. Dave was sitting next to me and he hugged me and everyone was really nice. They said, \"Take this chance.\" David knew by then that things weren't looking great. My proof of life meant his loss of a certain level of hope.</p>\n<p>[David Haines was beheaded in September 2014, four months after Federico was released.]</p>\n<p>DANIEL: When I was released, we were eight guys left - me and a German guy, and three Brits and three Americans. I got my proof of life, then the German guy got his proof of life a few days later. At that point it was very clear that they were not negotiating for the Americans and the Brits. The day that I was released, I was sitting in a corner and I was crying, early in the morning, all by myself just with a blanket over my head not to show the other guys that I was nervous. And then James [Foley] came over to me, put his arm over my shoulders and said, \"Don't worry, they will probably come in 10 or 15 minutes, and you will be on your way home, and just enjoy it. You really earned your freedom.\"</p>\n<p><i>Subscribe to the </i><a href=\"https://ssl.bbc.co.uk/newsletters/newsmagazine?ptrt=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine\" class=\"story-body__link\">BBC News Magazine's email newsletter</a><i> to get articles sent to your inbox.</i></p>"

			"body": "\n<p class=\"story-body__introduction\">Singer Lily Allen has spoken out about her experience of being stalked by a stranger and her treatment by the police. It's not the first time a celebrity has received obsessive attention, but what are the stages that lead to somebody becoming a dangerous stalker?</p>\n<p>Lily Allen was relaxing in her flat last year when a stalker broke in and confronted her in her bedroom.</p>\n<p>\"I'm lying in bed and I can see the door handle moving and then he steams in, starts screaming and shouting... I could see he was really agitated and upset,\" she told the BBC's Newsnight.</p>\n<p>Alex Gray, from Perth, was charged and found guilty of harassment and burglary and is awaiting sentencing.  It was the culmination of an ordeal that started back in 2008 when Gray first contacted Allen on Twitter. Over time he began turning up at her house and office, left abusive notes and made suicide threats.</p>\n<p>Lily Allen is one of a long list of celebrities who have received persistent unwanted attention including singer Joss Stone and Little Mix's Jade Thirlwall. </p>\n<p>Television presenter and journalist Alexis Bowater has been stalked three separate times.</p>\n<p>\"It's extraordinarily psychologically damaging and traps you in an unwanted relationship with somebody that quite often you've never met and never want to meet. You're locked in a relationship with this perpetrator who's trying to control your life.\"</p>\n<p>But Alexis says super-fans and celebrity stalkers have little in common. While they may both have an intense interest in a particular celebrity, this is where the similarity ends.</p>\n<p>\"Stalkers frighten people and fans don't. There is a massive difference between meeting somebody and thinking 'she's quite nice and I'll send her some flowers' and approaching someone persistently doing that and making threats, pursuing and harassing them.\"</p>\n<p>Frank Farnham, consultant forensic psychiatrist at Barnet Enfield and Haringey Mental Health NHS Trust, agrees.</p>\n<p>\"Super-fans are relatively stable. They gain a lot from being in a group of people who like the same person. It's a pro-social behaviour. The super-fans know each other, they go to the same gigs together, they meet up and go for a drink,\" he says.</p>\n<p>\"With stalking, it's an anti-social behaviour. They think they have this special bond and this relationship with the celebrity and none of the other fans matter. When you're breaking into someone's bedroom, that's not the actions of a super-fan.\" </p>\n<p>It's a fundamentally different thing to start harassing people, says Dr Emma Short from Bedfordshire University. \"People with mental health problems who are vulnerable to delusions are the more likely to become stalkers,\" she says.</p>\n<p>\"The fixated celebrity stalker sees everything the celeb does in relationship to themselves. Everything has meaning. So if they are served with a cease and desist letter, they may think the celebrity is trying to contact them in code. </p>\n<p>\"The court process is complicated - for stalkers being in the same room as the celebrity can reinforce their feeling of attachment. Lily Allen spoke on Newsnight about how her stalker locked eyes with her. Being in the same room as her was very important to him.\"</p>\n<p>Celebrity stalkers get a huge amount of press, however they make up just a small part of those committing the criminal activity. Research from the Suzy Lamplugh Trust (which runs the National Stalking Helpline) has found one in five British women and one in 12 British men are victims of stalking during their lifetimes.</p>\n<p>Most celebrities don't know their stalkers, however in 90% of cases victims do know the person harassing them.</p>\n<p>Statistics from the National Stalking Helpline have revealed that 22% of stalkers are acquaintances of the victim, 5% worked or once worked with them, and 4% are family members. The largest group by far is ex-partners, who make up 45% of the total.</p>\n<p>Zoe Dronfield was stalked by a former partner who later attacked her. The mother-of-two from Coventry was left hospitalised with a bleed on her brain and a neck wound following an eight-hour attack. </p>\n<p>Zoe said she received calls, messages and emails and was harassed on social media after they broke up.</p>\n<p>\"There is a serious lack of understanding of stalking and the insidious behaviour behind it because certain incidents in isolation aren't frightening but when it gets to double figures and on a daily basis and you aren't able to function it's really frightening. You think 'what have I done to deserve this'?\"</p>\n<p>As classified by <a href=\"https://www.stalkingriskprofile.com/what-is-stalking/types-of-stalking\" class=\"story-body__link-external\">Australian academics</a> Paul Mullen, Michele Pathe and Rosemary Purcell.</p>\n<p>1: <strong>Rejected stalkers</strong> tend to be former sexual partners, who want to either reconcile or get revenge. They stalk because it allows the stalker to continue to feel close to the victim or allows them to salvage some self-esteem.</p>\n<p>2: <strong>Intimacy seeking stalkers</strong> suffer from loneliness and a lack of a confidante. Victims are usually strangers or acquaintances and the stalkers behaviour is often driven by mental health problems such as delusions. Celebrity stalkers often fall in to this category.</p>\n<p>3: <strong>Resentful stalkers</strong> feel they have been somehow mistreated by the victim and can arise from mental illness where the stalker develops paranoia. </p>\n<p>4: <strong>Predatory stalkers</strong> have deviant sexual interests. Stalking often starts as voyeurism for sexual gratification but can lead to sexual assault. </p>\n<p>5: <strong>Incompetent suitors</strong> want short-term sexual relationships. They usually stalk strangers or acquaintances for short periods. If they do persist they may be blind to the distress this causes and may have conditions that affect their social skills.</p>\n<p>Stalking is \"repeated, unwanted contact that occurs as a result of fixation or obsession and causes the victim(s) to feel distressed and fearful,\" according to the Suzy Lamplugh Trust.</p>\n<p>While the triggers for stalking can vary, the behaviour displayed follows a broadly similar pattern.</p>\n<p>\"It is common for stalking to escalate and get gradually worse over time. Stalkers are by nature obsessive and the longer they do it the more entrenched their fixation becomes,\" says Kristiana Rixon, from the trust.</p>\n<p>\"Stalking doesn't just affect the victim. A stalker typically contacts 21 people known to the victim including friends, family and neighbours. It's important that they don't engage with the stalker either as 5% of stalkers will assault someone known to the victim. Research shows 30 to 40% of victims are also physically assaulted.\"</p>\n<p>You should contact the police if you're being stalked - you have a right to feel safe in your home and workplace. Call 999 if you or someone else is in immediate danger otherwise contact your local police. </p>\n<p>Victims, whether they are celebrities or otherwise, experience a constant sense of dread and anxiety. </p>\n<p>\"I experienced what any other stalking victim would, which is hyper-vigilance,\" Alexis Bowater says.</p>\n<p>\"You know that an attack is imminent and inevitable but you just don't know where or when or who by.  You slowly change all of your behaviours, not all at once. Everything that you do is to make sure you and your family are safe. You spend your whole time expecting to be attacked at any moment.\"</p>\n<p>According to the Suzy Lamplugh Trust 80% of victims of stalking are women. Although women in their early 20s are slightly more likely to be stalked, age isn't a barrier. </p>\n<p>\"We've had cases from women in their 70s to women under the age of 18,\" says Rixon.</p>\n<p>Her advice on how to deal with stalkers is straightforward. </p>\n<p>\"If you are receiving unwanted attention tell them once. If they don't stop you shouldn't respond to them again as they will take this as an acknowledgement. I know this can be hard. You should also keep a record. You can also contact the National Stalking Helpline for advice and you can go to the police and make a report.\"</p>\n<p>The trust has argued that the police need to do more to support stalking victims. They have pointed to research that found only 26.6% of cases had been reported to the police and of those who made a report, 43% had not found the response helpful. </p>\n<p>Police action on stalking differs around the country. While Alexis says the police took her case \"very seriously\", Zoe said she was met with an unsympathetic response.  </p>\n<p>\"My experience of the police was when they first came round was 'you need to find yourself a nice boyfriend in future.' That's really not the attitude to be taking and it's quite an insult to your intelligence. It's exasperating. I felt helpless which is why I felt I had to manage the situation myself.\" </p>\n<p><i>Additional reporting by Jon Kelly</i></p>\n<p>What's it like to be stalked for a decade?

A large number of aftershocks followed, including one that measured 7.3 on 12 May 2015. Photographer Alison Baskerville travelled to Nepal with Handicap International UK to meet young people whose lives were changed forever by those events.</strong></p>\n<p>Uma Silwal (right) was at home with her family when the earthquake hit.  </p>\n<p>\"We were sitting having lunch and the ground started to shake,\" she says. \"At first we just froze, we had no idea what to do. Then we ran. I don't remember the wall landing on me. I just remember seeing everyone running ahead in front of me.\"  </p>\n<p>At the time of the earthquake Uma was studying engineering. Her father had just retired from a long career in the Nepalese Fire Service and was adjusting to life at home with a reduced income. </p>\n<p>\"I knew I had to get educated and find work so I could help support my family,\" Uma says.  </p>\n<p>The earthquake destroyed their home. As well as looking after her family, Uma's mother has been involved in rebuilding their house, and feeding the workers. </p>\n<p>\"My mother does so much,\" says Uma. \"Sometimes I worry that we take her for granted. She is the closest person to me and keeps our family together.\"  </p>\n<p>Uma later decided to change her degree to social work. \"I had a few choices ahead of me before the earthquake. It felt like with two legs I have two paths to take.  </p>\n<p>\"After the quake I only have one leg but it's also given me one clear path. To help those who are like me.\"</p>\n<p>Amrit Magar was sleeping in his room in the Pepsicola district of Kathmandu when the earthquake hit.  </p>\n<p>With both parents at work he was home alone and unsure what to do. He tried to run from the house but as he escaped the building collapsed and he was buried in rubble. </p>\n<p>Neighbours managed to pulled him free and he was taken to hospital.  </p>\n<p>\"When the wall fell I was unconscious. When I woke up I thought my legs were fine,\" he says. </p>\n<p>But Amrit remained in a fracture ward until the decision was made to remove one of his legs because it was so badly damaged.   </p>\n<p>\"I loved football before my accident but now I like to read and I want to go back to school,\" says Amrit. </p>\n<p>His father says they can no longer keep Amrit at home as they cannot afford the taxi fares for him to go to the local clinic.  </p>\n<p>Amrit's brother Amish (middle) spent four weeks by his side in hospital.</p>\n<p>His mother, Chandra Kala Magar, holds a family photograph that was recovered from the home. They now live in a temporary home built by the family's employer. </p>\n<p>Ramesh Khatri, then 18, was trapped under rubble for almost three days. When he was eventually pulled free he was rushed to the already overcrowded Bir hospital in Kathmandu. He kept his badly damaged legs for almost five days before doctors decided they should both be amputated.  </p>\n<p>\"I just had to accept this new life I have been given without my legs. It has not been easy but I'm really trying to start again and adapt to my new life,\" he says.</p>\n<p>Ramesh uses the walkway at the National Disability Fund clinic in Kathmandu to train on his prosthetics.  </p>\n<p>Although he has become highly skilled in his wheelchair, he is now focusing on his walking.  </p>\n<p>A few days after breaking his third wheelchair, Ramesh decided to take part in a 3km race in the city. </p>\n<p>With bloodied hands and sweat on his brow, Ramesh pushed himself to sixth place out of 21. \"Next year I'm going to win this race,\" he shouted as he received his finishing medal.</p>\n<p>\"He is ever the optimist,\" says Samrat Singh Basnet, the owner of the hostel where Ramesh lives. \"He's always there in the clinic, helping and encouraging people.\"</p>\n<p>\"I want to study first and then I want to be a social worker to help other people like me,\" says Ramesh. \"Whatever happened, happened. This is our future. We should start from here. We can start again even with our disability.\"</p>\n<p>Sandesh was on his lunch break at the Nepal Police School when the earth began to shake. Along with his classmates he fled from the room where they were.   </p>\n<p>But the outside wall collapsed on top of him, pinning him to the ground.  </p>\n<p>\"We were going to hide under the beds but then we decided to run,\" says Sandesh. \"Then the wall fell down on me. I was unconscious until I got to hospital.\"</p>\n<p>He too lost his legs because of the injuries he sustained. In hospital, he also received the terrible news that his best friend had been killed. </p>\n<p>After almost nine months at home Sandesh has now returned to the police school.  </p>\n<p>He is the only student with a disability and the school have tried their best to accommodate him. But there is a steep slope between the classrooms and accommodation blocks, which makes it difficult for Sandesh to move between the two areas. He stays in the classroom area throughout the school day. </p>\n<p>During his time in hospital he says he lost motivation and found it difficult to accept his condition. With help from therapists and fellow patient Ramesh, he was able to come to terms with his disability. </p>\n<p>He began using a wheelchair, later also using crutches, until he received his prosthetic legs. \"I thought I would never walk again,\" he says. \"When I stood up for the first time I was so happy.\"</p>\n<p class=\"story-body__introduction\">All photographs © Alison Baskerville / Handicap International</p>"

			"body": "\n<p class=\"story-body__introduction\">Mitsubishi Motors has admitted rigging data on some of its models' fuel efficiency. About 625,000 cars sold in Japan were affected, and the production of the relevant models has been halted. </p>\n<p>The inaccurate tests involved 157,000 of its own cars - the ek Wagon and eK Space - as well as 468,000 vehicles produced for Nissan - the Dayz and Dayz Roox.</p>\n<p>Car companies try to outdo each other on how fuel-efficient their models are. It impresses consumers because it's good for the environment, and it's easy on the wallet at the petrol station. </p>\n<p>Fuel efficiency is tested by putting cars on what is essentially a treadmill where they run at a certain speed and fuel consumption is measured. </p>\n<p>Mitsubishi appears to have overinflated the tyres, which gave better results on the fuel efficiency test.</p>\n<p>Imagine inflating your bicycle tyres to the maximum and going up a hill, then letting half the air out and going up the same hill again. It's much harder. The extra muscle you need gives you an idea of the extra fuel that a car would burn through. </p>\n<p>The controversy comes hard on the heels of the Volkswagen emissions scandal but is slightly different. </p>\n<p>Volkswagen installed hidden software in its diesel models that detected when an official emissions test was being conducted. The software would then lower the emission so the test readings were more favourable. </p>\n<p>So VW rigged the level of harmful gases coming from the exhaust pipe to make their cars look greener than they were. </p>\n<p>Mitsubishi rigged the fuel consumption readings so their cars would appear to use less fuel than they actually did. </p>\n<p>Mitsubishi is a somewhat confusing brand. There are a whole host of independent companies that share the name and trace their origins back to the original Mitsubishi company founded in 1870 in the shipping industry. </p>\n<p>The current companies though are entirely independent from each other. </p>\n<p>That means you will find the name in aviation, banking, air conditioners, the nuclear and chemical industry, optics and of course, cars. </p>\n<p>Mitsubishi Motors is the sixth biggest car maker in Japan and number 16 worldwide. </p>\n<p>Large-scale production got under way in the 1960s. In 1977 the company entered the European market and in 1982 the US market. Annual car production currently stands at 1,218,853 vehicles. </p>\n<p>The current scandal is at Mitsubishi Motors. Any damage to the brand name though, might spill over to the other companies. </p>\n<p>It's not the first time that Mitsubishi Motors has been in the headlines for misconduct. </p>\n<p>In the early 2000s, the company had to admit to lying about defects in its cars for decades.</p>\n<p>Back then, an internal investigation found that the firm had covered up faults since 1977 and repaired cars secretly, instead of reporting the problems to the transport ministry. </p>\n<p>The cover-up led to huge recalls, criminal charges against several employees and a cost of billions to the company. </p>"

He appeared to know what was coming next.</p>\n<p>\"Because of the way this child was behaving, I went and checked on the DfE website and I found this exact test published as a sample paper.</p>\n<p>She said the DfE finally admitted the error after a number of telephone calls.</p>\n<p>Officials have now removed the sample paper from the website and checked no other paper has been affected. </p>\n<p>A DfE spokesman said it was \"deeply regrettable it had happened\" but stressed the results of this test were not collected nationally but kept within schools to inform teacher assessments..</p>\n<p>\"Fortunately, this is a Key Stage 1 test which is provided to schools to support teacher assessment judgements.</p>\n<p>\"We ask if anyone has seen the material that they do not share it further so the test remains helpful for those teachers who have to yet use it with their pupils.\"</p>\n<p>National Union of Teachers general secretary Christine Blower said primary assessment was plainly in a mess.</p>\n<p>Shadow education secretary Lucy Powell said the incompetence of ministers was \"breathtaking\".</p>\n<p>\"To publish upcoming test papers online, before children have had a chance to sit them, renders the whole process null and void,\" she added.</p>\n<p>Key Stage 1 <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/507259/Informationforparents_2016nationalcurriculumtestsattheendofkeystages_1and2_PDFA.pdf\" class=\"story-body__link-external\">Sats</a> tests are taken by six- and seven-year-olds in England at the end of Year Two. </p>\n<p>Pupils take tests in: </p>\n<p>The Key Stage 1 test results are used by teachers to reach an overall judgement of the standards pupils have reached in these key subjects. </p>\n<p>Parents also receive a teacher assessment for science, though there is no science test. </p>\n<p>A second set of tests, Key Stage 2 Sats, are taken by 10- and 11-year-olds at the end of Year Six. </p>\n<p>The Key Stage 2 tests are used as a measure of school performance. </p>\n<p>This year's Key Stage 2 tests will be more demanding than in previous years and will be based on the new curriculum taught in England since 2014. </p>\n<p>Pupils will sit them on set dates in the second week in May. </p>\n<p>They include: </p>"

			"body": "\n<p class=\"story-body__introduction\">In St Clair County, Illinois, the local prosecutor is trying a radical new experiment: admitting his office has charged innocent people with crimes and clearing their names before they spend a day in prison. It's a unique reform effort as prosecutors around the country face increased scrutiny and diminishing public trust.</p>\n<p>Lashonda Moreland's day had barely begun when the pounding on the front door began. Her husband had already left for work, and she was home with her two children in their second storey apartment in a suburb of St Louis, Missouri. </p>\n<p>When a voice barked through the door, Moreland realised the figures outside were police officers. </p>\n<p>\"He said, 'You need to open up the door or we're going to kick it down,'\" she recalls. \"My kids are scared and they're crying...I'm upset and I start crying.\"</p>\n<p>The police arrested Moreland - a 30-year-old home healthcare worker with no criminal history - and she spent the next several days in various jails until she was transferred over the river to St Clair County, Illinois.</p>\n<p>\"It was scary because I had never been in jail. I never had to be on lockdown,\" she says. \"I literally cried every day. I was trying to wrap my mind around, 'Why am I in here?'\"</p>\n<p>Moreland was accused of shoplifting, evading police and for trying to run down a police officer with her car. </p>\n<p>Several months prior to her arrest, a young couple walked into an Old Navy store in a strip mall in Fairview Heights, Illinois. They shoveled little girls' coats, jeans and pants into bags, some still attached to their hangers, then walked out and got into a maroon Buick LeSabre with nearly $700 (£495) worth of stolen merchandise. A security guard called the police.</p>\n<p>The responding officers from the Fairview Heights Police Department quickly located the car at a traffic signal, and an officer named Drew Rutter got out of his patrol vehicle and approached the driver's side of the Buick on foot.</p>\n<p>\"The driver and I made eye contact, and I observed her grasp the steering wheel,\" Rutter later wrote in his report. \"Fearing for my life and the safety of others in the area, I immediately drew my department issued duty weapon.\"</p>\n<p>The car lurched past him and another officer, missing Rutter's legs by \"inches\", and disappeared down the highway.</p>\n<p>All the police had was the licence plate number, which was registered to Lashonda Moreland's address. When Officer Rutter looked at Moreland's driver's licence photo, he immediately identified her as the woman who had tried to run him over. </p>\n<p>Moreland didn't own a Buick, nor did she do her shopping 30 minutes away in a completely different state. She did, however, have a cousin who had registered his maroon Buick LeSabre to her address without telling her. She explained all this to the Fairview Heights police when they first contacted her after the incident, but they didn't believe her.</p>\n<p>Things looked bad for Moreland. She couldn't prove her alibi and the witness who placed her at the scene was an officer of the law. She was facing up to 11 years in prison. </p>\n<p>Instead of getting dragged through a jury trial, something surprising happened. Moreland's lawyer Kristi Flint told the St Clair County state's attorney office that her client was innocent. In response, the prosecutor offered Moreland the chance to take a polygraph test. Flint nervously agreed, and Moreland passed. Six months after her arrest, the charges were dropped. Everyone, including the Fairview Heights police department, agrees that Moreland is innocent. </p>\n<p>Moreland did not know it at the time, but she was the beneficiary of a new programme created by St Clair County State's Attorney Brendan Kelly: the Actual Innocence Claim Policy and Protocol. It is a unique, pre-conviction intervention which attempts to prevent the \"actually innocent\" from going through a trial, taking a plea deal, or ending up in prison.</p>\n<p>Actual innocence is a legal concept which means, simply, that a defendant did not commit the crime of which he or she is accused. It is usually invoked when a prison inmate is attempting to appeal his sentence, but Kelly wanted to bring the spirit of the concept to the pre-conviction level. </p>\n<p>\"That's distinct from 'I didn't get treated fairly',\" says Kelly, a Navy veteran who became the county's top law enforcement officer in 2010 when he was only 34 years old. \"It's not, 'Some of the evidence was obtained unlawfully, there was an incorrect ruling by the court, on the trial level some error by the defense' - no, you actually have the wrong person here...they're actually innocent.\"</p>\n<p>Since Kelly implemented the policy two years ago, nine defendants - including Lashonda Moreland - have had their charges dropped before trial. Those cases include a reckless homicide by vehicle, four armed robberies and one murder. </p>\n<p>To the best of his knowledge, no other prosecutor in the country is attempting anything quite like it. Even the US Department of Justice has taken an interest in what is happening in St Clair County.</p>\n<p>\"I think it is a nightmare scenario for any prosecutor or any police officer to have investigated and prosecuted and convicted the wrong person,\" says Kelly. \"That strikes at our very sense of what our job is all about, which is to seek justice.\"</p>\n<p>There is an increasing body of evidence that suggests that local prosecutors had an enormous hand in the explosion of the US prison population. </p>\n<p>Theirs is an incredibly powerful position in the American criminal justice system, though the job is not well understood by the general public. Popular works of true crime journalism like Netflix's Making a Murderer and the podcast Serial are beginning to change that, and cast the prosecutors in each case in a fairly villainous light.</p>\n<p>\"Between 1994 and 2008, the main cause of rising prison populations is DAs [district attorneys] filing felony cases. This seems to be true across the United States,\" says John Pfaff, a professor at Fordham Law School.  \"DAs have kind of managed to avoid a lot of attention for a long time.\"</p>\n<p>Simply put, prosecutors decide what crimes to charge defendants with. A single crime can have a smorgasbord of potential charging options for prosecutors, ones that can come with short or extremely long mandatory minimum sentences. In the \"tough on crime\" era of the late 1990s, prosecutors started bringing harsher charges more often. Since the vast majority of cases settle with a plea deal, those charges and their sentences stick, meaning prosecutors essentially dictate how much time a person will serve. Only a tiny number of defendants go to trial to challenge the prosecutor. </p>\n<p>\"District attorneys have almost unfettered discretion on who to charge and who not to charge,\" says Pfaff. \"There's almost no judicial review of what kind of charges you choose, as long as the facts are there to back them up.\"</p>\n<p>The introduction of DNA evidence was a game changer in terms of public awareness of the choices prosecutors make. Suddenly, inmates who'd served decades in prison or been sentenced to the death were able to prove they were innocent. There have been<a href=\"http://www.law.umich.edu/special/exoneration/Pages/about.aspx\" class=\"story-body__link-external\"> 1,773 exonerations in the US</a> since 1989. </p>\n<p>This has shone a new light on hard-charging prosecutors who fought for the convictions in the first place, and then sometimes opposed the inmates' bid for freedom, even after DNA evidence contradicted their theory of the crime.</p>\n<p>\"I think because of some of the professional incentives to get convictions and maintain convictions, and political incentives to be tough on crime, the justice role takes a back seat to the advocacy role,\" says Northeastern University law professor Daniel Medwed, author of Prosecution Complex: America's Race to Convict and Its Impact on the Innocent. </p>\n<p>\"It's a little bit of human nature. Once you've made a decision to do something, it often takes a lot of countervailing evidence to get them to change their minds.\"</p>\n<p>But not all prosecutors have buried their heads in the sand when it comes to cases of actual innocence. In the last five years, the number of prosecutors who created so-called <a href=\"http://www.law.umich.edu/special/exoneration/Documents/Exonerations_in_2015.pdf\" class=\"story-body__link-external\">\"conviction integrity units\"</a>, or \"a division of a prosecutorial office that works to prevent, identify and correct false convictions\", have quadrupled. Some have set up screening committees to vet certain types of cases, like a prosecutor in New York state who decided that any case that relied on single eyewitness identification automatically warrants special attention.</p>\n<p>However, most remedies become available after defendants have already spent a significant amount of time behind bars. That was the conclusion of Jim Piper, first assistant state's attorney for St Clair County, when he found himself listening to a radio story about the highly lauded conviction integrity unit in Brooklyn, New York, while getting the oil in his car changed one day in 2013.</p>\n<p>\"So many cases had been overturned where young men had been sitting in jail for years and years before someone got around to vetting the prosecution,\" he recalls. \"It occurred to me - why are we doing that at the end? Why don't we have a procedure in place on the front end to vet prosecutions before they can become a conviction?\"</p>\n<p>St Clair County is an interesting laboratory for such an experiment. A county with a population of about 280,000, it encompasses the city of East St Louis, which at one time led the nation with its murder rate and has struggled since the 1970s with joblessness, drugs and violent crime. There are 32 arresting agencies of all sizes within the county - from a single part-time officer in Summerfield to the 1,700-officer Illinois State Police - who police everything from the urban industrial riverfront on the western border to the corn fields on the eastern edge. It has its share of official corruption. Kelly has charged 13 police officers in the county with various crimes, everything from theft of evidence to battering a suspect to forcing a woman to perform oral sex at a traffic stop.</p>\n<p>\"We have every kind of case you can think of,\" says Kelly, who grew up in the area.</p>\n<p>Around the time that Piper was getting that fateful oil change, the St Clair County state's attorney had three cases on his plate where defence lawyers genuinely believed their clients could be innocent. This is an anomaly - typically, defendants will challenge evidence, or request a lesser charge, but few claim to be actually innocent.</p>\n<p>In response, Kelly and Piper authored a simple protocol: If a defendant, their counsel or anyone else associated with the case brought forward compelling reasons to believe that the defendant was innocent, the defendant would be allowed to take a polygraph or a voice-stress test. Piper says that though they know these kinds of tests can be unreliable, being confronted with the chance to take one can filter out disingenuous defendants. Regardless of the results of the test - which are inadmissible at trial due to issues with the reliability of the technology - the assistant state's attorney (ASA) in charge of the case would also perform a \"de novo\" or \"from the beginning\" review of all the evidence. </p>\n<p>\"The ASA shall confirm that no other probative forensic testing can be conducted and that no other witnesses can be identified and interviewed,\" the protocol reads. \"At the end of this review, if both the ASA and supervising ASA(s) either no longer believe there exists a moral certainty of the defendant's guilt or believe there no longer exists a reasonable likelihood of conviction, then the case shall be dismissed without prejudice.\" </p>\n<p>One of the first tests of the programme was a murder case. Rodney Lewis admitted he stabbed 18-year-old Michael Barton Jr, but always maintained that it was in self defence. He passed his polygraph, and after re-examining the evidence, the assistant state's attorney dropped the charges. After 414 days in the St Clair County jail, he went home. </p>\n<p>\"I think it was his mother who went and picked him up,\" says Lewis' lawyer, Thomas Keefe III. \"She was very, very happy.\"</p>\n<p>Each of the nine cases has a different set of circumstances that led to charges being filed and ultimately dropped. Eyewitnesses identified the wrong perpetrators. Co-defendants implicated friends or acquaintances who were never there. In one case of an armed robbery of a mobile phone, the defendant falsely confessed after he says he was pressured by investigators. </p>\n<p>\"I thought I was going to jail anyway, so, I just said I did it,\" <a href=\"http://www.bnd.com/news/local/article55051595.html\" class=\"story-body__link-external\">he told the Belleville-News Democrat</a>, which broke the news of the programme. \"But I didn't know anything about it.\"</p>\n<p>So far, Kelly says just one claim that was investigated under the protocol actually yielded more evidence of the defendants' guilt, bolstering the state's case - a natural check, he believes, on the programme being abused.</p>\n<p>Some have pointed out that vetting cases before trial is a basic tenet of the work of a prosecutor, that Kelly's protocol just codifies what he is supposed to be doing anyway. If that's the case, the revolutionary step seems to be a simple willingness to publicly admit defendants were charged erroneously.</p>\n<p>\"I was honestly kind of surprised that they came forward and said, 'We dumped these [cases] because of actual innocence,'\" says Cathy MacElroy, a defence lawyer who has had two clients exonerated under the protocol.</p>\n<p>Kelly claims there have been no complaints from police about the programme, and he wants people to know that even though officers may initially arrest the wrong person, it is good police work that can correct an error as well.</p>\n<p>\"It's an imperfect world. We have good people in law enforcement and good people in the criminal justice system and good people as witnesses, but they can all make mistakes.\"</p>\n<p>In 19-year-old Brandon Jackson's case, it was the work of defence lawyers that ultimately cleared him. Another teenager implicated Jackson in a plot to lure a tattoo artist who made house calls to an abandoned home, and rob him of his money and equipment. When two of the perpetrators eventually took plea deals, they independently admitted that Jackson had nothing to do with the robbery.</p>\n<p>Still, Jackson - and other wrongfully charged individuals - has a hard time feeling grateful. He was 17 at the time of his arrest, and after spending months both in a juvenile detention centre then on house arrest, he couldn't graduate from high school. Now he lives at home with his mother and works in a warehouse. </p>\n<p>\"It was very stressful when I was locked up. I didn't know when I was coming home. When you get arrested for nothing, you don't know what is going on. Then they're offering you years of your life for nothing,\" he says. \"It took a whole year off my life.\"</p>\n<p><strong>More from the BBC on US criminal justice</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24119398\" class=\"story-body__link\">Why does Wisconsin send so many black people to jail?</a> - The state that locks up the highest percentage of black men</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-34705968\" class=\"story-body__link\">The US inmates charged per night in jail</a> - Reversing a widespread practice known as \"pay to stay\"</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-33681160\" class=\"story-body__link\">Why is it so hard to hire black police officers?</a> - One department's effort to diversify</p>\n<p>Then there's the fact that he had to pay the county $5 per day while he was on an ankle monitor, plus the cost of a landline to carry the monitor's signal. For his mother Ommie, a double amputee who lives on a fixed income, these were not trivial expenses, nor was hiring a private attorney. She says they're still paying their legal bill in instalments. </p>\n<p>Detavius McGary, who was accused of and then exonerated of charges that he robbed an elderly woman at gunpoint, spent 75 days in jail, then also had to pay a per diem fee for a year of ankle monitoring. His mother says she knows her son was lucky to have the chance to prove his innocence, but that she is now \"completely broke\". McGary says he wanted to sue the county but can't find a lawyer to take the case. And there were other costs.</p>\n<p>\"When they had me, I couldn't really see my kids,\" McGary says. \"I had so many good job opportunities, [but] then people, they weren't accepting me because of the case. I ain't really all the way recovered.\"</p>\n<p>Moreland's landlord attempted to evict her family over the arrest, until her defence lawyer Kristi Flint wrote a letter explaining the situation. Flint says that clients like Moreland are lucky that they could afford to bond out - a more indigent client who is actually innocent might have just pleaded guilty in order to get out of jail. Six of the nine defendants spent over a month in jail - the longest was Lewis' 414 days.</p>\n<p>\"I think that it is admirable that Brendan has put this out here as, 'Yes, innocent people get charged and when they do, you know, we dismiss it,'\" says Flint. \"But my question is, OK, so what do we do after this? What is he doing with this information? Lashonda is out money, the stresses that she went through - there's no making her whole.\"</p>\n<p>In his cluttered office on the second floor of the St Clair County courthouse - a map of East St Louis with violent crimes, usually gun violence, marked with red stickers in one corner - Kelly admits that his protocol is an experiment, one he can't guarantee will be successful. </p>\n<p>\"I think we're going to review it every year and just see how it's going. The public defenders, the prosecutors are in the trenches every day and we get continuous feedback,\" he says.</p>\n<p>Currently, the St Clair County state's attorney's office is looking at two new possible cases of actual innocence - this time cases of alleged sexual abuse of a child. </p>\n<p>Kelly does not think being open to admitting law enforcement mistakes makes him soft on crime. He considers himself an \"aggressive\" prosecutor who believes in law enforcement and its role in bringing about the precipitous decline in crime in the US since the 1990s. In his first year in office, he doubled the number of charges filed, though he sent many of those cases to drug and mental health courts. It's a line he says he walks because he believes there is no \"criminal justice without social justice\".</p>\n<p>\"Your local DA is accountable not to some person who appointed them in DC, or some state capitol somewhere, but is accountable to the people that they serve,\" he says. \"I think the prosecutor has the ability to be uniquely part of the solution, because again, we're the one entity whose duty is first and foremost to justice.\"</p>\n<p><i>Subscribe to the </i><a href=\"https://ssl.bbc.co.uk/newsletters/newsmagazine?ptrt=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine\" class=\"story-body__link\">BBC News Magazine's email newsletter</a><i> to get articles sent to your inbox. </i></p>"

Unveiling a plaque, meeting flag-waving members of the public on a walkabout, being presented with a bouquet of flowers - these are things she has done thousands of times. But the crowds weren't going to let her forget that this day, her 90th birthday, was something out of the ordinary. </p>\n<p>Some had been waiting for hours - some for days - to catch a glimpse of the Queen on the day she became the nation's first-ever nonagenarian monarch. </p>\n<p>As the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh walked the short distance from Windsor Castle, a spontaneous rendition of Happy Birthday rang out - and it wouldn't be the last. </p>\n<p>One woman who has lived nearly as long as the Queen summed up the atmosphere.

			"body": "\n<p class=\"story-body__introduction\">Australian federal MP Dennis Jensen is not the first politician to produce a racy thriller. One-time British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd has penned some breathless prose, as has the former Queensland Premier Peter Beattie. </p>\n<p>Dr Jensen, though, may be the first to lose his job, as he sees it, over a novel containing one steamy sex scene.</p>\n<p>A conservative Liberal Party backbencher, Dr Jensen is an outspoken opponent of same-sex marriage and a climate change sceptic. He boycotted the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/7241965.stm\" class=\"story-body__link\">2008 apology</a> to the Stolen Generations, and sparked outrage recently when he said taxpayers should not be funding the \"noble savage\" lifestyles of remote Aboriginal communities.</p>\n<p>His views endeared him to a group of powerbrokers from the party's evangelical Christian wing, whose support he was counting on to help him contest his Perth seat of Tangney at a federal election due later this year.</p>\n<p>However, when local Liberals met earlier this month to choose a candidate for Tangney, the MP was cast aside - by a humiliating 57 to seven votes - in favour of Ben Morton, the party's former state director. </p>\n<p>An angry Dr Jensen blamed a \"smear campaign\", allegedly mounted in collusion with The Australian, which days earlier had <a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/mp-dennis-jensen-used-official-stationery-to-spruik-his-novel/news-story/13b83249b32296ddd8027921ef11f447\" class=\"story-body__link-external\">revealed the existence of his book</a>, The Skywarriors, about an imaginary war between Australia and an Indonesian regime briefly backed by China.</p>\n<p>The newspaper reported that the 54-year-old used his parliamentary letterhead when writing to a Sydney literary agent in 2007 seeking a publishing deal. </p>\n<p>It also reproduced a scene from his book following the downing of an Australian warplane in the Indian Ocean. A fictional Indonesian dictator, Rajiv Rono, tells his mistress, Yasmine, that \"those arrogant Australians won't know what has hit them!\" He then rips off her blouse, \"completely ignoring her protests\", and enjoys \"the fruits of his victory\". </p>\n<p>The story was enthusiastically picked up by the rest of the Australian media. Then came a second article in which The Australian reported that Dr Jensen had \"recently left the family home... to live about 60km away [outside Tangney] with his new girlfriend\".</p>\n<p>\"It was a one-two shot against me,\" Dr Jensen told the BBC. </p>\n<p>\"One, he's a purveyor of smut. Two, he's abandoned his wife and kids to shack up with his new girlfriend. This was a very well organised, well co-ordinated strike, aimed with laser precision at my religious supporters, and it was quite effective in scaring them off.</p>\n<p>\"In fact, my wife left me in July 2014. She lived in the electorate home. I lived down at our holiday home. I met my current girlfriend, and we've been together subsequently, in November 2014. So none of that stuff was current.\"</p>\n<p>How does the sex scene in Dennis Jensen's The Skywarriors stack up against raunchy writing from politicians across the world? </p>\n<p>\"Flushed with the excitement of the moment, Rono felt that he just had to relieve himself. He violently pulled Yasmine's blouse buttons apart, completely ignoring her protests. Yasmine didn't believe in wearing bras; in fact, she didn't really need to\" - Dennis Jensen in The Skywarriors.</p>\n<p>\"She gently picked up his hand and guided it to their ecstasy\" - former Queensland Premier Peter Beattie in The Year of the Dangerous Ones.</p>\n<p>\"The din from the party mocked me as Karen attacked my surly worm with gusto\" - Australian Labor Party MP Graham Perrett in The Twelfth Fish.</p>\n<p>\"Suddenly the pouting sex kitten gave way to Diana the Huntress. She rolled onto him and somehow was sitting athwart his chest, her knees pinning his shoulders. 'Tell me, or I will make you do terrible things,' she hissed\" - Former US Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich in 1945.</p>\n<p>\"On that night of 12 May 1994, I needed that love Cherie gave me, selfishly. I devoured it to give me strength. I was an animal following my instinct\" - Tony Blair in his autobiography, A Journey.</p>\n<p>Dr Jensen is now suing The Australian for defamation - an action which prompted one columnist to hail him as \"that rarest of unpublished authors, who sues a publisher for publishing material, the publication of which he had previously actively sought\". </p>\n<p>In another paradoxical move last week, the MP self-published a Kindle edition of The Skywarriors, meaning that a work subject to a defamation claim is now available on Amazon for anyone with a spare A$6.51 ($5.07; £3.54).</p>\n<p>Even at that price, readers expecting a raunchy read may well feel cheated. The book contains just one sex scene: the 154-word, toe-curling encounter already reprinted by multiple news outlets. When two fighter pilots subsequently get together, we learn only of their \"voyage of gentle and passionate discovery\". </p>\n<p>And apart from mention of an Australian oil worker engrossed in Penthouse just before his rig is attacked by Indonesia off the Kimberley coast, that is it.</p>\n<p>Instead, the novel serves up page upon page of technical detail about combat aircraft and radar systems, along with characters such as Australian pilot Jenny Peters, whose athletic physique indicates she is \"unlikely to have weight problems later in life\" and whose \"shapely calves need no assistance from any stocking\".</p>\n<p>A former submarine operations researcher with the federal government's Defence Science and Technology Organisation (now Group), Dr Jensen calls The Skywarriors - which he wrote in 2002, two years before entering parliament - a techno-thriller, after the genre pioneered by Tom Clancy. </p>\n<p>The MP's father, who is a journalist and author, advised him that every book needs at least one passage of graphic sex to get published, he says. However, after completing The Skywarriors, Dr Jensen - a member of the joint standing parliamentary committee on foreign affairs, defence and trade - decided not to pursue his quest for a publisher, fearing that it might harm Australia's relations with Indonesia and China.</p>\n<p>So why self-publish it now? </p>\n<p>\"The plot is out in the public domain now, so the damage is done. And I thought I might have a shot at seeing if it would sell. Also to put the record straight and show it's not a work of erotica, as The Australian portrayed it.\"</p>\n<p>Dr Jensen, who has held the safe Liberal seat for nearly 12 years, insists the candidate selection battle was \"on a knife edge\" until the negative articles appeared. </p>\n<p>In truth, despite him winning record majorities, he has never been popular with local Liberals, who tried to dump him in 2006 and again in 2009. The first time, then Prime Minister John Howard intervened; the second, the party's state council stepped in. This time, it seems that there is no-one willing to save him. </p>\n<p>Now Dr Jensen is \"done with\" the Liberal Party, whose MPs are expected to confine themselves to \"branch stacking, fundraising and brainless conformity\", he claims. And while he is considering standing as an independent, he believes the recent publicity has probably ruined his chances.</p>\n<p>Does an alternative career as a fiction writer appeal? </p>\n<p>\"It would, but I know it's extremely difficult to make a living. For every Wilbur Smith you've got thousands that haven't made a penny or certainly not enough to support themselves.\" </p>"

But what is it like to play one of the most famous faces in the world - and what makes so many want to do so? </p>\n<p>Playing the Queen could be daunting for many actresses. But two who have done exactly that on stage say there is one crucial element for getting into character - the wig.</p>\n<p>Emma Handy played Liz - the 1980s version of the Queen - in the recent touring production of Moira Buffini play Handbagged, which imagines older and younger versions of the Queen and Margaret Thatcher in conversation during their weekly audience. </p>\n<p>\"The wig and make-up and clothes do so much,\" she says. \"It's extraordinary.\" </p>\n<p>But, adds Handy: \"She seems to have two faces - the public and the private face. There is very little footage of her private life, but she is known to be enormously mischievous - and these are things I have in common with her.\"   </p>\n<p>One thing Handy was adamant about was not doing an impersonation of the Queen - instead she focused on capturing her \"essence\". She says she found sitting \"incredibly straight-backed\" helped. </p>\n<p>\"She's probably the most photographed person in the world, so everyone has an idea of her,\" says Handy. </p>\n<p>\"Every year you see the Christmas broadcast, but that's not who she is. There is a massive side of her people don't know.\"</p>\n<p>Marion Bailey, who played Q - the older Queen - in the West End production, says: \"It is irresistible to play the Queen. When I was cast, I mentioned it to a few people and someone said I didn't look anything like the Queen. </p>\n<p>\"And I replied: 'Oh, but I do,'\". I've often sat in make-up chairs and had my hair in a particular way, looked in the mirror and thought: 'You know what? I could do the Queen,'.\"</p>\n<p>In preparation for the London run of the play, initially at the Tricycle Theatre before transferring to the Vaudeville Theatre, she says she watched all the Queen's Christmas messages - as well as anything else she could find online. </p>\n<p>And the reaction was everything she could have hoped for. </p>\n<p>\"Some nights I would walk out and there would be gasps,\" she says. \"It was to do with the look of it and the history, and I tried to get as many of the mannerisms as I could. On the West End transfer, I heard an American tourist whisper: 'Is that the Queen?'.\"  </p>\n<p>Prof Philip Murphy, director of the Institute of Commonwealth Studies at the University of London, says the closest the public ever got to seeing the real Queen was in the 1969 documentary Royal Family.</p>\n<p>But Prof Murphy says: \"The Royal Family effectively suppressed it. They decided it reduced the mystique around them. </p>\n<p>\"In a way, that creates a carte blanche for writers and satirists to make up personalities.\"</p>\n<p>He adds: \"That's the problem the Royal Family has - they want to appear human but they also want to appear somehow removed and keep this dignified distance.\"</p>\n<p>One issue with writing about the Queen is that \"fact and fiction gets mixed up\", he says. </p>\n<p>\"The public have very little sense of what actually goes on. But a plausible fictional representation can almost seep into historical record.\"</p>\n<p>Portrayals of the Queen have not always been the most flattering, he notes.</p>\n<p>\"Spitting Image was an attack on British deference around authority figures - and there were no more esteemed than the Royal Family,\" says the professor.  </p>\n<p>One of the lead writers of that series was author John O'Farrell, who says: \"If you cast your mind back to the 1980s, there was an enormous reverential style. It was seen as poor form to laugh at the Queen's expense... But what we did was show her to be an ordinary person in an ordinary family, which is where it struck a comic nerve,\" he says.</p>\n<p>He adds: \"The tabloids faked outrage, but people loved it... At times it was crude and disrespectful - but I think that's warranted.\"</p>\n<p>Alison Jackson is someone else whose work has attracted controversy. Her apparently candid photographs of celebrities in private moments are created with the help of carefully-chosen lookalikes. </p>\n<p>Thanks to Jackson, we see \"the Queen\" putting out dog food for her corgis, taking a selfie and doing the washing-up. </p>\n<p>\"I thought it would be really good to get her doing normal things,\" says Jackson. </p>\n<p>\"She is a person, after all. And she does do normal things - she reads, she drives a Land Rover, she gets her hands dirty - she's quite tomboyish, really. She's not a diva and seems to come across as a normal woman, even though of course she's not.\"</p>\n<p>Jackson says one photograph seems to be seen as going too far, however. </p>\n<p>\"My photograph of the Queen on the loo is my least published. I don't think it's been seen in any newspaper in England, whereas a lot of other works get published all the time,\" she says.</p>\n<p>\"People think breaking that taboo is tasteless, which I find interesting. But it's designed to be thought-provoking, rather than controversial.\"</p>\n<p>Thought provoking as they may be, perhaps fictional representations get us no closer to who the Queen actually is - barring of course the only time she has played herself, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/xW5abat5NEU\" class=\"story-body__link-external\">acting alongside Daniel Craig in a James Bond sketch</a> for the London Olympics opening ceremony in 2012. </p>\n<p>But that certainly isn't going to stop people from continuing to try to capture the essence of this elusive, yet ever-present, figure. </p>"

			"date_published": 1461194904,
			"body": "\n<p class=\"story-body__introduction\">A record number of people have applied to join the French police force over the past year. Many new recruits say the recent attacks in Paris inspired them to sign up. It also seems that the shootings have made the country rethink its attitude towards the police.</p>\n<p>A young recruit pushes away a woman charging at her with a club. The recruit draws her revolver. \"Police! Don't move!\" she yells. </p>\n<p>Audrey is taking part in a self-defence class at the police training school in Sens, eastern France, having signed up after gunmen attacked the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo and a Jewish supermarket at the start of 2015.  </p>\n<p>\"Since the [Paris] terror attacks in January and November last year, the danger confronting us is clear,\" she says. \"Any one of us can be a victim. Every one of us needs protection. And we all want to help somehow. That's why I'm here. To help make this country safer.\" </p>\n<p>In March this year, a record 35,000 people sat the exam to join the police - 50% more than last year. </p>\n<p>Only 8% of those who took the test passed - the same success level as for the entrance exam for the elite Science-Po political science school in Paris.  </p>\n<p>\"I was really shocked by the video from the Charlie Hebdo killings of the policeman who was on the ground, asking for mercy, who they shot in cold blood,\" says another recruit, Perez, when I ask him why he joined the police.  </p>\n<p>\"That made me want to defend our republic, defend our nation even more. In the morning we'll wake up and know that maybe today we'll risk our lives but we're more motivated than ever,\" he says.  </p>\n<p>The policeman Perez is talking about was called Ahmed Merabet, and the next recruit I talk to shares the same first name. </p>\n<p>\"I'm of Algerian origin,\" he says. \"We had a lot of terrorism in Algeria when I was growing up. I remember the curfews when we went there on holiday. When the Bataclan happened in November I remembered Algeria, and in December I joined the police.\"</p>\n<p>Three of the victims in the Charlie Hebdo and kosher supermarket attacks were police officers, and the live TV coverage of their colleagues storming the shop to save hostages led many to see them as heroes.  </p>\n<p>Then, in November, the first man to confront the attackers inside the Bataclan concert hall in Paris was an off-duty police officer who happened to be passing. He entered the building and shot one of the gunmen dead with his service revolver. A few days later police stormed a flat in St Denis, just north of the city, killing the suspected ringleader. </p>\n<p>\"The terror attacks are a decisive factor for many in our new intake,\" says the director of the training college, Jacques Richard.</p>\n<p>\"I think these young people are discovering a sense of duty and the desire to help their fellow human beings.</p>\n<p>\"When something like this happens, people pull together. Everyone wants to make their own contribution. There's been a big increase in the number of people volunteering to give blood, for example. And more people have wanted to join the emergency services and the police. It's had a big influence on the way people think.\" </p>\n<p>The image of the police in France has changed significantly over the past 20 years. The 1995 film <i>La Haine</i>, a hit both at the box-office and with the critics, portrayed the police as sadistic and racist. </p>\n<p>\"It's an anti-police film,\" explained Mathieu Kassovitz, who won the best director prize for the movie at Cannes that year. When the cast climbed the famous festival steps, the police on duty there turned their backs in protest.</p>\n<p>The police have had an extremely negative image in France for centuries, says historian Jean-Marc Berliere, who's written several books about them.  </p>\n<p>\"Even in Louis XIV's time the people loathed the police,\" he says. \"In the public imagination the police meant repression and the limitation of freedom.\" </p>\n<p>A defining moment was May 1968 when police and rioting students fought pitched battles around Paris's Sorbonne University. That revolutionary movement spread to workers bringing the French economy to a virtual standstill for two weeks. Violence erupted when President Charles de Gaulle tried to sort things out by sending in the police. </p>\n<p>But the media always had a soft-spot for the paving-stone-hurling students.  </p>\n<p>But four days after the Charlie Hebdo massacre, something extraordinary happened. People filled the streets of Paris to show their sympathy for the the victims and demonstrate their support for the police. A <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duCIpdE-Q6I&amp;list=RDduCIpdE-Q6I\" class=\"story-body__link-external\">video posted on YouTube</a> captures the moment. </p>\n<p>The crowd parts. There are women running - some of them laughing. \"What's going on?\" says the man filming with his smartphone. And then, police - in vans and on foot. Their black rubber shoulder protection giving them the kind of silhouettes usually associated with science fiction heroes. And the crowd starts to chant, \"<i>Merci, merci</i>\" - Thank you, thank you.</p>\n<p>\"I couldn't believe it,\" says Jean-Marc Berliere who was there. \"Here was a young, urban, intellectual crowd applauding the police! I saw women giving them flowers. I saw people shaking their hands. I saw women kissing them. And you could see how moved the police were. It was so unexpected.\"</p>\n<p>For Audrey, it made her realise that \"this job is, in fact, fantastic\".</p>\n<p>Something like this had happened only once before, says Berliere, at the liberation of Paris in August 1944. The police were the first to rise up against the Germans before the Allies got there. \"Afterwards, when they marched, the crowds shouted '<i>Vive les flics!</i>' - Long live the cops!\" he says.</p>\n<p>It's not clear if the police's popularity will last, or if it will sag like a souffle in a police canteen. </p>\n<p>A video of a police officer hitting a young black demonstrator at a recent demonstration against labour reforms has not helped their image. Neither has a book by renowned anthropologist Didier Fassin, La Force de l'Ordre (Security Forces). He was allowed to follow the police in one part of the Paris region from 2005 to 2007 and reports widespread brutality and racism. </p>\n<p>But, for the time being at least, a significant part of the French population is seeing the police in a new way. As heroes.</p>\n<p><i>Subscribe to the </i><a href=\"https://ssl.bbc.co.uk/newsletters/newsmagazine?ptrt=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine\" class=\"story-body__link\">BBC News Magazine's email newsletter</a><i> to get articles sent to your inbox.</i></p>"

			"title": "BBC The strange way people looked at food in the 16th Century",
			"date_published": 1461150898,
			"body": "\n<p class=\"story-body__introduction\">It may seem a peculiarly 21st Century preoccupation, but people in Shakespeare's England were also obsessed with food, writes Dr Joan Fitzpatrick. </p>\n<p>The 16th Century had plenty of diet books. </p>\n<p>Andrew Boorde's Compendious Regiment (1542) warns against eating and drinking to excess and often remarks upon the behaviour and diet of English people, noting that the English spend too long sitting at dinner and supper, feeding on heavy meats before lighter ones, which isn't good for their digestion. </p>\n<p>William Bullein's Government of Health (1558) takes the form of a dialogue between John, a self-confessed glutton, and Humphrey, a man of moderate habits. </p>\n<p>In Sir John Falstaff, Shakespeare's notorious glutton, we're presented with a character who defies both dietary and religious authorities by eating and drinking to excess whenever he pleases. </p>\n<p>It was generally believed that eating meat was divinely ordained and the dietary authors promoted meat as more healthy than a vegetarian diet, although it had to be considered whether or not a specific meat was suited to one's \"humour\", occupation, and even nationality. </p>\n<p>For example, bacon was thought fitting only for labourers or those involved in physical activity because it was difficult to digest and vigorous work would help this process. </p>\n<p>Chicken was regarded more favourably and was specifically recommended by some as a food for the sick, but it was expensive in Shakespeare's time so only the wealthy would eat the bird's flesh. </p>\n<p>In Shakespeare, capons are an indulgence - they are a favourite of Sir John Falstaff , and in The Two Gentlemen of Verona Launce's dog Crab steals a capon-leg from Sylvia's table. </p>\n<p>Boorde thought that beef was \"good meate for an English man\", a view that disagreed with ancient medical authorities such as Galen who believed that beef was a cold and heavy meat that provoked melancholy. </p>\n<p>It was thought that the cold English climate made English stomachs hotter than those of their Mediterranean neighbours and so better able to digest a meat like beef, which was also more tender in England as the cattle fed on pasture. </p>\n<p>In Shakespeare's time beef was thought to stir up courage, something emphasised by classical philosophers and evident in Henry V when the French Constable says of the English soldiers \"give them great meals of beef, and iron and steel, they will eat like wolves and fight like devils\". </p>\n<p>On the other hand, it was believed that beef caused stupidity, something Shakespeare refers to twice - in Twelfth Night when Andrew Aguecheek observes \"Methinks sometimes I have no more wit than a Christian or an ordinary man has; but I am a great eater of beef, and I believe that does harm to my wit\", and in Troilus and Cressida when Ajax curses Thersites: \"The plague of Greece upon thee, thou mongrel beef-witted lord!\" </p>\n<p>Beef might be served in pies, which the English were especially fond of. They also liked pasties, like today's, enclosed in a pastry crust and baked without a dish, which usually had only one filling, venison being a popular choice. </p>\n<p>In The Merry Wives of Windsor Master Page offers a venison pasty to Slender and Sir John Falstaff for dinner. The Lenten pie referred to by Mercutio in Romeo and Juliet wouldn't have contained any meat because Lent was a time for fasting and fish would have taken the place of meat at the dinner table.</p>\n<p>These days we are generally encouraged by health professionals to eat more fish and reduce our intake of red meat but in Shakespeare's time fish was considered inferior to meat. People viewed it as less nourishing, but it was also associated with the Catholic practice of not eating meat on Fridays. </p>\n<p>\"Fish days\" had been introduced by the government for economic reasons, to encourage the fishing industry and bring down the high price of meat, but the fish days were disliked by England's Protestants because they reminded them of England's Catholic past. </p>\n<p>In King Lear the disguised Kent says to Lear: \"I do profess to be no less than I seem, to serve him truly that will put me in trust, to love him that is honest, to converse with him that is wise and says little, to fear judgement, to fight when I cannot choose, and to eat no fish.\" </p>\n<p>This all suggests that Kent is a loyal Protestant and therefore a man who can be trusted. In Shakespeare's Henry IV part 2 Falstaff criticises Hal's sober brother, Prince John. \"There's never none of these demure boys come to any proof; for thin drink doth so overcool their blood, and making many fish meals, that they fall into a kind of male green-sickness; and then when they marry, they get wenches.\" </p>\n<p>\"Green sickness\" was an anaemic disease commonly attributed to a virgin's sexual fantasies that could be cured by a sexual encounter, and by the phrase \"get wenches\" Falstaff means \"produce girl children\". In other words, Falstaff is suggesting that Prince John is weak and effeminate because he is not properly nourished. </p>\n<p>However, Falstaff himself eats fish - a receipt in his pocket shows he has enjoyed \"anchovies and sack [Spanish white wine] after supper\". Anchovies and also herring, preserved in salt or pickled, were commonly sold as snacks in taverns, which would explain why they bother Sir Toby Belch in Twelfth Night (\"A plague o' these pickle herring!\"). While eating fish occasionally or as a snack was fine (at least acceptable to someone like Falstaff), to eat \"many fish meals\" was suspiciously Catholic.</p>\n<p>Animal flesh was preferred over fish and also considered healthier than \"fruit\", a term that included not only what we consider fruit today but also what we consider vegetables. Fruit was believed to be full of water that could cause a harmful imbalance in the body. It was generally believed that before the biblical Flood the human constitution was stronger and fruits contained less moisture but that after the Flood fruit provided less nourishment and made men more vulnerable to disease. </p>\n<p>It was believed to be at this point that God ordained the consumption of animal flesh by humans. Dietary authors advised eating fruit only occasionally, and before meals, avoiding the French habit of eating it after meals (for dessert). </p>\n<p>This is a shortened version of Joan Fitzpatrick's talk, \"'Wolf All?' Shakespeare and Food in Renaissance England,\" for Radio 3's <strong>The Essay</strong>, to be broadcast at 22:45 BST on 27 April - <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006x3hl\" class=\"story-body__link\">catch up on BBC iPlayer</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/timelines/z8k2p39\" class=\"story-body__link\">BBC iWonder - William Shakespeare: The Life and Legacy of England's Bard</a></p>\n<p>But people still ate fruit, which was sold in the streets and markets and picked from bushes and in hedgerows by those who could not afford to buy it or be fussy about what they ate. </p>\n<p>New and fashionable fruits, such as apricots and melons, were being imported into England from southern Europe and dried fruits such as raisins and figs were also available to those who could afford them. </p>\n<p>Pumpkin seeds have been found in excavations of the Rose and Globe playhouses and so it's possible that pumpkins or pumpkin seeds were consumed by wealthier members of the audience. Pumpkins were considered especially watery - in The Merry Wives of Windsor Mistress Ford describes Falstaff as \"this unwholesome humidity, this gross watery pumpkin\". </p>\n<p>For modern readers one of the strangest ideas to emerge from early modern dietary books is the fact that human breast-milk was recommended as a drink for adults as well as children. </p>\n<p>Bullein claims \"the best milk that helpeth against consumptions is woman's milk\". When we recognise this, references to milk and milkiness in the plays begin to make more sense. </p>\n<p>Lady Macbeth worries that her husband is \"too full o' th' milk of human kindness\". The line is clearly figurative, but might there be a literal suggestion too? </p>\n<p>These accusations of milkiness suggest two kinds of weakness - the producers of milk were weak because they were women, and the consumers were the weak, the old, the sick, or babies. </p>\n<p>Milk from animals and other \"white meats\", such as butter and cheese, were usually manufactured by women and they evoked distinct national stereotypes, butter being especially associated with the Dutch and cheese with the Welsh. </p>\n<p>Boorde recommends that butter be eaten \"in the morning before other meats\" (or foods), noting that \"French men will eat it after meat\" and \"Dutch men doth eat it at all times in the day\". </p>\n<p>In The Merry Wives of Windsor Master Ford claims he wouldn't trust a Fleming with his butter but most of the references to butter in this play and in Henry IV part 1 are made by or about Falstaff. In The Merry Wives of Windsor Sir Hugh Evans, conforms to stereotype by looking forward to a dessert of cheese: \"I will make an end of my dinner; there's pippins and cheese to come\". </p>\n<p>Pippins, a variety of apple, were considered difficult to digest, especially if eaten raw and cheese was thought helpful to close the stomach after a meal. Cheese was traditionally a food for the poor but after 1600 it became more fashionable, especially hard cheese that took more time to mature and was imported from abroad.  </p>\n<p>In Shakespeare's time people thought that sugar was healthy, indeed it was used as a medicine to treat lots of conditions such as stomach problems. Boorde approved of all food and drink containing sugar as especially nutritious and it was thought that old people craved sugar.</p>\n<p>Like our ancestors we too believe that some foods are better for us than others, even if we wouldn't agree with them about what those foods are. But we also share with our ancestors the belief that good health, above all other things, is what matters most. </p>\n<p>This year marks 400 years since William Shakespeare's death.

We will be investing on a commercial basis. We would not see this as nationalisation. We would not be seeking to acquire a control in the business. We don't think that nationalisation is the right answer.\"</p>\n<p>The steel industry welcomed the financial support package as \"a positive first step\".</p>\n<p>Gareth Stace, director of UK Steel, said: \"We have been calling for government to step up to the mark and provide this type of financial commitment and backing. </p>\n<p>\"We are not yet out of the woods however. Further action is still needed on energy costs and business rates whilst at EU level, we still need to see tougher action on the dumping of cheap imports. This will then provide the level playing field which will give UK companies a fighting chance to compete.\"</p>\n<p>On Tuesday, it emerged that Stuart Wilkie, managing director of Tata's Strip Products at Port Talbot, had canvassed workers about joining a bid by investing up to £10,000 of their own money.</p>\n<p>Tata Steel employs more than 10,000 people in the UK, and supports thousands of others, across plants in Port Talbot, Rotherham, Corby, Shotton and Teesside. The UK operations are losing about £1m a day.</p>\n<p>Tata's Scunthorpe operation, which employs more than 3,000, has been sold to investment firm Greybull Capital for a nominal £1.</p>\n<p>On Monday <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-36073140\" class=\"story-body__link\">Mr Javid joined ministers</a> and trade officials from 30 countries at a meeting in Brussels to discuss the global glut of steel.</p>\n<p>Although that meeting broke up without agreement, Mr Javid said that China had vowed to address \"a problem of overcapacity in their country\".</p>"

It will resettle children and their families \"where the UNHCR deems resettlement is in the best interests of the child.\"</p>\n<p>Several hundred people are expected to be resettled in the UK by April 2017 \"with a view to resettling up to 3,000 over the lifetime of this Parliament\", the government said. </p>\n<p>The five-year Syrian civil war has created more than 4.5 million refugees across the region - half of them children in need of food, education and a home. The UN has warned that a <a href=\"http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=53145#.VxjLOPn4-Uk\" class=\"story-body__link-external\">whole generation of Syrian children is at risk</a>.</p>\n<p>Immigration Minister James Brokenshire said:  \"We have always been clear that the vast majority of vulnerable children are better off remaining in host countries in the region so they can be reunited with surviving family members. However, there are exceptional circumstances in which it is in a child's best interests to be resettled in the UK. </p>\n<p> \"We have engaged with a number of NGOs, including the UNHCR on the best way to provide protection to refugee children and ensure their welfare and safety remain at the heart of every decision made.\"</p>\n<p>The scheme will be reviewed after two years.</p>\n<p>The announcement was welcomed by Children's Commissioner for England Anne Longfield, who said the children would get the \"vital protection and support they need\" in the UK.</p>\n<p>But Yvette Cooper, chairwoman of Labour's Refugee Taskforce, said the announcement included \"nothing new to help the thousands of child refugees alone in Europe who are at risk of trafficking, sexual exploitation and abuse\". </p>\n<p>\"Children are risking their lives every day making dangerous journeys, and Europol estimate at least 10,000 children have disappeared in the crisis, many trafficked into prostitution and modern slavery. Many children are sleeping rough or in makeshift camps because children's homes are full, and many have been sexually abused and exploited too.\"</p>\n<p>And Lib Dem leader Tim Farron suggested that the move was a \"cynical\" ploy - a bid to \"buy off\" Conservative backbenchers ahead of a Commons vote on the issue of unaccompanied children in the camps      next week.</p>\n<p>He told the BBC the announcement would not help the 30,000 unaccompanied children who have made it to Europe already but are at risks in camps:  \"Of those 30,000, 10,000 have gone missing. David Cameron has the ability, should he wish to do so, to step in and prevent these children who are go missing into the hands of child sexual exploiters, human traffickers... And yet once again he's failed to take the opportunity.\" </p>\n<p>And Labour's Lord Dubs, who moved the amendment to the Immigration Bill calling on the government to take in 3,000 child refugees already in Europe, said: \"While I welcome this proposal, it doesn't deal sufficiently with the substance of my amendment.\"</p>\n<p>\"You also have to wonder whether the use of the 3,000 figure is a deliberate ploy to muddy the debate.\" </p>\n<p>The government has already committed to resettle another 20,000 Syrian refugees under the Vulnerable Persons Resettlement Scheme, 1,000 of whom have already arrived, including more than 500 children.</p>"

But the evidence pointed to them not being afraid to use guns themselves to expand their influence. </p>\n<p>\"They wanted to move up in the criminal world from regional to international gangsters. The group was motivated by profit, so we can only speculate that some of these weapons would have been sold to whoever had the means to pay the asking price.\"</p>\n<p>After Shilling and Defraine were found guilty of conspiring to import and sell the weapons, the judge, Mr Justice Topolski, told them they both faced the possibility of life sentences.</p>\n<p>\"Criminals like you at or near the top of criminal organisations invariably pose a serious danger to the public,\" he said. </p>\n<p>A life sentence would come in for \"serious consideration\", he added.</p>\n<p>David Payne, 43, Richard Rye, 24, and Christopher Owen, 30, had already pleaded guilty to smuggling the weapons into the country. </p>\n<p>Payne and Rye also admitted the second count relating to conspiracy to sell the arsenal.</p>\n<p>All five will be sentenced on 13 May. </p>\n<p>The guns - 22 assault rifles similar to AK-47s, and nine Skorpion sub-machine guns - were brought into the UK from Boulogne on a 38ft (12m) cruiser, the MV Albernina, the court heard.</p>\n<p>All had originally been deactivated but were reactivated before they, along with a large amount of ammunition, were smuggled up the Medway into Kent, arriving near Cuxton Marina on 10 August last year.</p>\n<p>But detectives had the plotters under surveillance and swooped to seize the cache before it could be buried and then sold, the court heard.</p>\n<p>The court heard each of the 22 Czech-made assault rifles would have fetched up to £4,000, even though they were sold at \"shockingly low\" prices in Eastern Europe.</p>\n<p>The Skorpion machine guns, originally developed for use by Czech special forces, would have netted £3,500 apiece.</p>\n<p>On 11 August, the gang was seen by investigators unloading the cruiser, the jury was told, and a number of large heavy bags were loaded into a white van which was driven away by Payne. </p>\n<p>Shilling and Defraine were arrested outside a branch of the DIY store Homebase, where they had just bought spades and other tools, the court heard.</p>"

I said 'I would absolutely love to', because I had a very clear idea of what I would like to do and how I'd like to go about it and it was a very happy experience.\"  </p>\n<p>Hamilton said many people thought there was a formula for making a Bond film but he didn't agree. </p>\n<p>But he said the key to Bond's survival was \"that anyone to do with Bond is not lazy\". </p>\n<p>\"I work very hard, I drive people very hard\", he admitted. </p>\n<p>He was at the helm at the golden age of Bond films and oversaw when the role passed from Sean Connery to Roger Moore in 1973.</p>\n<p>Speaking about his style of directing he said he wanted value for money. </p>\n<p>\"In the making of Bond films we are some of the meanest toughest film makers.

			"body": "\n<p class=\"story-body__introduction\">As she celebrates her 90th birthday, the image of the Queen on stage and screen is more prevalent than ever. But what is it like to play one of the most famous faces in the world - and what makes so many want to do so? </p>\n<p>Playing the Queen could be daunting for many actresses. But two who have done exactly that on stage say there is one crucial element for getting into character - the wig.</p>\n<p>Emma Handy played Liz - the 1980s version of the Queen - in the recent touring production of Moira Buffini play Handbagged, which imagines older and younger versions of the Queen and Margaret Thatcher in conversation during their weekly audience. </p>\n<p>\"The wig and make-up and clothes do so much,\" she says. \"It's extraordinary.\" </p>\n<p>But, adds Handy: \"She seems to have two faces - the public and the private face. There is very little footage of her private life, but she is known to be enormously mischievous - and these are things I have in common with her.\"   </p>\n<p>One thing Handy was adamant about was not doing an impersonation of the Queen - instead she focused on capturing her \"essence\". She says she found sitting \"incredibly straight-backed\" helped. </p>\n<p>\"She's probably the most photographed person in the world, so everyone has an idea of her,\" says Handy. </p>\n<p>\"Every year you see the Christmas broadcast, but that's not who she is. There is a massive side of her people don't know.\"</p>\n<p>Marion Bailey, who played Q - the older Queen - in the West End production, says: \"It is irresistible to play the Queen. When I was cast, I mentioned it to a few people and someone said I didn't look anything like the Queen. </p>\n<p>\"And I replied: 'Oh, but I do,'\". I've often sat in make-up chairs and had my hair in a particular way, looked in the mirror and thought: 'You know what? I could do the Queen,'.\"</p>\n<p>In preparation for the London run of the play, initially at the Tricycle Theatre before transferring to the Vaudeville Theatre, she says she watched all the Queen's Christmas messages - as well as anything else she could find online. </p>\n<p>And the reaction was everything she could have hoped for. </p>\n<p>\"Some nights I would walk out and there would be gasps,\" she says. \"It was to do with the look of it and the history, and I tried to get as many of the mannerisms as I could. On the West End transfer, I heard an American tourist whisper: 'Is that the Queen?'.\"  </p>\n<p>Prof Philip Murphy, director of the Institute of Commonwealth Studies at the University of London, says the closest the public ever got to seeing the real Queen was in the 1969 documentary Royal Family.</p>\n<p>But Prof Murphy says: \"The Royal Family effectively suppressed it. They decided it reduced the mystique around them. </p>\n<p>\"In a way, that creates a carte blanche for writers and satirists to make up personalities.\"</p>\n<p>He adds: \"That's the problem the Royal Family has - they want to appear human but they also want to appear somehow removed and keep this dignified distance.\"</p>\n<p>One issue with writing about the Queen is that \"fact and fiction gets mixed up\", he says. </p>\n<p>\"The public have very little sense of what actually goes on. But a plausible fictional representation can almost seep into historical record.\"</p>\n<p>Portrayals of the Queen have not always been the most flattering, he notes.</p>\n<p>\"Spitting Image was an attack on British deference around authority figures - and there were no more esteemed than the Royal Family,\" says the professor.  </p>\n<p>One of the lead writers of that series was author John O'Farrell, who says: \"If you cast your mind back to the 1980s, there was an enormous reverential style. It was seen as poor form to laugh at the Queen's expense... But what we did was show her to be an ordinary person in an ordinary family, which is where it struck a comic nerve,\" he says.</p>\n<p>He adds: \"The tabloids faked outrage, but people loved it... At times it was crude and disrespectful - but I think that's warranted.\"</p>\n<p>Alison Jackson is someone else whose work has attracted controversy. Her apparently candid photographs of celebrities in private moments are created with the help of carefully-chosen lookalikes. </p>\n<p>Thanks to Jackson, we see \"the Queen\" putting out dog food for her corgis, taking a selfie and doing the washing-up. </p>\n<p>\"I thought it would be really good to get her doing normal things,\" says Jackson. </p>\n<p>\"She is a person, after all. And she does do normal things - she reads, she drives a Land Rover, she gets her hands dirty - she's quite tomboyish, really.

			"body": "\n<p class=\"story-body__introduction\">Elections for police and crime commissioners will take place across most of England and Wales on 5 May. Here is a guide to what PCCs do and how the system, introduced in 2012, works.</p>\n<p>PCCs are elected representatives who work to ensure police forces in England and Wales are running effectively. They replaced police authorities in 2012 and were intended to bring a public voice to policing. </p>\n<p>The government insists PCCs are not there to run local police forces but to hold them to account and respond to the needs of the public. </p>\n<p>There is no PCC in London because the mayor is responsible for policing.</p>\n<p>In the first PCC elections held in November 2012, 192 candidates stood for the 41 posts covering England and Wales. </p>\n<p class=\"ns_super_impact__fig\">15%</p>\n<p>turnout</p>\n<p class=\"ns_super_impact__fig\">192</p>\n<p>candidates</p>\n<p><span class=\"ns_impact__fig\">16</span> Conservatives elected </p>\n<p><span class=\"ns_impact__fig\">13</span> Labour </p>\n<p><span class=\"ns_impact__fig\">12</span> Independents </p>\n<p>Sixteen Conservative PCCs were elected, 13 from Labour and 12 Independents. Among the successful independent candidates were eight former police officers, one of Wales' most senior barristers, and an ex-pilot. Six women were elected (from 35 who stood as candidates) and 35 men.</p>\n<p>In this year's election on 5 May there are 40 votes being held - because Greater Manchester is not holding an election. The region is set to vote for the new post of elected mayor in 2017 and the powers and responsibilities of the PCC will fall to the mayor. Since last May PCC Tony Lloyd, who was elected in 2012, has held the post of interim mayor. </p>\n<p>This time there are 188 candidates standing. Labour and the Conservatives are fielding candidates in each area, with UKIP putting forward 34 candidates and the Liberal Democrats 30. Of those elected in 2012, 26 are standing again, as are two successful candidates from by-elections held in 2014.</p>\n<p>PCCs' responsibilities include: </p>\n<p>Police and crime commissioners cannot tell the police how to do their job - despite having some control over the direction of a force. The operational independence of the police is protected by legislation. </p>\n<p>New measures proposed in the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/policing-and-crime-bill\" class=\"story-body__link-external\">Policing and Crime Bill</a>, which is currently passing through Parliament, would enable PCCs to <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-34224491\" class=\"story-body__link\">take on responsibility for fire and rescue services</a>. The Home Office said it wanted to encourage more \"efficiency and effectiveness\" but the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-35138665\" class=\"story-body__link\">Fire Brigades Union called the idea \"dangerous\"</a> and a \"half-baked suggestion\" and the Local Government Association said it saw no \"pressing need\" for the change.</p>\n<p>Public elections for the first police and crime commissioners took place on 15 November 2012 in 41 police force areas across England and Wales, not including London. The elections - 37 in England and four in Wales - were described as the biggest shake-up of policing for almost 50 years but the turnout was the lowest in peacetime Britain. One polling station in Newport, Gwent, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-20355358\" class=\"story-body__link\">was visited by no voters at all</a>.</p>\n<p>Fewer than 15% of voters turned out in the 41 police areas electing a PCC, prompting the Electoral Commission to hold <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-21836934\" class=\"story-body__link\">a review into how the polls were conducted</a>. The inquiry found 80% of voters felt they did not have enough information to make an informed choice. The commission's chairwoman Jenny Watson said: \"The government took a number of decisions about how to run these elections that we did not agree with.\"</p>\n<p>All registered voters are entitled to take part in the elections. The supplementary vote system is used in all force areas where more than two candidates stand, with voters marking the ballot paper with their first and second choice of candidate. In the 2016 elections there are at least three candidates standing for each post.</p>\n<p>A PCC's term of office is four years, with a maximum of two terms.</p>\n<p>The idea of giving local people more of a say in how the police in their area are run had been championed for years by some Conservatives as a way of boosting local democracy - but it only became party policy at the 2010 general election.  </p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/sites/default/files/resources/coalition_programme_for_government.pdf\" class=\"story-body__link-external\">coalition agreement</a> published after the May 2010 election contained a pledge to make the police \"more accountable through oversight by a directly elected individual\". The proposal was fleshed out in the white paper \"<a href=\"http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/consultations/policing-21st-century/policing-21st-full-pdf?view=Binary\" class=\"story-body__link-external\">Policing in the 21st Century</a>\" and enacted in the <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2012/1129/made\" class=\"story-body__link-external\">Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act</a>, which became law in 2011.</p>\n<p>London has a directly elected mayor, who acts as the police and crime commissioner for the Metropolitan police area. London's police and crime panel is formed from a committee of elected London Assembly members. The commissioner of the Metropolitan Police continues to be a Royal appointment on the advice of the home secretary. </p>\n<p>In 2014 Chancellor George Osborne <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-29876939\" class=\"story-body__link\">announced plans for an elected mayor for Greater Manchester</a> as part of a project to hand more devolved power to the north.</p>\n<p>Manchester's PCC <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-32929721\" class=\"story-body__link\">Tony Lloyd became the city's interim mayor</a> in May 2015, retaining the PCC responsibilities when he transferred to his new role. Mancunians will vote for an elected mayor for the first time in 2017 and, as in London, the mayor will continue to oversee policing.</p>\n<p>PCCs are required to swear an oath of impartiality when they are elected to office. This echoes the commitment police officers make to serve every member of the public impartially. Before the introduction of PCCs, the government promised the way investigations were carried out would not become political.</p>\n<p>PCCs have to answer to the public - the government has said their performance \"should be judged solely by the electorate\" - and more than two-thirds of the commissioners are asking voters to re-elect them in 2016.</p>\n<p>And people can complain to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) if they think their PCC has broken the law.</p>\n<p>In addition to this, Police and Crime Panels were set up in each force area to scrutinise and challenge the actions and decisions of each PCC. A panel may require the attendance of the PCC, has the power to suspend them from office because of a criminal offence, or exercise a veto over a proposed candidate for chief constable. </p>\n<p>But in July 2013, less than a year into the new system, the Home Affairs Select Committee <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-23387324\" class=\"story-body__link\">said it seemed \"very easy\" for a PCC to remove a chief constable for \"insubstantial\" reasons</a> and advised police and crime panels should be more vigorous in analysing contentious decisions by PCCs, such as the sacking of a chief constable.</p>\n<p>In England, panels are mainly made up of representatives from each local authority in a police force area. In Wales, they are free-standing public bodies, set up and maintained by the secretary of state, rather than local authority committees.</p>\n<p>When the role was introduced, ministers insisted the cost of PCCs and police and crime panels must be no greater than the abolished police authorities. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-22624096\" class=\"story-body__link\">In 2013, BBC research</a> revealed the salaries of the majority of the PCCs were between £70,000 and £85,000, although the commissioners overseeing the three major forces of Greater Manchester, West Yorkshire and West Midlands were each receiving £100,000. It was also calculated that PCCs across England and Wales had employed at least 449 people in the six months after their introduction.</p>\n<p>Salaries are recommended by the Senior Salaries Review Body, which advises on the remuneration of those in public office, and approved by the home secretary.</p>\n<p>During the first year PCCs were in office, there were four investigations carried out by the IPCC, as well as investigations by the CPS into expenses claims. And MPs on the Home Affairs Committee <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-22636857\" class=\"story-body__link\">warned ministers were failing to properly monitor the salaries</a> and standards of PCCs.</p>\n<p>In 2014, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-29220535\" class=\"story-body__link\">South Yorkshire's PCC Shaun Wright resigned</a> over the Rotherham child abuse scandal. He had faced demands to step down in the wake of a report that found at least 1,400 children were abused in the town from 1997 to 2013. Mr Wright, who had been the head of children's services in Rotherham between 2005 and 2010, eventually said he was stepping down as PCC to ensure the \"important issues\" outlined in the report could be discussed and considered \"without distraction\".</p>\n<p>Home Secretary Theresa May had called for Mr Wright to stand down and - in the few days before he did so - the controversy prompted then Deputy Prime Minister and Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg, whose party helped pass the legislation that created PCCs, to describe the role as a \"discredited experiment\" and <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-29172812\" class=\"story-body__link\">say PCCs should be abolished</a>.</p>\n<p>Just three months after being elected Lincolnshire PCC Alan Hardwick suspended his temporary chief constable Neil Rhodes over an employment dispute. But <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-lincolnshire-21964844\" class=\"story-body__link\">a judicial review into the suspension ruled in favour of Mr Rhodes</a>, with a judge calling the suspension \"irrational and perverse\", and he was reinstated. The row also saw the chairman of the crime panel stand down. Speaking at the time, Mr Hardwick, who is not standing for re-election, said he accepted the judge's decision and added: \"The rules governing PCCs don't really envisage this sort of thing, there is more guidance needed.\"</p>\n<p>Kent PCC Ann Barnes, an Independent, has been a controversial figure during her tenure and announced in March she <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-kent-35794996\" class=\"story-body__link\">would not be standing for re-election</a>. A report last year found she <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-kent-34647110\" class=\"story-body__link\">may not have been properly insured</a> when she was in a car crash and she was criticised for <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-kent-27478691\" class=\"story-body__link\">taking part in a documentary</a> and for her appointments of youth commissioners. In a <a href=\"http://kent-pcc.gov.uk/home.php?entry_id=1457787639\" class=\"story-body__link-external\">statement on her website</a> when she said she would not be standing in the 2016 election, Ms Barnes said the people of Kent had been getting a better service and added: \"I am content that I have delivered what I said I would.\"</p>\n<p>Cumbria's PCC, Richard Rhodes, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-22220707\" class=\"story-body__link\">apologised for using a chauffeur-driven ca</a>r that cost £700 of taxpayers' money for just two trips and admitted he had failed to check how much it would cost. The former head teacher paid the money back and said at the time he understood the public concern over the case. Cumbria Police arrested three people in connection with leaking the information but no charges were brought. Mr Rhodes is not standing for re-election.</p>\n<p>When he was just over six months into the role Bob Jones, the West Midlands PCC, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-birmingham-22797713\" class=\"story-body__link\">said PCCs should be scrapped</a> and replaced with something more efficient and less party political. Mr Jones <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-birmingham-28108283\" class=\"story-body__link\">died in July 2014</a> aged 59 and a by-election was held to replace him the following month. The turnout for the by-election was just 10.4% - lower than the 12% in the West Midlands in 2012 - and the cost of the poll was estimated at £3.7m, nearly £20 for every vote cast.</p>\n<p>Supporters argue that elected commissioners make policing more accountable and responsive to local needs because, for example, they consult with victims of crime when setting policing priorities. They also say PCCs bring valuable outside experience to forces.</p>\n<p>Home secretary Theresa May, who introduced the role, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/police-and-crime-commissioners-the-choice-is-yours\" class=\"story-body__link-external\">says PCCs \"have engaged with the public</a> over the past three-and-a-half years in ways that police authorities never did or could\".</p>\n<p>In 2012 opponents warned PCCs could lead to the politicisation of the police, with commissioners favouring headline-grabbing initiatives. They also feared commissioners could interfere with the running of police forces. </p>\n<p>Critics have also questioned whether PCCs have real legitimacy following the low turnout of just over 15% in the 2012 elections.</p>\n<p>Police authorities, first established in 1964 to hold chief constables to account, had oversight of the police before PCCs. They were made up of local councillors and independent, appointed members. But the coalition government concluded police authorities were \"invisible\" and needed replacing with elected commissioners and police and crime panels. </p>"

			"body": "\n<p class=\"story-body__introduction\">In St Clair County, Illinois, the local prosecutor is trying a radical new experiment: admitting his office has charged innocent people with crimes and clearing their names before they spend a day in prison. It's a unique reform effort as prosecutors around the country face increased scrutiny and diminishing public trust.</p>\n<p>Lashonda Moreland's day had barely begun when the pounding on the front door began. Her husband had already left for work, and she was home with her two children in their second storey apartment in a suburb of St Louis, Missouri. </p>\n<p>When a voice barked through the door, Moreland realised the figures outside were police officers. </p>\n<p>\"He said, 'You need to open up the door or we're going to kick it down,'\" she recalls. \"My kids are scared and they're crying...I'm upset and I start crying.\"</p>\n<p>The police arrested Moreland - a 30-year-old home healthcare worker with no criminal history - and she spent the next several days in various jails until she was transferred over the river to St Clair County, Illinois.</p>\n<p>\"It was scary because I had never been in jail. I never had to be on lockdown,\" she says. \"I literally cried every day. I was trying to wrap my mind around, 'Why am I in here?'\"</p>\n<p>Moreland was accused of shoplifting, evading police and for trying to run down a police officer with her car. </p>\n<p>Several months prior to her arrest, a young couple walked into an Old Navy store in a strip mall in Fairview Heights, Illinois. They shoveled little girls' coats, jeans and pants into bags, some still attached to their hangers, then walked out and got into a maroon Buick LeSabre with nearly $700 (£495) worth of stolen merchandise. A security guard called the police.</p>\n<p>The responding officers from the Fairview Heights Police Department quickly located the car at a traffic signal, and an officer named Drew Rutter got out of his patrol vehicle and approached the driver's side of the Buick on foot.</p>\n<p>\"The driver and I made eye contact, and I observed her grasp the steering wheel,\" Rutter later wrote in his report. \"Fearing for my life and the safety of others in the area, I immediately drew my department issued duty weapon.\"</p>\n<p>The car lurched past him and another officer, missing Rutter's legs by \"inches\", and disappeared down the highway.</p>\n<p>All the police had was the licence plate number, which was registered to Lashonda Moreland's address. When Officer Rutter looked at Moreland's driver's licence photo, he immediately identified her as the woman who had tried to run him over. </p>\n<p>Moreland didn't own a Buick, nor did she do her shopping 30 minutes away in a completely different state. She did, however, have a cousin who had registered his maroon Buick LeSabre to her address without telling her. She explained all this to the Fairview Heights police when they first contacted her after the incident, but they didn't believe her.</p>\n<p>Things looked bad for Moreland. She couldn't prove her alibi and the witness who placed her at the scene was an officer of the law. She was facing up to 11 years in prison. </p>\n<p>Instead of getting dragged through a jury trial, something surprising happened. Moreland's lawyer Kristi Flint told the St Clair County state's attorney office that her client was innocent. In response, the prosecutor offered Moreland the chance to take a polygraph test. Flint nervously agreed, and Moreland passed. Six months after her arrest, the charges were dropped. Everyone, including the Fairview Heights police department, agrees that Moreland is innocent. </p>\n<p>Moreland did not know it at the time, but she was the beneficiary of a new programme created by St Clair County State's Attorney Brendan Kelly: the Actual Innocence Claim Policy and Protocol. It is a unique, pre-conviction intervention which attempts to prevent the \"actually innocent\" from going through a trial, taking a plea deal, or ending up in prison.</p>\n<p>Actual innocence is a legal concept which means, simply, that a defendant did not commit the crime of which he or she is accused. It is usually invoked when a prison inmate is attempting to appeal his sentence, but Kelly wanted to bring the spirit of the concept to the pre-conviction level. </p>\n<p>\"That's distinct from 'I didn't get treated fairly',\" says Kelly, a Navy veteran who became the county's top law enforcement officer in 2010 when he was only 34 years old. \"It's not, 'Some of the evidence was obtained unlawfully, there was an incorrect ruling by the court, on the trial level some error by the defense' - no, you actually have the wrong person here...they're actually innocent.\"</p>\n<p>Since Kelly implemented the policy two years ago, nine defendants - including Lashonda Moreland - have had their charges dropped before trial. Those cases include a reckless homicide by vehicle, four armed robberies and one murder. </p>\n<p>To the best of his knowledge, no other prosecutor in the country is attempting anything quite like it. Even the US Department of Justice has taken an interest in what is happening in St Clair County.</p>\n<p>\"I think it is a nightmare scenario for any prosecutor or any police officer to have investigated and prosecuted and convicted the wrong person,\" says Kelly. \"That strikes at our very sense of what our job is all about, which is to seek justice.\"</p>\n<p>There is an increasing body of evidence that suggests that local prosecutors had an enormous hand in the explosion of the US prison population. </p>\n<p>Theirs is an incredibly powerful position in the American criminal justice system, though the job is not well understood by the general public. Popular works of true crime journalism like Netflix's Making a Murderer and the podcast Serial are beginning to change that, and cast the prosecutors in each case in a fairly villainous light.</p>\n<p>\"Between 1994 and 2008, the main cause of rising prison populations is DAs [district attorneys] filing felony cases. This seems to be true across the United States,\" says John Pfaff, a professor at Fordham Law School.  \"DAs have kind of managed to avoid a lot of attention for a long time.\"</p>\n<p>Simply put, prosecutors decide what crimes to charge defendants with. A single crime can have a smorgasbord of potential charging options for prosecutors, ones that can come with short or extremely long mandatory minimum sentences. In the \"tough on crime\" era of the late 1990s, prosecutors started bringing harsher charges more often. Since the vast majority of cases settle with a plea deal, those charges and their sentences stick, meaning prosecutors essentially dictate how much time a person will serve. Only a tiny number of defendants go to trial to challenge the prosecutor. </p>\n<p>\"District attorneys have almost unfettered discretion on who to charge and who not to charge,\" says Pfaff. \"There's almost no judicial review of what kind of charges you choose, as long as the facts are there to back them up.\"</p>\n<p>The introduction of DNA evidence was a game changer in terms of public awareness of the choices prosecutors make. Suddenly, inmates who'd served decades in prison or been sentenced to the death were able to prove they were innocent. There have been<a href=\"http://www.law.umich.edu/special/exoneration/Pages/about.aspx\" class=\"story-body__link-external\"> 1,773 exonerations in the US</a> since 1989. </p>\n<p>This has shone a new light on hard-charging prosecutors who fought for the convictions in the first place, and then sometimes opposed the inmates' bid for freedom, even after DNA evidence contradicted their theory of the crime.</p>\n<p>\"I think because of some of the professional incentives to get convictions and maintain convictions, and political incentives to be tough on crime, the justice role takes a back seat to the advocacy role,\" says Northeastern University law professor Daniel Medwed, author of Prosecution Complex: America's Race to Convict and Its Impact on the Innocent. </p>\n<p>\"It's a little bit of human nature. Once you've made a decision to do something, it often takes a lot of countervailing evidence to get them to change their minds.\"</p>\n<p>But not all prosecutors have buried their heads in the sand when it comes to cases of actual innocence. In the last five years, the number of prosecutors who created so-called <a href=\"http://www.law.umich.edu/special/exoneration/Documents/Exonerations_in_2015.pdf\" class=\"story-body__link-external\">\"conviction integrity units\"</a>, or \"a division of a prosecutorial office that works to prevent, identify and correct false convictions\", have quadrupled. Some have set up screening committees to vet certain types of cases, like a prosecutor in New York state who decided that any case that relied on single eyewitness identification automatically warrants special attention.</p>\n<p>However, most remedies become available after defendants have already spent a significant amount of time behind bars. That was the conclusion of Jim Piper, first assistant state's attorney for St Clair County, when he found himself listening to a radio story about the highly lauded conviction integrity unit in Brooklyn, New York, while getting the oil in his car changed one day in 2013.</p>\n<p>\"So many cases had been overturned where young men had been sitting in jail for years and years before someone got around to vetting the prosecution,\" he recalls. \"It occurred to me - why are we doing that at the end? Why don't we have a procedure in place on the front end to vet prosecutions before they can become a conviction?\"</p>\n<p>St Clair County is an interesting laboratory for such an experiment. A county with a population of about 280,000, it encompasses the city of East St Louis, which at one time led the nation with its murder rate and has struggled since the 1970s with joblessness, drugs and violent crime. There are 32 arresting agencies of all sizes within the county - from a single part-time officer in Summerfield to the 1,700-officer Illinois State Police - who police everything from the urban industrial riverfront on the western border to the corn fields on the eastern edge. It has its share of official corruption. Kelly has charged 13 police officers in the county with various crimes, everything from theft of evidence to battering a suspect to forcing a woman to perform oral sex at a traffic stop.</p>\n<p>\"We have every kind of case you can think of,\" says Kelly, who grew up in the area.</p>\n<p>Around the time that Piper was getting that fateful oil change, the St Clair County state's attorney had three cases on his plate where defence lawyers genuinely believed their clients could be innocent. This is an anomaly - typically, defendants will challenge evidence, or request a lesser charge, but few claim to be actually innocent.</p>\n<p>In response, Kelly and Piper authored a simple protocol: If a defendant, their counsel or anyone else associated with the case brought forward compelling reasons to believe that the defendant was innocent, the defendant would be allowed to take a polygraph or a voice-stress test. Piper says that though they know these kinds of tests can be unreliable, being confronted with the chance to take one can filter out disingenuous defendants. Regardless of the results of the test - which are inadmissible at trial due to issues with the reliability of the technology - the assistant state's attorney (ASA) in charge of the case would also perform a \"de novo\" or \"from the beginning\" review of all the evidence. </p>\n<p>\"The ASA shall confirm that no other probative forensic testing can be conducted and that no other witnesses can be identified and interviewed,\" the protocol reads. \"At the end of this review, if both the ASA and supervising ASA(s) either no longer believe there exists a moral certainty of the defendant's guilt or believe there no longer exists a reasonable likelihood of conviction, then the case shall be dismissed without prejudice.\" </p>\n<p>One of the first tests of the programme was a murder case. Rodney Lewis admitted he stabbed 18-year-old Michael Barton Jr, but always maintained that it was in self defence. He passed his polygraph, and after re-examining the evidence, the assistant state's attorney dropped the charges. After 414 days in the St Clair County jail, he went home. </p>\n<p>\"I think it was his mother who went and picked him up,\" says Lewis' lawyer, Thomas Keefe III. \"She was very, very happy.\"</p>\n<p>Each of the nine cases has a different set of circumstances that led to charges being filed and ultimately dropped. Eyewitnesses identified the wrong perpetrators. Co-defendants implicated friends or acquaintances who were never there. In one case of an armed robbery of a mobile phone, the defendant falsely confessed after he says he was pressured by investigators. </p>\n<p>\"I thought I was going to jail anyway, so, I just said I did it,\" <a href=\"http://www.bnd.com/news/local/article55051595.html\" class=\"story-body__link-external\">he told the Belleville-News Democrat</a>, which broke the news of the programme. \"But I didn't know anything about it.\"</p>\n<p>So far, Kelly says just one claim that was investigated under the protocol actually yielded more evidence of the defendants' guilt, bolstering the state's case - a natural check, he believes, on the programme being abused.</p>\n<p>Some have pointed out that vetting cases before trial is a basic tenet of the work of a prosecutor, that Kelly's protocol just codifies what he is supposed to be doing anyway. If that's the case, the revolutionary step seems to be a simple willingness to publicly admit defendants were charged erroneously.</p>\n<p>\"I was honestly kind of surprised that they came forward and said, 'We dumped these [cases] because of actual innocence,'\" says Cathy MacElroy, a defence lawyer who has had two clients exonerated under the protocol.</p>\n<p>Kelly claims there have been no complaints from police about the programme, and he wants people to know that even though officers may initially arrest the wrong person, it is good police work that can correct an error as well.</p>\n<p>\"It's an imperfect world. We have good people in law enforcement and good people in the criminal justice system and good people as witnesses, but they can all make mistakes.\"</p>\n<p>In 19-year-old Brandon Jackson's case, it was the work of defence lawyers that ultimately cleared him. Another teenager implicated Jackson in a plot to lure a tattoo artist who made house calls to an abandoned home, and rob him of his money and equipment. When two of the perpetrators eventually took plea deals, they independently admitted that Jackson had nothing to do with the robbery.</p>\n<p>Still, Jackson - and other wrongfully charged individuals - has a hard time feeling grateful. He was 17 at the time of his arrest, and after spending months both in a juvenile detention centre then on house arrest, he couldn't graduate from high school. Now he lives at home with his mother and works in a warehouse. </p>\n<p>\"It was very stressful when I was locked up. I didn't know when I was coming home. When you get arrested for nothing, you don't know what is going on. Then they're offering you years of your life for nothing,\" he says. \"It took a whole year off my life.\"</p>\n<p><strong>More from the BBC on US criminal justice</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24119398\" class=\"story-body__link\">Why does Wisconsin send so many black people to jail?</a> - The state that locks up the highest percentage of black men</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-34705968\" class=\"story-body__link\">The US inmates charged per night in jail</a> - Reversing a widespread practice known as \"pay to stay\"</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-33681160\" class=\"story-body__link\">Why is it so hard to hire black police officers?</a> - One department's effort to diversify</p>\n<p>Then there's the fact that he had to pay the county $5 per day while he was on an ankle monitor, plus the cost of a landline to carry the monitor's signal. For his mother Ommie, a double amputee who lives on a fixed income, these were not trivial expenses, nor was hiring a private attorney. She says they're still paying their legal bill in instalments. </p>\n<p>Detavius McGary, who was accused of and then exonerated of charges that he robbed an elderly woman at gunpoint, spent 75 days in jail, then also had to pay a per diem fee for a year of ankle monitoring. His mother says she knows her son was lucky to have the chance to prove his innocence, but that she is now \"completely broke\". McGary says he wanted to sue the county but can't find a lawyer to take the case. And there were other costs.</p>\n<p>\"When they had me, I couldn't really see my kids,\" McGary says. \"I had so many good job opportunities, [but] then people, they weren't accepting me because of the case. I ain't really all the way recovered.\"</p>\n<p>Moreland's landlord attempted to evict her family over the arrest, until her defence lawyer Kristi Flint wrote a letter explaining the situation. Flint says that clients like Moreland are lucky that they could afford to bond out - a more indigent client who is actually innocent might have just pleaded guilty in order to get out of jail. Six of the nine defendants spent over a month in jail - the longest was Lewis' 414 days.</p>\n<p>\"I think that it is admirable that Brendan has put this out here as, 'Yes, innocent people get charged and when they do, you know, we dismiss it,'\" says Flint. \"But my question is, OK, so what do we do after this? What is he doing with this information? Lashonda is out money, the stresses that she went through - there's no making her whole.\"</p>\n<p>In his cluttered office on the second floor of the St Clair County courthouse - a map of East St Louis with violent crimes, usually gun violence, marked with red stickers in one corner - Kelly admits that his protocol is an experiment, one he can't guarantee will be successful. </p>\n<p>\"I think we're going to review it every year and just see how it's going. The public defenders, the prosecutors are in the trenches every day and we get continuous feedback,\" he says.</p>\n<p>Currently, the St Clair County state's attorney's office is looking at two new possible cases of actual innocence - this time cases of alleged sexual abuse of a child. </p>\n<p>Kelly does not think being open to admitting law enforcement mistakes makes him soft on crime. He considers himself an \"aggressive\" prosecutor who believes in law enforcement and its role in bringing about the precipitous decline in crime in the US since the 1990s. In his first year in office, he doubled the number of charges filed, though he sent many of those cases to drug and mental health courts. It's a line he says he walks because he believes there is no \"criminal justice without social justice\".</p>\n<p>\"Your local DA is accountable not to some person who appointed them in DC, or some state capitol somewhere, but is accountable to the people that they serve,\" he says. \"I think the prosecutor has the ability to be uniquely part of the solution, because again, we're the one entity whose duty is first and foremost to justice.\"</p>\n<p><i>Subscribe to the </i><a href=\"https://ssl.bbc.co.uk/newsletters/newsmagazine?ptrt=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine\" class=\"story-body__link\">BBC News Magazine's email newsletter</a><i> to get articles sent to your inbox. </i></p>"

			"title": "BBC How four men survived as hostages of IS",
			"date_published": 1461106854,
			"body": "\n<p class=\"story-body__introduction\">In his classic novel 1984, George Orwell writes about Room 101 - a torture chamber where you are subjected to your worst nightmare, the worst thing in the world, to break your resistance. </p>\n<p>To survive any such place of profound pain is the greatest of gifts, a triumph of the human spirit. In our time, surviving brutal captivity at the hands of so-called Islamic State in Syria must certainly count as such a triumph. </p>\n<p>When four former hostages came together this month for their first reunion since they were freed, at different times, two years ago, it was a celebration of friendship forged in the most threatening of circumstances, a remembrance of an agonising ordeal.</p>\n<p>In the BBC radio programme Held Hostage in Syria they recall months without sunlight, weeks chained together, days upon days of beatings. There was too little food, and so much longing for clean clothes, a proper toilet, and most of all, freedom.</p>\n<p>But it was also an affirmation of extraordinary resilience. They had all won what they call a \"game of survival\" which lasted about one long terrible year of torment for all of them.</p>\n<p>They played this game in their own individual ways to preserve themselves, and some semblance of human dignity. Federico Motka, an Italian aid worker, lowered his gaze and raised his guard to avoid his captors' efforts to demean him. French war correspondent Didier Francois pushed back and stared them straight in the eye. Danish photographer Daniel Rye Ottosen, an elite gymnast, did the splits to convince them he was not a spy.  French blogger Pierre Torres took beatings, but satisfaction, from ignoring their orders. </p>\n<p>And they played this game together, helping each other endure their ordeal, as IS guards of different nationalities deployed diverse tactics of physical and psychological torture to try to break them. Only one, Daniel Rye, was subjected to such brutality that he tried to take his own life - but the guards stopped him, and his fellow hostages brought him back to health. </p>\n<p>There were real games too: chess, with pieces fashioned from cheese cartons with nail clippers; draughts (checkers), with the seeds of olives and dates; a self-styled lecture series on everything from carp fishing, to sailing, and how to dive into a small pool. This is how they escaped in their mind.</p>\n<p>At one point in 2013-2014 19 men carrying a Western or a Russian passport were held hostage together in one small room. An adjacent room was a cell for five women. One by one, they have been freed for ransom or executed. Of this group of male hostages only one, British journalist John Cantlie, is left and one woman whose name has not been made public. </p>\n<p>Several journalists and aid workers, and hundreds of Syrians, have not lived to tell of their ordeal. We know of their fate from grotesque videos on social media which have brought a sickening cinematic slickness to medieval beheadings.</p>\n<p>These are the stories of four men who went to Syria to report on a punishing war, or to try to ease suffering in this humanitarian crisis of our time. They all went to help in some way. They all found themselves in a living hell.</p>\n<p>In our studio, they return to the dark, dreadful rooms they escaped two years ago. At moments they struggle to find the right words. At moments, they still can't draw them out. There's deep sorrow, but also smiles. \"When we meet,\" reflects Didier Francois, \"we can share things that we can't share with anyone else… it's important.\"</p>\n<p>What they can share with us is a compelling chronicle of our time. </p>\n<p>DIDIER: The way it happened was very fast. I crossed the border in the morning, around 10:30am, and by 11am I was caught. As soon as you crossed from Turkey into Syria, the trap was already closing in. There was one car behind us and another in front, five guys came out and it was all very professional. There was no way to escape. They took our glasses off, they took our shoes off so we couldn't run away, we were blindfolded and they took our phones away. After this, you put yourself in survival mode immediately.</p>\n<p>PIERRE: I graduated as an oceanographer, but in 2011 I was captivated with the Arab Spring. I was very interested in the city of Raqqa. It's now the self-declared capital of the Islamic State, but at that time, it was the first capital freed from the Assad regime… On the day I got caught, I was just two minutes from my friend's house, where I was staying. A car stopped to the left of me and four or five people were in it wearing ski masks. But at that time in Raqqa, that wasn't a scary sight. It was normal to see people in a car wearing ski masks in the middle of the afternoon. I just thought, \"Oh maybe they're just going to ask me what the time is.\" But then I saw the barrels of the pistols they were holding and realised it was something else. They started to punch me like hell from everywhere with the guns and the barrels of the guns. At one point I began to collapse and I saw that the top of the car was covered in blood. I then realised that the blood was coming from my head.</p>\n<p>FEDERICO: I was with David Haines [the British aid worker] in the car. We had just spent the day talking to community groups. We went to Atma camp just on the border and then we got back in the car and started driving to our safe house. I was actually on the phone with my boss at the time and didn't notice anything until there were suddenly two black cars around us. One in front and one behind. About eight fighters piled out of it and there was a lot of shouting. I just dropped my phone on to the seat next to me - which still had my boss on the other end of the line. In a blur, you just get pulled out of the car and put down on the floor. I remember there was a man on a bike just cycling past with a look on his face that just said, \"Oh crap.\" Then we were put into the boot of a car - but it didn't close properly so they took us out and put us back in again. Then we just sped off.</p>\n<p>DANIEL: The guard said to me \"Daniel, why do you have such wide shoulders? You look like a guy from the army or something.\" And I said, \"No, no, I'm not. I'm a former elite gymnast. That's why I look the way I do.\" And he replied, \"But that's why some of the other guards think that you're a spy.\" That was when I first got really scared. I tried to show him that I wasn't a spy, and that I really was a gymnast by doing the splits there and then on the mattress. And this guy was saying, \"Stop doing that. I'm supposed to interrogate you. I'm supposed to torture you.\" Then some other guys came down and they started to yell at me, shout at me and punch me. Many of the foreign fighters - the European or Western fighters that came - tended to be a bit more aggressive towards us. At some point, I remember they came in and they took me up, and I had to dance some kind of tango. That was really strange because you really felt like you were humiliated.   </p>\n<p>DIDIER: The difficult thing when you lose your freedom is that there are no rules. You are outside the rule of law. The guards are the ones who make the decisions and you've lost all your control. So the only thing you can keep for yourself is your dignity. You have to understand that they all had one objective - to keep us under their thumb. There were no nice guards or good guards - all of them were bad. But their strategies to control us as a group were different. Some resorted to extreme violence and others used more sophisticated tactics. The French guards were more into playing games with our minds, while the British were more into a direct approach - control and violence. And we never knew which method would be used. They came on a regular basis to beat you up with no reason, to show you that they are in charge. They put some pepper spray on my blindfold. There was no water and no food for four days. </p>\n<p>PIERRE: I had a massive guilt complex at one stage and it was bothering me all the time. I actually felt like I had accepted some things too easily and I wanted to be able to fight and struggle. So at one stage, I targeted a very young guard - I think he was from Tunisia. I stood in front of him and made direct eye contact. Those guards were so sensitive to body language and eye contact. So I stood in front of him very proud, and with my eyes I was saying, \"You're a piece of shit.\"… Then at one stage, that guard wanted to punch me. He came up to me holding a stick, and he tried to take me down with it, but I stood up. A few minutes later, he came back and he was so angry. He was really out of control. He took me away from the jail where I was and beat the crap out of me with the stick. Then he took me back to the cell with the others, and I was suffering a lot all over my body. He'd also punched me in the stomach so I had shit on my pants. But I was euphoric. It was like taking cocaine or something. I was feeling so great. I loved that moment and really appreciated it. It was worth it. </p>\n<p>DANIEL: I tried to focus on all the bright things in my situation. I started counting a lot, talking to myself, and started making up projects in my head. I think the survival mode that you go into when you're by yourself is very interesting. It's really, really difficult. You're just there with your brain, and yourself.  I could have good times when I thought everything seemed fine, and I could have bad times. When I look back now, I had different states of mind. I had the shock at the beginning. The second part was about accepting and adapting. The third part was thinking that this was my everyday life. This is when you become a good hostage. And for me, this is actually when the time started to go by faster. There was a point when I thought, \"I will not survive.\" I tried to escape and I tried to hang myself and I was rescued by the bad guys. They came in and they took me down and everything was OK, and I really felt that they would not kill me. But my point is that I went through that and suddenly I came to a new sense of self where the situation was completely different. </p>\n<p>FEDERICO: We were split up, me and Dave [David Haines]. Dave had given me three pieces of advice which I will never forget: always tell the truth; if we get split up make a routine; and play the game. They took me out and drove me off to another place, just a completely black cell with a toilet, and for about three weeks - nothing. Days and days of solitude. I would pace up and down and do these things like chatting to my parents and my sister in my head and try to sleep again. Anything to pass the days. We only really became a group with the other hostages much later on, at the end of July. Our only ability to keep dignity was to try to keep as clean as you could. But we were going through a routine of having our hands cuffed behind our back at night and our hands cuffed in front during the day. On some occasions when they told us that we smelt too bad, the handcuffs would be taken off so we could take our T-shirts off and wash our armpits with a little bit of water. That was for me the way to maintain dignity… I'd been wearing the same clothes that I'd had on that afternoon that we got caught up right until July - even longer than that actually. I just took every opportunity whenever I went to the toilet to wash them in water. It was my obsession.</p>\n<p>DIDIER: This cloth is a cotton scarf in which I had hidden some chess pieces, made from Vache Qui Rit cheese boxes. We played chess a lot.</p>\n<p>PIERRE: We organised lectures, we organised sport and we organised games. </p>\n<p>FEDERICO: We used blankets to make a boat on the ground and I then tried to explain with my very limited physics how sails work and boats go faster. Alan Henning gave a lecture on carp fishing I think. </p>\n<p>[Pierre gave a lecture on how to make iron. Daniel gave a lecture on diving from a high board into a small pool.]</p>\n<p>DANIEL: I remember my brain was thirsty. It wanted any information no matter what it was, as long as it was somebody talking about something from the real world.</p>\n<p>FEDERICO: There was another game that we did that was really great - we did versions of Werewolf, also called Mafia. Whoever was narrating created the plot and then handed out characters and then people had to behave in that way. We had prima donnas and a prostitute at one point. </p>\n<p>DIDIER: We were obsessed with food - that was a long part of every discussion. Every night we tried to imagine a menu with the \"non-dessert of the day\". So it was the non-menu and a non-dessert that we would never get. When I got out, the first meal given to me was from the French intelligence team who were part of the army. It was when I was on the military plane, they opened the cans of cassoulet with beers. That was great. </p>\n<p>DANIEL: I think the whole time the hostages and I were sitting inside together, we shared the same dream of crossing the border together. That wherever we were, we would go to a hotel together and there would be a buffet. We spoke a lot about that buffet, and how 19 guys would sit around the table and share it together. A day that should be a very happy day; crossing the border, going into freedom and going back to our families. And there was still some part of me staying behind in Syria saying, \"It's only the end when all of us can sit around this table and eat our buffet.\"</p>\n<p>DIDIER: I think among all the hostages, we still have a strong bond. You can't live what we went through without keeping something. Even the bad parts of it. When we meet we share things that you cannot share with anyone else. It's very important.</p>\n<p>PIERRE: Some of us were coming out of really tough experiences, we all had difficulties and we were all such different characters, but we really teamed up with each other. We built up something very strong between us.</p>\n<p>FEDERICO: I had received a proof-of-life question - the colour of the bedroom wall in my mum's house is orange. It was one of the most bittersweet moments of my life. Up until then I had to believe that David [Haines] and I would be released together and that was the moment that I realised it wasn't happening and I cried like a baby. Dave was sitting next to me and he hugged me and everyone was really nice. They said, \"Take this chance.\" David knew by then that things weren't looking great. My proof of life meant his loss of a certain level of hope.</p>\n<p>[David Haines was beheaded in September 2014, four months after Federico was released.]</p>\n<p>DANIEL: When I was released, we were eight guys left - me and a German guy, and three Brits and three Americans. I got my proof of life, then the German guy got his proof of life a few days later. At that point it was very clear that they were not negotiating for the Americans and the Brits. The day that I was released, I was sitting in a corner and I was crying, early in the morning, all by myself just with a blanket over my head not to show the other guys that I was nervous. And then James [Foley] came over to me, put his arm over my shoulders and said, \"Don't worry, they will probably come in 10 or 15 minutes, and you will be on your way home, and just enjoy it. You really earned your freedom.\"</p>\n<p><i>Subscribe to the </i><a href=\"https://ssl.bbc.co.uk/newsletters/newsmagazine?ptrt=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine\" class=\"story-body__link\">BBC News Magazine's email newsletter</a><i> to get articles sent to your inbox.</i></p>"

But the evidence pointed to them not being afraid to use guns themselves to expand their influence. </p>\n<p>\"They wanted to move up in the criminal world from regional to international gangsters. The group was motivated by profit, so we can only speculate that some of these weapons would have been sold to whoever had the means to pay the asking price.\"</p>\n<p>After Shilling and Defraine were found guilty of conspiring to import and sell the weapons, the judge, Mr Justice Topolski, told them they both faced the possibility of life sentences.</p>\n<p>\"Criminals like you at or near the top of criminal organisations invariably pose a serious danger to the public,\" he said. </p>\n<p>A life sentence would come in for \"serious consideration\", he added.</p>\n<p>David Payne, 43, Richard Rye, 24, and Christopher Owen, 30, had already pleaded guilty to smuggling the weapons into the country. </p>\n<p>Payne and Rye also admitted the second count relating to conspiracy to sell the arsenal.</p>\n<p>All five will be sentenced on 13 May. </p>\n<p>The guns - 22 assault rifles similar to AK-47s, and nine Skorpion sub-machine guns - were brought into the UK from Boulogne on a 38ft (12m) cruiser, the MV Albernina, the court heard.</p>\n<p>All had originally been deactivated but were reactivated before they, along with a large amount of ammunition, were smuggled up the Medway into Kent, arriving near Cuxton Marina on 10 August last year.</p>\n<p>But detectives had the plotters under surveillance and swooped to seize the cache before it could be buried and then sold, the court heard.</p>\n<p>The court heard each of the 22 Czech-made assault rifles would have fetched up to £4,000, even though they were sold at \"shockingly low\" prices in Eastern Europe.</p>\n<p>The Skorpion machine guns, originally developed for use by Czech special forces, would have netted £3,500 apiece.</p>\n<p>On 11 August, the gang was seen by investigators unloading the cruiser, the jury was told, and a number of large heavy bags were loaded into a white van which was driven away by Payne. </p>\n<p>Shilling and Defraine were arrested outside a branch of the DIY store Homebase, where they had just bought spades and other tools, the court heard.</p>"

			"title": "BBC The strange way people looked at food in the 16th Century",
			"date_published": 1461150898,
			"body": "\n<p class=\"story-body__introduction\">It may seem a peculiarly 21st Century preoccupation, but people in Shakespeare's England were also obsessed with food, writes Dr Joan Fitzpatrick. </p>\n<p>The 16th Century had plenty of diet books. </p>\n<p>Andrew Boorde's Compendious Regiment (1542) warns against eating and drinking to excess and often remarks upon the behaviour and diet of English people, noting that the English spend too long sitting at dinner and supper, feeding on heavy meats before lighter ones, which isn't good for their digestion. </p>\n<p>William Bullein's Government of Health (1558) takes the form of a dialogue between John, a self-confessed glutton, and Humphrey, a man of moderate habits. </p>\n<p>In Sir John Falstaff, Shakespeare's notorious glutton, we're presented with a character who defies both dietary and religious authorities by eating and drinking to excess whenever he pleases. </p>\n<p>It was generally believed that eating meat was divinely ordained and the dietary authors promoted meat as more healthy than a vegetarian diet, although it had to be considered whether or not a specific meat was suited to one's \"humour\", occupation, and even nationality. </p>\n<p>For example, bacon was thought fitting only for labourers or those involved in physical activity because it was difficult to digest and vigorous work would help this process. </p>\n<p>Chicken was regarded more favourably and was specifically recommended by some as a food for the sick, but it was expensive in Shakespeare's time so only the wealthy would eat the bird's flesh. </p>\n<p>In Shakespeare, capons are an indulgence - they are a favourite of Sir John Falstaff , and in The Two Gentlemen of Verona Launce's dog Crab steals a capon-leg from Sylvia's table. </p>\n<p>Boorde thought that beef was \"good meate for an English man\", a view that disagreed with ancient medical authorities such as Galen who believed that beef was a cold and heavy meat that provoked melancholy. </p>\n<p>It was thought that the cold English climate made English stomachs hotter than those of their Mediterranean neighbours and so better able to digest a meat like beef, which was also more tender in England as the cattle fed on pasture. </p>\n<p>In Shakespeare's time beef was thought to stir up courage, something emphasised by classical philosophers and evident in Henry V when the French Constable says of the English soldiers \"give them great meals of beef, and iron and steel, they will eat like wolves and fight like devils\". </p>\n<p>On the other hand, it was believed that beef caused stupidity, something Shakespeare refers to twice - in Twelfth Night when Andrew Aguecheek observes \"Methinks sometimes I have no more wit than a Christian or an ordinary man has; but I am a great eater of beef, and I believe that does harm to my wit\", and in Troilus and Cressida when Ajax curses Thersites: \"The plague of Greece upon thee, thou mongrel beef-witted lord!\" </p>\n<p>Beef might be served in pies, which the English were especially fond of. They also liked pasties, like today's, enclosed in a pastry crust and baked without a dish, which usually had only one filling, venison being a popular choice. </p>\n<p>In The Merry Wives of Windsor Master Page offers a venison pasty to Slender and Sir John Falstaff for dinner. The Lenten pie referred to by Mercutio in Romeo and Juliet wouldn't have contained any meat because Lent was a time for fasting and fish would have taken the place of meat at the dinner table.</p>\n<p>These days we are generally encouraged by health professionals to eat more fish and reduce our intake of red meat but in Shakespeare's time fish was considered inferior to meat. People viewed it as less nourishing, but it was also associated with the Catholic practice of not eating meat on Fridays. </p>\n<p>\"Fish days\" had been introduced by the government for economic reasons, to encourage the fishing industry and bring down the high price of meat, but the fish days were disliked by England's Protestants because they reminded them of England's Catholic past. </p>\n<p>In King Lear the disguised Kent says to Lear: \"I do profess to be no less than I seem, to serve him truly that will put me in trust, to love him that is honest, to converse with him that is wise and says little, to fear judgement, to fight when I cannot choose, and to eat no fish.\" </p>\n<p>This all suggests that Kent is a loyal Protestant and therefore a man who can be trusted. In Shakespeare's Henry IV part 2 Falstaff criticises Hal's sober brother, Prince John. \"There's never none of these demure boys come to any proof; for thin drink doth so overcool their blood, and making many fish meals, that they fall into a kind of male green-sickness; and then when they marry, they get wenches.\" </p>\n<p>\"Green sickness\" was an anaemic disease commonly attributed to a virgin's sexual fantasies that could be cured by a sexual encounter, and by the phrase \"get wenches\" Falstaff means \"produce girl children\". In other words, Falstaff is suggesting that Prince John is weak and effeminate because he is not properly nourished. </p>\n<p>However, Falstaff himself eats fish - a receipt in his pocket shows he has enjoyed \"anchovies and sack [Spanish white wine] after supper\". Anchovies and also herring, preserved in salt or pickled, were commonly sold as snacks in taverns, which would explain why they bother Sir Toby Belch in Twelfth Night (\"A plague o' these pickle herring!\"). While eating fish occasionally or as a snack was fine (at least acceptable to someone like Falstaff), to eat \"many fish meals\" was suspiciously Catholic.</p>\n<p>Animal flesh was preferred over fish and also considered healthier than \"fruit\", a term that included not only what we consider fruit today but also what we consider vegetables. Fruit was believed to be full of water that could cause a harmful imbalance in the body. It was generally believed that before the biblical Flood the human constitution was stronger and fruits contained less moisture but that after the Flood fruit provided less nourishment and made men more vulnerable to disease. </p>\n<p>It was believed to be at this point that God ordained the consumption of animal flesh by humans. Dietary authors advised eating fruit only occasionally, and before meals, avoiding the French habit of eating it after meals (for dessert). </p>\n<p>This is a shortened version of Joan Fitzpatrick's talk, \"'Wolf All?' Shakespeare and Food in Renaissance England,\" for Radio 3's <strong>The Essay</strong>, to be broadcast at 22:45 BST on 27 April - <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006x3hl\" class=\"story-body__link\">catch up on BBC iPlayer</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/timelines/z8k2p39\" class=\"story-body__link\">BBC iWonder - William Shakespeare: The Life and Legacy of England's Bard</a></p>\n<p>But people still ate fruit, which was sold in the streets and markets and picked from bushes and in hedgerows by those who could not afford to buy it or be fussy about what they ate. </p>\n<p>New and fashionable fruits, such as apricots and melons, were being imported into England from southern Europe and dried fruits such as raisins and figs were also available to those who could afford them. </p>\n<p>Pumpkin seeds have been found in excavations of the Rose and Globe playhouses and so it's possible that pumpkins or pumpkin seeds were consumed by wealthier members of the audience. Pumpkins were considered especially watery - in The Merry Wives of Windsor Mistress Ford describes Falstaff as \"this unwholesome humidity, this gross watery pumpkin\". </p>\n<p>For modern readers one of the strangest ideas to emerge from early modern dietary books is the fact that human breast-milk was recommended as a drink for adults as well as children. </p>\n<p>Bullein claims \"the best milk that helpeth against consumptions is woman's milk\". When we recognise this, references to milk and milkiness in the plays begin to make more sense. </p>\n<p>Lady Macbeth worries that her husband is \"too full o' th' milk of human kindness\". The line is clearly figurative, but might there be a literal suggestion too? </p>\n<p>These accusations of milkiness suggest two kinds of weakness - the producers of milk were weak because they were women, and the consumers were the weak, the old, the sick, or babies. </p>\n<p>Milk from animals and other \"white meats\", such as butter and cheese, were usually manufactured by women and they evoked distinct national stereotypes, butter being especially associated with the Dutch and cheese with the Welsh. </p>\n<p>Boorde recommends that butter be eaten \"in the morning before other meats\" (or foods), noting that \"French men will eat it after meat\" and \"Dutch men doth eat it at all times in the day\". </p>\n<p>In The Merry Wives of Windsor Master Ford claims he wouldn't trust a Fleming with his butter but most of the references to butter in this play and in Henry IV part 1 are made by or about Falstaff. In The Merry Wives of Windsor Sir Hugh Evans, conforms to stereotype by looking forward to a dessert of cheese: \"I will make an end of my dinner; there's pippins and cheese to come\". </p>\n<p>Pippins, a variety of apple, were considered difficult to digest, especially if eaten raw and cheese was thought helpful to close the stomach after a meal. Cheese was traditionally a food for the poor but after 1600 it became more fashionable, especially hard cheese that took more time to mature and was imported from abroad.  </p>\n<p>In Shakespeare's time people thought that sugar was healthy, indeed it was used as a medicine to treat lots of conditions such as stomach problems. Boorde approved of all food and drink containing sugar as especially nutritious and it was thought that old people craved sugar.</p>\n<p>Like our ancestors we too believe that some foods are better for us than others, even if we wouldn't agree with them about what those foods are. But we also share with our ancestors the belief that good health, above all other things, is what matters most. </p>\n<p>This year marks 400 years since William Shakespeare's death.

			"body": "\n<p class=\"story-body__introduction\">William Shakespeare may be widely regarded as finest playwright in the English language, but when he put his quill down he was also a savvy businessman.</p>\n<p>In Elizabethan London, the original Globe Theatre could accommodate 3,000 people. Commoners or \"groundlings\" paid a penny to stand in the open air, while the gentry parted with as many as six pennies to sit on cushions in the covered galleries.</p>\n<p>Notwithstanding the fact that the Globe burned down in 1613, Shakespeare's share in the playhouse made him a tidy fortune.</p>\n<p>He also part-owned another London theatre and a production company. And back in his hometown of Stratford-upon-Avon in Warwickshire, he invested widely in land and property, and reportedly bought and sold grain.</p>\n<p>By the time Shakespeare died on 23 April 1616 - 400 years ago on Saturday - he was a very wealthy man. In today's money he would have comfortably been a millionaire.</p>\n<p>Fast-forward four centuries, and Shakespeare would likely be rather pleased that his work and legacy continues to support a large and lucrative industry, which is far from being limited to the sale of theatre tickets and employment of actors.</p>\n<p>Instead, Shakespeare supports a substantially wider business community - from hotels and restaurants in Stratford, to walking tours in London, bars near a balcony in the Italian city of Verona, sales of books and memorabilia, and even leadership classes for businessmen and women. </p>\n<p>It is definitely not much ado about nothing.</p>\n<p>Piers Ibbotson says there are so many lessons from Shakespeare about the perils and pitfalls of power that it has provided him with an inexhaustible fund of material for his management and leadership workshops over the past two decades.</p>\n<p>\"The plays of Shakespeare are case studies for central human dilemmas,\" says the 61-year-old, who is part of Warwick Business School's Create unit.</p>\n<p>\"The plays are so rich, and so complex, that there are actual situations to examine. Acting things out is very powerful, people can physically get inside situations.\"</p>\n<p>Create uses Shakespeare's plays to guide students, and business clients, through numerous difficult business situations.</p>\n<p>Macbeth, for example, is viewed as a study into the limits of ambition, while The Tempest is seen as a metaphor for a perfect storm of workplace rivalry.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, A Midsummer Night's Dream is used to explore business transformation, and the Merchant of Venice teaches contract enforcement.</p>\n<p>Mr Ibbotson says: \"Shakespeare is such a wonderful asset and of course you're always using such powerful language -  it allows people to articulate much more subtle and complex ideas than thin business language.\"</p>\n<p>Richard Olivier, 54, is another person who uses Shakespeare's plays to teach good leadership and business practice.</p>\n<p>The son of Sir Laurence Olivier, the UK's most famous 20th Century Shakespearian actor, Mr Olivier says: \"Shakespeare is an amazing ethical teacher.</p>\n<p>\"Apart from the history plays, there is no play where the bad guy ends up in charge at the end.\"</p>\n<p>Clients of Mr Olivier's company Olivier Mythodrama have included NHS management, the Metropolitan Police and Daimler-Benz. His charges range from £5,000 for a half-day session to as much as £40,000 for a six-day intensive course.</p>\n<p>Mr Olivier adds: \"There's huge drama in leadership, and Shakespeare was probably the first playwright to portray the human drama of leadership in three-dimensional form.\"</p>\n<p>The area known as Shakespeare's England (which takes in the towns of Stratford, Royal Leamington Spa, Kenilworth and Warwick) received 9.94 million tourists in 2014, according to the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust, the charity that cares for Shakespeare heritage sites.</p>\n<p>It adds that the total value of tourism to the local economy is in the region of £635m, which supports some 11,150 jobs.</p>\n<p>Alisan Cole, from the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust, says: \"2014, the 450th anniversary of Shakespeare's birth, was our record year with 820,000 visitors, and we're expecting 2016 to be on a par with it, if not exceed it.\"</p>\n<p>In terms of attracting hungry and thirsty tourists, Hathaway Cafe is perfectly positioned in the centre of Stratford, and is just a short walk from the Royal Shakespeare Theatre.</p>\n<p>Manager and owner Rick Allen, 51, says that during the summer the warren-like Tudor-era teashop is packed with Asian customers, typically from China and Taiwan, playing £13 a head for afternoon tea (or £18 with a glass of prosecco).</p>\n<p>\"Off-peak we get around 1,000 customers per week, but it's well over 2,000 per week during the peak season of July and August,\" he says.</p>\n<p>Mr Allen adds that Birmingham Airport's new runway extension, which caters for the growing number of flights from East Asia, has been a fillip for the business.</p>\n<p>\"We're literally getting calls from people saying 'we've got a booking for 24 and we're on our way'. In August it's mayhem - good fun, but mayhem.\"</p>\n<p>Down in London former actor Declan McHugh, 55, has been taking people on Shakespeare-themed guided walks since 1999.</p>\n<p>He says his business - Shakespeare in the City Walk - has grown thanks to positive word of mouth, and good reviews on websites such as TripAdvisor.</p>\n<p>Mr McHugh adds that London is a rich seam for Shakespeare fans since the playwright spent most of his working life moving through the then murky and bohemian world of the Elizabethan city's playhouses.</p>\n<p>Charging £10 per adult, he says the Shakespeare anniversary year is shaping up as a record one for his business.</p>\n<p>\"I've been doing this for 17 years and I'm starting to reap the rewards,\" he says.</p>\n<p>While he says it's hard to give exact numbers, he normally gets between five and 10 people meeting him outside Blackfriars underground station every Friday at 11am. But that's just for the public walks.</p>\n<p>\"Then I also do regular walks privately for colleges and universities from across the globe, plus there's UK institutions and businesses. I have the Girl Guides coming next Monday, for example.</p>\n<p>\"Private walks usually are for 15-20 people but I have done the tour for 60 people before,\" he says.</p>\n<p>Mr McHugh says his fascination for Shakespeare began at 11 years old, and now he regards the Bard as pretty much \"his guardian angel\".</p>"

			"body": "\n<p class=\"story-body__introduction\">A record number of people have applied to join the French police force over the past year. Many new recruits say the recent attacks in Paris inspired them to sign up. It also seems that the shootings have made the country rethink its attitude towards the police.</p>\n<p>A young recruit pushes away a woman charging at her with a club. The recruit draws her revolver. \"Police! Don't move!\" she yells. </p>\n<p>Audrey is taking part in a self-defence class at the police training school in Sens, eastern France, having signed up after gunmen attacked the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo and a Jewish supermarket at the start of 2015.  </p>\n<p>\"Since the [Paris] terror attacks in January and November last year, the danger confronting us is clear,\" she says. \"Any one of us can be a victim. Every one of us needs protection. And we all want to help somehow. That's why I'm here. To help make this country safer.\" </p>\n<p>In March this year, a record 35,000 people sat the exam to join the police - 50% more than last year. </p>\n<p>Only 8% of those who took the test passed - the same success level as for the entrance exam for the elite Science-Po political science school in Paris.  </p>\n<p>\"I was really shocked by the video from the Charlie Hebdo killings of the policeman who was on the ground, asking for mercy, who they shot in cold blood,\" says another recruit, Perez, when I ask him why he joined the police.  </p>\n<p>\"That made me want to defend our republic, defend our nation even more. In the morning we'll wake up and know that maybe today we'll risk our lives but we're more motivated than ever,\" he says.  </p>\n<p>The policeman Perez is talking about was called Ahmed Merabet, and the next recruit I talk to shares the same first name. </p>\n<p>\"I'm of Algerian origin,\" he says. \"We had a lot of terrorism in Algeria when I was growing up. I remember the curfews when we went there on holiday. When the Bataclan happened in November I remembered Algeria, and in December I joined the police.\"</p>\n<p>Three of the victims in the Charlie Hebdo and kosher supermarket attacks were police officers, and the live TV coverage of their colleagues storming the shop to save hostages led many to see them as heroes.  </p>\n<p>Then, in November, the first man to confront the attackers inside the Bataclan concert hall in Paris was an off-duty police officer who happened to be passing. He entered the building and shot one of the gunmen dead with his service revolver. A few days later police stormed a flat in St Denis, just north of the city, killing the suspected ringleader. </p>\n<p>\"The terror attacks are a decisive factor for many in our new intake,\" says the director of the training college, Jacques Richard.</p>\n<p>\"I think these young people are discovering a sense of duty and the desire to help their fellow human beings.</p>\n<p>\"When something like this happens, people pull together. Everyone wants to make their own contribution. There's been a big increase in the number of people volunteering to give blood, for example. And more people have wanted to join the emergency services and the police. It's had a big influence on the way people think.\" </p>\n<p>The image of the police in France has changed significantly over the past 20 years. The 1995 film <i>La Haine</i>, a hit both at the box-office and with the critics, portrayed the police as sadistic and racist. </p>\n<p>\"It's an anti-police film,\" explained Mathieu Kassovitz, who won the best director prize for the movie at Cannes that year. When the cast climbed the famous festival steps, the police on duty there turned their backs in protest.</p>\n<p>The police have had an extremely negative image in France for centuries, says historian Jean-Marc Berliere, who's written several books about them.  </p>\n<p>\"Even in Louis XIV's time the people loathed the police,\" he says. \"In the public imagination the police meant repression and the limitation of freedom.\" </p>\n<p>A defining moment was May 1968 when police and rioting students fought pitched battles around Paris's Sorbonne University. That revolutionary movement spread to workers bringing the French economy to a virtual standstill for two weeks. Violence erupted when President Charles de Gaulle tried to sort things out by sending in the police. </p>\n<p>But the media always had a soft-spot for the paving-stone-hurling students.  </p>\n<p>But four days after the Charlie Hebdo massacre, something extraordinary happened. People filled the streets of Paris to show their sympathy for the the victims and demonstrate their support for the police. A <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duCIpdE-Q6I&amp;list=RDduCIpdE-Q6I\" class=\"story-body__link-external\">video posted on YouTube</a> captures the moment. </p>\n<p>The crowd parts. There are women running - some of them laughing. \"What's going on?\" says the man filming with his smartphone. And then, police - in vans and on foot. Their black rubber shoulder protection giving them the kind of silhouettes usually associated with science fiction heroes. And the crowd starts to chant, \"<i>Merci, merci</i>\" - Thank you, thank you.</p>\n<p>\"I couldn't believe it,\" says Jean-Marc Berliere who was there. \"Here was a young, urban, intellectual crowd applauding the police! I saw women giving them flowers. I saw people shaking their hands. I saw women kissing them. And you could see how moved the police were. It was so unexpected.\"</p>\n<p>For Audrey, it made her realise that \"this job is, in fact, fantastic\".</p>\n<p>Something like this had happened only once before, says Berliere, at the liberation of Paris in August 1944. The police were the first to rise up against the Germans before the Allies got there. \"Afterwards, when they marched, the crowds shouted '<i>Vive les flics!</i>' - Long live the cops!\" he says.</p>\n<p>It's not clear if the police's popularity will last, or if it will sag like a souffle in a police canteen. </p>\n<p>A video of a police officer hitting a young black demonstrator at a recent demonstration against labour reforms has not helped their image. Neither has a book by renowned anthropologist Didier Fassin, La Force de l'Ordre (Security Forces). He was allowed to follow the police in one part of the Paris region from 2005 to 2007 and reports widespread brutality and racism. </p>\n<p>But, for the time being at least, a significant part of the French population is seeing the police in a new way.

			"body": "\n<p class=\"story-body__introduction\">The UK will take in up to 3,000 refugees, mostly vulnerable children, from the war-torn Syria region by 2020.</p>\n<p>The government called the move the \"largest resettlement programme for children in the world\".</p>\n<p>It is in addition to UK prime minister David Cameron's pledge to take 20,000 refugees by 2020. </p>\n<p>But critics said it would do nothing to help the thousands of lone refugee children who had made it to Europe, but were at risk of trafficking and abuse.</p>\n<p>The government scheme will target unaccompanied children in the Middle East and North Africa, as well as those considered at risk of abuse and exploitation, such as children threatened with child labour and child marriage. It will resettle children and their families \"where the UNHCR deems resettlement is in the best interests of the child.\"</p>\n<p>Several hundred people are expected to be resettled in the UK by April 2017 \"with a view to resettling up to 3,000 over the lifetime of this Parliament\", the government said. </p>\n<p>The five-year Syrian civil war has created more than 4.5 million refugees across the region - half of them children in need of food, education and a home. The UN has warned that a <a href=\"http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=53145#.VxjLOPn4-Uk\" class=\"story-body__link-external\">whole generation of Syrian children is at risk</a>.</p>\n<p>Immigration Minister James Brokenshire said:  \"We have always been clear that the vast majority of vulnerable children are better off remaining in host countries in the region so they can be reunited with surviving family members. However, there are exceptional circumstances in which it is in a child's best interests to be resettled in the UK. </p>\n<p> \"We have engaged with a number of NGOs, including the UNHCR on the best way to provide protection to refugee children and ensure their welfare and safety remain at the heart of every decision made.\"</p>\n<p>The scheme will be reviewed after two years.</p>\n<p>The announcement was welcomed by Children's Commissioner for England Anne Longfield, who said the children would get the \"vital protection and support they need\" in the UK.</p>\n<p>But Yvette Cooper, chairwoman of Labour's Refugee Taskforce, said the announcement included \"nothing new to help the thousands of child refugees alone in Europe who are at risk of trafficking, sexual exploitation and abuse\". </p>\n<p>\"Children are risking their lives every day making dangerous journeys, and Europol estimate at least 10,000 children have disappeared in the crisis, many trafficked into prostitution and modern slavery. Many children are sleeping rough or in makeshift camps because children's homes are full, and many have been sexually abused and exploited too.\"</p>\n<p>And Lib Dem leader Tim Farron suggested that the move was a \"cynical\" ploy - a bid to \"buy off\" Conservative backbenchers ahead of a Commons vote on the issue of unaccompanied children in the camps      next week.</p>\n<p>He told the BBC the announcement would not help the 30,000 unaccompanied children who have made it to Europe already but are at risks in camps:  \"Of those 30,000, 10,000 have gone missing. David Cameron has the ability, should he wish to do so, to step in and prevent these children who are go missing into the hands of child sexual exploiters, human traffickers... And yet once again he's failed to take the opportunity.\" </p>\n<p>And Labour's Lord Dubs, who moved the amendment to the Immigration Bill calling on the government to take in 3,000 child refugees already in Europe, said: \"While I welcome this proposal, it doesn't deal sufficiently with the substance of my amendment.\"</p>\n<p>\"You also have to wonder whether the use of the 3,000 figure is a deliberate ploy to muddy the debate.\" </p>\n<p>The government has already committed to resettle another 20,000 Syrian refugees under the Vulnerable Persons Resettlement Scheme, 1,000 of whom have already arrived, including more than 500 children.</p>"

A large number of aftershocks followed, including one that measured 7.3 on 12 May 2015. Photographer Alison Baskerville travelled to Nepal with Handicap International UK to meet young people whose lives were changed forever by those events.</strong></p>\n<p>Uma Silwal (right) was at home with her family when the earthquake hit.  </p>\n<p>\"We were sitting having lunch and the ground started to shake,\" she says. \"At first we just froze, we had no idea what to do. Then we ran. I don't remember the wall landing on me. I just remember seeing everyone running ahead in front of me.\"  </p>\n<p>At the time of the earthquake Uma was studying engineering. Her father had just retired from a long career in the Nepalese Fire Service and was adjusting to life at home with a reduced income. </p>\n<p>\"I knew I had to get educated and find work so I could help support my family,\" Uma says.  </p>\n<p>The earthquake destroyed their home. As well as looking after her family, Uma's mother has been involved in rebuilding their house, and feeding the workers. </p>\n<p>\"My mother does so much,\" says Uma. \"Sometimes I worry that we take her for granted. She is the closest person to me and keeps our family together.\"  </p>\n<p>Uma later decided to change her degree to social work. \"I had a few choices ahead of me before the earthquake. It felt like with two legs I have two paths to take.  </p>\n<p>\"After the quake I only have one leg but it's also given me one clear path. To help those who are like me.\"</p>\n<p>Amrit Magar was sleeping in his room in the Pepsicola district of Kathmandu when the earthquake hit.  </p>\n<p>With both parents at work he was home alone and unsure what to do. He tried to run from the house but as he escaped the building collapsed and he was buried in rubble. </p>\n<p>Neighbours managed to pulled him free and he was taken to hospital.  </p>\n<p>\"When the wall fell I was unconscious. When I woke up I thought my legs were fine,\" he says. </p>\n<p>But Amrit remained in a fracture ward until the decision was made to remove one of his legs because it was so badly damaged.   </p>\n<p>\"I loved football before my accident but now I like to read and I want to go back to school,\" says Amrit. </p>\n<p>His father says they can no longer keep Amrit at home as they cannot afford the taxi fares for him to go to the local clinic.  </p>\n<p>Amrit's brother Amish (middle) spent four weeks by his side in hospital.</p>\n<p>His mother, Chandra Kala Magar, holds a family photograph that was recovered from the home. They now live in a temporary home built by the family's employer. </p>\n<p>Ramesh Khatri, then 18, was trapped under rubble for almost three days. When he was eventually pulled free he was rushed to the already overcrowded Bir hospital in Kathmandu. He kept his badly damaged legs for almost five days before doctors decided they should both be amputated.  </p>\n<p>\"I just had to accept this new life I have been given without my legs. It has not been easy but I'm really trying to start again and adapt to my new life,\" he says.</p>\n<p>Ramesh uses the walkway at the National Disability Fund clinic in Kathmandu to train on his prosthetics.  </p>\n<p>Although he has become highly skilled in his wheelchair, he is now focusing on his walking.  </p>\n<p>A few days after breaking his third wheelchair, Ramesh decided to take part in a 3km race in the city. </p>\n<p>With bloodied hands and sweat on his brow, Ramesh pushed himself to sixth place out of 21. \"Next year I'm going to win this race,\" he shouted as he received his finishing medal.</p>\n<p>\"He is ever the optimist,\" says Samrat Singh Basnet, the owner of the hostel where Ramesh lives. \"He's always there in the clinic, helping and encouraging people.\"</p>\n<p>\"I want to study first and then I want to be a social worker to help other people like me,\" says Ramesh. \"Whatever happened, happened. This is our future. We should start from here. We can start again even with our disability.\"</p>\n<p>Sandesh was on his lunch break at the Nepal Police School when the earth began to shake. Along with his classmates he fled from the room where they were.   </p>\n<p>But the outside wall collapsed on top of him, pinning him to the ground.  </p>\n<p>\"We were going to hide under the beds but then we decided to run,\" says Sandesh. \"Then the wall fell down on me. I was unconscious until I got to hospital.\"</p>\n<p>He too lost his legs because of the injuries he sustained. In hospital, he also received the terrible news that his best friend had been killed. </p>\n<p>After almost nine months at home Sandesh has now returned to the police school.  </p>\n<p>He is the only student with a disability and the school have tried their best to accommodate him. But there is a steep slope between the classrooms and accommodation blocks, which makes it difficult for Sandesh to move between the two areas. He stays in the classroom area throughout the school day. </p>\n<p>During his time in hospital he says he lost motivation and found it difficult to accept his condition. With help from therapists and fellow patient Ramesh, he was able to come to terms with his disability. </p>\n<p>He began using a wheelchair, later also using crutches, until he received his prosthetic legs. \"I thought I would never walk again,\" he says. \"When I stood up for the first time I was so happy.\"</p>\n<p class=\"story-body__introduction\">All photographs © Alison Baskerville / Handicap International</p>"

			"date_published": 1461238750,
			"body": "\n<p class=\"story-body__introduction\">Mitsubishi Motors has admitted rigging data on some of its models' fuel efficiency. About 625,000 cars sold in Japan were affected, and the production of the relevant models has been halted. </p>\n<p>The inaccurate tests involved 157,000 of its own cars - the ek Wagon and eK Space - as well as 468,000 vehicles produced for Nissan - the Dayz and Dayz Roox.</p>\n<p>Car companies try to outdo each other on how fuel-efficient their models are. It impresses consumers because it's good for the environment, and it's easy on the wallet at the petrol station. </p>\n<p>Fuel efficiency is tested by putting cars on what is essentially a treadmill where they run at a certain speed and fuel consumption is measured. </p>\n<p>Mitsubishi appears to have overinflated the tyres, which gave better results on the fuel efficiency test.</p>\n<p>Imagine inflating your bicycle tyres to the maximum and going up a hill, then letting half the air out and going up the same hill again. It's much harder. The extra muscle you need gives you an idea of the extra fuel that a car would burn through. </p>\n<p>The controversy comes hard on the heels of the Volkswagen emissions scandal but is slightly different. </p>\n<p>Volkswagen installed hidden software in its diesel models that detected when an official emissions test was being conducted. The software would then lower the emission so the test readings were more favourable. </p>\n<p>So VW rigged the level of harmful gases coming from the exhaust pipe to make their cars look greener than they were. </p>\n<p>Mitsubishi rigged the fuel consumption readings so their cars would appear to use less fuel than they actually did. </p>\n<p>Mitsubishi is a somewhat confusing brand. There are a whole host of independent companies that share the name and trace their origins back to the original Mitsubishi company founded in 1870 in the shipping industry. </p>\n<p>The current companies though are entirely independent from each other. </p>\n<p>That means you will find the name in aviation, banking, air conditioners, the nuclear and chemical industry, optics and of course, cars. </p>\n<p>Mitsubishi Motors is the sixth biggest car maker in Japan and number 16 worldwide. </p>\n<p>Large-scale production got under way in the 1960s. In 1977 the company entered the European market and in 1982 the US market. Annual car production currently stands at 1,218,853 vehicles. </p>\n<p>The current scandal is at Mitsubishi Motors. Any damage to the brand name though, might spill over to the other companies. </p>\n<p>It's not the first time that Mitsubishi Motors has been in the headlines for misconduct. </p>\n<p>In the early 2000s, the company had to admit to lying about defects in its cars for decades.</p>\n<p>Back then, an internal investigation found that the firm had covered up faults since 1977 and repaired cars secretly, instead of reporting the problems to the transport ministry. </p>\n<p>The cover-up led to huge recalls, criminal charges against several employees and a cost of billions to the company. </p>"

Unveiling a plaque, meeting flag-waving members of the public on a walkabout, being presented with a bouquet of flowers - these are things she has done thousands of times. But the crowds weren't going to let her forget that this day, her 90th birthday, was something out of the ordinary. </p>\n<p>Some had been waiting for hours - some for days - to catch a glimpse of the Queen on the day she became the nation's first-ever nonagenarian monarch. </p>\n<p>As the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh walked the short distance from Windsor Castle, a spontaneous rendition of Happy Birthday rang out - and it wouldn't be the last. </p>\n<p>One woman who has lived nearly as long as the Queen summed up the atmosphere. Gwen Tarr, 88, who says she is \"Windsor born and bred\", said: \"It was so lovely. I just wanted to celebrate the day with her and wish her a happy birthday - and many more birthdays to come.\"</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-36101201\" class=\"story-body__link\">Wellwishers enjoy 'special day' </a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36099082\" class=\"story-body__link\">Cameron and Corbyn lead tributes</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-36104696\" class=\"story-body__link\">In pictures: Queen's 90th birthday</a></p>\n<p>Most of the gun salutes were due to be 21 shots - the standard royal gun salute - at locations including Hillsborough Castle, Cardiff Castle, and Edinburgh Castle. </p>\n<p>In London, the King's Troop Royal Horse Artillery staged a 41-gun salute at midday in Hyde Park. And the Honourable Artillery Company fired a 62-gun salute across the Thames from the Tower of London at 13:00 BST.</p>\n<p>Prime Minister David Cameron said the Queen had been \"a rock of strength for our nation\" and the Commonwealth, as he and fellow politicians paid tribute in the House of Commons.</p>\n<p>Mr Cameron said: \"Her Majesty The Queen has lived through some extraordinary times in our world.</p>\n<p>\"From the Second World War... to the rations with which she bought the material for her wedding dress. </p>\n<p>\"From presenting the World Cup to England at Wembley in 1966, to man landing on the moon three years later.

We will be investing on a commercial basis. We would not see this as nationalisation. We would not be seeking to acquire a control in the business. We don't think that nationalisation is the right answer.\"</p>\n<p>The steel industry welcomed the financial support package as \"a positive first step\".</p>\n<p>Gareth Stace, director of UK Steel, said: \"We have been calling for government to step up to the mark and provide this type of financial commitment and backing. </p>\n<p>\"We are not yet out of the woods however. Further action is still needed on energy costs and business rates whilst at EU level, we still need to see tougher action on the dumping of cheap imports. This will then provide the level playing field which will give UK companies a fighting chance to compete.\"</p>\n<p>On Tuesday, it emerged that Stuart Wilkie, managing director of Tata's Strip Products at Port Talbot, had canvassed workers about joining a bid by investing up to £10,000 of their own money.</p>\n<p>Tata Steel employs more than 10,000 people in the UK, and supports thousands of others, across plants in Port Talbot, Rotherham, Corby, Shotton and Teesside. The UK operations are losing about £1m a day.</p>\n<p>Tata's Scunthorpe operation, which employs more than 3,000, has been sold to investment firm Greybull Capital for a nominal £1.</p>\n<p>On Monday <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-36073140\" class=\"story-body__link\">Mr Javid joined ministers</a> and trade officials from 30 countries at a meeting in Brussels to discuss the global glut of steel.</p>\n<p>Although that meeting broke up without agreement, Mr Javid said that China had vowed to address \"a problem of overcapacity in their country\".</p>"

			"body": "\n<p class=\"story-body__introduction\">Australian federal MP Dennis Jensen is not the first politician to produce a racy thriller. One-time British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd has penned some breathless prose, as has the former Queensland Premier Peter Beattie. </p>\n<p>Dr Jensen, though, may be the first to lose his job, as he sees it, over a novel containing one steamy sex scene.</p>\n<p>A conservative Liberal Party backbencher, Dr Jensen is an outspoken opponent of same-sex marriage and a climate change sceptic. He boycotted the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/7241965.stm\" class=\"story-body__link\">2008 apology</a> to the Stolen Generations, and sparked outrage recently when he said taxpayers should not be funding the \"noble savage\" lifestyles of remote Aboriginal communities.</p>\n<p>His views endeared him to a group of powerbrokers from the party's evangelical Christian wing, whose support he was counting on to help him contest his Perth seat of Tangney at a federal election due later this year.</p>\n<p>However, when local Liberals met earlier this month to choose a candidate for Tangney, the MP was cast aside - by a humiliating 57 to seven votes - in favour of Ben Morton, the party's former state director. </p>\n<p>An angry Dr Jensen blamed a \"smear campaign\", allegedly mounted in collusion with The Australian, which days earlier had <a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/mp-dennis-jensen-used-official-stationery-to-spruik-his-novel/news-story/13b83249b32296ddd8027921ef11f447\" class=\"story-body__link-external\">revealed the existence of his book</a>, The Skywarriors, about an imaginary war between Australia and an Indonesian regime briefly backed by China.</p>\n<p>The newspaper reported that the 54-year-old used his parliamentary letterhead when writing to a Sydney literary agent in 2007 seeking a publishing deal. </p>\n<p>It also reproduced a scene from his book following the downing of an Australian warplane in the Indian Ocean. A fictional Indonesian dictator, Rajiv Rono, tells his mistress, Yasmine, that \"those arrogant Australians won't know what has hit them!\" He then rips off her blouse, \"completely ignoring her protests\", and enjoys \"the fruits of his victory\". </p>\n<p>The story was enthusiastically picked up by the rest of the Australian media. Then came a second article in which The Australian reported that Dr Jensen had \"recently left the family home... to live about 60km away [outside Tangney] with his new girlfriend\".</p>\n<p>\"It was a one-two shot against me,\" Dr Jensen told the BBC. </p>\n<p>\"One, he's a purveyor of smut. Two, he's abandoned his wife and kids to shack up with his new girlfriend. This was a very well organised, well co-ordinated strike, aimed with laser precision at my religious supporters, and it was quite effective in scaring them off.</p>\n<p>\"In fact, my wife left me in July 2014. She lived in the electorate home. I lived down at our holiday home. I met my current girlfriend, and we've been together subsequently, in November 2014. So none of that stuff was current.\"</p>\n<p>How does the sex scene in Dennis Jensen's The Skywarriors stack up against raunchy writing from politicians across the world? </p>\n<p>\"Flushed with the excitement of the moment, Rono felt that he just had to relieve himself. He violently pulled Yasmine's blouse buttons apart, completely ignoring her protests. Yasmine didn't believe in wearing bras; in fact, she didn't really need to\" - Dennis Jensen in The Skywarriors.</p>\n<p>\"She gently picked up his hand and guided it to their ecstasy\" - former Queensland Premier Peter Beattie in The Year of the Dangerous Ones.</p>\n<p>\"The din from the party mocked me as Karen attacked my surly worm with gusto\" - Australian Labor Party MP Graham Perrett in The Twelfth Fish.</p>\n<p>\"Suddenly the pouting sex kitten gave way to Diana the Huntress. She rolled onto him and somehow was sitting athwart his chest, her knees pinning his shoulders. 'Tell me, or I will make you do terrible things,' she hissed\" - Former US Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich in 1945.</p>\n<p>\"On that night of 12 May 1994, I needed that love Cherie gave me, selfishly. I devoured it to give me strength. I was an animal following my instinct\" - Tony Blair in his autobiography, A Journey.</p>\n<p>Dr Jensen is now suing The Australian for defamation - an action which prompted one columnist to hail him as \"that rarest of unpublished authors, who sues a publisher for publishing material, the publication of which he had previously actively sought\". </p>\n<p>In another paradoxical move last week, the MP self-published a Kindle edition of The Skywarriors, meaning that a work subject to a defamation claim is now available on Amazon for anyone with a spare A$6.51 ($5.07; £3.54).</p>\n<p>Even at that price, readers expecting a raunchy read may well feel cheated. The book contains just one sex scene: the 154-word, toe-curling encounter already reprinted by multiple news outlets. When two fighter pilots subsequently get together, we learn only of their \"voyage of gentle and passionate discovery\". </p>\n<p>And apart from mention of an Australian oil worker engrossed in Penthouse just before his rig is attacked by Indonesia off the Kimberley coast, that is it.</p>\n<p>Instead, the novel serves up page upon page of technical detail about combat aircraft and radar systems, along with characters such as Australian pilot Jenny Peters, whose athletic physique indicates she is \"unlikely to have weight problems later in life\" and whose \"shapely calves need no assistance from any stocking\".</p>\n<p>A former submarine operations researcher with the federal government's Defence Science and Technology Organisation (now Group), Dr Jensen calls The Skywarriors - which he wrote in 2002, two years before entering parliament - a techno-thriller, after the genre pioneered by Tom Clancy. </p>\n<p>The MP's father, who is a journalist and author, advised him that every book needs at least one passage of graphic sex to get published, he says. However, after completing The Skywarriors, Dr Jensen - a member of the joint standing parliamentary committee on foreign affairs, defence and trade - decided not to pursue his quest for a publisher, fearing that it might harm Australia's relations with Indonesia and China.</p>\n<p>So why self-publish it now? </p>\n<p>\"The plot is out in the public domain now, so the damage is done. And I thought I might have a shot at seeing if it would sell. Also to put the record straight and show it's not a work of erotica, as The Australian portrayed it.\"</p>\n<p>Dr Jensen, who has held the safe Liberal seat for nearly 12 years, insists the candidate selection battle was \"on a knife edge\" until the negative articles appeared. </p>\n<p>In truth, despite him winning record majorities, he has never been popular with local Liberals, who tried to dump him in 2006 and again in 2009. The first time, then Prime Minister John Howard intervened; the second, the party's state council stepped in. This time, it seems that there is no-one willing to save him. </p>\n<p>Now Dr Jensen is \"done with\" the Liberal Party, whose MPs are expected to confine themselves to \"branch stacking, fundraising and brainless conformity\", he claims. And while he is considering standing as an independent, he believes the recent publicity has probably ruined his chances.</p>\n<p>Does an alternative career as a fiction writer appeal? </p>\n<p>\"It would, but I know it's extremely difficult to make a living. For every Wilbur Smith you've got thousands that haven't made a penny or certainly not enough to support themselves.\" </p>"

			"date_published": 1461194914,
			"body": "\n<p class=\"story-body__introduction\">Singer Lily Allen has spoken out about her experience of being stalked by a stranger and her treatment by the police. It's not the first time a celebrity has received obsessive attention, but what are the stages that lead to somebody becoming a dangerous stalker?</p>\n<p>Lily Allen was relaxing in her flat last year when a stalker broke in and confronted her in her bedroom.</p>\n<p>\"I'm lying in bed and I can see the door handle moving and then he steams in, starts screaming and shouting... I could see he was really agitated and upset,\" she told the BBC's Newsnight.</p>\n<p>Alex Gray, from Perth, was charged and found guilty of harassment and burglary and is awaiting sentencing.  It was the culmination of an ordeal that started back in 2008 when Gray first contacted Allen on Twitter. Over time he began turning up at her house and office, left abusive notes and made suicide threats.</p>\n<p>Lily Allen is one of a long list of celebrities who have received persistent unwanted attention including singer Joss Stone and Little Mix's Jade Thirlwall. </p>\n<p>Television presenter and journalist Alexis Bowater has been stalked three separate times.</p>\n<p>\"It's extraordinarily psychologically damaging and traps you in an unwanted relationship with somebody that quite often you've never met and never want to meet. You're locked in a relationship with this perpetrator who's trying to control your life.\"</p>\n<p>But Alexis says super-fans and celebrity stalkers have little in common. While they may both have an intense interest in a particular celebrity, this is where the similarity ends.</p>\n<p>\"Stalkers frighten people and fans don't. There is a massive difference between meeting somebody and thinking 'she's quite nice and I'll send her some flowers' and approaching someone persistently doing that and making threats, pursuing and harassing them.\"</p>\n<p>Frank Farnham, consultant forensic psychiatrist at Barnet Enfield and Haringey Mental Health NHS Trust, agrees.</p>\n<p>\"Super-fans are relatively stable. They gain a lot from being in a group of people who like the same person. It's a pro-social behaviour. The super-fans know each other, they go to the same gigs together, they meet up and go for a drink,\" he says.</p>\n<p>\"With stalking, it's an anti-social behaviour. They think they have this special bond and this relationship with the celebrity and none of the other fans matter. When you're breaking into someone's bedroom, that's not the actions of a super-fan.\" </p>\n<p>It's a fundamentally different thing to start harassing people, says Dr Emma Short from Bedfordshire University. \"People with mental health problems who are vulnerable to delusions are the more likely to become stalkers,\" she says.</p>\n<p>\"The fixated celebrity stalker sees everything the celeb does in relationship to themselves. Everything has meaning. So if they are served with a cease and desist letter, they may think the celebrity is trying to contact them in code. </p>\n<p>\"The court process is complicated - for stalkers being in the same room as the celebrity can reinforce their feeling of attachment. Lily Allen spoke on Newsnight about how her stalker locked eyes with her. Being in the same room as her was very important to him.\"</p>\n<p>Celebrity stalkers get a huge amount of press, however they make up just a small part of those committing the criminal activity. Research from the Suzy Lamplugh Trust (which runs the National Stalking Helpline) has found one in five British women and one in 12 British men are victims of stalking during their lifetimes.</p>\n<p>Most celebrities don't know their stalkers, however in 90% of cases victims do know the person harassing them.</p>\n<p>Statistics from the National Stalking Helpline have revealed that 22% of stalkers are acquaintances of the victim, 5% worked or once worked with them, and 4% are family members. The largest group by far is ex-partners, who make up 45% of the total.</p>\n<p>Zoe Dronfield was stalked by a former partner who later attacked her. The mother-of-two from Coventry was left hospitalised with a bleed on her brain and a neck wound following an eight-hour attack. </p>\n<p>Zoe said she received calls, messages and emails and was harassed on social media after they broke up.</p>\n<p>\"There is a serious lack of understanding of stalking and the insidious behaviour behind it because certain incidents in isolation aren't frightening but when it gets to double figures and on a daily basis and you aren't able to function it's really frightening. You think 'what have I done to deserve this'?\"</p>\n<p>As classified by <a href=\"https://www.stalkingriskprofile.com/what-is-stalking/types-of-stalking\" class=\"story-body__link-external\">Australian academics</a> Paul Mullen, Michele Pathe and Rosemary Purcell.</p>\n<p>1: <strong>Rejected stalkers</strong> tend to be former sexual partners, who want to either reconcile or get revenge. They stalk because it allows the stalker to continue to feel close to the victim or allows them to salvage some self-esteem.</p>\n<p>2: <strong>Intimacy seeking stalkers</strong> suffer from loneliness and a lack of a confidante. Victims are usually strangers or acquaintances and the stalkers behaviour is often driven by mental health problems such as delusions. Celebrity stalkers often fall in to this category.</p>\n<p>3: <strong>Resentful stalkers</strong> feel they have been somehow mistreated by the victim and can arise from mental illness where the stalker develops paranoia. </p>\n<p>4: <strong>Predatory stalkers</strong> have deviant sexual interests. Stalking often starts as voyeurism for sexual gratification but can lead to sexual assault. </p>\n<p>5: <strong>Incompetent suitors</strong> want short-term sexual relationships. They usually stalk strangers or acquaintances for short periods. If they do persist they may be blind to the distress this causes and may have conditions that affect their social skills.</p>\n<p>Stalking is \"repeated, unwanted contact that occurs as a result of fixation or obsession and causes the victim(s) to feel distressed and fearful,\" according to the Suzy Lamplugh Trust.</p>\n<p>While the triggers for stalking can vary, the behaviour displayed follows a broadly similar pattern.</p>\n<p>\"It is common for stalking to escalate and get gradually worse over time. Stalkers are by nature obsessive and the longer they do it the more entrenched their fixation becomes,\" says Kristiana Rixon, from the trust.</p>\n<p>\"Stalking doesn't just affect the victim. A stalker typically contacts 21 people known to the victim including friends, family and neighbours. It's important that they don't engage with the stalker either as 5% of stalkers will assault someone known to the victim. Research shows 30 to 40% of victims are also physically assaulted.\"</p>\n<p>You should contact the police if you're being stalked - you have a right to feel safe in your home and workplace. Call 999 if you or someone else is in immediate danger otherwise contact your local police. </p>\n<p>Victims, whether they are celebrities or otherwise, experience a constant sense of dread and anxiety. </p>\n<p>\"I experienced what any other stalking victim would, which is hyper-vigilance,\" Alexis Bowater says.</p>\n<p>\"You know that an attack is imminent and inevitable but you just don't know where or when or who by.  You slowly change all of your behaviours, not all at once. Everything that you do is to make sure you and your family are safe. You spend your whole time expecting to be attacked at any moment.\"</p>\n<p>According to the Suzy Lamplugh Trust 80% of victims of stalking are women. Although women in their early 20s are slightly more likely to be stalked, age isn't a barrier. </p>\n<p>\"We've had cases from women in their 70s to women under the age of 18,\" says Rixon.</p>\n<p>Her advice on how to deal with stalkers is straightforward. </p>\n<p>\"If you are receiving unwanted attention tell them once. If they don't stop you shouldn't respond to them again as they will take this as an acknowledgement. I know this can be hard. You should also keep a record. You can also contact the National Stalking Helpline for advice and you can go to the police and make a report.\"</p>\n<p>The trust has argued that the police need to do more to support stalking victims. They have pointed to research that found only 26.6% of cases had been reported to the police and of those who made a report, 43% had not found the response helpful. </p>\n<p>Police action on stalking differs around the country.

			"title": "BBC How four men survived as hostages of IS",
			"date_published": 1461106854,
			"body": "\n<p class=\"story-body__introduction\">In his classic novel 1984, George Orwell writes about Room 101 - a torture chamber where you are subjected to your worst nightmare, the worst thing in the world, to break your resistance. </p>\n<p>To survive any such place of profound pain is the greatest of gifts, a triumph of the human spirit. In our time, surviving brutal captivity at the hands of so-called Islamic State in Syria must certainly count as such a triumph. </p>\n<p>When four former hostages came together this month for their first reunion since they were freed, at different times, two years ago, it was a celebration of friendship forged in the most threatening of circumstances, a remembrance of an agonising ordeal.</p>\n<p>In the BBC radio programme Held Hostage in Syria they recall months without sunlight, weeks chained together, days upon days of beatings. There was too little food, and so much longing for clean clothes, a proper toilet, and most of all, freedom.</p>\n<p>But it was also an affirmation of extraordinary resilience. They had all won what they call a \"game of survival\" which lasted about one long terrible year of torment for all of them.</p>\n<p>They played this game in their own individual ways to preserve themselves, and some semblance of human dignity. Federico Motka, an Italian aid worker, lowered his gaze and raised his guard to avoid his captors' efforts to demean him. French war correspondent Didier Francois pushed back and stared them straight in the eye. Danish photographer Daniel Rye Ottosen, an elite gymnast, did the splits to convince them he was not a spy.  French blogger Pierre Torres took beatings, but satisfaction, from ignoring their orders. </p>\n<p>And they played this game together, helping each other endure their ordeal, as IS guards of different nationalities deployed diverse tactics of physical and psychological torture to try to break them. Only one, Daniel Rye, was subjected to such brutality that he tried to take his own life - but the guards stopped him, and his fellow hostages brought him back to health. </p>\n<p>There were real games too: chess, with pieces fashioned from cheese cartons with nail clippers; draughts (checkers), with the seeds of olives and dates; a self-styled lecture series on everything from carp fishing, to sailing, and how to dive into a small pool. This is how they escaped in their mind.</p>\n<p>At one point in 2013-2014 19 men carrying a Western or a Russian passport were held hostage together in one small room. An adjacent room was a cell for five women. One by one, they have been freed for ransom or executed. Of this group of male hostages only one, British journalist John Cantlie, is left and one woman whose name has not been made public. </p>\n<p>Several journalists and aid workers, and hundreds of Syrians, have not lived to tell of their ordeal. We know of their fate from grotesque videos on social media which have brought a sickening cinematic slickness to medieval beheadings.</p>\n<p>These are the stories of four men who went to Syria to report on a punishing war, or to try to ease suffering in this humanitarian crisis of our time. They all went to help in some way. They all found themselves in a living hell.</p>\n<p>In our studio, they return to the dark, dreadful rooms they escaped two years ago. At moments they struggle to find the right words. At moments, they still can't draw them out. There's deep sorrow, but also smiles. \"When we meet,\" reflects Didier Francois, \"we can share things that we can't share with anyone else… it's important.\"</p>\n<p>What they can share with us is a compelling chronicle of our time. </p>\n<p>DIDIER: The way it happened was very fast. I crossed the border in the morning, around 10:30am, and by 11am I was caught. As soon as you crossed from Turkey into Syria, the trap was already closing in. There was one car behind us and another in front, five guys came out and it was all very professional. There was no way to escape. They took our glasses off, they took our shoes off so we couldn't run away, we were blindfolded and they took our phones away. After this, you put yourself in survival mode immediately.</p>\n<p>PIERRE: I graduated as an oceanographer, but in 2011 I was captivated with the Arab Spring. I was very interested in the city of Raqqa. It's now the self-declared capital of the Islamic State, but at that time, it was the first capital freed from the Assad regime… On the day I got caught, I was just two minutes from my friend's house, where I was staying. A car stopped to the left of me and four or five people were in it wearing ski masks. But at that time in Raqqa, that wasn't a scary sight. It was normal to see people in a car wearing ski masks in the middle of the afternoon. I just thought, \"Oh maybe they're just going to ask me what the time is.\" But then I saw the barrels of the pistols they were holding and realised it was something else. They started to punch me like hell from everywhere with the guns and the barrels of the guns. At one point I began to collapse and I saw that the top of the car was covered in blood. I then realised that the blood was coming from my head.</p>\n<p>FEDERICO: I was with David Haines [the British aid worker] in the car. We had just spent the day talking to community groups. We went to Atma camp just on the border and then we got back in the car and started driving to our safe house. I was actually on the phone with my boss at the time and didn't notice anything until there were suddenly two black cars around us. One in front and one behind. About eight fighters piled out of it and there was a lot of shouting. I just dropped my phone on to the seat next to me - which still had my boss on the other end of the line. In a blur, you just get pulled out of the car and put down on the floor. I remember there was a man on a bike just cycling past with a look on his face that just said, \"Oh crap.\" Then we were put into the boot of a car - but it didn't close properly so they took us out and put us back in again. Then we just sped off.</p>\n<p>DANIEL: The guard said to me \"Daniel, why do you have such wide shoulders? You look like a guy from the army or something.\" And I said, \"No, no, I'm not. I'm a former elite gymnast. That's why I look the way I do.\" And he replied, \"But that's why some of the other guards think that you're a spy.\" That was when I first got really scared. I tried to show him that I wasn't a spy, and that I really was a gymnast by doing the splits there and then on the mattress. And this guy was saying, \"Stop doing that. I'm supposed to interrogate you. I'm supposed to torture you.\" Then some other guys came down and they started to yell at me, shout at me and punch me. Many of the foreign fighters - the European or Western fighters that came - tended to be a bit more aggressive towards us. At some point, I remember they came in and they took me up, and I had to dance some kind of tango. That was really strange because you really felt like you were humiliated.   </p>\n<p>DIDIER: The difficult thing when you lose your freedom is that there are no rules. You are outside the rule of law. The guards are the ones who make the decisions and you've lost all your control. So the only thing you can keep for yourself is your dignity. You have to understand that they all had one objective - to keep us under their thumb. There were no nice guards or good guards - all of them were bad. But their strategies to control us as a group were different. Some resorted to extreme violence and others used more sophisticated tactics. The French guards were more into playing games with our minds, while the British were more into a direct approach - control and violence. And we never knew which method would be used. They came on a regular basis to beat you up with no reason, to show you that they are in charge. They put some pepper spray on my blindfold. There was no water and no food for four days. </p>\n<p>PIERRE: I had a massive guilt complex at one stage and it was bothering me all the time. I actually felt like I had accepted some things too easily and I wanted to be able to fight and struggle. So at one stage, I targeted a very young guard - I think he was from Tunisia. I stood in front of him and made direct eye contact. Those guards were so sensitive to body language and eye contact. So I stood in front of him very proud, and with my eyes I was saying, \"You're a piece of shit.\"… Then at one stage, that guard wanted to punch me. He came up to me holding a stick, and he tried to take me down with it, but I stood up. A few minutes later, he came back and he was so angry. He was really out of control. He took me away from the jail where I was and beat the crap out of me with the stick. Then he took me back to the cell with the others, and I was suffering a lot all over my body. He'd also punched me in the stomach so I had shit on my pants. But I was euphoric. It was like taking cocaine or something. I was feeling so great. I loved that moment and really appreciated it. It was worth it. </p>\n<p>DANIEL: I tried to focus on all the bright things in my situation. I started counting a lot, talking to myself, and started making up projects in my head. I think the survival mode that you go into when you're by yourself is very interesting. It's really, really difficult. You're just there with your brain, and yourself.  I could have good times when I thought everything seemed fine, and I could have bad times. When I look back now, I had different states of mind. I had the shock at the beginning. The second part was about accepting and adapting. The third part was thinking that this was my everyday life. This is when you become a good hostage. And for me, this is actually when the time started to go by faster. There was a point when I thought, \"I will not survive.\" I tried to escape and I tried to hang myself and I was rescued by the bad guys. They came in and they took me down and everything was OK, and I really felt that they would not kill me. But my point is that I went through that and suddenly I came to a new sense of self where the situation was completely different. </p>\n<p>FEDERICO: We were split up, me and Dave [David Haines]. Dave had given me three pieces of advice which I will never forget: always tell the truth; if we get split up make a routine; and play the game. They took me out and drove me off to another place, just a completely black cell with a toilet, and for about three weeks - nothing. Days and days of solitude. I would pace up and down and do these things like chatting to my parents and my sister in my head and try to sleep again. Anything to pass the days. We only really became a group with the other hostages much later on, at the end of July. Our only ability to keep dignity was to try to keep as clean as you could. But we were going through a routine of having our hands cuffed behind our back at night and our hands cuffed in front during the day. On some occasions when they told us that we smelt too bad, the handcuffs would be taken off so we could take our T-shirts off and wash our armpits with a little bit of water. That was for me the way to maintain dignity… I'd been wearing the same clothes that I'd had on that afternoon that we got caught up right until July - even longer than that actually. I just took every opportunity whenever I went to the toilet to wash them in water. It was my obsession.</p>\n<p>DIDIER: This cloth is a cotton scarf in which I had hidden some chess pieces, made from Vache Qui Rit cheese boxes. We played chess a lot.</p>\n<p>PIERRE: We organised lectures, we organised sport and we organised games. </p>\n<p>FEDERICO: We used blankets to make a boat on the ground and I then tried to explain with my very limited physics how sails work and boats go faster. Alan Henning gave a lecture on carp fishing I think. </p>\n<p>[Pierre gave a lecture on how to make iron. Daniel gave a lecture on diving from a high board into a small pool.]</p>\n<p>DANIEL: I remember my brain was thirsty. It wanted any information no matter what it was, as long as it was somebody talking about something from the real world.</p>\n<p>FEDERICO: There was another game that we did that was really great - we did versions of Werewolf, also called Mafia. Whoever was narrating created the plot and then handed out characters and then people had to behave in that way. We had prima donnas and a prostitute at one point. </p>\n<p>DIDIER: We were obsessed with food - that was a long part of every discussion. Every night we tried to imagine a menu with the \"non-dessert of the day\". So it was the non-menu and a non-dessert that we would never get. When I got out, the first meal given to me was from the French intelligence team who were part of the army. It was when I was on the military plane, they opened the cans of cassoulet with beers. That was great. </p>\n<p>DANIEL: I think the whole time the hostages and I were sitting inside together, we shared the same dream of crossing the border together. That wherever we were, we would go to a hotel together and there would be a buffet. We spoke a lot about that buffet, and how 19 guys would sit around the table and share it together. A day that should be a very happy day; crossing the border, going into freedom and going back to our families. And there was still some part of me staying behind in Syria saying, \"It's only the end when all of us can sit around this table and eat our buffet.\"</p>\n<p>DIDIER: I think among all the hostages, we still have a strong bond. You can't live what we went through without keeping something. Even the bad parts of it. When we meet we share things that you cannot share with anyone else. It's very important.</p>\n<p>PIERRE: Some of us were coming out of really tough experiences, we all had difficulties and we were all such different characters, but we really teamed up with each other. We built up something very strong between us.</p>\n<p>FEDERICO: I had received a proof-of-life question - the colour of the bedroom wall in my mum's house is orange. It was one of the most bittersweet moments of my life. Up until then I had to believe that David [Haines] and I would be released together and that was the moment that I realised it wasn't happening and I cried like a baby. Dave was sitting next to me and he hugged me and everyone was really nice. They said, \"Take this chance.\" David knew by then that things weren't looking great. My proof of life meant his loss of a certain level of hope.</p>\n<p>[David Haines was beheaded in September 2014, four months after Federico was released.]</p>\n<p>DANIEL: When I was released, we were eight guys left - me and a German guy, and three Brits and three Americans. I got my proof of life, then the German guy got his proof of life a few days later. At that point it was very clear that they were not negotiating for the Americans and the Brits. The day that I was released, I was sitting in a corner and I was crying, early in the morning, all by myself just with a blanket over my head not to show the other guys that I was nervous. And then James [Foley] came over to me, put his arm over my shoulders and said, \"Don't worry, they will probably come in 10 or 15 minutes, and you will be on your way home, and just enjoy it. You really earned your freedom.\"</p>\n<p><i>Subscribe to the </i><a href=\"https://ssl.bbc.co.uk/newsletters/newsmagazine?ptrt=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine\" class=\"story-body__link\">BBC News Magazine's email newsletter</a><i> to get articles sent to your inbox.</i></p>"

			"body": "\n<p class=\"story-body__introduction\">The ground convulsion resulting from North Korea's underground nuclear bomb test in January has been mapped by Europe's Sentinel-1a radar satellite.</p>\n<p>The EU spacecraft uses a technique called interferometry to sense surface movements.</p>\n<p>Its data shows rock above the blast zone going down by up to 7cm in one area and rising 2-3cm in another.  </p>\n<p>The imagery was released by Germany's Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources (BGR).</p>\n<p>It advises the federal government on matters related to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT).</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-35240509\" class=\"story-body__link\">The 6 January event</a> was described by North Korean media as a miniaturised hydrogen bomb detonation, but there has been <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-11813699\" class=\"story-body__link\">no independent confirmation of this claim</a>. </p>\n<p>All of North Korea's tests (2006, 2009, 2013, 2016) appear to have occurred at a site called Punggye-ri, also known as P'unggye-yok, in a remote region in the east of the country, near the town of Kilju.</p>\n<p>The data picked up by international seismometers has given very good location information, but the new Sentinel imagery refines these estimates further. </p>\n<p>Satellite interferometry works by finding the difference in \"before\" and \"after\" radar pictures of the Earth's surface. It allows even quite subtle ground movements to be detected.</p>\n<p>Sentinel-1a got its first view of the test site following the explosion on 13 January, and this was compared with an observation acquired on 1 January.</p>\n<p>The effects of both subsidence and uplift are evident.   </p>\n<p>\"This is a very important result because in the past the location of nuclear tests was based only on seismological data and now we have an indication from other technologies,\" said BGR's Nicolai Gestermann. </p>\n<p>At the moment, the 12-day repeat in observations is the best this radar satellite can achieve, but on Friday a sister spacecraft will be launched by the European Space Agency that should reduce the re-visit time to just six days.</p>\n<p>Because of the gap in time between the blast and the subsequent image retrieval, scientists cannot say whether the ground deformation occurred at the same time as the detonation or a few days later.</p>\n<p>Seismologists say the bomb test had a magnitude of 5.1.</p>\n<p>Its characteristics were very similar to the previous explosion conducted in 2013, suggesting the 6 January event was not, as claimed, a thermonuclear blast, said Dr Gestermann.</p>\n<p>The estimated yield was 10 kilotons of TNT-equivalent, plus or minus three kilotons, he added.</p>\n<p>The BGR scientist was presenting his institute's work here <a href=\"http://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU2016/EGU2016-15713.pdf\" class=\"story-body__link-external\">at the European Geosciences Union General Assembly</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"mailto:Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk\" class=\"story-body__link-email\"><span class=\"icon email\"></span><span class=\"story-body__link-email-text\">Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk</span></a> and follow me on Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/BBCAmos\" class=\"story-body__link-external\">@BBCAmos</a></p>"

			"body": "\n<p class=\"story-body__introduction\">In St Clair County, Illinois, the local prosecutor is trying a radical new experiment: admitting his office has charged innocent people with crimes and clearing their names before they spend a day in prison. It's a unique reform effort as prosecutors around the country face increased scrutiny and diminishing public trust.</p>\n<p>Lashonda Moreland's day had barely begun when the pounding on the front door began. Her husband had already left for work, and she was home with her two children in their second storey apartment in a suburb of St Louis, Missouri. </p>\n<p>When a voice barked through the door, Moreland realised the figures outside were police officers. </p>\n<p>\"He said, 'You need to open up the door or we're going to kick it down,'\" she recalls. \"My kids are scared and they're crying...I'm upset and I start crying.\"</p>\n<p>The police arrested Moreland - a 30-year-old home healthcare worker with no criminal history - and she spent the next several days in various jails until she was transferred over the river to St Clair County, Illinois.</p>\n<p>\"It was scary because I had never been in jail. I never had to be on lockdown,\" she says. \"I literally cried every day. I was trying to wrap my mind around, 'Why am I in here?'\"</p>\n<p>Moreland was accused of shoplifting, evading police and for trying to run down a police officer with her car. </p>\n<p>Several months prior to her arrest, a young couple walked into an Old Navy store in a strip mall in Fairview Heights, Illinois. They shoveled little girls' coats, jeans and pants into bags, some still attached to their hangers, then walked out and got into a maroon Buick LeSabre with nearly $700 (£495) worth of stolen merchandise. A security guard called the police.</p>\n<p>The responding officers from the Fairview Heights Police Department quickly located the car at a traffic signal, and an officer named Drew Rutter got out of his patrol vehicle and approached the driver's side of the Buick on foot.</p>\n<p>\"The driver and I made eye contact, and I observed her grasp the steering wheel,\" Rutter later wrote in his report. \"Fearing for my life and the safety of others in the area, I immediately drew my department issued duty weapon.\"</p>\n<p>The car lurched past him and another officer, missing Rutter's legs by \"inches\", and disappeared down the highway.</p>\n<p>All the police had was the licence plate number, which was registered to Lashonda Moreland's address. When Officer Rutter looked at Moreland's driver's licence photo, he immediately identified her as the woman who had tried to run him over. </p>\n<p>Moreland didn't own a Buick, nor did she do her shopping 30 minutes away in a completely different state. She did, however, have a cousin who had registered his maroon Buick LeSabre to her address without telling her. She explained all this to the Fairview Heights police when they first contacted her after the incident, but they didn't believe her.</p>\n<p>Things looked bad for Moreland. She couldn't prove her alibi and the witness who placed her at the scene was an officer of the law. She was facing up to 11 years in prison. </p>\n<p>Instead of getting dragged through a jury trial, something surprising happened. Moreland's lawyer Kristi Flint told the St Clair County state's attorney office that her client was innocent. In response, the prosecutor offered Moreland the chance to take a polygraph test. Flint nervously agreed, and Moreland passed. Six months after her arrest, the charges were dropped. Everyone, including the Fairview Heights police department, agrees that Moreland is innocent. </p>\n<p>Moreland did not know it at the time, but she was the beneficiary of a new programme created by St Clair County State's Attorney Brendan Kelly: the Actual Innocence Claim Policy and Protocol. It is a unique, pre-conviction intervention which attempts to prevent the \"actually innocent\" from going through a trial, taking a plea deal, or ending up in prison.</p>\n<p>Actual innocence is a legal concept which means, simply, that a defendant did not commit the crime of which he or she is accused. It is usually invoked when a prison inmate is attempting to appeal his sentence, but Kelly wanted to bring the spirit of the concept to the pre-conviction level. </p>\n<p>\"That's distinct from 'I didn't get treated fairly',\" says Kelly, a Navy veteran who became the county's top law enforcement officer in 2010 when he was only 34 years old. \"It's not, 'Some of the evidence was obtained unlawfully, there was an incorrect ruling by the court, on the trial level some error by the defense' - no, you actually have the wrong person here...they're actually innocent.\"</p>\n<p>Since Kelly implemented the policy two years ago, nine defendants - including Lashonda Moreland - have had their charges dropped before trial. Those cases include a reckless homicide by vehicle, four armed robberies and one murder. </p>\n<p>To the best of his knowledge, no other prosecutor in the country is attempting anything quite like it. Even the US Department of Justice has taken an interest in what is happening in St Clair County.</p>\n<p>\"I think it is a nightmare scenario for any prosecutor or any police officer to have investigated and prosecuted and convicted the wrong person,\" says Kelly. \"That strikes at our very sense of what our job is all about, which is to seek justice.\"</p>\n<p>There is an increasing body of evidence that suggests that local prosecutors had an enormous hand in the explosion of the US prison population. </p>\n<p>Theirs is an incredibly powerful position in the American criminal justice system, though the job is not well understood by the general public. Popular works of true crime journalism like Netflix's Making a Murderer and the podcast Serial are beginning to change that, and cast the prosecutors in each case in a fairly villainous light.</p>\n<p>\"Between 1994 and 2008, the main cause of rising prison populations is DAs [district attorneys] filing felony cases. This seems to be true across the United States,\" says John Pfaff, a professor at Fordham Law School.  \"DAs have kind of managed to avoid a lot of attention for a long time.\"</p>\n<p>Simply put, prosecutors decide what crimes to charge defendants with. A single crime can have a smorgasbord of potential charging options for prosecutors, ones that can come with short or extremely long mandatory minimum sentences. In the \"tough on crime\" era of the late 1990s, prosecutors started bringing harsher charges more often. Since the vast majority of cases settle with a plea deal, those charges and their sentences stick, meaning prosecutors essentially dictate how much time a person will serve. Only a tiny number of defendants go to trial to challenge the prosecutor. </p>\n<p>\"District attorneys have almost unfettered discretion on who to charge and who not to charge,\" says Pfaff. \"There's almost no judicial review of what kind of charges you choose, as long as the facts are there to back them up.\"</p>\n<p>The introduction of DNA evidence was a game changer in terms of public awareness of the choices prosecutors make. Suddenly, inmates who'd served decades in prison or been sentenced to the death were able to prove they were innocent. There have been<a href=\"http://www.law.umich.edu/special/exoneration/Pages/about.aspx\" class=\"story-body__link-external\"> 1,773 exonerations in the US</a> since 1989. </p>\n<p>This has shone a new light on hard-charging prosecutors who fought for the convictions in the first place, and then sometimes opposed the inmates' bid for freedom, even after DNA evidence contradicted their theory of the crime.</p>\n<p>\"I think because of some of the professional incentives to get convictions and maintain convictions, and political incentives to be tough on crime, the justice role takes a back seat to the advocacy role,\" says Northeastern University law professor Daniel Medwed, author of Prosecution Complex: America's Race to Convict and Its Impact on the Innocent. </p>\n<p>\"It's a little bit of human nature. Once you've made a decision to do something, it often takes a lot of countervailing evidence to get them to change their minds.\"</p>\n<p>But not all prosecutors have buried their heads in the sand when it comes to cases of actual innocence. In the last five years, the number of prosecutors who created so-called <a href=\"http://www.law.umich.edu/special/exoneration/Documents/Exonerations_in_2015.pdf\" class=\"story-body__link-external\">\"conviction integrity units\"</a>, or \"a division of a prosecutorial office that works to prevent, identify and correct false convictions\", have quadrupled. Some have set up screening committees to vet certain types of cases, like a prosecutor in New York state who decided that any case that relied on single eyewitness identification automatically warrants special attention.</p>\n<p>However, most remedies become available after defendants have already spent a significant amount of time behind bars. That was the conclusion of Jim Piper, first assistant state's attorney for St Clair County, when he found himself listening to a radio story about the highly lauded conviction integrity unit in Brooklyn, New York, while getting the oil in his car changed one day in 2013.</p>\n<p>\"So many cases had been overturned where young men had been sitting in jail for years and years before someone got around to vetting the prosecution,\" he recalls. \"It occurred to me - why are we doing that at the end? Why don't we have a procedure in place on the front end to vet prosecutions before they can become a conviction?\"</p>\n<p>St Clair County is an interesting laboratory for such an experiment. A county with a population of about 280,000, it encompasses the city of East St Louis, which at one time led the nation with its murder rate and has struggled since the 1970s with joblessness, drugs and violent crime. There are 32 arresting agencies of all sizes within the county - from a single part-time officer in Summerfield to the 1,700-officer Illinois State Police - who police everything from the urban industrial riverfront on the western border to the corn fields on the eastern edge. It has its share of official corruption. Kelly has charged 13 police officers in the county with various crimes, everything from theft of evidence to battering a suspect to forcing a woman to perform oral sex at a traffic stop.</p>\n<p>\"We have every kind of case you can think of,\" says Kelly, who grew up in the area.</p>\n<p>Around the time that Piper was getting that fateful oil change, the St Clair County state's attorney had three cases on his plate where defence lawyers genuinely believed their clients could be innocent. This is an anomaly - typically, defendants will challenge evidence, or request a lesser charge, but few claim to be actually innocent.</p>\n<p>In response, Kelly and Piper authored a simple protocol: If a defendant, their counsel or anyone else associated with the case brought forward compelling reasons to believe that the defendant was innocent, the defendant would be allowed to take a polygraph or a voice-stress test. Piper says that though they know these kinds of tests can be unreliable, being confronted with the chance to take one can filter out disingenuous defendants. Regardless of the results of the test - which are inadmissible at trial due to issues with the reliability of the technology - the assistant state's attorney (ASA) in charge of the case would also perform a \"de novo\" or \"from the beginning\" review of all the evidence. </p>\n<p>\"The ASA shall confirm that no other probative forensic testing can be conducted and that no other witnesses can be identified and interviewed,\" the protocol reads. \"At the end of this review, if both the ASA and supervising ASA(s) either no longer believe there exists a moral certainty of the defendant's guilt or believe there no longer exists a reasonable likelihood of conviction, then the case shall be dismissed without prejudice.\" </p>\n<p>One of the first tests of the programme was a murder case. Rodney Lewis admitted he stabbed 18-year-old Michael Barton Jr, but always maintained that it was in self defence. He passed his polygraph, and after re-examining the evidence, the assistant state's attorney dropped the charges. After 414 days in the St Clair County jail, he went home. </p>\n<p>\"I think it was his mother who went and picked him up,\" says Lewis' lawyer, Thomas Keefe III. \"She was very, very happy.\"</p>\n<p>Each of the nine cases has a different set of circumstances that led to charges being filed and ultimately dropped. Eyewitnesses identified the wrong perpetrators. Co-defendants implicated friends or acquaintances who were never there. In one case of an armed robbery of a mobile phone, the defendant falsely confessed after he says he was pressured by investigators. </p>\n<p>\"I thought I was going to jail anyway, so, I just said I did it,\" <a href=\"http://www.bnd.com/news/local/article55051595.html\" class=\"story-body__link-external\">he told the Belleville-News Democrat</a>, which broke the news of the programme. \"But I didn't know anything about it.\"</p>\n<p>So far, Kelly says just one claim that was investigated under the protocol actually yielded more evidence of the defendants' guilt, bolstering the state's case - a natural check, he believes, on the programme being abused.</p>\n<p>Some have pointed out that vetting cases before trial is a basic tenet of the work of a prosecutor, that Kelly's protocol just codifies what he is supposed to be doing anyway. If that's the case, the revolutionary step seems to be a simple willingness to publicly admit defendants were charged erroneously.</p>\n<p>\"I was honestly kind of surprised that they came forward and said, 'We dumped these [cases] because of actual innocence,'\" says Cathy MacElroy, a defence lawyer who has had two clients exonerated under the protocol.</p>\n<p>Kelly claims there have been no complaints from police about the programme, and he wants people to know that even though officers may initially arrest the wrong person, it is good police work that can correct an error as well.</p>\n<p>\"It's an imperfect world. We have good people in law enforcement and good people in the criminal justice system and good people as witnesses, but they can all make mistakes.\"</p>\n<p>In 19-year-old Brandon Jackson's case, it was the work of defence lawyers that ultimately cleared him. Another teenager implicated Jackson in a plot to lure a tattoo artist who made house calls to an abandoned home, and rob him of his money and equipment. When two of the perpetrators eventually took plea deals, they independently admitted that Jackson had nothing to do with the robbery.</p>\n<p>Still, Jackson - and other wrongfully charged individuals - has a hard time feeling grateful. He was 17 at the time of his arrest, and after spending months both in a juvenile detention centre then on house arrest, he couldn't graduate from high school. Now he lives at home with his mother and works in a warehouse. </p>\n<p>\"It was very stressful when I was locked up. I didn't know when I was coming home. When you get arrested for nothing, you don't know what is going on. Then they're offering you years of your life for nothing,\" he says. \"It took a whole year off my life.\"</p>\n<p><strong>More from the BBC on US criminal justice</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24119398\" class=\"story-body__link\">Why does Wisconsin send so many black people to jail?</a> - The state that locks up the highest percentage of black men</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-34705968\" class=\"story-body__link\">The US inmates charged per night in jail</a> - Reversing a widespread practice known as \"pay to stay\"</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-33681160\" class=\"story-body__link\">Why is it so hard to hire black police officers?</a> - One department's effort to diversify</p>\n<p>Then there's the fact that he had to pay the county $5 per day while he was on an ankle monitor, plus the cost of a landline to carry the monitor's signal. For his mother Ommie, a double amputee who lives on a fixed income, these were not trivial expenses, nor was hiring a private attorney. She says they're still paying their legal bill in instalments. </p>\n<p>Detavius McGary, who was accused of and then exonerated of charges that he robbed an elderly woman at gunpoint, spent 75 days in jail, then also had to pay a per diem fee for a year of ankle monitoring. His mother says she knows her son was lucky to have the chance to prove his innocence, but that she is now \"completely broke\". McGary says he wanted to sue the county but can't find a lawyer to take the case. And there were other costs.</p>\n<p>\"When they had me, I couldn't really see my kids,\" McGary says. \"I had so many good job opportunities, [but] then people, they weren't accepting me because of the case.

Flint says that clients like Moreland are lucky that they could afford to bond out - a more indigent client who is actually innocent might have just pleaded guilty in order to get out of jail. Six of the nine defendants spent over a month in jail - the longest was Lewis' 414 days.</p>\n<p>\"I think that it is admirable that Brendan has put this out here as, 'Yes, innocent people get charged and when they do, you know, we dismiss it,'\" says Flint. \"But my question is, OK, so what do we do after this? What is he doing with this information? Lashonda is out money, the stresses that she went through - there's no making her whole.\"</p>\n<p>In his cluttered office on the second floor of the St Clair County courthouse - a map of East St Louis with violent crimes, usually gun violence, marked with red stickers in one corner - Kelly admits that his protocol is an experiment, one he can't guarantee will be successful. </p>\n<p>\"I think we're going to review it every year and just see how it's going. The public defenders, the prosecutors are in the trenches every day and we get continuous feedback,\" he says.</p>\n<p>Currently, the St Clair County state's attorney's office is looking at two new possible cases of actual innocence - this time cases of alleged sexual abuse of a child. </p>\n<p>Kelly does not think being open to admitting law enforcement mistakes makes him soft on crime. He considers himself an \"aggressive\" prosecutor who believes in law enforcement and its role in bringing about the precipitous decline in crime in the US since the 1990s. In his first year in office, he doubled the number of charges filed, though he sent many of those cases to drug and mental health courts. It's a line he says he walks because he believes there is no \"criminal justice without social justice\".</p>\n<p>\"Your local DA is accountable not to some person who appointed them in DC, or some state capitol somewhere, but is accountable to the people that they serve,\" he says. \"I think the prosecutor has the ability to be uniquely part of the solution, because again, we're the one entity whose duty is first and foremost to justice.\"</p>\n<p><i>Subscribe to the </i><a href=\"https://ssl.bbc.co.uk/newsletters/newsmagazine?ptrt=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine\" class=\"story-body__link\">BBC News Magazine's email newsletter</a><i> to get articles sent to your inbox. </i></p>"

			"title": "BBC William Shakespeare's economic legacy",
			"date_published": 1461194750,
			"body": "\n<p class=\"story-body__introduction\">William Shakespeare may be widely regarded as finest playwright in the English language, but when he put his quill down he was also a savvy businessman.</p>\n<p>In Elizabethan London, the original Globe Theatre could accommodate 3,000 people. Commoners or \"groundlings\" paid a penny to stand in the open air, while the gentry parted with as many as six pennies to sit on cushions in the covered galleries.</p>\n<p>Notwithstanding the fact that the Globe burned down in 1613, Shakespeare's share in the playhouse made him a tidy fortune.</p>\n<p>He also part-owned another London theatre and a production company. And back in his hometown of Stratford-upon-Avon in Warwickshire, he invested widely in land and property, and reportedly bought and sold grain.</p>\n<p>By the time Shakespeare died on 23 April 1616 - 400 years ago on Saturday - he was a very wealthy man. In today's money he would have comfortably been a millionaire.</p>\n<p>Fast-forward four centuries, and Shakespeare would likely be rather pleased that his work and legacy continues to support a large and lucrative industry, which is far from being limited to the sale of theatre tickets and employment of actors.</p>\n<p>Instead, Shakespeare supports a substantially wider business community - from hotels and restaurants in Stratford, to walking tours in London, bars near a balcony in the Italian city of Verona, sales of books and memorabilia, and even leadership classes for businessmen and women. </p>\n<p>It is definitely not much ado about nothing.</p>\n<p>Piers Ibbotson says there are so many lessons from Shakespeare about the perils and pitfalls of power that it has provided him with an inexhaustible fund of material for his management and leadership workshops over the past two decades.</p>\n<p>\"The plays of Shakespeare are case studies for central human dilemmas,\" says the 61-year-old, who is part of Warwick Business School's Create unit.</p>\n<p>\"The plays are so rich, and so complex, that there are actual situations to examine. Acting things out is very powerful, people can physically get inside situations.\"</p>\n<p>Create uses Shakespeare's plays to guide students, and business clients, through numerous difficult business situations.</p>\n<p>Macbeth, for example, is viewed as a study into the limits of ambition, while The Tempest is seen as a metaphor for a perfect storm of workplace rivalry.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, A Midsummer Night's Dream is used to explore business transformation, and the Merchant of Venice teaches contract enforcement.</p>\n<p>Mr Ibbotson says: \"Shakespeare is such a wonderful asset and of course you're always using such powerful language -  it allows people to articulate much more subtle and complex ideas than thin business language.\"</p>\n<p>Richard Olivier, 54, is another person who uses Shakespeare's plays to teach good leadership and business practice.</p>\n<p>The son of Sir Laurence Olivier, the UK's most famous 20th Century Shakespearian actor, Mr Olivier says: \"Shakespeare is an amazing ethical teacher.</p>\n<p>\"Apart from the history plays, there is no play where the bad guy ends up in charge at the end.\"</p>\n<p>Clients of Mr Olivier's company Olivier Mythodrama have included NHS management, the Metropolitan Police and Daimler-Benz. His charges range from £5,000 for a half-day session to as much as £40,000 for a six-day intensive course.</p>\n<p>Mr Olivier adds: \"There's huge drama in leadership, and Shakespeare was probably the first playwright to portray the human drama of leadership in three-dimensional form.\"</p>\n<p>The area known as Shakespeare's England (which takes in the towns of Stratford, Royal Leamington Spa, Kenilworth and Warwick) received 9.94 million tourists in 2014, according to the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust, the charity that cares for Shakespeare heritage sites.</p>\n<p>It adds that the total value of tourism to the local economy is in the region of £635m, which supports some 11,150 jobs.</p>\n<p>Alisan Cole, from the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust, says: \"2014, the 450th anniversary of Shakespeare's birth, was our record year with 820,000 visitors, and we're expecting 2016 to be on a par with it, if not exceed it.\"</p>\n<p>In terms of attracting hungry and thirsty tourists, Hathaway Cafe is perfectly positioned in the centre of Stratford, and is just a short walk from the Royal Shakespeare Theatre.</p>\n<p>Manager and owner Rick Allen, 51, says that during the summer the warren-like Tudor-era teashop is packed with Asian customers, typically from China and Taiwan, playing £13 a head for afternoon tea (or £18 with a glass of prosecco).</p>\n<p>\"Off-peak we get around 1,000 customers per week, but it's well over 2,000 per week during the peak season of July and August,\" he says.</p>\n<p>Mr Allen adds that Birmingham Airport's new runway extension, which caters for the growing number of flights from East Asia, has been a fillip for the business.</p>\n<p>\"We're literally getting calls from people saying 'we've got a booking for 24 and we're on our way'. In August it's mayhem - good fun, but mayhem.\"</p>\n<p>Down in London former actor Declan McHugh, 55, has been taking people on Shakespeare-themed guided walks since 1999.</p>\n<p>He says his business - Shakespeare in the City Walk - has grown thanks to positive word of mouth, and good reviews on websites such as TripAdvisor.</p>\n<p>Mr McHugh adds that London is a rich seam for Shakespeare fans since the playwright spent most of his working life moving through the then murky and bohemian world of the Elizabethan city's playhouses.</p>\n<p>Charging £10 per adult, he says the Shakespeare anniversary year is shaping up as a record one for his business.</p>\n<p>\"I've been doing this for 17 years and I'm starting to reap the rewards,\" he says.</p>\n<p>While he says it's hard to give exact numbers, he normally gets between five and 10 people meeting him outside Blackfriars underground station every Friday at 11am. But that's just for the public walks.</p>\n<p>\"Then I also do regular walks privately for colleges and universities from across the globe, plus there's UK institutions and businesses. I have the Girl Guides coming next Monday, for example.</p>\n<p>\"Private walks usually are for 15-20 people but I have done the tour for 60 people before,\" he says.</p>\n<p>Mr McHugh says his fascination for Shakespeare began at 11 years old, and now he regards the Bard as pretty much \"his guardian angel\".</p>"

			"title": "BBC The strange way people looked at food in the 16th Century",
			"date_published": 1461150898,
			"body": "\n<p class=\"story-body__introduction\">It may seem a peculiarly 21st Century preoccupation, but people in Shakespeare's England were also obsessed with food, writes Dr Joan Fitzpatrick. </p>\n<p>The 16th Century had plenty of diet books. </p>\n<p>Andrew Boorde's Compendious Regiment (1542) warns against eating and drinking to excess and often remarks upon the behaviour and diet of English people, noting that the English spend too long sitting at dinner and supper, feeding on heavy meats before lighter ones, which isn't good for their digestion. </p>\n<p>William Bullein's Government of Health (1558) takes the form of a dialogue between John, a self-confessed glutton, and Humphrey, a man of moderate habits. </p>\n<p>In Sir John Falstaff, Shakespeare's notorious glutton, we're presented with a character who defies both dietary and religious authorities by eating and drinking to excess whenever he pleases. </p>\n<p>It was generally believed that eating meat was divinely ordained and the dietary authors promoted meat as more healthy than a vegetarian diet, although it had to be considered whether or not a specific meat was suited to one's \"humour\", occupation, and even nationality. </p>\n<p>For example, bacon was thought fitting only for labourers or those involved in physical activity because it was difficult to digest and vigorous work would help this process. </p>\n<p>Chicken was regarded more favourably and was specifically recommended by some as a food for the sick, but it was expensive in Shakespeare's time so only the wealthy would eat the bird's flesh. </p>\n<p>In Shakespeare, capons are an indulgence - they are a favourite of Sir John Falstaff , and in The Two Gentlemen of Verona Launce's dog Crab steals a capon-leg from Sylvia's table. </p>\n<p>Boorde thought that beef was \"good meate for an English man\", a view that disagreed with ancient medical authorities such as Galen who believed that beef was a cold and heavy meat that provoked melancholy. </p>\n<p>It was thought that the cold English climate made English stomachs hotter than those of their Mediterranean neighbours and so better able to digest a meat like beef, which was also more tender in England as the cattle fed on pasture. </p>\n<p>In Shakespeare's time beef was thought to stir up courage, something emphasised by classical philosophers and evident in Henry V when the French Constable says of the English soldiers \"give them great meals of beef, and iron and steel, they will eat like wolves and fight like devils\". </p>\n<p>On the other hand, it was believed that beef caused stupidity, something Shakespeare refers to twice - in Twelfth Night when Andrew Aguecheek observes \"Methinks sometimes I have no more wit than a Christian or an ordinary man has; but I am a great eater of beef, and I believe that does harm to my wit\", and in Troilus and Cressida when Ajax curses Thersites: \"The plague of Greece upon thee, thou mongrel beef-witted lord!\" </p>\n<p>Beef might be served in pies, which the English were especially fond of. They also liked pasties, like today's, enclosed in a pastry crust and baked without a dish, which usually had only one filling, venison being a popular choice. </p>\n<p>In The Merry Wives of Windsor Master Page offers a venison pasty to Slender and Sir John Falstaff for dinner. The Lenten pie referred to by Mercutio in Romeo and Juliet wouldn't have contained any meat because Lent was a time for fasting and fish would have taken the place of meat at the dinner table.</p>\n<p>These days we are generally encouraged by health professionals to eat more fish and reduce our intake of red meat but in Shakespeare's time fish was considered inferior to meat. People viewed it as less nourishing, but it was also associated with the Catholic practice of not eating meat on Fridays. </p>\n<p>\"Fish days\" had been introduced by the government for economic reasons, to encourage the fishing industry and bring down the high price of meat, but the fish days were disliked by England's Protestants because they reminded them of England's Catholic past. </p>\n<p>In King Lear the disguised Kent says to Lear: \"I do profess to be no less than I seem, to serve him truly that will put me in trust, to love him that is honest, to converse with him that is wise and says little, to fear judgement, to fight when I cannot choose, and to eat no fish.\" </p>\n<p>This all suggests that Kent is a loyal Protestant and therefore a man who can be trusted. In Shakespeare's Henry IV part 2 Falstaff criticises Hal's sober brother, Prince John. \"There's never none of these demure boys come to any proof; for thin drink doth so overcool their blood, and making many fish meals, that they fall into a kind of male green-sickness; and then when they marry, they get wenches.\" </p>\n<p>\"Green sickness\" was an anaemic disease commonly attributed to a virgin's sexual fantasies that could be cured by a sexual encounter, and by the phrase \"get wenches\" Falstaff means \"produce girl children\". In other words, Falstaff is suggesting that Prince John is weak and effeminate because he is not properly nourished. </p>\n<p>However, Falstaff himself eats fish - a receipt in his pocket shows he has enjoyed \"anchovies and sack [Spanish white wine] after supper\". Anchovies and also herring, preserved in salt or pickled, were commonly sold as snacks in taverns, which would explain why they bother Sir Toby Belch in Twelfth Night (\"A plague o' these pickle herring!\"). While eating fish occasionally or as a snack was fine (at least acceptable to someone like Falstaff), to eat \"many fish meals\" was suspiciously Catholic.</p>\n<p>Animal flesh was preferred over fish and also considered healthier than \"fruit\", a term that included not only what we consider fruit today but also what we consider vegetables. Fruit was believed to be full of water that could cause a harmful imbalance in the body. It was generally believed that before the biblical Flood the human constitution was stronger and fruits contained less moisture but that after the Flood fruit provided less nourishment and made men more vulnerable to disease. </p>\n<p>It was believed to be at this point that God ordained the consumption of animal flesh by humans. Dietary authors advised eating fruit only occasionally, and before meals, avoiding the French habit of eating it after meals (for dessert). </p>\n<p>This is a shortened version of Joan Fitzpatrick's talk, \"'Wolf All?' Shakespeare and Food in Renaissance England,\" for Radio 3's <strong>The Essay</strong>, to be broadcast at 22:45 BST on 27 April - <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006x3hl\" class=\"story-body__link\">catch up on BBC iPlayer</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/timelines/z8k2p39\" class=\"story-body__link\">BBC iWonder - William Shakespeare: The Life and Legacy of England's Bard</a></p>\n<p>But people still ate fruit, which was sold in the streets and markets and picked from bushes and in hedgerows by those who could not afford to buy it or be fussy about what they ate. </p>\n<p>New and fashionable fruits, such as apricots and melons, were being imported into England from southern Europe and dried fruits such as raisins and figs were also available to those who could afford them. </p>\n<p>Pumpkin seeds have been found in excavations of the Rose and Globe playhouses and so it's possible that pumpkins or pumpkin seeds were consumed by wealthier members of the audience. Pumpkins were considered especially watery - in The Merry Wives of Windsor Mistress Ford describes Falstaff as \"this unwholesome humidity, this gross watery pumpkin\". </p>\n<p>For modern readers one of the strangest ideas to emerge from early modern dietary books is the fact that human breast-milk was recommended as a drink for adults as well as children. </p>\n<p>Bullein claims \"the best milk that helpeth against consumptions is woman's milk\". When we recognise this, references to milk and milkiness in the plays begin to make more sense. </p>\n<p>Lady Macbeth worries that her husband is \"too full o' th' milk of human kindness\". The line is clearly figurative, but might there be a literal suggestion too? </p>\n<p>These accusations of milkiness suggest two kinds of weakness - the producers of milk were weak because they were women, and the consumers were the weak, the old, the sick, or babies. </p>\n<p>Milk from animals and other \"white meats\", such as butter and cheese, were usually manufactured by women and they evoked distinct national stereotypes, butter being especially associated with the Dutch and cheese with the Welsh. </p>\n<p>Boorde recommends that butter be eaten \"in the morning before other meats\" (or foods), noting that \"French men will eat it after meat\" and \"Dutch men doth eat it at all times in the day\". </p>\n<p>In The Merry Wives of Windsor Master Ford claims he wouldn't trust a Fleming with his butter but most of the references to butter in this play and in Henry IV part 1 are made by or about Falstaff. In The Merry Wives of Windsor Sir Hugh Evans, conforms to stereotype by looking forward to a dessert of cheese: \"I will make an end of my dinner; there's pippins and cheese to come\". </p>\n<p>Pippins, a variety of apple, were considered difficult to digest, especially if eaten raw and cheese was thought helpful to close the stomach after a meal. Cheese was traditionally a food for the poor but after 1600 it became more fashionable, especially hard cheese that took more time to mature and was imported from abroad.  </p>\n<p>In Shakespeare's time people thought that sugar was healthy, indeed it was used as a medicine to treat lots of conditions such as stomach problems. Boorde approved of all food and drink containing sugar as especially nutritious and it was thought that old people craved sugar.</p>\n<p>Like our ancestors we too believe that some foods are better for us than others, even if we wouldn't agree with them about what those foods are. But we also share with our ancestors the belief that good health, above all other things, is what matters most. </p>\n<p>This year marks 400 years since William Shakespeare's death.

			"title": "BBC What's the difference between a stalker and a super-fan?",
			"date_published": 1461194914,
			"body": "\n<p class=\"story-body__introduction\">Singer Lily Allen has spoken out about her experience of being stalked by a stranger and her treatment by the police. It's not the first time a celebrity has received obsessive attention, but what are the stages that lead to somebody becoming a dangerous stalker?</p>\n<p>Lily Allen was relaxing in her flat last year when a stalker broke in and confronted her in her bedroom.</p>\n<p>\"I'm lying in bed and I can see the door handle moving and then he steams in, starts screaming and shouting... I could see he was really agitated and upset,\" she told the BBC's Newsnight.</p>\n<p>Alex Gray, from Perth, was charged and found guilty of harassment and burglary and is awaiting sentencing.  It was the culmination of an ordeal that started back in 2008 when Gray first contacted Allen on Twitter. Over time he began turning up at her house and office, left abusive notes and made suicide threats.</p>\n<p>Lily Allen is one of a long list of celebrities who have received persistent unwanted attention including singer Joss Stone and Little Mix's Jade Thirlwall. </p>\n<p>Television presenter and journalist Alexis Bowater has been stalked three separate times.</p>\n<p>\"It's extraordinarily psychologically damaging and traps you in an unwanted relationship with somebody that quite often you've never met and never want to meet. You're locked in a relationship with this perpetrator who's trying to control your life.\"</p>\n<p>But Alexis says super-fans and celebrity stalkers have little in common. While they may both have an intense interest in a particular celebrity, this is where the similarity ends.</p>\n<p>\"Stalkers frighten people and fans don't. There is a massive difference between meeting somebody and thinking 'she's quite nice and I'll send her some flowers' and approaching someone persistently doing that and making threats, pursuing and harassing them.\"</p>\n<p>Frank Farnham, consultant forensic psychiatrist at Barnet Enfield and Haringey Mental Health NHS Trust, agrees.</p>\n<p>\"Super-fans are relatively stable. They gain a lot from being in a group of people who like the same person. It's a pro-social behaviour. The super-fans know each other, they go to the same gigs together, they meet up and go for a drink,\" he says.</p>\n<p>\"With stalking, it's an anti-social behaviour. They think they have this special bond and this relationship with the celebrity and none of the other fans matter. When you're breaking into someone's bedroom, that's not the actions of a super-fan.\" </p>\n<p>It's a fundamentally different thing to start harassing people, says Dr Emma Short from Bedfordshire University. \"People with mental health problems who are vulnerable to delusions are the more likely to become stalkers,\" she says.</p>\n<p>\"The fixated celebrity stalker sees everything the celeb does in relationship to themselves. Everything has meaning. So if they are served with a cease and desist letter, they may think the celebrity is trying to contact them in code. </p>\n<p>\"The court process is complicated - for stalkers being in the same room as the celebrity can reinforce their feeling of attachment. Lily Allen spoke on Newsnight about how her stalker locked eyes with her. Being in the same room as her was very important to him.\"</p>\n<p>Celebrity stalkers get a huge amount of press, however they make up just a small part of those committing the criminal activity. Research from the Suzy Lamplugh Trust (which runs the National Stalking Helpline) has found one in five British women and one in 12 British men are victims of stalking during their lifetimes.</p>\n<p>Most celebrities don't know their stalkers, however in 90% of cases victims do know the person harassing them.</p>\n<p>Statistics from the National Stalking Helpline have revealed that 22% of stalkers are acquaintances of the victim, 5% worked or once worked with them, and 4% are family members. The largest group by far is ex-partners, who make up 45% of the total.</p>\n<p>Zoe Dronfield was stalked by a former partner who later attacked her. The mother-of-two from Coventry was left hospitalised with a bleed on her brain and a neck wound following an eight-hour attack. </p>\n<p>Zoe said she received calls, messages and emails and was harassed on social media after they broke up.</p>\n<p>\"There is a serious lack of understanding of stalking and the insidious behaviour behind it because certain incidents in isolation aren't frightening but when it gets to double figures and on a daily basis and you aren't able to function it's really frightening. You think 'what have I done to deserve this'?\"</p>\n<p>As classified by <a href=\"https://www.stalkingriskprofile.com/what-is-stalking/types-of-stalking\" class=\"story-body__link-external\">Australian academics</a> Paul Mullen, Michele Pathe and Rosemary Purcell.</p>\n<p>1: <strong>Rejected stalkers</strong> tend to be former sexual partners, who want to either reconcile or get revenge. They stalk because it allows the stalker to continue to feel close to the victim or allows them to salvage some self-esteem.</p>\n<p>2: <strong>Intimacy seeking stalkers</strong> suffer from loneliness and a lack of a confidante. Victims are usually strangers or acquaintances and the stalkers behaviour is often driven by mental health problems such as delusions. Celebrity stalkers often fall in to this category.</p>\n<p>3: <strong>Resentful stalkers</strong> feel they have been somehow mistreated by the victim and can arise from mental illness where the stalker develops paranoia. </p>\n<p>4: <strong>Predatory stalkers</strong> have deviant sexual interests. Stalking often starts as voyeurism for sexual gratification but can lead to sexual assault. </p>\n<p>5: <strong>Incompetent suitors</strong> want short-term sexual relationships. They usually stalk strangers or acquaintances for short periods. If they do persist they may be blind to the distress this causes and may have conditions that affect their social skills.</p>\n<p>Stalking is \"repeated, unwanted contact that occurs as a result of fixation or obsession and causes the victim(s) to feel distressed and fearful,\" according to the Suzy Lamplugh Trust.</p>\n<p>While the triggers for stalking can vary, the behaviour displayed follows a broadly similar pattern.</p>\n<p>\"It is common for stalking to escalate and get gradually worse over time. Stalkers are by nature obsessive and the longer they do it the more entrenched their fixation becomes,\" says Kristiana Rixon, from the trust.</p>\n<p>\"Stalking doesn't just affect the victim. A stalker typically contacts 21 people known to the victim including friends, family and neighbours. It's important that they don't engage with the stalker either as 5% of stalkers will assault someone known to the victim. Research shows 30 to 40% of victims are also physically assaulted.\"</p>\n<p>You should contact the police if you're being stalked - you have a right to feel safe in your home and workplace. Call 999 if you or someone else is in immediate danger otherwise contact your local police. </p>\n<p>Victims, whether they are celebrities or otherwise, experience a constant sense of dread and anxiety. </p>\n<p>\"I experienced what any other stalking victim would, which is hyper-vigilance,\" Alexis Bowater says.</p>\n<p>\"You know that an attack is imminent and inevitable but you just don't know where or when or who by.  You slowly change all of your behaviours, not all at once. Everything that you do is to make sure you and your family are safe. You spend your whole time expecting to be attacked at any moment.\"</p>\n<p>According to the Suzy Lamplugh Trust 80% of victims of stalking are women. Although women in their early 20s are slightly more likely to be stalked, age isn't a barrier. </p>\n<p>\"We've had cases from women in their 70s to women under the age of 18,\" says Rixon.</p>\n<p>Her advice on how to deal with stalkers is straightforward. </p>\n<p>\"If you are receiving unwanted attention tell them once. If they don't stop you shouldn't respond to them again as they will take this as an acknowledgement. I know this can be hard. You should also keep a record. You can also contact the National Stalking Helpline for advice and you can go to the police and make a report.\"</p>\n<p>The trust has argued that the police need to do more to support stalking victims. They have pointed to research that found only 26.6% of cases had been reported to the police and of those who made a report, 43% had not found the response helpful. </p>\n<p>Police action on stalking differs around the country. While Alexis says the police took her case \"very seriously\", Zoe said she was met with an unsympathetic response.  </p>\n<p>\"My experience of the police was when they first came round was 'you need to find yourself a nice boyfriend in future.' That's really not the attitude to be taking and it's quite an insult to your intelligence. It's exasperating. I felt helpless which is why I felt I had to manage the situation myself.\" </p>\n<p><i>Additional reporting by Jon Kelly</i></p>\n<p>What's it like to be stalked for a decade?

			"body": "\n<p class=\"story-body__introduction\">Elections for police and crime commissioners will take place across most of England and Wales on 5 May. Here is a guide to what PCCs do and how the system, introduced in 2012, works.</p>\n<p>PCCs are elected representatives who work to ensure police forces in England and Wales are running effectively. They replaced police authorities in 2012 and were intended to bring a public voice to policing. </p>\n<p>The government insists PCCs are not there to run local police forces but to hold them to account and respond to the needs of the public. </p>\n<p>There is no PCC in London because the mayor is responsible for policing.</p>\n<p>In the first PCC elections held in November 2012, 192 candidates stood for the 41 posts covering England and Wales. </p>\n<p class=\"ns_super_impact__fig\">15%</p>\n<p>turnout</p>\n<p class=\"ns_super_impact__fig\">192</p>\n<p>candidates</p>\n<p><span class=\"ns_impact__fig\">16</span> Conservatives elected </p>\n<p><span class=\"ns_impact__fig\">13</span> Labour </p>\n<p><span class=\"ns_impact__fig\">12</span> Independents </p>\n<p>Sixteen Conservative PCCs were elected, 13 from Labour and 12 Independents. Among the successful independent candidates were eight former police officers, one of Wales' most senior barristers, and an ex-pilot. Six women were elected (from 35 who stood as candidates) and 35 men.</p>\n<p>In this year's election on 5 May there are 40 votes being held - because Greater Manchester is not holding an election. The region is set to vote for the new post of elected mayor in 2017 and the powers and responsibilities of the PCC will fall to the mayor. Since last May PCC Tony Lloyd, who was elected in 2012, has held the post of interim mayor. </p>\n<p>This time there are 188 candidates standing. Labour and the Conservatives are fielding candidates in each area, with UKIP putting forward 34 candidates and the Liberal Democrats 30. Of those elected in 2012, 26 are standing again, as are two successful candidates from by-elections held in 2014.</p>\n<p>PCCs' responsibilities include: </p>\n<p>Police and crime commissioners cannot tell the police how to do their job - despite having some control over the direction of a force. The operational independence of the police is protected by legislation. </p>\n<p>New measures proposed in the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/policing-and-crime-bill\" class=\"story-body__link-external\">Policing and Crime Bill</a>, which is currently passing through Parliament, would enable PCCs to <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-34224491\" class=\"story-body__link\">take on responsibility for fire and rescue services</a>. The Home Office said it wanted to encourage more \"efficiency and effectiveness\" but the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-35138665\" class=\"story-body__link\">Fire Brigades Union called the idea \"dangerous\"</a> and a \"half-baked suggestion\" and the Local Government Association said it saw no \"pressing need\" for the change.</p>\n<p>Public elections for the first police and crime commissioners took place on 15 November 2012 in 41 police force areas across England and Wales, not including London. The elections - 37 in England and four in Wales - were described as the biggest shake-up of policing for almost 50 years but the turnout was the lowest in peacetime Britain. One polling station in Newport, Gwent, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-20355358\" class=\"story-body__link\">was visited by no voters at all</a>.</p>\n<p>Fewer than 15% of voters turned out in the 41 police areas electing a PCC, prompting the Electoral Commission to hold <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-21836934\" class=\"story-body__link\">a review into how the polls were conducted</a>. The inquiry found 80% of voters felt they did not have enough information to make an informed choice. The commission's chairwoman Jenny Watson said: \"The government took a number of decisions about how to run these elections that we did not agree with.\"</p>\n<p>All registered voters are entitled to take part in the elections. The supplementary vote system is used in all force areas where more than two candidates stand, with voters marking the ballot paper with their first and second choice of candidate. In the 2016 elections there are at least three candidates standing for each post.</p>\n<p>A PCC's term of office is four years, with a maximum of two terms.</p>\n<p>The idea of giving local people more of a say in how the police in their area are run had been championed for years by some Conservatives as a way of boosting local democracy - but it only became party policy at the 2010 general election.  </p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/sites/default/files/resources/coalition_programme_for_government.pdf\" class=\"story-body__link-external\">coalition agreement</a> published after the May 2010 election contained a pledge to make the police \"more accountable through oversight by a directly elected individual\". The proposal was fleshed out in the white paper \"<a href=\"http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/consultations/policing-21st-century/policing-21st-full-pdf?view=Binary\" class=\"story-body__link-external\">Policing in the 21st Century</a>\" and enacted in the <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2012/1129/made\" class=\"story-body__link-external\">Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act</a>, which became law in 2011.</p>\n<p>London has a directly elected mayor, who acts as the police and crime commissioner for the Metropolitan police area. London's police and crime panel is formed from a committee of elected London Assembly members. The commissioner of the Metropolitan Police continues to be a Royal appointment on the advice of the home secretary. </p>\n<p>In 2014 Chancellor George Osborne <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-29876939\" class=\"story-body__link\">announced plans for an elected mayor for Greater Manchester</a> as part of a project to hand more devolved power to the north.</p>\n<p>Manchester's PCC <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-32929721\" class=\"story-body__link\">Tony Lloyd became the city's interim mayor</a> in May 2015, retaining the PCC responsibilities when he transferred to his new role. Mancunians will vote for an elected mayor for the first time in 2017 and, as in London, the mayor will continue to oversee policing.</p>\n<p>PCCs are required to swear an oath of impartiality when they are elected to office. This echoes the commitment police officers make to serve every member of the public impartially. Before the introduction of PCCs, the government promised the way investigations were carried out would not become political.</p>\n<p>PCCs have to answer to the public - the government has said their performance \"should be judged solely by the electorate\" - and more than two-thirds of the commissioners are asking voters to re-elect them in 2016.</p>\n<p>And people can complain to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) if they think their PCC has broken the law.</p>\n<p>In addition to this, Police and Crime Panels were set up in each force area to scrutinise and challenge the actions and decisions of each PCC. A panel may require the attendance of the PCC, has the power to suspend them from office because of a criminal offence, or exercise a veto over a proposed candidate for chief constable. </p>\n<p>But in July 2013, less than a year into the new system, the Home Affairs Select Committee <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-23387324\" class=\"story-body__link\">said it seemed \"very easy\" for a PCC to remove a chief constable for \"insubstantial\" reasons</a> and advised police and crime panels should be more vigorous in analysing contentious decisions by PCCs, such as the sacking of a chief constable.</p>\n<p>In England, panels are mainly made up of representatives from each local authority in a police force area. In Wales, they are free-standing public bodies, set up and maintained by the secretary of state, rather than local authority committees.</p>\n<p>When the role was introduced, ministers insisted the cost of PCCs and police and crime panels must be no greater than the abolished police authorities. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-22624096\" class=\"story-body__link\">In 2013, BBC research</a> revealed the salaries of the majority of the PCCs were between £70,000 and £85,000, although the commissioners overseeing the three major forces of Greater Manchester, West Yorkshire and West Midlands were each receiving £100,000. It was also calculated that PCCs across England and Wales had employed at least 449 people in the six months after their introduction.</p>\n<p>Salaries are recommended by the Senior Salaries Review Body, which advises on the remuneration of those in public office, and approved by the home secretary.</p>\n<p>During the first year PCCs were in office, there were four investigations carried out by the IPCC, as well as investigations by the CPS into expenses claims. And MPs on the Home Affairs Committee <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-22636857\" class=\"story-body__link\">warned ministers were failing to properly monitor the salaries</a> and standards of PCCs.</p>\n<p>In 2014, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-29220535\" class=\"story-body__link\">South Yorkshire's PCC Shaun Wright resigned</a> over the Rotherham child abuse scandal. He had faced demands to step down in the wake of a report that found at least 1,400 children were abused in the town from 1997 to 2013. Mr Wright, who had been the head of children's services in Rotherham between 2005 and 2010, eventually said he was stepping down as PCC to ensure the \"important issues\" outlined in the report could be discussed and considered \"without distraction\".</p>\n<p>Home Secretary Theresa May had called for Mr Wright to stand down and - in the few days before he did so - the controversy prompted then Deputy Prime Minister and Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg, whose party helped pass the legislation that created PCCs, to describe the role as a \"discredited experiment\" and <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-29172812\" class=\"story-body__link\">say PCCs should be abolished</a>.</p>\n<p>Just three months after being elected Lincolnshire PCC Alan Hardwick suspended his temporary chief constable Neil Rhodes over an employment dispute. But <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-lincolnshire-21964844\" class=\"story-body__link\">a judicial review into the suspension ruled in favour of Mr Rhodes</a>, with a judge calling the suspension \"irrational and perverse\", and he was reinstated. The row also saw the chairman of the crime panel stand down. Speaking at the time, Mr Hardwick, who is not standing for re-election, said he accepted the judge's decision and added: \"The rules governing PCCs don't really envisage this sort of thing, there is more guidance needed.\"</p>\n<p>Kent PCC Ann Barnes, an Independent, has been a controversial figure during her tenure and announced in March she <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-kent-35794996\" class=\"story-body__link\">would not be standing for re-election</a>. A report last year found she <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-kent-34647110\" class=\"story-body__link\">may not have been properly insured</a> when she was in a car crash and she was criticised for <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-kent-27478691\" class=\"story-body__link\">taking part in a documentary</a> and for her appointments of youth commissioners. In a <a href=\"http://kent-pcc.gov.uk/home.php?entry_id=1457787639\" class=\"story-body__link-external\">statement on her website</a> when she said she would not be standing in the 2016 election, Ms Barnes said the people of Kent had been getting a better service and added: \"I am content that I have delivered what I said I would.\"</p>\n<p>Cumbria's PCC, Richard Rhodes, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-22220707\" class=\"story-body__link\">apologised for using a chauffeur-driven ca</a>r that cost £700 of taxpayers' money for just two trips and admitted he had failed to check how much it would cost. The former head teacher paid the money back and said at the time he understood the public concern over the case. Cumbria Police arrested three people in connection with leaking the information but no charges were brought. Mr Rhodes is not standing for re-election.</p>\n<p>When he was just over six months into the role Bob Jones, the West Midlands PCC, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-birmingham-22797713\" class=\"story-body__link\">said PCCs should be scrapped</a> and replaced with something more efficient and less party political. Mr Jones <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-birmingham-28108283\" class=\"story-body__link\">died in July 2014</a> aged 59 and a by-election was held to replace him the following month. The turnout for the by-election was just 10.4% - lower than the 12% in the West Midlands in 2012 - and the cost of the poll was estimated at £3.7m, nearly £20 for every vote cast.</p>\n<p>Supporters argue that elected commissioners make policing more accountable and responsive to local needs because, for example, they consult with victims of crime when setting policing priorities. They also say PCCs bring valuable outside experience to forces.</p>\n<p>Home secretary Theresa May, who introduced the role, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/police-and-crime-commissioners-the-choice-is-yours\" class=\"story-body__link-external\">says PCCs \"have engaged with the public</a> over the past three-and-a-half years in ways that police authorities never did or could\".</p>\n<p>In 2012 opponents warned PCCs could lead to the politicisation of the police, with commissioners favouring headline-grabbing initiatives. They also feared commissioners could interfere with the running of police forces. </p>\n<p>Critics have also questioned whether PCCs have real legitimacy following the low turnout of just over 15% in the 2012 elections.</p>\n<p>Police authorities, first established in 1964 to hold chief constables to account, had oversight of the police before PCCs. They were made up of local councillors and independent, appointed members. But the coalition government concluded police authorities were \"invisible\" and needed replacing with elected commissioners and police and crime panels. </p>"

It will resettle children and their families \"where the UNHCR deems resettlement is in the best interests of the child.\"</p>\n<p>Several hundred people are expected to be resettled in the UK by April 2017 \"with a view to resettling up to 3,000 over the lifetime of this Parliament\", the government said. </p>\n<p>The five-year Syrian civil war has created more than 4.5 million refugees across the region - half of them children in need of food, education and a home. The UN has warned that a <a href=\"http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=53145#.VxjLOPn4-Uk\" class=\"story-body__link-external\">whole generation of Syrian children is at risk</a>.</p>\n<p>Immigration Minister James Brokenshire said:  \"We have always been clear that the vast majority of vulnerable children are better off remaining in host countries in the region so they can be reunited with surviving family members. However, there are exceptional circumstances in which it is in a child's best interests to be resettled in the UK. </p>\n<p> \"We have engaged with a number of NGOs, including the UNHCR on the best way to provide protection to refugee children and ensure their welfare and safety remain at the heart of every decision made.\"</p>\n<p>The scheme will be reviewed after two years.</p>\n<p>The announcement was welcomed by Children's Commissioner for England Anne Longfield, who said the children would get the \"vital protection and support they need\" in the UK.</p>\n<p>But Yvette Cooper, chairwoman of Labour's Refugee Taskforce, said the announcement included \"nothing new to help the thousands of child refugees alone in Europe who are at risk of trafficking, sexual exploitation and abuse\". </p>\n<p>\"Children are risking their lives every day making dangerous journeys, and Europol estimate at least 10,000 children have disappeared in the crisis, many trafficked into prostitution and modern slavery. Many children are sleeping rough or in makeshift camps because children's homes are full, and many have been sexually abused and exploited too.\"</p>\n<p>And Lib Dem leader Tim Farron suggested that the move was a \"cynical\" ploy - a bid to \"buy off\" Conservative backbenchers ahead of a Commons vote on the issue of unaccompanied children in the camps      next week.</p>\n<p>He told the BBC the announcement would not help the 30,000 unaccompanied children who have made it to Europe already but are at risks in camps:  \"Of those 30,000, 10,000 have gone missing. David Cameron has the ability, should he wish to do so, to step in and prevent these children who are go missing into the hands of child sexual exploiters, human traffickers... And yet once again he's failed to take the opportunity.\" </p>\n<p>And Labour's Lord Dubs, who moved the amendment to the Immigration Bill calling on the government to take in 3,000 child refugees already in Europe, said: \"While I welcome this proposal, it doesn't deal sufficiently with the substance of my amendment.\"</p>\n<p>\"You also have to wonder whether the use of the 3,000 figure is a deliberate ploy to muddy the debate.\" </p>\n<p>The government has already committed to resettle another 20,000 Syrian refugees under the Vulnerable Persons Resettlement Scheme, 1,000 of whom have already arrived, including more than 500 children.</p>"

But what is it like to play one of the most famous faces in the world - and what makes so many want to do so? </p>\n<p>Playing the Queen could be daunting for many actresses. But two who have done exactly that on stage say there is one crucial element for getting into character - the wig.</p>\n<p>Emma Handy played Liz - the 1980s version of the Queen - in the recent touring production of Moira Buffini play Handbagged, which imagines older and younger versions of the Queen and Margaret Thatcher in conversation during their weekly audience. </p>\n<p>\"The wig and make-up and clothes do so much,\" she says. \"It's extraordinary.\" </p>\n<p>But, adds Handy: \"She seems to have two faces - the public and the private face. There is very little footage of her private life, but she is known to be enormously mischievous - and these are things I have in common with her.\"   </p>\n<p>One thing Handy was adamant about was not doing an impersonation of the Queen - instead she focused on capturing her \"essence\". She says she found sitting \"incredibly straight-backed\" helped. </p>\n<p>\"She's probably the most photographed person in the world, so everyone has an idea of her,\" says Handy. </p>\n<p>\"Every year you see the Christmas broadcast, but that's not who she is. There is a massive side of her people don't know.\"</p>\n<p>Marion Bailey, who played Q - the older Queen - in the West End production, says: \"It is irresistible to play the Queen. When I was cast, I mentioned it to a few people and someone said I didn't look anything like the Queen. </p>\n<p>\"And I replied: 'Oh, but I do,'\". I've often sat in make-up chairs and had my hair in a particular way, looked in the mirror and thought: 'You know what? I could do the Queen,'.\"</p>\n<p>In preparation for the London run of the play, initially at the Tricycle Theatre before transferring to the Vaudeville Theatre, she says she watched all the Queen's Christmas messages - as well as anything else she could find online. </p>\n<p>And the reaction was everything she could have hoped for. </p>\n<p>\"Some nights I would walk out and there would be gasps,\" she says. \"It was to do with the look of it and the history, and I tried to get as many of the mannerisms as I could. On the West End transfer, I heard an American tourist whisper: 'Is that the Queen?'.\"  </p>\n<p>Prof Philip Murphy, director of the Institute of Commonwealth Studies at the University of London, says the closest the public ever got to seeing the real Queen was in the 1969 documentary Royal Family.</p>\n<p>But Prof Murphy says: \"The Royal Family effectively suppressed it. They decided it reduced the mystique around them. </p>\n<p>\"In a way, that creates a carte blanche for writers and satirists to make up personalities.\"</p>\n<p>He adds: \"That's the problem the Royal Family has - they want to appear human but they also want to appear somehow removed and keep this dignified distance.\"</p>\n<p>One issue with writing about the Queen is that \"fact and fiction gets mixed up\", he says. </p>\n<p>\"The public have very little sense of what actually goes on. But a plausible fictional representation can almost seep into historical record.\"</p>\n<p>Portrayals of the Queen have not always been the most flattering, he notes.</p>\n<p>\"Spitting Image was an attack on British deference around authority figures - and there were no more esteemed than the Royal Family,\" says the professor.  </p>\n<p>One of the lead writers of that series was author John O'Farrell, who says: \"If you cast your mind back to the 1980s, there was an enormous reverential style. It was seen as poor form to laugh at the Queen's expense... But what we did was show her to be an ordinary person in an ordinary family, which is where it struck a comic nerve,\" he says.</p>\n<p>He adds: \"The tabloids faked outrage, but people loved it... At times it was crude and disrespectful - but I think that's warranted.\"</p>\n<p>Alison Jackson is someone else whose work has attracted controversy. Her apparently candid photographs of celebrities in private moments are created with the help of carefully-chosen lookalikes. </p>\n<p>Thanks to Jackson, we see \"the Queen\" putting out dog food for her corgis, taking a selfie and doing the washing-up. </p>\n<p>\"I thought it would be really good to get her doing normal things,\" says Jackson. </p>\n<p>\"She is a person, after all. And she does do normal things - she reads, she drives a Land Rover, she gets her hands dirty - she's quite tomboyish, really. She's not a diva and seems to come across as a normal woman, even though of course she's not.\"</p>\n<p>Jackson says one photograph seems to be seen as going too far, however. </p>\n<p>\"My photograph of the Queen on the loo is my least published. I don't think it's been seen in any newspaper in England, whereas a lot of other works get published all the time,\" she says.</p>\n<p>\"People think breaking that taboo is tasteless, which I find interesting. But it's designed to be thought-provoking, rather than controversial.\"</p>\n<p>Thought provoking as they may be, perhaps fictional representations get us no closer to who the Queen actually is - barring of course the only time she has played herself, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/xW5abat5NEU\" class=\"story-body__link-external\">acting alongside Daniel Craig in a James Bond sketch</a> for the London Olympics opening ceremony in 2012. </p>\n<p>But that certainly isn't going to stop people from continuing to try to capture the essence of this elusive, yet ever-present, figure. </p>"

A large number of aftershocks followed, including one that measured 7.3 on 12 May 2015. Photographer Alison Baskerville travelled to Nepal with Handicap International UK to meet young people whose lives were changed forever by those events.</strong></p>\n<p>Uma Silwal (right) was at home with her family when the earthquake hit.  </p>\n<p>\"We were sitting having lunch and the ground started to shake,\" she says. \"At first we just froze, we had no idea what to do. Then we ran. I don't remember the wall landing on me. I just remember seeing everyone running ahead in front of me.\"  </p>\n<p>At the time of the earthquake Uma was studying engineering. Her father had just retired from a long career in the Nepalese Fire Service and was adjusting to life at home with a reduced income. </p>\n<p>\"I knew I had to get educated and find work so I could help support my family,\" Uma says.  </p>\n<p>The earthquake destroyed their home. As well as looking after her family, Uma's mother has been involved in rebuilding their house, and feeding the workers. </p>\n<p>\"My mother does so much,\" says Uma. \"Sometimes I worry that we take her for granted. She is the closest person to me and keeps our family together.\"  </p>\n<p>Uma later decided to change her degree to social work. \"I had a few choices ahead of me before the earthquake. It felt like with two legs I have two paths to take.  </p>\n<p>\"After the quake I only have one leg but it's also given me one clear path. To help those who are like me.\"</p>\n<p>Amrit Magar was sleeping in his room in the Pepsicola district of Kathmandu when the earthquake hit.  </p>\n<p>With both parents at work he was home alone and unsure what to do. He tried to run from the house but as he escaped the building collapsed and he was buried in rubble. </p>\n<p>Neighbours managed to pulled him free and he was taken to hospital.  </p>\n<p>\"When the wall fell I was unconscious. When I woke up I thought my legs were fine,\" he says. </p>\n<p>But Amrit remained in a fracture ward until the decision was made to remove one of his legs because it was so badly damaged.   </p>\n<p>\"I loved football before my accident but now I like to read and I want to go back to school,\" says Amrit. </p>\n<p>His father says they can no longer keep Amrit at home as they cannot afford the taxi fares for him to go to the local clinic.  </p>\n<p>Amrit's brother Amish (middle) spent four weeks by his side in hospital.</p>\n<p>His mother, Chandra Kala Magar, holds a family photograph that was recovered from the home. They now live in a temporary home built by the family's employer. </p>\n<p>Ramesh Khatri, then 18, was trapped under rubble for almost three days. When he was eventually pulled free he was rushed to the already overcrowded Bir hospital in Kathmandu. He kept his badly damaged legs for almost five days before doctors decided they should both be amputated.  </p>\n<p>\"I just had to accept this new life I have been given without my legs. It has not been easy but I'm really trying to start again and adapt to my new life,\" he says.</p>\n<p>Ramesh uses the walkway at the National Disability Fund clinic in Kathmandu to train on his prosthetics.  </p>\n<p>Although he has become highly skilled in his wheelchair, he is now focusing on his walking.  </p>\n<p>A few days after breaking his third wheelchair, Ramesh decided to take part in a 3km race in the city. </p>\n<p>With bloodied hands and sweat on his brow, Ramesh pushed himself to sixth place out of 21. \"Next year I'm going to win this race,\" he shouted as he received his finishing medal.</p>\n<p>\"He is ever the optimist,\" says Samrat Singh Basnet, the owner of the hostel where Ramesh lives. \"He's always there in the clinic, helping and encouraging people.\"</p>\n<p>\"I want to study first and then I want to be a social worker to help other people like me,\" says Ramesh. \"Whatever happened, happened. This is our future. We should start from here. We can start again even with our disability.\"</p>\n<p>Sandesh was on his lunch break at the Nepal Police School when the earth began to shake. Along with his classmates he fled from the room where they were.   </p>\n<p>But the outside wall collapsed on top of him, pinning him to the ground.  </p>\n<p>\"We were going to hide under the beds but then we decided to run,\" says Sandesh. \"Then the wall fell down on me. I was unconscious until I got to hospital.\"</p>\n<p>He too lost his legs because of the injuries he sustained. In hospital, he also received the terrible news that his best friend had been killed. </p>\n<p>After almost nine months at home Sandesh has now returned to the police school.  </p>\n<p>He is the only student with a disability and the school have tried their best to accommodate him. But there is a steep slope between the classrooms and accommodation blocks, which makes it difficult for Sandesh to move between the two areas. He stays in the classroom area throughout the school day. </p>\n<p>During his time in hospital he says he lost motivation and found it difficult to accept his condition. With help from therapists and fellow patient Ramesh, he was able to come to terms with his disability. </p>\n<p>He began using a wheelchair, later also using crutches, until he received his prosthetic legs. \"I thought I would never walk again,\" he says. \"When I stood up for the first time I was so happy.\"</p>\n<p class=\"story-body__introduction\">All photographs © Alison Baskerville / Handicap International</p>"

			"body": "\n<p class=\"story-body__introduction\">A record number of people have applied to join the French police force over the past year. Many new recruits say the recent attacks in Paris inspired them to sign up. It also seems that the shootings have made the country rethink its attitude towards the police.</p>\n<p>A young recruit pushes away a woman charging at her with a club. The recruit draws her revolver. \"Police! Don't move!\" she yells. </p>\n<p>Audrey is taking part in a self-defence class at the police training school in Sens, eastern France, having signed up after gunmen attacked the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo and a Jewish supermarket at the start of 2015.  </p>\n<p>\"Since the [Paris] terror attacks in January and November last year, the danger confronting us is clear,\" she says. \"Any one of us can be a victim. Every one of us needs protection. And we all want to help somehow. That's why I'm here. To help make this country safer.\" </p>\n<p>In March this year, a record 35,000 people sat the exam to join the police - 50% more than last year. </p>\n<p>Only 8% of those who took the test passed - the same success level as for the entrance exam for the elite Science-Po political science school in Paris.  </p>\n<p>\"I was really shocked by the video from the Charlie Hebdo killings of the policeman who was on the ground, asking for mercy, who they shot in cold blood,\" says another recruit, Perez, when I ask him why he joined the police.  </p>\n<p>\"That made me want to defend our republic, defend our nation even more. In the morning we'll wake up and know that maybe today we'll risk our lives but we're more motivated than ever,\" he says.  </p>\n<p>The policeman Perez is talking about was called Ahmed Merabet, and the next recruit I talk to shares the same first name. </p>\n<p>\"I'm of Algerian origin,\" he says. \"We had a lot of terrorism in Algeria when I was growing up. I remember the curfews when we went there on holiday. When the Bataclan happened in November I remembered Algeria, and in December I joined the police.\"</p>\n<p>Three of the victims in the Charlie Hebdo and kosher supermarket attacks were police officers, and the live TV coverage of their colleagues storming the shop to save hostages led many to see them as heroes.  </p>\n<p>Then, in November, the first man to confront the attackers inside the Bataclan concert hall in Paris was an off-duty police officer who happened to be passing. He entered the building and shot one of the gunmen dead with his service revolver. A few days later police stormed a flat in St Denis, just north of the city, killing the suspected ringleader. </p>\n<p>\"The terror attacks are a decisive factor for many in our new intake,\" says the director of the training college, Jacques Richard.</p>\n<p>\"I think these young people are discovering a sense of duty and the desire to help their fellow human beings.</p>\n<p>\"When something like this happens, people pull together. Everyone wants to make their own contribution. There's been a big increase in the number of people volunteering to give blood, for example. And more people have wanted to join the emergency services and the police. It's had a big influence on the way people think.\" </p>\n<p>The image of the police in France has changed significantly over the past 20 years. The 1995 film <i>La Haine</i>, a hit both at the box-office and with the critics, portrayed the police as sadistic and racist. </p>\n<p>\"It's an anti-police film,\" explained Mathieu Kassovitz, who won the best director prize for the movie at Cannes that year. When the cast climbed the famous festival steps, the police on duty there turned their backs in protest.</p>\n<p>The police have had an extremely negative image in France for centuries, says historian Jean-Marc Berliere, who's written several books about them.  </p>\n<p>\"Even in Louis XIV's time the people loathed the police,\" he says. \"In the public imagination the police meant repression and the limitation of freedom.\" </p>\n<p>A defining moment was May 1968 when police and rioting students fought pitched battles around Paris's Sorbonne University. That revolutionary movement spread to workers bringing the French economy to a virtual standstill for two weeks. Violence erupted when President Charles de Gaulle tried to sort things out by sending in the police. </p>\n<p>But the media always had a soft-spot for the paving-stone-hurling students.  </p>\n<p>But four days after the Charlie Hebdo massacre, something extraordinary happened. People filled the streets of Paris to show their sympathy for the the victims and demonstrate their support for the police. A <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duCIpdE-Q6I&amp;list=RDduCIpdE-Q6I\" class=\"story-body__link-external\">video posted on YouTube</a> captures the moment. </p>\n<p>The crowd parts. There are women running - some of them laughing. \"What's going on?\" says the man filming with his smartphone. And then, police - in vans and on foot. Their black rubber shoulder protection giving them the kind of silhouettes usually associated with science fiction heroes. And the crowd starts to chant, \"<i>Merci, merci</i>\" - Thank you, thank you.</p>\n<p>\"I couldn't believe it,\" says Jean-Marc Berliere who was there. \"Here was a young, urban, intellectual crowd applauding the police! I saw women giving them flowers. I saw people shaking their hands. I saw women kissing them. And you could see how moved the police were. It was so unexpected.\"</p>\n<p>For Audrey, it made her realise that \"this job is, in fact, fantastic\".</p>\n<p>Something like this had happened only once before, says Berliere, at the liberation of Paris in August 1944. The police were the first to rise up against the Germans before the Allies got there. \"Afterwards, when they marched, the crowds shouted '<i>Vive les flics!</i>' - Long live the cops!\" he says.</p>\n<p>It's not clear if the police's popularity will last, or if it will sag like a souffle in a police canteen. </p>\n<p>A video of a police officer hitting a young black demonstrator at a recent demonstration against labour reforms has not helped their image. Neither has a book by renowned anthropologist Didier Fassin, La Force de l'Ordre (Security Forces). He was allowed to follow the police in one part of the Paris region from 2005 to 2007 and reports widespread brutality and racism. </p>\n<p>But, for the time being at least, a significant part of the French population is seeing the police in a new way. As heroes.</p>\n<p><i>Subscribe to the </i><a href=\"https://ssl.bbc.co.uk/newsletters/newsmagazine?ptrt=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine\" class=\"story-body__link\">BBC News Magazine's email newsletter</a><i> to get articles sent to your inbox.</i></p>"

			"body": "\n<p class=\"story-body__introduction\">Australian federal MP Dennis Jensen is not the first politician to produce a racy thriller. One-time British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd has penned some breathless prose, as has the former Queensland Premier Peter Beattie. </p>\n<p>Dr Jensen, though, may be the first to lose his job, as he sees it, over a novel containing one steamy sex scene.</p>\n<p>A conservative Liberal Party backbencher, Dr Jensen is an outspoken opponent of same-sex marriage and a climate change sceptic. He boycotted the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/7241965.stm\" class=\"story-body__link\">2008 apology</a> to the Stolen Generations, and sparked outrage recently when he said taxpayers should not be funding the \"noble savage\" lifestyles of remote Aboriginal communities.</p>\n<p>His views endeared him to a group of powerbrokers from the party's evangelical Christian wing, whose support he was counting on to help him contest his Perth seat of Tangney at a federal election due later this year.</p>\n<p>However, when local Liberals met earlier this month to choose a candidate for Tangney, the MP was cast aside - by a humiliating 57 to seven votes - in favour of Ben Morton, the party's former state director. </p>\n<p>An angry Dr Jensen blamed a \"smear campaign\", allegedly mounted in collusion with The Australian, which days earlier had <a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/mp-dennis-jensen-used-official-stationery-to-spruik-his-novel/news-story/13b83249b32296ddd8027921ef11f447\" class=\"story-body__link-external\">revealed the existence of his book</a>, The Skywarriors, about an imaginary war between Australia and an Indonesian regime briefly backed by China.</p>\n<p>The newspaper reported that the 54-year-old used his parliamentary letterhead when writing to a Sydney literary agent in 2007 seeking a publishing deal. </p>\n<p>It also reproduced a scene from his book following the downing of an Australian warplane in the Indian Ocean. A fictional Indonesian dictator, Rajiv Rono, tells his mistress, Yasmine, that \"those arrogant Australians won't know what has hit them!\" He then rips off her blouse, \"completely ignoring her protests\", and enjoys \"the fruits of his victory\". </p>\n<p>The story was enthusiastically picked up by the rest of the Australian media. Then came a second article in which The Australian reported that Dr Jensen had \"recently left the family home... to live about 60km away [outside Tangney] with his new girlfriend\".</p>\n<p>\"It was a one-two shot against me,\" Dr Jensen told the BBC. </p>\n<p>\"One, he's a purveyor of smut. Two, he's abandoned his wife and kids to shack up with his new girlfriend. This was a very well organised, well co-ordinated strike, aimed with laser precision at my religious supporters, and it was quite effective in scaring them off.</p>\n<p>\"In fact, my wife left me in July 2014. She lived in the electorate home. I lived down at our holiday home. I met my current girlfriend, and we've been together subsequently, in November 2014. So none of that stuff was current.\"</p>\n<p>How does the sex scene in Dennis Jensen's The Skywarriors stack up against raunchy writing from politicians across the world? </p>\n<p>\"Flushed with the excitement of the moment, Rono felt that he just had to relieve himself. He violently pulled Yasmine's blouse buttons apart, completely ignoring her protests. Yasmine didn't believe in wearing bras; in fact, she didn't really need to\" - Dennis Jensen in The Skywarriors.</p>\n<p>\"She gently picked up his hand and guided it to their ecstasy\" - former Queensland Premier Peter Beattie in The Year of the Dangerous Ones.</p>\n<p>\"The din from the party mocked me as Karen attacked my surly worm with gusto\" - Australian Labor Party MP Graham Perrett in The Twelfth Fish.</p>\n<p>\"Suddenly the pouting sex kitten gave way to Diana the Huntress. She rolled onto him and somehow was sitting athwart his chest, her knees pinning his shoulders. 'Tell me, or I will make you do terrible things,' she hissed\" - Former US Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich in 1945.</p>\n<p>\"On that night of 12 May 1994, I needed that love Cherie gave me, selfishly. I devoured it to give me strength. I was an animal following my instinct\" - Tony Blair in his autobiography, A Journey.</p>\n<p>Dr Jensen is now suing The Australian for defamation - an action which prompted one columnist to hail him as \"that rarest of unpublished authors, who sues a publisher for publishing material, the publication of which he had previously actively sought\". </p>\n<p>In another paradoxical move last week, the MP self-published a Kindle edition of The Skywarriors, meaning that a work subject to a defamation claim is now available on Amazon for anyone with a spare A$6.51 ($5.07; £3.54).</p>\n<p>Even at that price, readers expecting a raunchy read may well feel cheated. The book contains just one sex scene: the 154-word, toe-curling encounter already reprinted by multiple news outlets. When two fighter pilots subsequently get together, we learn only of their \"voyage of gentle and passionate discovery\". </p>\n<p>And apart from mention of an Australian oil worker engrossed in Penthouse just before his rig is attacked by Indonesia off the Kimberley coast, that is it.</p>\n<p>Instead, the novel serves up page upon page of technical detail about combat aircraft and radar systems, along with characters such as Australian pilot Jenny Peters, whose athletic physique indicates she is \"unlikely to have weight problems later in life\" and whose \"shapely calves need no assistance from any stocking\".</p>\n<p>A former submarine operations researcher with the federal government's Defence Science and Technology Organisation (now Group), Dr Jensen calls The Skywarriors - which he wrote in 2002, two years before entering parliament - a techno-thriller, after the genre pioneered by Tom Clancy. </p>\n<p>The MP's father, who is a journalist and author, advised him that every book needs at least one passage of graphic sex to get published, he says. However, after completing The Skywarriors, Dr Jensen - a member of the joint standing parliamentary committee on foreign affairs, defence and trade - decided not to pursue his quest for a publisher, fearing that it might harm Australia's relations with Indonesia and China.</p>\n<p>So why self-publish it now? </p>\n<p>\"The plot is out in the public domain now, so the damage is done. And I thought I might have a shot at seeing if it would sell. Also to put the record straight and show it's not a work of erotica, as The Australian portrayed it.\"</p>\n<p>Dr Jensen, who has held the safe Liberal seat for nearly 12 years, insists the candidate selection battle was \"on a knife edge\" until the negative articles appeared. </p>\n<p>In truth, despite him winning record majorities, he has never been popular with local Liberals, who tried to dump him in 2006 and again in 2009. The first time, then Prime Minister John Howard intervened; the second, the party's state council stepped in. This time, it seems that there is no-one willing to save him. </p>\n<p>Now Dr Jensen is \"done with\" the Liberal Party, whose MPs are expected to confine themselves to \"branch stacking, fundraising and brainless conformity\", he claims. And while he is considering standing as an independent, he believes the recent publicity has probably ruined his chances.</p>\n<p>Does an alternative career as a fiction writer appeal? </p>\n<p>\"It would, but I know it's extremely difficult to make a living. For every Wilbur Smith you've got thousands that haven't made a penny or certainly not enough to support themselves.\" </p>"

But the evidence pointed to them not being afraid to use guns themselves to expand their influence. </p>\n<p>\"They wanted to move up in the criminal world from regional to international gangsters. The group was motivated by profit, so we can only speculate that some of these weapons would have been sold to whoever had the means to pay the asking price.\"</p>\n<p>After Shilling and Defraine were found guilty of conspiring to import and sell the weapons, the judge, Mr Justice Topolski, told them they both faced the possibility of life sentences.</p>\n<p>\"Criminals like you at or near the top of criminal organisations invariably pose a serious danger to the public,\" he said. </p>\n<p>A life sentence would come in for \"serious consideration\", he added.</p>\n<p>David Payne, 43, Richard Rye, 24, and Christopher Owen, 30, had already pleaded guilty to smuggling the weapons into the country. </p>\n<p>Payne and Rye also admitted the second count relating to conspiracy to sell the arsenal.</p>\n<p>All five will be sentenced on 13 May. </p>\n<p>The guns - 22 assault rifles similar to AK-47s, and nine Skorpion sub-machine guns - were brought into the UK from Boulogne on a 38ft (12m) cruiser, the MV Albernina, the court heard.</p>\n<p>All had originally been deactivated but were reactivated before they, along with a large amount of ammunition, were smuggled up the Medway into Kent, arriving near Cuxton Marina on 10 August last year.</p>\n<p>But detectives had the plotters under surveillance and swooped to seize the cache before it could be buried and then sold, the court heard.</p>\n<p>The court heard each of the 22 Czech-made assault rifles would have fetched up to £4,000, even though they were sold at \"shockingly low\" prices in Eastern Europe.</p>\n<p>The Skorpion machine guns, originally developed for use by Czech special forces, would have netted £3,500 apiece.</p>\n<p>On 11 August, the gang was seen by investigators unloading the cruiser, the jury was told, and a number of large heavy bags were loaded into a white van which was driven away by Payne. </p>\n<p>Shilling and Defraine were arrested outside a branch of the DIY store Homebase, where they had just bought spades and other tools, the court heard.</p>"

			"body": "\n<p class=\"story-body__introduction\">Mitsubishi Motors has admitted rigging data on some of its models' fuel efficiency. About 625,000 cars sold in Japan were affected, and the production of the relevant models has been halted. </p>\n<p>The inaccurate tests involved 157,000 of its own cars - the ek Wagon and eK Space - as well as 468,000 vehicles produced for Nissan - the Dayz and Dayz Roox.</p>\n<p>Car companies try to outdo each other on how fuel-efficient their models are. It impresses consumers because it's good for the environment, and it's easy on the wallet at the petrol station. </p>\n<p>Fuel efficiency is tested by putting cars on what is essentially a treadmill where they run at a certain speed and fuel consumption is measured. </p>\n<p>Mitsubishi appears to have overinflated the tyres, which gave better results on the fuel efficiency test.</p>\n<p>Imagine inflating your bicycle tyres to the maximum and going up a hill, then letting half the air out and going up the same hill again. It's much harder. The extra muscle you need gives you an idea of the extra fuel that a car would burn through. </p>\n<p>The controversy comes hard on the heels of the Volkswagen emissions scandal but is slightly different. </p>\n<p>Volkswagen installed hidden software in its diesel models that detected when an official emissions test was being conducted. The software would then lower the emission so the test readings were more favourable. </p>\n<p>So VW rigged the level of harmful gases coming from the exhaust pipe to make their cars look greener than they were. </p>\n<p>Mitsubishi rigged the fuel consumption readings so their cars would appear to use less fuel than they actually did. </p>\n<p>Mitsubishi is a somewhat confusing brand. There are a whole host of independent companies that share the name and trace their origins back to the original Mitsubishi company founded in 1870 in the shipping industry. </p>\n<p>The current companies though are entirely independent from each other. </p>\n<p>That means you will find the name in aviation, banking, air conditioners, the nuclear and chemical industry, optics and of course, cars. </p>\n<p>Mitsubishi Motors is the sixth biggest car maker in Japan and number 16 worldwide. </p>\n<p>Large-scale production got under way in the 1960s. In 1977 the company entered the European market and in 1982 the US market. Annual car production currently stands at 1,218,853 vehicles. </p>\n<p>The current scandal is at Mitsubishi Motors. Any damage to the brand name though, might spill over to the other companies. </p>\n<p>It's not the first time that Mitsubishi Motors has been in the headlines for misconduct. </p>\n<p>In the early 2000s, the company had to admit to lying about defects in its cars for decades.</p>\n<p>Back then, an internal investigation found that the firm had covered up faults since 1977 and repaired cars secretly, instead of reporting the problems to the transport ministry. </p>\n<p>The cover-up led to huge recalls, criminal charges against several employees and a cost of billions to the company. </p>"

Doing so in proximity to an airfield or aircraft is both illegal and clearly irresponsible.\"</p>\n<p>It has not been confirmed that the plane was hit by a drone, with transport minister Robert Goodwill telling parliament that \"there's some speculation it may have even been a plastic bag or something\".</p>\n<p>Current rules state that drones must</p>\n<p>Drones will be banned from flying in large parts of London <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-36083916\" class=\"story-body__link\">during the visit of the US President Barack Obama</a> from 21 April until 24 April.</p>\n<p>Tech start-up SkySafe has recently unveiled technology that allows law enforcement agencies to hijack a drone's controls and neutralise it.</p>\n<p>\"We fully take control of the drone from the operator, it sees us as the legitimate controller, and we can move it to a safe location and land it,\" co-founder Grant Jordan told The Verge tech news website.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile tech firm Battelle has released a radio jammer dubbed Drone Defender which also allows users to steal control of a drone from its owner. The device can currently only be used by government agencies.</p>\n<p>In Japan, in response to a drone that landed a tiny piece of radioactive sand on the roof of the home of the Japanese prime minister, unmanned vehicles with nets have been deployed to catch rogue devices.</p>\n<p>And the UK's Metropolitan Police has said that it is considering using eagles to intercept drones, following trials in the Netherlands.</p>"
