			"body": "You will finally realize making a 'search engine' on zeronet doesn't treat the root causes.\nAll of so-called 'search engines' in ZeroNet are actually indexes, which is not capable to provide full-text search in *complete* site content, as the space/computing power is limited.\nBTW, don't read my blog, I think the articles I wrote before are shit.\n\n\nDeveloping a real decentralized search engine is not a piece of cake, because it requires consensus.\nFor example, YaCy, probably discontinued, that implies a decentralized search engine without consensus, i.e. blockchain, can't be sustainable.\n\n\nMost ZN SE projects tend to be given up, which means such thing is a single point of failure and heavily relies on the maintainment of the author",
