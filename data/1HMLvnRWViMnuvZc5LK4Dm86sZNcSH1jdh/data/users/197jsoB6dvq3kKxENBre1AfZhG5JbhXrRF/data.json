			"title": "Special Questions by Amateurs on PHP",
			"body": "Recently I'm engaged on special work to help some Christians, by using the decentralized web. \n\nSince I’m myself an amateur only, without very good mastering of PHP language,  \nI’ve got a few special questions here, related to the webpage style management. \nFor example, on the below site, \nhttp://127.0.0.1:43110/1B4vYHwkCywhjs3GMxFSvdCraYj5dh9LTV/ \nthere’s a plan to add a few lines of content at the bottom part of the page (called \"footer” or not? )\n\nAdjustment work has been done on the files of all.css, besides the other file index.html. \n\nSome problems are encountered on the newly added section, which includes the special bold line of text in the middle part, \n**the ShadowGate • A Hot Topic at the Sensitive Season — An Unprecedented Exposure！**\n\nThis newly added section is planned to appear at the bottom center position of the page, instead of the left position. \nRight now, I don’t know how to do the further adjustment, so as to move the position from left to center. \n\nMaybe some special adjustments are needed on the file of all.css, or a simple adjustment on the index.html can get it done? \n\nThere’re some excellent masters here. Please give some advice when at your convenience. Many Thanks.",
