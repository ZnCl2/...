			"body": "Hi!\n\nBalancer73, the owner of several ZeroNet forums, died 1.5 years ago. Here in ZeroNet, his forums keep running without any support, hosting and maintenance, as intended according to the network design. But some maintenance is desirable sometimes.\n\nI have access to the private keys of some sites of him, so I'm able to manage those. So if you have any problems, bugs or suggestions for improving the sites, feel free to contact me.\n\nCurrently, I raised the limits on the following sites:\n\n* [Unlimit Talk](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1HMLvnRWViMnuvZc5LK4Dm86sZNcSH1jdh/): 2000k -> 3000k\n* [DIY Talk](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1diyHbGrjKR65DLVpaLoMYsiwqiQYskKD/): 200k -> 500k\n* [Music Talk](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1HidBY8MhvfnGJNPcuh47TCfbK25VvdzzY/): 200k -> 500k\n* [ZeroNet Ideas Talk](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1ideasVz3NzYp24L2tzkt6Prp81xqmTJv/): 200k -> 500k\n\nI'll also update the forum engine later and add some more cross-forum navigation. Not sure if it is the near future, since I have not much free time.\n\nPlease also report any troubles related to incompatibilities between the forum engine and the current or upcoming ZeroNet releases. I'll try to fix those first.",
