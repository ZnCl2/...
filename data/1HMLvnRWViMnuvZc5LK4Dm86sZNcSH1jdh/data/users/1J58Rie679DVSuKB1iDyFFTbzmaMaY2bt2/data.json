However, many renderers -- like Github's and Markdown Here -- support syntax highlighting. Which languages are supported and how those language names should be written will vary from renderer to renderer. Markdown Here supports highlighting for dozens of languages (and not-really-languages, like diffs and HTTP headers); to see the complete list, and how to write the language names, see the highlight.js demo page.\n```\nInline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.\n```\nInline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.\n\nBlocks of code are either fenced by lines with three back-ticks ```, or are indented with four spaces. I recommend only using the fenced code blocks -- they're easier and only they support syntax highlighting.\n```\n```javascript\nvar s = \"JavaScript syntax highlighting\";\nalert(s);\n```\n \n```python\ns = \"Python syntax highlighting\"\nprint s\n```\n \n```\nNo language indicated, so no syntax highlighting. \nBut let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.\n```\n```\n```javascript\nvar s = \"JavaScript syntax highlighting\";\nalert(s);\n```\n \n```python\ns = \"Python syntax highlighting\"\nprint s\n```\n \n```\nNo language indicated, so no syntax highlighting. \nBut let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.\n```\n\n# Tables\nTables aren't part of the core Markdown spec, but they are part of GFM and Markdown Here supports them. They are an easy way of adding tables to your email -- a task that would otherwise require copy-pasting from another application.\n```\nColons can be used to align columns.\n\n| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |\n| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|\n| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |\n| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |\n| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |\n\nThere must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.\nThe outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the \nraw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.\n\nMarkdown | Less | Pretty\n--- | --- | ---\n*Still* | `renders` | **nicely**\n1 | 2 | 3\n```\nColons can be used to align columns.\n\n| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |\n| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|\n| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |\n| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |\n| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |\n\nThere must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.\nThe outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the \nraw Markdown line up prettily.

You'll soon learn to get what you want. \"Markdown Toggle\" is your friend.\n\nHere are some things to try out:\n```\nHere's a line for us to start with.\n\nThis line is separated from the one above by two newlines, so it will be a *separate paragraph*.\n\nThis line is also a separate paragraph, but...\nThis line is only separated by a single newline, so it's a separate line in the *same paragraph*.\n```\nHere's a line for us to start with.\n\nThis line is separated from the one above by two newlines, so it will be a *separate paragraph*.\n\nThis line is also a separate paragraph, but...\nThis line is only separated by a single newline, so it's a separate line in the *same paragraph*.\n\n\n# External links\n* [Markdown Guide](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#headers)\n* [official website](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)\n* [wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)",

			"title": "How to deplay Zeronet with TOR on a private VPS",
			"body": "Here is what I did for my headless Ubuntu 19.04 server.\n\n# Install TOR to enable functionality with zeronet.  [Source](https://www.linuxuprising.com/2018/10/how-to-install-and-use-tor-as-proxy-in.html)\n\n - Start by installing apt-transport-https, needed in order to use https repositories, and curl, to download the repository key:\n\n`sudo apt install apt-transport-https curl`\n\n - And then add the Tor repository (and its key) in Ubuntu using these commands:\n\n`sudo -i`\n\n`echo \"deb https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org/ $(lsb_release -cs) main\" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/tor.list`\n\n`curl https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org/A3C4F0F979CAA22CDBA8F512EE8CBC9E886DDD89.asc | gpg --import`\n\n`gpg --export A3C4F0F979CAA22CDBA8F512EE8CBC9E886DDD89 | apt-key add -`\n\n`apt update`\n\n`exit`\n\nFor Linux Mint, replace `$(lsb_release -cs)` in the first command with the Ubuntu version codename your Linux Mint version is based on. For Linux Mint 19 (and 19.x), use bionic, while for Linux Mint 18.x use xenial.\n\n - Now you can install Tor, tor-geoipdb (to be able to use country specific exit nodes), torsocks (a library to easily torify applications) and deb.torproject.org-keyring (a package that makes sure you have the latest repository signing key):\n\n`sudo apt install tor tor-geoipdb torsocks deb.torproject.org-keyring`\n\n# Prepare TOR to work with Zeronet,  [Source](https://zeronet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq/#how-to-use-zeronet-with-tor)\n\n - Open up your /etc/tor/torrc file with\n\n`sudo nano /etc/tor/torrc`\n\n - Remove the # character from lines `ControlPort 9051` and `CookieAuthentication 1` (line ~57)\n    \n - Restart tor, then add permission for yourself to read the auth cookie. With Debian Linux, \n\n`sudo usermod -a -G debian-tor [yourlinuxuser]`\n\n(be sure to replace [yourlinuxuser] appropratly)\n - Logout/Login with your user to apply group changes\n\nTip: You can verify if your Tor setup is running correctly using\n`echo 'PROTOCOLINFO' | nc 127.0.0.1 9051`\n\n# Install Zeronet for Debian Linux,  [Source](https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/tree/py3#other-platforms-install-from-source)\n\n`sudo apt-get update`\n`wget https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet-linux/archive/dist-linux64/ZeroNet-py3-linux64.tar.gz`\n`tar xvpfz ZeroNet-py3-linux64.tar.gz`\n\t\n# Enable the Bootstrapper and UIPassword plugins and launch Zeronet\n\n`cd ZeroNet-linux-dist-linux64/`\n\n`cd core`\n\n`cd plugins`\n\n`mv disabled-UiPassword UiPassword`\n\n`mv disabled-Bootstrapper Bootstrapper`\n\n`cd ..`\n\n`cd ..`\n\n`nohup ./ZeroNet.sh --ui_ip '*' --ui_port 80 --ui_password mypassword`\n\n - Now you can close your terminal and open your browser to the ip address of your server to see the WebUI.\n\nNotes: \n(ui_ip tells the client to bind the UI to any ip)\n(ui_port) being set to 80 is the default port for your browser, you can change it but then you will need to specify the port with the addres such as `http://ServerIP:43110` with 43110 being the identified port for the WebUI\n(ui_password) this is the password used for your WebUI\n\n## Happy ZeroBoxing!",
