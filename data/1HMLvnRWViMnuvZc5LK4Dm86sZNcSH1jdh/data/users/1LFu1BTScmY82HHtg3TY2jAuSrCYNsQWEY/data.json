That, I believe, will give us the best set of requirements for comparing GitHub, GitLab, improving Git Center and any other possible SCM solution. This is why'd I'd prefer to discuss how to decentralize the development process before leaving GitHub. \n\nYes, I also think so. It would be good to compare all possible solutions and chose the best before just switching to first one.\n\nAlso, given that Git Center would be improved in the (hopefully near) future, it could be the best to just wait until it is ready and then switch to it. It would also be good to also take some of the best features from other solutions to Git Center and maybe also support and use other decentralized protocols such as IPFS.",
