Killed by the FSB or was he an alias,  a made-up character that the FSB self operated and as the propaganda project ended, the made up character had to \"die\"? I'm not saying that the possibility that he was a sincere dissident does not exist. I really do not know, what he was, but he sure was clever.\n\nI've stumbled upon quite a few of what seems like his blogs here on ZN. From what little impression I have of the account, Balancer was a real person with diverse interests and some interesting thoughts. It's only now I connected those unmaintained blogs I found and this message. I could be wrong.\n\nIt's sad if he's gone, it's sad if any person dies and theres somebody left to miss what the person could offer. For me it's more blog content. For what is presented as his wife and daughter on the blogs, it's probably a lot of other things.\n\nBut his thoughts will stay here on ZeroNet, available to everyone until the last person who's hosting the blogs deletes or loses them, probably long after all his earthly remains are gone - possibly available for everyone, forever.",
