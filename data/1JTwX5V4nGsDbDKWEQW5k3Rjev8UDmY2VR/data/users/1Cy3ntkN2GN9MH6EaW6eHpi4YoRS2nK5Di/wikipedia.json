Despite the name, administrators are not supposed to enjoy any special privilege in decision-making; instead, their powers are mostly limited to making edits that have project-wide effects and thus are disallowed to ordinary editors, and to implement restrictions intended to prevent certain persons from making disruptive edits (such as vandalism).<ref>{{cite web |url = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators#Administrator_conduct |title = Wikipedia:Administrators |accessdate = July 12, 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:RfA_Review/Reflect |title = Wikipedia:RfA_Review/Reflect |accessdate = September 24, 2009 }}</ref>\n\nFewer editors become administrators than in years past, in part because the process of vetting potential Wikipedia administrators has become more rigorous.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/07/3-charts-that-show-how-wikipedia-is-running-out-of-admins/259829 |title = 3 Charts That Show How Wikipedia Is Running Out of Admins |last = Meyer |first = Robinson |work = [[The Atlantic]] |date = July 16, 2012 |accessdate = September 2, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n''Bureaucrats'' name new administrators, solely upon the recommendations from the community.\n\n=== Dispute resolution ===\n\nWikipedians often have disputes regarding content, which may result in repeatedly making opposite changes to an article, known as [[WP:EW|edit warring]].<ref>{{srlink|Wikipedia:Dispute Resolution|Dispute Resolution}}</ref><ref name=\"NBC WP editorial warzone 1\" /> Over time, Wikipedia has developed a semi-formal dispute resolution process to assist in such circumstances. In order to determine community consensus, editors can raise issues at appropriate community forums,<ref group=notes>See for example the [[Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons/Noticeboard|Biographies of Living Persons Noticeboard]] or [[Wikipedia:Neutral point of view/Noticeboard|Neutral Point of View Noticeboard]], created to address content falling under their respective areas.</ref> or seek outside input through [[Wikipedia:Third opinion|third opinion requests]] or by initiating a more general community discussion known as a [[WP:RfC|request for comment]].\n\n==== Arbitration Committee ====\n{{Main article|Arbitration Committee}}\n\nThe Arbitration Committee presides over the ultimate dispute resolution process. Although disputes usually arise from a disagreement between two opposing views on how an article should read, the Arbitration Committee explicitly refuses to directly rule on the specific view that should be adopted. Statistical analyses suggest that the committee ignores the content of disputes and rather focuses on the way disputes are conducted,<ref name=\"emory disputes handled 1\" /> functioning not so much to resolve disputes and make peace between conflicting editors, but to weed out problematic editors while allowing potentially productive editors back in to participate. Therefore, the committee does not dictate the <!-- The committee may (directly) rule that a content change is inappropriate, but may NOT (directly) rule that a certain content is inappropriate. -->content of articles, although it sometimes condemns content changes when it deems the new content violates Wikipedia policies (for example, if the new content is considered [[Wikipedia:Neutral point of view|biased]]). Its remedies<!-- Although a caution is no remedy, this is the language used in the reference. This could be quoted or changed. --> include cautions and [[WP:Probation|probations]] (used in 63% of cases) and [[WP:BAN|banning editors from articles]] (43%), subject matters (23%), or Wikipedia (16%). Complete bans from Wikipedia are generally limited to instances of impersonation and [[anti-social behavior]]. When conduct is not impersonation or anti-social, but rather anti-consensus<!-- This needs to be clarified. Anti-consensus behavior appears to be defined mostly as \"edit warring\". --> or in violation of editing policies, remedies tend to be limited to warnings.<ref>{{cite journal |title = Wikitruth through Wikiorder |ssrn = 1354424 |publisher = [[Emory University School of Law]] |work = [[Emory Law Journal]] |format =  |volume = 59 |issue = 1 |year = 2009 |pages = 151–210 |author = David A.

[[Roy Rosenzweig]], a history professor, stated that ''American National Biography Online'' outperformed Wikipedia in terms of its \"clear and engaging prose\", which, he said, was an important aspect of good historical writing.<ref name=\"Rosenzweig\" /> Contrasting Wikipedia's treatment of [[Abraham Lincoln]] to that of [[American Civil War|Civil War]] historian [[James M. McPherson|James McPherson]] in ''American National Biography Online'', he said that both were essentially accurate and covered the major episodes in Lincoln's life, but praised \"McPherson's richer contextualization [...] his artful use of quotations to capture Lincoln's voice [...] and [...] his ability to convey a profound message in a handful of words.\" By contrast, he gives an example of Wikipedia's prose that he finds \"both verbose and dull\". Rosenzweig also criticized the \"waffling—encouraged by the NPOV policy—[which] means that it is hard to discern any overall interpretive stance in Wikipedia history\". By example, he quoted the conclusion of Wikipedia's article on [[William Clarke Quantrill]]. While generally praising the article, he pointed out its \"waffling\" conclusion: \"Some historians [...] remember him as an opportunistic, bloodthirsty outlaw, while others continue to view him as a daring soldier and local folk hero.\"<ref name=\"Rosenzweig\" />\n\nOther critics have made similar charges that, even if Wikipedia articles are factually accurate, they are often written in a poor, almost unreadable style.

Yasseri contended that simple reverts or \"undo\" operations were not the most significant measure of counterproductive behavior at Wikipedia and relied instead on the [[statistical measurement]] of detecting \"reverting/reverted pairs\" or \"mutually reverting edit pairs\". Such a \"mutually reverting edit pair\" is defined where one editor reverts the edit of another editor who then, in sequence, returns to revert the first editor in the \"mutually reverting edit pairs\". The results were tabulated for several language versions of Wikipedia. The English Wikipedia's three largest conflict rates belonged to the articles ''[[George W. Bush]]'', ''[[Anarchism]]'' and ''[[Muhammad]]''.<ref name=\"autogenerated3\" /> By comparison, for the German Wikipedia, the three largest conflict rates at the time of the [[Oxford]] study were for the articles covering (i) ''[[Croatia]]'', (ii) ''[[Scientology]]'' and (iii) ''[[9/11 conspiracy theories]]''.<ref name=\"autogenerated3\"/>\n\nResearchers from the [[Washington University]] developed a statistical model to measure systematic bias in the behavior of Wikipedia's users regarding controversial topics.

This made it a poor choice for a general reference work: for example, the GFDL requires the reprints of materials from Wikipedia to come with a full copy of the GFDL text. In December 2002, the [[Creative Commons license]] was released: it was specifically designed for creative works in general, not just for software manuals. The license gained popularity among bloggers and others distributing creative works on the Web. The Wikipedia project sought the switch to the Creative Commons.<ref name=\"WPF switch to CC\">{{cite web |url = https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Resolution:License_update |title = Resolution:License update |year = 2007 |author = Walter Vermeir |publisher = Wikizine |accessdate = December 4, 2007 }}</ref> Because the two licenses, GFDL and Creative Commons, were incompatible, in November 2008, following the request of the project, the [[Free Software Foundation]] (FSF) released a new version of the GFDL designed specifically to allow Wikipedia to {{srlink|Wikipedia:Licensing update|relicense its content to CC BY-SA}} by August 1, 2009.

Some language editions, such as the English Wikipedia, include non-free image files under [[fair use]] doctrine, while the others have opted not to, in part because of the lack of fair use doctrines in their home countries (e.g. in [[Copyright law of Japan|Japanese copyright law]]). Media files covered by [[free content]] licenses (e.g. [[Creative Commons]]' CC BY-SA) are shared across language editions via [[Wikimedia Commons]] repository, a project operated by the Wikimedia Foundation.

And the shift to mobile editing has lagged even more.\"<ref name=\"small screen\" /> ''The New York Times'' reports that Möller has assigned \"a team of 10 software developers focused on mobile\", out of a total of approximately 200 employees working at the Wikimedia Foundation.

The first of these was the 1986 [[BBC Domesday Project]], which included text (entered on [[BBC Micro]] computers) and photographs from over 1&nbsp;million contributors in the UK, and covered the geography, art, and culture of the UK. This was the first interactive multimedia encyclopedia (and was also the first major multimedia document connected through internal links), with the majority of articles being accessible through an interactive map of the UK. The user interface and part of the content of the Domesday Project were emulated on a website until 2008.<ref name=\"Domesday Project\" />\n\nSeveral free-content, collaborative encyclopedias were created around the same period as Wikipedia (e.g. [[Everything2]]),<ref>{{cite news |url = http://www.cnn.com/2000/TECH/computing/11/21/net.gen.encyclopedias.idg/index.html |title = The next generation of online encyclopedias |last = Frauenfelder |first = Mark |website = CNN.com |publication-date = November 21, 2000 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20040814034109/http://www.cnn.com/2000/TECH/computing/11/21/net.gen.encyclopedias.idg/index.html |archive-date = August 14, 2004 |dead-url = yes }}</ref> with many later being merged into the project (e.g. [[GNE (encyclopedia)|GNE]]).<ref name=\"gnu.org\">[https://www.gnu.org/encyclopedia/encyclopedia.html The Free Encyclopedia Project] gnu.org ( {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/64QXgZhy2?url=http://www.gnu.org/encyclopedia/encyclopedia.html |date=January 3, 2012 }})</ref> One of the most successful early online encyclopedias incorporating entries by the public was [[h2g2]], which was created by [[Douglas Adams]] in 1999. The h2g2 encyclopedia is relatively light-hearted, focusing on articles which are both witty and informative.\n\nSubsequent collaborative [[knowledge base|knowledge]] websites have drawn inspiration from Wikipedia. Some, such as [[Susning.nu]], [[Enciclopedia Libre Universal en Español|Enciclopedia Libre]], [[Hudong]], and [[Baidu Baike]] likewise employ no formal review process, although some like [[Conservapedia]] are not as open. Others use more traditional [[peer review]], such as [[Encyclopedia of Life]] and the online wiki encyclopedias ''[[Scholarpedia]]'' and [[Citizendium]].
