It is supported on [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Unix-like]] systems, such as [[FreeBSD]], [[macOS]] and [[Linux]]. \n\nMercurial's major design goals include high performance and scalability, decentralized, fully distributed collaborative development, robust handling of both [[plain text]] and [[binary file]]s, and advanced branching and merging capabilities, while remaining conceptually simple.<ref>{{Citation | contribution-url = https://www.mercurial-scm.org/wiki/Presentations?action=AttachFile&do=get&target=ols-mercurial-paper.pdf | first = Matthew ‘Matt’ | last = Mackall | contribution = Towards a Better SCM: Revlog and Mercurial | place = Ottawa | format = [[Portable document format|PDF]] | title = Linux Symposium Proceedings | year = 2006 | publisher = Mercurial-scm.org}}.</ref> It includes an integrated web-interface.  Mercurial has also taken steps to ease the transition for users of other version control systems, particularly [[Apache Subversion|Subversion]].  Mercurial is primarily a [[Command line interface|command-line]] driven program, but [[graphical user interface]] extensions are available, e.g. [[TortoiseHg]], and several [[integrated development environment|IDEs]] offer support for version control with Mercurial. All of Mercurial's operations are invoked as arguments to its driver program <code>hg</code> (a reference to Hg - the [[chemical symbol]] of the element [[Mercury (element)|mercury]]).\n\nMatt Mackall originated Mercurial and serves as its lead developer. Mercurial is released as [[free software]] under the terms of the [[GNU General Public License#Version 2|GNU GPL v2]] (or any later version<ref>\n{{Citation\n| publisher = Mercurial-scm.org\n| contribution-url = https://www.mercurial-scm.org/wiki/Relicensing\n| contribution = Relicensing | title = Mercurial | type = wiki\n}}.\n</ref>). It is mainly implemented using the [[Python (programming language)|Python programming language]], but includes a binary [[diff]] implementation written in [[C (programming language)|C]].  \n\n== History ==\nMackall first announced Mercurial on 19 April 2005.<ref name=announced>{{cite mailing list\n| last = Mackall\n| first = Matt\n| date = 2005-04-20\n| title = Mercurial v0.1 – a minimal scalable distributed SCM\n| url = https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/4/20/45\n| mailinglist = [[Linux kernel mailing list|Linux kernel]]\n}}</ref>  The impetus for this was the announcement earlier that month by [[Bitmover]] that they were withdrawing the free version of [[BitKeeper]].\n\nBitKeeper had been used for the [[version control]] requirements of the [[Linux kernel]] project. Mackall decided to write a distributed version control system as a replacement for use with the Linux kernel. This project started a few days after the now well-known [[Git (software)|Git]] project was initiated by [[Linus Torvalds]] with similar aims.<ref>{{cite mailing list|url=http://lkml.indiana.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0504.3/1404.html|title=Re: Mercurial 0.4b vs git patchbomb benchmark|date=2005-04-29|mailinglist=[[Linux kernel mailing list|Linux kernel]]|last=Mackall|first=Matt|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120709203437/http://lkml.indiana.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0504.3/1404.html|archivedate=9 July 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe Linux kernel project decided to use [[Git (software)|Git]] rather than Mercurial, but Mercurial is now used by many other projects (see [[#Open_source_projects_using_Mercurial|below]]). \"Git vs. Mercurial\" has become one of the holy wars of [[hacker culture]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/aix/library/au-mercurial/|title=Managing source code with Mercurial|quote=Mercurial and Git fans are also happy to discuss the learning curve, merits, and usability of each VCS system's command set. Space prevents that discussion here, but a web search on that topic will provide lots of interesting reading material.}}</ref>\n\nIn an answer on the Mercurial mailing list, Matt Mackall explained how the name \"Mercurial\" was chosen:\n\n{{Quotation|Shortly before the first release, I read an article about the ongoing Bitkeeper debacle that described [[Larry McVoy]] as mercurial (in the sense of 'fickle'). Given the multiple meanings, the convenient abbreviation, and the good fit with my pre-existing naming scheme (see my email address), it clicked instantly. Mercurial is thus named in Larry's honor. I do not know if the same is true of Git.<ref>{{cite mailing list\n| last = Mackall\n| first = Matt\n| title = Why did Matt choose the name Mercurial?\n| url = https://www.mercurial-scm.org/pipermail/mercurial/2012-February/041807.html\n| mailinglist = Mercurial\n| date = 2012-02-15\n| accessdate = 7 June 2016\n}}</ref><ref>Torvalds has said: ''\"I'm an egotistical bastard, so I name all my projects after myself. First Linux, now git.\"''</ref>|}}\n\nIn 2013, Facebook adopted Mercurial and began work on scaling it to handle their large, unified code repository.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Goode|first1=Durham|last2=Agarwal|first2=Siddharth|title=Scaling Mercurial at Facebook|url=https://code.facebook.com/posts/218678814984400/scaling-mercurial-at-facebook/|website=Facebook Code|publisher=Facebook|accessdate=13 October 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Design ==\nMercurial uses [[SHA-1]] hashes to identify revisions. For repository access via a network, Mercurial uses an [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]]-based protocol that seeks to reduce round-trip requests, new connections and data transferred.  Mercurial can also work over [[Secure Shell|SSH]] where the protocol is very similar to the HTTP-based protocol. By default it uses a [[3-way merge]] before calling external merge tools.\n\n== Usage ==\nFigure 1 shows some of the most important operations in Mercurial and their relations to Mercurial's concepts.\n[[File:Mercurial commandd and their relations.png|thumb|Figure 1: Some important operations of Mercurial and their relations.]]\n\n== Adoption ==\nAlthough Mercurial was not selected to manage the Linux kernel sources, it has been adopted by several organizations, including [[Facebook]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://code.facebook.com/posts/218678814984400/scaling-mercurial-at-facebook/|title=Scaling Mercurial at Facebook}}</ref> the [[World Wide Web Consortium|W3C]], and [[Mozilla]].
