The issuing rate forms a [[geometric series]], and the rate halves every 210,000 blocks, roughly every four years, reaching a final total of 21 million NMC.\n\nNamecoins are currently traded primarily for USD and other cryptocurrencies, mostly on online [[Digital currency exchanger|exchanges]]. To avoid the danger of [[chargebacks]], reversible transactions, such as those with [[credit cards]] or PayPal, are not advised since Namecoin transactions are irreversible.\n\n=== Addresses ===\nPayments and records in the Namecoin network are made to ''addresses'', which are [[Base58]]-encoded hashes of users' [[public key]]s. They are strings of 33 numbers and letters which begin with the letter ''N'' or ''M''. Initially addresses beginning with ''1'' existed but this was changed to avoid confusion with [[Bitcoin]] addresses. <!-- do NOT put any example addresses here -->\n\n=== Records ===\nEach Namecoin record consists of a key and a value which can be up to 520 [[byte]]s in size.  Each key is actually a path, with the namespace preceding the name of the record.  The key <code>d/example</code> signifies a record stored in the [[DNS]] namespace <code>d</code> with the name <code>example</code> and corresponds to the record for the <code>example.bit</code> website.  The content of <code>d/example</code> is expected to conform to the DNS namespace specification.<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://wiki.namecoin.info/index.php?title=Domain_Name_Specification|title = Namecoin DNS specification|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref>\n\nThe current fee for a record is 0.01 NMC and records expire after 36000 blocks (~200 days) unless updated or renewed. Namecoins used to purchase records are marked as used and destroyed, as giving the fee to miners would enable larger miners to register names at a significant discount.<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://wiki.namecoin.info/index.php?title=FAQ|title = Namecoin FAQ|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref>\n\n== Uses ==\nProposed potential uses for Namecoin besides domain name registration include:\n* [[Identity system]]s<ref>{{cite web | url=https://wiki.namecoin.org/index.php?title=Identity | title=Namespace:Identity | publisher=Dot-Bit }}</ref>\n* [[Messaging system]]s<ref>{{cite web | url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141012101628/http://dot-bit.org/Messaging_System | title=<nowiki>Messaging System]</nowiki> | publisher=Dot-Bit }}</ref><ref>[http://testnet.explorer.namecoin.info/n/1877%7C Namecoin block explorer], [https://web.archive.org/web/20111023075518/http://testnet.explorer.dot-bit.org/n/1877%7C Archived here]</ref>\n* Personal [[namespace]]s<ref>{{cite web | url=https://wiki.namecoin.org/index.php?title=Identity | title=Personal Namespace | publisher=Dot-Bit }}</ref>\n* [[Notary]]/[[timestamp]] systems<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.techworld.com/security/3449015/could-the-bitcoin-network-be-used-as-an-ultrasecure-notary-service/ | title=Could the Bitcoin network be used as an ultrasecure notary service? | work=Techworld | first=Jeremy | last=Kirk | date=2013-05-24 }}</ref>\n* [[Pseudonym|Alias]] systems<ref>[http://ecdsa.org/bitcoin-alias/ ecdsa.org/bitcoin-alias/], [https://web.archive.org/web/20120531230204/http://ecdsa.org/bitcoin-alias/ Archived page]</ref><ref>[http://ecdsa.org/bitcoin_URIs.html ecdsa.org/bitcoin_URIs.html], [https://web.archive.org/web/20120704170347/http://ecdsa.org/bitcoin_URIs.html Archived page]</ref>\n* Issuance of [[Share (finance)|shares]]/stocks<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://forum.namecoin.info/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=567&p=6793&hilit=stocks#p6793|title = Coming up: Namecoin Stock Control|date = |accessdate = 2012-10-05|website = Namecoin forum|publisher = |last = Phelix|first = }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url = https://forum.namecoin.info/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=1857&hilit=stocks|title = ANTPY – Atomic Name Trading|date = 2014-01-12|accessdate = |website = Namecoin Forum|publisher = |last = Phelix|first = }}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nIn September 2010 a discussion was started in the Bitcointalk forum about a hypothetical system called BitDNS and generalizing bitcoin, based on a talk at IRC at 14 November 2010.
