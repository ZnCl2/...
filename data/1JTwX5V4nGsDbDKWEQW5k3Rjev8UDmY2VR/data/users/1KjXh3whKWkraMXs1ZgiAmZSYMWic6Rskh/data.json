In contrast to cytoplasmic [[organelle]]s, CBs lack any phospholipid membrane which would separate their content, largely consisting of proteins and RNA, from the surrounding [[nucleoplasm]]. They were first reported by [[Santiago Ramón y Cajal]] in 1903, who called them ''nucleolar accessory bodies'' due to their association with the [[Nucleolus|nucleoli]] in neuronal cells.<ref name=Cajal_1903>{{cite journal |author=Cajal SR |title=Un sencillo metodo de coloracion selectiva del reticulo protoplasmico y sus efectos en los diversos organos nerviosos de vertebrados e invertebrados |journal=Trab Lab Investig Biol Univ Madr |volume=2 |issue= |pages=129–221 |year=1903 |pmid= |doi=}}</ref> They were rediscovered with the use of the [[electron microscope]] (EM) and named ''coiled bodies'', according to their appearance as coiled threads on EM images, and later renamed after their discoverer.<ref name=\"Gall\">{{cite journal|last1=Gall|first1=JG|last2=Bellini|first2=M|last3=Wu|first3=Z|last4=Murphy|first4=C|title=Assembly of the nuclear transcription and processing machinery: Cajal bodies (coiled bodies) and transcriptosomes.|journal=Molecular Biology of the Cell|date=December 1999|volume=10|issue=12|pages=4385–402|pmid=10588665|doi=10.1091/mbc.10.12.4385|pmc=25765}}</ref> Research on CBs was accelerated after discovery and [[Molecular cloning|cloning]] of the marker protein [[Coilin|p80/Coilin]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Andrade LE, Chan EK, Raska I, Peebles CL, Roos G, Tan EM |title=Human autoantibody to a novel protein of the nuclear coiled body: immunological characterization and cDNA cloning of p80-coilin |journal=J.

Because of their close association with nucleoli he named them ''nucleolar accessory bodies''. Later on, they were forgotten and rediscovered multiple times independently which led to a state where scientists from different research fields used different names for the same structure. Names used for CBs included \"sphere organelles\", \"Binnenkörper\", \"nucleolar bodies\" or \"coiled bodies\". The name coiled bodies comes from observation of electron microscopists Monneron and Bernhard. They described  bodies as aggregates composed of coiled threads with thickness of 400-600 [[Ångström|Å]]. When using higher magnification, they appear as tiny, 50 Å thick fibrils irregularly twisted along the axis of the threads. The bodies were even predicted to consist of [[ribonucleoproteins]] since treatment of cells with [[protease]] and [[RNase]] together, but not alone, caused dramatic changes to the structure of CBs.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Monneron A, Bernhard W |title=Fine structural organization of the interphase nucleus in some mammalian cells |journal=J.

Cajal bodies are associated with telomerase assembly and recruitment via a CAB-RNA sequence common in both CB RNAs (scaRNAs) and the RNA component of telomerase (TERC). TCAB1 recognizes the CAB sequence in both and recruits telomerase to the CBs.\n\nCBs contain high concentrations of [[RNA splicing|splicing]] small nuclear ribonucleoproteins ([[snRNP]]s), possibly indicating that they function to modify RNA after it has been [[Translation (biology)|transcribed]] from DNA.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Nizami Z, Deryusheva S, Gall JG | title=The Cajal body and histone locus body | journal=COLD SPRING HARBOR PERSPECTIVES IN BIOLOGY | volume=2 | issue=7 | year=2010 | pages=a000653 | url = http://cshperspectives.cshlp.org/content/2/7/a000653.long | pmc = 2890199 | doi = 10.1101/cshperspect.a000653 | id= | pmid=20504965}}</ref> Experimental evidence indicates that CBs contribute to the [[biogenesis]] of [[telomerase]] enzyme, and assist in subsequent transport of telomerase to [[telomere]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Jády BE, Richard P, Bertrand E, Kiss T | title=Cell cycle-dependent recruitment of telomerase RNA and Cajal bodies to human telomeres | journal=[[Molecular Biology of the Cell]] | volume=17 | issue=2 | year=2006 | pages=944–954 | url = http://www.molbiolcell.org/content/17/2/944.long | pmc = 1356602 | id= | pmid=16319170 | doi=10.1091/mbc.E05-09-0904}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Tomlinson RL, Ziegler TD, Supakorndej T, Terns RM, Terns MP | title=Cell cycle-regulated trafficking of human telomerase to telomeres | journal=[[Molecular Biology of the Cell]] | volume=17 | issue=2 | year=2006 | pages=955–965 | url = http://www.molbiolcell.org/content/17/2/955.long | pmc = 1356603 | id= | pmid=16339074 | doi=10.1091/mbc.E05-09-0903}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n\n<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------\nSee http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Footnotes for a\ndiscussion of different citation methods and how to generate\nfootnotes using the <ref> & </ref> tags and the {{Reflist}} template\n-------------------------------------------------------------------- -->\n\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n{{Nucleus}}\n\n[[Category:Organelles]]\n[[Category:Nuclear substructures|S]]\n[[Category:Cell nucleus]]\n[[Category:Cell anatomy]]\n[[Category:Telomeres]]",
