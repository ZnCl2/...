In support of the essentialist view is the finding that conversion therapy (attempts to change sexual orientation) is rarely successful. In Maccio's (2011) review of sexual reorientation therapy attempts, she lists two studies that claim to have successfully converted gay men and lesbians to heterosexuals and four that demonstrate the contrary. She sought to settle the debate using a sample that was not recruited from religious organizations. The study consisted of 37 former conversion therapy participants (62.2% were male) from various cultural and religious backgrounds who currently or previously identified as lesbian, gay, or bisexual. The results indicated that there were no statistically significant shifts in sexual orientation from pre- to post-treatment. In follow-up sessions, the few changes in sexual orientation that did occur following therapy did not last. This study stands as support for the essentialist view of sexual orientation, but the largely male sample population confounds the findings.<ref>Maccio, E.M. (2011). Self-reported sexual orientation and identity before and after sexual reorientation therapy. Journal of Gay and Lesbian Mental Health, 15. 242-259.</ref>\n\nFurther support for the essentialist view of sexual orientation is that [[gender atypical behavior]] in childhood (i.e., a young boy playing with dolls) appears to predict homosexuality in adulthood (see [[childhood gender nonconformity]]). A longitudinal study by Drummond et al. (2008) looked at young girls with [[gender dysphoria]] (a significant example of gender atypical behavior) and found that the majority of these girls grew up to identity as bisexual or lesbian.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Drummond | first1 = K.D. | last2 = Bradley | first2 = S.J. | last3 = Peterson-Badali | first3 = M. | last4 = Zucker | first4 = K.J. | year = 2008 | title = A follow-up study of girls with gender identity disorder | url = | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 44 | issue = 1| pages = 34–45 | doi=10.1037/0012-1649.44.1.34}}</ref> Many retrospective studies looking at childhood behavior are criticized for potential memory errors;<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Rieger | first1 = G. | last2 = Linsenmeier | first2 = J.A.W. | last3 = Gygax | first3 = L. | last4 = Bailey | first4 = J.M. | year = 2008 | title = Sexual orientation and childhood gender nonconformity: evidence from home videos | url = | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 44 | issue = 1| pages = 46–58 | doi=10.1037/0012-1649.44.1.46 | pmid=18194004}}</ref> so a study by Rieger, Linsenmeier, Gygax, & Bailey (2008) used home videos to investigate the relationship between childhood behaviors and adult sexual orientation.

This socialization is a plausible cause of greater female sexual fluidity.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Rust | first1 = P.C.R. | year = 2000 | title = Bisexuality: a contemporary paradox for women | url = | journal = Journal of Social Issues | volume = 56 | issue = 2| pages = 205–221 | doi=10.1111/0022-4537.00161}}</ref> Whether female sexuality is naturally more fluid and therefore changes from social factors or social factors cause female sexuality to be less stable is unknown.\n\n[[Evolution]]ary perspectives propose that bisexuality ensures women have secure and consistent resources for their offspring by promoting the attainment of mothering contributions from other females. According to this view, women are capable of forming romantic bonds with both sexes and sexual fluidity may be explained as a [[reproductive strategy]] that ensures the survival of offspring.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Kuhle | first1 = B.X. | last2 = Radtke | first2 = S. | year = 2013 | title = Born both ways: The alloparenting hypothesis for sexual fluidity in women | url = | journal = Evolutionary Psychology | volume = 11 | issue = 2| page = 147470491301100202 }}</ref>\n\nWhile most studies point to female sexuality as being quite fluid, an influential longitudinal study concluded that stability of sexual orientation was more common than change.<ref name=\"Savin-Williams, R.C. 2012\" /> Gender differences in the stability of sexual orientation may vary by subgroup and could possibly be related to individual differences more than gender-wide characteristics.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n====Youth (age 14–21)====\n\nThere has been some research done to investigate the fluidity of sexual orientation identity in youth. While these studies indicate that sexuality can be fluid in youth, there is less focus on gender differences and more on subgroup differences (i.e., lesbian, gay, heterosexual, etc.) in fluidity.\n\nOne study that did compare the stability of youth sexual orientation identity across genders found results opposite to most done with adult samples. The study compared [[non-heterosexual]] male and female sexual orientation over a year and concluded that female youth were more likely to report consistent sexual identities than males.<ref name=RSHB06>{{cite journal | last1 = Rosario | first1 = M. | last2 = Schrimshaw | first2 = E.W. | last3 = Hunter | first3 = J. | last4 = Braun | first4 = L. | year = 2006 | title = Sexual identity development among lesbian, gay and bisexual youth: consistency and change over time | url = | journal = The Journal of Sex Research | volume = 43 | issue = 1| pages = 46–58 | doi=10.1080/00224490609552298}}</ref> The study was conducted over a single year. More research over longer time periods is necessary to come to any conclusions comparing the stability of sexuality in female and male youth.\n\nYouth appears to be when most change in sexual orientation identity occurs for females. A 10-year study compared sexual orientation as measured at four times during the study. The most change was found between the first (taken at 18 years of age) and second (taken at 20 years of age) measurements which was the only time bracket that fell during adolescence.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nA population-based study conducted over 6 years found that nonheterosexual (gay/lesbian/bisexual) male and female participants were more likely to change sexual orientation identity than heterosexual participants.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Savin-Williams | first1 = R.C. | last2 = Ream | first2 = G.L. | year = 2007 | title = Prevalence and stability of sexual orientation components during adolescence and young adulthood | url = | journal = Archives of Sexual Behavior | volume = 36 | issue = 3| pages = 385–394 | doi=10.1007/s10508-006-9088-5 | pmid=17195103}}</ref> A yearlong study found that sexual identity was more stable for gay and lesbian youth participants when compared to bisexual participants.<ref name=RSHB06 /> These studies indicate that bisexual youth have the most fluid sexuality. Gay and lesbian youth have more consistent sexual orientation identity when compared to bisexual youth, but when compared to heterosexual youth their sexuality is more fluid.\n\nThe identity integration process that individuals go through during adolescence appears to be associated with changes in sexual identity; adolescents who score higher on identity integration measures are more consistent in their sexual orientation (8). Bisexual youths seem to take longer to form their sexual identities than do consistently homosexual or heterosexual identifying youths<ref name=RSHB06 /> so bisexuality may be seen as a transitional phase during adolescence.  Rosario et al. (2006) conclude that \"acceptance, commitment, and integration of a gay/lesbian identity is an ongoing developmental process that, for many youths, may extend through adolescence and beyond.\"<ref name=RSHB06 /> The fluidity of sexuality during adolescence may not reflect absolute changes in sexual orientation but rather a process of change. While results of studies interested in the stability of youth sexuality are interesting, they must not be compared to those looking at adult sexuality.\n\n===Transgender individuals===\nThere is little to no research to date on the stability of sexual orientation identity within the [[transgender]] community. They may be studied independently from those identifying with culturally conventional gender roles. Some transgender individuals do not consistently identify as one gender and some consider the conventional sexual orientation labels inadequate. Developments in research suggests that transgender individuals are likely to classify their sexual orientation in [[non-binary]] ways, using their past and present sexual experiences and feelings to represent their sexual orientation, as opposed to using those which are based on traditional sex or gender descriptions.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Kuper | first1 = L. E. | last2 = Nussbaum | first2 = R. | last3 = Mustanski | first3 = B. | year = 2012 | title = Exploring the Diversity of Gender and Sexual Orientation Identities in an Online Sample of Transgender Individuals | journal = Journal of Sex Research | volume = 49 | issue = 2–3| pages = 244–254 | doi=10.1080/00224499.2011.596954}}</ref>\n\n== Cultural debate ==\nThe exploration on sexual fluidity initiated by Lisa M. Diamond presented a cultural challenge to the [[LGBT community]]; this is because although researchers usually emphasize that changes in sexual orientation are unlikely, despite [[conversion therapy]] attempts, sexual identity can change over time. That sexual orientation is not always stable challenges the views of many within the LGBT community, who believe that sexual orientation is fixed and immutable. For example, the public and media attention following [[Ruby Rose]]'s debut on ''[[Orange Is the New Black]]'' largely concerned heterosexual women commenting on her physical appearance,<ref name=\"West\">{{Cite news|last=West|first=Amy|title =Orange Is The New Black: Meet Ruby Rose, the inmate everyone is going crazy for|date = 16 June 2015|accessdate=24 June 2015 |work=[[International Business Times]] |url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/orange-new-black-meet-ruby-rose-inmate-everyone-going-crazy-1506462}}</ref><ref name=\"Teitel\">{{Cite news|last=Teitel|first=Emma|title =Go ahead.

Diamond is a lesbian, and Ritch C. Savin-Williams is gay.<ref name=\"Exploring\"/> People with sexual fluidity or a change in their sexual orientation identity may [[Coming out|come out]]. This was the case with [[Chirlane McCray]], the wife of [[Bill de Blasio]], who spoke about entering into a marriage with a man 34 years after writing a 1979 essay about coming out as a lesbian. She stated that she \"is more than just a label\", and that she did not suddenly consider herself sexually attracted to men, but rather attracted to de Blasio.<ref>[http://www.essence.com/2013/05/09/politicians-wife-chirlane-mccray \"Chirlane McCray: From Gay Trailblazer to Politician's Wife\"], Linda Villarosa for \"Essence\", May 09, 2013</ref><ref>[http://www.nydailynews.com/news/election/de-blasio-wife-chirlane-mccray-talks-lesbian-article-1.1339398 \"Mayoral candidate Bill de Blasio’s wife Chirlane McCray, a former lesbian, opens up about falling in love with a man\"], Kristen E.
