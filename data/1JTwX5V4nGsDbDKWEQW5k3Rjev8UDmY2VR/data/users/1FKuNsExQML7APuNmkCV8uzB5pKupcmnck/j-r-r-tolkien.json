While a pupil there, Tolkien was one of the cadets from the school's [[Officers Training Corps]] who helped \"line the route\" for the 1910 [[coronation]] parade of King [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]].

H. Jessop at [[Cheltenham]]. He declared that he had never ceased to love her and asked her to marry him. Edith replied that she had already accepted the proposal of George Field, the brother of one of her closest schoolfriends. Edith said, however, that she had agreed to marry Field only because she felt \"on the shelf\" and had begun to doubt that Tolkien still cared for her. She explained that, because of Tolkien's letter, everything had changed.\n\nOn 8 January 1913, Tolkien travelled by train to Cheltenham and was met on the platform by Edith. The two took a walk into the countryside, sat under a railway viaduct, and talked. By the end of the day, Edith had agreed to accept Tolkien's proposal. She wrote to Field and returned her engagement ring. Field was \"dreadfully upset at first\", and the Field family was \"insulted and angry\".<ref>''Biography'', pp.&nbsp;67–69.</ref> Upon learning of Edith's new plans, Jessop wrote to her guardian, \"I have nothing to say against Tolkien, he is a cultured gentleman, but his prospects are poor in the extreme, and when he will be in a position to marry I cannot imagine. Had he adopted a profession it would have been different.\"<ref>''The Tolkien Family Album'', (1992), page 34.</ref>\n\nFollowing their engagement, Edith reluctantly announced that she was converting to Catholicism at Tolkien's insistence.  Jessop, \"like many others of his age and class ... strongly [[anti-Catholicism|anti-Catholic]]\", was infuriated, and he ordered Edith to find other lodgings.<ref>''Biography'', p.&nbsp;73.</ref>\n\nEdith Bratt and Ronald Tolkien were formally engaged at Birmingham in January 1913, and married at [[St. Mary Immaculate Roman Catholic Church, Warwick]], on 22 March 1916.<ref>''Biography'', p.&nbsp;86.</ref> In his 1941 letter to Michael, Tolkien expressed admiration for his wife's willingness to marry a man with no job, little money, and no prospects except the likelihood of being killed in the Great War.<ref name=\"Letters, No. 43\"/>\n\n===First World War===\nIn August 1914 the United Kingdom entered the [[First World War]]. Tolkien's relatives were shocked when he elected not to immediately volunteer for the [[British Army]]. In a 1941 letter to his son Michael, Tolkien recalled, \"In those days chaps joined up, or were scorned publicly. It was a nasty cleft to be in for a young man with too much imagination and little physical courage.\"<ref name=\"Letters, No. 43\"/>\n\nInstead, Tolkien, \"endured the obloquy\",<ref name=\"Letters, No. 43\"/> and entered a programme wherein he delayed enlistment until completing his degree. By the time he passed his Finals in July 1915, Tolkien recalled that the hints were \"becoming outspoken from relatives\".<ref name=\"Letters, No. 43\"/> He was then commissioned as a temporary [[second lieutenant]] in the [[Lancashire Fusiliers]] on 15 July 1915.<ref>''Biography'', pp.&nbsp;77–85.</ref><ref>{{London Gazette|issue=29232|page=6968|date=16 July 1915}}</ref> He trained with the 13th (Reserve) Battalion on [[Cannock Chase]], [[Staffordshire]], for eleven months. In a letter to Edith, Tolkien complained, \"Gentlemen are rare among the superiors, and even human beings rare indeed.\"<ref>''Tolkien and the Great War'', p.&nbsp;94.</ref> Following their wedding, Lieutenant and Mrs. Tolkien took up lodgings near the training camp.\n\nOn 2 June 1916, Tolkien received a telegram summoning him to [[Folkestone]] for posting to France. The Tolkiens spent the night before his departure in a room at the Plough & Harrow Hotel in [[Edgbaston]], Birmingham.\n\nHe later wrote, \"Junior officers were being killed off, a dozen a minute. Parting from my wife then&nbsp;... it was like a death.\"<ref>Quoted in John Garth, ''Tolkien and the Great War'', p.&nbsp;138.</ref>\n\n====France====\nOn 5 June 1916, Tolkien boarded a troop transport for an overnight voyage to [[Calais]]. Like other soldiers arriving for the first time, he was sent to the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]]'s (BEF) base depot at [[Étaples]]. On 7 June, he was informed that he had been assigned as a signals officer to the 11th (Service) Battalion, Lancashire Fusiliers. The battalion was part of the [[74th Brigade (United Kingdom)|74th Brigade]], [[25th Division (United Kingdom)|25th Division]].\n\nWhile waiting to be summoned to his unit, Tolkien sank into boredom. To pass the time, he composed a poem entitled ''The Lonely Isle'', which was inspired by his feelings during the sea crossing to Calais. To evade the British Army's [[postal censorship]], he also developed a code of dots by which Edith could track his movements.<ref>Garth, John. ''Tolkien and the Great War'', Boston, Houghton Mifflin 2003, pp.&nbsp;144–145.</ref>\n\nHe left Étaples on 27 June 1916 and joined his battalion at [[Rubempré]], near [[Amiens]].<ref>Garth (2003), pages 147–148.</ref> He found himself commanding enlisted men who were drawn mainly from the mining, milling, and weaving towns of Lancashire.<ref>Garth (2003), pp.&nbsp;148–149.</ref> According to John Garth, he \"felt an affinity for these working class men\", but military protocol forbade him from developing friendships with \"[[Other ranks (UK)|other ranks]]\". Instead, he was required to \"take charge of them, discipline them, train them, and probably censor their letters ... If possible, he was supposed to inspire their love and loyalty.\"<ref name=\"Garth149\">Garth (2003), p.&nbsp;149.</ref>\n\nTolkien later lamented, \"The most improper job of any man ... is bossing other men. Not one in a million is fit for it, and least of all those who seek the opportunity.\"<ref name=\"Garth149\"/>\n\n====Battle of the Somme====\nTolkien arrived at the [[Battle of the Somme|Somme]] in early July 1916. In between terms behind the lines at [[Bouzincourt]], he participated in the assaults on the [[Schwaben Redoubt]] and the [[Leipzig salient]]. Tolkien's time in combat was a terrible stress for Edith, who feared that every knock on the door might carry news of her husband's death. To get around the [[British Army]]'s [[postal censorship]], the Tolkiens developed a secret code for his letters home. By using the code, Edith could track her husband's movements on a map of the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]. According to the memoirs of the Reverend Mervyn S. Evers, [[Anglican]] chaplain to the Lancashire Fusiliers:\n[[File:Schwaben Redoubt by William Orpen IWM Art.IWM ART 3000.jpg|thumb|right|''The Schwaben Redoubt'', painting by William Orpen.

He remained profoundly grateful for the lesson. For a long time, he had been imprisoned in a tower, not of pearl, but of ivory.<ref>Garth (2003), pp.&nbsp;94–95.</ref>}}\n\nIn later years, Tolkien indignantly declared that those who searched his works for parallels to the [[Second World War]] were entirely mistaken:\n{{quote|One has indeed personally to come under the shadow of war to feel fully its oppression; but as the years go by it seems now often forgotten that to be caught in youth by 1914 was no less hideous an experience than to be involved in 1939 and the following years.

After Beren was captured by the forces of the [[Dark Lord (fiction)|Dark Lord]] [[Morgoth]], Lúthien rode to his rescue upon the talking [[wolf hunting with dogs|wolfhound]] [[Huan (Middle-earth)|Huan]].

I have the greatest sympathy with Belgium—which is about the right size of any country! I wish my own were bounded still by the seas of the [[River Tweed|Tweed]] and the walls of Wales... we folk do at least know something of mortality and eternity and when [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] (or a Frenchman) says 'Germany (or France) must live forever' we know that he lies.\"<ref>\"The Tolkien Family Album\", (1992), page 69.</ref>\n\nTolkien had an intense hatred for the side effects of industrialization, which he considered to be devouring the English countryside and [[simple living|simpler life]].

''The Lord of the Rings'' is often thought to represent England during and immediately after the Second World War. Tolkien ardently rejected this opinion in the foreword to the second edition of the novel, stating he preferred applicability to allegory.<ref name=MEreffotrForeword/> This theme is taken up at greater length in his essay \"[[On Fairy-Stories]]\", where he argues that fairy-stories are so apt because they are consistent both within themselves and with some truths about reality. He concludes that Christianity itself follows this pattern of inner consistency and external truth. His belief in the fundamental truths of Christianity leads commentators to find Christian themes in ''The Lord of the Rings''. Tolkien objected strongly to C.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;Lewis's use of religious references in his stories, which were often overtly allegorical.<ref>Longenecker, Dwight (2008). \"[http://www.speroforum.com/a/16698/Why-Tolkien-said-No-to-Narnia Why Tolkien said No to Narnia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430143646/http://www.speroforum.com/a/16698/Why-Tolkien-said-No-to-Narnia |date=30 April 2011 }}\", Spero News, 12 November 2008.

Tolkien said, \"I utterly repudiate any such ''reading'', which angers me. The situation was conceived long before the [[October Revolution|Russian revolution]]. Such [[allegory]] is entirely foreign to my thought.\"<ref>''Letters'', no. 229.</ref>\n\n====Opposition to National Socialism====\nTolkien vocally opposed [[Adolf Hitler]] and the [[Nazi Party]] prior to the [[Second World War]], and was known to especially despise [[Nazi]] racist and anti-Semitic ideology. In 1938, the publishing house Rütten & Loening Verlag was preparing to release ''The Hobbit'' in [[Nazi Germany]]. To Tolkien's outrage, he was asked beforehand whether he was of [[Aryan race|Aryan]] origin. In a letter to his British publisher [[Stanley Unwin (publisher)|Stanley Unwin]], he condemned Nazi \"race-doctrine\" as \"wholly pernicious and unscientific\". He added that he had many [[Jewish]] friends and was considering \"letting a German translation go hang\".<ref>''Letters'', no. 29, to Stanley Unwin, 25 July 1938.</ref> He provided two letters to Rütten & Loening and instructed Unwin to send whichever he preferred. The more tactful letter was sent and was lost during the later bombing of Germany. In the unsent letter, Tolkien makes the point that \"[[Aryan]]\" is a linguistic term, denoting speakers of [[Indo-Iranian languages]]. He continued,{{quote|But if I am to understand that you are enquiring whether I am of ''Jewish'' origin, I can only reply that I regret that I appear to have ''no'' ancestors of that gifted people. My great-great-grandfather came to England in the 18th century from Germany: the main part of my descent is therefore purely English, and I am an English subject—which should be sufficient. I have been accustomed, nonetheless, to regard my German name with pride, and continued to do so throughout the period of the late regrettable war, in which I served in the English army. I cannot, however, forbear to comment that if impertinent and irrelevant inquiries of this sort are to become the rule in matters of literature, then the time is not far distant when a German name will no longer be a source of pride.<ref>''Letters'', no. 30.</ref>}}\n\nIn a 1941 letter to his son Michael, he expressed his resentment at the distortion of Germanic history in \"Nordicism\":{{quote|You have to understand the good in things, to detect the real evil. But no one ever calls on me to \"broadcast\" or do a postscript. Yet I suppose I know better than most what is the truth about this \"Nordic\" nonsense. Anyway, I have in this war a burning private grudge... against that ruddy little ignoramus Adolf Hitler ... Ruining, perverting, misapplying, and making for ever accursed, that noble northern spirit, a supreme contribution to Europe, which I have ever loved, and tried to present in its true light. Nowhere, incidentally, was it nobler than in England, nor more early sanctified and Christianized.<ref>''Letters'', no. 45.</ref>}}\n\nIn 1968, he objected to a description of Middle-earth as \"[[Nordic race|Nordic]]\", a term he said he disliked because of its association with [[Nordic theory|racialist theories]].<ref>''Letters'', no. 294.</ref>\n\n====Total war====\nTolkien criticized Allied use of [[total war]] tactics against civilians from [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Imperial Japan]]. In a 1945 letter to his son Christopher, he wrote:{{quote|We were supposed to have reached a stage of civilization in which it might still be necessary to execute a criminal, but not to gloat, or to hang his wife and child by him while the orc-crowd hooted. The destruction of Germany, be it 100 times merited, is one of the most appalling world-catastrophes. Well, well,—you and I can do nothing about it. And that [should] be a measure of the amount of guilt that can justly be assumed to attach to any member of a country who is not a member of its actual Government. Well the first War of the Machines seems to be drawing to its final inconclusive chapter—leaving, alas, everyone the poorer, many bereaved or maimed and millions dead, and only one thing triumphant: the Machines.<ref>''Letters'', no. 96.</ref>}}\n\nHe also reacted with anger at the excesses of [[Anti-German sentiment|anti-German]] propaganda during the war. In 1944, he wrote in a letter to his son Christopher:{{quote|...it is distressing to see the press grovelling in the gutter as low as Goebbels in his prime, shrieking that any German commander who holds out in a desperate situation (when, too, the military needs of his side clearly benefit) is a drunkard, and a besotted fanatic. ... There was a solemn article in the local paper seriously advocating systematic exterminating of the entire German nation as the only proper course after military victory: because, if you please, they are rattlesnakes, and don't know the difference between good and evil! (What of the writer?) The Germans have just as much right to declare the Poles and Jews exterminable vermin, subhuman, as we have to select the Germans: in other words, no right, whatever they have done.<ref>''Letters'', no. 81.</ref>}}\n\nHe was horrified by the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]], referring to the scientists of the [[Manhattan Project]] as \"these lunatic physicists\" and \"[[Tower of Babel|Babel]]-builders\".<ref name=\"atom\">''Letters'', no. 102.</ref>\n\n===Nature===\nDuring most of his own life [[conservationism]] was not yet on the political agenda, and Tolkien himself did not directly express conservationist views—except in some private letters, in which he tells about his fondness for forests and sadness at tree-felling. In later years, a number of authors of biographies or literary analyses of Tolkien conclude that during his writing of ''The Lord of the Rings'', Tolkien gained increased interest in the value of wild and untamed nature, and in protecting what wild nature was left in the industrialized world.<ref>{{cite book |editor1-first=George |editor1-last=Clark |editor2-first=Daniel |editor2-last=Timmons |title=J.R.R.

K. Chesterton engaging in a series of polemical essays with Yeats over the question of the superiority of Irish vs. English fairy tales.<ref name=\"Fimi\"/> Even through there is nothing innately anti-English about Irish folklore, the way in which Irish mythology became associated with Irish nationalism, being promoted most enthusiastically by those favouring Irish independence, led many to perceive Irish mythology and folklore as Anglophobic.<ref name=\"Fimi\"/> Tolkien with his determination to write a \"mythology for England\" was for this reason disinclined to admit to Celtic influences.<ref name=\"Fimi\"/> Fimi noted in particular that the story of the Noldor, the Elves who fled Valinor for Middle-earth, resembles the story related in the ''[[Lebor Gabála Érenn]]'' of the semi-divine [[Tuatha Dé Danann]] who fled from what is variously described as a place in the north or Greece to conquer Ireland.<ref name=\"Fimi\"/> Like Tolkien's Elves, the Tuatha Dé Danann are inferior to the gods, but superior to humans; being endowed with extraordinary skills as craftsmen, poets, warriors, and magicians.<ref name=\"Fimi\"/> Likewise, after the triumph of humanity, both the Elves and the Tuatha Dé Danann are driven underground, which causes their \"fading\", leading them to become diminutive and pale.<ref name=\"Fimi\"/>\n\n====Catholicism====\nCatholic theology and imagery played a part in fashioning Tolkien's creative imagination, suffused as it was by his deeply religious spirit.<ref name=DayTolkiensRing/><ref>{{cite web|last=Bofetti|first=Jason|date=November 2001|url= http://www.crisismagazine.com/november2001/feature7.htm |title=Tolkien's Catholic Imagination|work = Crisis Magazine|accessdate =30 August 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060821111145/http://www.crisismagazine.com/november2001/feature7.htm <!--Added by H3llBot-->|archivedate=21 August 2006}}</ref> Tolkien acknowledged this himself:\n{{quote|''The Lord of the Rings'' is of course a fundamentally religious and Catholic work; unconsciously so at first, but consciously in the revision.

Kocher]] argues that Tolkien describes evil in the orthodox Christian way as the [[absence of good]]. He cites many examples in ''The Lord of the Rings'', such as Sauron's \"Lidless Eye\": \"the black slit of its pupil opened on a pit, a window into nothing\". Kocher sees Tolkien's source as [[Thomas Aquinas]], \"whom it is reasonable to suppose that Tolkien, as a medievalist and a Catholic, knows well\".<ref>{{cite book | last = Kocher | first = Paul H. | year = 1972 | title = Master of Middle-earth: The Fiction of J.

Shippey contends that this Christian view of evil is most clearly stated by Boethius: \"evil is nothing\". He says Tolkien used the corollary that evil cannot create as the basis of [[Frodo]]'s remark, \"the Shadow ... can only mock, it cannot make: not real new things of its own\", and related remarks by [[Treebeard]] and [[Elrond]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Shippey | first = Tom | year = 1983 | title = The Road to Middle-earth | pages = 140–141 | isbn = 0-395-33973-1 | publisher = Houghton Mifflin | location = Boston}}</ref> He goes on to argue that in ''The Lord of the Rings'' evil does sometimes seem to be an independent force, more than merely the absence of good (though not independent to the point of the [[Manichaeism|Manichaean heresy]]), and suggests that Alfred's additions to his translation of Boethius may have inspired that view.<ref>''Road'', pp.&nbsp;141–145.</ref>\n\n[[Stratford Caldecott]] also interpreted the Ring in theological terms: \"The Ring of Power exemplifies the dark magic of the corrupted will, the assertion of self in disobedience to God. It appears to give freedom, but its true function is to enslave the wearer to the Fallen Angel. It corrodes the human will of the wearer, rendering him increasingly 'thin' and unreal; indeed, its gift of invisibility symbolizes this ability to destroy all natural human relationships and identity. You could say the Ring is sin itself: tempting and seemingly harmless to begin with, increasingly hard to give up and corrupting in the long run.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Caldecott |first=Stratford |date=January–February 2002 |url=http://touchstonemag.com/archives/article.php?id=15-01-051-f |title=The Lord & Lady of the Rings |work=Touchstone Magazine |accessdate=27 March 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110426033720/http://touchstonemag.com/archives/article.php?id=15-01-051-f |archivedate=26 April 2011 }}</ref>\n\n===Publications===\n\n====''Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics''====\n{{Main|Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics}}\nAs well as his fiction, Tolkien was also a leading author of academic literary criticism. His seminal 1936 lecture, later published as an article, revolutionized the treatment of the Anglo-Saxon epic ''[[Beowulf]]'' by literary critics. The essay remains highly influential in the study of Old English literature to this day. ''Beowulf'' is one of the most significant influences upon Tolkien's later fiction, with major details of both ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Lord of the Rings'' being adapted from the poem. The piece reveals many of the aspects of ''Beowulf'' which Tolkien found most inspiring, most prominently the role of monsters in literature, particularly that of the dragon which appears in the final third of the poem:{{quote|As for the poem, one dragon, however hot, does not make a summer, or a host; and a man might well exchange for one good dragon what he would not sell for a wilderness. And dragons, real dragons, essential both to the machinery and the ideas of a poem or tale, are actually rare.<ref>Tolkien, J. R. R. (1963). ''Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics''.

Other works included ''[[Mr. Bliss]]'' and ''[[Roverandom]]'' (for children), and ''[[Leaf by Niggle]]'' (part of ''[[Tree and Leaf]]''), ''[[The Adventures of Tom Bombadil]]'', ''[[Smith of Wootton Major]]'' and ''[[Farmer Giles of Ham]]''. ''Roverandom'' and ''Smith of Wootton Major'', like ''The Hobbit'', borrowed ideas from his ''legendarium''.\n\n====''The Hobbit''====\nTolkien never expected his stories to become popular, but by sheer accident a book called ''[[The Hobbit]]'', which he had written some years before for his own children, came in 1936 to the attention of Susan Dagnall, an employee of the London publishing firm [[George Allen & Unwin]], who persuaded Tolkien to submit it for publication.<ref name=\"NYTimes obit\"/> When it was published a year later, the book attracted adult readers as well as children, and it became popular enough for the publishers to ask Tolkien to produce a sequel.\n\n====''The Lord of the Rings''====\nThe request for a sequel prompted Tolkien to begin what would become his most famous work: the epic novel ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' (originally published in three volumes 1954–1955). Tolkien spent more than ten years writing the primary narrative and appendices for ''The Lord of the Rings'', during which time he received the constant support of the [[Inklings]], in particular his closest friend [[C.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;Lewis]], the author of ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia]]''. Both ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Lord of the Rings'' are set against the background of ''The Silmarillion'', but in a time long after it.\n\nTolkien at first intended ''The Lord of the Rings'' to be a children's tale in the style of ''The Hobbit'', but it quickly grew darker and more serious in the writing.<ref>{{cite news|date=5 June 1955 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/01/02/11/specials/tolkien-oxford.html |title=Oxford Calling |work=The New York Times |accessdate=12 March 2006 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090411062443/http://www.nytimes.com/books/01/02/11/specials/tolkien-oxford.html |archivedate=11 April 2009 }}</ref> Though a direct sequel to ''The Hobbit'', it addressed an older audience, drawing on the immense [[backstory]] of [[Beleriand]] that Tolkien had constructed in previous years, and which eventually saw posthumous publication in ''The Silmarillion'' and other volumes.

Tolkien desperately hoped to publish it along with ''The Lord of the Rings'', but publishers (both [[Allen & Unwin]] and [[HarperCollins|Collins]]) declined. Moreover, printing costs were very high in 1950s Britain, requiring ''The Lord of the Rings'' to be published in three volumes.<ref>[[Wayne G. Hammond|Hammond, Wayne G.]] (1993). ''J.R.R.

In subsequent years (1983–1996) he published a large amount of the remaining unpublished materials, together with notes and extensive commentary, in a series of twelve volumes called ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]''. They contain unfinished, abandoned, alternative, and outright contradictory accounts, since they were always a work in progress for Tolkien and he only rarely settled on a definitive version for any of the stories. There is not complete consistency between ''The Lord of the Rings'' and ''The Hobbit'', the two most closely related works, because Tolkien never fully integrated all their traditions into each other. He commented in 1965, while editing ''The Hobbit'' for a third edition, that he would have preferred to completely rewrite the book because of the style of its prose.<ref>{{cite web|last= Martinez |first=Michael|date=27 July 2002|url= http://www.merp.com/essays/MichaelMartinez/michaelmartinezsuite101essay122 |title=Middle-earth Revised, Again |work = Michael Martinez Tolkien Essays |accessdate =28 April 2009|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080617122627/http://www.merp.com/essays/MichaelMartinez/michaelmartinezsuite101essay122 |archivedate = 17 June 2008|deadurl=yes}}</ref>\n\n====''Mr. Bliss''====\nOne of Tolkien's least-known short works is the [[Children's literature|children's storybook]] ''[[Mr. Bliss]]'', published in 1982. It tells the story of Mr. Bliss and his first ride in his new motor-car. Many adventures follow: encounters with bears, angry neighbours, irate shopkeepers, and assorted collisions. The story was inspired by Tolkien's own vehicular mishaps with his first car, purchased in 1932. The bears were based on toy bears owned by Tolkien's sons. Tolkien was both author and illustrator of the book. He submitted it to his publishers as a balm to readers who were hungry for more from him after the success of ''The Hobbit''. The lavish ink and coloured-pencil illustrations would have made production costs prohibitively expensive. Tolkien agreed to redraw the pictures in a simpler style, but then found he did not have time to do so. The book was published in 1982 as a facsimile of Tolkien's difficult-to-read illustrated manuscript, with a typeset transcription on each facing page.\n\n====''The Children of Húrin''====\nMore recently, in 2007, ''[[The Children of Húrin]]'' was published by [[HarperCollins]] (in the UK and Canada) and [[Houghton Mifflin]] (in the US). The novel tells the story of [[Túrin Turambar]] and his sister [[Nienor]], children of [[Húrin|Húrin Thalion]]. The material was compiled by Christopher Tolkien from ''The Silmarillion'', ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]'', and unpublished manuscripts.\n\n====''The Legend of Sigurd and Gudrún''====\n''[[The Legend of Sigurd and Gudrún]]'', which was released worldwide on 5 May 2009 by HarperCollins and Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, retells the legend of [[Sigurd]] and the fall of the [[Niflungs]] from Germanic mythology. It is a [[narrative poem]] composed in [[alliterative verse]] and is modelled after the [[Old Norse]] poetry of the [[Elder Edda]]. Christopher Tolkien supplied copious notes and commentary upon his father's work.\n\nAccording to Christopher Tolkien, it is no longer possible to trace the exact date of the work's composition. On the basis of circumstantial evidence, he suggests that it dates from the 1930s. In his foreword he wrote, \"He scarcely ever (to my knowledge) referred to them. For my part, I cannot recall any conversation with him on the subject until very near the end of his life, when he spoke of them to me, and tried unsuccessfully to find them.\"<ref>''The Legend of Sigurd and Gudrún'', page 5.</ref> In a 1967 letter to [[W.

Though inspired by high medieval Arthurian fiction, the historical setting of the poem is during the Post-Roman [[Migration Period]], both in form (using [[Germanic poetry|Germanic verse]]) and in content, showing Arthur as a [[Sub-Roman Britain|British]] [[warlord]] fighting the [[Anglo-Saxon invasion of Britain|Saxon invasion]], while it avoids the high medieval aspects of the Arthurian cycle (such as the Grail, and the courtly setting); the poem begins with a British \"counter-invasion\" to the [[Old Saxony|Saxon lands]] (''Arthur eastward in arms purposed'').<ref>announcing the 2013 edition, ''[[The Guardian]]'' on 9 October 2012 published the poem's first nine verses; Alison Flood, [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/oct/09/jrr-tolkien-new-poem-king-arthur 'New' JRR Tolkien epic due out next year] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161202023157/https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/oct/09/jrr-tolkien-new-poem-king-arthur |date=2 December 2016 }} guardian.co.uk, Tuesday 9 October 2012.</ref>\n\n====''Beowulf: A Translation and Commentary''====\n''[[Beowulf: A Translation and Commentary]]'', published on 22 May 2014, is a prose translation of the early medieval epic poem ''[[Beowulf]]'' from [[Old English]] to modern English.

The most developed of these are [[Quenya]] and [[Sindarin]], the etymological connection between which formed the core of much of Tolkien's ''legendarium''. Language and grammar for Tolkien was a matter of [[aesthetics]] and [[euphony]], and Quenya in particular was designed from \"phonaesthetic\" considerations; it was intended as an \"Elvenlatin\", and was phonologically based on Latin, with ingredients from Finnish, Welsh, English, and Greek.<ref name=\"letter144\">''Letters'', no. 144.</ref> A notable addition came in late 1945 with [[Adûnaic]] or [[Númenórean]], a language of a \"faintly [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] flavour\", connected with Tolkien's [[Atlantis]] legend, which by ''[[The Notion Club Papers]]'' ties directly into his ideas about the inability of language to be inherited, and via the \"[[Second Age]]\" and the story of [[Eärendil]] was grounded in the ''legendarium'', thereby providing a link of Tolkien's 20th-century \"real primary world\" with the legendary past of his Middle-earth.\n\nTolkien considered languages inseparable from the mythology associated with them, and he consequently took a dim view of [[International auxiliary language|auxiliary languages]]: in 1930 a congress of Esperantists were told as much by him, in his lecture ''[[A Secret Vice]]'',<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.bl.uk/european/2018/01/tolkiens-secret-vice.html|title=Tolkien's 'Secret Vice'|last=Corsetti|first=Renato|date=31 January 2018|website=British Library}}</ref> \"Your language construction will breed a mythology\", but by 1956 he had concluded that \"[[Volapük]], [[Esperanto]], [[Ido (language)|Ido]], [[Novial]], &c, &c, are dead, far deader than ancient unused languages, because their authors never invented any Esperanto legends\".<ref name=\"letter180\">''Letters'', no. 180.</ref>\n\nThe popularity of Tolkien's books has had a small but lasting effect on the use of language in fantasy literature in particular, and even on mainstream dictionaries, which today commonly accept Tolkien's idiosyncratic spellings ''dwarves'' and ''dwarvish'' (alongside ''dwarfs'' and ''dwarfish''), which had been little used since the mid-19th century and earlier. (In fact, according to Tolkien, had the [[Old English]] plural survived, it would have been ''dwarrows'' or ''dwerrows''.) He also coined the term ''[[eucatastrophe]]'', though it remains mainly used in connection with his own work.\n\n== Artwork ==\n{{Expand section|date=May 2018}}\nHe was an accomplished artist, who learned to paint and draw as a child and continued to do so all his life.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.connexionfrance.com/Mag/Big-Picture/The-fine-art-of-weaving-a-Tolkien-tale|title=The fine art of weaving a Tolkien tale|last=France|first=Connexion|website=www.connexionfrance.com|access-date=7 March 2018}}</ref> From early in his writing career, the development of his stories was accompanied by drawings and paintings, especially of landscapes, and by maps of the lands in which the tales were set. He also produced pictures to accompany the stories told to his own children, including those later published in ''Mr Bliss'' and ''Roverandom'', and sent them elaborately illustrated letters purporting to come from Father Christmas. Although he regarded himself as an amateur, the publisher used the author's own cover art, maps, and full-page illustrations for the early editions of ''The Hobbit''. Much of his artwork was collected and published in 1995 as a book: ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien: Artist and Illustrator]]''. The book discusses the paintings, drawings, and sketches of J.R.R.

Personally known to him were [[Pauline Baynes]] (Tolkien's favourite illustrator of ''[[The Adventures of Tom Bombadil]]'' and ''[[Farmer Giles of Ham]]'') and [[Donald Swann]] (who set the music to ''[[The Road Goes Ever On]]''). Queen [[Margrethe II of Denmark]] created illustrations to ''The Lord of the Rings'' in the early 1970s.

In 1946, he rejected suggestions for illustrations by Horus Engels for the German edition of ''The Hobbit'' as \"too [[The Walt Disney Company|Disnified]] ... Bilbo with a dribbling nose, and [[Gandalf]] as a figure of vulgar fun rather than the [[Odin]]ic wanderer that I think of\".<ref>''Letters'', no. 107.</ref>\n\nTolkien was sceptical of the emerging [[Tolkien fandom]] in the United States, and in 1954 he returned proposals for the dust jackets of the American edition of ''The Lord of the Rings'':\n{{quote|Thank you for sending me the projected \"blurbs\", which I return. The Americans are not as a rule at all amenable to criticism or correction; but I think their effort is so poor that I feel constrained to make some effort to improve it.<ref name=\"letter144\"/>}}\n\nHe had dismissed dramatic representations of fantasy in his essay \"[[On Fairy-Stories]]\", first presented in 1939:\n{{quote|In human art Fantasy is a thing best left to words, to true literature. ...

He was not implacably opposed to the idea of a dramatic adaptation, however, and sold the film, stage and merchandise rights of ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Lord of the Rings'' to [[United Artists]] in 1968. United Artists never made a film, although director [[John Boorman]] was planning a live-action film in the early 1970s. In 1976, the rights were sold to [[Tolkien Enterprises]], a division of the [[Saul Zaentz]] Company, and the first film adaptation of ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' was released in 1978 as an animated [[rotoscoping]] film directed by [[Ralph Bakshi]] with screenplay by the fantasy writer [[Peter S.

I don't regret my decision, though it was very hard on my lover. But it was not my fault. She was completely free and under no vow to me, and I should have had no just complaint (except according to the unreal romantic code) if she had got married to someone else. For very nearly ''three'' years I did not see or write to my lover. It was extremely hard, especially at first. The effects were not wholly good: I fell back into folly and slackness and misspent a good deal of my first year at college.<ref name=\"Letters, No. 43\"/>}}\n\nOn the evening of his 21st birthday, Tolkien wrote to Edith, who was living with family friend C. H. Jessop at [[Cheltenham]]. He declared that he had never ceased to love her and asked her to marry him. Edith replied that she had already accepted the proposal of George Field, the brother of one of her closest schoolfriends. Edith said, however, that she had agreed to marry Field only because she felt \"on the shelf\" and had begun to doubt that Tolkien still cared for her. She explained that, because of Tolkien's letter, everything had changed.\n\nOn 8 January 1913, Tolkien travelled by train to Cheltenham and was met on the platform by Edith. The two took a walk into the countryside, sat under a railway viaduct, and talked. By the end of the day, Edith had agreed to accept Tolkien's proposal. She wrote to Field and returned her engagement ring. Field was \"dreadfully upset at first\", and the Field family was \"insulted and angry\".<ref>''Biography'', pp.&nbsp;67–69.</ref> Upon learning of Edith's new plans, Jessop wrote to her guardian, \"I have nothing to say against Tolkien, he is a cultured gentleman, but his prospects are poor in the extreme, and when he will be in a position to marry I cannot imagine. Had he adopted a profession it would have been different.\"<ref>''The Tolkien Family Album'', (1992), page 34.</ref>\n\nFollowing their engagement, Edith reluctantly announced that she was converting to Catholicism at Tolkien's insistence.  Jessop, \"like many others of his age and class ... strongly [[anti-Catholicism|anti-Catholic]]\", was infuriated, and he ordered Edith to find other lodgings.<ref>''Biography'', p.&nbsp;73.</ref>\n\nEdith Bratt and Ronald Tolkien were formally engaged at Birmingham in January 1913, and married at [[St. Mary Immaculate Roman Catholic Church, Warwick]], on 22 March 1916.<ref>''Biography'', p.&nbsp;86.</ref> In his 1941 letter to Michael, Tolkien expressed admiration for his wife's willingness to marry a man with no job, little money, and no prospects except the likelihood of being killed in the Great War.<ref name=\"Letters, No. 43\"/>\n\n===First World War===\nIn August 1914 the United Kingdom entered the [[First World War]]. Tolkien's relatives were shocked when he elected not to immediately volunteer for the [[British Army]]. In a 1941 letter to his son Michael, Tolkien recalled, \"In those days chaps joined up, or were scorned publicly. It was a nasty cleft to be in for a young man with too much imagination and little physical courage.\"<ref name=\"Letters, No. 43\"/>\n\nInstead, Tolkien, \"endured the obloquy\",<ref name=\"Letters, No. 43\"/> and entered a programme wherein he delayed enlistment until completing his degree. By the time he passed his Finals in July 1915, Tolkien recalled that the hints were \"becoming outspoken from relatives\".<ref name=\"Letters, No. 43\"/> He was then commissioned as a temporary [[second lieutenant]] in the [[Lancashire Fusiliers]] on 15 July 1915.<ref>''Biography'', pp.&nbsp;77–85.</ref><ref>{{London Gazette|issue=29232|page=6968|date=16 July 1915}}</ref> He trained with the 13th (Reserve) Battalion on [[Cannock Chase]], [[Staffordshire]], for eleven months. In a letter to Edith, Tolkien complained, \"Gentlemen are rare among the superiors, and even human beings rare indeed.\"<ref>''Tolkien and the Great War'', p.&nbsp;94.</ref> Following their wedding, Lieutenant and Mrs. Tolkien took up lodgings near the training camp.\n\nOn 2 June 1916, Tolkien received a telegram summoning him to [[Folkestone]] for posting to France. The Tolkiens spent the night before his departure in a room at the Plough & Harrow Hotel in [[Edgbaston]], Birmingham.\n\nHe later wrote, \"Junior officers were being killed off, a dozen a minute. Parting from my wife then&nbsp;... it was like a death.\"<ref>Quoted in John Garth, ''Tolkien and the Great War'', p.&nbsp;138.</ref>\n\n====France====\nOn 5 June 1916, Tolkien boarded a troop transport for an overnight voyage to [[Calais]]. Like other soldiers arriving for the first time, he was sent to the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]]'s (BEF) base depot at [[Étaples]]. On 7 June, he was informed that he had been assigned as a signals officer to the 11th (Service) Battalion, Lancashire Fusiliers. The battalion was part of the [[74th Brigade (United Kingdom)|74th Brigade]], [[25th Division (United Kingdom)|25th Division]].\n\nWhile waiting to be summoned to his unit, Tolkien sank into boredom. To pass the time, he composed a poem entitled ''The Lonely Isle'', which was inspired by his feelings during the sea crossing to Calais. To evade the British Army's [[postal censorship]], he also developed a code of dots by which Edith could track his movements.<ref>Garth, John. ''Tolkien and the Great War'', Boston, Houghton Mifflin 2003, pp.&nbsp;144–145.</ref>\n\nHe left Étaples on 27 June 1916 and joined his battalion at [[Rubempré]], near [[Amiens]].<ref>Garth (2003), pages 147–148.</ref> He found himself commanding enlisted men who were drawn mainly from the mining, milling, and weaving towns of Lancashire.<ref>Garth (2003), pp.&nbsp;148–149.</ref> According to John Garth, he \"felt an affinity for these working class men\", but military protocol forbade him from developing friendships with \"[[Other ranks (UK)|other ranks]]\". Instead, he was required to \"take charge of them, discipline them, train them, and probably censor their letters ... If possible, he was supposed to inspire their love and loyalty.\"<ref name=\"Garth149\">Garth (2003), p.&nbsp;149.</ref>\n\nTolkien later lamented, \"The most improper job of any man ... is bossing other men. Not one in a million is fit for it, and least of all those who seek the opportunity.\"<ref name=\"Garth149\"/>\n\n====Battle of the Somme====\nTolkien arrived at the [[Battle of the Somme|Somme]] in early July 1916. In between terms behind the lines at [[Bouzincourt]], he participated in the assaults on the [[Schwaben Redoubt]] and the [[Leipzig salient]]. Tolkien's time in combat was a terrible stress for Edith, who feared that every knock on the door might carry news of her husband's death. To get around the [[British Army]]'s [[postal censorship]], the Tolkiens developed a secret code for his letters home. By using the code, Edith could track her husband's movements on a map of the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]. According to the memoirs of the Reverend Mervyn S. Evers, [[Anglican]] chaplain to the Lancashire Fusiliers:\n[[File:Schwaben Redoubt by William Orpen IWM Art.IWM ART 3000.jpg|thumb|right|''The Schwaben Redoubt'', painting by William Orpen.

So we went round to the Medical Officer, who was also in the dugout with his equipment, and he gave us some ointment which he assured us would keep the little brutes away. We anointed ourselves all over with the stuff and again lay down in great hopes, but it was not to be, because instead of discouraging them it seemed to act like a kind of ''[[hors d'oeuvre]]'' and the little beggars went at their feast with renewed vigour.<ref>Quoted in Garth (2003), p.&nbsp;200.</ref>}}\n\nOn 27 October 1916, as his battalion attacked [[Regina Trench]], Tolkien came down with [[trench fever]], a disease carried by the [[lice]].

Among their number were Rob Gilson of the Tea Club and Barrovian Society, who was killed on the [[first day of the Somme]] while leading his men in the assault on [[Beaumont Hamel]].

Tolkien wrote that the experience taught him, \"a deep sympathy and feeling for the [[Tommy Atkins|Tommy]]; especially the plain soldier from the agricultural counties\". He remained profoundly grateful for the lesson. For a long time, he had been imprisoned in a tower, not of pearl, but of ivory.<ref>Garth (2003), pp.&nbsp;94–95.</ref>}}\n\nIn later years, Tolkien indignantly declared that those who searched his works for parallels to the [[Second World War]] were entirely mistaken:\n{{quote|One has indeed personally to come under the shadow of war to feel fully its oppression; but as the years go by it seems now often forgotten that to be caught in youth by 1914 was no less hideous an experience than to be involved in 1939 and the following years.

Tolkien's status as a best-selling author gave them easy entry into polite society, but Tolkien deeply missed the company of his fellow [[Inklings]]. Edith, however, was overjoyed to step into the role of a society hostess, which had been the reason that Tolkien selected Bournemouth in the first place.\n\nAccording to [[Humphrey Carpenter]]:\n\n{{quote|Those friends who knew Ronald and Edith Tolkien over the years never doubted that there was deep affection between them. It was visible in the small things, the almost absurd degree in which each worried about the other's health, and the care in which they chose and wrapped each other's birthday presents; and in the large matters, the way in which Ronald willingly abandoned such a large part of his life in retirement to give Edith the last years in Bournemouth that he felt she deserved, and the degree in which she showed pride in his fame as an author. A principal source of happiness to them was their shared love of their family. This bound them together until the end of their lives, and it was perhaps the strongest force in the marriage. They delighted to discuss and mull over every detail of the lives of their children, and later their grandchildren.<ref>Humphrey Carpenter, \"Tolkien: The Authorized Biography\", page 158.</ref>}}\n\n===Final years===\nEdith Tolkien died on 29 November 1971, at the age of 82.

After Beren was captured by the forces of the [[Dark Lord (fiction)|Dark Lord]] [[Morgoth]], Lúthien rode to his rescue upon the talking [[wolf hunting with dogs|wolfhound]] [[Huan (Middle-earth)|Huan]]. Ultimately, when Beren was slain in battle against the demonic wolf [[Carcharoth]], Lúthien, like [[Orpheus]], approached the [[Vala (Middle-earth)|Valar]], the angelic order of beings placed in charge of the world by Eru (God), and persuaded them to restore her beloved to life.\n\n==Views==\n[[File:Eagle and Child (interior).jpg|thumb|right|The Corner of [[the Eagle and Child]] Pub, Oxford, where the [[Inklings]] met (1930–1950)]]\nTolkien was a devout [[Roman Catholic]], and in his religious and political views he was mostly a traditionalist moderate, with [[Libertarianism|libertarian]], [[Distributism|distributist]], and [[monarchism|monarchist]] leanings, in the sense of favouring established conventions and orthodoxies over innovation and modernization, whilst castigating government bureaucracy; in 1943 he wrote, \"My political opinions lean more and more to Anarchy ([[philosophical anarchism|philosophically understood]], meaning abolition of control not whiskered men with bombs)—or to 'unconstitutional' [[monarchism|Monarchy]].\"<ref>''Letters'', no. 52, to Christopher Tolkien, 29 November 1943</ref>\n\nAlthough he did not often write or speak about it, Tolkien advocated the dismantling of the [[British Empire]] and even of the United Kingdom. In a 1936 letter to a former student, Belgian linguist Simonne d'Ardenne, he wrote, \"The political situation is dreadful... I have the greatest sympathy with Belgium—which is about the right size of any country! I wish my own were bounded still by the seas of the [[River Tweed|Tweed]] and the walls of Wales... we folk do at least know something of mortality and eternity and when [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] (or a Frenchman) says 'Germany (or France) must live forever' we know that he lies.\"<ref>\"The Tolkien Family Album\", (1992), page 69.</ref>\n\nTolkien had an intense hatred for the side effects of industrialization, which he considered to be devouring the English countryside and [[simple living|simpler life]]. For most of his adult life, he was disdainful of cars, preferring to ride a bicycle.<ref>''Letters'', nos. 64, 131, etc.</ref> This attitude can be seen in his work, most famously in the portrayal of the forced \"industrialization\" of the [[Shire (Middle-earth)|Shire]] in ''The Lord of the Rings''.<ref>{{cite video | title = J.

''The Lord of the Rings'' is often thought to represent England during and immediately after the Second World War. Tolkien ardently rejected this opinion in the foreword to the second edition of the novel, stating he preferred applicability to allegory.<ref name=MEreffotrForeword/> This theme is taken up at greater length in his essay \"[[On Fairy-Stories]]\", where he argues that fairy-stories are so apt because they are consistent both within themselves and with some truths about reality. He concludes that Christianity itself follows this pattern of inner consistency and external truth. His belief in the fundamental truths of Christianity leads commentators to find Christian themes in ''The Lord of the Rings''. Tolkien objected strongly to C.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;Lewis's use of religious references in his stories, which were often overtly allegorical.<ref>Longenecker, Dwight (2008). \"[http://www.speroforum.com/a/16698/Why-Tolkien-said-No-to-Narnia Why Tolkien said No to Narnia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430143646/http://www.speroforum.com/a/16698/Why-Tolkien-said-No-to-Narnia |date=30 April 2011 }}\", Spero News, 12 November 2008.

He was a devout Roman Catholic and it was soon after the Church had changed the liturgy from Latin to English.

I found the whole experience quite excruciating, but my grandfather was oblivious. He simply had to do what he believed to be right.<ref name=\"SimonTolkien\"/>}}\n\n===Politics and race===\n\n====Anti-Communism====\nTolkien voiced support for the [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|Nationalists]] (eventually led by [[Francisco Franco|Franco]] during the [[Spanish Civil War]]) upon hearing that communist [[Second Spanish Republic|Republicans]] were destroying churches and [[Red Terror (Spain)|killing priests and nuns]].<ref name=\"Letters83\">''Letters'', no. 83.</ref>\n\nTolkien was contemptuous of [[Joseph Stalin]]. During World War{{nbsp}}II, Tolkien referred to Stalin as \"that bloodthirsty old murderer\".<ref>''Letters'', no. 53.</ref> However, in 1961, Tolkien sharply criticized a Swedish commentator who suggested that ''The Lord of the Rings'' was an [[anti-communist]] [[parable]] and identified [[Sauron]] with Stalin. Tolkien said, \"I utterly repudiate any such ''reading'', which angers me. The situation was conceived long before the [[October Revolution|Russian revolution]]. Such [[allegory]] is entirely foreign to my thought.\"<ref>''Letters'', no. 229.</ref>\n\n====Opposition to National Socialism====\nTolkien vocally opposed [[Adolf Hitler]] and the [[Nazi Party]] prior to the [[Second World War]], and was known to especially despise [[Nazi]] racist and anti-Semitic ideology. In 1938, the publishing house Rütten & Loening Verlag was preparing to release ''The Hobbit'' in [[Nazi Germany]]. To Tolkien's outrage, he was asked beforehand whether he was of [[Aryan race|Aryan]] origin. In a letter to his British publisher [[Stanley Unwin (publisher)|Stanley Unwin]], he condemned Nazi \"race-doctrine\" as \"wholly pernicious and unscientific\". He added that he had many [[Jewish]] friends and was considering \"letting a German translation go hang\".<ref>''Letters'', no. 29, to Stanley Unwin, 25 July 1938.</ref> He provided two letters to Rütten & Loening and instructed Unwin to send whichever he preferred. The more tactful letter was sent and was lost during the later bombing of Germany. In the unsent letter, Tolkien makes the point that \"[[Aryan]]\" is a linguistic term, denoting speakers of [[Indo-Iranian languages]]. He continued,{{quote|But if I am to understand that you are enquiring whether I am of ''Jewish'' origin, I can only reply that I regret that I appear to have ''no'' ancestors of that gifted people. My great-great-grandfather came to England in the 18th century from Germany: the main part of my descent is therefore purely English, and I am an English subject—which should be sufficient. I have been accustomed, nonetheless, to regard my German name with pride, and continued to do so throughout the period of the late regrettable war, in which I served in the English army. I cannot, however, forbear to comment that if impertinent and irrelevant inquiries of this sort are to become the rule in matters of literature, then the time is not far distant when a German name will no longer be a source of pride.<ref>''Letters'', no. 30.</ref>}}\n\nIn a 1941 letter to his son Michael, he expressed his resentment at the distortion of Germanic history in \"Nordicism\":{{quote|You have to understand the good in things, to detect the real evil. But no one ever calls on me to \"broadcast\" or do a postscript. Yet I suppose I know better than most what is the truth about this \"Nordic\" nonsense. Anyway, I have in this war a burning private grudge... against that ruddy little ignoramus Adolf Hitler ... Ruining, perverting, misapplying, and making for ever accursed, that noble northern spirit, a supreme contribution to Europe, which I have ever loved, and tried to present in its true light. Nowhere, incidentally, was it nobler than in England, nor more early sanctified and Christianized.<ref>''Letters'', no. 45.</ref>}}\n\nIn 1968, he objected to a description of Middle-earth as \"[[Nordic race|Nordic]]\", a term he said he disliked because of its association with [[Nordic theory|racialist theories]].<ref>''Letters'', no. 294.</ref>\n\n====Total war====\nTolkien criticized Allied use of [[total war]] tactics against civilians from [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Imperial Japan]]. In a 1945 letter to his son Christopher, he wrote:{{quote|We were supposed to have reached a stage of civilization in which it might still be necessary to execute a criminal, but not to gloat, or to hang his wife and child by him while the orc-crowd hooted. The destruction of Germany, be it 100 times merited, is one of the most appalling world-catastrophes. Well, well,—you and I can do nothing about it. And that [should] be a measure of the amount of guilt that can justly be assumed to attach to any member of a country who is not a member of its actual Government. Well the first War of the Machines seems to be drawing to its final inconclusive chapter—leaving, alas, everyone the poorer, many bereaved or maimed and millions dead, and only one thing triumphant: the Machines.<ref>''Letters'', no. 96.</ref>}}\n\nHe also reacted with anger at the excesses of [[Anti-German sentiment|anti-German]] propaganda during the war. In 1944, he wrote in a letter to his son Christopher:{{quote|...it is distressing to see the press grovelling in the gutter as low as Goebbels in his prime, shrieking that any German commander who holds out in a desperate situation (when, too, the military needs of his side clearly benefit) is a drunkard, and a besotted fanatic. ... There was a solemn article in the local paper seriously advocating systematic exterminating of the entire German nation as the only proper course after military victory: because, if you please, they are rattlesnakes, and don't know the difference between good and evil! (What of the writer?) The Germans have just as much right to declare the Poles and Jews exterminable vermin, subhuman, as we have to select the Germans: in other words, no right, whatever they have done.<ref>''Letters'', no. 81.</ref>}}\n\nHe was horrified by the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]], referring to the scientists of the [[Manhattan Project]] as \"these lunatic physicists\" and \"[[Tower of Babel|Babel]]-builders\".<ref name=\"atom\">''Letters'', no. 102.</ref>\n\n===Nature===\nDuring most of his own life [[conservationism]] was not yet on the political agenda, and Tolkien himself did not directly express conservationist views—except in some private letters, in which he tells about his fondness for forests and sadness at tree-felling. In later years, a number of authors of biographies or literary analyses of Tolkien conclude that during his writing of ''The Lord of the Rings'', Tolkien gained increased interest in the value of wild and untamed nature, and in protecting what wild nature was left in the industrialized world.<ref>{{cite book |editor1-first=George |editor1-last=Clark |editor2-first=Daniel |editor2-last=Timmons |title=J.R.R.

K. Chesterton engaging in a series of polemical essays with Yeats over the question of the superiority of Irish vs. English fairy tales.<ref name=\"Fimi\"/> Even through there is nothing innately anti-English about Irish folklore, the way in which Irish mythology became associated with Irish nationalism, being promoted most enthusiastically by those favouring Irish independence, led many to perceive Irish mythology and folklore as Anglophobic.<ref name=\"Fimi\"/> Tolkien with his determination to write a \"mythology for England\" was for this reason disinclined to admit to Celtic influences.<ref name=\"Fimi\"/> Fimi noted in particular that the story of the Noldor, the Elves who fled Valinor for Middle-earth, resembles the story related in the ''[[Lebor Gabála Érenn]]'' of the semi-divine [[Tuatha Dé Danann]] who fled from what is variously described as a place in the north or Greece to conquer Ireland.<ref name=\"Fimi\"/> Like Tolkien's Elves, the Tuatha Dé Danann are inferior to the gods, but superior to humans; being endowed with extraordinary skills as craftsmen, poets, warriors, and magicians.<ref name=\"Fimi\"/> Likewise, after the triumph of humanity, both the Elves and the Tuatha Dé Danann are driven underground, which causes their \"fading\", leading them to become diminutive and pale.<ref name=\"Fimi\"/>\n\n====Catholicism====\nCatholic theology and imagery played a part in fashioning Tolkien's creative imagination, suffused as it was by his deeply religious spirit.<ref name=DayTolkiensRing/><ref>{{cite web|last=Bofetti|first=Jason|date=November 2001|url= http://www.crisismagazine.com/november2001/feature7.htm |title=Tolkien's Catholic Imagination|work = Crisis Magazine|accessdate =30 August 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060821111145/http://www.crisismagazine.com/november2001/feature7.htm <!--Added by H3llBot-->|archivedate=21 August 2006}}</ref> Tolkien acknowledged this himself:\n{{quote|''The Lord of the Rings'' is of course a fundamentally religious and Catholic work; unconsciously so at first, but consciously in the revision.

Kocher]] argues that Tolkien describes evil in the orthodox Christian way as the [[absence of good]]. He cites many examples in ''The Lord of the Rings'', such as Sauron's \"Lidless Eye\": \"the black slit of its pupil opened on a pit, a window into nothing\". Kocher sees Tolkien's source as [[Thomas Aquinas]], \"whom it is reasonable to suppose that Tolkien, as a medievalist and a Catholic, knows well\".<ref>{{cite book | last = Kocher | first = Paul H. | year = 1972 | title = Master of Middle-earth: The Fiction of J.

Shippey contends that this Christian view of evil is most clearly stated by Boethius: \"evil is nothing\". He says Tolkien used the corollary that evil cannot create as the basis of [[Frodo]]'s remark, \"the Shadow ... can only mock, it cannot make: not real new things of its own\", and related remarks by [[Treebeard]] and [[Elrond]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Shippey | first = Tom | year = 1983 | title = The Road to Middle-earth | pages = 140–141 | isbn = 0-395-33973-1 | publisher = Houghton Mifflin | location = Boston}}</ref> He goes on to argue that in ''The Lord of the Rings'' evil does sometimes seem to be an independent force, more than merely the absence of good (though not independent to the point of the [[Manichaeism|Manichaean heresy]]), and suggests that Alfred's additions to his translation of Boethius may have inspired that view.<ref>''Road'', pp.&nbsp;141–145.</ref>\n\n[[Stratford Caldecott]] also interpreted the Ring in theological terms: \"The Ring of Power exemplifies the dark magic of the corrupted will, the assertion of self in disobedience to God. It appears to give freedom, but its true function is to enslave the wearer to the Fallen Angel. It corrodes the human will of the wearer, rendering him increasingly 'thin' and unreal; indeed, its gift of invisibility symbolizes this ability to destroy all natural human relationships and identity. You could say the Ring is sin itself: tempting and seemingly harmless to begin with, increasingly hard to give up and corrupting in the long run.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Caldecott |first=Stratford |date=January–February 2002 |url=http://touchstonemag.com/archives/article.php?id=15-01-051-f |title=The Lord & Lady of the Rings |work=Touchstone Magazine |accessdate=27 March 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110426033720/http://touchstonemag.com/archives/article.php?id=15-01-051-f |archivedate=26 April 2011 }}</ref>\n\n===Publications===\n\n====''Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics''====\n{{Main|Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics}}\nAs well as his fiction, Tolkien was also a leading author of academic literary criticism. His seminal 1936 lecture, later published as an article, revolutionized the treatment of the Anglo-Saxon epic ''[[Beowulf]]'' by literary critics. The essay remains highly influential in the study of Old English literature to this day. ''Beowulf'' is one of the most significant influences upon Tolkien's later fiction, with major details of both ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Lord of the Rings'' being adapted from the poem. The piece reveals many of the aspects of ''Beowulf'' which Tolkien found most inspiring, most prominently the role of monsters in literature, particularly that of the dragon which appears in the final third of the poem:{{quote|As for the poem, one dragon, however hot, does not make a summer, or a host; and a man might well exchange for one good dragon what he would not sell for a wilderness. And dragons, real dragons, essential both to the machinery and the ideas of a poem or tale, are actually rare.<ref>Tolkien, J. R. R. (1963). ''Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics''.

''Roverandom'' and ''Smith of Wootton Major'', like ''The Hobbit'', borrowed ideas from his ''legendarium''.\n\n====''The Hobbit''====\nTolkien never expected his stories to become popular, but by sheer accident a book called ''[[The Hobbit]]'', which he had written some years before for his own children, came in 1936 to the attention of Susan Dagnall, an employee of the London publishing firm [[George Allen & Unwin]], who persuaded Tolkien to submit it for publication.<ref name=\"NYTimes obit\"/> When it was published a year later, the book attracted adult readers as well as children, and it became popular enough for the publishers to ask Tolkien to produce a sequel.\n\n====''The Lord of the Rings''====\nThe request for a sequel prompted Tolkien to begin what would become his most famous work: the epic novel ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' (originally published in three volumes 1954–1955). Tolkien spent more than ten years writing the primary narrative and appendices for ''The Lord of the Rings'', during which time he received the constant support of the [[Inklings]], in particular his closest friend [[C.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;Lewis]], the author of ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia]]''. Both ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Lord of the Rings'' are set against the background of ''The Silmarillion'', but in a time long after it.\n\nTolkien at first intended ''The Lord of the Rings'' to be a children's tale in the style of ''The Hobbit'', but it quickly grew darker and more serious in the writing.<ref>{{cite news|date=5 June 1955 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/01/02/11/specials/tolkien-oxford.html |title=Oxford Calling |work=The New York Times |accessdate=12 March 2006 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090411062443/http://www.nytimes.com/books/01/02/11/specials/tolkien-oxford.html |archivedate=11 April 2009 }}</ref> Though a direct sequel to ''The Hobbit'', it addressed an older audience, drawing on the immense [[backstory]] of [[Beleriand]] that Tolkien had constructed in previous years, and which eventually saw posthumous publication in ''The Silmarillion'' and other volumes.

Tolkien desperately hoped to publish it along with ''The Lord of the Rings'', but publishers (both [[Allen & Unwin]] and [[HarperCollins|Collins]]) declined.

In subsequent years (1983–1996) he published a large amount of the remaining unpublished materials, together with notes and extensive commentary, in a series of twelve volumes called ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]''. They contain unfinished, abandoned, alternative, and outright contradictory accounts, since they were always a work in progress for Tolkien and he only rarely settled on a definitive version for any of the stories. There is not complete consistency between ''The Lord of the Rings'' and ''The Hobbit'', the two most closely related works, because Tolkien never fully integrated all their traditions into each other. He commented in 1965, while editing ''The Hobbit'' for a third edition, that he would have preferred to completely rewrite the book because of the style of its prose.<ref>{{cite web|last= Martinez |first=Michael|date=27 July 2002|url= http://www.merp.com/essays/MichaelMartinez/michaelmartinezsuite101essay122 |title=Middle-earth Revised, Again |work = Michael Martinez Tolkien Essays |accessdate =28 April 2009|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080617122627/http://www.merp.com/essays/MichaelMartinez/michaelmartinezsuite101essay122 |archivedate = 17 June 2008|deadurl=yes}}</ref>\n\n====''Mr. Bliss''====\nOne of Tolkien's least-known short works is the [[Children's literature|children's storybook]] ''[[Mr. Bliss]]'', published in 1982. It tells the story of Mr. Bliss and his first ride in his new motor-car. Many adventures follow: encounters with bears, angry neighbours, irate shopkeepers, and assorted collisions. The story was inspired by Tolkien's own vehicular mishaps with his first car, purchased in 1932. The bears were based on toy bears owned by Tolkien's sons. Tolkien was both author and illustrator of the book. He submitted it to his publishers as a balm to readers who were hungry for more from him after the success of ''The Hobbit''. The lavish ink and coloured-pencil illustrations would have made production costs prohibitively expensive. Tolkien agreed to redraw the pictures in a simpler style, but then found he did not have time to do so. The book was published in 1982 as a facsimile of Tolkien's difficult-to-read illustrated manuscript, with a typeset transcription on each facing page.\n\n====''The Children of Húrin''====\nMore recently, in 2007, ''[[The Children of Húrin]]'' was published by [[HarperCollins]] (in the UK and Canada) and [[Houghton Mifflin]] (in the US). The novel tells the story of [[Túrin Turambar]] and his sister [[Nienor]], children of [[Húrin|Húrin Thalion]]. The material was compiled by Christopher Tolkien from ''The Silmarillion'', ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]'', and unpublished manuscripts.\n\n====''The Legend of Sigurd and Gudrún''====\n''[[The Legend of Sigurd and Gudrún]]'', which was released worldwide on 5 May 2009 by HarperCollins and Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, retells the legend of [[Sigurd]] and the fall of the [[Niflungs]] from Germanic mythology. It is a [[narrative poem]] composed in [[alliterative verse]] and is modelled after the [[Old Norse]] poetry of the [[Elder Edda]]. Christopher Tolkien supplied copious notes and commentary upon his father's work.\n\nAccording to Christopher Tolkien, it is no longer possible to trace the exact date of the work's composition. On the basis of circumstantial evidence, he suggests that it dates from the 1930s. In his foreword he wrote, \"He scarcely ever (to my knowledge) referred to them. For my part, I cannot recall any conversation with him on the subject until very near the end of his life, when he spoke of them to me, and tried unsuccessfully to find them.\"<ref>''The Legend of Sigurd and Gudrún'', page 5.</ref> In a 1967 letter to [[W.

The most developed of these are [[Quenya]] and [[Sindarin]], the etymological connection between which formed the core of much of Tolkien's ''legendarium''. Language and grammar for Tolkien was a matter of [[aesthetics]] and [[euphony]], and Quenya in particular was designed from \"phonaesthetic\" considerations; it was intended as an \"Elvenlatin\", and was phonologically based on Latin, with ingredients from Finnish, Welsh, English, and Greek.<ref name=\"letter144\">''Letters'', no. 144.</ref> A notable addition came in late 1945 with [[Adûnaic]] or [[Númenórean]], a language of a \"faintly [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] flavour\", connected with Tolkien's [[Atlantis]] legend, which by ''[[The Notion Club Papers]]'' ties directly into his ideas about the inability of language to be inherited, and via the \"[[Second Age]]\" and the story of [[Eärendil]] was grounded in the ''legendarium'', thereby providing a link of Tolkien's 20th-century \"real primary world\" with the legendary past of his Middle-earth.\n\nTolkien considered languages inseparable from the mythology associated with them, and he consequently took a dim view of [[International auxiliary language|auxiliary languages]]: in 1930 a congress of Esperantists were told as much by him, in his lecture ''[[A Secret Vice]]'',<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.bl.uk/european/2018/01/tolkiens-secret-vice.html|title=Tolkien's 'Secret Vice'|last=Corsetti|first=Renato|date=31 January 2018|website=British Library}}</ref> \"Your language construction will breed a mythology\", but by 1956 he had concluded that \"[[Volapük]], [[Esperanto]], [[Ido (language)|Ido]], [[Novial]], &c, &c, are dead, far deader than ancient unused languages, because their authors never invented any Esperanto legends\".<ref name=\"letter180\">''Letters'', no. 180.</ref>\n\nThe popularity of Tolkien's books has had a small but lasting effect on the use of language in fantasy literature in particular, and even on mainstream dictionaries, which today commonly accept Tolkien's idiosyncratic spellings ''dwarves'' and ''dwarvish'' (alongside ''dwarfs'' and ''dwarfish''), which had been little used since the mid-19th century and earlier. (In fact, according to Tolkien, had the [[Old English]] plural survived, it would have been ''dwarrows'' or ''dwerrows''.) He also coined the term ''[[eucatastrophe]]'', though it remains mainly used in connection with his own work.\n\n== Artwork ==\n{{Expand section|date=May 2018}}\nHe was an accomplished artist, who learned to paint and draw as a child and continued to do so all his life.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.connexionfrance.com/Mag/Big-Picture/The-fine-art-of-weaving-a-Tolkien-tale|title=The fine art of weaving a Tolkien tale|last=France|first=Connexion|website=www.connexionfrance.com|access-date=7 March 2018}}</ref> From early in his writing career, the development of his stories was accompanied by drawings and paintings, especially of landscapes, and by maps of the lands in which the tales were set. He also produced pictures to accompany the stories told to his own children, including those later published in ''Mr Bliss'' and ''Roverandom'', and sent them elaborately illustrated letters purporting to come from Father Christmas. Although he regarded himself as an amateur, the publisher used the author's own cover art, maps, and full-page illustrations for the early editions of ''The Hobbit''. Much of his artwork was collected and published in 1995 as a book: ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien: Artist and Illustrator]]''. The book discusses the paintings, drawings, and sketches of J.R.R.

Personally known to him were [[Pauline Baynes]] (Tolkien's favourite illustrator of ''[[The Adventures of Tom Bombadil]]'' and ''[[Farmer Giles of Ham]]'') and [[Donald Swann]] (who set the music to ''[[The Road Goes Ever On]]''). Queen [[Margrethe II of Denmark]] created illustrations to ''The Lord of the Rings'' in the early 1970s.

In 1946, he rejected suggestions for illustrations by Horus Engels for the German edition of ''The Hobbit'' as \"too [[The Walt Disney Company|Disnified]] ... Bilbo with a dribbling nose, and [[Gandalf]] as a figure of vulgar fun rather than the [[Odin]]ic wanderer that I think of\".<ref>''Letters'', no. 107.</ref>\n\nTolkien was sceptical of the emerging [[Tolkien fandom]] in the United States, and in 1954 he returned proposals for the dust jackets of the American edition of ''The Lord of the Rings'':\n{{quote|Thank you for sending me the projected \"blurbs\", which I return. The Americans are not as a rule at all amenable to criticism or correction; but I think their effort is so poor that I feel constrained to make some effort to improve it.<ref name=\"letter144\"/>}}\n\nHe had dismissed dramatic representations of fantasy in his essay \"[[On Fairy-Stories]]\", first presented in 1939:\n{{quote|In human art Fantasy is a thing best left to words, to true literature. ...

He was not implacably opposed to the idea of a dramatic adaptation, however, and sold the film, stage and merchandise rights of ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Lord of the Rings'' to [[United Artists]] in 1968. United Artists never made a film, although director [[John Boorman]] was planning a live-action film in the early 1970s.
