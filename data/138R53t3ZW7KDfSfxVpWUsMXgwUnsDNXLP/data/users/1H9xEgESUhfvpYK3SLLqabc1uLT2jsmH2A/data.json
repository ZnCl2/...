By using the [ContentFilter plugin](/Blog.ZeroNetwork.bit/?Post:131), sites and users included in these lists will be blocked from your zeronet client. These lists are maintained by the individuals who create them so update frequency may vary dramatically from list to list. Simply visiting a blocklist is not sufficient to enable the blocking feature. One must Enable or Subscribe to that list by ticking the button found on that page. When the owner of the list adds a new entry, that site will update your local site and your list of blocked users will be updated accordingly.\n\n__BE ADVISED__ that subscribing to a blocklist is granting great trust into the site owner as they have the ability to block sites and users for a non descriptive purpose and an unaware user would never become aware of the incident unless they unsubscribe from the list themselves.\n\n__Alternatively__: if you do not want to use a blocklist but would still want to block or mute a problematic user, you can read the [[mute]] section to learn about other methods of doing so.\n\nThis list has been updated on: `Apr 11, 2020)`\n\nSite | Type | Creator \n --- |:---:| --- |\n[1CufK1ZtvekbFXEpSyKT2gDjf9jnqW8KwG](/1CufK1ZtvekbFXEpSyKT2gDjf9jnqW8KwG/) | Spammers and CP | kaffie\n[13CgSQeywg2ius5pjXVCk7dKUCRkz5xvW3](/13CgSQeywg2ius5pjXVCk7dKUCRkz5xvW3) | Pornography | ssdifnskdjfnsdjk\n[1LgqZfbtr6dukbjHdjWBEmmthq1shEv3y1](/1LgqZfbtr6dukbjHdjWBEmmthq1shEv3y1) | MOAB/nopelist | styromaniac \n[18zoKfKYPnVBuHtKpK1mhAuVsWXV72obA1](/18zoKfKYPnVBuHtKpK1mhAuVsWXV72obA1/) | Privacy | null \n[12qMBf8fJikRuAQ4wwCQHuBY7FeQBSwskH](/12qMBf8fJikRuAQ4wwCQHuBY7FeQBSwskH/) | Untrusted sites | oncatcoaster \n[1HnyzU52qiJBW4LxHHzDJHiTceWrqMhh69](/1HnyzU52qiJBW4LxHHzDJHiTceWrqMhh69/) | untrusted blocklist | Balancer \n[1NominErMMEodukCTKD5NN6HqgmtsG4Z8U](/1NominErMMEodukCTKD5NN6HqgmtsG4Z8U/) | NoMiner | thunder33345 \n[15YAjM8A97RuJCdSNSNbsJKv1z9biRk9ne](/15YAjM8A97RuJCdSNSNbsJKv1z9biRk9ne/) | Chinese Spammers | null \n[1FiLTerEAHp7UT8Aw2zQBypcm5T14kgZDa](/1FiLTerEAHp7UT8Aw2zQBypcm5T14kgZDa) | cloneable template | nofish \n[1GTVetvjTEriCMzKzWSP9FahYoMPy6BG1P](/1GTVetvjTEriCMzKzWSP9FahYoMPy6BG1P/?/blocklist/license-offenders) | Sites in violation of FOSS licenses. | Krixano \n[1CrsB58YZQ1BRECZy9C6AjbuN53TJQ59ys](/1CrsB58YZQ1BRECZy9C6AjbuN53TJQ59ys/) |Illegal sites and users.
