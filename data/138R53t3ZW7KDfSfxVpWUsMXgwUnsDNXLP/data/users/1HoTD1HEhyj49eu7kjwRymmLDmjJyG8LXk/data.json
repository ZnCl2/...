			"body": "ZeroNet is a decentralized Internet-like network of peer-to-peer users. It is based in Budapest, Hungary; is built in Python; and fully open source. Sites have specific \"ZeroNet URL\"s which can be accessed through an ordinary web browser when using the ZeroNet application, which acts as a local webhost for such pages. ZeroNet is not anonymous by default, but users can hide their IP address by using the built in Tor-functionality. ZeroNet uses bitcoin cryptography and the BitTorrent network. The BitTorrent website Play hosts a magnet link repository on ZeroNet, which links to copyrighted content. There is a Reddit community which offers support for ZeroNet.\n\nA wiki is a website that provides collaborative modification of its content and structure directly from the web browser. In a typical wiki, text is written using a simplified markup language (known as \"wiki markup\") and often edited with the help of a rich-text editor. A wiki is run using wiki software, otherwise known as a wiki engine. There are dozens of different wiki engines in use, both standalone and part of other software, such as bug tracking systems. The online encyclopedia project Wikipedia is by far the most popular wiki-based website, and is in fact one of the most widely viewed sites of any kind in the world, having been ranked in the top ten since 2007.\n\nThis text is copy pasted from en.wikipedia.org",
