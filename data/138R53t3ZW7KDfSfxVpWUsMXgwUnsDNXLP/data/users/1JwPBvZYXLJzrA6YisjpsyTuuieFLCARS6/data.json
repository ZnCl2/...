			"body": "# Cloning\n\nCloning is the act of making a clone of a [[Zite]]. \n\nThis can be achieved by going to [[ZeroHello]] ([[ZeroNet]]'s home page, and your home page), hovering over the site you want to clone, clicking on the 3 dots at the right and selecting \"`clone`\".\n\nMost users get familiar with this when they first clone [ZeroBlog](http://127.0.0.1:43110/Blog.ZeroNetwork.bit), a [[ZeroNet]] powered blog.\n\n## Enable cloning on your [[zite]]\n\nYou may have noticed the \"`clone`\" option is not there for every website. The website owner has to enable this in the site's [[content.json]] by setting the boolean \"`cloneable`\" to \"`true`\", then [[signing]] and [[publishing]] it.\n\n## *-default files\n\nFiles with `-default` suffix will be copied instead of their equivalent without this suffix. For example, if their are both a `data` and a `data-default` directory in the zite, only the `data-default` will be copied. It's commonly used to avoid having a lot of useless data being copied, like articles in [ZeroBlog](http://127.0.0.1:43110/Blog.ZeroNetwork.bit).",

However, there's no notice of which links point where without examining the target URL (which may not be possible or enabled in some browsers). Personally, I think there should be either an automatic marker for clearnet sites, or a notice on the article to alert users of what links leave ZeroNet. It's also worth noting that in the future, some users may be accessing ZeroNet without access to the traditional internet/web, making these essentially dead links. Thoughts?\n\n*Thought*: I think we need to specify where the link will take the user, like **Bitcoin on the English Wikipedia**. That should be enough to explain what's going on. Also, the user can see the link if they hover it. ***muja@zeroid.bit***\n\n*second thought*: clear phrasing is important, but it migth be better to use a simple icon to indicate clearnet sites. Something like a paperclip or Wikipedia's boxes-with-an-arrow icon would work. Here's more info: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:External_link_icons  \nUsing a different color might work too (e.g. a slightly lighter shade of blue), but not all monitors will be able display the difference.\n\n*Third thought*: We really have three types of pages that articles can link to: other zerowiki articles, pages on other zites, and clearnet pages. That makes for two kinds of external links, the second one being 'more' external. We may or may not want to have different ways of handling those two.\n\nGood points. I think both would help a lot but since there are three *kinds* of links, different colors would look better than different arrows.  ***muja@zeroid.bit***\n\nMaybe a (red/yellow/green depending on the target) dot near the link?\n\n*Somewhat related thought*: Regarding the dead kinks issue, someone could create an archive zite with optional files (like web.archive.org).\n\n*Issue with coloring*: Some users in the future may be able to get a theme for ZeroNet, and all links may be the same color in that theme. ***scrub@zeroid.bit***\n\n*Random developer*: I wrote a pull request (https://github.com/ZeroNetLabs/ZeroWiki/pull/4) that has been merge in june 2016 that make external links (and clearnet links) distinguishable from internal wiki links. So all this issue is theorically implemented. We now just have to wait that the owner of this wiki apply the update. \n\n----\n\n### To Link Is To Do\n\nThere's a problem with ZeroNet links because the host part http://host:port differs a lot from client to client and especially for proxies:\n\nTry a link via 127.0.0.1:43110 using a proxy or with a different port number in your local setup... it'll fail...\n\n* [Official zite](http://127.0.0.1:43110/search.kaffie.bit/) [📎](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1Mr5rX9TauvaGReB4RjCaE6D37FJQaY5Ba)\n\n```\n* [Official zite](http://127.0.0.1:43110/search.kaffie.bit/) [📎](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1Mr5rX9TauvaGReB4RjCaE6D37FJQaY5Ba)\n```\n\nLink without HOST part works with proxies too:\n\n* [Official zite](/search.kaffie.bit/) [📎](/1Mr5rX9TauvaGReB4RjCaE6D37FJQaY5Ba)\n\n```\n* [Official zite](/search.kaffie.bit/) [📎](/1Mr5rX9TauvaGReB4RjCaE6D37FJQaY5Ba)\n```\n\n...seen something like that @ Himalaya...\n\n...bye² from Alfie...\n\n----\n\n-> but there is afaik an addon, that makes urls like http://search.kaffie.bit usable … that would probably break it, not sure so.

Something like a paperclip or Wikipedia's boxes-with-an-arrow icon would work. Here's more info: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:External_link_icons  \nUsing a different color might work too (e.g. a slightly lighter shade of blue), but not all monitors will be able display the difference.\n\n*Third thought*: We really have three types of pages that articles can link to: other zerowiki articles, pages on other zites, and clearnet pages. That makes for two kinds of external links, the second one being 'more' external. We may or may not want to have different ways of handling those two.\n\nGood points. I think both would help a lot but since there are three *kinds* of links, different colors would look better than different arrows.  ***muja@zeroid.bit***\n\nMaybe a (red/yellow/green depending on the target) dot near the link?\n\n*Somewhat related thought*: Regarding the dead kinks issue, someone could create an archive zite with optional files (like web.archive.org).\n\n*Issue with coloring*: Some users in the future may be able to get a theme for ZeroNet, and all links may be the same color in that theme. ***scrub@zeroid.bit***\n\n*Random developer*: I wrote a [https://github.com/ZeroNetLabs/ZeroWiki/pull/4](pull request) that has been merge in june 2016 that make external links (and clearnet links) distinguishable from internal wiki links. So all this issue is theorically implemented. We now just have to wait that the owner of this wiki apply the update. \n\n----\n\n### To Link Is To Do\n\nThere's a problem with ZeroNet links because the host part http://host:port differs a lot from client to client and especially for proxies:\n\nTry a link via 127.0.0.1:43110 using a proxy or with a different port number in your local setup... it'll fail...\n\n* [Official zite](http://127.0.0.1:43110/search.kaffie.bit/) [📎](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1Mr5rX9TauvaGReB4RjCaE6D37FJQaY5Ba)\n\n```\n* [Official zite](http://127.0.0.1:43110/search.kaffie.bit/) [📎](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1Mr5rX9TauvaGReB4RjCaE6D37FJQaY5Ba)\n```\n\nLink without HOST part works with proxies too:\n\n* [Official zite](/search.kaffie.bit/) [📎](/1Mr5rX9TauvaGReB4RjCaE6D37FJQaY5Ba)\n\n```\n* [Official zite](/search.kaffie.bit/) [📎](/1Mr5rX9TauvaGReB4RjCaE6D37FJQaY5Ba)\n```\n\n...seen something like that @ Himalaya...\n\n...bye² from Alfie...\n\n----\n\n-> but there is afaik an addon, that makes urls like http://search.kaffie.bit usable … that would probably break it, not sure so. But agree, relative paths would be better.\n\n----\n\nUsing 127.0.0.1-Links force you to use a local client.\nProxies soon will be a common entry point to ZeroNet.\nStripping http://host:port so kinda getting an absolute path relative to current host and port work best for me...\n\n-- *yeti 20160314-1933-GMT*.\n\n----\n\nThere definitely needs to be a standardized way of linking to ZeroNet sites. Relative linking works, but it indeed absolutely breaks the chrome extension. The other option is to simply build the URL depending on what the visitor's current URL is. It's not a simple 'a' tag and requires a bit of javascript magic, but certainly works. Kaffiene does something like this.\n\n---\n\nI'm not sure, but I think zeronet automatically replaces the host:port part. See the links on http://127.0.0.1:43110/main.0rc.bit , which are automatically translated to 0net://sitename.bit and then back to the correct url.\n\n---\n\nMaybe put `zero://<link>` instead of `http://<link>`, add a method to the Zero API to get the base (either `localhost:43110`, or any other). Let a JS script run on every page that translates `zero://` links to the good link ?\n\n> *KindlyFire 13/06/16*\n\n---\n\n### Categories\n\nWe eventually will need a 'categories' box at the bottom of each page, where each category links to articles under that same category. Here are some possible categories: existing features (the follow button, optional files, cloning), planned features (merger sites, ipv6 support), specific sites, search engines, related projects (twister, i2p, tor, cjdns). Markdown's 'References' feature may be of use here.",
