Unlike [[SQL]] queries executed in a traditional [[RDBMS]], which return a result and exit, [[SQL]] queries executed in a [[RDSMS]] do not exit, generating results continuously as new data become available. Continuous [[SQL]] queries in a [[RDSMS]] use the [[SQL]] Window function to analyse, join and aggregate data streams over fixed or sliding windows. Windows can be specified as time-based or row-based. ",
