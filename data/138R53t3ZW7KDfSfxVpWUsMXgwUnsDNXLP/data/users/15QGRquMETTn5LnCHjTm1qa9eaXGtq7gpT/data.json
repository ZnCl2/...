			"body": "Tor\n===\n\nWhat is in Tor?\n---\nTor is a service that helps you to protect your anonymity while using the Internet. Tor is comprised of two parts: software you can download that allows you to use the Internet anonymously, and the volunteer network of computers that makes it possible for that software to work.\n\nWho created the Tor network?\n---\nThe core principle of Tor, \"onion routing\", was developed in the mid-1990s by United States Naval Research Laboratory employees, mathematician Paul Syverson and computer scientists Michael Reed and David Goldschlag, with the purpose of protecting U.S. intelligence communications online.\n\nNowadays the software is maintained by the [Tor Project](https://torproject.org) and has stemmed into several child projects based on it, such as the TorBrowser, Orbot (Tor for Android) and others.\n\nIs it illegal to use the Tor Browser?\n---\nUsing Tor to browse the Internet is not illegal. \nHiding your IP address and browsing history is not illegal in and of itself. \n\nHowever, don't forget that the concept of legality varies according to the laws of a given place. The above is true for the United States, and probably for most of Europe and South America as well, but might be different for your country.\n\nHow do you connect to the Web through the Tor network?\n---\nThe simplest way is using the Tor Browser Bundle which contains all the required tools. To install it, go to www.torproject.org and download the appropriate file for your operating system. (Check the pgp signature of the downloaded file.) Run the downloaded file, choose an extraction location, then open the folder and click Start Tor Browser. ",

The user Alice Smith might be posting in a forum under the username PokemonFan92, her posts are all tied to that specific username, but not to her real name Alice Smith.\n\nLastly, do not confuse pseudonymity with privacy: with privacy, people know who you are, but they don't know what you do. Pseudonimity lets people know what you do, but not who you are. Pseudonymity is closer to anonymity in that sense.",
