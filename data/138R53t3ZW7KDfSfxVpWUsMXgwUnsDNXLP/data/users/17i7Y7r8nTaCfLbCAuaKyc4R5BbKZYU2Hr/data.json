However, there's no notice of which links point where without examining the target URL (which may not be possible or enabled in some browsers). Personally, I think there should be either an automatic marker for clearnet sites, or a notice on the article to alert users of what links leave ZeroNet. It's also worth noting that in the future, some users may be accessing ZeroNet without access to the traditional internet/web, making these essentially dead links. Thoughts?\n\n*Thought*: I think we need to specify where the link will take the user, like **Bitcoin on the English Wikipedia**. That should be enough to explain what's going on. Also, the user can see the link if they hover it. ***muja@zeroid.bit***\n\n*second thought*: clear phrasing is important, but it migth be better to use a simple icon to indicate clearnet sites. Something like a paperclip or Wikipedia's boxes-with-an-arrow icon would work. Here's more info: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:External_link_icons  \nUsing a different color might work too (e.g. a slightly lighter shade of blue), but not all monitors will be able display the difference.\n\n*Third thought*: We really have three types of pages that articles can link to: other zerowiki articles, pages on other zites, and clearnet pages. That makes for two kinds of external links, the second one being 'more' external. We may or may not want to have different ways of handling those two.\n\nGood points. I think both would help a lot but since there are three *kinds* of links, different colors would look better than different arrows.  ***muja@zeroid.bit***\n\n----\n\n### To Link Is To Do\n\nThere's a problem with ZeroNet links because the host part http://host:port differs a lot from client to client and especially for proxies:\n\nTry a link via 127.0.0.1:43110 using a proxy or with a different port number in your local setup... it'll fail...\n\n* [Official zite](http://127.0.0.1:43110/search.kaffie.bit/) [📎](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1Mr5rX9TauvaGReB4RjCaE6D37FJQaY5Ba)\n\n```\n* [Official zite](http://127.0.0.1:43110/search.kaffie.bit/) [📎](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1Mr5rX9TauvaGReB4RjCaE6D37FJQaY5Ba)\n```\n\nLink without HOST part works with proxies too:\n\n* [Official zite](/search.kaffie.bit/) [📎](/1Mr5rX9TauvaGReB4RjCaE6D37FJQaY5Ba)\n\n```\n* [Official zite](/search.kaffie.bit/) [📎](/1Mr5rX9TauvaGReB4RjCaE6D37FJQaY5Ba)\n```\n\n...seen something like that @ Himalaya...\n\n...bye² from Alfie...\n\n----\n\n-> but there is afaik an addon, that makes urls like http://search.kaffie.bit usable … that would probably break it, not sure so. But agree, relative paths would be better.\n\n----\n\nUsing 127.0.0.1-Links force you to use a local client.\nProxies soon will be a common entry point to ZeroNet.\nStripping http://host:port so kinda getting an absolute path relative to current host and port work best for me...\n\n-- *yeti 20160314-1933-GMT*.\n\n----\n\nThere definitely needs to be a standardized way of linking to ZeroNet sites. Relative linking works, but it indeed absolutely breaks the chrome extension. The other option is to simply build the URL depending on what the visitor's current URL is. It's not a simple 'a' tag and requires a bit of javascript magic, but certainly works. Kaffiene does something like this.\n\n---\n\n### Categories\n\nWe eventually will need a 'categories' box at the bottom of each page, where each category links to articles under that same category. Here are some possible categories: existing features (the follow button, optional files, cloning), planned features (merger sites, ipv6 support), specific sites, search engines, related projects (twister, i2p, tor, cjdns). Markdown's 'References' feature may be of use here.",

Here's more info: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:External_link_icons  \nUsing a different color might work too (e.g. a slightly lighter shade of blue), but not all monitors will be able display the difference.\n\n*Third thought*: We really have three types of pages that articles can link to: other zerowiki articles, pages on other zites, and clearnet pages. That makes for two kinds of external links, the second one being 'more' external. We may or may not want to have different ways of handling those two.\n\nGood points. I think both would help a lot but since there are three *kinds* of external links, different colors would look better than different arrows.  ***muja@zeroid.bit***\n\n----\n\n### To Link Is To Do\n\nThere's a problem with ZeroNet links because the host part http://host:port differs a lot from client to client and especially for proxies:\n\nTry a link via 127.0.0.1:43110 using a proxy or with a different port number in your local setup... it'll fail...\n\n* [Official zite](http://127.0.0.1:43110/search.kaffie.bit/) [📎](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1Mr5rX9TauvaGReB4RjCaE6D37FJQaY5Ba)\n\n```\n* [Official zite](http://127.0.0.1:43110/search.kaffie.bit/) [📎](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1Mr5rX9TauvaGReB4RjCaE6D37FJQaY5Ba)\n```\n\nLink without HOST part works with proxies too:\n\n* [Official zite](/search.kaffie.bit/) [📎](/1Mr5rX9TauvaGReB4RjCaE6D37FJQaY5Ba)\n\n```\n* [Official zite](/search.kaffie.bit/) [📎](/1Mr5rX9TauvaGReB4RjCaE6D37FJQaY5Ba)\n```\n\n...seen something like that @ Himalaya...\n\n...bye² from Alfie...\n\n----\n\n-> but there is afaik an addon, that makes urls like http://search.kaffie.bit usable … that would probably break it, not sure so. But agree, relative paths would be better.\n\n----\n\nUsing 127.0.0.1-Links force you to use a local client.\nProxies soon will be a common entry point to ZeroNet.\nStripping http://host:port so kinda getting an absolute path relative to current host and port work best for me...\n\n-- *yeti 20160314-1933-GMT*.\n\n----\n\nThere definitely needs to be a standardized way of linking to ZeroNet sites. Relative linking works, but it indeed absolutely breaks the chrome extension. The other option is to simply build the URL depending on what the visitor's current URL is. It's not a simple 'a' tag and requires a bit of javascript magic, but certainly works. Kaffiene does something like this.\n\n---\n\n### Categories\n\nWe eventually will need a 'categories' box at the bottom of each page, where each category links to articles under that same category. Here are some possible categories: existing features (the follow button, optional files, cloning), planned features (merger sites, ipv6 support), specific sites, search engines, related projects (twister, i2p, tor, cjdns). Markdown's 'References' feature may be of use here.",

[[Nodes]] in the IPFS network form a distributed file system. IPFS is an [[open source]] project developed by Protocol Labs with help from the open source community. It was initially designed by Juan Benet.\n\nIPFS seeks to connect all computing devices with the same system of files. In some ways, IPFS is similar to the Web, but IPFS could be seen as a single [[BitTorrent swarm]], exchanging objects within one [[Git]] repository. In other words, IPFS provides a high throughput content-addressed block storage model, with content-addressed hyperlinks. This forms a generalized Merkle DAG. IPFS combines a distributed hashtable, an incentivized block exchange, and a self-certifying namespace. IPFS has no single point of failure, and nodes do not need to trust each other.\n\nThe file system can be accessed in a variety of ways, including via FUSE and over HTTP. A local file can be added to the IPFS filesystem, making it available to the world. Files are identified by their [[hashes]], so it's caching-friendly.

Zeronet uses [[Bitcoin]] [[cryptography]] and the [[BitTorrent]] network.\n\nUsers can publish static or dynamic websites into ZeroNet and visitors automatically serve the visited website from their computer, with the option to stop serving the website at any time by either pausing or deleting it. Sites will remain online even if it is being served by only one [[peer]].\n\nWhen changes are published by the site owner, connected [[nodes]] serving that site (previous visitors) will receive the updates done to the site's content.\n\nZeroNet comes with a built-in [[SQL]] database. This makes content-heavy site development easy. The database is also synced with hosting nodes.\n\nThe existence of peer-to-peer online web-sites had been hypothesised for some time, with [[The Pirate Bay]] suggesting they would build such network, as well as [[BitTorrent Inc.]] which created the closed source [[Project Maelstrom]].
