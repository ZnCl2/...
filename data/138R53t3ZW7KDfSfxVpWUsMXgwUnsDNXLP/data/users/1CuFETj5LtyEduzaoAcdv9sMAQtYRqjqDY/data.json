A few examples why it's hard to sarcasm or snark the copyright cult:\n\n**\"I say to you that the VCR is to the American film producer and the American public as the Boston strangler is to the woman home alone.\"**\n- Jack Valenti, MPAA CEO.\n\n**\"Actually, Sonny wanted the term of copyright protection to last forever. I am informed by staff that such a change would violate the Constitution. ... As you know, there is also [then-MPAA president] Jack Valenti's proposal for term to last forever less one day. Perhaps the Committee may look at that next Congress.\"**\n- Mary Bono, Sonny Bono's widow.\n\n**\"We are sending our kids to very dangerous online neighborhoods — the pirates are not good guys. These aren’t roguish, basement-dwelling computer geeks — these are the same type of people that sell heroin.”**\n- Australian movie co-chief Graham Burke of Village Roa\n\n**“Pirates are part of organized criminal groups: some groups record videos in movie theaters, while others translate and dub films. Others still adapt and publish content online. Only criminal prosecution combined with tighter anti-piracy legislation can reduce the number of people engaging in this type of illegal business.”**\n - Andrey Busargin, Director of Brand Protection and Anti-Piracy at Singapore-based Group-IB",

			"body": "# Muting / Blocking a user\nZeronet offers a many ways of muting a problematic user or website. While Zeronet is a network that promotes the freedom of speech and the preservation of it, you as a Zeronet user have a decision to not be receptive of it. For this reason Zeronet offers a range of methods to mute or block problematic users.\n\n## ZeroTalk:\nTo mute a user on ZeroTalk, Go to the actual ZeroTalk zite, hover your cursor next to their name, and you should see three black dots. Click the dots, click \"mute this user\"\n\n## ZeroMe:\nIn ZeroMe, visit the user's profile page, at the left is a button for muting. \n\n## Global Mutes:\nAll of these methods of muting or blocking a user is done so by going to that user's ID provider such as [ZeroID.bit](/zeroid.bit) and click on (search in user database), this will allow you to enter the user's name into the text field. If the text above the button says 'found' you can then go on to click the 'Mute this User' button. \n\nOn some older zeronet instances, there may be a second confirmation dialog will appear in the top right that will ask \"Hide all content from....\" in which you will need to click the yellow 'Mute' button to confirm the action.\n\nAdditionally, there is a video demonstration of the user block and the effect it has on a video platform to block adult material, which can be found on the zeronet [KopyKate Video site](/big.kopykate.bit/?Video=1515834496_1J58Rie679DVSuKB1iDyFFTbzmaMaY2bt2).\n\n## Removing a  mute:\nOne can remove the mute by clicking on the three vertical dots on the [ZeroHello](/1HeLLo4uzjaLetFx6NH3PMwFP3qbRbTf3D/) page to get a menu. Click on \"manage blocked users and sites\". Click on the \"X\" beside their names. \n\nUsers or sites that have been added to a blocklist can only be removed by the site owner.\n\n## Blocklists:\nBlocklists are special purpose zeronet sites that contain either users and / or zeronet sites. The sites and users included in these lists will be blocked from your zeronet client. These lists are maintained by the individuals who create them so update frequency may vary dramatically from list to list. Simply visiting a blocklist is not sufficient to enable the blocking feature. One must Enable or Subscribe to that list by ticking the button found on that page.\n\nWhen the owner of the list adds a new entry, that site will update your local site and your list of blocked users will be updated accordingly. \n\n__BE ADVISED__ that subscribing to a blocklist is granting great trust into the site owner as they have the ability to block sites and users for a non descriptive purpose and an unaware user would never become aware of the incident unless they unsubscribe from the list themselves.\n\n- A list of [[blocklists]]",

However, many renderers -- like Github's and Markdown Here -- support syntax highlighting. Which languages are supported and how those language names should be written will vary from renderer to renderer. Markdown Here supports highlighting for dozens of languages (and not-really-languages, like diffs and HTTP headers); to see the complete list, and how to write the language names, see the highlight.js demo page.\n```\nInline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.\n```\nInline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.\n\nBlocks of code are either fenced by lines with three back-ticks ```, or are indented with four spaces.

They are an easy way of adding tables to your email -- a task that would otherwise require copy-pasting from another application.\n```\nColons can be used to align columns.\n\n| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |\n| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|\n| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |\n| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |\n| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |\n\nThere must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.\nThe outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the \nraw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.\n\nMarkdown | Less | Pretty\n--- | --- | ---\n*Still* | `renders` | **nicely**\n1 | 2 | 3\n```\nColons can be used to align columns.\n\n| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |\n| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|\n| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |\n| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |\n| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |\n\nThere must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.\nThe outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the \nraw Markdown line up prettily.

Oh boy let's keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone. Oh, you can *put* **Markdown** into a blockquote. \n```\n> Blockquotes are very handy in email to emulate reply text.\n> This line is part of the same quote.\n\nQuote break.\n\n> This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. Oh boy let's keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone. Oh, you can *put* **Markdown** into a blockquote. \n\n## Inline HTML\nYou can also use raw HTML in your Markdown, and it'll mostly work pretty well.\n```\n<dl>\n  <dt>Definition list</dt>\n  <dd>Is something people use sometimes.</dd>\n\n  <dt>Markdown in HTML</dt>\n  <dd>Does *not* work **very** well.

You'll soon learn to get what you want. \"Markdown Toggle\" is your friend.\n\nHere are some things to try out:\n```\nHere's a line for us to start with.\n\nThis line is separated from the one above by two newlines, so it will be a *separate paragraph*.\n\nThis line is also a separate paragraph, but...\nThis line is only separated by a single newline, so it's a separate line in the *same paragraph*.\n```\nHere's a line for us to start with.\n\nThis line is separated from the one above by two newlines, so it will be a *separate paragraph*.\n\nThis line is also a separate paragraph, but...\nThis line is only separated by a single newline, so it's a separate line in the *same paragraph*.\n\n\n## External links\n* [Markdown Guide](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#headers)\n* [official website](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)\n* [wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)",

This means that if you share a small file such as a mp3, you may eventually come back later to find that your client is no longer seeding that file which causes you to reacquire it. This can prove problematic in instances where material is no longer available and lacks seeder. To prevent this, a user can 'Pin' a file to ensure that it does expire regardless of seed count or age.\n\nTo pin a file, a user must click the [FILES](/1HeLLo4uzjaLetFx6NH3PMwFP3qbRbTf3D/?Files) tab that is found on the [ZeroHello](/1HeLLo4uzjaLetFx6NH3PMwFP3qbRbTf3D) page, from there, a file (or multiple files) can be selected by clicking the left most area of each file. Once files are selected, clicking the PIN button at the top of the page will flag each selected file for preservation.\n\nA file can be identified as being Pinned by the 'pinned' identifier found to the right of the file name. To unpin a file follow the same procedure to pin a file. If there are no files seeded, there will be no files to select on the Files tab.",

With Debian Linux, \n\n`sudo usermod -a -G debian-tor [yourlinuxuser]`\n\n(be sure to replace [yourlinuxuser] appropriately.)\n - Logout/Login with your user to apply group changes\n\nTip: You can verify if your Tor setup is running correctly using\n`echo 'PROTOCOLINFO' | nc 127.0.0.1 9051`\n\n### Install Zeronet for Debian Linux,  [Source](https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/tree/py3#other-platforms-install-from-source)\n\n`sudo apt-get update`\n\n`wget https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet-linux/archive/dist-linux64/ZeroNet-py3-linux64.tar.gz`\n\n`tar xvpfz ZeroNet-py3-linux64.tar.gz`\n\t\n### Enable the Bootstrapper and UIPassword plugins and launch Zeronet\n\n`cd ZeroNet-linux-dist-linux64/`\n\n`cd core`\n\n`cd plugins`\n\n`mv disabled-UiPassword UiPassword`\n\n`mv disabled-Bootstrapper Bootstrapper`\n\n`cd ..`\n\n`cd ..`\n\n`nohup ./ZeroNet.sh --ui_ip '*' --ui_port 80 --ui_password mypassword`\n\n - Now you can close your terminal and open your browser to the ip address of your server to see the WebUI.\n\nNotes: \n(ui_ip tells the client to bind the UI to any ip)\n(ui_port) being set to 80 is the default port for your browser, you can change it but then you will need to specify the port with the address such as `http://ServerIP:43110` with 43110 being the identified port for the WebUI\n(ui_password) this is the password used for your WebUI\n\n## Happy ZeroBoxing!",

While this act demonstrated the developers negligent concern towards the security of users in general. it highlights that little consideration was given to the many instances that these browsers would often have stored credentials of family wide households.

[Source](https://www.linuxuprising.com/2018/10/how-to-install-and-use-tor-as-proxy-in.html)\n\n - Start by installing apt-transport-https, needed in order to use https repositories, and curl, to download the repository key:\n\n`sudo apt install apt-transport-https curl`\n\n - And then add the Tor repository (and its key) in Ubuntu using these commands:\n\n`sudo -i`\n\n`echo \"deb https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org/ $(lsb_release -cs) main\" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/tor.list`\n\n`curl https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org/A3C4F0F979CAA22CDBA8F512EE8CBC9E886DDD89.asc | gpg --import`\n\n`gpg --export A3C4F0F979CAA22CDBA8F512EE8CBC9E886DDD89 | apt-key add -`\n\n`apt update`\n\n`exit`\n\nFor Linux Mint, replace `$(lsb_release -cs)` in the first command with the Ubuntu version codename your Linux Mint version is based on. For Linux Mint 19 (and 19.x), use bionic, while for Linux Mint 18.x use xenial.\n\n - Now you can install Tor, tor-geoipdb (to be able to use country specific exit nodes), torsocks (a library to easily torify applications) and deb.torproject.org-keyring (a package that makes sure you have the latest repository signing key):\n\n`sudo apt install tor tor-geoipdb torsocks deb.torproject.org-keyring`\n\n### Prepare TOR to work with Zeronet,  [Source](https://zeronet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq/#how-to-use-zeronet-with-tor)\n\n - Open up your /etc/tor/torrc file with\n\n`sudo nano /etc/tor/torrc`\n\n - Remove the # character from lines `ControlPort 9051` and `CookieAuthentication 1` (line ~57)\n    \n - Restart tor, then add permission for yourself to read the auth cookie. With Debian Linux, \n\n`sudo usermod -a -G debian-tor [yourlinuxuser]`\n\n(be sure to replace [yourlinuxuser] appropriately.)\n - Logout/Login with your user to apply group changes\n\nTip: You can verify if your Tor setup is running correctly using\n`echo 'PROTOCOLINFO' | nc 127.0.0.1 9051`\n\n### Install Zeronet for Debian Linux,  [Source](https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/tree/py3#other-platforms-install-from-source)\n\n`sudo apt-get update`\n`wget https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet-linux/archive/dist-linux64/ZeroNet-py3-linux64.tar.gz`\n`tar xvpfz ZeroNet-py3-linux64.tar.gz`\n\t\n### Enable the Bootstrapper and UIPassword plugins and launch Zeronet\n\n`cd ZeroNet-linux-dist-linux64/`\n\n`cd core`\n\n`cd plugins`\n\n`mv disabled-UiPassword UiPassword`\n\n`mv disabled-Bootstrapper Bootstrapper`\n\n`cd ..`\n\n`cd ..`\n\n`nohup ./ZeroNet.sh --ui_ip '*' --ui_port 80 --ui_password mypassword`\n\n - Now you can close your terminal and open your browser to the ip address of your server to see the WebUI.\n\nNotes: \n(ui_ip tells the client to bind the UI to any ip)\n(ui_port) being set to 80 is the default port for your browser, you can change it but then you will need to specify the port with the address such as `http://ServerIP:43110` with 43110 being the identified port for the WebUI\n(ui_password) this is the password used for your WebUI\n\n## Happy ZeroBoxing!",
