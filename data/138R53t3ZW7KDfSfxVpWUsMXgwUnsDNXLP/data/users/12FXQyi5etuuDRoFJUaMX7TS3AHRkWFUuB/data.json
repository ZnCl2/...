			"body": "= Cloning ==\n\nCloning is the act of making a clone of a [[Zite]]. \n\nThis can be achieved by going to [[ZeroHello]] ([[ZeroNet]]'s home page, and your home page), hovering over the site you want to clone, clicking on the 3 dots at the right and selecting \"`clone`\".\n\nMost users get familiar with this when they first clone [ZeroBlog](http://127.0.0.1:43110/Blog.ZeroNetwork.bit), a [[ZeroNet]] powered blog.\n\n== Enable cloning on your [[zite]] ==\n\nYou may have noticed the \"`clone`\" option is not there for every website. The website owner has to enable this in the site's [[content.json]] by setting the boolean \"`cloneable`\" to \"`true`\", then [[signing]] and [[publishing]] it.\n\n== *-default files ==\n\nFiles with `-default` suffix will be copied instead of their equivalent without this suffix. For example, if their are both a `data` and a `data-default` directory in the zite, only the `data-default` will be copied. It's commonly used to avoid having a lot of useless data being copied, like articles in [ZeroBlog](http://127.0.0.1:43110/Blog.ZeroNetwork.bit).",
