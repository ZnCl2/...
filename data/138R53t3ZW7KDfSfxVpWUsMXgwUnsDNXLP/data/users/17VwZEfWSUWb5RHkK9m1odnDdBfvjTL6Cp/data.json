			"body": "# ZeroWiki Issues\n\n## Bugs\n+ [FIXED] Posting multiple internal links consecutively results in odd effects. [[zite]] , [[wiki]] , [[wiki]] , [[zite]]\n+ Don't work with special chars in page name (example - try to create page with _ char)\n+ [FIXED] None of the icons visible on Win8.1 + Chrome\n+ [FIXED] Opening ZeroWiki for the first time displays a huge number of messages \"This page has been updated. Do you want to load the changes?\"\n+[FIXED] è¿™æ˜¯é›¶ç½‘WIKI\n\nPlease report bugs in this section.\n\n## Feature Requests\nPlease add feature requests here.\n+ Page anchors\n### Localization\n* Localization for pages (example - we have [Help](?Help) page with default language (en) but if we add ?lang=$name you can get localized version)\n*  interface localization \n* bifurcation of the localizated pages, each page for each language, being on it's own, separated from the ZeroWiki English. It could be like what it done for ZeroTalk, each ZeroTalk has it's own page in it's own proper language.\n### Site management/moderation\n* protected pages\n* moderators\n### Editing\n* if 2 people editing page at the same time - show alert\n    * or refuse to apply the changes if something changed in the meantime, and force the user to merge the two versions (git-like)\n* Global 'recent changes' page\n    * With follow button for zerohello\n* highlight differences between versions when opening history (like Github)\n    * or at least add a way to view/compare the differences between the different versions in the history.   \n* upload content (images) but only as optional files\n* [DONE] creative commons license for easier (legal) modification of articles\n* anchor to elements (good for linking to citations)\n* citations\n* page anchors\n* code element\n* separate ZeroWiki: sites from normal sites\n* [DONE] support [ [wikisite|alternative naming] ]\n* Optional short user entered message for edits shown on the History page (edit summary)\n* Talk page for each wiki page to keep discussions about edits off the articles\n* More markdown elements support like quotes >, tables, etc\n* Preview before saving page edits \n* MarkDown help menu (like the one zeroblog uses)\n### Other\n* .bit domain\n* site search, with 'did you mean' style correction\n* User pages\n* Aggregate history page of all ZeroWiki page changes.\n\n----\n\n### To Link Is To Do\n\nThere's a problem with ZeroNet links because the host part http://host:port differs a lot from client to client and especially for proxies:\n\nTry a link via 127.0.0.1:43110 using a proxy or with a different port number in your local setup... it'll fail...\n\n* [Official zite](http://127.0.0.1:43110/search.kaffie.bit/) [ðŸ“Ž](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1Mr5rX9TauvaGReB4RjCaE6D37FJQaY5Ba)\n\n```\n* [Official zite](http://127.0.0.1:43110/search.kaffie.bit/) [ðŸ“Ž](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1Mr5rX9TauvaGReB4RjCaE6D37FJQaY5Ba)\n```\n\nLink without HOST part works with proxies too:\n\n* [Official zite](/search.kaffie.bit/) [ðŸ“Ž](/1Mr5rX9TauvaGReB4RjCaE6D37FJQaY5Ba)\n\n```\n* [Official zite](/search.kaffie.bit/) [ðŸ“Ž](/1Mr5rX9TauvaGReB4RjCaE6D37FJQaY5Ba)\n```\n\n...seen something like that @ Himalaya...\n\n...byeÂ² from Alfie...\n\n----\n\n-> but there is afaik an addon, that makes urls like http://search.kaffie.bit usable â€¦ that would probably break it, not sure so. But agree, relative paths would be better.\n\n----\n\nUsing 127.0.0.1-Links force you to use a local client.\nProxies soon will be a common entry point to ZeroNet.\nStripping http://host:port so kinda getting an absolute path relative to current host and port work best for me...\n\n-- *yeti 20160314-1933-GMT*.\n\n----\n\nThere definitely needs to be a standardized way of linking to ZeroNet sites. Relative linking works, but it indeed absolutely breaks the chrome extension. The other option is to simply build the URL depending on what the visitor's current URL is. It's not a simple 'a' tag and requires a bit of javascript magic, but certainly works. Kaffiene does something like this.\n\n---\n\nI'm not sure, but I think zeronet automatically replaces the host:port part. See the links on http://127.0.0.1:43110/main.0rc.bit , which are automatically translated to 0net://sitename.bit and then back to the correct url.\n\n---\n\nMaybe put `zero://<link>` instead of `http://<link>`, add a method to the Zero API to get the base (either `localhost:43110`, or any other). Let a JS script run on every page that translates `zero://` links to the good link ?\n\n> *KindlyFire 13/06/16*\n\n---\n\nKaffie found a ways to use `zero://` links. All is explained [here](http://127.0.0.1:43110/kaffie.bit/test.html?zp). What about using only this type of links ? It makes the parser really easier to write and make it configurable for each user, in its browser.\n\n> *Emeraude 08/11/2016*\n\n---\n\n### Categories\n\nWe eventually will need a 'categories' box at the bottom of each page, where each category links to articles under that same category. Here are some possible categories: existing features (the follow button, optional files, cloning), planned features (merger sites, ipv6 support), specific sites, search engines, related projects (twister, i2p, tor, cjdns). Markdown's 'References' feature may be of use here.",

Tor is comprised of two parts: software you can download that allows you to use the Internet anonymously, and the volunteer network of computers that makes it possible for that software to work.\n\nWho created the Tor network?\n---\nThe core principle of Tor, \"onion routing\", was developed in the mid-1990s by United States Naval Research Laboratory employees, mathematician Paul Syverson and computer scientists Michael Reed and David Goldschlag, with the purpose of protecting U.S. intelligence communications online.\n\nIs it illegal to use the Tor Browser?\n---\nUsing Tor to browse the Internet is not illegal. \nHiding your IP address and browsing history is not illegal in and of itself.\n\nHow do you connect to the Web through the Tor network?\n---\nThe simplest way is using the Tor Browser Bundle which contains all the required tools. To install it, go to www.torproject.org and download the appropriate file for your operating system. (Check the pgp signature of the downloaded file.) Run the downloaded file, choose an extraction location, then open the folder and click Start Tor Browser. ",

Open-source code is meant to be a collaborative effort, where programmers improve upon the source code and share the changes within the community.\n\nWhat is the use of open source technology?\n---\nOpen source software is software whose source code is available for modification or enhancement by anyone. \"Source code\" is the part of software that most computer users don't ever see; it's the code computer programmers can manipulate to change how a piece of softwareâ€”a \"program\" or \"application\"â€”works.\n\nWhat do you mean by open source operating system?\n---\nGenerically, open source refers to a program in which the source code is available to the general public for use and/or modification from its original design free of charge, i.e., open. Self-referentially, short for GNU's not UNIX, a UNIX-compatible software system developed by the Free Software Foundation (FSF).\n\nWhat is meant by free as in free beer?\n---\nThis concept means \"a gift to you that does not cost you to acquire.\" For example, all freeware, all malware, and all published open source software that you can download for no cost. If you did not pay for it but you have it, then it's free as in beer. Also called: Gratis.",
