Official ticker is ___XMR___, read more about other [[forked Monero coins]].\n\n---\n\n\n  # **Monero** is:\n\n===\n## -UNTRACEABLE\n\n`Unlike most of the digital coins, Monero uses a special technology called “ring signatures” which shuffles users’ public keys in order to eliminate the possibility to identify a particular user.`\n\n## -UNLINKABLE\n\n`Being a great feature, untreaceability doesn’t protect a receiver from defining his or her  balance through inspecting ingoing messages to the user’s public address. Therefore, Monero employs a specific protocol which generates multiple unique one-time addresses that can only be linked by the payment receiver and are unfeasable to be revealed through blockhain analysis.`\n\n## -SECURE\n\n`Like any other digital currency, Monero is cryptographically secured. Though, the peculiarity of algorithm consists in tremendous computational and electric capibilities that a hacker would need to even try to steal your funds.\nTo put it in a nutshell, your wallet is unbreakable.`\n\n## -PRIVATE\n\n`Besides other features, privacy is basically provided with the idea of anonymous transactions without any obligations to cooperate with third parties. Monero is based on cryptography that has lots of muddling factors in its arsenal, making it difficult to detect whom transactions belong.`\n\n## -ANALYSIS RESISTANT\n\n`Monero’s blockhain analysis resistantce results from unlinkability, which was achieved by using a modified version of the Diffie-Hellman exchange protocol that generates multiple one-time public addresses that can only be simply gathered by the message receiver, but hardly analyzed by confused foreigners inside the block explorer.is.`\n\n# ![Monero](https://monero.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/monero-to-the-moon.gif \"Monero (XMR)\")\n\n\n## External links\n\n[Monero](https://monero.org/) (clearnet)\n[Monero on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/) (clearnet)\n\n",

The funds are stored in wallets that are identified by a [[UUID]], and are encrypted with various encryption algorithms. Transactions are typically recorded by public network [[nodes]] and then distributed via [[peer-to-peer]] downloads in a ledger known as a [[blockchain]].\n\n**[[Bitcoin]]** is commonly referred to as the first cryptocurrency, although others existed before it. It was the first successful decentralized currency system, and the first to be widely publicized and used. \n\nSince Bitcoin's success, many other cryptocurrencies have been created with similar systems, such as [[Litecoin]], [[Dogecoin]], [[Namecoin]], [[Monero]] and countless others. \n\n# External Links\n\n[Top cryptocurrency market captializations](https://coinmarketcap.com/)",
