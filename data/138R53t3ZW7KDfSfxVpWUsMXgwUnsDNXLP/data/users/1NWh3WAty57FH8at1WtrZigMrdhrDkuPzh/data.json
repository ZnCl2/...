The term appeared in an FBI investigation report on the Hillary Clinton email controversy. Instead of following the State Department's usual procedure of rolling releases of FOIA documents, the group allegedly wanted to release them all in January of 2016. They were overruled by the State Department Office of Information Programs and Services (IPS).[1]\n\nThe documents include an interview with an unnamed individual, who suggested that Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests related to Clinton went through this alleged group: \"There was a powerful group of very high-ranking STATE officials that some referred to as \"The 7th Floor Group\" or \"The Shadow Government.\" This group met every Wednesday afternoon to discuss the FOIA process, Congressional records, and everything CLINTON-related to FOIA/Congressional inquiries,\" the FBI's interview summary said.\"[1]\n\n#References\n\n1 Rosenfeld, Everett (17 October 2016). \"New FBI release on Clinton email probe refers to 'Shadow Government'\".

[[Nodes]] in the IPFS network form a distributed file system. IPFS is an [[open source]] project developed by Protocol Labs with help from the open source community. It was initially designed by Juan Benet.\n\nIPFS seeks to connect all computing devices with the same system of files. In some ways, IPFS is similar to the Web, but IPFS could be seen as a single [[BitTorrent swarm]], exchanging objects within one [[Git]] repository. In other words, IPFS provides a high throughput content-addressed block storage model, with content-addressed hyperlinks. This forms a generalized Merkle DAG. IPFS combines a distributed hashtable, an incentivized block exchange, and a self-certifying namespace. IPFS has no single point of failure, and nodes do not need to trust each other.\n\nThe file system can be accessed in a variety of ways, including via FUSE and over HTTP. A local file can be added to the IPFS filesystem, making it available to the world. Files are identified by their [[hashes]], so it's caching-friendly. They are distributed using a Bittorrent-based protocol. Other users viewing the content aid in serving the content to others on the network. IPFS has a name service called IPNS, a global namespace based on PKI, serves to build trust chains, is compatible with other NSes and can map DNS, .onion, .bit, etc. to IPNS.\n\n## External Links\n* [Website](https://ipfs.io) (clearnet!)\n* [IPFS Introduction Video (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CMxDNuuAiQ) (clearnet!)\n* [HTTP is obsolete.

However, there's no notice of which links point where without examining the target URL (which may not be possible or enabled in some browsers). Personally, I think there should be either an automatic marker for clearnet sites, or a notice on the article to alert users of what links leave ZeroNet. It's also worth noting that in the future, some users may be accessing ZeroNet without access to the traditional internet/web, making these essentially dead links. Thoughts?\n\n----\n\n### To Link Is To Do\n\nThere's a problem with ZeroNet links because the host part http://host:port differs a lot from client to client and especially for proxies:\n\nTry a link via 127.0.0.1:43110 using a proxy or with a different port number in your local setup... it'll fail...\n\n* [Official zite](http://127.0.0.1:43110/search.kaffie.bit/) [📎](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1Mr5rX9TauvaGReB4RjCaE6D37FJQaY5Ba)\n\n```\n* [Official zite](http://127.0.0.1:43110/search.kaffie.bit/) [📎](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1Mr5rX9TauvaGReB4RjCaE6D37FJQaY5Ba)\n```\n\nLink without HOST part works with proxies too:\n\n* [Official zite](/search.kaffie.bit/) [📎](/1Mr5rX9TauvaGReB4RjCaE6D37FJQaY5Ba)\n\n```\n* [Official zite](/search.kaffie.bit/) [📎](/1Mr5rX9TauvaGReB4RjCaE6D37FJQaY5Ba)\n```\n\n...seen something like that @ Himalaya...\n\n...bye² from Alfie...\n\n----\n\n-> but there is afaik an addon, that makes urls like http://search.kaffie.bit usable … that would probably break it, not sure so. But agree, relative paths would be better.\n\n----\n\nUsing 127.0.0.1-Links force you to use a local client.\nProxies soon will be a common entry point to ZeroNet.\nStripping http://host:port so kinda getting an absolute path relative to current host and port work best for me...\n\n-- *yeti 20160314-1933-GMT*.\n\n----\n\nThere definitely needs to be a standardized way of linking to ZeroNet sites. Relative linking works, but it indeed absolutely breaks the chrome extension. The other option is to simply build the URL depending on what the visitor's current URL is. It's not a simple 'a' tag and requires a bit of javascript magic, but certainly works. Kaffiene does something like this.",
