			"body": "# InterPlanetary File System\n\n**InterPlanetary File System** (**IPFS**), is a content-addressable, [[peer-to-peer]] hypermedia distribution protocol. [[Nodes]] in the IPFS network form a distributed file system. IPFS is an [[open source]] project developed by Protocol Labs with help from the open source community. It was initially designed by Juan Benet.\n\nIPFS seeks to connect all computing devices with the same system of files. In some ways, IPFS is similar to the Web, but IPFS could be seen as a single [[BitTorrent swarm]], exchanging objects within one [[Git]] repository. In other words, IPFS provides a high throughput content-addressed block storage model, with content-addressed hyperlinks. This forms a generalized Merkle DAG. IPFS combines a distributed hashtable, an incentivized block exchange, and a self-certifying namespace. IPFS has no single point of failure, and nodes do not need to trust each other.\n\nThe file system can be accessed in a variety of ways, including via FUSE and over HTTP. A local file can be added to the IPFS filesystem, making it available to the world. Files are identified by their [[hashes]], so it's caching-friendly. They are distributed using Bitswap, a Bittorrent-like protocol. Other users viewing the content aid in serving the content to others on the network. IPFS has a name service called IPNS, a global namespace based on PKI, serves to build trust chains, is compatible with other NSes and can map DNS, .onion, .bit, etc. to IPNS.\n\n## External Links\n* [Website](https://ipfs.io) (clearnet!)\n* [IPFS Introduction Video (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CMxDNuuAiQ) (clearnet!)\n* [HTTP is obsolete.
