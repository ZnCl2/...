However, there's no notice of which links point where without examining the target URL (which may not be possible or enabled in some browsers). Personally, I think there should be either an automatic marker for clearnet sites, or a notice on the article to alert users of what links leave ZeroNet. It's also worth noting that in the future, some users may be accessing ZeroNet without access to the traditional internet/web, making these essentially dead links. Thoughts?\n\n*Thought*: I think we need to specify where the link will take the user, like **Bitcoin on the English Wikipedia**. That should be enough to explain what's going on. Also, the user can see the link if they hover it. ***muja@zeroid.bit***\n\n*second thought*: clear phrasing is important, but it migth be better to use a simple icon to indicate clearnet sites. Something like a paperclip or Wikipedia's boxes-with-an-arrow icon would work. Here's more info: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:External_link_icons  \nUsing a different color might work too (e.g. a slightly lighter shade of blue), but not all monitors will be able display the difference.\n\n*Third thought*: We really have three types of pages that articles can link to: other zerowiki articles, pages on other zites, and clearnet pages. That makes for two kinds of external links, the second one being 'more' external. We may or may not want to have different ways of handling those two.\n\nGood points. I think both would help a lot but since there are three *kinds* of links, different colors would look better than different arrows.  ***muja@zeroid.bit***\n\n----\n\n### To Link Is To Do\n\nThere's a problem with ZeroNet links because the host part http://host:port differs a lot from client to client and especially for proxies:\n\nTry a link via 127.0.0.1:43110 using a proxy or with a different port number in your local setup... it'll fail...\n\n* [Official zite](http://127.0.0.1:43110/search.kaffie.bit/) [ðŸ“Ž](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1Mr5rX9TauvaGReB4RjCaE6D37FJQaY5Ba)\n\n```\n* [Official zite](http://127.0.0.1:43110/search.kaffie.bit/) [ðŸ“Ž](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1Mr5rX9TauvaGReB4RjCaE6D37FJQaY5Ba)\n```\n\nLink without HOST part works with proxies too:\n\n* [Official zite](/search.kaffie.bit/) [ðŸ“Ž](/1Mr5rX9TauvaGReB4RjCaE6D37FJQaY5Ba)\n\n```\n* [Official zite](/search.kaffie.bit/) [ðŸ“Ž](/1Mr5rX9TauvaGReB4RjCaE6D37FJQaY5Ba)\n```\n\n...seen something like that @ Himalaya...\n\n...byeÂ² from Alfie...\n\n----\n\n-> but there is afaik an addon, that makes urls like http://search.kaffie.bit usable â€¦ that would probably break it, not sure so. But agree, relative paths would be better.\n\n----\n\nUsing 127.0.0.1-Links force you to use a local client.\nProxies soon will be a common entry point to ZeroNet.\nStripping http://host:port so kinda getting an absolute path relative to current host and port work best for me...\n\n-- *yeti 20160314-1933-GMT*.\n\n----\n\nThere definitely needs to be a standardized way of linking to ZeroNet sites. Relative linking works, but it indeed absolutely breaks the chrome extension. The other option is to simply build the URL depending on what the visitor's current URL is. It's not a simple 'a' tag and requires a bit of javascript magic, but certainly works. Kaffiene does something like this.\n\n---\n\n### Categories\n\nWe eventually will need a 'categories' box at the bottom of each page, where each category links to articles under that same category. Here are some possible categories: existing features (the follow button, optional files, cloning), planned features (merger sites, ipv6 support), specific sites, search engines, related projects (twister, i2p, tor, cjdns). Markdown's 'References' feature may be of use here.",

Feel free to click any link you see in the texts too, they will take you to magic places.\n\nBlue links will take you to existing pages which already have content and intersting things for you to read. On the other hand, red links will lead you to pages that do not exist yet, you will be able to add content and write some spells to create them.\n\nMost of the pages in this wiki are editable too! just look for the Edit button if you feel the urge to modify what you are reading. This is a collaborative tool for shared knowledge, improve the contents, show your kung-fu, and the community will be grateful forever with dances and songs to remember your feat.\n\n## Text editing\n\nThis wiki uses Markdown to format the texts, use it to add titles, to make your text bold or to add links to external resources.\n\nTo create links to new or existing pages in this wiki, just use double square brackets around words. The wiki will auto-magically convert it to wiki-links. It will also detect if the page already exists and use the corresponding color to display the link.\n\n### Final words\n\nNo, just kidding.
