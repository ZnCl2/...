			"body": "# ZeroNet\n\n**ZeroNet** is a [[decentralized]] network of [[peer-to-peer]] users. It is built in [[Python]] and fully [[open source]]. Sites have specific addresses which can be accessed through a browser when using its client. ZeroNet is not [[anonymous]] by default, but users can hide their IP address by using the built in [[Tor]]-functionality. ZeroNet uses elliptic curve [[cryptography]] and the [[BitTorrent]] network.\n\nUsers can publish static or dynamic websites into ZeroNet and visitors automatically serve the visited website from their computer, with the option to stop serving the website at any time by either pausing or deleting it. Sites will remain online even if it is being served by only one [[peer-to-peer|peer]].\n\nWhen changes are published by the site owner, connected [[nodes]] serving that site (previous visitors) will receive the updates done to the site's content.\n\nZeroNet comes with a built-in [[SQL]] [[database]]. This makes content-heavy site development easy. The [[database]] is also synced with hosting [[nodes]].\n\nThe existence of [[peer-to-peer]] online [[website]]s had been hypothesized for some time, with [[The Pirate Bay]] suggesting they would build such network, as well as [[BitTorrent Inc.]] which created the closed source [[Project Maelstrom]]. One other similar project is [[MaidSafe]], though it has not yet seen widespread use, and has been said to focus more on file storage.",
