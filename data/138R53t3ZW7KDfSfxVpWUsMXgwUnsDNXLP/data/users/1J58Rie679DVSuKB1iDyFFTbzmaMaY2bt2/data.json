However, many renderers -- like Github's and Markdown Here -- support syntax highlighting. Which languages are supported and how those language names should be written will vary from renderer to renderer. Markdown Here supports highlighting for dozens of languages (and not-really-languages, like diffs and HTTP headers); to see the complete list, and how to write the language names, see the highlight.js demo page.\n```\nInline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.\n```\nInline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.\n\nBlocks of code are either fenced by lines with three back-ticks ```, or are indented with four spaces.

They are an easy way of adding tables to your email -- a task that would otherwise require copy-pasting from another application.\n```\nColons can be used to align columns.\n\n| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |\n| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|\n| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |\n| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |\n| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |\n\nThere must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.\nThe outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the \nraw Markdown line up prettily.

Oh boy let's keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone.

Oh, you can *put* **Markdown** into a blockquote. \n\n## Inline HTML\nYou can also use raw HTML in your Markdown, and it'll mostly work pretty well.\n```\n<dl>\n  <dt>Definition list</dt>\n  <dd>Is something people use sometimes.</dd>\n\n  <dt>Markdown in HTML</dt>\n  <dd>Does *not* work **very** well.

You'll soon learn to get what you want. \"Markdown Toggle\" is your friend.\n\nHere are some things to try out:\n```\nHere's a line for us to start with.\n\nThis line is separated from the one above by two newlines, so it will be a *separate paragraph*.\n\nThis line is also a separate paragraph, but...\nThis line is only separated by a single newline, so it's a separate line in the *same paragraph*.\n```\nHere's a line for us to start with.\n\nThis line is separated from the one above by two newlines, so it will be a *separate paragraph*.\n\nThis line is also a separate paragraph, but...\nThis line is only separated by a single newline, so it's a separate line in the *same paragraph*.\n\n\n## External links\n* [Markdown Guide](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#headers)\n* [official website](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)\n* [wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)",

This will prevent any material that user(s) may post on most zites available. You can issue a global mute on a user by following these steps:  \n  1. Visit zeroid.bit or the Identification service that user is registered with\n  2. Click the button link that reads: \"Search in user database...\"\n  3. In the text box that appears, type in the users display name that you wish to mute. For example if the user's name was xyz@zeroid.bit, one would enter xyz\n  4. If a green 'found' message is displayed, click the yellow 'Mute User' button.\n  5. In the top right corder of your screen a Confirmation dialog will appear. Click 'Mute' to enable the global mute. Otherwise click the small [x] to the right of the Mute button to cancel the mute request and dismiss the dialog.\n  6. The user has been successfully muted. You can now close the ZeroID page and reload any pages to remove undesired posts or media.\n  \n### How do you unmute a user after muting them through zeroid?\n  * From the main menu on the ZeroHello (main page).
