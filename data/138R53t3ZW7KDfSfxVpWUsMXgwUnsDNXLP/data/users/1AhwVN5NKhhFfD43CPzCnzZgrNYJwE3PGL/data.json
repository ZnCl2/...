The language is based on an existing, international formatting standard SGML, Standard Generalized Mark-Up Language, which is used for text processing.\n\nWhat are the tags in HTML?\n--\nHTML tags are the hidden keywords within a web page that define how the browser must format and display the content. Most tags must have two parts, an opening and a closing part. For example, <html> is the opening tag and </html> is the closing tag.\n\nWhat is HTML used for?\n--\nHTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, is used to create web pages. Site authors use HTML to format text as titles and headings, to arrange graphics on a webpage, to link to different pages within a website, and to link to different websites.\n\nWhen was HTML invented?\n--\nIn 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, who was a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext system. Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990.",
