An IP address serves two principal functions: host or network interface identification and location addressing.\n\nWhat is the WWW?\n---\nThe [[World Wide Web]] (WWW) is an information space where documents and other web resources are identified by [[URL]]s, interlinked by hypertext links, and can be accessed via the Internet.\n\nWhat is the format of an IP address?\n---\nThe format of an IP address is a 32-bit numeric address written as four numbers separated by periods. Each number can be zero to 255. For example, 1.160.10.240 could be an IP address. Within an isolated network, you can assign IP addresses at random as long as each one is unique.\n\nHow do you access your IP address?\n---\nConnect to your router. Open a web browser and type this number – in this case 192.168.3.1 - into the address bar, then press Enter. (Don't add http:// before the IP address.) You should now see the login screen for your router.",

			"body": "Open Source\n---\n\nWhat is an open source code?\n---\nGenerally, open source refers to a computer program in which the source code is available to the general public for use and/or modification from its original design. Open-source code is meant to be a collaborative effort, where programmers improve upon the source code and share the changes within the community.\n\nWhat is the use of open source technology?\n---\nOpen source software is software whose source code is available for modification or enhancement by anyone. \"Source code\" is the part of software that most computer users don't ever see; it's the code computer programmers can manipulate to change how a piece of software—a \"program\" or \"application\"—works.\n\nWhat do you mean by open source operating system?\n---\nGenerically, open source refers to a program in which the source code is available to the general public for use and/or modification from its original design free of charge, i.e., open. Self-referentially, short for GNU's not UNIX, a UNIX-compatible software system developed by the Free Software Foundation (FSF).\n\nWhat is meant by free as in beer?\n---\nThis concept means \"a gift to you that does not cost you to acquire.\" For example, all freeware, all malware, and all published open source software that you can download for no cost. If you did not pay for it but you have it, then it's free as in beer. Also called: Gratis.",

			"body": "Python\n---\n\nWhat is Python programming language?\n---\nPython is a widely used general-purpose, high-level programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than would be possible in languages such as C++ or Java.\n\nWho created Python?\n---\nPython was conceived in the late 1980s and its implementation was started in December 1989 by Guido van Rossum at CWI in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC language (itself inspired by SETL) capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system.\n\nWhat is Python 2.7?\n---\nPython is a programming language. It's used for many different applications. It's used in some high schools and colleges as an introductory programming language because Python is easy to learn, but it's also used by professional software developers at places such as Google, NASA, and Lucasfilm Ltd.",

Tor is comprised of two parts: software you can download that allows you to use the Internet anonymously, and the volunteer network of computers that makes it possible for that software to work.\n\nWho created the Tor network?\n---\nThe core principle of Tor, \"onion routing\", was developed in the mid-1990s by United States Naval Research Laboratory employees, mathematician Paul Syverson and computer scientists Michael Reed and David Goldschlag, with the purpose of protecting U.S. intelligence communications online.\n\nIs it illegal to use the Tor Browser?\n---\nJust using Tor to browse the Internet is not illegal. The download is free, and hiding your IP address and browsing history is not, in and of itself, illegal. However, many of those that use Tor use it specifically for anonymity because they are doing something illegal.\n\nHow do you get to the deep Web?\n---\nTechnically, this is not a difficult process. You simply need to install and use Tor. Go to www.torproject.org and download the Tor Browser Bundle, which contains all the required tools. Run the downloaded file, choose an extraction location, then open the folder and click Start Tor Browser.",
