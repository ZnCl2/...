The first is to use the android ap, which can be downloaded from the [google playstore](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.mkg20001.zeronet), [zeronet](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1A9gZwjdcTh3bpdriaWm7Z4LNdUL8GhDu2), or [github](https://github.com/mkg20001/ZeroNet-kivy). \n\nThe other way is to install ZeroNet in one of the Linux Environments for Android. If one doesn't have root permissions then they can use [[Termux]], [DebianNoRoot](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cuntubuntu) or [GNURoot](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=champion.gnuroot). If one had rooted their device then they can use either \"[The Complete Linux Installer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zpwebsites.linuxonandroid)\" or \"[Linux Deploy](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.meefik.linuxdeploy)\".\n\n# Pros & Cons of Each Method\n\nThe android ap works well and is easy to install but it is difficult to backup ones data because it requires the android debug bridge. It also does not work properly with Tor due to sandboxing between android applications in non-rooted environments. One can still use Tor as a proxy to connect to trackers in the android ap without rooting their device but when Zeronet is properly functioning properly with Tor then each node communicates to each other within the tor network and no exit nodes are required. Given that rooting voids peoples warranty a good alternative to getting Tor to work with Zeronet on android -- that doesn't involve rooting One's device -- is to use an Android Linux Environment that does not depend on rooting ones phone such as [[Termux]]. As a plus this will let one combine ZeroNet with other tools such as proxy tools (e.g. Privoxy, Web Servers (e.g. Nginx) and even redirect their ZeroNet Web Interface through SSH tunnels so that it is Invisible to the rest of the applications on the android environment.
