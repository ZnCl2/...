			"body": "HTML\n---\n\nWhat is HTML?\n--\nHTML, which stands for HyperText Mark-Up Language, is the language for describing structured documents as well as the language used to create web pages in the Internet. The language is based on an existing, international formatting standard SGML, Standard Generalized Mark-Up Language, which is used for text processing.\n\nWhat are the tags in HTML?\n--\nHTML tags are the hidden keywords within a web page that define how the browser must format and display the content. Most tags must have two parts, an opening and a closing part. For example, <html> is the opening tag and </html> is the closing tag.\n\nWhat is HTML used for?\n--\nHTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, is used to create web pages. Site authors use HTML to format text as titles and headings, to arrange graphics on a webpage, to link to different pages within a website, and to link to different websites.\n\nWhen was HTML invented?\n--\nIn 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, who was a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext system. Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990.",

However, there's no notice of which links point where without examining the target URL (which may not be possible or enabled in some browsers). Personally, I think there should be either an automatic marker for clearnet sites, or a notice on the article to alert users of what links leave ZeroNet. It's also worth noting that in the future, some users may be accessing ZeroNet without access to the traditional internet/web, making these essentially dead links. Thoughts?\n\n*Thought*: I think we need to specify where the link will take the user, like **Bitcoin on the English Wikipedia**. That should be enough to explain what's going on. Also, the user can see the link if they hover it. ***muja@zeroid.bit***\n\n*second thought*: clear phrasing is important, but it migth be better to use a simple icon to indicate clearnet sites. Something like a paperclip or Wikipedia's boxes-with-an-arrow icon would work. Here's more info: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:External_link_icons  \nUsing a different color might work too (e.g. a slightly lighter shade of blue), but not all monitors will be able display the difference.\n\n*Third thought*: We really have three types of pages that articles can link to: other zerowiki articles, pages on other zites, and clearnet pages. That makes for two kinds of external links, the second one being 'more' external. We may or may not want to have different ways of handling those two.\n\nGood points. I think both would help a lot but since there are three *kinds* of links, different colors would look better than different arrows.  ***muja@zeroid.bit***\n\nMaybe a (red/yellow/green depending on the target) dot near the link?\n\n*Somewhat related thought*: Regarding the dead kinks issue, someone could create an archive zite with optional files (like web.archive.org).\n\n*Issue with coloring*: Some users in the future may be able to get a theme for ZeroNet, and all links may be the same color in that theme. ***scrub@zeroid.bit***\n\n----\n\n### To Link Is To Do\n\nThere's a problem with ZeroNet links because the host part http://host:port differs a lot from client to client and especially for proxies:\n\nTry a link via 127.0.0.1:43110 using a proxy or with a different port number in your local setup... it'll fail...\n\n* [Official zite](http://127.0.0.1:43110/search.kaffie.bit/) [📎](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1Mr5rX9TauvaGReB4RjCaE6D37FJQaY5Ba)\n\n```\n* [Official zite](http://127.0.0.1:43110/search.kaffie.bit/) [📎](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1Mr5rX9TauvaGReB4RjCaE6D37FJQaY5Ba)\n```\n\nLink without HOST part works with proxies too:\n\n* [Official zite](/search.kaffie.bit/) [📎](/1Mr5rX9TauvaGReB4RjCaE6D37FJQaY5Ba)\n\n```\n* [Official zite](/search.kaffie.bit/) [📎](/1Mr5rX9TauvaGReB4RjCaE6D37FJQaY5Ba)\n```\n\n...seen something like that @ Himalaya...\n\n...bye² from Alfie...\n\n----\n\n-> but there is afaik an addon, that makes urls like http://search.kaffie.bit usable … that would probably break it, not sure so. But agree, relative paths would be better.\n\n----\n\nUsing 127.0.0.1-Links force you to use a local client.\nProxies soon will be a common entry point to ZeroNet.\nStripping http://host:port so kinda getting an absolute path relative to current host and port work best for me...\n\n-- *yeti 20160314-1933-GMT*.\n\n----\n\nThere definitely needs to be a standardized way of linking to ZeroNet sites. Relative linking works, but it indeed absolutely breaks the chrome extension. The other option is to simply build the URL depending on what the visitor's current URL is. It's not a simple 'a' tag and requires a bit of javascript magic, but certainly works. Kaffiene does something like this.\n\n---\n\nI'm not sure, but I think zeronet automatically replaces the host:port part.

However, there's no notice of which links point where without examining the target URL (which may not be possible or enabled in some browsers). Personally, I think there should be either an automatic marker for clearnet sites, or a notice on the article to alert users of what links leave ZeroNet. It's also worth noting that in the future, some users may be accessing ZeroNet without access to the traditional internet/web, making these essentially dead links. Thoughts?\n\n*Thought*: I think we need to specify where the link will take the user, like **Bitcoin on the English Wikipedia**. That should be enough to explain what's going on. Also, the user can see the link if they hover it. ***muja@zeroid.bit***\n\n*second thought*: clear phrasing is important, but it migth be better to use a simple icon to indicate clearnet sites. Something like a paperclip or Wikipedia's boxes-with-an-arrow icon would work. Here's more info: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:External_link_icons  \nUsing a different color might work too (e.g. a slightly lighter shade of blue), but not all monitors will be able display the difference.\n\n*Third thought*: We really have three types of pages that articles can link to: other zerowiki articles, pages on other zites, and clearnet pages. That makes for two kinds of external links, the second one being 'more' external. We may or may not want to have different ways of handling those two.\n\nGood points. I think both would help a lot but since there are three *kinds* of links, different colors would look better than different arrows.  ***muja@zeroid.bit***\n\nMaybe a (red/yellow/green depending on the target) dot near the link?\n\n*Somewhat related thought*: Regarding the dead kinks issue, someone could create an archive zite with optional files (like web.archive.org).\n\n*Issue with coloring*: Some users in the future may be able to get a theme for ZeroNet, and all links may be the same color in that theme. ***scrub@zeroid.bit***\n----\n\n### To Link Is To Do\n\nThere's a problem with ZeroNet links because the host part http://host:port differs a lot from client to client and especially for proxies:\n\nTry a link via 127.0.0.1:43110 using a proxy or with a different port number in your local setup... it'll fail...\n\n* [Official zite](http://127.0.0.1:43110/search.kaffie.bit/) [📎](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1Mr5rX9TauvaGReB4RjCaE6D37FJQaY5Ba)\n\n```\n* [Official zite](http://127.0.0.1:43110/search.kaffie.bit/) [📎](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1Mr5rX9TauvaGReB4RjCaE6D37FJQaY5Ba)\n```\n\nLink without HOST part works with proxies too:\n\n* [Official zite](/search.kaffie.bit/) [📎](/1Mr5rX9TauvaGReB4RjCaE6D37FJQaY5Ba)\n\n```\n* [Official zite](/search.kaffie.bit/) [📎](/1Mr5rX9TauvaGReB4RjCaE6D37FJQaY5Ba)\n```\n\n...seen something like that @ Himalaya...\n\n...bye² from Alfie...\n\n----\n\n-> but there is afaik an addon, that makes urls like http://search.kaffie.bit usable … that would probably break it, not sure so. But agree, relative paths would be better.\n\n----\n\nUsing 127.0.0.1-Links force you to use a local client.\nProxies soon will be a common entry point to ZeroNet.\nStripping http://host:port so kinda getting an absolute path relative to current host and port work best for me...\n\n-- *yeti 20160314-1933-GMT*.\n\n----\n\nThere definitely needs to be a standardized way of linking to ZeroNet sites. Relative linking works, but it indeed absolutely breaks the chrome extension. The other option is to simply build the URL depending on what the visitor's current URL is. It's not a simple 'a' tag and requires a bit of javascript magic, but certainly works. Kaffiene does something like this.\n\n---\n\nI'm not sure, but I think zeronet automatically replaces the host:port part. See the links on http://127.0.0.1:43110/main.0rc.bit , which are automatically translated to 0net://sitename.bit and then back to the correct url.\n\n---\n\nMaybe put `zero://<link>` instead of `http://<link>`, add a method to the Zero API to get the base (either `localhost:43110`, or any other). Let a JS script run on every page that translates `zero://` links to the good link ?\n\n> *KindlyFire 13/06/16*\n\n---\n\n### Categories\n\nWe eventually will need a 'categories' box at the bottom of each page, where each category links to articles under that same category.

Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than would be possible in languages such as C++ or Java.\n\nWho created Python?\n---\nPython was conceived in the late 1980s and its implementation was started in December 1989 by Guido van Rossum at CWI in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC language (itself inspired by SETL) capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system.\n\nWhat is Python 2.7?\n---\nPython is a programming language. It's used for many different applications. It's used in some high schools and colleges as an introductory programming language because Python is easy to learn, but it's also used by professional software developers at places such as Google, NASA, and Lucasfilm Ltd.",

Open-source code is meant to be a collaborative effort, where programmers improve upon the source code and share the changes within the community.\n\nWhat is the use of open source technology?\n---\nOpen source software is software whose source code is available for modification or enhancement by anyone. \"Source code\" is the part of software that most computer users don't ever see; it's the code computer programmers can manipulate to change how a piece of software—a \"program\" or \"application\"—works.\n\nWhat do you mean by open source operating system?\n---\nGenerically, open source refers to a program in which the source code is available to the general public for use and/or modification from its original design free of charge, i.e., open. Self-referentially, short for GNU's not UNIX, a UNIX-compatible software system developed by the Free Software Foundation (FSF).\n\nWhat is meant by free as in beer?\n---\nThis concept means \"a gift to you that does not cost you to acquire.\" For example, all freeware, all malware, and all published open source software that you can download for no cost.

Tor is comprised of two parts: software you can download that allows you to use the Internet anonymously, and the volunteer network of computers that makes it possible for that software to work.\n\nWho created the Tor network?\n---\nThe core principle of Tor, \"onion routing\", was developed in the mid-1990s by United States Naval Research Laboratory employees, mathematician Paul Syverson and computer scientists Michael Reed and David Goldschlag, with the purpose of protecting U.S. intelligence communications online.\n\nIs it illegal to use the Tor Browser?\n---\nJust using Tor to browse the Internet is not illegal. The download is free, and hiding your IP address and browsing history is not, in and of itself, illegal. However, many of those that use Tor use it specifically for anonymity because they are doing something illegal.\n\nHow do you get to the deep Web?\n---\nTechnically, this is not a difficult process. You simply need to install and use Tor. Go to www.torproject.org and download the Tor Browser Bundle, which contains all the required tools.
