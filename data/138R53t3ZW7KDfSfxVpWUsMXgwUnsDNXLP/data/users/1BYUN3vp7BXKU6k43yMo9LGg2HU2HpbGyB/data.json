			"body": "# Bitcoin\n\n**Bitcoin** is a digital asset and a payment system invented by [[Satoshi Nakamoto]], who published the invention in 2008 and released it as [[open-source]] software in 2009. The system is [[peer-to-peer]]; users can transact directly without an intermediary. Transactions are verified by network [[nodes]] and recorded in a public distributed ledger called the [[blockchain]]. \n\nThe ledger uses bitcoin as its unit of account. The system works without a central repository or single administrator, which has led the U.S. Treasury to categorize bitcoin as a decentralized virtual currency. Bitcoin is often called the first [[cryptocurrency]], although prior systems existed. Bitcoin is more correctly described as the first decentralized digital currency. It is the largest of its kind in terms of total market value.\n\n## External links\n\n[Bitcoin Wiki](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1Pqq7TeAyCdVDqm2EN6PE9QVKHawzWyFmc)\n\n[Bitcoin on the English Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin) (clearnet)\n\ncool",
