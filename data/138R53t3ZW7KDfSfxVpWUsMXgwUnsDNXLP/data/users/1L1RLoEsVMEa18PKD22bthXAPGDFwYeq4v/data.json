The website owner has to enable this in the site's [[content.json]] by setting the boolean \"`cloneable`\" to \"`true`\", then [[signing]] and [[publishing]] it.\n\n## %-default directories\n\nWhen cloning, every file and directory is skipped if it has \"`-default`\" postfixed alternative and then the \"`-default`\" postfix will be removed from the affected files and directories.",
