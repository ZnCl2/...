Do you want to load the changes?\"\n\nPlease report bugs in this section.\n\n## Feature Requests\n\nPlease add feature requests here.\n+ Localization for pages (example - we have [[Help]] page with default language (en) but if we add ?lang=$name you can get localized version)\n+ upload content (images) but only as optional files\n+  interface localization \n+ if 2 people editing page at the same time - show alert\n+ Global 'recent changes' page\n+ highlight difference between version when open history (like github)\n+ protected pages\n+ moderators\n* creative commons license for easier (legal) modification of articles\n+ anchor to elements\n+ code element\n* seperate ZeroWiki: sites from normal sites\n* support [ [wikisite|alternative naming] ]\n* Optional short user entered message for edits shown on the History page\n* Talk page for each wiki page to keep discussions about edits off the articles\n* More markdown elements support like quotes >, tables, etc\n\n----\n\n### To Link Is To Do\n\nThere's a problem with ZeroNet links because the host part http://host:port differs a lot from client to client and especially for proxies:\n\nTry a link via 127.0.0.1:43110 using a proxy or with a different port number in your local setup... it'll fail...\n\n* [Official zite](http://127.0.0.1:43110/search.kaffie.bit/) [ðŸ“Ž](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1Mr5rX9TauvaGReB4RjCaE6D37FJQaY5Ba)\n\n```\n* [Official zite](http://127.0.0.1:43110/search.kaffie.bit/) [ðŸ“Ž](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1Mr5rX9TauvaGReB4RjCaE6D37FJQaY5Ba)\n```\n\nLink without HOST part works with proxies too:\n\n* [Official zite](/search.kaffie.bit/) [ðŸ“Ž](/1Mr5rX9TauvaGReB4RjCaE6D37FJQaY5Ba)\n\n```\n* [Official zite](/search.kaffie.bit/) [ðŸ“Ž](/1Mr5rX9TauvaGReB4RjCaE6D37FJQaY5Ba)\n```\n\n...seen something like that @ Himalaya...\n\n...byeÂ² from Alfie...\n\n----\n\n-> but there is afaik an addon, that makes urls like http://search.kaffie.bit usable â€¦ that would probably break it, not sure so. But agree, relative paths would be better.\n\n----\n\nUsing 127.0.0.1-Links force you to use a local client.\nProxies soon will be a common entry point to ZeroNet.\nStripping http://host:port so kinda getting an absolute path relative to current host and port work best for me...\n\n-- *yeti 20160314-1933-GMT*.\n\n----\n\nThere definitely needs to be a standardized way of linking to ZeroNet sites. Relative linking works, but it indeed absolutely breaks the chrome extension. The other option is to simply build the URL depending on what the visitor's current URL is. It's not a simple 'a' tag and requires a bit of javascript magic, but certainly works. Kaffiene does something like this.",
