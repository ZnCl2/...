			"body": "One of the areas zeronet could be improved is that each item is currently unique by default.\nThat means (hash-)identical items cannot be identified and commonly shared, even among merger-sites.\n\nThat leads to a very fragile state of optional files and content in cases not everyone shares all of the items of a bigger site default.\n\nAn example would be a shared picture or other informational item, which the original author might decide to deleted due to various reasons and therefore \"disappears\" the very second that decision to delete gets published.\nDespite other seeders/peers having that item still cached, there is no chance to preserve or save it _as the unique item it was shared_ and referenced to by others on that site within zeronet.\nSo even if someone got the chance to archive that very same item and re-add it once again, it then has to be re-discovered by all other peers, starting its peer count with 0 again.\n\nThis is slightly worse compared to a deleted and reuploaded video on youtube, as on youtube the new video does not suffer from the reset peer count as does a video on zeronet.\n\nAnother problem is the context that might have been built around this item would likely be worthless too, since any additional explanation, information, commentary and voting would be missing its original context item.\n\nAnyone having ideas how to possibly solve this within zeronet (I know IPFS tackles this very problem, but is yet another technology), let's hear in the comments."
