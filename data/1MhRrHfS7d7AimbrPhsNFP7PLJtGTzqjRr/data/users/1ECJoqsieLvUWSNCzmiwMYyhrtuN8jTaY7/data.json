As human beings we adapt and our vocabulary and languages need to be just as versatile.\n\n When it comes to discrimination in writing, one cannot write for a varied audience if one cannot see their humanity for one's own biases. In this way, I cannot condone writing that is filled with racial discrimination, sexism, ableism, nor any other type of discrimination as being objective and neutral. Indeed, if one's mind has been founded on these ideas, as everyone's has in some way or another, we must all strive to break down these barriers to our thinking objectively, logically, and critically. We will get nowhere if we dehumanize and demean each other.  \n\nAs for the internet, this is why we must all come together to share only things that can be verified as true when sharing information. If we continue on our current course of sharing fake news, click bait, personal opinions passed off as fact, etc. We will only continue the demise of the internet as a place of shared knowledge and connection.\n\n\n",
