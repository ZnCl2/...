Just the Python parser read `7.` and assume it is a float number, then find out `7.to_bytes(1, 'big')` is an invalid float. JavaScript uses a similar stupid parser. `7.toString()` in JavaScript will cause an unexpected token error, need to use `(7).toString()` instead. Modern languages like Ceylon, Kotlin, and Swift is free from this issue.",
