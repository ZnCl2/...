No one choice is going to be perfect for everyone.\n### [Free](?Page:freedom) web browsers\n***\n### Mozilla Firefox and friends\n[Mozilla Firefox](?Page:firefox) is a free and open source web browser descended from the Netscape Communicator. It is known for its championing of the open web during Internet Explorer's reign of terror and its extensive customisability via add-ons and settings. Although many other browsers now support third-party extensions, Firefox's add-ons generally tend to be a cut above the rest.\n\nNumerous forks and spin-offs of Firefox exist and are a common sight on /g/ and /tech/ given Firefox's perceived transition into a Chrome-imitating memory whore, for example [Pale Moon](https://www.palemoon.org/) and [Waterfox](https://www.waterfoxproject.org/). The most \"free\" fork would be [GNU Icecat](https://www.gnu.org/software/gnuzilla/), a fully free, libre, open-source (FLOSS) fork of Firefox without its built-in DRM support and Firefox Hello. Comes with LibreJS, an add-on which blocks out any non-free javascript on webpages. Mozilla offers a [developer edition](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/) of Firefox, which most notably ditches the controversial \"Australis\" theme which ships with recent versions of Firefox.\n\n### Chromium\n[[Chromium]] is a free and open-source ~~Web-Browser~~ botnet known for its extremely fast JavaScript execution and multiprocess security model. Upon release, Chromium was ahead of the competition by leaps and bounds in terms of raw performance. In the years that followed though, Firefox and Opera largely equalled and in some cases surpassed its performance advantage, although Chromium still tends to maintain a slight edge in UI responsiveness and JavaScript execution. While usually recommended for use, many users stay away from this browser as it has not been audited as much as Firefox has, and in protest of its (easy to disable) tracking features.\n\nIf you're thinking of switching to Chromium (Google's open source version of Chrome) instead, think again. For some time, [Chromium snuck in a binary blob for voice recognition whenever you started it up](https://archive.is/4VijY). This has been [removed](https://archive.is/2C86X) by the project maintainers, but it should raise some concern over what else could be lurking in the code. \n\nHowever, if you absolutely must use a Chrom* based browser, Iridium would be the best choice, as it is a FLOSS fork of Chromium stripped of as many botnet features as possible. It [used to phone home to Iridium's servers](https://archive.is/VQ2I9) for development purposes, but [it no longer does that](https://github.com/iridium-browser/iridium-browser/issues/55).\n* Last version to support Windows XP is 50, so if you're running it please use Firefox for your privacy and security, as it's continuously updated for now.\n\n### [[Proprietary]] web browsers\n***\n### Google Chrome\n[Google Chrome](?Page:chromium) is a [[Botnet]] ~~proprietary fork~~ of the free and open source Chromium project. While effectively offering the same browsing experience as Chromium, it integrates Google's \"Pepper\" Flash plugin, a Foxit-based PDF reader and controversial user-tracking capabilities. If you value your privacy or reputation on /g/ and /tech/, it's best to avoid this one.\n\n### Opera\nOpera is one of the oldest web browsers that is still under active development. Up to version 12.16, Opera was based on its in-house Presto layout engine and characterised by its customisability, innovation, broad out-of-the-box feature set (including a torrent client, email, IRC and FTP support) and respect for web standards. Several now ubiquitous features like tabbed browsing and speed dial made their d√©buts in Opera.\n\nWith the release of version 15, Opera development radically changed direction. Presto was discontinued in favour of Chromium's Blink layout engine and numerous features were excised, with the email client becoming a standalone program and GNU/Linux support and native 64-bit builds both being suspended (although the former has made a recent comeback). As a result, \"Chropera\" is often derided as a shadow of its former self, and a small minority of /g/ and /tech/ users fervently stick to the archaic old version.\n*It was bought by chinks a few months ago, tread carefully if you do want to use the newest Opera.\n\n### Internet Explorer\nInternet Explorer is the default web browser in [Microsoft's](?Page:Microsoft) Windows operating systems, and is based on Microsoft's Trident layout engine. Before version 9, Internet Explorer was infamous for its myriad of security vulnerabilities, poor performance, disregard for most web standards and perversion of the few that it bothered to acknowledge. since then, however, Microsoft has been actively developing Internet Explorer into a tolerable web browser, and has even discontinued the brand name in order to distance themselves from its notoriety.\n\n### Edge\nBasically, it's Internet Explorer version 12. Has a new user interface somewhat optimized for tablets. Tons of new features were promised before Windows 10 was released, most were not implemented. Currently even Internet Explorer is better and has more features. It is the first browser to implement the very promising Chakra JavaScript engine.\n\n### Safari\nSafari is the default web browser in [Apple's](?Page:Apple) Mac OS X. It is based on Apple's Webkit layout engine, a KHTML fork. Compared to Chromium and Firefox, Safari has a slow development cycle and is lacking in features.\n\n### Vivaldi\nA new browser that is being developed targeting former users of Opera who became disgruntled with the change in direction in Opera's development. It aims to bring back the feel and features of Opera 12.\n",
