A VPN uses a tunneling technology, such as SSL, through different tunnelling protocols to establish private links through the internet to other computers.\n\nVPNs are typically used to avoid geo-blocking, passive surveillance or government filtering. A VPN may make you appear as if you're from a different country. Joe Schmo on the internet trying to backtrace your IP will lose the trail at your VPN provider. Hackers infecting your system won't be phased, and neither will law enforcement.\n\nVPNs aren't a panacea when it comes to privacy. Even if your provider claims they don't keep logs, that doesn't mean you trust them, especially if they're located in a [[Five Eyes]] country. A VPN will improve your privacy, however it will not do much to improve your anonymity. For making yourself anonymous on the internet, see [[Anonymising Yourself]]. \n\n##Choosing a VPN\n\nIt is very important you do your research when deciding on a VPN. Remember, you're giving these guys your traffic instead of your ISP. Some VPNs are made for privacy, and don't log, while others are made just for getting past geoblocks. When choosing a VPN, you want to consider these things:\n\n* What country is this VPN operating in? (A Five/Nine Eyes country like the US, or a privacy-safe one like Switzerland)\n* Do they log your traffic, and what IPs you connect with?\n* Do they have trackers on their website? (Looking at you, PIA)\n* Can you pay anonymously? (Still won't matter much since they know your IP, unless you chain more than one VPN)\n* How much does it cost?\n\nAlso be careful when reading VPN reviews. The link you click on may very well be affiliate link. PIA, HideMyAss, and other mainstream VPN providers are known for their affiliate programs. When reading a review, make sure it doesn't sound like an advertisement. If you want user reviews, you're best off on [https://reddit.com/r/VPN](/r/VPN), or [https://4chan.org/g/vpn](/vpn/).
