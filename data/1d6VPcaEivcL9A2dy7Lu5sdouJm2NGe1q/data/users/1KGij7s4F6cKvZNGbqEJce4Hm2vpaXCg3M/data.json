Source code does not have to be released if binaries to modifications are not released to the public.\n\nThe GPL is copyleft in that any derived work needs to be distributed under the same terms.

They allow authors to grant permissions to others for redistribution and modification which would otherwise violate normal copyright. Please note copyright law is separate from patent and trademark law. Those may impose additional restrictions on the use of a work.\n### No license\n***\nWithout an explicit license default copyright law usually applies. All rights are reserved and no one may copy, redistribute or make derivatives of the work. However, publishing on some platforms like GitHub and YouTube requires accepting a terms of service which may automatically grant some rights to others. In general, if you want your work to be shared or built upon you should always pick a license. The Free Software Foundation doesn't recommend neglecting to choose a license because [it will render the work non-free.](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#NoLicense)\n### Public domain\n***\nWorks automatically enter the public domain in most countries after the life of the author plus 70 years. It also consists of things which are not eligible for copyright like math formulas, some government works and logos consisting only of typefaces, words, slogans or simple geometric shapes. There is no easy way for authors to completely donate their work to the public domain before the copyright expires. The easiest way to essentially opt-out of copyright is to use a license that surrenders as many rights as possible like CC0.\n### Free Software Foundation\n***\nThese licenses were made by the Free Software Foundation to support the GNU project and other free software.\n#### GNU GPL\n![alt text](img/GPL.png \"GPL Logo\")\nThe General Public License was originally written by [[Richard Stallman]] and is probably the most popular FOSS license. It guarantees end users the four essential freedoms that define free software. Those are the freedoms to run, study, share and modify the software. Essentially, you are free to do what you want with software released under this, provided that if you release it to the public you must also release the source code. Source code does not have to be released if binaries to modifications are not released to the public.\n\nThe GPL is copyleft in that any derived work needs to be distributed under the same terms. In this way it demands the work stays free so it can benefit everyone. The work can never be used in proprietary software. Think of it as a license that grants you every freedom, except the freedom to take away other people's freedom over the software. This license highly favors the end users. The Linux kernel is licensed under GPLv2.\n#### GNU AGPL\nThe Affero GPL is essentially the GPL with an additional provision that users interacting with the software over a network must also get the source. With the popularity of \"cloud\" services, GPL software can be changed and run at a server without the obligation to release the source code. This is called the \"application service provider loophole\" and the AGPL closes it. The FSF recommends the AGPL for programs that are likely to be used on servers like interactive web applications, mail, web and game servers. \n#### ",

			"body": "## UNIX\n***\n**UNIX** is a kernel-type developed by [[AT&T]] and [[Bell Labs]] in the early 1970's. Originally a [[proprietary]] system, many forks were made leading to the *nix (or UNIX-like) systems we see today, such as the [[GNU/Linux]] system, [[GNU Hurd]], The [Berkeley Software Distribution](?Page:bsd) (and its many derivatives), etc.\n\nUNIX was originally created by the same people who invented the C Programming language. Their goal was to make a cheap, easy-to-use system written in their new language. This is where the UNIX Philosophy comes from. Most of the people who made UNIX went on to make the superior system Plan 9.\n### The UNIX Philosophy\n***\n_(Not to be confused with [The GNU Philosophy](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy))_ \n\nIn the age of UNIX, computers were very slow and expensive to run. This is where The UNIX Philosophy came from. The UNIX Philosophy simply states that a single program should be dedicated to one single thing, and do it well. This allowed many small programs to be a part of the UNIX system, all working together to perform basic system tasks. Piping, timesharing, and a variety of other goodies all went into the UNIX system.\n### What does RMS think?\n***\n[RMS](?Page:richard-stallman) never liked UNIX. He only chose UNIX for The GNU Project because he thought it was a good-enough model, and better than anything else at the time. However, he commonly uses UNIX and other *nix systems since the early 1980's. UNIX was standard and what everyone knew. If he started later, he probably would have made a clone of Macintosh or a clone of Windows. RMS' dislike for UNIX and the UNIX philosophy has brought hatred from usergroups outside GNU to GNU-made software, calling him a political activist rather than a programmer, and stemming a phrase GNU's Not Usable. GNU suffers from a lot of bloat, and other usergroups believe that the average GNU programmer is more concerned about the license than the code. Prove them wrong. \n\n\n",

Originally a [[proprietary]] system, many forks were made leading to the *nix (or UNIX-like) systems we see today, such as the [[GNU/Linux]] system, [[GNU Hurd]], The [Berkeley Software Distribution](?Page:BSD) (and its many derivatives), etc.\n\nUNIX was originally created by the same people who invented the C Programming language. Their goal was to make a cheap, easy-to-use system written in their new language. This is where the UNIX Philosophy comes from. Most of the people who made UNIX went on to make the superior system Plan 9.\n### The UNIX Philosophy\n***\n_(Not to be confused with [The GNU Philosophy](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy))_ \n\nIn the age of UNIX, computers were very slow and expensive to run. This is where The UNIX Philosophy came from. The UNIX Philosophy simply states that a single program should be dedicated to one single thing, and do it well. This allowed many small programs to be a part of the UNIX system, all working together to perform basic system tasks. Piping, timesharing, and a variety of other goodies all went into the UNIX system.\n### What does RMS think?\n***\n[RMS](?Page:richard-stallman) never liked UNIX. He only chose UNIX for The GNU Project because he thought it was a good-enough model, and better than anything else at the time. However, he commonly uses UNIX and other *nix systems since the early 1980's. UNIX was standard and what everyone knew. If he started later, he probably would have made a clone of Macintosh or a clone of Windows. RMS' dislike for UNIX and the UNIX philosophy has brought hatred from usergroups outside GNU to GNU-made software, calling him a political activist rather than a programmer, and stemming a phrase GNU's Not Usable. GNU suffers from a lot of bloat, and other usergroups believe that the average GNU programmer is more concerned about the license than the code. Prove them wrong. \n\n\n",

Achieving total freedom in one's use of technology is the greatest accomplishment a Man can attain. There are rumours that when this happens, golden light starts to emanate from your computer screen and Richard Stallman materializes in your room.

Access to the source code is a precondition for this.\n* Freedom 2: The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor.\n* Freedom 3: The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others. By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.",
