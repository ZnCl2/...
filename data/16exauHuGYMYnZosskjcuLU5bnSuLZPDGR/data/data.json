			"body": "![Red Star](https://i.imgur.com/a7U1cLL.jpg)\n\nI came across a book recently which I'm about half way through, it's called [Red Star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Star_%28novel%29) and written by Bolshevik [Alexander Bogdanov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Bogdanov). I certainly recommend this book to everyone that can be bothered to read.\n\nUnfortunately (?) the book was written over one hundred years ago and the science is well behind, but it does delve into communist ideals which I wasn't formerly aware. For instance, did you know that communists - of that period at least - preferred clothes for their functionality over their fashion properties? \n\nGo grab the book from [here](http://www.monoskop.org/images/4/48/Bogdanov_Alexander_Red_Star_The_First_Bolshevik_Utopia.pdf)."

			"body": "Like the rest of you, I studied foreign languages at school... and like the rest of you, I left without knowing a word. Last year I picked up Esperanto, now I know ~1000+ root words which can be combined with suffixes and prefixes to make thousands more words. I highly recommend having a look at the Duolingo course for this awesome language: https://www.duolingo.com/course/eo/en/Learn-Esperanto-Online"
