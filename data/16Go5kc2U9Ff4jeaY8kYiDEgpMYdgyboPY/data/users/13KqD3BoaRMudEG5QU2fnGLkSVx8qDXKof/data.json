				"body": "> [couldbeworse](#comment_1_13TYHUzdFf2JuFtoDD1eTKHppNGcTemkTN): My favourite GNU/Linux desktop distribution is Trisquel ( https://trisquel.info/) and for a server I use Debian (https://www.debian.org/). I also have an old MacBook running Xubuntu (http://xubuntu.org/) and a Raspberry Pi running Raspbian 'Jessie'. My 10 year old son is using Linux Mint (http://www.linuxmint.com/).\n> Never leave home without a Tails live USB (https://tails.boum.org/).\n\nThe foss distros are pretty cool. Linux Mint is super easy. I think that is the distro to recommend to anyone wanting to try out Linux as a first timer. After getting some experience using Debian or Trisquel are both good choices. Ubuntu is ran by a company that seems to prioritize profits over user freedom, but other than that it is very easy to use. \n\nTails is great. Also look how to make a Whonix USB here: http://yuxv6qujajqvmypv.onion/ (tor hidden service)",
