With box86 I am able to run steam and play games like Portal and The Stanley Parable. I'm running zeronet from my pi4 right now. I can watch Netflix, Amazon Prime, use Spotify, etc. \n\nAt the end of the day though, any distro can be customized to look like and behave like nearly every other distro out there, what we should be focusing on is architecture. Arm is the future folks!",
