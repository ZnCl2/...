That, and because most likely if you drop KDE onto someone who's never touched linux before they'll most likely break it by playing around with its multitude of settings and when they break it, they blame the distribution/linux for being broken and then never touch it again. That's why you only really see KDE on more \"advanced\" distros like NixOS or Gentoo. \nI agree though, I wish there was something else other than the same Gnome+SystemD cancer that infects linux currently.",
