Since it's the only option in Tails I have use it and always ask myself the same questions.\n\nMost ridiculous fact is that there's no context menu entry for creating a text file/empty file in the file manager. But there is one for a terminal (which I like, but would have both) so I always have to \"touch newfile.txt\" from the terminal. Usability in the 21st century. ",
