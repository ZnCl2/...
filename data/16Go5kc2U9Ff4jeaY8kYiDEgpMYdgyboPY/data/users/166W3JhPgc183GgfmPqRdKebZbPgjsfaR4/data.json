But for a desktop and mouse it requires to much mouse movement to get from one application to another.  Repetitive motion can be a problem with gnome 3 if you use a mouse. Also gnome 3 stability is another issue. They need to fix there bugs. Also going to a website to get widgets to add to your desktop is a DOS attack away from a complete kill shot to modifying your desktop. When gnome can fix these issues they will be going some where. I agree with Linus on Gnome 3.\n\nGnome is nice for ir's developper, if you configure shortcuts tnah you won't need that much of mous",
