I kept using Ubuntu many years because the community is important and help can save time ;)\nI tried Fedora in 2012 but I don't have a racing computer so the graphical effects are not good at screen. \nLubuntu is a good OS, simple and efficient, it shares the technology of Ubuntu so everything works fine. \nI'm using Raspbian right now (the OS of Raspberry ;) ) and everything works too. It's lighter, faster and you can use it everyday ! \nMaybe you could try it and tell me you mind ;)",
