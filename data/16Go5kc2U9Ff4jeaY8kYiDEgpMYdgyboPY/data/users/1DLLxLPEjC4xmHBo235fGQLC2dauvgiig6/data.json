Even KDE was well behind it in terms of user base. Only OpenSusSe and Slackware didn't have Gnome as default but the former had a Gnome spin.\nWhen Gnome 3 came out nobody really liked it but people stuck with it because it had a fallback mode and everyone was hoping the devs would get their shit together soon enough. Unfortunately they didn't, Gnome kept it's momentum and we lost the chance to kill the abomination while it was still young. \nI'm now on Xfce, it has a sane interface and the development is slow.",
