			"body": "I have been using Linux Mint for something like 7 or  8 years, because it has drivers for nearly everything.  It has worked out of the box on essentially every computer I have tried it on.  My next favorite is Zorin Lite, because it runs well on old, under-powered computers, but I haven't used it in a while.",

One of the few things I don't like about it is that the touchpad driver causes hesitation when you first begin to move the pointer.",
