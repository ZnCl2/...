				"body": "> [cyborg420](#comment_1_1126H2juNUiz3uTyBnXp2BtVEL7wciMNWq): i quite like gnome 3 - everything works as it should, and I have controls that just work and some non linux guru can use. (friends etc...) but only with sddm. gdm and lightdm are just utter garbage. (with sddm i have no crash issues and the ram usage is sooo much lower.)\n\nI think that gnome 3 would work well with a touch screen. But for a desktop and mouse it requires to much mouse movement to get from one application to another.  Repetitive motion can be a problem with gnome 3 if you use a mouse. Also gnome 3 stability is another issue. They need to fix there bugs. Also going to a website to get widgets to add to your desktop is a DOS attack away from a complete kill shot to modifying your desktop. When gnome can fix these issues they will be going some where. I agree with Linus on Gnome 3. ",
