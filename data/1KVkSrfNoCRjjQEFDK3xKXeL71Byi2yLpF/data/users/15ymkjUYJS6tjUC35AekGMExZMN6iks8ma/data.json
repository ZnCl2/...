			"body": "@razkal I am sad to read the news about the situation in Brazil. The unemployment has doubled;  the president will stand trial (if I remember it correctly); many companies (e.g. Petrobras) has huge debts in the dollar, which has increased in value; and it looks like it going to be another year of negative growth.  However, as you write, political change is a first step out of this even if it will take time but this is maybe a good opportunity to get started, and you can go a long way with basic understanding and investing principles. Since the market is unstable, and I am cautious, I do not do much trading right now, so I am actually planning to write about my own trading/investment principles and book recommendations. I hope to publish at least one of those post this week. ",

Because is state owned, the chances of they went bankrupt is minimal. And yet, in only 1 week, after the president was threatened with inpeachment, the stocks of PB valued 47%.Like I said before, I dont know jack shit about the market, but Im willing to learn at least the basics.\n\nI have never written any handbooks before so it is better for me first to get a feeling of how much you as a reader know (e.g. do you know what a stock is?) so I know where to start. I think it is better for me to adjust the information for the reader, so please, tell me what you want to know. If you want, you can send me a zeromail explaining what you want to know, and I will try to take that into account when I write my \"handbook\" (in a lack of a beter word).",

I consider myself a complete newbie to this, who is more than willing to learn [...]\n> [razkal](#comment_3_12tEAXYqJfqDRP7ZHY1T6fDp67PopmYzYp): I dont know how to send emails through here yet so [...]\n\nOkay, I understand, and I think I have a good (actually a great) solution. I have started to sketch the first three posts. They will be very basic, and I will really try to write them as accessible as possible and not take for granted that the reader understands all financial terms, linguistics and jargons. I think it is important that the reader understand my point of view, how I operate so I will intertwine that aspect into the text. So keep an eye open this week for the first post, I think it will be interesting and a good starting point if you are new to finance. ",

When you see stocks going up and down, or even entire sotck markets like NASDAQ going up and down and says that the stocks went up today 1,25%, them on the next day, it goes up another 0,8%. On the third day, it goes down 3%. Those percentages are compared to the day before, to a specific day of the week ( or month, or year) or what?I know it must be basic, but It had to be asked.\n\nI am happy to answer your questions!\nThe percentage change is  based on yesterdays closing price. What it means is that yesterdays closing price/value will be the todays 100% value of the stock. So to give you an example: If the stock close at $100 at Day 1 and dropps to $97 at Day 2 that is a 3% dropp. BUT, for the third day, it uses Day2's closing price because it is now the new 100% value of the stock. To sum it up, any change in the stock price today is relative to  yesterdays closing price.",

If you guys dont work in %, them I will just drop this and stick with the real value in currency.\n\nIt had a 2% increase. About your second question, there is a difference between when we talk about \"the economy\" and \"the market(s)\". The economy is the country or a region's economy (e.g. South America). They usually measure the growth of an economy as a GDP. Then there is \"the market(s)\" that includes all the financial markets, such as the stock market, commodities market, etc.(e.g. when they speak about BOVESPA). If they use money as a measurement of the markets, they are probably talking about the entire index value. The index value is calculated on a daily basis. This calculation is the sum of the value of each company in the index. Do you understand, if not, keep on asking.",

The socialist goverment is about to be impeach and this may be a good time to buy stocks from Petrobras. But Im not sure if the stocks will go up after she get out of power because investors where projecting about 1,5 billion in deficit this quarter, but it end up being 35 billion. Its state owned tho, so bankrupcy is not a option, I suppose.\n\nI am not too familiar with Petrobras and far from an expert. I am, overall, very restricted when it comes to commodities and energy investments, especially now when the oil price is low, and Iran is going to be a new big export player in the industry. Also, from what I have read in the news the last couple of weeks, the risk has increased, and the potential downside is too big for my risk/reward preference. I am refereeing to the well-known corruption scandal. Yes, everyone knows about it, but the effects can become devastating for small investors and the stock price as big pension funds may reject the company's stock due to their investment rules (big pension funds are talking about putting Petrobras on \"suspension lists\"). Petrobras have also announced that they **1)** want to sell off some of their oil and gas fields,  **2)** are going to reduce its investments with 20% in the next five years, which is not a good indicator.\n\nI am not an expert in Petrobras, but I would not invest in them. However, it is well-known quote: \"Buy When There's Blood In The Streets\", well, that may apply here, so,  if you think it is a good idea, maybe just invest a very **small** amount of money. If Petrobras actually make it and pull it off, then you can \"scale in\" in the company and buy a small chunk of shares over a period of time. I recommend you to **not** invest an amount of money you cannot afford to lose,  especially at this stage. ",
