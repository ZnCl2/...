One thing I would add is that there is an ongoing paradigm shift from blindly trusting with child-like naivety to self-sovereignty in all respects ie. control your keys :) The internet will be no different. \n\nThere have been teething problems but technology such as Namecoin is developing consistently. Zeronet has offered a playground for its use for some time and there will be other projects that embrace it as well.\n\nA key point is that the cheap price of Namecoin is an issue insofar that people do not value what a .bit is offering. This will change with time. ",
