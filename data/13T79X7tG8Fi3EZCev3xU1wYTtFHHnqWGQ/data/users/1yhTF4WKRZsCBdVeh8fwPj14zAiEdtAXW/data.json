The best is to create a website on Zeronet for linking to qBitTorrent posts.\n\nWhat do you think of that? In general, is there much ability to use different networks/protocols for different problems like this? Something resembling the \"UNIX Philosophy\" but applied to the internet instead of pipeline components.",
