See more at my blog [http://mininghere.com](http://mininghere.com).\n###BURST coins\nIn September I found a new way to mine: BURSTs are mined with simple computers and large hard disks. I jumped on that and have now several hard disks mining for me. Too less for a living now, but at least these 20 TB USB-3.0 pay my entire power bill per month.\nIf you want to know more about BURST mining go to \n[http://mininghere.com/2014/11/13/why-burst-mining-is-also-for-you/ ](http://mininghere.com/2014/11/13/why-burst-mining-is-also-for-you/)\n\n###Conclusion\nUse your pc and add hard disks as you can afford it. Let the system mine! Let your office computers over night / weekend on and mine. You will be amazed how much you earn, just by doing that.\n####.\nFor better performance we recommend to use our mining pool at [http://mininghere.com:8001](http://mininghere.com:8001)\n\nIf you got some questions, use **BitMessages**.
