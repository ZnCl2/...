		<p><h1>20210226</h1></p>
		<p><h4><i>song: "clientele" by boocanan</i></h4></p>
		<p>there is a running joke in solstice's diary that goes, "so i haven't written in this diary for a while." started to chronicle her adventures in the occult, written in ferociously the first few months, and then repeatedly abandoned every time the effort of overcoming chronic fatigue overcomes the need to chronicle the wild rides of three in the morning. i used to chastise her for it. you need to create something. something, <em>anything</em>, to prove you existed.</p>
		<p>and now i guess the joke is on me. for i've somehow managed to be absent for four months. four long months subsumed into solstice, blissful in the duality of being and not being at the same time.</p>
		<p><a href="../2019/0708.html">a year and a half ago</a>, i tried to ride my bike. i was still back at the zaibatsu back then. the admin was a bike enthusiast. i had wanted to impress him. and so i dug out my bike from the back of the backyard shed, half-deflated tires and all, and tried to ride it down the street.</p>
		<p>i only got to the end of that street before wanting to throw up in duress.</p>
		<p>solstice got a new bike a month ago. she bought it with her "bidenbucks", as she called it. this new one has a motor and a battery and pedal assist, so she doesn't need to press down so hard on the pedals to make it go. we made it all the way to her workplace and back on one charge. even bought some groceries to bring back home (although one of the straps on the tiny backpack she brought with snapped from the weight). my throat burned, but i did not collapse.</p>
		<p>well, i crash-landed into a snowbank once. but that's what i deserve for thinking it was a good idea to ride on an iced-over trail.</p>
		<p>the locals did not laugh at me this time. the locals said "hello" and "i will step aside since the grass is hard to ride on" and "damn, it's a nice day outside today."</p>
		<p>i did not collapse in my room.</p>
		<p>the shadows did not dance on my floor. although they sauntered in the kitchen, announcing the arrival of my father's dog, about to beg me for some crushed ice from the fridge.</p>
		<p>you used to drive every day, luna. although i never knew it until the day we had to make a run for it. how many times did i survey the parking lot come evening break and see your motorcycle in the far corner, shrouded in a rain cover, and assumed it belonged to an overenthusiastic customer? to an employee with a family, with children, with a life of their own outside the workplace? you would disappear for a few hours at the end of your shift, you confessed. you wanted to watch the sunrise. you wanted to witness the last vestige of a world yet unbranded.</p>
		<p>you wanted to watch the fire spill over the land and purify everything in the flame.</p>
		<p>and as i play with my mother's candles late at night, luna, i stick my hand above the flickering light and convince myself i am feeling the heat of your convictions.</p>
