As I dug deeper and deeper I realized what was so special _(hint: it isn't the blockchain dummy)._ Decentralization is the name of the game _(which is why I find all the corporate blockchain talk so funny...but then even politics makes me laugh so I guess I have a weird sense of humor)._\n\nSo...this year I'm dusting off the C++ skills, pythonic powers, and other mostly seasoned open source tools and getting my hands dirty with decentralization:\n\n1.  Simplify multi-sig address usage in iOS-based Bitcoin wallet apps\n2.  Create a fully functional open-hardware/open-source Bitcoin ATM\n3.  Create an iOS-based ZeroNet browser\n4.  Flesh out a plugin system for ZeroNet\n5.  Release Contre.bit (a decentralized chess game system with Bitcoin payouts)\n6.  Release ZeroPress a decentralized blogging engine"
