As far as I'm concerned all the changes are for the better.\n\nDidn't realize there was an anime of it, but can't say I'm surprised. The game was pretty good, though I thought the combat was a little too loose.",

Now Kado, that's a CGI anime done right.\n> But seriously, watch Kado. The show is a great Thinking-man's Sci-fi aimed at Adults, and it's from Toei of all companies.\n\nThanks for the heads up Kado. I haven't really been watching much new anime lately, unless you count Persona 5's cutscenes. You know, I watched a pretty decent youtube video on some of Berserk's quality issues that was pretty decent (not just the usual boring rant). I have to say, I still enjoy it, mostly because I enjoy the voice acting so much. I definitely noticed some animation issues in season 2 that I didn't notice in the first. I love Berserk and I don't really think the animation is that bad, it's heavily stylized, anyway. But I definitely get why some people aren't into it.",
