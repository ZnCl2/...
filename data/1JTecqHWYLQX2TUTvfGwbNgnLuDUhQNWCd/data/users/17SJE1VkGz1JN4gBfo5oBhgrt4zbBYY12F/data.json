The first is very good and the second also is good, but short. I like the idea of the Liminality series, it can be even better then SIGN. Another .Hack:// series I haven't watched yet. By many opinions on the internet I decided than another .Hack:// animes is not so good. And I haven't played games because I don't play games and I cannot even run games on my linux PC. Perfect .Hack://Sign soundtrack by Yuki Kajiura I still listen till present moment.",
