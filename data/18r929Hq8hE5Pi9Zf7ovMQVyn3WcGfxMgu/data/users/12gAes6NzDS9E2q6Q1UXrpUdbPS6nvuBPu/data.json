It should be right next to the \"Comment\" button.\n\nAlso, technically you can edit other's comments because you are the owner of the repo. This is why the owner of the repo can see the edit button on all comments (in the top right corner of each).\n\nHowever, if you are on Linux, these icons may not be showing up (I've had problems with this on Linux only, Windows seems to be fine for me)",
