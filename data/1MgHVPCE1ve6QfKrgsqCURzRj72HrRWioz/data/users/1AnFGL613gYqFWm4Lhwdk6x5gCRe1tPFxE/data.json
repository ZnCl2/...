By YouTube or a third party.\n\nThat way, everyone gets paid by their viewers in proportion of how much time the viewer spent watching their videos.\n\nYou may say - but what about those animators that produce short content vs someone who makes 20 minute rants?\n\nWell, how about you choose the default way of dividing up your contribution yourself, how does that sound?\n\nThe user would decide how much to divide each month (say 1 usd), and then they would have options about how to divide it:\n\neach video gets amount equivalent to how much time you spend it it\neach video gets amount equivalent to how much time you spend it it + 2x boost if you liked it\nonly reward videos you liked\nonly reward videos you liked + videos by authors you're subscribed to\nOr even another model, it only has to sound fair to you, since you're the one who is willing to part with the money. But it has to be semi, or fully automated.\n\nYou don't even have to pay for anything, I would still keep the free option, or even give users the ability to spend less than a dollar monthly contributing to the creators.\n\nAnd for the left-minded, you could choose a model that gives more to the small channels and less to the big ones. I watch smaller channels way more than the big ones so its not really an issue for me.\n\n","language":"text/plain","encrypted":false,"added":1516830621}],"comment":[]}
