Enjoy!\nPardon the BB code and ahref inserts\n\n<blockquote>Reminder for all that 9 out of 10 times, the people who make a shitstorm about morality and ethics are the same people who don't abide by them and actually do worse things.\n\nThis number increases to 10/10 with anti-pirate collectives as they have been observed and proven in these past few years of:\n\n1. Warner/Chappell <a href=” https://torrentfreak.com/warner-pays-14-million-for-illegitimate-happy-birthday-claims-160210/”>setting aside $14 million for legal settlements after claiming damages and aggressively pursuing those who used the \"Happy Birthday\" song in public</a>. With a settlement amount being a tiny fraction of how much revenue was generated by claiming false copyrights, all while deterring restaurants from singing the song on a child’s birthday, due to the fear of being sued. aka Copyright Innovation.\n2. Portugal placing a <a href=\"https://torrentfreak.com/non-existent-pirate-site-added-to-national-blocklist-160210/\">non-existing website on it's national website block list</a> at their tax-payers expense.\n3.

Sentencing a young adult to a debtors prison when he is <a href=\"http://torrentfreak.com/surfthechannel-admin-facing-jail-again-over-unpaid-piracy-debt-150608/\">unable to pay his copyright infringement fine</a>, placing his life in ruin and forcing taxpayers to foot the bill for the benefit of a multi-million dollar industry.\n10.

			"body": "I carried this around in a text file until I memorized it. But for those who are unaware, if you have the infohash of a torrent,\nyou can create your own magnet link simply by using the template of:\n\nmagnet:?xt=urn:btih:INFOHASH\n\nSimply replace the INFOHASH with the Info Hash of the Torrent you would like. Data is pulled from DHT so no tracker needed.\n\nExample:\nThe infohash for one of the TPB-AFK is 411A7A164505636AB1A8276395B375A3A30BFF32\nSo to create a magnet for this torrent we simply make our own link then paste it into our torrent client or browser.\n\nmagnet:?xt=urn:btih:INFOHASH\n(becomes)\nmagnet:?xt=urn:btih:411A7A164505636AB1A8276395B375A3A30BFF32\n\nSo simple anyone can do it. =)",
