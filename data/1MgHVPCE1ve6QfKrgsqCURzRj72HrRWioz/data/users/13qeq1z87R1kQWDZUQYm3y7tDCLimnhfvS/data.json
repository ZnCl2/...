			"body": "ORIGINALLY FROM: http://www.gnu.org/fun/jokes/know.your.sysadmin\nPLS ENJOY (AND DON'T CALL GNU/LINUX LINUX)\n\nHello,\n\nCouldn't find that in the humour page... it's old, but still good...\n\n---\n  Durval Menezes.\n\n\nKnow your Unix System Administrator\n\n                                               (a field guide)\n\n\n\n                             There are four major species of Unix sysad:\n\n 1.The TECHNICAL THUG. Usually a systems programmer who has been forced\ninto system\n     administration; writes scripts in a polyglot of the Bourne shell,\nsed, C, awk, perl, and APL.\n 2.The ADMINISTRATIVE FASCIST. Usually a retentive drone (or rarely, a\nharridan\n     ex-secretary) who has been forced into system administration.\n 3.The MANIAC. Usually an aging cracker who discovered that neither the\nMossad nor Cuba are\n     willing to pay a living wage for computer espionage. Fell into\nsystem administration;\n     occasionally approaches major competitors with indesp schemes.\n 4.The IDIOT. Usually a cretin, morpohodite, or old COBOL programmer\nselected to be the\n     system administrator by a committee of cretins, morphodites, and\nold COBOL programmers.\n\n\n\n                  HOW TO IDENTIFY YOUR SYSTEM ADMINISTRATOR:\n\n                                     SITUATION: Low disk space.\n\nTECHNICAL THUG: Writes a suite of scripts to monitor disk usage,\nmaintain a database of\nhistoric disk usage, predict future disk usage via least squares\nregression analysis, identify users\nwho are more than a standard deviation over the mean, and send mail to\nthe offending parties.\nPlaces script in cron. Disk usage does not change, since disk-hogs, by\nnature, either ignore\nscript-generated mail, or file it away in triplicate.\n\nADMINISTRATIVE FASCIST: Puts disk usage policy in motd. Uses disk\nquotas. Allows no\nexceptions, thus crippling development work. Locks accounts that go over\nquota.\n\nMANIAC:\n\n        # cd /home\n        # rm -rf `du -s * | sort -rn | head -1 | awk '{print $2}'`;\n\nIDIOT:\n\n        # cd /home\n        # cat `du -s * | sort -rn | head -1 | awk '{ printf \"%s/*\\n\",\n$2}'` | compress\n\n\n\n                                  SITUATION: Excessive CPU usage\n\nTECHNICAL THUG: Writes a suite of scripts to monitor processes, maintain\na database of CPU\nusage, identify processes more than a standard deviation over the norm,\nand renice offending\nprocesses. Places script in cron. Ends up renicing the production\ndatabase into oblivion, bringing\noperations to a grinding halt, much to the delight of the xtrek freaks.\n\nADMINISTRATIVE FASCIST: Puts CPU usage policy in motd. Uses CPU quotas.\nLocks\naccounts that go over quota. Allows no exceptions, thus crippling\ndevelopment work, much to the\ndelight of the xtrek freaks.\n\nMANIAC:\n\n        # kill -9 `ps -augxww | sort -rn +8 -9  | head -1 | awk '{print\n$2}'`\n\nIDIOT:\n\n        # compress -f `ps -augxww | sort -rn +8 -9  | head -1 | awk\n'{print $2}'`\n\n\n\n                                 SITUATION: New account creation.\n\nTECHNICAL THUG: Writes perl script that creates home directory, copies\nin incomprehensible\ndefault environment, and places entries in /etc/passwd, /etc/shadow, and\n/etc/group. (By hand,\nNOT with passmgmt.) Slaps on setuid bit; tells a nearby secretary to\nhandle new accounts. Usually,\nsaid secretary is still dithering over the difference between 'enter'\nand 'return'; and so, no new\naccounts are ever created.\n\nADMINISTRATIVE FASCIST: Puts new account policy in motd. Since people\nwithout accounts\ncannot read the motd, nobody ever fulfills the bureaucratic\nrequirements; and so, no new accounts\nare ever created.\n\nMANIAC: \"If you're too stupid to break in and create your own account, I\ndon't want you on the\nsystem. We've got too many goddamn sh*t-for-brains a**holes on this box\nanyway.\"\n\nIDIOT:\n\n    # cd /home; mkdir \"Bob's home directory\"\n    # echo \"Bob Simon:gandalf:0:0::/dev/tty:compress -f\" > /etc/passwd\n\n\n\n                                     SITUATION: Root disk fails\n\nTECHNICAL THUG: Repairs drive. Usually is able to repair filesystem from\nboot monitor. Failing\nthat, front-panel toggles microkernel in and starts script on\nneighboring machine to load binary\nboot code into broken machine, reformat and reinstall OS. Lets it run\nover the weekend while he\ngoes mountain climbing.\n\nADMINISTRATIVE FASCIST: Begins investigation to determine who broke the\ndrive. Refuses to\nfix system until culprit is identified and charged for the equipment.\n\nMANIAC, LARGE SYSTEM: Rips drive from system, uses sledgehammer to smash\nsame to\nflinders. Calls manufacturer, threatens pets. Abuses field engineer\nwhile they put in a new drive and\nreinstall the OS.\n\nMANIAC, SMALL SYSTEM: Rips drive from system, uses ball-peen hammer to\nsmash same to\nflinders. Calls Requisitions, threatens pets. Abuses bystanders while\nputting in new drive and\nreinstalling OS.\n\nIDIOT: Doesn't notice anything wrong.\n\n\n\n                                SITUATION: Poor network response.\n\nTECHNICAL THUG: Writes scripts to monitor network, then rewires entire\nmachine room,\nimproving response time by 2%. Shrugs shoulders, says, \"I've done all I\ncan do,\" and goes\nmountain climbing.\n\nADMINISTRATIVE FASCIST: Puts network usage policy in motd. Calls up\nBerkeley and AT&T,\nbadgers whoever answers for network quotas. Tries to get xtrek freaks\nfired.\n\nMANIAC: Every two hours, pulls ethernet cable from wall and waits for\nconnections to time out.\n\nIDIOT:\n\n    # compress -f /dev/en0\n\n\n\n                                     SITUATION: User questions\n\nTECHNICAL THUG: Hacks the code of emacs' doctor-mode to answer new users\nquestions.\nDoesn't bother to tell people how to start the new \"guru-mode\", or for\nthat matter, emacs.\n\nADMINISTRATIVE FASCIST: Puts user support policy in motd. Maintains\nqueue of questions.\nAnswers them when he gets a chance, often within two weeks of receipt of\nthe proper form.\n\nMANIAC: Screams at users until they go away. Sometimes barters knowledge\nfor powerful drink\nand/or sycophantic adulation.\n\nIDIOT: Answers all questions to best of his knowledge until the user\nrealizes few UNIX systems\nsupport punched cards or JCL.\n\n\n\n                                          Stupid user questions\n\nTECHNICAL THUG: Answers question in hex, binary, postfix, and/or French\nuntil user gives up\nand goes away.\n\nADMINISTRATIVE FASCIST: Locks user's account until user can present\ndocumentation\ndemonstrating their qualification to use the machine.\n\nMANIAC:\n\n    # cat > > ~luser/.cshrc\n    alias vi 'rm \\!*;unalias vi;grep -v BoZo ~/.cshrc > ~/.z; mv -f ~/.z\n~/.cshrc'\n    ^D\n\nIDIOT: Answers all questions to best of his knowledge. Recruits user to\nsystem administration\nteam.\n\n\n\n                           SITUATION: Process accounting management\n\nTECHNICAL THUG: Ignores packaged accounting software; trusts scripts to\nsniff out any\nproblems & compute charges.\n\nADMINISTRATIVE FASCIST: Devotes 75% of disk space to accounting records\nowned by root\nand chmod'ed 000.\n\nMANIAC: Laughs fool head off at very mention of accounting.\n\nIDIOT:\n\n    # lpr /etc/wtmp /usr/adm/paact\n\n\n\n                           SITUATION: Religious war, BSD vs. System V\n\nTECHNICAL THUG: BSD. Crippled on System V boxes.\n\nADMINISTRATIVE FASCIST: System V. Horrified by the people who use BSD.\nPlaces frequent\ncalls to DEA.\n\nMANIAC: Prefers BSD, but doesn't care as long as HIS processes run\nquickly.\n\nIDIOT:\n\n    # cd c:\n\n\n\n                           SITUATION: Religious war, System V vs. AIX\n\nTECHNICAL THUG: Weeps.\n\nADMINISTRATIVE FASCIST: AIX-- doesn't much care for the OS, but loves\nthe jackboots.\n\nMANIAC: System V, but keeps AIX skills up, knowing full well how much\nBig Financial\nInstitutions love IBM...\n\nIDIOT: AIX.\n\n\n\n                                SITUATION: Balky printer daemons.\n\nTECHNICAL THUG: Rewrites lpd in FORTH.\n\nADMINISTRATIVE FASCIST: Puts printer use policy in motd. Calls customer\nsupport every time\nthe printer freezes. Tries to get user who submitted the most recent job\nfired.\n\nMANIAC: Writes script that kills all the daemons, clears all the print\nqueues, and maybe restarts\nthe daemons. Runs it once a hour from cron.\n\nIDIOT:\n\n    # kill -9 /dev/lp ; /dev/lp &\n\n\n\n                                       SITUATION: OS upgrade\n\nTECHNICAL THUG: Reads source code of new release, takes only what he\nlikes.\n\nADMINISTRATIVE FASCIST: Instigates lawsuit against the vendor for having\nshipped a product\nwith bugs in it in the first place.\n\nMANIAC:\n\n    # uptime\n    1:33pm  up 19 days, 22:49,  167 users,  load average: 6.49, 6.45,\n6.31\n    # wall\n    Well, it's upgrade time.  Should take a few hours.  And good luck on\nthat\n    5:00 deadline, guys!  We're all pulling for you!\n    ^D\n\nIDIOT:\n\n    # dd if=/dev/rmt8 of=/vmunix\n\n\n\n                                        SITUATION: Balky mail\n\nTECHNICAL THUG: Rewrites sendmail.cf from scratch. Rewrites sendmail in\nSNOBOL. Hacks\nkernel to implement file locking. Hacks kernel to implement \"better\"\nsemaphores. Rewrites\nsendmail in assembly. Hacks kernel to . . .\n\nADMINISTRATIVE FASCIST: Puts mail use policy in motd. Locks accounts\nthat go over mail use\nquota. Keeps quota low enough that people go back to interoffice mail,\nthus solving problem.\n\nMANIAC:\n\n    # kill -9 `ps -augxww | grep sendmail | awk '{print $2}'`\n    # rm -f /usr/spool/mail/*\n    # wall\n    Mail is down.  Please use interoffice mail until we have it back up.\n\n    ^D\n    # write max\n    I've got my boots and backpack.  Ready to leave for Mount Tam?\n    ^D\n\nIDIOT:\n\n    # echo \"HELP!\" | mail\ntech_support.AT.vendor.com%kremvax%bitnet!BIFF!!!\n\n\n\n                          SITUATION: Users want phone list application\n\nTECHNICAL THUG: Writes RDBMS in perl and Smalltalk. Users give up and go\nback to post-it\nnotes.\n\nADMINISTRATIVE FASCIST: Oracle. Users give up and go back to post-it\nnotes.\n\nMANIAC: Tells the users to use flat files and grep, the way God meant\nman to keep track of phone\nnumbers. Users give up and go back to post-it notes.\n\nIDIOT:\n\n    % dd ibs=80 if=/dev/rdisk001s7 | grep \"Fred\"\n\n\n\n                                        OTHER GUIDELINES\n\n                                    TYPICAL ROOT .cshrc FILE:\n\nTECHNICAL THUG: Longer than eight kilobytes.
