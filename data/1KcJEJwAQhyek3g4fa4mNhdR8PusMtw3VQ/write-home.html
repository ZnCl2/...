I was looking around <A HREF='https://www.reddit.com/' TARGET='_blank'>reddit</A> a few weeks ago, when I came across a sub-reddit called <A HREF='https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/' TARGET='_blank'>WritingPrompts</A>. here people were either starting short stories or adding to them, often with hilarious results. As the structure of reddit didn't really lend it's self to this kind of writing, I decided to write one <A HREF='http://write.si7.eu/' TARGET='_blank'>Here</A>, I would like to port it to ZeroNet in the near future.<P>

Users of this system can add more sections to any story, they can also create a new story.<P>
