v2.1
-----
+ Added adaptive UI support (the UI now adapts depending on the content being shown - e.g. a torrent with just a photo will have the photo in its own tailored UI rather than just being forced into a small album art box)
+ Added support for standalone photo and video torrents that have just one photo or video.
+ Created an "immersive experience" - the album art is used as the page's background which is then passed through some filters (including opacity, saturation, brightness, etc... done hardware accelerated on the GPU). The same thing also applies for torrents that contain a video and a photo - the photo is used as album art, the audio from the video for the music track and the picture from the video as the dynamic immersive background that changes perfectly in sync with the music.
+ A dedicated custom pause/play toggle button has been added for files that contain audio streams without any visible music controls
+ The cursor now reflects the current action in the player - if the player is loading the torrent, the cursor will be a "background loading" one. When everything's finished loading or the file's streaming, the cursor goes back to normal
+ Added aliases for audioFile and audioFileID (being file and fileID respectively)
+ Added a meta no-referrer for better privacy
