v2.4
-----
+* Made the UI scale much better on mobile and tablet devices
* Fixed a bug where if an audio file or an audio file + picture was provided, the "Waiting for torrent metadata" loading message would still appear even after the whole torrent has finished downloading
* Fixed a bug where audio files weren't properly handled, resulting in the player's shadow being outward instead of inward if both an audio file and a photo was provided. (see before-audio-fix.png and after-audio-fix.png in changes folder for comparison)
* Further improved mobile scaling
+ Added a "popout miniplayer" feature. This allows you to pop out a miniplayer that is around the size of an average smartphone screen 
+ Added QR code feature that allows you to easily share QR codes that others can scan rather than needing to manually send or type out a long infohash
+ Added a basic YouTube fallback for when WebRTC is not supported or an infohash is not specified. Please note that this does not work with VEVO music yet.

v2.3
-----
+ Added playlist support by allowing CSV-parsed IDs (e.g. "?ID=infohash1,infohash2,infohash3,...")
* Fixed an issue where clicking a playing video would cause you to be redirected to the homepage
- Removed a tiny bit of redundant code
+ Added basic support for txt, htm and html file streaming
* Switched moment.min.js link to a HTTPS version and integrity check for better security and to eliminate mixed content errors
+ moment.min.js now loads asynchronously for slightly improved performance.
+ Added upload support - simply drag a file or even a group of files anywhere onto the page simulaneously and you'll get a share link that you can share with anyone - they just click the link and it starts playing.
* Cleaned up the formatting of the js files. Rather than an inconsistent mix of spaces, tabs and even the amount of spaces and tabs being mixed for indentation, it's now all consistent and solely tabs
+ Added support for PDF documents
+* Made the example links functional on the welcome page and error message tips

v2.2
-----
* Fixed broken image scaling (if you provided an infohash whos torrent only contained an image, sometimes the image would cut off the screen and enlarge too much, especially if the provided image's aspect ratio isn't similar to your browser window's aspect ratio - That bug is now fixed.)
+ Added crossorigin="anonymous" to external script references for better privacy and security
- Support for full magnet links (using the URL args ?file= and ?audioFile= ) are no longer supported so that multiple URL args can be easily specified and to allow for new features
+ Added support for specifying it an audio/video clip autoplays or not using the optional URL arg "&autoplay=no". By default, the streamer will autoplay content unless you specify "&autoplay=no" in the URL.
+ Added the URL arg "?ID=" for cross-compatibility with Bwoi Music.
+ FLAC files are now recognised as audio files and will attempt to be played in supported browsers
+ The page's title is now dynamic and will now tell you what's being streamed
* Improved photo filename parsing and formatting to match the parser used for audio and video filenames
+ Added track time to custom audio controls (the ones that show up when a video and photo is supplied in a torrent and the video's picture is used for the bg and the video's audio is used for the music, and is controlled by the custom audio controls). You can now see the current track time and total track duration beside the pause/play button.
* The cursor now changes from "progress" back to "auto" if no ID is specified
* Updated the examples when no ID is specified to use IDs rather than audioFile args
* The loading message no longer shows up when no ID is specified
* The upload and download indicators now hide when no data is being transfered
+ The peers indicator now shows a more user-friendly message when no other peers are seeding the file anymore
+- Removed the logo link on the top left of the page and instead made it show up when the album art is loading. If no album art is found after the whole torrent is done downloading, the original "No album art found" placeholder will appear and replace the logo. You can still click the NinjaBeats logo to take you back to the homepage.
* The same amount of blur is applied to images and videos - images no longer blur more than videos.

v2.1
-----
+ Added adaptive UI support (the UI now adapts depending on the content being shown - e.g. a torrent with just a photo will have the photo in its own tailored UI rather than just being forced into a small album art box)
+ Added support for standalone photo and video torrents that have just one photo or video.
+ Created an "immersive experience" - the album art is used as the page's background which is then passed through some filters (including opacity, saturation, brightness, etc... done hardware accelerated on the GPU). The same thing also applies for torrents that contain a video and a photo - the photo is used as album art, the audio from the video for the music track and the picture from the video as the dynamic immersive background that changes perfectly in sync with the music.
+ A dedicated custom pause/play toggle button has been added for files that contain audio streams without any visible music controls
+ The cursor now reflects the current action in the player - if the player is loading the torrent, the cursor will be a "background loading" one. When everything's finished loading or the file's streaming, the cursor goes back to normal
+ Added aliases for audioFile and audioFileID (being file and fileID respectively)
+ Added a meta no-referrer for better privacy
