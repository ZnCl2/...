v2.2
-----
* Fixed broken image scaling (if you provided an infohash whos torrent only contained an image, sometimes the image would cut off the screen and enlarge too much, especially if the provided image's aspect ratio isn't similar to your browser window's aspect ratio - That bug is now fixed.)
+ Added crossorigin="anonymous" to external script references for better privacy and security
- Support for full magnet links (using the URL args ?file= and ?audioFile= ) are no longer supported so that multiple URL args can be easily specified and to allow for new features
+ Added support for specifying it an audio/video clip autoplays or not using the optional URL arg "&autoplay=no". By default, the streamer will autoplay content unless you specify "&autoplay=no" in the URL.
+ Added the URL arg "?ID=" for cross-compatibility with Bwoi Music.
+ FLAC files are now recognised as audio files and will attempt to be played in supported browsers
+ The page's title is now dynamic and will now tell you what's being streamed
* Improved photo filename parsing and formatting to match the parser used for audio and video filenames
+ Added track time to custom audio controls (the ones that show up when a video and photo is supplied in a torrent and the video's picture is used for the bg and the video's audio is used for the music, and is controlled by the custom audio controls). You can now see the current track time and total track duration beside the pause/play button.
* The cursor now changes from "progress" back to "auto" if no ID is specified
* Updated the examples when no ID is specified to use IDs rather than audioFile args
* The loading message no longer shows up when no ID is specified
* The upload and download indicators now hide when no data is being transfered
+ The peers indicator now shows a more user-friendly message when no other peers are seeding the file anymore
+- Removed the logo link on the top left of the page and instead made it show up when the album art is loading. If no album art is found after the whole torrent is done downloading, the original "No album art found" placeholder will appear and replace the logo. You can still click the NinjaBeats logo to take you back to the homepage.
* The same amount of blur is applied to images and videos - images no longer blur more than videos.

v2.1
-----
+ Added adaptive UI support (the UI now adapts depending on the content being shown - e.g. a torrent with just a photo will have the photo in its own tailored UI rather than just being forced into a small album art box)
+ Added support for standalone photo and video torrents that have just one photo or video.
+ Created an "immersive experience" - the album art is used as the page's background which is then passed through some filters (including opacity, saturation, brightness, etc... done hardware accelerated on the GPU). The same thing also applies for torrents that contain a video and a photo - the photo is used as album art, the audio from the video for the music track and the picture from the video as the dynamic immersive background that changes perfectly in sync with the music.
+ A dedicated custom pause/play toggle button has been added for files that contain audio streams without any visible music controls
+ The cursor now reflects the current action in the player - if the player is loading the torrent, the cursor will be a "background loading" one. When everything's finished loading or the file's streaming, the cursor goes back to normal
+ Added aliases for audioFile and audioFileID (being file and fileID respectively)
+ Added a meta no-referrer for better privacy
