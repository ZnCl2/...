Just compare the number of unique words with the number of entire words by echo "$spam_post" | sed 's/[ \.,]/\n/g' | sort | uniq | wc -l vs echo "$spam_post" | sed 's/[ \.,]/\n/g' | wc -l.
.
This gives:
33 vs 206 for the previous shit-guy's comment.
16 vs 342 for the previous-previous one.
.
206/33 = 6.24
342/16 = 21.38
.
That is, the previous-previous one is more spamable than the previous one.
.
In other hand, your current comment gives 26/24 = 1.08.
It means, your comment is very low score to be called spam.
.
This works like a charm~!
.
But, this will not work forever if they notice this and change the strategy.
