			<h2>Some updates (February the 4th, 2019)</h2>
			<p>I made a change a while ago which now makes fetched and unfetched magnet hashes disjoint. This means that downloading the SkyTorrents hashes will not give you the urls in SkyTorrents URI. The biggest reason this was done was to create a more automated script, able to go to the next file after it's done trying to fetch all magnet hashes in one file. Removing the fetched hashes also means there's no need to ever fetch anything twice, and crashes do not cause loss of time and work.</p>
			<p>I could make a version of the script which would continually cycle between the files and just try and try again until all hashes were fetched, but I don't have a computer I could use for such a purpose. For anyone who needs the entire original dump, it's located </a href="http://127.0.0.1:43110/1J1epG5eMc4bsmh69UctBg4PHEe5B3kYHY/files/complete_listing.txt.gz">here</a></p>
			<p>I also removed childchan from my sites, because I didn't like what it turned into. Incidentally, that means childchan can never be taken down or censored, as I am no longer in possession of its private key.</p>

			<h2>The future of the SkyTorrents dump (March the 13th, 2018)</h2>
			<p>I have been fetching the first three parts of the 302 files of 50000 magnet URI hashes, which is quite a lengthy process. Using a timeout of ten minutes, running 100 torrents, fetching 50000 magnet hashes takes more than 83 hours. Even after finishing, there will always exist yet unfetched hashes. There should be more people fetching the hashes, and the unfetched hashes should be available for anyone wanting to try to fetch them again. The fetched magnet links need a new home. With over 16000 currently fetched magnet links, my browser is already dying by loading them all at once.</p>
			<p>The finished magnet URI should be put into a searchable torrent database. I have no experience with replacing a back-end with a front-end (which is why there is no javascript here), so this is a job for the javascript developers out there. Preferably, users should be able to vote on the legitimacy of a magnet link. Any magnet link with, say, 10 downvotes per 1 upvote, should be purged (to get rid of viruses, and non-legit magnet links). A magnet link with no description should be editable by anyone (or one would need assignees). Users should be able to choose which category any magnet link belongs to. This would take a lot of work away from the developers, and to the consumers. Given enough time, we would have a nice index of magnet links.</p>
			<p>I am a bit worried about the risk for whoever is fetching the hashes. It seems the hashes include fake CP; a video telling you the police now has your ip address. While my script will no longer download such content (see <a href="http://127.0.0.1:43110/Talk.ZeroNetwork.bit/?Topic:1519627708_1M8ZpJwd63Vb8KdVaSb5EbqKxoRTVDmqTf/Save+SkyTorrents" target="_blank">the discussion thread</a>), I do not know if simply fetching the metadata could get people into trouble. Those torrents do not contain any illegal content, which implies just starting the torrent could be incriminating. I do not see myself at risk of having my real IP exposed, but others could potentially get in trouble.</p>

			<h2>Some thoughts about ZeroNet (March the 3rd, 2018)</h2>
			<p>I like how ZeroNet has started branching out with all kinds of services. I can find music, movies, entertaining videos, books, games, forums, imageboards, interesting tools, articles and porn, all contained within the decentralized network.</p>
			<p>I kind of dislike whenever people are linking to places like YouTube, or using external scripts. We are here to escape from the centralized services, not to have a decentralized community revolving around the centralized services.</p>
			<p>There is still a problem with many files not having enough peers. We should have seedboxes, hosting all available files, placed in different countries. Some seedboxes should be fully uncensored, while others could follow a blacklist based on laws in the country where the seedbox is placed. This would ensure most files to stay available in the case of a police raid, or a simiar event.</p>
			<p>While a popular ZeroNet file could never be removed (without the keys of whoever uploaded the file or the person who made the site), less popular files will easily die off. Over time, we might want to let some files die off, because they take up too much storage or nobody really likes them. Seedboxes could have a set peers per age configuration, deleting really old files with few peers.</p>
			<p>Sites like KopyKate are especially in need of seedboxes. Many files seem to have died already. Because it has more than 230GB of files, and that number will only increase, it can't be hosted by a normal user. Some Raspberry Pi with external HDDs running ZeroNet and a ZeroNet-only crawler, always downloading all files from each site, should be enough.</p>
