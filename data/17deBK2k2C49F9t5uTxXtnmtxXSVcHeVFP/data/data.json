Here are some ways to create the materials you need for a beautiful, organic, productive garden, by both re-directing household waste, and foraging in your local area. I use a lot of these tricks in my garden to make it almost completely free for me to continue growing new things, and expanding the workable area every year!\n\n# For soil\n\n*   Save your food scraps to create a rich **compost** for growing veggies and amending your soil.

The more you add, the more rich, nutritious material you can make for your garden. I like composting because it means I don’t have gross smelly garbage bags to deal with, because food waste is diverted. It seems like a lot of work at first, but it actually saves time, money, and transportation.\n*   [**Seaweed or kelp** is one of the best things for your garden, with over 70 essential nutrients, and acting as a weed barrier and a moisture-retentive mulch](https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fforums.gardenweb.com%2Fforums%2Fload%2Ftomato%2Fmsg0216222224803.html&t=ZmJiNGMxMDBmNTUzMTljMDdiYzg0ZjczYzI5MWZjZDAzNGY4NWJkNSwxYWdFVDU3cQ%3D%3D&b=t%3AIE0U7aKoLCeGU6ROjrSfZw&p=http%3A%2F%2Fdesireasflux.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F178980312766%2Fcant-afford-to-buy-things-for-your-garden&m=1).

It can be quite expensive and inorganic-looking. Free solutions that both attract worms and can be replaced in small segments as they break down include:_\n\n*   **Newspaper***\n*   **Cardboard***\n*   **Egg cartons***\n*   **Printer paper, looseleaf, etc. in thick layers***\n\n_*try to make sure you are using paper that has vegetable-based dyes, so you aren’t leeching toxins into the soil._\n\n# Soil density/drainage\n\n*   If your soil is compacted and you have plants that require low levels of water, or excellent drainage, add **sand**. I don’t recommend stealing it from the beach, but ask around and you’d be surprised at how easy it is to get for free. **Sawdust** also improves drainage. Adding organic matter and mulch encourages **worms**, who also till and aerate compacted soil.\n*   If the area still needs drainage, dig a hole and fill it with bricks or rocks to create a “[**dry well**](https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wikihow.com%2FFix-Poor-Soil-Drainage&t=NjQ5Y2Y3ODdmODNjNDc4NzQzYjU1YWE1MzFiZGVjNzQ4MGQzNWJlNCwxYWdFVDU3cQ%3D%3D&b=t%3AIE0U7aKoLCeGU6ROjrSfZw&p=http%3A%2F%2Fdesireasflux.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F178980312766%2Fcant-afford-to-buy-things-for-your-garden&m=1)”\n*   For drainage in pots, add **crushed bricks,** **terra cotta pot fragments, packing peanuts, small stones, marbles,** or**sand** to the bottom under the soil layer.

These trees and shrubs are specifically beneficial to Missouri, so please check that they are not invasive species where you live before planting.\n\n**Small Trees: **(Up to 30 ft. tall)\n\n**Downy Hawthorn -** Beneficial to 150 different species\n\n**Downy Serviceberry -**  Beneficial to 119 different species\n\n**Flowering Dogwood -**  Beneficial to 150 different species\n\n**Large Trees: **(Up to 90 ft. tall)\n\n**Shagbark Hickory -**  Beneficial to 200 different species\n\n**Tulip Poplar - ** Beneficial to 368 different species\n\n**White Oak -**  Beneficial to 410 different species\n\n**Shrubs:**\n\n**American Hazelnut -**  Beneficial to 31 different species\n\n**Arrowwood Viburnum -**  Beneficial to 104 different species\n\n**Ninebark -** Beneficial to 40 different species\n\n**Other Beneficial Plants & Trees:**\n\nPin Oak\n\nRough- Leaved Dogwood\n\nOakleaf Hydrangea\n\nPrairie Rose\n\nNot only are the above mentioned trees and shrubs good for butterflies and moths, but they are also beneficial to song birds. An average chickadee clutch can eat 6,000-9,000 caterpillars before leaving the nest. Let’s also not forget that butterflies are pollinators and trees are carbon sinks. The benefits of planting a few shrubs or trees can be pretty big in the long run."

However others pinpoint the invention of trained trees to the 16th century in France and England where apple tree branches were bent horizontally to allow for more fruit production instead of height. You can train fruit trees into several different shapes that grow supported up walls or even into free-stranding living fences.\n\nIf you are interested in reading more, check out the links below:\n\n**[How to Espalier Apple Trees](https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.motherearthnews.com%2Forganic-gardening%2Fespalier-apple-trees-zmaz93onztak&t=ZmE3ZDZlYzE3MTdkNjRhNWI4NTMwMTlmNDRkYjI2NWVmZTVmMGU3MCwwS1NMYmtDWQ%3D%3D&b=t%3AnhRkDqkruKWZoA7CFtIcFA&p=https%3A%2F%2Fsolvoid-lunarpunk.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F179794424296%2Fespalier-finegardening&m=1)**\n\n**[How to Espalier](https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhg.com%2Fgardening%2Ftrees-shrubs-vines%2Fcare%2Fhow-to-espalier%2F&t=OTg5OGY5YmZkNDViYjdjMDYyZTNhMTk4OTExOTVmYzZkOTgyNTgyMCwwS1NMYmtDWQ%3D%3D&b=t%3AnhRkDqkruKWZoA7CFtIcFA&p=https%3A%2F%2Fsolvoid-lunarpunk.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F179794424296%2Fespalier-finegardening&m=1)**\n\n**[Espalier](https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.finegardening.com%2Farticle%2Fespalier&t=ZDA5ZDVlMWJkYjUxNWExNTEzNTQxYzUwN2QzNTg2YTJhNTM4ZmJmNywwS1NMYmtDWQ%3D%3D&b=t%3AnhRkDqkruKWZoA7CFtIcFA&p=https%3A%2F%2Fsolvoid-lunarpunk.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F179794424296%2Fespalier-finegardening&m=1)**\n\n*All links are clearnet!"

If they exist, will it mean that they have trouble surviving? Since their history is so greatly tied to decadence and a very romantic and sometimes bourgeois lifestyle, what would change about their aesthetic and their outlook in a far less or completely anti-capitalist society? How would humans view them?\n> \n> I wanna write about this sooooo bad!\n\nSure vampires can like the finer things in life but look under the surface and you’ll see not everything is what it seems. Lunarpunk vampires helped fuel the resistance to bring about about a lunarpunk world. They helped the humans by ushering them into their old mansions and teaching them what they learned over the centuries about survival and rebuilding. When asked why they’ve decided to help, they always give the same reply. “Some vampires squandered their money soon after their death and gave the appearance of luxury. But you can’t take money with you to the grave. …” \n\nNow that a lunarpunk society has been established, vampires have been accepted as part of human society. They teach in universities at night and hold memorials for collective grieving over the plants and animals people no longer remember once existed. And those who would die too soon are given another option… They are our teachers, our collective memory, and our healers."

That’s because other trees will feed it a solution through it’s root system to keep it alive. There are ‘mother trees’ that give rise to the next generation too.

They looked up, seeking a model in the largest and most reliable source of nocturnal light they knew: the moon. And so, for a brief and literally shining moment early in the days of human-harnessed electricity, the future of municipal lighting was glowing orbs suspended high above cities – towers, resembling oil derricks, capped with 4 to 6 [arc lamps](https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FArc_lamp&t=OWUxZWQ1ODhmMGZmNjQyZmNlOTU4ZTg1MDgxMWExMWExZjI3Njg3YyxLZE5kVEZUYw%3D%3D&b=t%3AnhRkDqkruKWZoA7CFtIcFA&p=https%3A%2F%2Fsolvoid-lunarpunk.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F179214356551%2Ftower-of-light-when-electricity-was-new-people&m=1) with [a candlepower of 2,000 to 6,000 each](https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lowtechmagazine.com%2F2009%2F01%2Fmoonlight-towers-light-pollution-in-the-1800s.html&t=OTc1OTcyN2EyNGEyMmFhZTkwYzA4OTEwMWQ3ODA4OWFkZjI0NjYyNSxLZE5kVEZUYw%3D%3D&b=t%3AnhRkDqkruKWZoA7CFtIcFA&p=https%3A%2F%2Fsolvoid-lunarpunk.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F179214356551%2Ftower-of-light-when-electricity-was-new-people&m=1). These manmade moons made the ultimate promise to the people below them: that they would never again be in the dark.“\n\nAs Lunarpunks, we need to remember that while a lot of things have happened in the past hundred years or so, we still feel this need to light up the darkness. To shine a light on the unknown and possibly dangerous world around us and we’re just learning how destructive this urge can be with the deaths of pufflings, throwing off migratory bird patterns, and disrupting sea turtles reproductive patterns. It’s up to all of to help us to not only promote sustainable energy but to also to protect our night sky from light pollution and with a little work, perhaps the next hundred years will bring back the night sky while also allowing us the safety we so crave as human beings within that darkness.\n\n**Source:**\n\n[https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/03/tower-of-light-when-electricity-was-new-people-used-it-to-mimic-the-moon/273445/](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/03/tower-of-light-when-electricity-was-new-people-used-it-to-mimic-the-moon/273445/)"

There are currently 71 species of mushrooms around the world that are known the glow.\n\n![glowing-mushrooms-from-brazil-foxfire.jpg](https://boyslifeorg.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/glowing-mushrooms-from-brazil-foxfire.jpg)\n\n1.

Hawsbill Turtle.\n\n![tumblr_nve8b9GIFW1rvn61co1_1280.jpg](https://66.media.tumblr.com/47b87a64c75f6d17e5c173c0057cf489/tumblr_nve8b9GIFW1rvn61co1_1280.jpg)\n\n1.

In the United States it's found in the form of the Foxfire mushroom. This mushroom was even said to have been suggested by Benjamin Franklin, to be used as lighting on board one of the first ever submarines due to its eerie glow.\n\n![tumblr_p1q2byhNpu1rozocso1_540.gif](https://66.media.tumblr.com/02a189a1596333c5c83e58891cb37f60/tumblr_p1q2byhNpu1rozocso1_540.gif)\n\nThe main colors for mushrooms that glow are green, however living creatures can have more variety in their bioluminescence and can glow in shades of orange, yellow, purple, blue, and more.\n\nNot all bioluminescence is the same either. Some can be extremely bright and others can only be seen once your eyes adjust to the dark. When it comes to living creatures, their light may be either visable with the naked eye or with the help of a black light.\n\nWe don't know exactly why mushroom species glow but it's thought that either it's an evolved trait to attract carnivores to eat arthropods that may harm them or that the light reaction helps produce anti-oxidants that promote lignin digestion during the decomposition of cellulose fibers. Which is a great theory because all the bioluminescent mushrooms in existence are wood decayers.\n\nWhatever it is that promotes light emittance in plants and in animals, it has a way of inspiring us, whether through fiction, technological innovation, or design.\n\nBut we have to remember, bioluminescence has a purpose in a dark world whether that be attracting a mate, creating anti-oxidants, or warning others of toxicity. What happens if in our obsession with this rare and beautiful gift we destroy the very creatures that inspire us? What if in the future the night is no longer dark but polluted with various light sources and flashes? What happens if we take our love of light in the darkness too far? Wherever we are we need to respect not only what these creature are and what they do but the conditions that made it possible in the first place. We have to respect the darkness too... You cannot have the light without the dark...\n\n**Inspiration** Below you'll find some inspirational videos and gif's from DESIGN:Bioluminescent Forest.

It's more a recognition that we caused this through our capitalistic systems, a movement towards reconciliation with each other, and a movement towards repairing and coming into balance with the planet we've caused so much harm to. This isn't the end of the world, only the end of a materialistic and greedy culture.\n\nWe have the tools today to shift our fate from one of suffering and extinction to one of healing and growth. The solarpunk and lunarpunk movements prove that it’s possible, that people are imagining, planning, and designing a new way forward. We can write a new beginning for our species instead of listening to the narrators of our current story that have already lost hope. It’s time to start putting into action what we know to be possible and build a bright future for ourselves and our planet.\n\n![](https://66.media.tumblr.com/82d7e0a14512e36abfff95f132b0d466/tumblr_o7nainGyxk1t5la2wo1_500.gif)"

Is it the unknown? The lack of outside stimuli that forces us to come to terms with our own thoughts? Our own fears? Is it curiosity? Wonder? Does the darkness even have to be scary? Can't it be interesting? Beautiful even? Darkness is but a canvas, we can project our fears, hopes, dreams, and aspirations onto. It can be a destination. A place. An experience. It allows us to learn more about ourselves. Darkness is a world. It is many worlds. Darkness is multidimensional and as explorers of the deep, it's time to chart our course."

Why it chooses to gently create instead of live up to it’s potential we’ll never know. The more the skies pour down, the more potential energy charge the cities. …\n\nThe more trees grow around the cracks, spilling into wildflowers, that spill into apartment complexes that spill into food forests. The cities used to be powered by rain in another way, but going against nature had dire consequences and the people shunned it. They turned their backs on the cold unforgiving world they had created and found a better way.\n\nTo live gently with nature, to call upon the rain, not to harness it’s potential but to watch what it did by itself for once. Well… Perhaps a single drop of rain wasn’t so gentle after all, they thought when they looked around their beautiful green city and smiled.\n\n</div>"

Which is disheartening since their services are especially needed in those communities. The first issue with time banks is that they assume you are a healthy individual when you sign on and therefore can save your time credits for the future when you may become disabled or in your old age. This isn’t always the case and by assuming so, you leave out part of the community you should be including.\n\nThis can be changed through putting accessibility guidelines into place, such as the following:\n\n- No fractions of an hour. Every bit of work rounds up to the nearest hour. Micro tasks are valued just the same as larger tasks.\n\n- Priority / time frame tags.\n\n- Assignment of a small amount of starter hours when registering for membership.\n\n- Digital services in addition to in person services for time credits.\n\n- Digital community services (newsletters, chatroom, calendar, skype meetings, podcasts, apps etc.)\n\n- Digital scheduling system for the community.\n\n- A possible voluntary one way time credit system. Where volunteers can donate credits back into the time back for redistribution to those who may need them during the month. A simple form could be filled out to apply for extra credits during a month.\n\n**Ex.)** You don’t have any credits but you need a ride to the hospital. If someone donated credits recently back to the time bank and you receive one, you can use it to find someone to drive you.\n\n**However, time banking should never been seen as the end goal for a community. Instead, it should be seen as a transitional tool** against our current capitalistic culture that values financial gain over the people it purports to serve. It allows us to reform and strengthen community bonds while also moving away from the illusion of money as the end goal to one of community as the end goal.\n\n</div>"

When I post a tweet or blog post on an important topic, instead of spending a few moments looking something up, I’ve been getting the ever popular “fight me” response. People telling me to convince them that I’m right.\n\nIf you respond in this way, I’m just going to say it, you look like an ass. And not just that but one that doesn’t even want to know what your forcing people to answer. Your social hacking is backfiring and making you look really bad to other people. Also, I’m going to respond in a way that forces you to think about what you asked, which is only going to make you look worse.\n\nSo, instead of aggressively forcing people to answer. Maybe you should learn to ask the right questions. Here’s some tips.\n\n**Before asking a question:**\n\n- Read the content again.\n\n- What is confusing?\n\n- Look up your question on a search engine for easily answerable questions.\n\n- Think about it. Can you rephrase it and figure out what the blogger meant?\n\n- Is this a question that might have been asked before? See if the blogger has a FAQ's page.\n\n- Ask the blogger for clarification or submit an ask. If it’s really important the blogger will update their post for clarity.\n\n- Feel an assumption coming on? Stop. Back away from your keyboard and repeat all the steps above.\n\n*If you want to comment on a blog post. Do not be combative. You waste everyone’s time when you slam a blogger’s piece without critically thinking about what the blogger meant in the first place.*\n\nWant to learn more, try reading:**[“How To Ask Questions The Smart Way”](https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.catb.org%2Fesr%2Ffaqs%2Fsmart-questions.html&t=ODBlYjhjNmU3YTI5NjE1M2RmMWRjZjM4NzM4YWJiMDgwMmNhZjZiYSxjNjlmNzU1ZmYyMWUwYjkxYzE2YTM3NWY2OGUyMmIzODhlMThiZDVm)** by Eric Steven Raymond.\n\nP.S. It doesn’t matter if the writer/ blogger is right or wrong. Do not call them out on it until you have A. Checked the facts and B. Notified them privately first. At the very least. … Think about what you are doing. Not only are you removing the significance behind what they have written, posted, or shared. You are undermining their credibility.\n\n**On this blog, we don’t undermine anyone’s credibility for personal gain.**\n\n</div>"
