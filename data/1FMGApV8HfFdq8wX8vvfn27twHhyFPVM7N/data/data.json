			"body": "In some days we start into the next year - 2019. I remember on the good old times in the 90th, when many things in the digital world where growing up. The big time of many computer pioneers. The WWW and Linux were born, a start of a great friendship. Tor and other today well known deep webs were not born and the people used the good old Usenet, newsgroups, IRC and mails.\nBut at the end of the 90th a big fear of particularly apocalyptic dimensions (some really thoughts that) was running around the world. \n\n**The big Y2K-Bug**\n\nYounger people perhaps don't know it. In the 70th and 80th the most computer conquered the world. Storage was rare and expensive. And so the numbers for the date had only 2 digits. :-)\nA really little change for the reader from _1990_ to _90_. But for an operating system is was the end of all stories. What about the year _2000_? You asume right. Every OS would start at the beginning to count _00_. But this was implemented in the systems as _1900_.\n\nWhat happened you can see here:\n\n![Y2K Bug in Nantes, France](img/y2k.jpg)\nsource: Von Bug de l'an 2000 - Eigenes Werk, CC BY-SA 3.0, [https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=14719963](https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=14719963)\n\nIt sounds like a funny story, but in fact the people were in fear of problems with banking systems, security systems and computer in the military and industry. And most of the big companies invested enormous amounts of money to solve this bug in 1999. Appreciated $600,000,000 was the amount of damage costs due to this bug in the year 2000.\n\nTwo simple missing digits has feared the whole world in the late 90th. \n\n"

			"date_published": 1545477489.8,
			"body": "I really love working with many different operating systems. Some of them I use for daily work and some others I am just playing with to see, how they work. Perhaps I will try to introduce some of them here from time to time.\n\nOne of my absolutely favorite Linux systems is Puppy Linux. You can get several different flavors of it, I use Bionic Beaver, coming from Ubuntu. One word first: Puppy Linux is no fork of any Linux distro. The devs take the best of several systems together and build a completely new distro - Puppy Linux.\nTake a look at their [website](http://puppylinux.org/main/Overview%20and%20Getting%20Started.htm \"website Puppy Linux\").\n\nI chose Bionic Beaver and worked before with Xenial Pup. Here is a screenshot from Bionic Beaver:\n\n![Puppy Linux - Bionic Beaver](img/puppy.png \"Puppy Linux - Bionic Beaver\")\n\n## How does it work?\nFast. Incredible fast. Puppy Linux is a live-os and you can run it from every CD/DVD/USB-Stick, whatever you like. You can even install it (frugal install) to the harddrive. Further you can set an encrypted partition for your own data. Every saved settings or data is provided there and nobody can visit them. It is a LUKS encryption, as used in many Linux distros.\nAfter booting the whole system is build into the RAM, what makes it absolutely fast, even on old machines. No other system can be faster on your machine. I use it on my old eeePC with 2 GB RAM and it works fantastic. \n\n![Puppy Linux - Bionic Beaver](img/puppy2.png \"Puppy Linux - Bionic Beaver\")\n\nYou can just shut down your system, put off the USB-Stick with Puppy Linux and use it at the next machine. Where ever you like it to use.\n\n## What's in it?\nPuppy Linux comes with many, many software for nearly every purpose. Most of the default apps are lightweight (of course), but very useful. The devs made a very good job here. With the packet manager you can install much more software. But again, it is not Ubuntu. \n`$ apt-get` does not work. But you will not miss a thing.\nBigger packets like LibreOffice can be loaded on the fly with an *.sfs file. It is similar to an app image. You can download it, load it and work with it. If you don't need it anymore, you can unload it to save RAM space.\nBrowsers, Chat, Mail, Text-Editor, Spreadsheet-Editor, PGP, Picture Viewer and Editor, everything is on board.\n\n## Where is the catch?\nThere is no. One may say, you only work with a single user, root. That is right. But consider, everything is running in the RAM. Reboot your machine and everything is fresh and new. It is a good system to even do online-banking. When the system is loaded, you can put off your USB-Stick and just work on. Nothing can happen to your stick.\n\n![Puppy Linux - Bionic Beaver](img/puppy3.png \"Puppy Linux - Bionic Beaver\")\n\nPuppy Linux has a big active and friendly community. Go to the website and join the forums. There is a #puppylinux channel on Freenode IRC.\nI recommended to give it a try and I appreciate you will use it. Really."

			"date_published": 1545420849.8,
			"body": "I really like to use some old computer for my work and my hobby. There are good reasons not to buy a new machine, when an old one is damaged or too slow.\nI am no gamer. My passion is the work with Linux distributions, some exotic other operating systems and, of course, darknets. This doesn't need very powerful machines.\nAll started with my sons. Some day they wanted to buy a new machine with their money and I asked, what's up with the old one. Garbage, was the answer. I could not accepted this and gave them some money for their old machines (which I payed before as well ;-) ).\nNow I had two old computers and thought about their future purpose. Well, one got the home network server for all of us and the other one served a website and a router in I2P.  Unfortunately both needed much electricity to work. That was not really very the best for my money.\nLong story short, I went into the next shop and bought two Raspberry Pi's 2, which took over the tasks as the old computers. One of them works even today as a media server in the living room.\nAt next my workmate asked me, if I liked to get a second-hand Laptop. He was not so lucky with it. I got it very cheap, an Asus E1-731 17'' Laptop. I inserted 8 GB RAM and a new Hybrid SSD/HD with 1 TB. I works like a charm and is my most used machine till today. It is more then 4 years old now.\nI bought myself a new machine as well. 2009 I bought an Asus eeePC 1101HA for about 300 EUR.\n\n![Asus eeePC 1101HA](img/asus-1101ha.jpg \"Asus eeePC 1101HA\")\n\nThis old thing works with an 1.3 GHz Intel Atom processor, 2 GHz RAM and the baddest GPU forever, the \"legendary\" Intel GMA 500. But it works. Originally there was Windows XP installed, but I installed immediately Lubuntu on it. Much better. For some years now I use it with Puppy Linux on an USB-Stick, which boots all into RAM and works very fast (makes the best out of this crappy machine). I'm writing this text with it. I usually work with the Tor browser and Zeronet (ssh with port forwarding) without any problems. Even the Chromium browser for daily tasks works well. At the end I love this Netbook. It works till today and is nearly every day in use. Tough boy!\n\nIf one of these two Laptops will be unusable, because it is really to slow for the net or damaged, I will buy the next second-hand Laptop. In the years I found several ones in the garage of a neighbors or in a  storeroom of a school or in drawer of an old desk of my friend. I didn't took these, because I have two laptops and two Raspberry Pi's (One RP 3 was bought new).\nI do not understand, why people throw good machines away, only to have the newest stuff. It is the same with smartphones. Why do people order every 2 years a new one? The \"old\" one is okay. My Android phone is 5 years old and works. I'm waiting for the first real Linux Phone, perhaps the Purism Librem 5, but that is another story.\n\nI recommended to think twice, if a computer is really garbage to give away. Why do I need a big desktop computer, which needs 100W up to 500W per hour only to write an article in Zeronet? I don't know.\nIf you have an old Laptop, which you don't need, and you are living in the near of me, call me. I take it for the next years. ;-)"

I installed IPFS instead and let it run 24/7 together with Tor and ZeroNet.\nIt works like a charm. I publish 2 websites myself in ZeroNet. I am connected with about 50 other sites, have activated all ZeroMe hubs and I am connected to 54 from 2432 peers.\nIPFS is working as a daemon and publishes one website. It is connected to between 690 and 1300 peers. Incoming and outgoing data is up to 4MB/s in a peak.\nTor works only to support ZeroNet and does not host or serve anything.\n\nThe RP 3 needs with this configuration about 610MB from 936MB RAM. So there is enough space left for some tasks. It works with 30% - 50% of the CPU resources and even here is enough space left to let the whole system properly. \nI am very happy with the little busy friend and it is a good idea to test it. The RP 3 is cheap and needs about 5 EUR per year for electricity.\nI recommended Arch Linux 32bit ArmV7 instead of the common Raspian because of less resource consumption. Arch Linux works very fast and is highly flexible for all purposes. Give it a try. "

Some people says, that BTC is dead and it is true that the BTC lost massively on value after the last big fork to Bitcoin Cash (BCH).\nIn China many BTC miners are closing their doors and stop mining, because the effort to grab BTC is higher than the earnings.

You only need the IP address and enough skills to do such an impact. Okay, that is a too simple description. Much too simple...\n\n![IPFS Status](img/ipfs.png \"IPFS Status\")\n\nA decentralized web is much harder to attack. In form of a ZeroNet or IPFS address you get only a cryptic address, where to find a website. The address only links to a physical address. But this website has no real host. It has as many hosts as peers are serving it. You can perhaps put down a copy of one peer but not all of them (I suppose). A decentralized web has many advantages. But how to build a website with a database with sensible data? Every peer has a full copy of the website. It cannot change the data, but read them. So this could be a little bit complicated, I appreciate.\nI do not know much about IPFS. I just started learning and published a simple static website.

I do not want that Google knows which websites I am using, which music I like and which movies I see. We all are talking about the big problems of the clearnet, but we should not forget that we all need the clearnet much more than the darknets.\nHow do you order your stuff without the clearnet? I do most of my shopping online. I dislike Amazon, but I am a customer. I buy my books there, my computer parts and other things for my home or my friends.\nI order food for my pets online, because I have an ill dog and it needs special food which I do not get in town.\nIf we are blaming about the dirty clearnet, we should not forget, that we need it daily. I transfer money over an online banking account. I send documents to my insurance over an encrypted website online. I order tickets for the next concert - online. I could write and write how many important things are done online every day. Think about your purposes. What do you do online?\n\nIt is right, the clearnet is not independent. I doubt that it ever was. Today it is controlled by commercial companies like the big internet providers, the big shopping companies and at first - from Google. Now, look into my eyes and say that you never use the Google search! I do it. And billions of people do it as well.\nBut I do not use the clearnet without a plan. I only use it for my purposes as described above. Because for all these things I need an account at these companies.\nFor everything else I use the Tor Browser. For just crawling the web to get some information perhaps. I let the companies only know about me, what not is to hide. After that it is time to dive into the darknets. From now on these big brothers will loose my trace. I come back, when needed.\nNow I am here at ZeroNet for fun and to be private and independent. I need both worlds of internet. One for duty, one for pleasure. And I know that in many parts of the world people need the darknets to get independent information (or the only real information). All these people from countries with comprehensive censorship. But even in the so called free world we need the darknets every day more. But the clearnet is not obsolete. Not really. "

That will not function. But you can use in example Zeronet and when you have all done there you can change to I2P and visit some websites. Or you can look at some boards in the Tor network. Obviously I do not use the Xorg with a desktop. I connect over SSH with port forwarding.\n\nFor me as a single user it is a big fun to let the little RP3 work.

It is only about 3 years old and the development is done by one person, nofrog.\nOther darknets are maintained by a group of developers, at least 3 or 4 persons. I would like it, if more people would participate in the development of ZeroNet. On the one hand, the development would go faster on. On the other hand the process of how to go on would be more democratic. If we have only one developer, all depends on his thoughts and willingness. If have nothing against nofrog, absolutely not. He is doing a great work so far. But what happens, when he stops his work? Will everything here then come to an end? \nI think, for a continuous development with the look into the future more than one developer would be a good thing. ZeroNet is worth it.  \n\nMore and more people leave Facebook and Twitter behind. This is a benefit for all darknets because more users are coming here. As I am at Freenet and at I2P as well, I see even there more users coming. Slightly, but coming. Most users will go to the Tor network. It is very easy to enter and to use. But ZeroNet is very easy to install, start and join as well. I2P is more difficult to install and Freenet is much more difficult to handle. So I appreciate that much more users will come to ZeroNet, a well growing community."

The database was also compromised, so the attacker should perhaps have tons of account names and passwords. This impact is a good example, only to use a password and account name once. Many websites in the Tor net are obviously down now and it is unknown, when the service is coming back.\nDaniel Winzen provided Mails- and XMPP accounts too. I do not know, if these are also compromised and offline.\n\nThis shows the big advantage of Zeronet with decentralized zites. Without a server there is nothing to shut down and the zites are 100% online. I do not know, if it is possible to use a database with a website in Zeronet, but I read that there shall be a way. But in worst case, I could only attack this one database from this zite. All other zites are fine. This is a big benefit.  I like Zeronet more and more. ;-)"

Scroll down to the comments: [click](http://127.0.0.1:43110/Talk.ZeroNetwork.bit/?Topic:1543785759_12JYCt1Mj1Fa7GA9N67HAxP6NiBHVWK9GS/Re+Banning+of+ZeroMail+user+who+is+spamming))\nJust open [ZeroID](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1iD5ZQJMNXu43w1qLB8sfdHVKppVMduGz/) and search in the database the name of the spammer. Click `mute` and all is done. You will never read again post from this spammer.\nIn ZeroMe you can click on the name of the spammer and then mute him/her as well. A new entry is written into the blocklist.\nI will post some tricks here, which I found in Zeronet from time to time. It is even for me to better find them when needed."

			"date_published": 1543656990.414,
			"body": "I2P is for many years now my favorite darknet. I use it daily and it is very secure and protects you anonymity. It is simple to install and handle, but you can adjust many things if you are an advanced user (not in this post).\nStart a Tor browser to download the software from [here](https://geti2p.net \"Get I2P net\") (**!Ext. Link!**). You need a Java Runtime Environment like Java JRE or OpenJDK on your machine because I2P is a Java software.\nInstall the software with:\n`java -jar installi2p_version.jar`\nAfter installing you can just click the I2P button in Windows or run `./i2prouter start` in Linux systems from the installation directory to start I2P.\nAt least you have to adjust the incoming and outgoing speed depending on your internet connection in the router config at [configuration page](http://localhost:7657/config.jsp \"Configuration Page\"). \nYou can open a port in your LAN router to get a better connection speed to other peers, but I2P works even without this setting. The port changes in every installation and you can check it in the config: [configuration page](http://localhost:7657/confignet.jsp \"Configuration Page\").\n\nIn short this is all to do and I2P net runs with less resources. I let it run 24/7 on my Raspberry Pi.\nYou should use a dedicated browser for I2P, I recommended the Tor browser, because it has some more security features builtin than Firefox. Just change in the preferences the proxy to 127.0.0.1 and port 4444 (https port: 4445). Permit 127.0.0.1 to use no proxy, because the router page run on 127.0.0.1:7657. So even if a link want to leave I2P you are protected from the Tor network to hide your real IP.\n\nWhen connecting to the I2P network, you will connect to a central server. But in minutes you will connect to other peers, which are changing from time to time, so the entry server is no longer needed. Your I2P client needs up to 30 minutes to get well integrated into the network. Like in other darknets it is good to let the client run as often as possible. Best is 24/7.\nBut even after being integrated into the I2P network, connections will stay slow. All connections are encrypted and every data stream builds an overhead on encrypted data which slows down the speed. Security comes first! I2P is a so called \"Low Latency Network\" like Freenet. \nYou can use E-Mail (Suzy), Forums, Bittorent (Snark) or build and publish a website (eepsite) with your integrated webserver. And, of course, you can visit many other websites, which are called eepsites in I2P. A plugin is I2PBote, a full encrypted and decentralized message system.\nI use I2P daily and after running the I2P router for some time the connection speed of I2P services is higher than in the Tor network. \nFor me I have my personal favorite list of darknets, all used with Tor browser.\n1. I2p \n2. Freenet \n3. Tor \n4. Zeronet\n\nTryout I2P and use it a while. Perhaps it needs a little time, then you will love it."

			"body": "I searched a while in Zeronet and had to notice that Zeronet seems to have some security problems. I just read about them, I am no expert and do not know deep details.\nPresumably some old (outdated) libraries shall be used in Zeronet and this would be indeed a security problem. Every admin or user tries to get the most actual software for his/her system to stay in a most secure way. The use of outdated libraries is a fail and should never be done.\nI like the design of the Zeronet Zites, Blogs, ZeroMe etc. But for me there is only one way. Security first!\nThe second issue for me is the use of an ID in many services. This turns your anonymity into a \"pseudonymity\". You are not using your real name but with a little effort one could follow your ID and could analyze your Zeronet usage. At the end one could build a detailed picture of your person.\nA big issue I dislike is the permanently use of JavaScript. For good reasons in all other well known darknet the use of JavaScript is not recommended. JavaScript is able to execute code in your browser/machine and can transmit sensible information to a server/site-owner. This is really not what you want in an anonymous darknet.\nThis all is only what I read and my own thoughts to that. In summary at time I do not trust Zeronet very much. The other well known darknets like Tor, I2P and Freenet are older but much more secure.\nZeronet has a big potential, but it has to get more secure with involving actual libraries and increasing the security at all. Actual software and no JavaScript would be a good staring point."

I am using the Tor network and I2P for many years now and even Freenet is in use on my server for a long time. But Zeronet is different than all the others, not only because it is the newest one. \nThe <a href=\"https://zeronet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\">documentation</a> (**ext. Link!)** says about Zeronet:\n>ZeroNet uses Bitcoin cryptography and BitTorrent technology to build a decentralized censorship-resistant network.\n\n>Users can publish static or dynamic websites to ZeroNet and visitors can choose to also serve the site themselves. Websites will remain online as long as one peer is still online.\n\n>When a site is updated by its owner, all nodes serving that site (previous visitors) will receive only the incremental updates made to the site content.\n\n>ZeroNet comes with a built-in SQL database. This makes content-heavy site development easy. The DB is then synced to hosting nodes via incremental updates.\n\nOkay, that sounds very secure and convenient, as long as I have the private keys. To increase the security I use Zeronet with Tor to hide my IP-Address, if a link leaves the Zeronet. Tor was already running 24/7 on my server and so I can get two goals with it: Higher security in Zeronet and using the Tor network at the same time. The best browser for both is in my eyes the [Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/download/download) (**ext. Link!**). \nOne of the first things I did here was a backup of my keys. In the folder:\n`Zeronet/data` I saved the files `sites.json` and `users.json` on an USB-Stick, which I put on a save offline place. From time to time I will repeat the backup to stay on actual backups every week.\n\nNow back to the Zeronet. I got my ZeroID and can read and sent mails to stay in contact with other users. Mails are encrypted and there seems to be no need for PGP, but I will check this soon.\nI use [Zoogle Zearch](http://127.0.0.1:43110/13EYKqmPpwzBU4iaQq9Y4vfVMgj8dHeLkc/) for finding Zites, ZeroMe as a little Twitter Clone and ZeroTalk for forum usage. Not to forget the ZeroSites, where I can see other popular Zites.\n\nThat is the information I could gather in my first days of experiencing the Zeronet. I hope, I will learn much more about this part of darknet. This is only the beginning. "

I am here because of getting rid off the big brothers eyes like Google, Facebook and the others (You know what I mean). I like the freedom of speech, anonymity and security while using the internet. The so called \"clear internet\" is completely controlled from the big companies and their goal is to collect as many data from us as possible. These will be sold to the best buyer and the companies make millions of dollar with it.\n\n![Deep Web](img/deepweb.jpg)\n\nI know that I cannot run away from these control, because I obviously use the normal net as well. But if I am not shopping online or reading my mails I can use the darknet to be shielded and protected from the big eyes. \nI like to discuss in some forums and talk to my friend with encrypted mails and messages. For that purpose I use some darknets like Tor, I2P, Freenet and now even 0net. Perhaps in one of the next articles I will describe the comparisons and differences of these networks.\nThis zite is on the good side of the darknet and stays for freedom and anonymity for all of us.
