			"description": "Citation from the book cover: \n\"In our time, the ability to use and manipulate information has become the single most important element of success, no matter how you measure it: financial security, power, or status. Those who work by manipulating ideas and abstractions are the leaders and beneficiaries of our society. In such an era, high intelligence is an increasingly precious raw material for success. But despite decades of fashionable denial, the overriding and insistent truth about intellectual ability is that it is endowed unequally, for reasons that government policies can do little to change.\"\n\nAuthors: \nRichard J. Herrnstein and Charles Murray\n\nTags:\nsocial mobility, education"
