It's bascially just a copy of WalletGenerator.net. They provide a ZIP file download you can run on your own machine offline so I experimented and said \"Let's try it on 0Net\"",

The only thing you need is .html, .js, .json (for ZeroNet config), and .css (for styling)\n\nI really don't know how to do that lol. If you could provide some guidance on it I'd be appreciative",

Maybe 16x16 or 32x32 pixel icons.\n\nThe wallets folder has the images for printing the paper wallets. I'd really hate to lose that feature. Logos no problem, but the paper wallet feature is integral I think. I might make a clone and get rid of the wallets folder and see how it functions and then if it doesn't break it then maybe translate that over to the main zite",
