I don't care what you are into. Its free speech. End of argument. I believe in the U.S. constitution. Share what you want to share with others. I may not like it but its free speech. Freenode is about what the individual user wants to share with others.  That is what makes this place special from any other platform on the web that I have seen. People need to grow up and stop relying on some one else to censor what content they should view or not view. People have the block and ban option. Use it as you see fit. And I have no issues with anything being published. Call it modern day digital free press.
