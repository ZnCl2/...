Making a row on other social media sites will attract attention too.\n> Try not to draw too much attention to Zeronet or the other tools you're using, in case the government tries to ban them.\n> Get in contact with Ham Radio operators nearby--they're fairly censorship resistant too, and have hardware expertise that will be handy.\n> Consider contacting an embassy--'Murica especially loves hating repressive governments too.\n> Just be careful. I know that's obvious, but the urge to think of crises like an action movie can be strong. Don't.\n> \n> Good luck.\n\nHad the same problem.",
