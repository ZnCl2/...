This is what separates a human from a computer. \n\nFor example, many humans believe that other humans should have freewill, which is why your so called democracy exist. The only thing i am sure of is that he is a real president. If you have a problem with how your democracy works, then blame it, not the man who used it against you.\n\nThe mere fact that you believe a subset have human matters more then others, doesn't mean everyone else will. I can also promise you that, those 1.6 billion people agree with less thing you and Trump agree on. It begs the question, why are you so determined to believe otherwise?",
