Majority of indexed torrents/IPFS files will not be available/seeded as time will go and there is no decentralized mechanism to automatically remove long time unseeded files. But StarGate apparently allows any user to remove content of other users.\n\nISSUES:\nQuestion is can i remove the entry if the IPFS is unable to download file for me due to lack of peers? Is it just temporary lack of peers or it will never get peers?\nIf user is allowed to remove any content, site is vulnerable to be emptied if someone is bored and create some removal bot.\n\nIDEAS TO IMPROVE:\nYou can improve the site by using bigger icons that are more easily accessible or showing the hash right in search results for quicker accessibility, maybe even make hash clickable for copying to clipboard easily.\n\nAfter copying there will be countdown timer creating cookie. And if user sees he is unable to download content for lets say 5 minutes, he can vote for dead file. If there are 2 votes from 2 users, file gets deleted?\n\nShow the number of indexed hashes. limit number of results shown.\nWhen i click download icon next to a file, the Firefox 64 developer console shows:\nContent Security Policy: The page’s settings blocked the loading of a resource at http://localhost:8080/ipfs/QmYwAPJzv5CZsnA625s3Xf2nemtYgPpHdWEz79ojWnPbdG (“frame-src”).",
