Is it safe? able to avoid bans? or is it played only in the emulators? is there any brick risk? does it rely on emunand/tethering/etc?\n\nCurrently the Switch Lite is not hackable.  Any switch made before June 2018 is hackable, no matter what. Later ones depends on what firmware they have.  Here's the best guide:  https://nh-server.github.io/switch-guide/user_guide/getting_started/#determining-if-your-switch-is-vulnerable",
