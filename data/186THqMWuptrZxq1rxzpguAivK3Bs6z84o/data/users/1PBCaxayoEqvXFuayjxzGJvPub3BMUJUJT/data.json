				"body": "> [barkbert](#comment_1_1HWJh6kB5X6jzoDhmnBpwXa9KPKEPtmGWf): Cool, but what does this even search? I don't seem to succeed with tags or artist names.\n\n\nIt currently only searches by 'metadataID' Which is just the latter part of the gallery url, so if: `https://exhentai.org/g/1330079/ea3aaac89f/` is your url then `/g/1330079/ea3aaac89f/` would be the 'metadataID' which is what you need to put into the search field (basically complete the url).\n\nYou can put in `/g/1330079/ea3aaac89f/` to test it. Make sure that you have actually loaded all of the database. You will not be able to find the metadata of galleries that are in a part of the database that you don't have.\n\nFor more 'complex' there isn't a graphical solution, yet. But you'd can to make your own SQLite query to find stuff. \nThere are two tables `tags` and `metadata`\nExamples:\nFind metadata(excluding tags) by title: (replace `[YOUR_TITLE_HERE]`, `10` is the number of results you'll get at most):\n`select * from metadata where lower(title) like lower('%[YOUR_TITLE_HERE]%') LIMIT 10`  \n  \nFind 'metdatdaID' by tag: (replace `[NAMESPACE]` and `[TAGNAME]`, `10` is the number of results you'll get at most):\n`select MetadataID from tags where lower(namespace) is '[NAMESPACE]' and lower(name) is '[TAGNAME]' LIMIT 10`  \n  \nFind tags by 'metdatdaID': (replace `[METADATA_ID]`):\n`select namespace||':'||name as tag, power from tags where MetadataID is '[METADATA_ID]'`",
