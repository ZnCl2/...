				"body": "> [cuntwagon](#comment_7_17AcmbLffN1gjfsTf6Jy8K2aBPdMaSBrrf): Would you be interested in automating the process of copying content from sites like Vimeo and YouTube to draw more users in?  I know the amount of data is prohibitive but maybe if users could browse videos from those places and then just click something to download and seed then this place would be more interesting sooner.\n\nI second that: I've been uploading mirrors here at vista.bit and celsius.bit and the frustration is, those mirrors still link to the original sites. It would be great if I could play those videos, seeded, with a non-working ZeroNet proxy and so keep within ZeroNet proper. Synthesizing MDMA may be interesting to some minority somewhere for a very short period of watching/seeding. I'd prefer to see someone 'dance to the beat of water' on celsius.bit, and laugh.",
