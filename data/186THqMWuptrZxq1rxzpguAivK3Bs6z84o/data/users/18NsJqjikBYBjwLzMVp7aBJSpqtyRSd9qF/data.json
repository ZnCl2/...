Using merger sites for different categories of books would separate things up nicely.\n\n3. The extra space taken up by torrent files may drive people away, maybe make them optional files.\n\n4. maybe ask ***[antilibrary](/antilibrary.bit)*** for some tips.\n\nKeep it up!",

Might wanna look into that.\n\nFew other things to keep in mind:\n\n* Find other places to get help--Reddit might be able to help, or know who can. Making a row on other social media sites will attract attention too.\n* Try not to draw too much attention to Zeronet or the other tools you're using, in case the government tries to ban them.\n* Get in contact with Ham Radio operators nearby--they're fairly censorship resistant too, and have hardware expertise that will be handy.\n* Consider contacting an embassy--'Murica especially loves hating repressive governments too.\n* Just be careful. I know that's obvious, but the urge to think of crises like an action movie can be strong. Don't.\n\nGood luck.",

If you can't find someone who know's exactly what's wrong, you could just clone zerotalk and link to it as a discussion forum.",
