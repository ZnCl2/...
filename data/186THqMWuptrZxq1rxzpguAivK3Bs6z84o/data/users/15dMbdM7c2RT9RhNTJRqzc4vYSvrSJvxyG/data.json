Will do canvas bigger as soon as I figure out how to deal with the user file size limit problem.\n\nWhat PoW function are you using? It is a partial hash collision?",

So, to mint a valid bloxel with dif 5 you'll need a hash like 00000a4f9276e...\n\nGreat way to prevent spam! Kinda like Captcha but for computers, I guess. I love your site shows what we can do with Zeronet.\n\nBy the way, how do you handle conflicts? (Like if I edited a pixel offline but another person edited as well, and what happens when I come online?)",

				"body": "> [tiamat](#comment_4_1MaKJotNGHhDQh1BnZCEBqU5Gwj88gFLyR): Every bloxel has an offset relative to the timestamp of the previous one. The difficulty function is based on this offset. The lesser the offset, the higher the difficulty. If there are two bloxels with same sequence number, the one with the lesser offset wins.\n\nNice mechanism! One suggestion: the dark gray color doesn't match the original gray exactly, is that intentional?",
