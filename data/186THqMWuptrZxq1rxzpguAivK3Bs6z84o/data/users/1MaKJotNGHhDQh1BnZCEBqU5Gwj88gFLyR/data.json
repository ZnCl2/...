It is a partial hash collision?\n\nHonestly I don't know :D\nWhat I'm actually doing is calculating the difficulty using a custom function and then the solution hash should have as many '0' as difficulty at the beginning. So, to mint a valid bloxel with dif 5 you'll need a hash like 00000a4f9276e...",

I love your site shows what we can do with Zeronet.\n> By the way, how do you handle conflicts? (Like if I edited a pixel offline but another person edited as well, and what happens when I come online?)\n\nEvery bloxel has an offset relative to the timestamp of the previous one. The difficulty function is based on this offset. The lesser the offset, the higher the difficulty. If there are two bloxels with same sequence number, the one with the lesser offset wins.",

How feasible is it to scale the website (canvas, syncing etc.)?\n\nI'm working on updating the canvas to something faster and more like /r/reddit, I think adding more bloxels to the canvas will be easy if we really need that.\nAbout syncing... I don't really know what kind of problems would appear. Most of the current problems and cheats are 'client' fault (html/js), not a protocol failure. Time will tell",
