			"body": "One of the most common observations I've read all around ZeroNet is that the place feels like a ghost town. To the point that people are losing interest because a de-centralized platform feels de-centralized even in the social aspect if the community isn't bonding over this strength.\nThat being said, here's a general chatroom we can all come together in.\nIt's not any more sophisticated than the tutorial it was made from, but it can serve as a beginners tool to get the conversation started. Hopefully it will also prompt better chatrooms that offer various rooms and etc. But for now, it's a start!\nhttp://127.0.0.1:43110/1XdLr61DgYL2RLFzb6aDMxhbzHSP5sbrx\nHere's to a better community!",
