			"body": "https://www.zerocat.eu - ZeroNet proxy with 900GB storage\n&nbsp;\nHosted on a quality seedbox provider, which charges more than a standard VPS. Uses Coinhive miner running at 10% speed in order to pay the bills, so please click allow and/or disable adblockers on the site if you wish to access the content. If it grows in popularity, then part of the revenue will also be used to donate to ZeroNet creators, as well as other free open source projects.\n&nbsp;\nBenefits of using ZeroNet proxies:\n\n- Get instant peers for your new site\n- View your site from the perspective of other users, debugging\n- Boost availability of your big files until they get enough seeders\n- Use ZeroNet without installing ZeroNet, if storage is limited or ZeroNet client cannot be installed, etc.\n- Raise awareness of ZeroNet to outsiders\n\nHappy proxying!",
