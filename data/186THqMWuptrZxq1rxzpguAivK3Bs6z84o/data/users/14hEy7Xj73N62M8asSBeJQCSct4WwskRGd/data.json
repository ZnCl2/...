				"body": "Folks from Hong Kong, hello!\n\nMy 'name': noldi the 1st - a sovereign human, not a legalese 'Person'.\nThinkering with World(s)-Design.\n\nImagine (besides the ongoing public destructive disturbia), there in Hong Kong is 'Lee' - he rejects the politics of China and stands for a more democratical (sic!) Hong Kong. Also, there was his spouse 'Lucy'. Was? Well, she is going into a divorce action, because she is pro China (sic!). Notice - both are nothing else, than modern slaves, brought in this legalese situation by here leaders, and here own immaturity! But yes, both should have the freedom, to remain deceived!\n\nIs there a sustainable and peacefully remedy for the actual political situation in Hong Kong?  Of course! Simply spoken: 'Lee' and 'Lucy' may fight here war, but whitout You! \nWhat can You do, for a sustainable remedy of the destructive disturbia in Hong Kong? Well:\n1. Start thinking.\n2. Leave the status of a modern slave, by\n3. Becoming a sovereign human.\n\nYou didn't know how to?\n\nYou can asked me, at:\nnoldicom@protonmail.com\nor\nnoldi@zeroid.bit     (via ZeroNet)\n\nThY!",
