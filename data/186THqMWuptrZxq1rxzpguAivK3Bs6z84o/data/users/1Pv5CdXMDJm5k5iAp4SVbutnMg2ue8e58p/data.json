				"body": "Just for Your information: in Estonian language the word \"pepus\" stands for \"in ass\" and it's a derogatory way for saying that the thing that is \"in the ass\" has been RUINED, FAILED. The expression, \"See l채ks pepusse\"(\"That went into an ass\") is a derogatory way of saying \"That is ruined.\" The \"See l채ks pepusse\" has even a stronger, more derogatory, version: \"See l채ks persse\". The meaning of the \"See l채ks persse\" is the same, except that the word \"pepu\" is what little children are taught to use for their \"ass\" and the word \"perse\" is all out derogatory. The \"Peppuz MicroBlog\" hints that it's a blog that has been ruined, a failed blog, a \"broken\" blog.",
