				"body": "> [technoshaman777](#comment_6_1DTUNWykvXLbxZud5a8gJsq7DxmxcGk52E): Hi, I am very curious how this library works under the hood. The book I selected said \"PDF not available, and that the site owner would attempt to put it online.\" There isn't really a human being taken the trouble to push this book to your zite is there? I read somewhere that all these books were being stored on IPFS. Is that correct?\n\nThe backend of this zite has about the same amount of code as the front end. Everything is done by scripts, nothing is manual. \nThere is a seedbox running the IPFS daemon and when a user requests a book file the seedbox will download the file from a source and seed it through IPFS. This is to keep the sources of the files hidden, so any user can donate hard drive space to Antilibrary. No one will connect directly to that user, his identity is hidden, only the seedbox will download the files from the user and seed to the requester.",
