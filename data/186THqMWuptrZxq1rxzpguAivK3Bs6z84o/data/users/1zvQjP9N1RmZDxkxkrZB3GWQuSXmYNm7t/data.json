I am not sure what is happening with your site -- and ZeroNet has changed since I ran those sites -- it may be a new problem I haven't come across:(. \n\nThe other way I tried to fix my sites is drag the (0) top-right and then click 'Update'. Signing the content.json with this method always gave me an error message for the key. Always when it was a 'siteCreate' -d site not a clone.",
