				"body": "1. This site is just an ipfs hash sharing site. You upload file to IPFS and get a hash, then you share this hash with a name to StarGate. Two user can share a same ipfs hash, but with two different names and descriptions.\n2. User can only delete those hashes he/she shared. You can not delete hashes shared by others. Well, it's indeed a bug that you can see the pencil icon on the hash which is not shared by you. There is nothing to do with VOTE.\n3. Maybe in the future, I'll let the user to evaluate the health of a hash and comment on hash. That needs development.\n4. Downloading a hash which is a directory is useless. I don't know if there is api in IPFS gateway server to download a directory as a zip file.",
