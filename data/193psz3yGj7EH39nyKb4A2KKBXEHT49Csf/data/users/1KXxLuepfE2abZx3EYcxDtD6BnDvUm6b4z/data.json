The grant button doesn't do anything on zerome and when I click on the menu button on  zerome  it shows a blank menu.\n\nSpeaking of menu buttons the menu button on the zero me ap also doesn't work.\n\nP.S. I tried orfox and had even less luck. Are there some javascript settings that I need to configure in about:config",
