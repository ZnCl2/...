			"body": "STEPS TO CREATE NEW DISCUSSION BOARD (HUB)\n\n1. go to [ZeroHello](/) __or__ reload (F5) your already opened ZeroHello\n2. into the site list filtering field, type: 13kifcv\n3. move the mouse cursor over the Millchan Hub menu item and on the right, click the three dots. Then click \"Clone\"\n4. copy the newly opened address of your hub to the safe place (possibly good to find your site address in zeronet/data/users.json and backup also related entries like private key)\n5. open site menu (swipe the button in the top right corner to the left) and scroll down and set SITE TITLE, SITE DESCRIPTION (possibly do not use diacritics, special characters)\n6. in the same site menu scroll up and click OPEN SITE DIRECTORY kind of option. You may backup all your site files here and then modify index.html to customize your site text.\n7. then open file data\\users\\content.json and you can add other file types support here and raise \"max_size\" value to give your users more disk space. Default 5000000 (5 million bytes) is 5MB\n8. if you made any modifications to the data/users/content.json, go to your site menu again, scroll down, click data/users/content.json link and \"Sign and publish\" button. (\"Content publish failed.\" should not be a problem as the hub may have no peers yet)\nDo the same signing and publish for the content.json if you modified index.html.\n_ _ _\n\n[ZeroTalk Millchan merger site announcement topic](/1TaLkFrMwvbNsooF4ioKAY9EuxTBTjipT/?Topic:1548974921_18S47ArorYtHtcicjdGi6VZdhgJgwhrud7/Millchan+merger+site)",

The file to edit:\nZeroNet/data/yourhubaddress/data/users/usersaddress/data.json\n(the usersaddress you discover when you click the arrow ▶️ and click to mute user (do not actually confirm muting), it will show you part of the user address).\nBackup that data.json file so you can recover.\n\n2. how to edit:\nedit the file (to remove comment you need to remove appropriate section). Note that after each comment section is comma at the end of the line. Only last section must not contain the comma.\n\n3. sign & publish changes:\nOpen your hub site (http://127.0.0.1:43110/yourhubaddress/), open its (0) menu by swiping the corner button to the left and scroll the menu to the bottom where is Content publishing section, there add path to user's content.json file (data/users/useraddress/content.json)  and click \"Sign and publish\" button.\n_ _ _\nOver all this is incredibly uneasy task when you need to repeat this often. I hope hub owners will be able to edit/delete content via GUI some time in future.",
