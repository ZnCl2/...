That means the hub owner can edit and sign any file on the hub. The hub owner can also add any files in addition to what's user uploaded and merged into Millchan Engine.\n\nOn millchan, you have you don't have permission to sign the contents of other users' (and letting anyone sign anyone's files would destroy everything). I belive all posts are stored in the poster's folder, which means one would need millchan's private key (or be the owner of that folder) to edit or delete posts, and only mcdev has that because that's who owns the zite.",
