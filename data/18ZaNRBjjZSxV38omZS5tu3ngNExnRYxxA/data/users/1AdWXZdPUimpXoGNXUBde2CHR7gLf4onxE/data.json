I have been following a youtuber called Real Russia.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/realrussiablog\nI think his reporting is accurate. \nThe Russian people are awesome. I grew up in the cold war and it was horrible. The national news media here wants to put america into another cold war with Russia. It just wont work. We have the internet now and there lies just expose them for who they are. \n",
