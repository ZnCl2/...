Today, I tried to find the post again, but I hadn't bookmarked the site. The `Kaffeine.bit` search engine only seems to find the title of a website, but it doesn't index their content.\n\nI found the website by using a `grep` command in terminal:\n\n`grep -rnwi /path/to/ZeroNet/data/directory -e \"keywords here\"`\n\nThat gave me the ZeroNet address (in this case, `1Ajp75FXAxdTzRiRTpdBgd4exvbo4gMW12`) which I used to navigate to the site :)"
