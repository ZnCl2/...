 <h2>What's the plan here?</h2>
 <p>It's to (eventually) decentralize and enable access to all media availabe online! My team and I will be compiling a list of IPFS hashes, categorizing them, and making sure they are valid. For now, you should be able to just submit them and browse submissions. As time goes on development will continue!
</p>
<h2>What's coming in the future?</h2>
<p>Primarily I would like to write a search function to browse all submitted hashes by category (Music, Movies, Shows) to make finding hashes easier.
<br></br>
Further down the line I will be working on making the site more focused on viewing/saving content rather than submitting it. Users will be greeted with a nice start page that will be populated by a few categories kind of like Netflix. Eventually, I'd like to add playlist making and personalized content for accounts/zeroIDs. I may also work on adding the ability to publish playlists for other users to use.
</p>
<h2>How are submissions verified?</h2>
<p>
As of right now, submissions will be verified manually and then I will store and categorize them for use in the future site. I'm playing with the idea of building a system to automatically cross-check if a title or track has been submitted and then automatically verify that the content posted is what it says it is.
</p>
<h2>How do I navigate the site currently?</h2>
<p>
Currently, you have to browse the list of submitted titles and tracks on the main site click one and you will be brought to the html player page. To search just use your browser's find feature to find your content by title. As time passes the site will be updated as I continue to develop and plan the end layout.
</p>
<h2>How do I submit content?</h2>
<p>
<h3>IPFS does not support Tor, use a VPN when hosting/uploading content if you would like to hide your IP.</h3>
Have a movie, show, or album you'd like to submit? All you have to do is run "ipfs add /path/to/file.mp4" or "ipfs add -r /path/to/directory/" and your content will be put onto IPFS and ready to share!
<br></br>
If you enjoy content here, please pin it! To pin an IPFS hash just run "ipfs pin add /ipfs/hash". Pinning will download the file locally and have you to host the same content so more users can stream even faster!
<br></br>
Sadly, adding content to IPFS through a VPN can be rather slow. I'd reccomend running the command before going to sleep or work.
