 <title>IPFS MMDB</title>
 <h2>IPFS Multi-Media Database Project</h2>
<h3>IPFS DOES NOT SUPPORT TOR YET BUT, A VPN WILL HIDE YOUR IP FROM THE NETWORK</h3>
 <p>Submit IPFS hashes to music, movies, and shows!</p>
<p>I'm going to start development on a distributed entertainment website using ZeroNet and IPFS to host content. First, we need the content, that's where you come in. Download your favorite movies, music and TV shows and host them on IPFS, when the site is finished other users will be encouraged to pin files and host them as well to maintain persistent storage.

</p>

<h3>Entry Format Example:</h3>
<p>Media Type, Title, Artist/Director, Genre, Album, Year</p>
<p>Music, Dinan, Oskar Schuster, Classical, Sneeuwland, 2014, <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8080/ipfs/QmcYKHpcBJNL9uaxxTZJGuk9QYBfS3cDuYKoELPhfdmRqn">/ipfs/QmcYKHpcBJNL9uaxxTZJGuk9QYBfS3cDuYKoELPhfdmRqn</a></p>
<p>Be sure to check the "More Info" area for more guidelines on submitting</p>
<h3>Notes:</h3>
<p>IPFS seems to best handle .mp4 and .mp3 files. .mkv gets corrupted, .flac and .wmv can't be streamed, only downloaded. You can easily convert files using VLC. I will post a script later to help people with a lot of files to convert</p>
<p>For media type please only use Music, Movie, or Show</p>
<p>For genre please just keep it simple, Classical, Classic Rock, Country, Metal, Comedy, Action, Drama, etc.</p>
<p>If submitting an album, please put "NA" as the title and put the title of the album where it belongs</p>
<p>If submitting a movie, please put "NA" under album</p>
<p>If submitting a show, please put the season number under album</p>
<p>Movie hashes MUST be direct to the movie, and shouldn't contain actual words. If your hash does, run "ipfs reslove /ipfs/hash/whatever"</p>
<p>For now, all hashes are going to auto-convert to direct links. In the future the list will be prettier and the links will take you to a media player that allows playlisting</p>
