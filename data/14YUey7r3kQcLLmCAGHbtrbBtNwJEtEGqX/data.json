The development is in the very early stages, and the project has decentralized crowdfunding here:\nhttps://lighthouse.bitseattle.com//lighthouse-projects/\n\nBitseattle.com is a site that hosts .lighthouse-project files used in decentralized crowdfunding. It has successfully \"decentrally\" crowdfunded its own SSL certificate.\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/LighthouseProjects/comments/2tn37l/introducing_a_new_lighthouse_pledge_server/\n\n \n\n![image alt](img/lighthouse.png)\nhttps://www.vinumeris.com/lighthouse\n\nQuote from the site:\n> Lighthouse is a specialised Bitcoin wallet that knows how to pledge money to projects, using the smart contracts features of the block chain. When enough money has been pledged to reach the project's goal it becomes possible to take the money out of the project backer's Lighthouse wallets. Until that point is reached pledges can be undone at any time without the involvement of the project creator. \n\n \n\n![image alt](img/bitsquare.png)\nhttps://bitsquare.io/\n\nBitsquare is a decentralized bitcoin exchange still in development.\nHere is the crowdfunding: http://bitsquare.io/bitsquare-v0-2.lighthouse-project\n\nHere is a link to the whitepaper: https://bitsquare.io/bitsquare.pdf"
