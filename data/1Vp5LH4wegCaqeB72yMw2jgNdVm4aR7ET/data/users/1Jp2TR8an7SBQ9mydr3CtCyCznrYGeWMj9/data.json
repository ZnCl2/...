			"body": "https://www.infowars.com/posts/watch-macron-slapped-in-face-during-tour-of-france/\n\nmy problems : \n\n- mandatory vaxxing children in relation to agnes buzin clan.\n- plants of the creation illegal.\n- crazy&irrational pLandemic reaction.\n- censorship.\n\nProblem of the bearded man : “Down with Macronie!”\n\nPrime Minister Jean Castex :\n\n“Politics can in no way be about violence, verbal aggression, much less physical aggression…we are all concerned, this concerns the foundations of our democracy,” Castex said, speaking at a session of the National Assembly.\n\nWhy jail, torture, ruin people for plants of the creations? coca, poppy, cannabis? \nWhy polanski could be a star?\n\nLe Pen\n\n“Although democratic debate can be bitter, it can by no means tolerate physical violence. I strongly condemn the unacceptable physical aggression targeting the President of the Republic,” \n\nweed? polanski? demographic invasion and population replacement? mad and confiscatory taxation? \nplaying her hegelian dialectic opposition role better than her dad.\n\nnow ignore, ridicule, what ever... \n\nps your boy is still alive... to the boy : not like at the \"bank\" :), leave : 1 term enough.\n\nconclusion: the problem isn't macron, it's the 5th republic... \n\n",
