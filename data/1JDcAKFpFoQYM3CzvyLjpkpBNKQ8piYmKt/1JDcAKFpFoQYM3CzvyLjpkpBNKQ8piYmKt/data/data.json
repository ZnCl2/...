			"title": "Some scientific tools on Linux",
			"date_published": 1457532808,
			"body": "For memory, and because I like to install a new Linux distribution too often, I wrote a very simple script that download and install some useful softwares. (Tested on my Manjaro, should work also on Arch, and some other distributions with pacman and yaourt if they exist.)\nFirst, a description of the tools it installs :\n\n### For optics\n- [Optical Ray Tracer](http://arachnoid.com/OpticalRayTracer/index.html) is a small application that does ray tracing with mirrors and lenses. Written in Java, GPL license.\n\n### For all sciences\n- [Kile](http://kile.sourceforge.net/) KDE LaTeX editor, that does its job and have some cool features if you never remember how to make tables or add a croped image. I just never managed (and was to lazy to investigate) to make it find some packages even if they are supposed to be installed on my system, but that's not necessarily Kile's fault.\n\n- [GNU Octave](http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) and [Scilab](http://www.scilab.org/en/download/latest), two open sources softwares supposed to do the same work than Matlab. I never used them long enough to know the differences between them, though. Sadly, I have my marks on Matlab and always end up going back to it.\n\n- [ImageJ](http://imagej.net/Welcome) or [Fiji](http://fiji.sc/Fiji) is a small and useful software to easily analyse images, like having their spectrum, measuring angles or distance, setting scale... I have still to learn all its potential. Often used in the last labs I was in. Fiji is just ImageJ, with some other scripts on it.\n\n- [Gnuplot](http://www.gnuplot.info/) is a command-line tool to make graphs. I wanted to learn to use it, but not yet had the occasion to take this time.\n\n- [IPE](http://ipe.otfried.org/) : I love it ! I you don't want to draw your graphics on Powerpoint anymore, and are afraid of Inkscape, IPE is just what you need. It can draw the basic shapes, with several modes of \"attraction\" (to a grid, to the previous lines, to specific angles...), and has sufficient options of line widths, colors, etc, so that you are able to draw what you need. Also, you can write LateX in it, and export in eps (so that you have directly a pretty vectorial image in you paper).\n\n### To free your internet access\n- [Unbound](https://unbound.net/) is a not too complicated to install DNS resolver. If, like me, your gouvernment is asking internet access providers to block some hostnames by DNS, then you just don't care. There is a lot of options, I didn't care to configure it very profoundly, I just wanted it to work.\n\n## The script\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Download Optical Ray Tracer\necho Optical Ray Tracer\nwget http://arachnoid.com/OpticalRayTracer/resources/OpticalRayTracer.jar http://arachnoid.com/OpticalRayTracer/images/OpticalRayTracer_32x32.png\nsudo mv OpticalRayTracer.jar OpticalRayTracer.png /usr/local/bin/\n\n# Write the .desktop launcher\necho [Desktop Entry] > ~/.local/share/applications/OpticalRayTracer.desktop\necho Comment= >> ~/.local/share/applications/OpticalRayTracer.desktop\necho Exec=java -jar /usr/local/bin/OpticalRayTracer.jar >> ~/.local/share/applications/OpticalRayTracer.desktop\necho Icon=/usr/local/bin/OpticalRayTracer.png >> ~/.local/share/applications/OpticalRayTracer.desktop\necho Name=Optical Ray Tracer >> ~/.local/share/applications/OpticalRayTracer.desktop\necho NoDisplay=false >> ~/.local/share/applications/OpticalRayTracer.desktop\necho Path[$e]= >> ~/.local/share/applications/OpticalRayTracer.desktop\necho StartupNotify=true >> ~/.local/share/applications/OpticalRayTracer.desktop\necho Terminal=0 >> ~/.local/share/applications/OpticalRayTracer.desktop\necho TerminalOptions= >> ~/.local/share/applications/OpticalRayTracer.desktop\necho Type=Application >> ~/.local/share/applications/OpticalRayTracer.desktop\necho X-KDE-SubstituteUID=false >> ~/.local/share/applications/OpticalRayTracer.desktop\necho X-KDE-Username= >> ~/.local/share/applications/OpticalRayTracer.desktop\n\n# Install by the usual way the next applications\necho Kile (LaTEX)\nsudo pacman -S kile\necho Octave\nsudo pacman -S octave\necho Scilab\nsudo yaourt -S scilab\necho ImageJ\nsudo yaourt -S imagej\necho Gnuplot\nsudo pacman -S gnuplot\n\n# Download IPE\necho IPE\nsudo yaourt -S ipe\nwget https://a.fsdn.com/allura/p/ipe7/icon\nsudo mv icon /usr/lib/ipe/icon.png\n\n# Write the .desktop launcher\necho [Desktop Entry] > ~/.local/share/applications/IPE.desktop\necho Comment[fr_FR]= >> ~/.local/share/applications/IPE.desktop\necho Comment=  >> ~/.local/share/applications/IPE.desktop\necho Exec=ipe >> ~/.local/share/applications/IPE.desktop\necho GenericName[fr_FR]= >> ~/.local/share/applications/IPE.desktop\necho GenericName= >> ~/.local/share/applications/IPE.desktop\necho Icon=/usr/lib/ipe/icon.png >> ~/.local/share/applications/IPE.desktop\necho MimeType=application/xml; >> ~/.local/share/applications/IPE.desktop\necho Name[fr_FR]=ipe >> ~/.local/share/applications/IPE.desktop\necho Name=ipe >> ~/.local/share/applications/IPE.desktop\necho NoDisplay=false >> ~/.local/share/applications/IPE.desktop\necho Path[$e]= >> ~/.local/share/applications/IPE.desktop\necho StartupNotify=true >> ~/.local/share/applications/IPE.desktop\necho Terminal=0 >> ~/.local/share/applications/IPE.desktop\necho TerminalOptions= >> ~/.local/share/applications/IPE.desktop\necho Type=Application >> ~/.local/share/applications/IPE.desktop\necho X-DBUS-ServiceName= >> ~/.local/share/applications/IPE.desktop\necho X-DBUS-StartupType= >> ~/.local/share/applications/IPE.desktop\necho X-KDE-SubstituteUID=false >> ~/.local/share/applications/IPE.desktop\necho X-KDE-Username= >> ~/.local/share/applications/IPE.desktop\n\n# Install and configure Unbound\necho Unbound\nsudo pacman -S unbound\nsudo chmod -v 0777  unbound.conf\nsudo echo 'server:' > /etc/unbound/unbound.conf\nsudo echo '  use-syslog: yes' >> /etc/unbound/unbound.conf\nsudo echo '  username: \"unbound\"' >> /etc/unbound/unbound.conf\nsudo echo '  directory: \"/etc/unbound\"' >> /etc/unbound/unbound.conf\nsudo echo 'interface: 127.0.0.1' >> /etc/unbound/unbound.conf\nsudo curl -o /etc/unbound/roots.hints https://www.internic.net/domain/named.cache\nsudo echo 'root-hints: \"/etc/unbound/roots.hints\"' >> /etc/unbound/unbound.conf\nsudo echo 'nameserver 127.0.0.1' > /etc/resolv.conf\nsudo unbound-control-setup\necho 'remote-control:' >> /etc/unbound/unbound.conf\necho '    control-enable: yes' >> /etc/unbound/unbound.conf\necho '    control-interface: 127.0.0.1' >> /etc/unbound/unbound.conf\necho '    control-port: 8953' >> /etc/unbound/unbound.conf\necho '    server-key-file: \"/etc/unbound/unbound_server.key\"' >> /etc/unbound/unbound.conf\necho '    server-cert-file: \"/etc/unbound/unbound_server.pem\"' >> /etc/unbound/unbound.conf\necho '    control-key-file: \"/etc/unbound/unbound_control.key\"' >> /etc/unbound/unbound.conf\necho '    control-cert-file: \"/etc/unbound/unbound_control.pem\"' >> /etc/unbound/unbound.conf\nunbound-checkconf >> Reinstall.log\nsudo systemctl enable unbound.service\nsystemctl start unbound.service\n\n\nexit 0\n```\n\nYeah, nothing very complicated, it's just to avoid doing everything by hand.\n\nTo use this script, just copy it in a new file, and then start it :\n``` bash\nsudo ./script\n```\n"

As it is not easy to find : one need to click on the ![computer and blue book](http://paristech.institutoptique.fr/images/IOGS/site.gif) icons to access the lessons.\n- [RP Photonics encyclopedia of laser physics and technology](https://www.rp-photonics.com/encyclopedia.html)\nQuite complete encyclopedia, useful when working in a lab and having questions. Not really providing complete mathematical demonstations.\n\n## Data\n- [Refractive index](http://refractiveindex.info/)\nVery detailled database of a lot of optical glasses, with possibility to export the datas.\n"

For now, it doesn't accept searching in the website itself, but pasting a url from a paper provider works just fine.\n\n- [Library Genesis](http://libgen.io/)\nRussian online library giving access to a lot of scientific books. The classification by topics is quite well done and permits to choose directly a precise field of studies.\n\n- [Directory of Open Access Journals](https://doaj.org/)\n[Directory of Open Access Books](http://www.doabooks.org/doab?uiLanguage=en)\n[Directory of Open Access Repositories](http://www.opendoar.org/)\nNot really tested yet, but maybe the papers/books/data you are looking for are already in open access. It's worth a try."
