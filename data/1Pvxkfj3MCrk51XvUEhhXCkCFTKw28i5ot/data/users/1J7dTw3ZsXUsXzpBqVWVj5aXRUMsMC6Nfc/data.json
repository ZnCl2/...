I'll probably watch S2E02 tonight and if it's as disappointing as S2E01 I'l probably skip the rest. But let's seeâ€¦\n\nk. I am enjoying it :)",

Fortunately, DR (the Danish Broadcasting Corporation) has several more or less official streams that can be watched with VLC (a friend of mine wrote a perl script that extracts the proper URLs from DRs pages that otherwise require Flash and then spawns VLC), so I've been watching my favourites: archery and diving. :)\n\nYour friend is good with Perl.
