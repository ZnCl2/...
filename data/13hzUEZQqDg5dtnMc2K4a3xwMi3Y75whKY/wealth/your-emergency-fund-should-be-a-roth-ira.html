        <p><strong>Citizens of the USA:</strong> If you’re just starting out in life, you have a tough decision to make: start saving for your retirement now and take advantage of compounding over a longer period of time, or contribute to an emergency fund to use as a safety net.</p>

<p>It’s a difficult decision to make.</p>

<p>Luckily, it’s one you don’t have to make. Invest the maximum possible in a Roth IRA each year until you have about 130% of your emergency fund. Just leave the cash in a money market fund or maybe a super boring bond fund (like TLT).</p>

<p>Keep track of all your contributions to the Roth IRA. With a Roth IRA, you can withdraw any amount up to your total contribution level without penalty. So you’d better keep track of how much you contributed in case you ever need to do just that.</p>

<p>If you’re <em>not</em> just starting out in life, this is a handy piece of information to have in your toolbox. You might find that this is a good option for you some day.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you live in the USA and don’t know what an IRA is, then go google this shit now!</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="the-roth-ira">The Roth IRA</h2>

<p>The Roth IRA has only been around since 1997. The big difference between a Roth and a traditional IRA (<em>individual retirement account</em>) is that you get no tax benefits now; but you can withdraw funds from a Roth tax-free when you retire.</p>

<p>That’s the key difference, and that’s what almost everybody focuses on when they talk about Roths.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Traditional IRA:</strong> Investment x growth x tax-rate-later = End Amount</p>

  <p><strong>Roth IRA:</strong> Investment x tax-rate-now x growth = End Amount</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you focus only on that one difference, then investing in a Roth makes sense as a gamble that you’ll be in a higher tax-bracket when you retire. For someone in their peak earning years, that’s probably a bad bet; for someone just starting out, that’s (hopefully) a good bet.</p>

<p>So in general, the Roth is a good choice for young people or whenever you find yourself in a low tax bracket.</p>

<h2 id="withdrawals-are-the-key">Withdrawals are the key</h2>

<p>With a traditional IRA, you can withdraw the money, but you have to pay taxes on it when you do. And if you’re under age 59.5 you get hit with a 10% penalty charge (unless you set up a <em>series of substantially equal payments</em> which is too much for me to go into here).</p>

<p>Taxes + 10% penalty = Only withdraw if you owe money to the mob</p>

<p>But with a Roth, you can withdraw the <em>contributions</em> (but not the <em>earnings</em>) without penalty at any time. The government already taxed you on them, so I guess they’re OK with you taking them out of the Roth IRA.</p>

<p>With a traditional IRA, you’d have to pay taxes, but you got a tax break on them when you invested, so it would be a wash if it weren’t for the 10% penalty. With a Roth; no 10% penalty unless you withdraw more than you put in.</p>

<p>This means you can treat the contributions to your Roth IRA as an emergency fund. If you ever need them (you know, for some emergency), you can pull them out. If not, they keep growing free from taxes on interest, dividends, and capital gains.</p>

<h2 id="my-advice-if-youre-a-youngster">My advice if you’re a youngster</h2>

<p>Figure out how much money you want in your emergency fund. Maybe it’s 4-months-worth of living expenses. Maybe it’s a whole year. Whatever, I’m not here to give advice about that.</p>

<p>If you can, max out your Roth IRA contributions each year until you’ve hit your target. Plan to max out your Roth IRA first and if you have any money left over, put it in i-bonds with the US Treasury.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I-bonds are a pretty good investment. They pay a smallish rate, but on top of that, they promise to keep up with inflation, so you get a separate interest designed to adjust for inflation (as measured by the consumer price index, I believe). That adds up to a lot more than you’ll get from a savings account. Not a <em>lot</em>; just a <em>lot more</em>.</p>

  <p>The bad thing about i-bonds is that you can’t touch them for one year. After that, you can sell them whenever you want. If you never sell them, they mature in 30 years and the government basically sells them for you. Because you don’t pay any taxes on the interest you get from i-bonds until you sell them, i-bonds are sort of like a 30-year IRA with only one investment option.</p>

  <p>So keep that one-year restriction in mind and make sure it’s something you’re OK with. If not, you’ll have to shop around for the best no-loss option you can find.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="target-acquired">Target Acquired</h3>

<p>Once you hit your savings goal, start working on maxing out your 401k or 403b if you have one. There’s an $18,500 contribution limit per year (as of 2018), so unless you’re making a lot of money, you probably won’t have to worry about any other tax-advantaged accounts.</p>

<p>A 401k or 403b works like a giant traditional IRA, so there isn’t much of a reason to invest in either kind of IRA until you can max out that $18,000 per year limit.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One reason to invest in a traditional IRA rather than a 401k or 403b is so that you can have access to your money if your situation changes. If you change your mind, you can’t pull money out of a 401k or 403b, but if you’ve been putting money in a savings account ear-marked for your IRA, you can.</p>

  <p>At the end of the year, if you’re still feeling good about investing that money in your IRA, put it all in at once. If you put it in a traditional IRA (you should open up both kinds), you’ll get the tax break you would have gotten for putting it in a 401k. But you’ll also have lent Uncle Sam those tax dollars interest-free. Again, the house always wins…</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="investing-the-money-to-let-it-grow">Investing the money to let it grow</h2>

<p>Unless you find an risk-free investment that keeps up with inflation, you should consider investing your emergency fund; albeit, very conservatively. The reason for this is that you’ll lose money keeping it in cash. Inflation will make it worth less and less every year.</p>

<p>For that, you’ll probably want an additional 30% of what you planned for originally. This way you have some wiggle-room for the value to fluctuate up and down. So make more contributions until you have that amount and then invest in a conservative mix of index funds and bond funds. Betterment suggests this in their article, <a href="https://www.betterment.com/resources/personal-finance/safety-net-funds-why-traditional-advice-is-wrong/">Safety Net Funds: Why Traditional Advice is Wrong</a>.</p>

<h2 id="what-if-youre-not-a-spring-chicken">What if you’re not a spring chicken?</h2>

<p>You might be able to transfer your emergency funds over to your Roth IRA. There are income limitations for making contributions, but if they affect you then you can probably afford to just stock it all in i-bonds or something. They’ll keep up with inflation and a little more, plus they’re about as risk-free as you can get. But there is a $10,000 per person contribution limit.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You might be able to get around this limit through a tax return. You can convert $5,000 of your tax return into paper i-bonds (which you can convert to electronic ones if you want). This $5,000 has nothing to do with the $10,000 limit. This is also the only way to buy the paper i-bonds; they don’t sell them this way anymore.</p>

  <p>If you don’t think you’ll be getting a refund, you could make an estimated tax payment in late fourth quarter and over-pay what you think you’ll owe.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With the $10,000 per person cap plus another $5,000 from your tax return, that’s $15,000 for a single person, or $25,000 for a married couple that you can invest in i-bonds per year. That might not be enough for your entire emergency fund, but it should make a dent.</p>

<p>Even if it doesn’t make sense to use your Roth as an emergency fund right now, it’s good to know that you have the option. Someday, it might make sense to use it.</p>
