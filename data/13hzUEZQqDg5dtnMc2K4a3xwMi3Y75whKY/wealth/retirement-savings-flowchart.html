        <p><strong>Citizens of the USA:</strong> I put together a flowchart (using <a href="http://dia-installer.de">Dia</a>) showing how you should go about funding your retirement accounts and emergency fund. The chart covers some odd accounts that you probably don’t have access to (such as a 457 account). If you see something you haven’t heard of before, look into it.</p>

</ul>

<h2 id="priorities">Priorities</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Get any employer matches in your 401k or 403b you can first.</li>
  <li>Create a 3, 4, or whatever-month emergency fund; mostly in your Roth IRA</li>
  <li>Max out your HSA</li>
  <li>Max out your 401k or 403b</li>
  <li>Max out your 457</li>
  <li>Max out your traditional IRA</li>
  <li>Max out your Roth IRA</li>
  <li>Invest the rest in I-Bonds or Tax-Free Municipal Bonds</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="rationale">Rationale</h2>

<h3 id="employer-match">Employer Match</h3>

<p>It’s a pay-raise + tax saving… no brainer.</p>

<h3 id="emergency-fund">Emergency Fund</h3>

<p>You should have this for emergencies and putting it in a Roth IRA gives you tax advantages and retirement savings if you never have to use it. See <a href="/wealth/your-emergency-fund-should-be-a-roth-ira.html">Your Emergency Fund Should be a Roth IRA</a> for more details.</p>

<h3 id="hsa">HSA</h3>

<p>Pre-Tax going in, Tax-Free going out (if used for medical expenses), and basically turns into an IRA if you don’t use the funds by age 65 or something. Plus, it’s the only one that lowers your medicare taxes!</p>

<p>What’s not to love?</p>

<p>Oh yeah, to get one you’ll have to have a high-deductible health insurance plan… which will suck if you need the insurance. If you’re young, healthy, and don’t do risky stuff, it’s probably a good risk to take.</p>

<p>Personally, I don’t have one anymore… to risky for me at my stage in life. But I went through many years as a young guy not really using health insurance at all.</p>

<h3 id="401k-or-403b">401k or 403b</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>These are the same thing. It’s just that the 403b is for non-profits. Why do they need a separate but identical account? The same reason the Coverdale used to be called an <em>education IRA</em> (it’s not in any way a retirement account): Because it’s the government. Shut up and accept it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is <em>probably</em> the single account that you’ll be able to sink the biggest amount of money into and it’s all pre-tax (well, except for medicare). And those pre-tax contributions come with your paycheck. That means you’re paying less to the government <strong>now</strong>; not giving them an interest-free loan until tax-time. In effect, you’re getting to keep more of your income (albeit in a restrictive 401k account).</p>

<p>You might not have enough income to max this one out <em>and</em> pay for rent, food, etc. But it’s something to shoot for.</p>

<p>Also, if you’re aiming for early retirement, you should be aware that you <em>can</em> withdraw from these accounts early without penalty (look into “series of substantially equal periodic payments”; just search for that phrase).</p>

<h3 id="457">457</h3>

<p>This is technically a <em>deferred compensation</em> account, but this <em>deferred compensation</em> is held in an investment account for you just like an 401k or 403b. That’s basically what this is; another 403b. And the contribution limits for the 457 are just as big as the 401k/403b!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Really. The 457 is practically a carbon-copy of the 403b, which is a carbon-copy of the 401k.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s only available for government workers. Some lucky people have access to <em>both</em> an 403b <em>and</em> as 457 plan. In 2017, you can contribute $18,000 to both accounts; that’s $36,000 you could potentially contribute to your retirement pre-tax!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In general, I like to get my tax savings now instead of waiting for either a tax-refund, or the chance to (hopefully) pay fewer taxes now by holding funds in a Roth IRA. The Roth is good for your emergency fund, and for when your income limits how much you can contribute to a traditional IRA.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="traditional-ira">Traditional IRA</h3>

<p>Contributions are pre-tax, but you have to wait until you file taxes and get a refund (or pay reduced taxes) to see any benefit. I prefer the traditional IRA to the Roth because the traditional IRA gives you more money to use now. If you invested the tax savings you get from your traditional IRA, you’d most-likely end up with more money in the future than if you invested in the Roth and paid those tax dollars to the government. But it does sort of depend on what the government does in the future RE taxes.</p>

<p>IRA contributions are limited by income; adjusted gross income, that is. So contributing to a 401k, 403b, and/or a 457 <strong>first</strong> (they lower your AGI) will maximize the amount you can contribute to an IRA. Still, as your income grows, you may find a cap on your traditional IRA contributions, leaving you possibly able to invest the remainder in a Roth IRA instead.</p>

<h3 id="roth-ira">Roth IRA</h3>

<p>Use this if you’ve maxed out all your pre-tax options, or if you’re accumulating an emergency fund.</p>

<p>There’s one more situation where the Roth makes sense. If you work only part-time, or have low income, it might be a good idea to use the Roth. This usually happens when you’re young (and probably funding your emergency fund… see how nicely that works?). In this case, you’d be betting that your tax situation now is more favorable than the one you’ll be in when you retire.</p>

<h3 id="i-bonds-and-tax-free-municipal-bonds">I-Bonds and Tax-Free Municipal Bonds</h3>

<p>When you’ve exhausted all of your tax-sheltered options, the best you can do to minimize taxes might be to invest in i-bonds or tax-free municipal bonds. I-Bonds collect interest (plus enough to keep up with inflation – the I in i-bond) in a tax-sheltered way for 30 years. After that, they mature and you owe taxes on all the interest.</p>

<p>I-Bonds can only be purchased by individuals and there are some caps on how many you can buy a year. For that reason, there are no i-bond funds (like there are for other government bonds). Purchase them at treasurydirect.gov.</p>

<p>Many municipal bonds offer interest free of federal tax. If you buy one from your own state, you probably won’t have to pay state tax on them either. It’s best and easiest to buy these through a fund (maybe a closed-end fund).</p>
