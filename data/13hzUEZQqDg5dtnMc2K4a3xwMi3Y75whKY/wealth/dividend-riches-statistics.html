      <article role="main" class="blog-post">
        <p>After grabbing the <a href="http://www.tessellation.com/david_fish/">historical U.S. Champions spreadsheets</a>, I decided to do a little back-testing of the screens I had developed (see <a href="/13hzUEZQqDg5dtnMc2K4a3xwMi3Y75whKY/wealth/automated-screening-for-dividend-riches.html">Automated Screening for Dividend Riches</a>).</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>Statistically speaking, investing in the top three categories is <em>highly likely</em> to be superior to investing in the S&amp;P 500 or the Russell 2000 over the last six years. Taken as a single group, the top three categories (<em>Moonrakers, Topgallants, and Topsails</em>) produced CAGRs that were higher than either index (p &lt; 0.01 for S&amp;P 500; p &lt; 0.01 for Russell 2000).</p>

<p>While there are some big winners in these categories (defined as having a CAGR that beats inflation), there are plenty of losers too. So you have to play often to realize these averages.</p>

<h2 id="method">Method</h2>

<p>The <em>CCC</em> tab only dates back to about August of 2012, so there was limited data to work with, but I think the findings have been interesting.</p>

<p>I went through each report and simulated investing in each winner from all of the screening categories including investing in an <em>S&amp;P 500</em> ETF (SPY), and a <em>Russell 2000</em> ETF (IWM) for comparison. Results were calculated assuming all dividends were re-invested (aka <em>total return</em>).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To keep the results reasonable (and reproducible), the investment date was the first trading of the month <em>following</em> the date the spreadsheet was published. The starting price was assumed to be the <em>high</em> for the day. Ending prices were the <em>close</em> of the most recent trading day.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The S&amp;P 500 tracks the 500 largest U.S. Companies. Usually, when people talk about “the market”, they’re talking about the S&amp;P 500 index. The Russell 2000 tracks 2000 smaller-cap companies (out of the 3000 in the Russell 3000 which tracks pretty much every stock in the US).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>N.B. For this historical data, I <strong>filtered by the EPS-Payout Ratio</strong>, but <strong>not by FCF-Payout Ratio</strong>. This was because the EPS data is readily available in the spreadsheets, while calculating he FCF would require manually sorting through old quarterly reports. Adding the free cash flow filter should (hopefully) improve the results in each category.</p>

<p>Next, I calculated the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cagr.asp">compound annual growth rate</a> (CAGR) for each investment and found the average CAGR for each category.</p>

<h2 id="average-cagr-by-investment-category">Average CAGR by Investment Category</h2>

</table>

<ul>
  <li>Success Rate = Percentage of investments that had an inflation-beating CAGR.</li>
</ul>

<p>Just looking at the average CAGRs alone, we can see that over the last 6 years, the Cruisers appear to be sort of a stiker; maybe it’s best to avoid them. The top 3 categories (<em>Moonrakers, Topgallants, and Topsails</em>) all appear to have beaten the S&amp;P 500 and the Russell 2000, while the <em>Rising Stars</em> appear similar to the Russell 2000.</p>

<p>This, of course, ignores the fact that the dividend yield for all categories is much higher than for the S&amp;P 500 or Russell 2000 indexes. This would put <em>Rising Stars</em> above the Russell 2000 in my book, as they would give you greater income through dividends.</p>

<p>The success rate for the top three categories is over 50%, but not impressively high. That tells us that we need to place a lot of bets for the big winners to move the average up so high above the indexes.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that these data are based on only 6 years, and it’s quite possible that a longer time-frame would be very different.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apparently, no <em>Jolly Rodgers</em> appeared over these last 6 years.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="a-little-statistics">A Little Statistics</h2>

<p>Looking at the averages of two groups doesn’t really tell you if they are different. It’s tempting to just call the group with the highest average the winner and move on, but with only 4 years, one strategy could <em>appear</em> to be better than another just by chance.</p>

<p>I learned of this problem back in my college days. Scientists do statistical analysis on their data in order to figure out if the differences they’re seeing are likely to be real, or likely to just be a matter of chance.</p>

<p>The calculations I’ve created represent essentially several different <em>populations</em> of winners. So I used the scipy library to perform a Welch’s t-test to compare each possible pair of categories.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A Welch’s t-test compares two samples (assumed to have unequal variances) to see how likely it is that they really come from the same population (and therefore the different averages are only due to chance). The number to focus on is the p-value; it tells you the odds that you’re only looking at a chance difference instead of a real one.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In science, we generally say that a p-value of 0.05 or less is <em>statistically significant</em>; that is, there’s only a 0.05 (5%) chance or less that the different averages are really just due to chance.</p>

<p>Five percent is a very high standard to set, and it makes sense in science, where you can collect more data to get a better picture of the problem (and you want to be very careful about what you accept as true). Unfortunately, I have only these four years to go off of.</p>

<p>I think we can use the p-value as a useful guide. If the p-value for a comparison between two strategies is low (&lt; 20%), then I think it’s reasonable to assume that there <em>probably is</em> as difference between the two strategies and we can prefer the one with the higher CAGR. However, if the p-value is high (&gt; 50%), then it’s probably reasonable to assume that there isn’t much of a difference between the two strategies and we should consider them to be the same as far a total returns go. Between 20% and 50% is sort of a gray area.</p>

<h2 id="welchs-t-test-p-values">Welch’s T-Test P-Values</h2>

<table>
<tr align="center"><th>P-Values</th><th>Moonrakers</th><th>Topgallants</th><th>Topsails</th><th>Rising Stars</th><th>Cruisers</th><th>SP 500</th><th>Russell 2000</th></tr>
<tr align="center"><th align="right">Moonrakers</th><td>1.0</td><td>0.11</td><td>0.82</td><td>0.05</td><td>0.01</td><td>0.03</td><td>0.03</td></tr>
<tr align="center"><th align="right">Topgallants</th><td>0.11</td><td>1.0</td><td>0.17</td><td>0.01</td><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td></tr>
<tr align="center"><th align="right">Topsails</th><td>0.82</td><td>0.17</td><td>1.0</td><td>0.06</td><td>0.01</td><td>0.03</td><td>0.04</td></tr>
<tr align="center"><th align="right">Rising Stars</th><td>0.05</td><td>0.01</td><td>0.06</td><td>1.0</td><td>0.11</td><td>0.41</td><td>0.49</td></tr>
<tr align="center"><th align="right">Cruisers</th><td>0.01</td><td>0.0</td><td>0.01</td><td>0.11</td><td>1.0</td><td>0.22</td><td>0.17</td></tr>
<tr align="center"><th align="right">SP 500</th><td>0.03</td><td>0.0</td><td>0.03</td><td>0.41</td><td>0.22</td><td>1.0</td><td>0.8</td></tr>
<tr align="center"><th align="right">Russell 2000</th><td>0.03</td><td>0.0</td><td>0.04</td><td>0.49</td><td>0.17</td><td>0.8</td><td>1.0</td></tr>
</table>

<p>From the table above, we see that the first and third categories seem likely to be equal to each other, but unlikely to be equal to the others. The <em>Rising Stars</em> seem somewhat likely to match the total returns of the Russell 2000 and the S&amp;P 500, while the <em>Cruisers</em> seem to be their own thing.</p>

<p>Without a good indication that the <em>Rising Stars</em> differ significantly from the major indexes, I don’t see much reason to invest in them. And with the indexes having a larger total return than the cruisers, it’s probably not a good idea to invest in them either.</p>

<p>The <em>Topgallants</em> seem very attractive with their mind-blowing 40% CAGR. There were plenty of losers, but a few really big winners shifted the average quite a bit.</p>

<p>Also, statistically speaking, it doesn’t seem that likely that the <em>Moonrakers</em> and <em>Topsails</em> differ that much from one another so it probably doesn’t make much sense to split hairs between them.</p>

<h3 id="moonrakers-and-topsails">Moonrakers and Topsails</h3>

<p>Since these two groups seem to be so similar (statistically speaking), then it make some sense to lump them together as one category and see how that one category stands up.</p>

<p>The average CAGR for these categories taken together is about 24.1%. Comparing the combined <em>Moonrakers</em> and <em>Topsails</em> with the S&amp;P 500, the p-value is only 0.01 (<em>statistically significant!</em>). And Comparing them with the Russell 2000, the p-value is also only 0.01 (<em>also statistically significant!</em>).</p>

<h3 id="the-top-3">The Top 3</h3>

<p>Combining the top three categories together as one gives us an average CAGR of 27.8%. Comparing this larger category to the S&amp;P 500, we get a p-value of less that 0.01 and comparing them with the Russell 200, we also get a p-value less than 0.01.</p>
