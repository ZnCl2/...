      <article role="main" class="blog-post">
        <p>One of the most useful calculations I’ve learned about in finance is something called the present value (PV). This is something everyone should learn, but most people don’t. And to make matters worse, most people who do know this stuff suck at explaining what it is, or how it’s useful.</p>

<p>So, I’ll take a stab at it.</p>

<h2 id="in-a-nutshell">In a nutshell</h2>

<p>Present value let’s you calculate the worth of an investment or a debt in terms of what it’s worth right now. To do this, you figure out what sort of risk-free interest rate you can get and how much money you’d have to invest right now at that rate to either pay off the debt, or equal the return on an investment.</p>

<p>So let’s say you’re considering buying an annual pass to Disneyland. Should you pay the lump sum all at once, or should you go for the monthly option?</p>

<p>Adding up 12 of the monthly installments isn’t the way to go. Instead, compare he present value of the two and you’ll know which one is really the better deal.</p>

<h2 id="an-impossible-comparison">An impossible comparison</h2>

<p>OK, let’s continue our Disneyland annual passport example.</p>

<p>I just hopped over to the Disney website and found the prices for the <em>Disney Signature Plus Passport</em>, the biggest, baddest, most expensive one they have and… holy shit!</p>

<ul>
  <li>Monthly Payments: $79.34 after a $97 down payment</li>
  <li>One-Time Payment: $1,049.00</li>
</ul>

<p>That’s expensive!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: The monthly option seems to be selected by default, so my guess is that’s what they’re pushing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So $1,049.00 vs $97 now and $79.34 every month. How could you possibly decide?</p>

<p>Well, we could get all mushy and consult our <em>feelings</em>. Maybe we <em>like</em> the idea of settling the account all at once. Maybe we <em>like</em> paying a lower price each month. But we’re not going to do that shit. We’re going to let the cold, hard, uncaring numbers tell us which one to choose.</p>

<p>So how do we do that?</p>

<p>At first glance, you might be tempted to do this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>$97 + (12 * $79.34) = $1,049.08</li>
  <li>$1,049.08 is 8 cents more than $1049.00</li>
  <li>Therefore, the one-time payment is a better deal.</li>
</ul>

<p>That’s probably how 99.99% of people would approach this, but it’s wrong. This approach ignores the fact that by not paying all $1,049.08 at once, you can earn interest on the unpaid portion!</p>

<p><em>Present Value</em> (PV) does exactly this. We’ll use it to calculate how much money we would have to invest in an interest-bearing account in order to pay off that initial $97 and then those 12 monthly payments of $79.34. Hint: it’s going to be less than $1,049.08 because along the way, the money earns interest.</p>

<h3 id="the-problem-solved">The problem solved</h3>

<p>This is how <em>Present Value</em> solves the impossible comparison problem. We imagine that both purchases are going to be paid out of a separate interest-bearing account, and we calculate the minimum amount of money we’d have to invest in each one to cover all expenses. The account with the lowest number wins.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’ve never seen anyone describe <em>Present Value</em> this way, but it’s an accurate description, and one that I think will be much easier to grasp than the way most people describe it.</p>

  <p>In case you’re curious, most people go about this from the other direction, asking whether it’s better to get $100 now, or $110 in one year… that sort of thing. They begin with an example where you gain money.</p>

  <p>Listen, when the fuck are you going to have that choice? Never, that’s when. For the most part, if you’re looking at investments that pay <strong>you</strong> money, you really only have to look for the highest interest rate and you’re done. No need for PV calculations.</p>

  <p>OK, well actually, you might use PV calculations for doing something like putting a value on a company’s income if you’re trying to decide what a good price for a companies stock price is, or for something like <em>Discounted Cash Flow</em> (DCF). But if that’s something you do often, you already know about PV.</p>

  <p>These choices between paying X now, or Y installments of Z pop up much more often in life.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="doing-the-calculation">Doing the calculation</h2>

<p>First off, we don’t need to do any calculations for the one-time payment. The value of that is simply the loss of $1,049.00. We’ll use a negative sign to show that it’s money lost; not gained.</p>

<ul>
  <li>One-Time Payment PV = -$1,049.00</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>More complicated calculations can involve both credits and debits over time, so using a positive sign for money earned and a negative sign for money spent is more significant. For this example, it might seem like an unnecessary detail, but it’s a good idea to get used to this now.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And similarly, we can assign the PV of that first $97 dollars that we have to spend immediately in the case of the monthly payment option.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Monthly Payment PV = -$97 + (PV of 12 monthly payments of $79.34)</li>
</ul>

<p>Now let’s view the formula that we’ll need to calculate the value of the monthly option:</p>

<p><img src="/13hzUEZQqDg5dtnMc2K4a3xwMi3Y75whKY/latex/latex-0878190725119cc0abbda91cefc9effd.png" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>C = Money to be paid/received in the future</li>
  <li>n = Number of compounding periods (for interest)</li>
  <li>i = Interest rate</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Notice: <em>n</em> and <em>i</em> make sense, but what’s up with <em>C</em>!? I think this might come from the fact that this is the value after the money has been <em>compounded</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="not-quite-there-yet">Not quite there yet</h3>

<p>Actually, that equation is for a single payment. We’d have to do this for all 12 payments of $79.34 and then add them all together.</p>

<p>To be total dicks, the finance world is going to call this the <em>Net Present Value</em> (NPV), and act like it’s something other than the <em>Present Value</em> (PV).</p>

<p>This is stupid, and just a source of confusion. Both of these are the <em>Present Value</em> of something. It’s just that net present value is harder to calculate because there are multiple payments involved. But we’re stuck with these terms, so get used to it.</p>

<p>Acually, the first payment is easy to calculate. They’re going to take that $79.34 out of the account almost immediately, so that has a present value of -$79.34.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Monthly Payment PV = -$97 + -79.34 + (PV of 11 monthly payments of $79.34)</li>
  <li>Monthly Payment PV = -$176.34 + (PV of 11 monthly payments of $79.34)</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Why don’t they just say the cost is an upfront cost of $176.34 and then 11 monthly payments of $79.34? Probably because this is the offer for people scared of big numbers.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="present-value-of-a-series-of-payments">Present value of a series of payments</h2>

<p>OK, so for each of the remaining 11 periods, we could calculate the net present value of each one. Do this one-by-one and add them all up and we’re done.</p>

<p>For example, in the second month (payment number 3), they’ll charge us $79.34. Let’s assume that we earn 2.39% interest per year (current interest rate of the 10-year T bill). So <em>i</em> is 0.0239 (2.39%) and <em>n</em> is 1/12; one twelfth of a year.</p>

<p><img src="/13hzUEZQqDg5dtnMc2K4a3xwMi3Y75whKY/latex/latex-8227a9aad5d62dd7f6aacdb9172d7f0b.png" /> <!-- _end underline --></p>

<p>You probably don’t want to have to do this 10 more times, do you? Yeah, me neither.</p>

<h2 id="an-easier-way">An easier way</h2>

<p>Thankfully, there’s an equation we can use for calculating the <em>Present Value</em> of a predictable series of cash flows. We’ll use what’s called the <em>Present Value of an Annuity</em> calculation.</p>

<p><img src="/13hzUEZQqDg5dtnMc2K4a3xwMi3Y75whKY/latex/latex-0ccd731b54447c4fef15acfe4b32d372.png" /> <!-- _end --></p>

<ul>
  <li>C = Monthly payment amount</li>
  <li>n = Number of payment periods</li>
  <li>i = periodic interest rate</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you’re not that math-literate, don’t sweat it. You can just ignore that bit in the middle. Just concentrate on everything after that last equals sign.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, since we’re using a time-period of one month, we have to figure out the monthly interest rate that would yield an annual rate of 2.39%. The key to this is realizing that after one year (12 months), our balance will be (1 + 0.0239) times what it was at the beginning.</p>

<p><img src="/13hzUEZQqDg5dtnMc2K4a3xwMi3Y75whKY/latex/latex-5bdf07c2a5032ce3564ecdf93eabba8e.png" /></p>

<p>We can just take the twelfth root of both sides to solve for x.</p>

<p><img src="/13hzUEZQqDg5dtnMc2K4a3xwMi3Y75whKY/latex/latex-30cdd9708703790b1b4e55bb7860736c.png" /></p>

<p>So the monthly interest rate is 0.197% (1.00197 - 1).</p>

<p>Let’s now calculate the <em>Present Value</em> of those 11 monthly payments:</p>

<p><img src="/13hzUEZQqDg5dtnMc2K4a3xwMi3Y75whKY/latex/latex-b1d036d46e961ef68eec3a46da93278c.png" /></p>

<p>And now to add this PV to the others:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Monthly Payment PV = -$176.34 + (PV of 11 monthly payments of $79.34)</li>
  <li>Monthly Payment PV = -$176.34 + -$862.51</li>
  <li>Monthly Payment PV = -$1,038.85</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-results-are-in">The results are in</h2>

<p>So there you have it. If we can find an account that earns us 2.39% a year (compounded monthly), then the monthly option is the equivalent of a cost of $1,038.85, while the lump-sum costs $1,049.00. Not much of a deal, but it’s still the better choice.</p>

<p>Of course, we used 10-year T bills (a common choice for these calculations) for our interest rates. You can’t withdraw money from those every month; you have to leave it invested for the full 10 years. If you re-did the calculation with the interest your bank pays you, it’ll probably come out to be much less of a discount; possibly not even the 8 cents needed to break even.</p>

<p>Right now, Discover bank offers a savings account with a 0.95% annual percentage yield. That works out to a 0.078824% monthly interest rate. Using that figure, we get a total PV of -$1,044.97 for the monthly payment option. Not as exciting, but still a better value.</p>

<h2 id="other-examples">Other examples</h2>

<p>I used <em>Present Value</em> to compare the cost of putting solar panels on my house vs sticking with the regular electric company.</p>

<p>I estimated the present value of service over the next 20 years using the predicable rates from the solar company, and estimating a 7% increase year-to-year for electric rates. The differences over the course of 20 years were very large (but maybe 7% was too aggressive).</p>

<p>It also let me compare the present value of buying the system outright, vs the two other options (basically renting the system).</p>

<p>Buying the system outright would have been a big initial cost, but over the next 20 years, it represented a significant savings. There’s really no other way I could have done the comparison.</p>

<p>I’m glad I learned about these calculations when I was studying investing. Too bad I didn’t learn about them sooner in life.</p>
