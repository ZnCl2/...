      <article role="main" class="blog-post">
        <p>George Blackburn has impressive credentials. He’s one of the guys who figured out how to keep people alive with only an IV drip. You know, coma patients who can’t eat and people having stomach surgery and what not.</p>

<p>So he’s definitely an authority on nutrition.</p>

<p>Here’s what he had to say about weight loss:</p>

<h2 id="in-a-nutshell">In a nutshell</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Set-Point theory is where it’s at.</li>
  <li>Aim to lose 10% of your bodyweight first.</li>
  <li>After losing 10% of your bodyweight, maintain that weight for 6 months.</li>
  <li>After that, you can lose another 10% if you want.</li>
  <li>Add on all the other sensible stuff you probably already know from other diet books.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-10-target">The 10% Target</h2>

<p>OK, so this is probably the biggest, most novel thing in the whole book.</p>

<p>George argues that if you loose too much weight too quickly, it’s like stretching a rubber band; it’s going to snap back hard.</p>

<p>To get around this fact, we lose only 10% of our weight and then maintain that for 6 months. That gives us enough time for our set-point to adjust, without having too much tension on the old rubber band.</p>

<h3 id="the-evidence-for-the-10-target">The evidence for the 10% target?</h3>

<p>To be honest, I don’t remember seeing Blackburn lay out any studies, or evidence for this 10% figure. Maybe they don’t exist.</p>

<p>He definitely does give us evidence that you get the most benefit health-wise from that first 10%; each subsequent 10% loss delivering diminishing returns. But I don’t remember him mentioning evidence for a 10% loss followed by 6 months of maintenance.</p>

<h2 id="lots-of-skimming">Lot’s of skimming</h2>

<p>Part of the reason I don’t remember might be that I skimmed most of this book.</p>

<p>It’s not that most of it is bad or anything, it’s just that aside from the 10% loss and 6-month maintenance period, this is very typical diet book without much new information.</p>

<p>Really, the whole thing could have been a pamphlet. But that probably wouldn’t have looked good on the book shelves… gotta pad those books!</p>

<p>And there are those insufferable vignettes too; little illustrative stories about supposedly real people who blah, blah, blah. You get the picture. Stories that illustrate points so simple that they don’t need illustration.</p>

<p>These real-life stories are the scourge of the self-help genre. I’m convince that publishers insist on them (mostly as an easy way to pad the size of the book).</p>

<p>So if you’ve ever read a reasonable book on dieting and nutrition, you can skip the book entirely and just go off of the one key technique: Lose 10% followed by a 6-month maintenance period. Repeat until satisfied.</p>

<h2 id="my-two-cents">My two cents</h2>

<p>A study of athletic Finnish women found that <a href="http://www.ergo-log.com/catabolicweightloss.html">more than half a kg of weight loss per week lowers testosterone</a>, so I would add that it’s probably best to lose that 10% at a rate no more that 1 pound a week. In fact, to be on the safe side, I try for half a pound of weight-loss per week.</p>

<p>But really, if you’re bigger than these women, you can lose more; if smaller, less.</p>

<p>The average weight of the women in the study seems to have been about 65 kg (about 145 lbs), so I’d say a conservative weight-loss rate to shoot for is 0.5 lbs a week per 145 lbs of body weight (0.25 kg / week per 65 kg bodyweight).</p>

<p>This rate of weight-loss <em>should</em> have a pretty minimal impact on hormones.</p>

<h3 id="but-wait-whats-this">But wait, what’s this?</h3>

<p>Looking at the graph of testosterone change vs fat % change, it looks like a half-pound-a-week loss of fat would actually have been associated with an <em>increase</em> in testosterone.</p>

<p>If we assume that these women had 20% body fat, then they’d have 29 pounds of fat mass. After 4 weeks of 0.5 lbs loss per week, we’d have lost 2 lbs, or about 7% of our fat mass. And -7% translates into about a 24% increase in testosterone according to the regression analysis done by the researchers.</p>

<p>The tipping point seems to be a losing 11% of your body fat in 4 weeks; or about 3% of it a week. At that rate, there’s no change in testosterone level. Anything lower than that rate, and testosterone seems to increase.</p>

<p>So really, I guess we could set our weight-loss rate based on fat mass; not body-weight.</p>

<p>Estimate your bodyfat mass and aim to lose 1.5% of that each week. For the average woman in this study (and remember I pulled 20% out of my ass), that would be a loss of 5.87 lbs of fat over 4 weeks. This works out to a 28.8% increase in testosterone!</p>

<p>Pretty cool, huh?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s possible that with a slower weight-loss rate, you wouldn’t need the six months of maintenance in order to give your set-point time to recalibrate. Most people lose weight about as fast as they can, so this six-month period might be a way of compensating for that…</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="verdict">Verdict</h2>

<p>Losing weight more slowly (my idea) and maintaining a less-than-exciting weight loss for 6 whole months (George’s idea) aren’t attractive propositions for someone who wants to lose weight.</p>

<p>If you’re like me, you have a long history of wanting to lose weight as fast as possible. It was the experience of repeatedly gaining the weight back that made this sort of thing even thinkable for me.</p>

<p>If you’ve never read a diet book, this is a good one. Read it from cover to cover.</p>

<p>But if you <em>have</em> read a diet book or two, then you can probably skip this book and go with the summary of the key points above.</p>
