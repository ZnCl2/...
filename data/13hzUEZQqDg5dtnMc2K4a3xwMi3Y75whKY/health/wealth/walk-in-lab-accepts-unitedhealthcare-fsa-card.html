        <p>You can use the UnitedHealthcare FSA card to pay for blood tests ordered through Walk-In-Lab. This may be in important tool for using an FSA without losing money at the end of the year.</p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>In a <a href="/13hzUEZQqDg5dtnMc2K4a3xwMi3Y75whKY/wealth/retirement-savings-flowchart.html">previous post on retirement savings</a> I included the HSA (Health Savings Account) that US citizens can use to both save (pre-tax) for retirement and pay medical bills with pre-tax money. The HSA has a major down-side that keeps a lot of people from using it; you have to have high-deductible health care insurance.</p>

<p>When I ran the numbers on the plans available to me, the tax savings didn’t make up for the vast increase in deductible, so I decided it wasn’t a good risk. On the HSA side, you have a very good savings opportunity, but on the other hand, a little bad luck can wipe out your account. This is probably a good option for the young, healthy, and reasonably risk-averse, but I decided it wasn’t a good risk for me at this point in my life.</p>

<h2 id="the-fsa">The FSA</h2>

<p>In the post, I didn’t mention the HSA’s smaller, less attractive, sibling: the FSA.</p>

<p>An FSA (Flexible Spending Account) is like an HSA; you put money in pre-tax and get to use if for <em>qualified</em> medical costs. You don’t, however, need a high-deductible insurance plan. And as with the HSA, the FSA has a major down-side of it’s own: you have to spend all the money you put in by the end of the year, or you lose it. Now you see why it can’t be used for retirement savings.</p>

<p>The FSA is great when you have some predictable <em>qualified</em> medical costs that are high enough to justify the minimum investment required by whatever FSA plan your employer offers (for me, the minimum is $20 a month). This happens when you have an on-going prescription for something (like a statin, maybe) that you’ll be paying for every month or so in addition to doctor visits.</p>

<h3 id="the-fsa-blues">The FSA blues</h3>

<p>As you can imagine, many people over-estimate how much money they’ll spend on this sort of thing and wind up with a problem at the end of the year: spend the remaining money on <em>something</em> or lose it all.</p>

<p>In the early days of the FSA, you could spend the money on over-the-counter supplies such as vitamins and band-aids, so people would stock up on them at the end of the year.</p>

<p>Then the US government decided they wanted more taxes, so they changed the rules. The list of things you can use your FSA money on is much shorter now. Basically, you have to be paying a doctor for a service, or whatever you’re buying has to require a prescription.</p>

<h2 id="unitedhealthcare-fsa">UnitedHealthcare FSA</h2>

<p>My FSA is through UnitedHealthcare, and they sent me a couple of debit Mastercards to use. According to to the instructions that came with them, they will only be approved at certain merchants such as doctors offices, hospitals, and pharmacies; try to use them somewhere else and the sale will be declined.</p>

<p>This was the first year that I’ve enrolled in an FSA and I was surprised to find that the account balance was the full $240. I was expecting it to go up by $20 a month, but instead they seem to loan you the full amount and then you pay it back to them in monthly installments. They give you an interest-free loan; nice.</p>

<h2 id="walk-in-lab">Walk-In-Lab</h2>

<p>I’ve used Walk-In-Lab a few times to order blood tests. You order the tests from them at a reasonable price and take the order sheet they give you to one of the big testing companies such as LabCorp or QuestDiagnostic. They draw the blood, do the test, and then send the lab report to Walk-In-Lab, which then sends it to you.</p>

<p>To do this, Walk-In-Lab has to employ licensed doctors so that they can put that doctor’s name on the lab order. There’s no doctor’s visit or anything, so you’re sort of cutting out the middle man here. If you went to your primary care physician, you’d have to pay him for the visit and then pay for the lab work (then possibly pay for another visit). Of course, assuming that you have insurance, it will pay for some of this.</p>

<p>With my insurance, I pay $25 every time I see my doctor and then the lab tests are covered. At Walk-In-Lab, I can get a cholesterol test for $28. For me, that extra $3 is well worth the convenience, flexibility, and privacy.</p>

<p>With Walk-In-Lab, I can also order whatever blood test I want without having to convince my doctor to order it.</p>

<h2 id="fsa--walk-in-lab">FSA + Walk-In-Lab?</h2>

<p>In planning how I would make sure that all the money gets spent, I wondered: can I use my FSA card?</p>

<p>Walk-In-Lab does employ legit doctors and you are ordering lab work; both definitely <em>qualified</em> expense categories. But did UnitedHealthcare add them to the list of accepted merchants, or would the card be declined?</p>

<p>I ordered a simple cholesterol test for $28 and tried paying with my FSA card… Success! Now I have another option for spending that tax-free FSA money.</p>
