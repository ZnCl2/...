        <p>Here’s what my weight training routine is right now. It’s a simple system that uses some very basic feedback rules to keep me progressing and prevent me from over-training. And it does it with the simplest feedback possible: a binary yes/no answer to a simple question.</p>

<h2 id="in-a-nutshell">In a nutshell</h2>

<p>For each routine of your program, base all your weights off of your estimated 1-rep max. Make them all percentages of that 1RM number.</p>

<p>If you get through all of the reps of all of the sets of the entire workout, increase the 1RM by 1%. Then re-calculate all the weights for next time.</p>

<p>If you <em>don’t</em> get through every single rep of every single set with perfect form, work with a new 1-rep max number that’s about 80% of the real one, and base your weights off of that. As you successfully complete workouts with these new lower weights, increase the weights by about 28% each time so that you catch back up to your real 1-rep max after about 8 workouts. Then go back to increasing your 1-rep max by 1% after each successful workout.</p>

<p>OK, that last paragraph might be sort of dense, but it’s hard to make it both simple and concise.</p>

<h2 id="your-1-rep-max">Your 1-Rep Max</h2>

<p>To start off with, you want to get some sort of estimate for your 1-rep max weight for all the exercises you’ll be doing.</p>

<p>The best way to do this isn’t by finding the heaviest weight you can lift once.</p>

<p>Instead, use the Brzycki formula:</p>

<p><img src="/13hzUEZQqDg5dtnMc2K4a3xwMi3Y75whKY/latex/latex-d0b57ecfdb67accf263135124819dde6.png" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>w = weight used</li>
  <li>n = number of repetitions you can do</li>
</ul>

<p>Just grab a weight you think you can lift for about 5 reps or so and see how many you can do with perfect form (we’re not going to failure here). Then use the equation above to estimate your 1-rep max.</p>

<p>The reason we want to estimate our 1-rep max is that we can then use the Brzycki formula to estimate the max weight we can use for any other number of reps.</p>

<p><img src="/13hzUEZQqDg5dtnMc2K4a3xwMi3Y75whKY/latex/latex-d91693ec4794549f1411c8a816579b63.png" /></p>

<p>And this gives us a lot of flexibility. We can design routines using a lot of different rep ranges, but we only really have to keep track of this one number: the 1-rep max.</p>

<p>Each time we finish a routine, we can increment the estimated 1-rep max by a small amount, and those changes will be reflected in the weights we calculate. If we go too far, we can back off by lowering our 1-rep max estimate. Neat, huh?</p>

<h2 id="a-very-simple-routine">A very simple routine</h2>

<p>Let’s make things easy on ourselves by using a very simple routine as an example. To make it simple, we’ll use just one exercise a day. And to make sure that we both know what we’re talking about, let’s agree to some terminology:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Rep = lifting and lowering a weight one time</li>
  <li>Set = a group of reps done back-to-back</li>
  <li>Routine = a group of sets done in the same day</li>
  <li>Program = a sequence of routines</li>
</ul>

<p>Reps and sets are pretty unambiguous, but when we talk about what we do on any given day, or the whole thing all together, there really isn’t any set term to distinguish the two. So when I say <em>routine</em>, I mean what we do on a certain day. A <em>Program</em> then, is the whole thing together; all the routines.</p>

<p>We’re going to make a very simple routine of only one exercise. Let’s use the bench press. And let’s imagine that all the routines in the program consist of only one exercise. So we’re doing one exercise a day, and cycling through different exercises.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is actually what I’m doing right now; one exercise a day. There are some advantages. You can hit the target muscles really hard, and you don’t have to worry about the order you do the exercises affecting the weight you can use. Also, if you have trouble with motivation, then knowing you only have one exercise to do makes it easier to get yourself into the gym.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="warm-up-sets-and-working-sets">Warm-up sets and working sets</h2>

<p>You really should warm up with a couple sets of light weight first. That prevents injury. I didn’t do this when I was young, but as you get older, it becomes more and more important.</p>

<p>I find that higher rep sets do a better job of warming me up, so my first two sets will be a set of 12 reps followed by a set of 10 reps.</p>

<p>From the Brzycki Fromula, you can calculate that your 12-rep max will be about 69.42% of your 1-rep max, but since this is our first warm-up set, we’ll use only about a third of that, or 23.14%. But let’s not kid ourselves about the accuracy of the Brzycki Formula; we can just round it off to 25%.</p>

<ol>
  <li>12 reps at 25% of 1RM</li>
</ol>

<p>Now we can calculate that our 10-rep max should be 74.98% of our 1-rep max, but we’re still warming up, so let’s take 2 thirds of that amount, or 49.9867%. But again, we’ll round that to 50%.</p>

<ol>
  <li>12 reps at 25% of 1RM</li>
  <li>10 reps at 50% of 1RM</li>
</ol>

<p>Cool. The warm-up is done. Now we move on to working sets; sets where we use our maximum weight (or close to it). These are the ones that are going to increase strength and muscle mass.</p>

<p>They say that rep ranges around 8-12 increase muscle size, but lower rep ranges increase strength more. I don’t know how accurate that is. I’ve seen that a lot and it seems like it could be bro science, but one thing I can tell you is that while I personally prefer the lower ranges (4-6 reps), I find jumping from the 10-rep warm-up to a low rep set to be a little jarring; it’s a big increase in weight.</p>

<p>What I’m going to propose is that we work our way down using 3 working sets: 8, 6, and 4 reps. When we calculate the maximum weight for these rep ranges, we’ll see that they work out to about 81%, 86%, and 92% of our 1-rep max. So let’s add these three working sets to our routine.</p>

<ol>
  <li>12 reps at 25% 1RM</li>
  <li>10 reps at 50% 1RM</li>
  <li>8 reps at 81% 1RM</li>
  <li>6 reps at 86% 1RM</li>
  <li>4 reps at 92% 1RM</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: Our 1-rep max isn’t really an estimate of our maximum weight possible; it’s an estimate of the maximum weight we can lift with perfect form. We aren’t going to failure here. We’re keeping the weights such that we never max out. There’s a long discussion to be had about the merits of training to failure vs, not training to failure, but I’ve been convinced that training to failure is not necessary, saps your motivation, and increases recovery time beyond what your muscles require (by over-taxing the nervous system).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are a couple nice things about lowering your rep ranges like this. First, if you’re like me, you tend to run out of endurance faster than you run out of strength, so this strategy works along with that tendency nicely. The other nice thing has to do with the actual weights you’ll be using.</p>

<p>In reality, you won’t be using the weights you calculate for yourself. That’s because the smallest weight you can add to the bar is probably going to be 2.5 pounds (or 1 kilo). So you’re going to have to round all of your calculated weights to something you can actually stack on the bar.</p>

<p>I strongly recommend <strong>rounding down</strong>. Fight the tendency to push your self too fast and burn out like the hare. Instead, try to go at a slow and <em>sustainable</em> pace like the tortoise. Your strength will still grow even if you aren’t increasing between each and every session. The idea that you aren’t gaining strength unless you constantly increase your weights is just bro-science bullshit.</p>

<p>As we increase our estimated 1-rep max after every successful workout, many of the weights will not be affected at all due to rounding. But the more rep ranges we use, the greater the chance that at least one of them will change. So using a bunch of rep ranges gives us a way to sort-of increase the weights by small amounts even without tiny fractional plates.</p>

<h2 id="finish-off-with-a-long-set">Finish off with a long set</h2>

<p>To finish off our routine, we’ll use a long set. That’s because finishing with a long set leads to faster progression, and more growth hormone production. That’s something I learned from <a href="http://www.ergo-log.com/longset.html">ergo-log</a>.</p>

<p>The study they quoted used 5 sets at 90% followed by 1 set at 50% of 1RM for as many reps as the subjects could handle.</p>

<p>I think it’s worth it to throw in a long set at the end of training to boost growth hormone, but not if it becomes a chore. I’m already against training to failure because it leads to burnout. And any program that you can stick with is better than one you can’t. Instead of working towards failure, let’s work towards success; we’ll choose a rep range and weight that we can reasonably expect to complete.</p>

<p>At the end of the workout, you’re going to be tired. 60% of your 1RM (a range known to increase growth hormone) would normally be something you could handle for 15 or 16 reps. But because we’ll be tired at the end of our routine and this long set can easily turn into a torture set, we’ll use only three quarters of that weight, or 45% of our 1RM for 15 reps.</p>

<ol>
  <li>12 reps at 25% 1RM</li>
  <li>10 reps at 50% 1RM</li>
  <li>8 reps at 81% 1RM</li>
  <li>6 reps at 86% 1RM</li>
  <li>4 reps at 92% 1RM</li>
  <li>15 reps at 45% 1RM</li>
</ol>

<p>And there we have it. That’s the template for our routine for any exercise. All we have to do is plug in our estimated 1RM and round down the weights to something we can actually stack on the bar at the gym.</p>

<h3 id="update-2017-05-30">Update 2017-05-30</h3>

<p>I hacked up a script to put together some audio clips into a sort of personal trainer audio program. It walks me through the whole routine, tells me what weight to use, and gives me a consistent rep tempo of a 1-second lift, and a 6-second lowering.</p>

<p>This as a pretty heavy focus on the negative movement and it ends up fatiguing me quite a bit. Because of that, I was finding that last long set to be de-motivating and I cut it.</p>

<p>With a 6-second negative, all of these sets are quite a bit longer for me than they were before, so I doubt a longer final set was really needed anyway. Either way, getting yourself to the gym day after day is far more important than adding every last detail that could possibly make your workouts more effective. And any routine you can stick to is far far better than one that you burn out on.</p>

<h2 id="gathering-feedback">Gathering feedback</h2>

<p>OK. At this point, you may or may not be on-board with the routine I’ve outlined above. You might have your own ideas, and that’s cool. My main reason for writing this is to show you how you can easily use a little feedback to adjust your 1RM, and therefore your weights.</p>

<p>So after calculating all the weights, you’ll go to the gym and start performing the routine.</p>

<p>When doing reps, lower the weight for a count of 3, and raise it in about 1 second, or as close to that as you can. This rhythm has been shown to lead to more muscle growth, but many people can’t do it because it’s harder and therefore the weights you use will be lower.</p>

<p>In between sets, rest for exactly 2 minutes. Studies have shown that 2 minutes leads to better progress than 1 minute, but the more important reason for this is that we don’t want rest time to become a variable. We’re going to get only one piece of feedback and we’re going to adjust only one variable in response to it, so we need to control as much as we can.</p>

<p>In short, since we’re only going to manipulate the amount of weight we’re using, we have to be pretty sure that the reason you can’t lift the weight today is because the weight is too much; not because you rested for less time than you usually do between sets.</p>

<p>OK, so we’re going through the routine, lifting for a count of 1, lowering for a count of 3, and resting for exactly 2 minutes between sets, and using good form.</p>

<p>The rules are simple. As long as you can continue with good form, and completing each rep of each set, keep going until you reach the end of the routine. But <strong>if at any point, you find you can’t complete all the reps in a set, stop</strong>; end the routine and go home. You’re done for the day.</p>

<p>After each routine, you ask yourself a simple yes-or-no question:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Did I complete the entire routine with good form?</strong></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="applying-the-feedback">Applying the feedback</h2>

<p>Alright, now we’ve finally reached the heart of the matter. What to do with the feedback.</p>

<p>If you answered ‘Yes’ to your question, then you’re going to add 1% to your 1-rep max for that exercise (unless you’re playing ‘catch-up’, which I’ll talk about later).</p>

<p>If you answered ‘No’, then you need to back off on the weight. Chances are, you’ve been working near to top of your ability for a while now, and you might be starting to dread this particular exercise. You’re on the road to burn-out if you stay here. Taking one step back isn’t enough; we’ll cut the weights by 20%.</p>

<p>After you find that you’ve failed to complete a routine, don’t change that 1-rep max. Leave it alone as a record of how far you made it before you maxed-out.</p>

<p>What we <em>will</em> do, is adjust the 1RM with a modifier and then calculate our weights for the next workout based on this modified 1RM. The modifier we’ll start out with will be 0.8; 80%.</p>

<p>The next time we do this routine, we’ll find that the weights are significantly lower, and therefore much easier. Because you’re working through a range that you already know you can handle, you can progress much faster. Let’s try to work back to that previous 1RM in 4 sessions. We can do that if we increase the modifier by about 5.74% after each successful routine.</p>

<p>After working out way up to the old 1RM, we’ll hopefully find that we can now handle the weight. Then we can set the modifier back to 1 (no change) and start increasing the 1RM again.</p>

<p>The rules are simple:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Adjusted 1RM = 1RM * modifier</li>
  <li>Calculate all weights from Adjusted 1RM</li>
  <li>Fail? Multiply your modifier by 0.8</li>
  <li>Succeed with modifier &lt; 1? Multiply modifier by 1.0574</li>
  <li>Success with modifier &gt;= 1? Multiply 1RM by 1.01</li>
  <li>Modifier &gt; 1? Set modifier to 1</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>I have some python code that implements this and I may post some of it later.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="and-there-you-have-it">And there you have it!</h2>

<p>So that’s it. We use a simple feedback to tell us if we should increase the weight or decrease it. As long as we’re making gains, we creep along with 1% increments. If we hit our limit, we back up and work back up from 80% over the next 4 sessions. Hopefully, by the time we hit our previous limit again, we’ll be able to move past it.</p>
