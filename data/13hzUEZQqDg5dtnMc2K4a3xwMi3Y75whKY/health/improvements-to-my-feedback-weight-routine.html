      <article role="main" class="blog-post">
        <p>Not long ago, I posted about my weight-training routine and how I use a simple feedback system to control my weight progression. I laid out a simple system that increases weight by 1% after each successful workout, and cuts the weights back by 20% after every failure (followed by 5.74% increases until we catch back up to where we were when we failed).</p>

<p>As long as I’m completing all the reps of each set, the weight goes up by 1% each session. If I fail, the weights drop down to 80% of what they were in increase fast enough to get back to where I left off after 4 sessions. Then, if I can now handle that weight, the weight continues to increase at that 1% per session rate.</p>

<p>Let’s give names to these two phases:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Progress phase = making our standard 1% increase between sessions</li>
  <li>Recovery phase = we’ve decreased our weights by 80% and we’re quickly working our way back up to the last weight we couldn’t quite handle</li>
</ul>

<p>There are some problems with this and I have a few ideas about how to tweak the system for better performance in the long run.</p>

<h2 id="in-a-nutshell">In a nutshell</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Add a bonus modifier to increase or decrease the standard growth rate of 1%</li>
  <li>Add a feedback system to modify this bonus modifier in an attempt to hit a rate of 4 successful sessions before hitting failure</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="is-1-too-small-or-too-big">Is 1% too small or too big?</h2>

<p>As a percentage, an untrained person is going to be able to handle relatively large increases in weight between sessions. This is when people make the most rapid progress; when they’re just beginning.</p>

<p>But as athletes get closer and closer to their maximum potential, their progress slows down considerably.</p>

<p>This suggests to me that the ideal per-session increase in weight might start out much higher than 1% and then gradually decrease as you inch closer and closer to your maximum potential.</p>

<p>If we add a <em>bonus modifier</em> to each exercise, we can adjust the standard 1% increase up or down. We would calculate our new 1-rep-max as:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>New 1RM = Old 1RM * 1.01 * bonus mod
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="endless-success-or-planned-failure">Endless success or planned failure?</h2>

<p>One way we could tackle this problem is to try to adjust the bonus mod so that we constantly increase the weight from session to session and never hit failure.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this approach might bias us towards an unnecessarily slow rate of progress. If we start off at 1% and never hit failure, then it might be because we can handle much faster progress. We’d probably make more progress if we increased the weights faster.</p>

<p>Another possible downside to this approach is that if we get the per-session increase optimal, then we might find ourselves working near the top of our ability every single session. That can get grueling and we might find it hard to stick to that kind of routine.</p>

<p>What appeals to me, is to plan for failure; try to increase the weights at a rate such that we cycle through our progression and recovery phases at a predictable rate. I can’t point to any data or studies to support this, but it seems to me that it’ll be easier to work through the progress phase, if you know there will be a relatively easy recovery phase.</p>

<h2 id="one-half-progress-one-half-recovery">One half progress; one half recovery</h2>

<p>I think I’d like to succeed more often than fail, so I’d want to rig the system so that I experience that. But I don’t want to endlessly make small weight increments in order to acheive this. I think 4 recovery sessions followed by 4 progress sessions sounds pretty good to me. Of course, you can tweak this to whatever sounds good to you and adjust it if you find you don’t like your settings.</p>

<p>We’ll set up the recovery phase so that it would be 4 sessions long, so that means our goal for the progress phase would be 4 sessions too.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Since we track each exercise separately, that means that some can be in the progress phase, while others are in the recovery phase.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now we can plan some simple feedback mechanisms to try to hit 4 progress sessions.</p>

<h2 id="adding-another-feedback-loop">Adding another feedback loop</h2>

<p>So let’s start out with a <em>bonus modifier</em> of 1; which means no change. We’ll add a <em>progress counter</em> to our database for each exercise so that we can track how many times in a row we’ve made successful progress.</p>

<p>After each exercise:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If we succeeded and we’re not in the recovery phase, add 1 to the progress counter.</li>
  <li>If we fail, set the progress counter to 0.</li>
</ul>

<p>But actually, we’ll want to add some routines that alter the bonus modifier depending on what the progress counter is. If fail before 4 sessions, we’ll want to decrease the bonus modifier. As we succeed beyond 4 sessions, we’ll want to increase the bonus modifier.</p>

<p>After each exercise:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If we succeeded and we’re not in the recovery phase, add 1 to the progress counter.</li>
  <li>If we succeed and progress counter &gt; 4, increase bonus modifier by 5%.</li>
  <li>If we fail and progress counter &lt; 4 but &gt; 0, decrease bonus modifier by 5%</li>
  <li>If we fail, set the progress counter to 0.</li>
  <li>If in recovery phase, don’t touch the bonus modifier.</li>
</ul>

<p>I chose 5% increments and decrements arbitrarily. It’s a compromise between adjusting the numbers quickly (larger adjustments) and accurately (smaller adjustments). You could start out with a larger number and then decrease it over time.</p>

<p>N.B.: If the progress counter is still 0 when we fail, that means our recovery phase wasn’t enough. We failed again at the same weight we failed at before. It probably doesn’t make sense to worry about your rate of progress in the progress phase when this happens.</p>

<h2 id="dynamic-equilibrium">Dynamic equilibrium</h2>

<p>What we should see with this system is that after an initial break-in period, we’ll find ourselves alternating between greater than 4 sessions of progress and less than 4 sessions of progress; each time followed by 4 sessions of recovery.</p>

<p>The long-term average should work out to 4 sessions of progress and (of course) 4 sessions of recovery.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This assumes we don’t have any injuries or illnesses that screw with our progress.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And all this with really only one piece of binary feedback.</p>
