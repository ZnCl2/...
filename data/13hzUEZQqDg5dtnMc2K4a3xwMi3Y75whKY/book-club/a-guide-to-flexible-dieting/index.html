<h2 id="buttercups-review">Buttercup’s Review</h2>

<p>This book is strong on the issue of how to structure dieting to make it
something you can stick to. Lyle makes a strong case that a traditional rigid
mentality towards dieting backfires in the not-even-that-long run.</p>

<p>The basic strategy is to take planed breaks from the diet; breaks where you
would be eating maintenance calories. So you would diet for four weeks and
then eat at maintenance for two; something like that.</p>

<p>He also promotes <em>free</em> (he doesn’t like to call them ‘cheat’) meals about
once a week. And he promotes ‘re-feeds’, which he’s less convinced of nowadays
unless you’re already quite lean.</p>

<h2 id="description">Description</h2>

<p>When most people diet, they take a fairly all or nothing approach. They expect
100% perfection and any slip up, no matter how minor, tends to derail their
dieting efforts.</p>

<p>Of course, the statistics show that most people will fail on a diet, regaining
all of the lost weight and frequently more. That alone suggests that the type
of extreme (let’s call it rigid) approach to dieting does more harm than good.</p>

<p>But research also suggests that flexible dieters, folks who take a more
relaxed approach to their eating habits tend to weigh less and have less binge
eating episodes; they do better in the long run.</p>

<p>A Guide to Flexible Dieting explains how the types of typical extremist
approaches to losing weight do more harm than good. It explains how being more
flexible, and how deliberately breaking your diet, can actually make it work
more effectively in the long run.</p>

<p>A Guide to Flexible Dieting is not a diet book in the typical sense. Rather,
it deals with some behavioral strategies that can help make your diet work
more effectively.</p>

<h2 id="buttercups-highlights">Buttercup’s Highlights</h2>

<p>These notes were produced from a MOBI version of a book that was originally in PDF format. Calibre was used to convert the PDF to MOBI format. Calibre often does a pretty good job, but the result is never the same as the official kindle version. Therefore, the kindle locations of each highlight may not match those of the official version.</p>
