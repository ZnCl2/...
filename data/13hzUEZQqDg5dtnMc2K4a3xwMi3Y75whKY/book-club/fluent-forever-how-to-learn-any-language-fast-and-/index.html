<h2 id="buttercups-review">Buttercup’s Review</h2>

<p>Wyner does a great job of covering the mechanics behind how to memorize
foreign-language vocabulary and grammar using spaced-repetition software
(Anki), and the basic approach he uses to learn a new language. All the advice
is very practical and Wyner has done a lot to show people how to create
effective cards in Anki.</p>

<p>Wyner covers all the bases of efficient straight-forward repitition-based
learning techniques, but he does a decent job with the more abstract mnemonic
device techniques as well. Most memory gurus focus on one or the onther;
either full mnemonics, or full spaced-repetition. Wyner provides a pretty good
balance of the two, which is rare.</p>

<p>Modern how-to-learn-a-language books tend to avoid topics of memorization and
explicit grammar like the plague. These have fallen out of fashion and books
that promise that you can learn a language without the hard work of memorizing
its vocabulary or explicitly studying its grammar are what currently sells.
But this is snake-oil bullshit. Wyner’s book offers a refreshing effeciency-
focused approach.</p>

<h2 id="description">Description</h2>

<p>Memory is the greatest challenge to learning a foreign language; there are
just too many words and too many rules. For every new word we learn, we seem
to forget two old ones, making fluency seem out of reach.</p>

<p><em>Fluent Forever</em> tackles this challenge head-on. Starting with pronunciation,
you’ll learn how to rewire your ears and turn foreign sounds into familiar
sounds. And with the help of sophisticated spaced-repetition techniques,
you’ll be able to memorize hundreds of words a month in minutes every day.
This is brain hacking at its most exciting, taking what we know about
neuroscience and linguistics and using it to create the most efficient and
enjoyable way to learn a foreign language in the spare minutes of your day.</p>
