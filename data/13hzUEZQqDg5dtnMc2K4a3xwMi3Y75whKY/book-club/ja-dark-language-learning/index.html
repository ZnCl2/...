<h2 id="buttercups-review">Buttercup’s Review</h2>

<p>This is a collection of articles by JA-Dark. He had a very scholarly,
research-based approach to learning foreign language and wrote articles that
focused mainly on using Anki (spaced repetition software) efficiently.</p>

<p>He seems to no-longer be active on the web and most of his articles have
disappeared except for on sites such as the Internet Archive.</p>

<h2 id="description">Description</h2>

<p>Good psych info. Focus on Japanese, but mostly relevant to other stuff.</p>
