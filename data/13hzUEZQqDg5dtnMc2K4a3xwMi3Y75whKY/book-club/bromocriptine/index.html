<h2 id="count-rugens-review">Count Rugen’s Review</h2>

<p>Lyle McDonald explains that one of the things that makes dieting (and
remaining lean) so difficult is the decreased metabolic rate and increased
hunger that comes with lower leptin levels. Leptin is a hormone made by fat
cells, so as you lose fat, it decreases (which causes the metabolic slowdown
and increased hunger).</p>

<p>While supplementing with leptin isn’t practical (it would have to be
injected), mimiking leptin’s effects is possible. Leptin increases dopamine
levels in the brain, and this seems to be it’s mechanism of action.</p>

<p>Bromocriptine is a dopamine receptor agonist, and can be used to maintain
normal metabolism and hunger levels while dieting.</p>

<p>McDonald describes the relevant biochemistry well and gives you a lot of leads
for further research. For example, bupropion (a dopamine re-uptake inhibitor)
has similar effects and may either replace or supplement bromocriptine use for
this purpose. (McDonald’s internet forum contains a lot more on the subject.)</p>

<p>This is a short, but very interesting read. McDonald gives us a
pharmocological tool for sticking with a diet and keeping it effective. This
pairs well with his <em>Flexible Dieting</em> book, which concentrates on structuring
your diet for a similar effect.</p>
