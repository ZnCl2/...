<h2 id="buttercups-review">Buttercup’s Review</h2>

<p>As usual, with the people’s chemist, there’s some good information here.
Footnotes are there to check out his sources.</p>

<p>Each chapter boils down to one or two supplementation reccomendations. I wish
he’d get to the point and just list them in the beginning. Instead you’ll wade
through descriptions of the problem, problems with prescription meds, and
occasionally the familiar trope of describing some friend/client of the author
who had the problem and then the author’s brilliant advice made everything
better.</p>

<p>I noticed a few mistakes here and there which make me question whether he got
everything else right, but you can always follow up on his sources. (e.g. He
claims Wellbutrin is a selective seritonin re-uptake inhibitor, while it’s
actually a norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor; that’s a big mistake in
my book.)</p>

<h2 id="key-recommendations">Key Recommendations</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Antioxidants/Skincare: 4mg/kg ALA (bonus add acetyl-L-carnitine)</li>
  <li>Cholesterol: L-arginine, grape-seed extract, at least 500 mg folate/folic acid + other B vitamins (brewer’s yeast is a good source)</li>
  <li>Blood Pressure/Clots: Hawthorn (1-3% bioflavanoids) 15-20 mg/kg 2-3x/day; 500-1,000 mg Magnesium</li>
  <li>Insomnia: Valerian 500mg/40 lb body weight 1 hour before bed.</li>
  <li>Illnesses: Eat a raw garlic clove 3 times a day; Andrographis (standardized 4-6%) 500-1,000 mg with food.</li>
  <li>Blood Sugar/Obesity: Cinnamon before every meal; water + lemon juice between meals to curb hunger.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="description">Description</h2>

<p>Pay Less. Live Healthier.</p>

<p>Stop Taking Worthless Prescription Drugs and Overhyped Supplements that
Sabotage Your Health.</p>

<p>Americans are under attack. Obesity, lethargy, diabetes, heart disease, and
cancer are ghastly epidemics. Worse, most drugs can make you even more sick!
Why is this happening? Because no one tells you the truth: Millions of dollars
are made by keeping this forbidden knowledge from you. Not anymore!</p>

<p>Shane Ellison–known as The People’s Chemist by his thousands of readers–
knows the truth. A former chemist for Big Pharma, he quit when he discovered
that the drugs he was creating for drug companies were nothing but toxins, and
that the real cures could be found on every supermarket and superstore shelf–
for a fraction of the cost and without a prescription!</p>

<p>Over-the-Counter Natural Cures is your insider guide to the inexpensive, easy
ways to dramatically boost your health in less than 30 days…and stay fit and
lean forever!</p>
