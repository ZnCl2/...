<h2 id="buttercups-review">Buttercup’s Review</h2>

<p>Loved it. Great explanation of how the current <em>progressive</em> movement in
education continues to fail.</p>

<h2 id="buttercups-highlights">Buttercup’s Highlights</h2>

<p>| <strong>Kindle Location</strong> | <strong>Highlight</strong> |
| 64 | our  students perform relatively worse on international comparisons the  longer they stay in our schools.
 |
| 64 | In fourth grade, American students  score ninth in reading among thirty-five countries, which is respectable.   By tenth grade they score fifteenth in reading among twenty-seven   countries,
 |
| 77 | Verbal SAT scores in the United States took a nosedive in the  i96os, and since then they have remained flat.
 |
| 83 | For Hispanics,   it is a depressing 85 percent, and for blacks it is a tragic 88  percent.4
 |
| 100 | The word natural has been a term of honor in our  country ever since our forebears elevated “nature” and “natural” to a  status that had earlier been occupied by divine law.
 |
| 104 | The fundamental idea of romanticism is that there isn’t any  boundary between the natural and the divine.
 |
| 114 | historians don’t always call these ideas romanticism.  They have given them special American names. They call Emerson  and Thoreau “Transcendentalists.” They call John Dewey, the father  of present-day American education, a “pragmatist” or a “progressive.”
 |
| 120 | unnoticed  metaphors like “growth” and “development” unconsciously govern  our thought
 |
| 140 | Scholars   are still debating whether or not alphabetic writing was invented  only once in human history12
 |
| 142 | reading is developmentally inappropriate at all ages of human  life.
 |
| 145 | A naturalistic approach to teaching phonics, under the idea that children   are somehow wired to master the alphabetic code,
 |
| 146 | The word reading has two senses, often   confusingly lumped together. The first means the process of turning   printed marks into sounds and these sounds into words. But the  second sense means the very different process of understanding those  words.
 |
| 150 | Disparagement of factual knowledge as found in books has been  a strong current in American thought since the time of Emerson.
 |
| 153 | In our pre-romantic days, books were seen as the key to education.
 |
| 156 | The Romantics rejected such advice. They opposed the reading  of books as unnatural, as arising from the artificial habits and constraints   of civilization.
 |
| 158 | Emerson claimed that the farm was a better teacher than the school:
 |
| 160 | John Dewey’s Lab School,  which he started in Chicago in 1896, was based on the conviction that
children would learn what they needed by engaging in practical activities   such as cooking.
 |
| 161 | Today our schools and colleges of education, the inheritors of  these ideas, are still the nerve centers of an anti-intellectual tradition.
 |
| 162 | One of their most effective rhetorical tics is to identify the acquisition   of broad knowledge with “rote learning” of “mere facts”
 |
| 163 | Just like Rousseau,   Wordsworth, and Dewey, our schools of education hold that unless   school knowledge is connected to “real life” in a “hands-on” way,  it is unnatural and dead; it is “rote” and “meaningless.”
 |
| 165 | nobody advocates rote learning of disconnected  facts. Neither Milton nor Thomas Jefferson nor any of their more  thoughtful contemporaries who championed book learning advocated   rote learning.
 |
| 166 | What they did advocate was the systematic acquisition   of broad knowledge.
 |
| 169 | A deficit of factual knowledge and the deficit  in language it entails are the causes of the so-called fourth-grade  slump that many children experience.”
 |
| 170 | scores well in reading in  grades one through three but surprisingly begins to score badly in  grade four.
 |
| 171 | because in the early grades she was mainly learning how to decode
 |
| 172 | But in grade four,
 |
| 173 | her limited comprehension of language   began to show.
 |
| 174 | this failure most seriously limits her progress in later elementary   grades, in middle school, in high school, and in later life.
 |
| 175 | Children   who lag in comprehension in early grades tend to fall even  further behind in later years.18 For children to make substantial progress   in reading, they must make early and substantial progress in  knowledge.
 |
| 184 | a good education can indeed create skilled  readers and critical thinkers. The mistake is to think that these  achievements are the result of formal, all-purpose skills rather than  abilities that are completely dependent on broad factual knowledge.
 |
| 211 | The failure of romantic ideas to improve educational achievement is  an inevitable result of their scientific inadequacy and inaccuracy.
 |
| 234 | To those  who argue that the solution lies in hiring better teachers, I respond  that much of the talk about low teacher quality is misplaced. If teachers   now lack the knowledge they need to teach reading and other subjects   well, it is not because they are innately incompetent but because  they have been trained under faulty romantic ideas about the nature  of reading and the worthlessness of “mere information.”
 |
| 235 | If teachers   now lack the knowledge they need to teach reading and other subjects   well, it is not because they are innately incompetent but because  they have been trained under faulty romantic ideas about the nature  of reading and the worthlessness of “mere information.”
 |
| 242 | Programs that cost publishers tens of  millions of dollars to produce and schools hundreds of millions to  buy are constantly being upgraded and revised.
 |
| 244 | Although the editors of several of these programs have strong  credentials in education or psychology, the programs are far from up-to-date   with regard to the relevant consensus in cognitive science.
 |
| 245 | Cognitive scientists agree that  reading comprehension requires prior “domain-specific” knowledge  about the things that a text refers to, and that understanding the text  consists of integrating this prior knowledge with the words in order  to form a “situation model.””
 |
| 246 | Constructing this mental situation  model is what reading comprehension is.
 |
| 248 | The reading problem can be solved if our schools begin to follow   alternative ideas that stress the importance of a gradual acquisition   of broad, enabling knowledge.
 |
| 255 | Most citizens support the goals of NCLB,
 |
| 256 | But support for the law has begun to diminish, because it has  proved immensely difficult for the schools to fulfill its key requirement   that all demographic groups must make “adequate yearly progress”
 |
| 258 | many schools have  found it nearly impossible to show adequate yearly progress in reading   for all groups, even when subjects like history and science are being   neglected
 |
| 259 | outcry   against the act, and also against the yearly tests that measure  progress. The U.S. Department of Education has been compelled to  soften its requirements.
 |
| 260 | No situation better illustrates the importance of theories in education   than this practical impasse.
 |
| 282 | American ed school ideas march under the  banner of continual reform, but the reform, given different names in  different eras, is always the same one, being carried out against the  same enemy.
 |
| 284 | (naturalism).
 |
| 285 | (formalism).
 |
| 285 | are the two perennial ideas of the American educational world.
 |
| 286 | an adherence to the  formalistic idea - the how-to notion of reading comprehension that  stresses clarifying, summarizing, questioning - will inevitably lead  to drill-like activities, which will be anathematized by the naturalistic
principle that learning should be an engaging activity.
 |
| 288 | This inherent  conflict leads in turn to resentment of the idea that the children  should be constantly tested,
 |
| 294 | the only way to improve scores in  reading comprehension and to narrow the reading gap between  groups is systematically to provide children with the wide-ranging,  specific background knowledge they need to comprehend what they  read.
 |
| 295 | Old people grow blunt; they haven’t time for slow niceties.
 |
| 310 | the best and fastest way to teach decoding   is through persistent, explicit instruction, a little at a time,
starting no later than kindergarten.
 |
| 314 | Marion  Joseph has been credited with turning the entire school system of  California (and the publishers who sell books to California) toward  the systematic and explicit teaching of the alphabetic/phonemic system
 |
| 343 | The crucial years for gaining a good start in language are the  early years.’
 |
| 344 | In recent decades, since reading has been misconceived  as a separate skill, there has been a relative neglect of enhancing oral  language in the early years of schooling
 |
| 347 | At the youngest ages, two through seven, long  before children can read as well as they can listen, progress in language   occurs chiefly through listening and talking, not through reading   and writing.
 |
| 354 | If we do  not spend large amounts of time reading aloud and discussing challenging   material with children - material that is well beyond their  ability to decode with understanding - we miss a critical opportunity   to increase their knowledge of language and of the world
 |
| 359 | The way we process   the written word and the way we process the spoken word are essentially   the same.
 |
| 373 | It is precisely for the sake of reading and writing that we need to  place a great deal of emphasis in the early grades on nonwritten, oral  activities
 |
| 375 | it is essential for young children to become   familiar with the more public genres of oral speech, which are  the main genres of reading and writing.
 |
| 402 | As a parent or teacher, we can help our children grasp what reading  and writing are like by practicing pretend radio or other audience-directed   speeches.
 |
| 405 | because it  enacts the communicative situation of reading and writing without  involving the arduous process of learning to sound out and form letters   accurately and fluently.
 |
| 407 | difference between formal speech  and ordinary conversation. The distinction is an essential feature of  learning to function in a speech community. Real conversations are  often incomprehensible to listeners who happen to be unaware of  the specific context
 |
| 418 | Early reading programs in the  schools have paid too little attention to instruction in the special conventions   and obligations that must constrain speakers and listeners  in public situations.
 |
| 421 | The perfection   of written communication by means of a clear prose style took  quite a long time. In English it took two centuries, from 1500 to  1700.15
 |
| 425 | something quite  fundamental about reading and writing - that what counts is not  whether the speech is recorded in print or via computer, encoded in  radio waves, or produced as vibrations of air molecules from mouth  to ear. Psychologically, all of these must pass through the “phonological   loop.” What counts most from the standpoint of language  comprehension is the kind of utterance that is being engaged in  and whether the audience has the background knowledge, including  knowledge of speech conventions, they need to comprehend it.
 |
| 429 | Effective speech on radio and TV, whether monologue, dialogue,  or drama, always clues in the listener to what is needed to make  the speech comprehensible
 |
| 431 | Children need to learn  that when they have to address a big, heterogeneous audience, such as  a classroom full of peers, they have to be more explicit both in syntax  and in overtly stated background knowledge.16
 |
| 432 | gradually gain a sense of what others in  their speech community take for granted.
 |
| 433 | In view of the inseparability of oral and written speech, neglecting   intensive formal oral language enhancement during the long  hours devoted to reading in the early grades has been more than a  missed opportunity;
 |
| 436 | It  is in early language learning that the Matthew effect begins to take  hold. Those who know many words and who possess the background
knowledge to comprehend what they mean will learn more words  and world knowledge later on,
 |
| 446 | decoding fluency in grade four, when our children’s scores are moderately   high by international standards, does not automatically develop   into comprehension fluency in grade twelve, when our students’   scores are low.”
 |
| 452 | there does indeed exist  such a thing as general reading skill - a general ability to understand  a wide diversity of texts.
 |
| 453 | general reading skill  applies only to texts that are consciously directed to a general audience   within a definite speech community.
 |
| 460 | what counts in understanding a text (once  it has been verbally decoded) is not, as is supposed in current reading
 programs, a general working vocabulary plus some comprehension   strategies. General reading comprehension ability is much more  than comprehension strategies; it requires a definite range of general  knowledge.
 |
| 467 | Researchers have discovered that what the text implies but  doesn’t say is a necessary part of its understood meaning.
 |
| 469 | The  ancient Greeks knew it, and Aristotle even gave the phenomenon a  name - enthymeme, which is technically a syllogism with some of  the logically necessary steps left out.20
 |
| 473 | The ability to fill in these blanks  depends entirely on whether children know what is to be filled in.
 |
| 474 | Speed is  important, because a person can keep in mind only a very few items  at a time, which means that richness of meaning is gained by condensing   ordinary oral speech.
 |
| 475 | Written speech is the same, only less so.
 |
| 476 | It is more explicit, because writers know that  they must make it so in order to be understood. But writing always  leaves a great deal unsaid.
 |
| 491 | relevant, domain-specific knowledge is  an absolute requirement for reading comprehension,
 |
| 492 | need for children to gain broad general knowledge in order   to gain broad general proficiency in reading.
 |
| 492 | According to received views in the American educational community,   no specific background knowledge is needed for reading.
 |
| 493 | This innocent-sounding  idea, so liberating to the teacher and the student, frees the American
school from any requirement to teach a specific body of knowledge.
 |
| 523 | The status quo asserts that offering  students different kinds of writings will automatically prepare them  to read different kinds of texts,
 |
| 524 | The practical result is that early reading programs offer   the child a fragmented series of readings with little sustained information   or coherence.
 |
| 525 | I believe that this indifference to  specific, cumulative subject matter, more than any other single trait  of reading programs, has prevented them from significantly improving   reading comprehension.
 |
