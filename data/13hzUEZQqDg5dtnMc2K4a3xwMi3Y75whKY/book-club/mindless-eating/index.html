<h2 id="count-rugens-review">Count Rugen’s Review</h2>

<p>Very interesting foray into the psychology of eating behavior and how we can
hack it.</p>

<p>You’ve probably heard of some of Wansink’s research already since it make the
news every once in a while.</p>

<p>Wansink makes a strong case that no-one has a phisiological state of
<em>fullness</em>. Instead, you have three settings: starving, could eat more, and
absolutely stuffed. Instead, most of eating behavior is psychological; not
phisiological.</p>

<p>There are a lot of techniques in this book to trick your brain into either
being aware of how much you’ve actually eaten (e.g. leave scraps where you can
see them instead of bussing the table), or thinking that you’ve eating more
than you really are (use smaller plates).</p>

<p>Obviously, there are a lot of other things to focus on if you want to lose
fat, but it’s helpful to have these psychological tricks in your toolbox.</p>

<h2 id="description">Description</h2>

<p>This book will literally change the way you think about your next meal. Food
psychologist Brian Wansink revolutionizes our awareness of how much, what, and
why we’re eating–often without realizing it. His findings will astound you.</p>

<p>• Can the size of your plate really influence your appetite?<br />
• Why do you eat more when you dine with friends?<br />
• What “hidden persuaders” are used by restaurants and supermarkets to get us
to overeat?<br />
• How does music or the color of the room influence how much–and how fast–we
eat?<br />
• How can we “mindlessly” lose–instead of gain–up to twenty pounds in the
coming year?</p>

<p>Starting today, you can make more mindful, enjoyable, and healthy choices at
the dinner table, in the supermarket, at the office–wherever you satisfy your
appetite.</p>
