<h2 id="buttercups-review">Buttercup’s Review</h2>

<p>There’s a lot of <strong>great</strong> material in this book and not that much fluff or
filler material. Study this book and you’ll know more about learning than 99%
of the population.</p>

<p>I’d say this along with <em>Moonwalking with Einstein</em> provide a solid
introduction to learning how to study efficiently. <em>Moonwalking</em> provides an
introduction to mnemonics and this book provides a solid foundation in the
more mechanical aspects of learning such as spaced repetition, and interleving
different subjects.</p>

<p>The ideal follow-up would be a book that combines the two worlds of mnemonics
and, let’s call it <em>mechanics</em>. <em>Fluent Forever</em> comes very close to being
such a book, but it’s geared more toward learning a foreign language than to
learning in general. Still, Fluent Forever provides examples of how to
incorporate mnemonic devices within the structure of a spaced repetition
program.</p>

<p>Perhaps I’ll take a crack at writing a book that combines the two.</p>

<p>Follow up the previous three books with a book on habit formation, and you can
make your spaced repetiton reviews a lasting habit rather than a passing fad.</p>

<p>There is a book called <em>Habit</em> , and the first chapter or so is good. Then
there’s a lot of fluff and then an appendix where the author shows you how to
put what he talks about into practice. Cut out the fluff in the middle and you
have a great book on forming new habits.</p>

<h2 id="description">Description</h2>

<p>In the tradition of The Power of Habit and Thinking, Fast and Slow comes a
practical, playful, and endlessly fascinating guide to what we really know
about learning and memory today—and how we can apply it to our own lives. From
an early age, it is drilled into our heads: Restlessness, distraction, and
ignorance are the enemies of success. We’re told that learning is all self-
discipline, that we must confine ourselves to designated study areas, turn off
the music, and maintain a strict ritual if we want to ace that test, memorize
that presentation, or nail that piano recital. But what if almost everything
we were told about learning is wrong? And what if there was a way to achieve
more with less effort? In How We Learn, award-winning science reporter
Benedict Carey sifts through decades of education research and landmark
studies to uncover the truth about how our brains absorb and retain
information. What he discovers is that, from the moment we are born, we are
all learning quickly, efficiently, and automatically; but in our zeal to
systematize the process we have ignored valuable, naturally enjoyable learning
tools like forgetting, sleeping, and daydreaming. Is a dedicated desk in a
quiet room really the best way to study? Can altering your routine improve
your recall? Are there times when distraction is good? Is repetition
necessary? Carey’s search for answers to these questions yields a wealth of
strategies that make learning more a part of our everyday lives—and less of a
chore. By road testing many of the counterintuitive techniques described in
this book, Carey shows how we can flex the neural muscles that make deep
learning possible. Along the way he reveals why teachers should give final
exams on the first day of class, why it’s wise to interleave subjects and
concepts when learning any new skill, and when it’s smarter to stay up late
prepping for that presentation than to rise early for one last cram session.
And if this requires some suspension of disbelief, that’s because the research
defies what we’ve been told, throughout our lives, about how best to learn.
The brain is not like a muscle, at least not in any straightforward sense. It
is something else altogether, sensitive to mood, to timing, to circadian
rhythms, as well as to location and environment. It doesn’t take orders well,
to put it mildly. If the brain is a learning machine, then it is an eccentric
one. In How We Learn, Benedict Carey shows us how to exploit its quirks to our
advantage. Praise for How We Learn“This book is a revelation. I feel as if
I’ve owned a brain for fifty-four years and only now discovered the operating
manual.”—Mary Roach, bestselling author of Stiff and Gulp“A welcome rejoinder
to the faddish notion that learning is all about the hours put in.”—The New
York Times Book Review “A valuable, entertaining tool for educators, students
and parents.”—Shelf Awareness “How We Learn is more than a new approach to
learning; it is a guide to making the most out of life. Who wouldn’t be
interested in that?”—Scientific American “I know of no other source that pulls
together so much of what we know about the science of memory and couples it
with practical, practicable advice.”—Daniel T. Willingham, professor of
psychology at the University of VirginiaFrom the Hardcover edition.</p>
