<p>PSMF 8-12 weeks on; 2 weeks at maintenance.</p>

<p>Add 6g fish oil, K, Mg, and a multivitamin.</p>

<h2 id="description">Description</h2>

<p>In an ideal world, everyone would take a long-term approach to dieting, trying
to lose weight/fat gradually. They’d make small changes to their eating
habits, activity patterns, or both. But we don’t live in an ideal world there
are situations when that simply won’t work. Or where people simply aren’t
willing to be patient. Maybe they need to drop weight fast for a special
event, or they are an athlete or bodybuilder who has to get in shape and is
under a time crunch. Maybe they just want the diet over as quickly as
possible. Whatever the case, sometimes you need a way to drop both weight and
fat quickly to reach your goals. That’s where The Rapid Fat Loss Handbook: A
Scientific Approach to Crash Dieting comes in.</p>

<h2 id="count-rugens-highlights">Count Rugen’s Highlights</h2>

<p>These notes were produced from a MOBI version of a book that was originally in PDF format. Calibre was used to convert the PDF to MOBI format. Calibre often does a pretty good job, but the result is never the same as the official kindle version. Therefore, the kindle locations of each highlight may not match those of the official version.</p>
