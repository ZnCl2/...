<h2 id="count-rugens-review">Count Rugen’s Review</h2>

<p>Interesting and compelling case for the importance of getting enough iodine in
your diet. Of course, we allready knew this was important.</p>

<p>His conclusion about how much iodine you should take on a daily basis goes
against the consensus of the medical establishment, and there is some evidence
that he made a large error in interpreting the Japanese data. Also, there
doesn’t seem to be any hard evidence for his urine-testing protocol to detect
iodine defficiency.</p>

<p>Although, I found this an interesting read, I can’t recommend it because I
suspect his conclusions about the amount of iodine you should take daily are
unfounded. I actually tried taking the large doses he suggested for a while,
but I had trouble sleeping; I kept salivating all the time.</p>

<h2 id="description">Description</h2>

<p>Iodine is the most misunderstood nutrient. After 17 years of practicing
medicine, I can say that it is impossible to achieve your optimal health if
you do not have adequate iodine levels.</p>

<p>I have yet to see any item that is more important to promoting health or
optimizing the function of the immune system than iodine.</p>

<p>Learn what forms of iodine you need and why there is not enough iodine in
salt. See how iodine can help: breast cancer, fibrocystic breast disease,
detoxification, fatigue, Graves’ disease, and Hashimoto’s disease.</p>

<p>Find out why iodine deficiency may be the root cause of thyroid problems
including hypothyroidism and thyroid cancer. Discover how to get iodine in
your diet and improve your immune system.</p>
