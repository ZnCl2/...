<h2 id="buttercups-review">Buttercup’s Review</h2>

<p>7-day cycle combining diet and training shed bodyfat below 12-15% (when it
becomes much harder to lose fat).</p>

<p>At 15% body fat and above, use Lyle’s Rapid Fat Loss Protocol, or a standard
caloric deficit to shed bodyfat. Follow his flexible dieting techniques,
having a cheat meal once a week and taking a two-week break (where you eat at
maintenance) after 8-10 weeks of dieting.</p>

<p>Below 12-15%, fat loss becomes increasingly difficult for many people, so
McDonald puts together a lot of techniques into a 7-day cycle to hold on to as
much muscle as possible while shedding fat down to sub-ten-percent levels.</p>

<p>How well it works, I can’t say. But Lyle is the man when it comes to fat loss,
so this is something I’ll be trying soon.</p>

<p>Lyle’s prose describes everything, but the book is missing a good outline of
the entire cycle. So I made one</p>

<h2 id="description">Description</h2>

<p><strong>From Amazon:</strong></p>

<p>The Ultimate Diet 2.0 represents both a very old and very new approach to the
problems of dieting to low bodyfat percentages.</p>

<p>It is old in that it builds upon an approach originally developed in the early
80’s by bodybuilding guru Dan Duchaine and researcher Michael Zumpano. It is
new in that it applies the most cutting edge research to that plan, optimizing
it to the greatest degree possible.</p>

<p>The Ultimate Diet 2.0 is aimed at advanced dieters and athletes who want to
move from ordinary to extraordinary. It will allow dieters to lose 1-1.5 lbs
of fat per week with no muscle loss (some dieters gain muscle). It allows
athletes to maintain or improve performance while losing bodyfat. It can also
be used to gain muscle with minimal bodyfat gains.</p>

<p>These notes were produced from a MOBI version of a book that was originally in PDF format. Calibre was used to convert the PDF to MOBI format. Calibre often does a pretty good job, but the result is never the same as the official kindle version.
