<h2 id="buttercups-review">Buttercup’s Review</h2>

<p>This is a very interesting read and provides a lot to think about for parents.
Chua is brutally honest about the good and the bad of her approach as a
mother.</p>

<p>Not a how-to guide, more of an interesting memior. I found myself agreeing
with a lot of her attitudes and laghing at how over-the-top she is about some
things.</p>

<p>This also provides an interesting insight into the differences between Chinese
and Western cultures.</p>

<h2 id="description">Description</h2>

<p><strong>“[E]ntertaining, bracingly honest and, yes, thought-provoking.”</strong> – ** <em>The
New York Times Book Review</em>**</p>

<p>At once provocative and laugh-out-loud funny, <em>Battle Hymn of the Tiger
Mother</em> ignited a global parenting debate with its story of one mother’s
journey in strict parenting. Amy Chua argues that Western parenting tries to
respect and nurture children’s individuality, while Chinese parents typically
believe that arming children with skills, strong work habits, and inner
confidence prepares them best for the future. <em>Battle Hymn of the Tiger
Mother</em> chronicles Chua’s iron-willed decision to raise her daughters, Sophia
and Lulu, the Chinese way – and the remarkable, sometimes heartbreaking
results her choice inspires. Achingly honest and profoundly challenging,
<em>Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother</em> is one of the most talked-about books of our
times.</p>

<p><em>_“Few have the guts to parent in public. Amy [Chua]’s memoir is brutally
honest, and her willingness to share her struggles is a gift. Whether or not
you agree with her priorities and approach, she should be applauded for
raising these issues with a thoughtful, humorous and authentic voice.” –</em> Time
_Magazine</p>

<p>“[A] riveting read… Chua’s story is far more complicated and interesting than
what you’ve heard to date – and well worth picking up… I guarantee that if
you read the book, there’ll undoubtedly be places where you’ll cringe in
recognition, and others where you’ll tear up in empathy.” – <em>San Francisco
Chronicle</em></p>

<p>“ <em>Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother</em> hit the parenting hot button, but also a
lot more, including people’s complicated feelings about ambition,
intellectualism, high culture, the Ivy League, strong women and America’s
standing in a world where China is ascendant. Chua’s conviction that hard work
leads to inner confidence is a resonant one.” – <em>Chicago Tribune</em></p>

<p>“Readers will alternately gasp at and empathize with Chua’s struggles and
aspirations, all the while enjoying her writing, which, like her kid-rearing
philosophy, is brisk, lively and no-holds-barred. This memoir raises
intriguing, sometimes uncomfortable questions about love, pride, ambition,
achievement and self-worth that will resonate among success-obsessed parents…
Readers of all stripes will respond to <em>[Battle Hymn of the] Tiger Mother</em>.” –
<em>The Washington Post</em> **</p>

<p>**</p>

<h3 id="from-publishers-weekly">From Publishers Weekly</h3>

<p>Chua (Day of Empire) imparts the secret behind the stereotypical Asian child’s
phenomenal success: the Chinese mother. Chua promotes what has traditionally
worked very well in raising children: strict, Old World, uncompromising values
–and the parents don’t have to be Chinese. What they are, however, are
different from what she sees as indulgent and permissive Western parents:
stressing academic performance above all, never accepting a mediocre grade,
insisting on drilling and practice, and instilling respect for authority. Chua
and her Jewish husband (both are professors at Yale Law) raised two girls, and
her account of their formative years achieving amazing success in school and
music performance proves both a model and a cautionary tale. Sophia, the
eldest, was dutiful and diligent, leapfrogging over her peers in academics and
as a Suzuki piano student; Lulu was also gifted, but defiant, who excelled at
the violin but eventually balked at her mother’s pushing. Chua’s efforts “not
to raise a soft, entitled child” will strike American readers as a little
scary–removing her children from school for extra practice, public shaming
and insults, equating Western parenting with failure–but the results, she
claims somewhat glibly in this frank, unapologetic report card, “were hard to
quarrel with.” (Jan.)<br />

<h3 id="from-bookmarks-magazine">From Bookmarks Magazine</h3>

<p>Most critics agreed that <em>Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother</em> is an entertaining
read—lively and humorous, written with the intent to shock. More controversial
is Chua’s stereotyping of Chinese and Western cultures, not to mention her
authoritarian parenting methods. Critics judged the book largely by asking the
following questions: Should self-esteem come before accomplishment, or
accomplishment before self-esteem? If the latter, should it be achieved by
threats and constant monitoring? Chua’s teenage daughters are undeniably
accomplished, but at what emotional cost? While some reviewers found that
Chua’s technique borders on abuse and her writing was, at best, self-serving,
others were impressed by her parenting results and opined that the West could
learn a few things from this remarkably driven Chinese American mother.</p>
