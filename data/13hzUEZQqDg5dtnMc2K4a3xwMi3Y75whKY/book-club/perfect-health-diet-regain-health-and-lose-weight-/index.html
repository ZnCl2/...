<h2 id="buttercups-review">Buttercup’s Review</h2>

<p>Hands-down my all-time favorite diet/nutrition book!</p>

<p>I’ve read enough diet books that most of them bore me to death; it’s the same
stuff over and over. Not this one. This book was a fascinating page-turner. I
couldn’t put it down.</p>

<p>The Jaminet’s have a very different (and very scientific) approach and one
that really appeals to me.</p>

<h2 id="description">Description</h2>

<p>Suffering from chronic illness and unable to get satisfactory results from
doctors, husband and wife scientists Paul and Shou-Ching Jaminet took an
intensely personal interest in health and nutrition. They embarked on five
years of rigorous research. What they found changed their lives-and the lives
of thousands of their readers.In Perfect Health Diet, the Jaminets explain in
layman’s terms how anyone can regain health and lose weight by optimizing
nutrition, detoxifying the diet, and supporting healthy immune function. They
show how toxic, nutrient-poor diets sabotage health, and how on a healthy
diet, diseases often spontaneously resolve.Perfect Health Diet tells you
exactly how to optimize health and make weight loss effortless with a clear,
balanced, and scientifically proven plan to change the way you eat-and feel-
forever.</p>

<p>These notes were produced from a MOBI version of a book that was originally in PDF format. Calibre was used to convert the PDF to MOBI format. Calibre often does a pretty good job, but the result is never the same as the official kindle version. Therefore, the kindle locations of each highlight may not match those of the official version.</p>
