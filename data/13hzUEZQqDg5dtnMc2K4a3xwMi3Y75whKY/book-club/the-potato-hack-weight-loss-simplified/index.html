<h2 id="count-rugens-review">Count Rugen’s Review</h2>

<p>Steele tells a short history of the potato as food; from it’s domestication in
Peru, to it’s adoption in Europe and the rest of the world. It’s more
interesting than I would have expected.</p>

<p>He also makes a strong case for the potatoes health benefits.</p>

<p>The potato hack is basically eating nothing but boiled (not baked) potatoes
for four or five days. They can be salted and you can add vinegar or spices,
but no toppings. The blandness combined with the fairly high satiety factor of
boiled potatoes cause you to eat fewer calories than you normally would; thus
you lose weight. Eat normally for a few days and then repeat.</p>

<p>It’s a nice simple diet plan because it removes food variety and relies on a
very cheap food. But I wonder if upping the protein with whey powder or boiled
chicken breast or something would improve this (the <em>boiled chicken breast and
potato hack</em>?).</p>

<p>The section on resistant starch is very interesting. Raw potato starch
contains about 80% resistant starch and is sold in some grocery stores.
Resistant starch has many health benefits through its effect on healthy gut
bacteria.</p>

<h2 id="description">Description</h2>

<p>The potato hack was modeled after an 1849 diet plan for people that were
becoming fat and “dyspeptic” from living too luxuriously. This potato diet
simply called for one to eat nothing but potatoes for a few days at a time,
promising that fat men become as “lean as they ought to be.” One hundred and
sixty-seven years later, we are fatter and sicker than ever, but the potato
diet still works. Potatoes contains natural drug-like agents that affect
inflammation, hunger, insulin, sleep, dreams, mood, and body weight. The
potato is the best diet pill ever invented.</p>

<p>The potato hack is a short-term intervention (3-5 days) where one eats nothing
but potatoes. This short mono-food experiment will strengthen your immune
system and provide you with all of the nutrition you need to remain energetic,
sleep great, and, as a side-effect, lose weight. The potato hack will help you
develop a new relationship with food, hunger, taste, and yourself.</p>

<p>The potato hack is not just for the overweight. As noted in 1849, anyone with
digestive complaints who follows an all-potato diet for a few days at a time
will find their digestion improves greatly. Modern science shows that simple
diets high in fiber create an intestinal microbiome that is highly diverse and
stable. This diversity and stability is lacking in most people and leads to
digestive complaints like Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), Irritable
bowel syndrome (IBS), Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and Small intestinal
bacterial overgrowths (SIBO). The “modern dyspeptic gut” affects millions of
people and costs billions of dollars annually. The answer might be as simple
as 3-5 days of potatoes.</p>

<p>You don’t need this book to do the potato hack. Just eat potatoes until full
every day for 3-5 days. It really is that simple! This book explains the
science behind the potato hack, some variations on the basic hack, recipes,
and what to do if it does not work as advertised. Also found in The Potato
Hack is a comprehensive review of resistant starch, gut health, potato
history, and a growing guide for those that want to grow their own.</p>

<p>Most of the photography throughout the book was done by award-winning
photographer, Ann Overhulse. The artfully photographed potatoes found on the
cover and on 30 pages within are well worth the full price of the book.
Guaranteed that after reading The Potato Hack, you will never look at potatoes
the same.</p>

<h3 id="review">Review</h3>

<p>” <em>The general perception is that potatoes are meant to make you fat.That’s
why there are chances that people might not accept or believe on the concept
of this book, because it is difficult for people to digest the idea that one
could lose weight just by eating potatoes.However,for readers who like to
experiment unconventional genres, this book is a must read! **Tim Steele has
done thorough research in investigating the advantages of potatoes on human
health. Therefore, the book will be a great learning experience for people who
really want to shed those excess pounds and get in shape just in a couple of
days.*”<br />
-- ** Serious Reading</em>* book review, 1 August 2016</p>

<p>” <em>The Potato Hack is written with great humour, and considering it’s a whole
book about essentially just eating potatoes you’ll be surprised how
entertaining it is and how much you will learn. I am a bit of a geek when it
comes to nutrition so this book was right up my street!</em> “<br />
-- <strong>Chloe Archard, Paleo-Britain</strong> health Blog, 19 May 2016</p>

<p>” <em>I have only done two rounds of a 3-day potato hack (currently on round 3).
I lost 3 pounds on round #1 and 5 pounds on round #2. I regained a little bit
of weight after resuming with normal eating, but not as much as when I go low
carb. <strong>There seems to be less of a rebound effect with potatoes.</strong> I’ve kept
6 of the 8 pounds off…and feel I will hit my goal weight in just a few
weeks. My face and mid section are noticeably leaner. I really didn’t expect
that to happen so quickly.</em>”<br />
-- <strong>Rusty Moore from his Visual Impact Fitness blog,</strong> April 2016. Rusty
Moore is the owner of Visual Impact Fitness where he coaches runway models,
bodybuilders, and personal trainers.</p>

<p>” <em>While the potato hack is clearly no panacea, it was not designed to be.
Nearly every author that syndicates the potato hack recognizes that it should
be used as a 1-5 day reset for your digestive system. While it may not be the
best diet in the long run, it is pretty good at what it is designed for, short
term weight loss and improvements in the gut microbiome. I don’t have a
specific context you can use the potato hack in, but truthfully, you don’t
need one.</em> “<br />

microbiome that is highly diverse and stable. This diversity and stability is
lacking in most people and leads to digestive complaints like gastroesophageal
reflux disease, irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, and
small intestinal bacterial overgrowths.</em> “<br />
<strong>-- The Potato Grower’s Magazine</strong> , 28 March 2016</p>

<p>“T <em>his book is one of the most extensive investigations on the benefits of
resistant starch around. Tim covers a large body of research surrounding his
novel method of resetting the body against a whole host of ailments, from
chronic inflammation, insidious weight gain, and more. He lays out the
painstakingly detailed science behind the magic contained in one of our most
common staples, the potato, and the biological impact resistant starch can
have on the body. Definitely worth the read to get the most comprehensive
rundown on the topic.”</em><br />
<strong>-- Mark Sisson</strong> , author of <em>The Primal Blueprint</em> and publisher of
MarksDailyApple.com</p>

<p>” <em>Sometimes the simplest approach is the best one. The Potato Hack isn’t
fancy,complicated, or expensive, but it’s a powerful tool for weight loss.”</em><br />
<strong>-- Chris Kresser</strong> , Author of New York Times best seller <em>The Paleo Cure</em>.
Creator of top-ranked natural health website ChrisKresser.com. Co-director and
President of California Center for Functional Medicine</p>

<p><em>“The Potato Hack has revived the forgotten knowledge that a few days of
potato-only meals might just be the ticket to resetting a sticky metabolism,
losing weight, and restoring a healthy gut biome. Tim’s research over the past
couple years about resistant starch took the internet by storm. What was once
an esoteric term, “resistant starch” is now a household word, and Paleo
dieters are forever changed.Though I’m one of those genetically “gifted”
people mentioned in the book whose biology is not compatible with potatoes, if
you eat potatoes with impunity, the Potato Hack could be a great way to shake
up a diet that has stalled, or just to push your limits the way only a true
biohacker could appreciate. The Potato Hack breaks all the molds, just like
Bulletproof Coffee!”</em><br />
<strong>-- Dave Asprey</strong> , founder of Bulletproof and author of New York Times
bestseller <em>The Bulletproof Diet.</em></p>

<p><em>“Despite intermittent bad press from the media and some diet
communities,potatoes have long been a staple food for healthy populations
around the world, and humans have been eating tubers since Paleolithic times.
I would be hard pressed to find a better single food for a short-term period
of calorie restriction, which is sometimes called a ‘fast’ nowadays and is
showing promise for weight loss and improving health markers.The fact is, the
versatile potato is a nutrient dense wholefood, and that’s why it can also
play a prominent role in The Plant Paleo Diet that I created for long term
health, vitality, and longevity.”</em><br />
<strong>-- Angelo Coppola</strong> , host and producer of the Latest in Paleo Podcast and
The Plant Paleo Diet, PlantPaleo.com</p>

<p><em>Tim Steele proposed this “potato hack” as a means to rapid weight loss with
good nutrition and lack of hunger. What could be better? While I’m skeptical,
I always like a good self-experiment, so I put it out for others to try if
they like (search ‘potato hack’ for many posts and hundreds of comments).
Well, lots of people did try it and contrary to all sorts of ‘dire warnings’
from those who strictly advocate low-carb diets, most who tried it found lots
of success. It lived up to the hype.</em><br />

<h3 id="from-the-author">From the Author</h3>

<p><em>“Dieters know that it’s tough to lose more than a pound or two in a week.
Long term dieting success is dismal, with most people regaining the weight
they lost in a couple months. The Potato Hack: Weight Loss Simplified gives
you a stupendously easy tool to lose weight and to keep it off. Many find that
after they start eating better food choices, including potatoes, they never
need to worry about their weight again.This is not a “fad diet.” The potato
hack is a time-tested method for sustaining life an perfect health. If you are
overweight or have terrible digestive issues, give the potato hack a try.”</em><br />
