        <h1 id="dumb-things-students-do">Dumb things Students do</h1>

<p>I’ve taught chemistry to high-school students, so I’ve seen a <strong>lot</strong> of dumb shit; especially in the lower-level classes.</p>

<p>Those kids are so profoundly bad at answering simple questions in writing, that I resorted to giving them sentence templates just to make the grading bearable for myself… but also to help them understand what an answer should look like.</p>

<p>An answer template is basically the answer written out word-for-word for them, but they have to fill in some blanks. They look something like this:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Question: What time is it and where are you?

Answer: The time is ___ and I am in ___.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You’re probably wondering what kind of short-bus retard needs the template. <em>sigh</em></p>

<p>Yeah. That’s what I would have thought before I became a teacher.</p>

<p>I’ve actually seen kids insert numbers into blanks like that (where there should clearly be words). The laziness and stupidity are truly astounding.</p>

<p>Often kids are too lazy to write in the blanks.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">The time is ___ and I am in ___. 5:00pm, Hell</code></p>

<h2 id="people-cant-answer-multiple-part-questions">People Can’t Answer Multiple-Part Questions</h2>

<p>I don’t know what causes this. Maybe years of wishy-washy grading in English and Social Studies classes have conditioned kids to do this, but they treat questions as suggestions.</p>

<p>What I mean is that if you get a question that looks like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>List five causes of the Civil War, one shoe size, and the names of three television actors from the 1950s.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You’d be thinking to yourself, “OK, there are three things I have to do in the answer…”</p>

<ol>
  <li>List five causes of the Civil War</li>
  <li>Write down a shoe size</li>
  <li>Name three television actors from the 1950s</li>
</ol>

<p>And in your answer, you’d probably tackle all three requirements in that exact order. If you’re at all concerned about your grade, you’d make it clear which parts you are answering by writing something like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Five causes of the Civil War were…..</p>

  <p>A possible shoe size would be….</p>

  <p>Three television actors from the 1950s are…</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You get the picture.</p>

<p>But for so many of the kids I teach, the question seems to be a suggestion of what you <em>might</em> write about… if you were so inclined.</p>

<p>Answers to such a question could include any random assortment of facts or opinions about the Civil War, shoes, or television. Or the kid might answer only the first or last question and <strong>completely ignore</strong> all the others.</p>

<p>I actually noticed the <em>exact same</em> phenomenon with the kids in my teacher training classes. (I shifted careers later in life, so I wasn’t a total dumbshit… I mean, ‘spring chicken’ like most of the other students.)</p>

<h1 id="tech-support-exposes-how-dumb-people-are">Tech Support Exposes How Dumb People Are</h1>

<p>I used to do tech support.</p>

<p>There are so many examples of the idiotic things people say and do when they call tech support that there are entire websites devoted to them.</p>

<p>The general trends are that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>No-one reads error messages… or anything at all, really</li>
  <li>People have no idea how anything works</li>
  <li>People are blind to the obvious</li>
  <li>People give <strong>completely inaccurate</strong> descriptions to tech support</li>
  <li>And of course, customers blame everyone but themselves</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="no-one-reads-error-messages">No-One Reads Error Messages</h3>

<p>I’ve gotten this call many many times.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Customer: I tried to X and it gave me an error message</p>

  <p>Me: OK. Well, what did the error message say?</p>

  <p>Customer: …. Uh, I don’t know.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>WTF, people!?</p>

<p>Admittedly, part of the problem is that software designers have created some shitty error messages, but still…</p>

<h3 id="people-have-no-idea-how-anything-works">People Have No Idea How Anything Works</h3>

<p>Real call:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>C: My trackball doesn’t work.</p>

  <p>TS: Hmm… So what’s happening, the cursor doesn’t move, the buttons don’t work?</p>

  <p>C: Nothing works</p>

  <p>TS: OK, can you try clicking the right button and tell me what happens?</p>

  <p>C: There aren’t any buttons</p>

  <p>… more dialog …</p>

  <p>TS: That’s not a track-ball. You have your mouse upside down.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="people-are-blind-to-the-obvious">People are Blind to the Obvious</h3>

<p>This may be apocryphal, but I’ve read that people have called asking where certain keys are on their keyboard… number keys even.</p>

<p>People have also called about their computers not turning on… during a blackout.</p>

<h3 id="people-give-completely-inaccurate-descriptions">People give completely inaccurate descriptions</h3>

<p>Real call I’ve taken more than once:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>C: When I turn on my register, nothing happens.</p>

  <p>Me: OK, would you turn it on for me now?</p>

  <p>C: OK</p>

  <p>Me: Did the screen come on?</p>

  <p>C: Yes</p>

  <p>Me: Does it say something about checking memory?</p>

  <p>C: Yes</p>

  <p>Me: Does it say Windows is starting now?</p>

  <p>C: Yes</p>

  <p>Me: OK, is the desktop on the screen now?</p>

  <p>C: Yes</p>

  <p>Me: Alright, and is the register program starting?</p>

  <p>C: No</p>

  <p>Me: Hmm… So the register turned on, the screen came on, the computer booted, Windows loaded, and the desktop showed up… That doesn’t sound like <em>nothing</em> to me…</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="special-mention-kids-dont-have-a-theory-of-mind">Special Mention: Kids Don’t Have a Theory of Mind</h3>

<p>Here’s a special problem when I get tech-related requests from kids.</p>

<p>They’ll give me absolutely no context, and then expect me to know what the fuck they’re talking about!</p>

<p>Like, I’ll get an email out of the blue from some kid who’ll say something like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It didn’t work when I clicked on it in the test.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>OK, fuck-tard. Which test!? And what’s ‘it’!?</p>

<p>I’m not in your head, you idiot! You can’t just start off talking about ‘<em>it</em>’ and expect me to know what the fuck you’re talking about!</p>

<p><em>sigh</em></p>

<h4 id="theory-of-mind">Theory of Mind</h4>

<p>In psychology, the relevant phenomenon is called ‘theory of mind’. It’s the idea that other people have a mind just like you do, and therefore, what’s in their mind is different from what’s in yours.</p>

<p>Kids suck at this.</p>

<p>This <em>theory of mind</em> develops as children grow and become less of a colossal dumb-shit. But it takes a long time to mature.</p>

<p>A classic experiment was to show kids a cartoon of two kids in a room. The kids both see that an adult comes in a puts a cookie in a box. Then kid A leaves the room and kid B puts the cookie in a cupboard. Kid A comes back, and the experimenter asks the child, “Where will Kid A look for the cookie?”.</p>

<p>Young kids will say that Kid A looks for the cookie in the cupboard, because <em>they</em> know that that’s where the cookie is, and therefore everyone must know where the cookie is. They don’t understand how minds work.</p>

<p>Older kids understand that Kid A still thinks that the cookie is in the box because he has a mind of his own and <em>he did not see the other kid move the cookie</em>.</p>

<p>This is a pretty drastic example, but according to E.D. Hirsch Jr. (in I book I can’t be bothered to look up), kids continue to suck at this sort of thing for much longer than you’d think.</p>

<p>Scientists have done tests where people have to describe unusual things to others. To do this well, you have to have a reasonable idea of what the other person can be expected to know, and what they can’t be expected to know. You have to have a really good grasp what the other person can’t possibly know (because they aren’t frickin mind-readers).</p>

<p>Adults do very well on these tests, but children suck to an astounding degree… even up to the teens.</p>
