        <p>I’m thinking about possibly starting a project to share electronic versions of books (kindle, mobi, epub, pdf) along with community-generated flashcards for Anki.</p>

<p>The major features I’m after with the project would be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Freely shared electronic versions of great (not good) non-fiction books curated by like-minded group members</li>
  <li>Well-made Anki flashcards cooperatively created by group-members based on the books</li>
</ul>

<p>I guess that’s pretty much it. Just two major features.</p>

<h2 id="how-this-project-is-unique">How this project is unique</h2>

<p>As far as I know, there isn’t anything else like this out there.</p>

<p>There are some <strong>fantastic</strong> resources for finding free ebooks such as <a href="http://gen.lib.rus.ec">Library Genesis</a> (and it’s <a href="http://bookzz.org">bookzz.or</a> mirror), book-sharing sites on TOR and I2P, and numerous shared Calibre libraries on TOR and I2P. But these great resources lack 2 things:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Curated Books</li>
  <li>Flashcards</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="curated-books">Curated Books</h3>

<p>If you’re just learning about a subject, you don’t have the experience needed to put together a great reading list. It helps to have someone who’s been in your shoes tell you what books are the best and in what order you should read them.</p>

<p>There are some great curated lists out there on Amazon and Goodreads, but these lists are just that; lists. They don’t provide download links for the books, and they certainly don’t provide well-made flashcards based on them.</p>

<h3 id="well-made-flashcards">Well-Made Flashcards</h3>

<p>Reading a book and understanding its contents doesn’t lead to remembering. In the words of Joshua Foer (<em>Moonwalking with Einstein</em>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If the point of reading were simply to retain knowledge, it would probably be the single least efficient activity I engage in.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There was a time when people read <em>intensively</em>; they read a few books and they committed much of those books to memory. Now, even our teachers (who should know better) focus almost exclusively on comprehension at the cost of memorization.</p>

<p>Clearly, the two should go hand-in-hand. Neglecting memory seriously impedes our ability to learn. It’s been well established by cognitive scientist that the more you know, the more you <em>can</em> know; the easier and faster you can pick up new, related material.</p>

<p>So by not memorizing the key points of what you’re reading now, you make it harder to learn new material in the future.</p>

<p>And as has been well-established by E.D. Hirsch Jr. and others, comprehension itself relies on having relevant facts already memorized. So by not memorizing now, you actually make it harder to <em>understand</em> what you read later (including later <em>in the same book</em>!).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One book, printed in the heart’s own wax, is worth a thousand in the stacks. – Jan Luyken</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The testing effect of flashcards is the most effective practical way of retaining knowledge, and using a spaced repetition algorithm is the most efficient way to retain knowledge over time.</p>

<p>In my opinion, Anki is the best spaced-repetition flashcard program out there, so that’s the platform of choice for flashcards.</p>

<h3 id="the-problem">The Problem</h3>

<p>OK, so first of all, this project would solve the problem of finding a well-curated list of great non-fiction books. Second, it would solve the problem of actually getting your hands on the books. But most of all, it would solve the problem of finding decent flashcards based on those books.</p>

<p>Yes, there are a lot of shared flashcard decks, but:</p>

<ol>
  <li>They usually aren’t for a mass-market non-fiction book, and</li>
  <li>They usually <strong>suck ass!</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>Most people don’t bother to create flashcards for the non-fiction books they read, and the ones that do tend to really suck at it! For those reasons, you normally have to do this yourself.</p>

<p>Making your own flashcards is probably the better choice, because there’s a benefit to collecting, filtering, and re-phrasing what you read in order to turn it into a good set of flashcards, but this is time-consuming work. It’s probably more <em>efficient</em> to grab a set of well-made flashcards and <em>cover twice the material in the same amount of time</em> rather than to make your own and cover only half as much.</p>

<p>Also, if you’re one of the majority of people who suck at making flashcards, then it wouldn’t hurt to see examples of well-made flashcards. It should help you learn how to make your own.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Creating some training for how to make decent flashcards is a good idea, but limiting cards to cloze-deletions and a decent template will go a long way.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="users-work-flow">User’s work-flow</h2>

<p>So the way the project would fit in to your actual life would be as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Peruse the reading lists on the project site, find a book that interests you and download it.</li>
  <li>Download the accompanying kindle highlights and Anki flashcards and install.</li>
  <li>Read the book, and start working through the flashcards.</li>
  <li>If you see key points not highlighted, highlight them yourself. Then use a script to turn your new highlights into flashcards.</li>
  <li>If you find errors or poor wording in the flashcards, edit them yourself.</li>
  <li>Use CrowdAnki and git to create a pull request to incorporate your flashcard changes to the main repository.</li>
</ol>

<p>You benefit by being able to <em>borrow</em> a copy of the book, and by getting pre-made flashcards. Others in turn, benefit from the flashcards and flashcard improvements that you make.</p>

<h2 id="a-possible-name">A Possible Name?</h2>

<p>I’m leaning towards naming this project after Benjamin Franklin, the American polymath who started the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junto_(club)">Junto</a>, a club for mutual improvement in 1727. The club involved a lending library consisting of the member’s own books.</p>

<p><em>Junto</em>, is sort of an ugly, obscure word. It doesn’t express what this project is about. But something like <em>The Franklin Book Society</em> would work.</p>

<h2 id="whats-needed">What’s Needed</h2>

<h3 id="kindle-to-anki">Kindle to Anki</h3>

<p>As I see it, we need a good script to pull highlights from the kindle, and convert them into cloze-deletion cards for Anki.</p>

<p>I already have a script that does that, but I’ll probably re-write it to be more robust. Maybe I’ll have it import the highlights into an SQLite database first.</p>

<p>Ideally, it would be nice to import shared highlights to your kindle, so as you’re reading a book, you know what’s already been highlighted (and turned into a flashcard), and what hasn’t.</p>

<h3 id="a-kick-ass-template-for-anki-notes">A kick-ass template for Anki notes</h3>

<p>Again, I’ve got one that I created for kindle highlights already… should be pretty much good-to-go, but a tutorial on how to use it would be nice.</p>

<h3 id="collaborative-flashcard-platform">Collaborative flashcard platform</h3>

<p>There’s an addon for Anki called <a href="https://github.com/Stvad/CrowdAnki">CrowdAnki</a> that would make this possible. Sharing, syncing, and version controlling would then be handled by git.</p>

<p>Of course, if we’re going to be sharing copywrited books, i2p would be a good network to use. I believe that there’s a git server on i2p somewhere (found it: <a href="http://git.repo.i2p">git.repo.i2p</a>.</p>

<h3 id="members">Members</h3>

<p>Yeah, this is the tough part. I’d need to somehow attract:</p>

<ul>
  <li>People who give a shit about learning</li>
  <li>People who use or would use Anki</li>
  <li>People tech-savvy enough to use git</li>
  <li>People on i2p</li>
</ul>

<p>Each of those narrows down the list of possible people quite a bit; especially that last one. Oh well. Maybe cut out sharing the books. That way the project could be out there in the open instead of on i2p.</p>
