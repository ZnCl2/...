      <article role="main" class="blog-post">
        <p>It’s good to have a basic level of fighting skills. That will help prevent other people from taking advantage of you. The problem is that our culture doesn’t promote this; at least not in the USA. We don’t learn basic fighting skills in school. If you’re a beginner in pretty much any area, it’s hard to know where to start and self defense is no exception.</p>

<h2 id="in-a-nutshell">In a nutshell</h2>

<p>Start with a course geared towards basic self defense strategies such as the Gracie Combatives course. It was designed to teach you the 36 most commonly used, most useful moves from Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. This will give you a good foundation to start with.</p>

<p>Other good options would be Krav Maga, or anything specifically designed for self defense. You want to find a program with an organized curriculum; not a class with different stuff every week.</p>

<p>Above all, stay away from ‘sports’ classes if you can. This would be most of the BJJ classes out there, which are geared towards competition; not actual street fights.</p>

<h2 id="gracie-combatives">Gracie Combatives</h2>

<p>This curriculum was created by studying the fights of Gracie family members (a Brazilian Jiu Jitsu dynasty) and distilling the 36 most used and most successful techniques from the 600+ techniques of BJJ.</p>

<p>It’s a good basic curriculum mostly in ground-work and submission holds (wrestling on the ground), which is where BJJ shines. You do learn standing techniques, but many of them involve getting an opponent on the ground; which they say is where most fights end up.</p>

<p>What’s lacking entirely is striking techniques. You just don’t do that in BJJ. While it means you can be gentle towards an opponent, this comes at the price of efficiency; it’s probably more efficient at times to hit someone.</p>

<p>What’s really nice about this program is that they’ve done the filtering for you. You focus on the 36 techniques and only on the 36 techniques. Classes generally cycle through them each week, so you’ll learn a new technique, but review a couple old ones each time. This gives you a manageable chunk to work with and master.</p>

<p>The course is designed to teach you to defend yourself against an opponent who doesn’t have training in BJJ; not to compete in sports events against other BJJ fighters.</p>

<p>There’s an online Gracie University where you can get videos of the techniques for the combatives classes and some of the higher-level classes. It’s theoretically possible to learn the techniques just through videos and practicing on your own, but I think that would be very hard to do. It’s better to find a class in my opinion; then use the videos to refresh yourself on proper technique.</p>

<h2 id="krav-maga">Krav Maga</h2>

<p>Krav Maga is the martial art of the Iraeli military. It’s fairly modern, and doesn’t have any sort of sports competition component at all. That’s a good thing because it means Krav Maga classes are more likely to be dedicated to actual fighting; not sports competitions.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The reason to stay away from the ‘sports’ martial arts (such as boxing and Tae Kwon Do) is that they’ve evolved to work under a set of civilized rules. For example, boxers don’t kick or grab or hit below the belt; that sort of thing. All of these fighting sports have a lot to offer, but they expect civil behavior from your opponent. You can’t rely on this is a street fight.</p>

  <p>Also, these sports techniques tend to be things that work well in the ring. In a real life-or-death fight, adrenaline gives you added strength but takes away coordination. Unless you’re an experienced fighter (which I hope you aren’t), this will make fancy Steven-Segal-style techniques very difficult.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Krav Maga will give you the striking techniques lacking in BJJ, but it pairs well with groundwork.</p>

<p>Watch out for ‘fitness’ courses. Some people take martial arts courses as a way of working out, and the people who teach them naturally cater to that. After all, catering to public demand is how they earn a living. Krav Maga courses usually have a fitness component to them, but you want to find one that focuses mostly on fighting.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Notable benefit of Krav Maga: No bullshit <em>spiritual</em> or cultural baggage. They don’t pretend that fighting is part of some quasi-religious practice like some of the older Asian martial arts do; just straight-forward efficient fighting technique.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>If you can only do one of the two above, I’d say go for Krav Maga. While Gracie Combatives is a great foundation in ground work, Krav Maga will provide some of that and more training in standing and striking work.</p>
