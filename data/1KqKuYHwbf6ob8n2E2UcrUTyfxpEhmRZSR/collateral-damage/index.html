    <h1>Collateral Damage: Incoming Regulation That Might Kill the Decentralized Web</h1>

    
      <img class="banner-image render-pixel" src="../media/Red_laptop_with_reflection__KfZZdxt.banner_d.jpg" />
    

    <div class="page-body-contents">
      <p>There&#39;s a new impetus among governments to combat the centralized web with laws and regulations. But could these proposals also affect decentralized alternatives? We&#39;ll talk about concrete new laws from GDPR to Article 13, incoming drafts, and big picture initiatives, and how they might be tweaked to help, not hinder, the Dweb.</p>

<p>How can developers either comply with those rules or design their systems in line with the underlying goals of protecting privacy and giving users control over their data?<br />
&nbsp;<br />
This workshop provides an opportunity for developers who care about the privacy goals underlying the GDPR and other regulations to learn from legal experts, to share information about their systems and how they view compliance, and to hear from builders who are implementing systems under these legal regimes.</p>

          <div><p>Danny O'Brien has been an activist for online free speech and privacy for over 20 years. In his home country of the UK, he fought against repressive anti-encryption law, and helped make the UK Parliament more transparent with FaxYourMP.&nbsp; He was EFF's activist from 2005 to 2007, and its international outreach coordinator from 2007-2009.

          <div class="modal-subtitle">Technical Lead, Matrix</div>
          <div><p>Matthew Hodgson is technical co-founder of Matrix.org: a not-for-profit open source project focused on solving the problem of fragmentation in current Chat, VoIP and IoT technologies. By defining a new lightweight pragmatic open standard for federation/interoperability and releasing open source reference implementations, Matrix hopes to create a new ecosystem that makes open real-time-communication as universal and interoperable as email.</p>

<p>Matthew juggles Matrix with the roles of CEO and CTO of New Vector, the company behind Riot.im, the flagship collaboration app built on Matrix. Previously, as a technical lead at MX Telecom (acquired by Amdocs in 2010), Matthew designed &amp; architected Amdocs&rsquo; next-generation Video/VoIP client and network infrastructure, and draws on his Internet background to rapidly deliver carrier-grade enhanced communication solutions to network operators. He has specialised in interactive video and telephony applications for over 16 years, including co-founding a digital marketing startup, and contracting roles at Accenture and the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory. He has a BA in Computer Science and Physics from the University of Cambridge, and has lectured on VoIP at Imperial College London.</p>

<p>Matthew believes in the virtues of open collaboration. We live in an era where we can benefit very easily from cross-industry inputs to foster innovation and we don&#39;t make enough out of it. He wants to change the world to give access to communication and privacy to everyone while keeping the user&#39;s experience at the heart of every new product and leaving everyone the choice of their provider.</p></div>
