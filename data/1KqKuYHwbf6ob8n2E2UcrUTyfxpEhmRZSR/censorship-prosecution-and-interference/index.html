    <div class="page-body-contents">
      <p>This panel provides an overview of the ways we have seen, are currently seeing, and are likely to see, misguided and/or malicious government interference that restricts the free flow of information online. It will also ask how those governments are likely to deal with the Decentralized Web, and how Decentralized Web developers can build tools that may counter governments that fail to respect their users&rsquo; rights. What are the legal frameworks that limit and protect these new technologies?<br />
