      <p>Take a deeper dive into decentralized projects, protocols, and products at our <strong>Science Fair</strong>&mdash;held during the Opening Night Party at the Internet Archive, Tuesday, July 31 from 6-9 p.m. From the Great Room to the lawn, you will find 70 tables + 70 projects = countless innovative ideas.</p>

<p>Science Fair is a time for you to talk one-on-one with the builders of the Decentralized Web, ask questions, and try out the latest&nbsp;working code. Then, once&nbsp;you know the names, faces and projects, you&#39;ll be better set to chart your course through the Summit offerings the next day.</p>

<p>Who knows, you might just meet your next partner, employer, staffer or best friend in the process!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <div class="science-fair-short-description">Althea empowers individuals and communities to build and maintain their own sustainable, decentralized internet infrastructure.</div>
          <div><p><strong>Althea empowers individuals and communities to build and maintain their own sustainable, decentralized internet infrastructure. This is a benefit not only to those who need better access to the internet, but to everyone who believes in the freedom of content and choice of internet providers. Althea networks will also be more efficient, since each node in an Althea network competes with its neighbors to provide the cheapest, fastest service.</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Althea works at a low level by allowing internet routers to pay each other for bandwidth. This can be used to create a city-wide incentivized mesh network. End users load their home routers with cryptocurrency, then pay into the mesh as they use bandwidth. Routers in the network automatically compete to provide the cheapest and best service. The permissionless nature of this network disrupts the top-down monopolistic ownership model of today&#39;s ISPs. Prices can vary widely between networks, and with a given user&#39;s data usage, but we expect that they will be about half of what existing ISPs charge due to competition within the network.</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Althea subnet DAOs are on-blockchain organizations which maintain the list of routers (identified by IP address) that make up a local mesh network. They are run by &quot;subnet organizers&quot; who add routers to this list, and can remove bad actors from the network. Subnet DAOs can also charge each router on the network a continous flat fee. Depending on the subnet DAO, the organizers may provide services usually provided by an ISP, such as installation and customer service. Subnet DAOs are very adaptable and we expect a variety of governance approaches, from consensus based collective decision making to more traditional business like approaches.</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>How will mainstream end users know which subnet DAO to join? Subnet DAOs will be curated by a the Althea global TCR, a tokenized voting system. Through votes, the global TCR generates a list of known-good subnet DAOs. Subnet DAOs can additional put down a deposit to secure their spot on the list. People interested in getting on the Althea network can simply check a website, and input their address to find the subnet DAO in their area which best meets their preferences for level of service and price. An important distinction between subnet DAOs and traditional ISPs is that one router can be part of multiple subnet DAOs. This unpacks the role of the ISP, and removes the traditional monopoly over physical equipment.</strong></p></div>

          <div><h1><strong>How it works</strong></h1>

<p>Beaker adds support for a peer-to-peer protocol called Dat. It&#39;s the Web you know and love, but instead of HTTP, websites and files are transported with Dat.</p>

<p>Deploy a website from your computer &mdash; no server required! Visitors connect directly to each other, sharing your site&#39;s files and helping keep it online.</p>

<p>Files are transported with the peer-to-peer network instead of being locked away on a server, so you can explore all the files that make up a website or app.</p>

<h1>&nbsp;</h1>

<h1><strong>Why build a browser?</strong></h1>

<h1>&nbsp;</h1>

<p>Browsers are the gateway to the Web! By building a browser with experimental features and capabilities, we have the flexibility to explore how the browser can help uphold the vision of an open Web.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h1><strong>History</strong></h1>

<h1>&nbsp;</h1>

<p>Paul released the Beaker prototype in August 2016 after participating in the inaugural Decentralized Web Summit, where he shopped his idea to integrate peer-to-peer protocols into a browser.</p>

<p>Tara made her first contribution in October 2016 and joined full-time in April 2017. As core developer of the Dat protocol, Mathias has always been a part of the Beaker community, but he officially joined the Beaker team in 2018.</p></div>

        <div class="modal-bio">
          <div class="science-fair-short-description">The Bitcoin Reference DID method supports DIDs on the public Bitcoin blockchain</div>
          <div><p><strong>The Bitcoin Reference DID method (did:btcr) supports DIDs on the public Bitcoin blockchain. The Bitcoin Reference method has minimal design goals: a DID trust anchor based on the Bitcoin blockchain, updates publicly visible and auditable via Bitcoin transactions, and optionally, additional DID Document information referenced in the transaction OP_RETURN data field. No other Personal Identifiable Information (PII) would be placed on the immutable blockchain.</strong></p>

<p><strong>A secondary intent of the BTCR method is to serve as a very conservative, very secure example and some best practices for creating a DID method. The use cases for BTCR are focused on anonymous and pseudo-anonymous identities, web-of-trust style webs of identity, and absolute mimimal personal information disclosure. Other DID methods will likely need to loosen these standards.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Some aspects of the BTCR method will not be practical if inappropriately scaled &mdash; for instance, there is a transaction cost to update keys and DDO object, potential UTXO inflation (i.e. one additional unspent output for every BTCR-based identity), and even if segwit isn&#39;t used it could cause blockchain bloat. However, identities using the BTCR method can be a strong as Bitcoin itself -- currently securing billions of dollars of digital value.</strong></p></div>

          <div class="science-fair-short-description">bunsanweb is a decentralized web born in Tokyo which forms an open network of individual programs that freely share information between them.</div>
          <div><p><strong>bunsanweb is a decentralized web born in Tokyo which forms an open network of individual programs that freely share information between them. Its foundation is built on standard browser-side web technologies.</strong></p>

<p><strong>We view the web as a network of user agents (i.e. browsers) and hyperlinked resources, not a network of servers for their clients. We want the web to be a web of something where user agents communicate with document resources. Hyperlinks can directly link resources across web servers. &nbsp;However, in the status quo the web has become centralized and has become reliant on opaque web services that act as intermediaries between people and resources.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Our goal has been to create a decentralized web that takes back control from these monopolistic systems. We want to create an environment where browsers are enhanced with decentralizing features and programming functionalities are provided for decentralized architectures. We want to return the web to one that emphasizes end-to-end principles and reduce, if not eliminate, centralizing intermediary factors from endpoints. We believe that web endpoints should become an endpoint of inter-person systems. In this system the browser itself can become a resource and perform endpoint-scripts for system functions broken in a decentralized manner.</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>bunsanweb attempts to provide the tools necessary to realize these goals. Namely, Endpoint-scripting for mixing server-side scripting features into the client-side &nbsp;which allows for both accessing and producing Web resources.</strong></p>

<p><strong>A universal event stream for communicating with unspecified endpoint scripts without the need for specific centralized channels.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Endpoint-relative hyperlinked space where each endpoint views resources from each local link to the universal web. e.g. Where &quot;personal data&quot; is a relative resource for each person that may link to &quot;friends&quot; on the universal web.</strong></p>

<p><strong>We have created prototypes of these tools and more information and code can be found on our website and github repos.</strong></p>

          <div class="science-fair-short-description">Refactoring the Web Economy through the Interledger Protocol</div>
          <div><p><strong>Web monetization and refactoring the Web Economy</strong></p>

<p><strong>The Internet&rsquo;s &lsquo;original sin&rsquo;, as coined by Ethan Zuckerman, describes the current problem that there is no obvious way to monetize the web without workarounds such as advertisement, data selling or obtrusive paywalls. As a result we are starting to see the consequences of these models - ranging from Facebook&rsquo;s Cambridge Analytica scandal to ad-blocker/ad-blocker-blocker wars between publishers. </strong></p>

<p><strong>Micropayments has often been discussed as a potential model to support content-creators and others such as Netflix have created subscription services that bundle content. However since these are often closed systems, they have often failed to capture the majority of content on the web, particularly for small-medium sized creators.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Coil uses the Interledger protocol to provide a third option outside of the aforementioned payment options. Through a flat rate subscription, Coil will be the first company to use Web Monetization (a new standard for how browsers can pay websites using Interledger) to pay out to websites in whatever currency they choose. </strong></p>

<p><strong>Web Monetization is a proposed browser API that uses ILP micropayments to monetize a site. It can be polyfilled by extensions, or can be implemented directly into an ILP-enabled browser. It is designed for continuous payments and to have minimal user interaction. As a result , we imagine that a variety of content can be paid for, ranging from static sites to video streaming.</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Coil can essentially be fighting against the monopolization of the Web and kickstart a more diverse, healthier Internet.</strong></p></div>

          <div><p>The DID Universal Resolver is first major project of the 30+ members of the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF). DIDs (Decentralized Identifiers) are a foundational standard for decentralized, blockchain-based identity. A DID method is a spec that defines how DIDs are created, read, updated, and deleted (revoked) on a specific blockchain or distributed system. DID methods have been implemented for Bitcoin, Ethereum, Sovrin, IPFS, Veres One, and Blockstack. The Universal Resolver uses Docker-based modules to plug different DID methods into a single codebase. This session will cover the W3C DID specification, the architecture of the Universal Resolver, the primary features of different DID methods, and where the Universal Resolver fits in the fast-moving decentralized identity ecosystem.</p></div>

to defend their rights.</div>
          <div><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Digital Democracy&rsquo;s mission is to empower marginalized communities to<br />
use technology to defend their rights. As technology becomes cheaper<br />
and more accessible, we believe it can and should be used to bring<br />
more voices to the table. Digital Democracy helps our partners achieve<br />
transformative change and works toward a world where all people can<br />
participate in decisions that govern their lives.<br />
<br />
Over the past eight years, we&rsquo;ve seen firsthand that change does not<br />
come from technology, but from how people use it. Our local partners<br />
represent marginalized communities around the globe. We have worked<br />
with communities from Haiti to Burma to Peru. Working at the<br />
intersection of human rights and technology, Dd supports local leaders<br />
with the strategic use of tools to catalyze community-driven<br />
solutions.<br />
<br />
Our process is both technology and issue agnostic &ndash; that is, not bound<br />
to one platform or cause. We recognize that our partners&rsquo; issues are<br />
diverse, but many of the challenges they face are shared. Using a<br />
listening-based, human-centered design process, Dd helps to strengthen<br />
our partners&rsquo; access, communication, resources and reach.<br />
<br />
Equipped with the tools they need, our partners become better<br />
storytellers, advocates and leaders. Together, Dd and its partners are<br />
empowering communities to become their own voice for change. Digital<br />
Democracy works in three primary ways:<br />
<br />
Direct Implementation: We train communities to use basic digital<br />
tools, such as cameras, mobile phones, maps and data collection tools.<br />
We conduct ongoing support and capacity building for our partners<br />
whose projects are designed to defend their human &amp; environmental<br />
rights.<br />
<br />
Tool Building: We co-create tech solutions with our partners and help<br />
them adapt existing tools to their needs. We also collaborate with<br />
other technologists to support the greater eco-system of open-source<br />
tools which can support our partners&rsquo; needs.<br />
<br />
Local-to-Global Engagement: We scale our impact beyond our direct<br />
partners. Through events, workshops, and tool-kits, we build bridges<br />
between our work and the work of advocates and decision-makers around<br />
the world.</p></div>

<p><strong>Browser extensions with libdweb</strong></p>

<p><strong>You&#39;ve built a distributed application platform that will change everything... but where is everyone? Browser extensions can lower the barrier to entry for early-adopters and developers to try your project.</strong></p>

<p><strong>We&rsquo;re developing a set of experimental APIs for building dweb applications using the WebExtension framework in Firefox - protocol handlers, TCP/UDP sockets, filesystem access and more.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Come by to see demos and talk to us about what you need to build dweb apps in browsers.</strong></p>

          <div><p><strong>At Gnosis, we believe in a redistributed future. A future where anyone can create and trade any kind of asset, allowing for a more efficient distribution of resources.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Before cryptocurrencies came to life, most trading and trans-national business were made with one dominant currency, f.ex. USD on the NASDAQ. With blockchain technology and the application of crypto-economics, plenty of tokens could potentially be considered a base currency, with none of them being strongly predominant. This scenario calls for cross-currency liquidity and markets that can encompass multiple token-economies.</strong></p>

<p><strong>We are building market mechanisms that provide maximum liquidity in such a setting, and allow for arbitrage-free trading across all tokens. Through our decentralized platforms, we enable the distribution of resources&mdash;whether these are assets, incentives, information, or ideas. We thus make a redistributed future possible.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Our products are interoperable, allowing you to create, trade, and hold assets.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Create assets Our prediction market platforms allows anyone to build customized forecasting applications, and thus to create an entirely new kind of asset: outcome tokens, which make trading the outcome of any event possible, and hence surface relevant information.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Trade assets Our decentralized exchange models will enable arbitrage-free trading for these new kinds of assets (outcome tokens), or for any other asset, any information, incentive, or idea.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Hold assets Additionally, our Gnosis Safe wallet aims to set a standard for secure, user-controlled fund storage. The Gnosis Safe allows people to securely hold assets, and facilitates onboarding new users to our decentralized platforms by making it as easy as possible to interact with decentralized applications.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Our decentralized platforms and applications provide foundational infrastructure, assuring security, stability, and foresight for the longevity of blockchain-driven technologies.</strong></p>

          <div><p>GUN is an open-source decentralized database service that allows developers to build fast peer-to-peer applications that will work, even when their users are offline. It has raised over $1.5 million in a seed round led by Draper Associates. Other investors include Salesforce&rsquo;s Marc Benioff through Aloha Angels, as well as Boost VC, CRCM and other angel investors.</p>

<p>The project originated 4 years ago, mostly because the founder saw the database behind his early projects as a single point of failure. The idea behind GUN is to offer a decentralized database system that offers real-time updates with eventual consistency.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One can use GUN to build a peer-to-peer database or opt for a multi-master setup. In this scheme, a cloud-based server simply becomes another peer in the network. GUN users get tools for conflict resolution and other core features out of the box and the data is automatically distributed between peers. When users go offline, data is cached locally and then merged back into this database once they come online.</p>

<p>Today, the system has been used to build a decentralized version of Reddit that can handle a few million uniques per month and a similarly decentralized YouTube clone.&nbsp;</p></div>

          <div><p><strong>Standards for a Self-Sovereign Technology Stack</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Trustee.AI innovates in two aspects of personal data management: decentralized governance and a standards-based self-sovereign technology stack, using blockchain-based decentralized identifiers (DID), W3C Verifiable Credentials, and User Managed Access (UMA) authorization standards. Decentralized governance and self-sovereign technology are linked because in the case where the underlying infrastructure is fully standardized, the only grounds for competition or differentiation are in governance structure and policies. . These concepts stand in contrast to first-generation personal information management that is typically not standards-based and is governed by a central authority.. </strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Health records will be our first &nbsp;use-case as an alternative to current governance practice of how data is used and monetized by state (typical in EU), hospital (typical in US), or vendor (e.g. Google or IQVIA) oligopolies. Trustee.AI represents a fourth alternative with technology as fiduciary to each patient. Our initial proof-of-concept is a health record for the homeless in collaboration with Atlanta&rsquo;s Emory Healthcare Network. The patients will have full control over access policies for records that include allergies, current medications, diagnoses, encounter notes, labs, imaging, insurance status, emergency contacts, and provider lists. Public blockchains help manage access credentials and accountability independent of any particular institution.</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Expected audience: The talk will not be particularly technical. It will show our reference implementation of UMA, uPort, and FHIR health records in a context familiar to anyone who has had some medical encounters. The talk will address challenges in governance for self-sovereign technologies and personal data management, and these topics are relevant in many domains, not just healthcare..</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Notes: Adrian Gropper, MD is the main presenter. As a long-time participant in Rebooting Web of Trust, W3C, and UMA standards. All of the Trustee.AI code is open source on GitHub. </strong></p>

          <div><p><strong>﻿Advancing composability in P2P software utilizing DHT solutions to build an agent-centric internet.</strong></p>

<p><strong>A demo and open discussion on how agent-centric models in P2P applications can lead to greater composability, and how reinventing &quot;old&quot; technologies can unleash new transformative shifts in social coordination, economic outcomes, and realizing shared visions on a global scale.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Jean Russell and Sami Van Ness of Holo/Holochain will host small rolling demos of DHT-based P2P software solutions, and then open the floor for small person-to-person physical exercises which will replicate the functions of a DHT using real-life social coordination. </strong></p>

<p><strong>From there Jean will host lightingtalk-style discussions on using P2P agent-centric applications to layer innovations into &ldquo;social plugins&rdquo; which enable new emerging ways of sharing resources, unleashing new forms of wealth, and distributing data, goods and services without centralized middlemen. </strong></p>

<p><strong>In parallel Sami will host more technical lightningtalk-style discussions on using P2P agent-centric applications to layer innovations into software modules utilizing WebAssmembly, Rust, and the Unity Engine to transform what we think of as &ldquo;browser plugins&rdquo; or &ldquo;applications&rdquo;, and even how we think of modeling traditional business software like calendars when the restrictions of 2D are removed. </strong></p>

<p><br />
<strong>About us:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Jean Russell and Sami Van Ness both work for Holo, a distributed cloud hosting platform built on Holochain, which rewards users in cryptocurrency for giving up part of their devices&rsquo; spare resources to host distributed applications. Holochain is an Open-source DHT-based blockchain alternative and, infrastructure technology for distributed peer-to-peer applications, and Holo is the flagship application to be built on top of it. The purpose of Holo is to act as a bridge between the budding community of distributed Holochain apps, and the current centralized web. By creating an ecosystem and currency that enable distributed hosting services provided by peers, Holo brings access to distributed applications to the familiar web browser. </strong></p>

<p><strong>Although we are both representing the company while here, this talk requires no knowledge of our products or services, and is aimed at a more general audience from technical to non-technical. The concepts that make up our platform are not new, they are recompositions of existing technologies, and that composability is actually the core of our talk.</strong></p></div>

<p><strong>A Distributed and Persistent Archival Replay System Using IPFS</strong></p>

<p><strong>InterPlanetary Wayback (IPWB) facilitates permanence and collaboration in web archives by disseminating the contents of WARC files into the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) network. IPFS is a peer-to-peer content-addressable file system that inherently allows deduplication and facilitates opt-in replication. IPWB splits the header and payload of WARC response records before disseminating into IPFS to leverage the deduplication, builds a CDXJ index with references to the IPFS hashes returns, and combines the header and payload from IPFS at the time of replay.</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Qs-NEEesg7uhIPfzCk05UN_4kDaYvdKdr-JFQyBOC1_A04OHdhNzEyfGHKEpUKUcGcLA-HwInZC0kokTnpTFKvu_Au4Yi08mB5Ki6ZMNtG-FPbWuJdQz7d8E3sUBK-8eHNheFrFgbwja0VvXLQ" style="height:265px; width:512px" /></strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The figure above illustrates the indexing and replay process. The indexer extracts records from the WARC store one record at a time, splits each record into HTTP header and payload, stores the two pieces into IPFS, and generates a CDXJ record using the returned references and some other metadata from the WARC record. The replay receives request from users containing a lookup URI and optionally a datetime, queries for matching record in the CDXJ, fetches the corresponding header and payload from the IPFS Store (using references returned from the index record), combines them, and performs necessary transformation to build the response to the user.

          <div class="science-fair-short-description">Using Web3 standards and blockchain to issue digital assets representing social impact to fulfill the Sustainable Development Goals</div>
          <div><p><strong>Introducing ixo: The Blockchain for Impact</strong></p>

<p><strong>Problem space:</strong></p>

<p><strong>We want to fundamentally address a) the dearth of high quality data measuring impact, and b) the consequent high costs and low liquidity of impact investing and results-based finance instruments.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The ixo solution </strong></p>

<p><strong>We enable any project to cost-effectively collect, verify and measure its impact, enabling funding to be linked to Proof of Impact. We provide a shared data layer and audit trail that documents claims about service delivery and outcomes. Verified impact data is tokenized as digital assets called Impact Tokens, which represent proof of achievement of a project-defined impact metric, milestone or outcome. </strong></p>

<p><strong>Impact Tokens can be traded and exchanged for funding in a variety of contexts:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Impact Token triggers payment clause in a service contract tied to proof of delivery of vaccines</strong></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Impact Tokens triggers outcome payment in an impact bond tied to proof of outcome</strong></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Impact Token may be a carbon token representing a carbon offset which can be traded in the carbon markets</strong></p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Impact Tokens may open new markets for trading new forms of impact assets such as health tokens or gender tokens, as quantified standards and methodologies are adopted in other fields. The funder or purchaser of the Impact Tokens would receive access to each project&rsquo;s underlying impact data, providing greater transparency and accountability. </strong></p>

<p><strong>In the same way that Ethereum is a platform for user-generated ERC20 tokens, ixo is a protocol for user-generated Impact Tokens, which enable impact data to be shareable, tradeable and valuable. Imagine an ETF comprised of a portfolio of Impact Tokens, or an impact exchange where participants trade liquid impact bonds. Impact investing can become a true financial asset class, unlocking greater capital for projects. Marketplaces for impact data will grow, leading to better program optimizations.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Key functions of the ixo Protocol: &nbsp;</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Data collection using Web3C standardized data templates called impact claims, which are cryptographically signed using decentralized identifiers (DIDs). This allows data to be interoperable across databases. Data is accountable as it resolves to identifiers while preserving privacy. Data is collected from a variety of interfaces e.g. mobile, IoT, data oracles, drones. </strong></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Scaling of impact evaluation through use of data triangulation and software algorithms. </strong></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Global Impact Ledger that allows anyone to see and search high level project-based impact data. </strong></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Tokenization of verified impact data which enables the data to be monetized, shared or traded.</strong></p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Why the ixo matters:</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Audit trail and shared data layer for accountability and tracking of impact &ldquo;value chain&rdquo; </strong></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Richer data and greater transparency increases the fundamental value of impact investments and results-based finance instruments like carbon offsets and impact bonds</strong></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Impact Tokens can have better liquidity and lower transaction costs through peer-to-peer trading </strong></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Tokenization can spawn new asset class creation and new markets for social finance, unlocking greater capital to fulfill the Sustainable Development Goals</strong></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Access controls to data, which may contain personal identifying information, in order to be compliant with data privacy laws e.g. GDPR in EU</strong></p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Traction:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Our first project in South Africa, <a href="https://vimeo.com/252659135">Amply</a>, was UNICEF&rsquo;s first blockchain investment, which has, since November 2016, tokenized more than 60,000 pre-school attendance records that are exchanged for government subsidies. We have been awarded technical partner with the first social impact bond in South Africa to fund home-based education services. We are working with UBS Optimus Foundation on tokenizing an impact bond for girls education in India. We are also working with Gold Standard Foundation to originate carbon tokens from <a href="https://www.goldstandard.org/blog-item/gold-standard-improved-cookstove-activities-guidebook">cookstove</a> projects using IoT sensors. We also developed a mobile <a href="https://medium.com/ixo-blog/ixo-microsoft-hack-d381fff3cac7">identity SDK</a> with Microsoft that enables anyone to create digital identities. </strong></p>

          <div><p><strong>Jolocom uses blockchain and other decentralized technologies to build a virtual infrastructure that supports self-sovereign identity management by any subject, entity, or object connected to a network.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The open source protocol is a universal framework for interactions involving identity verification over the internet and is designed to drive adoption of self-sovereign identity at global scale as a common resource. Anyone and anything with an identity - companies, consumers, public institutions, state citizens, machines - benefits from a system that allows subjects of identity to control and truly own their digital selves. Jolocom&rsquo;s protocol for self-sovereign identity management finally makes it possible. Our protocol will manifest the following activities related to digital identity management:</strong></p>

<p><strong>● creating a self-sovereign identity for use by humans, organizations, and machines;</strong></p>

<p><strong>● attaching meaningful information to identities in the form of verifiable credentials;</strong></p>

<p><strong>● easily requesting and consuming verified information about identities in an automated fashion.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The vast majority of digital identities in existence today are not interoperable. That means there are currently millions of digital identity systems siloing personal data that serve no utility outside a single, isolated service environment. This system makes sensitive information vulnerable to hacks, which can cost a company billions, a government an election, and an individual his life and reputation. It&rsquo;s time for a new system, one that fosters healthy, productive relationships between us and our data.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Digital identities created using Jolocom&rsquo;s protocol are decentralized, making them portable: subjects of identity can carry their digital selves with them at all times for use across an unlimited number of networks and applications. Our model for digital identity effectively prevents a number of problems inherent to solutions employing centralized management, such as siloing sensitive user data on private servers (conducive to massive data breaches), redundancy of identity data and verification processes, and captive personal data. There&rsquo;s no limit to the number and scope of specialized software implementations our infrastructure can support, making the protocol an invaluable utility to businesses and consumers alike.</strong></p>

<p><strong>These product features set Jolocom apart from other identity management solutions on the market that effectively lock customers into relying on a standalone service that issues them their digital identity. An identity created with Jolocom&rsquo;s protocol can</strong></p>

<p><strong>persist across different networks and service environments - that&rsquo;s the key to a smart identity system.</strong></p>

<p><strong>With a team of just seven full-time employees, we have since 2014 led a wide array of implementation projects using and informing Jolocom&rsquo;s protocol and advanced several influential research studies concerning identity management (self-sovereign solutions in particular). An early contributing member of AGILE, a European Commission Horizon 2020 Research &amp; Innovation project, Jolocom provided specifications for machine interactions in IoT environments. We partnered with Fraunhofer FOKUS to conduct research on identity on the blockchain for the public sector. As part of Deutsche Telekom&rsquo;s T-Labs blockchain working group, Jolocom successfully built and implemented the identity layer of a prototype operating stack service that allows developers to build a decentralized backend in a matter of minutes; that prototype won Bosch Connected World 2018 logistics challenge.</strong></p>

<p><strong>In fact, we already offer a mobile identity management application that lets smartphone owners meaningfully interact with other people, services, and connected objects using our protocol; an alpha version of the Jolocom SmartWallet is available for Android devices (iOS forthcoming).</strong></p>

<p><strong>Projects we integrate with at DWeb: Ethereum, IPFS, BigchainDB, DID &amp; VC standards (DIF)</strong></p></div>

          <div class="science-fair-short-description">Knapsack for Hope is a satellite filecasting technology that uses common satellite equipment to deliver digital content without relying on access to the Internet.</div>
          <div><p>Knapsack for Hope is a satellite filecasting technology that uses common satellite equipment to deliver digital content without relying on access to the Internet. It distributes content that would otherwise be inaccessible to those who have limited or no internet access due to censorship, internet cost, living in a remote location, government-backed shutdowns, or unreliable technical infrastructure. Furthermore, it requires no hardware other than the conventional home TV satellite set-top box and a free-to-air satellite dish.<br />
<br />
Digital content and data is uploaded to a satellite and then encoded on a TV channel to users&rsquo; satellite TV dish. Users record this TV channel from their satellite set-top box to a USB drive. Upon transferring the USB to a smartphone or computer, Knapsack software decodes the transmitted content from the recorded TV channel to its original form, whether that be PDFs, JPEGs, HTMLs, MP3s, or others.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Knapsack is currently deployed in Iran and the Middle East as <em>Toosheh</em> - the Persian word for &ldquo;knapsack.&rdquo; Over 150,000 known users have downloaded Toosheh as means to gain access to content otherwise censored by the Iranian government. However the beauty of the technology lies in its ability to be adapted to a myriad number of environments (e.g. refugee camps or disaster recovering regions) and technologies (e.g. Peer-to-Peer sharing). In addition, Knapsack has successfully passed the first round of Mozilla&rsquo;s NSF Wireless Challenge.&nbsp;</p></div>

        <div class="modal-bio">
          <div class="science-fair-short-description">Security and privacy focused decentralized storage and communications platform</div>
          <div><p>MaidSafe was founded by David Irvine in 2006 with the mission to improve privacy and security for everyone on the planet. The solution is the SAFE (Secure Access For Everyone) Network, the world&rsquo;s first autonomous data network that prioritises the security and privacy of users&rsquo; data, managing all our information without human intervention.</p>

<h2>&nbsp;</h2>

<h1>&nbsp;</h1>

<h1><strong>The SAFE&nbsp;Network</strong></h1>

<h1>&nbsp;</h1>

<p>We need an autonomous network - one that manages all our data and communications without any human intervention or intermediaries.</p>

<p>The simplest way to think about an autonomous data network is one that configures itself. All data on the Network is automatically split into chunks and encrypted (utilising&nbsp;self-encryption) before being uploaded&nbsp;and then stored at random locations selected by the Network alone. There&#39;s no need for an IT administrator. Instead, nodes are free to join the network anonymously around the world. Upon joining, each node is moved into and out of small groups at random by the Network, again with no human intervention. These Close Groups now work together and make decisions on behalf of the Network (such as where to store data, who has authority to access data etc.).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The SAFE Network is also self-optimising as it creates additional copies of popular data in order to ensure greater availability of popular data requests. This feature also enables SAFE websites to actually speed up as they receive more visitors - unlike today&#39;s web where sites slow down, or even crash, if they&nbsp;receive too many visitors. Should the network split for any reason, for example through loss of power, it will merge as power is restored, and it will correct faults, such as detecting corrupt data chunks and automatically replacing them with good copies as a result of the networks ongoing data integrity checks.</p>

<p>Our design approach has been inspired by the humble ant whose millions of years of evolution influenced the network&rsquo;s design. Ant colonies exhibit complex and highly organised behaviour without a central authority based on a simple rule set whereby each ant fulfils different duties based on the needs of the colony. Nodes on the SAFE Network function in a similar manner carrying out different functions based on the types of messages they receive.</p>

<p>The ant colony shows us that this self-managing and self-organising behaviour is possible on a massive scale. Building a Network that doesn&#39;t require humans overseeing operations is necessary because humans at our worst get tired, emotional and make mistakes. Many data breaches are caused by human error and attackers rely on human interaction to carry out attacks. Human error has also played a significant part in problems with Silicon Valley&rsquo;s best known companies. Not only are humans prone to mistakes, it also reminds us that we rely on service providers to get access to our accounts and our data. We do not really own our information - access to our own data can be removed at any time by the providers either mistakenly or at the request of others. This is what we&#39;re looking to change with the SAFE Network.</p>

<h2>&nbsp;</h2>

<h1><strong>Security</strong></h1>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The SAFE Network is one in which data cannot be deleted, changed, corrupted, and/or accessed without the data owner&rsquo;s consent. This is possible because we are removing humans from the management of data so that storage locations are unknown to anyone but the network, whilst the user cannot be identified.</p>

<p>Any service where data is stored on servers, federated servers, owned storage locations, or on identifiable nodes, cannot ensure the security of data and brings us no closer to real unfettered ownership of our data. This also includes blockchain-based solutions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Autonomous things are already starting to have a huge benefit across a number of industries and we are just scratching the surface in finding out how they can positively impact upon our relationship with our data. Rather than making data more secure, the human element unfortunately has the opposite effect and can lead to data loss, theft, inaccessibility and a fundamental lack of ownership.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A change for the better, for us all - this is what we&#39;re building with the SAFE Network.&nbsp;</p></div>

          <div class="science-fair-short-description">Open standard for secure, decentralized, real-time communication</div>
          <div><p>Matrix is an open network and protocol for secure, decentralized, real-time communication.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Imagine a world where it is as simple to message or video call anyone as it is to send an email, where you can communicate without being forced to install the same app, where your data is secured by end-to-end encryption, where you can choose who hosts your communications, where you can easily share any kind of real-time data over the Internet: this is Matrix! Matrix is defined as an open standard with reference implementations of servers, clients and SDKs, providing the tools to build real-time communication applications and services which are not controlled by single corporations (like Facebook or Google), but by the users themselves.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Matrix can be used for:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>decentralised group chat with fully distributed persistent chatrooms with no single points of control or failure;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>WebRTC signaling as a web-friendly signalling transport for interoperable WebRTC calls;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Internet of Things use cases, by exchanging and persisting data between devices and services;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>VR calling, messaging and collaboration, by providing an open universal communication layer;</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>... and anywhere else you need a common data fabric to link together fragmented silos of communication. Our focus is on simplicity, security, and supporting the fullest feature set.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Matrix&rsquo;s initial inspiration and goal is to fix the problem of fragmented IP communications, but its real potential and ultimate mission is to be a generic messaging and data synchronisation system for the web - allowing people, services and devices to easily communicate with each other securely whilst maintaining full conversation history.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Matrix.org Foundation is currently being incorporated as non-profit initiative in the UK. It acts as a neutral guardian of the Matrix spec, nurturing and growing Matrix for the benefit of the whole ecosystem. Matrix&#39;s original core team has been building custom VoIP and Messaging solutions for mobile network operators since 2006 with extensive experience in SIP and XMPP, and created Matrix to provide a simpler web-friendly alternative to the wider world.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Matrix&#39;s success depends on the wider community&rsquo;s feedback and uptake: please come to <a href="http://matrix.org">Matrix.org</a> and take a look at the Matrix spec, or come and talk to us at <a href="https://matrix.to/#/!QtykxKocfZaZOUrTwp:matrix.org">#matrix:matrix.org</a>, or check out the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/">code</a> and run your own Matrix server!</p>

          <div><p>The assets of a majority of the world&#39;s population are physically visible, but economically and politically invisible. This project estimates that 2.5 billion people have access to formal property rights. This formalization gives them access to the value of their properties whether in the form of credit or credentials. The other 5 billion have no access, and, thus cannot tap into the value of the land they manage, use, and own. Medici Ventures is using blockchain among other technologies to bring property ownership information to light and connect it to the global economy.</p>

<p>Making informal property records global, transparent, and resistant to corruption will make use of the decentralized and immutable properties of blockchain technology. Using Open Index Protocol (OIP), Medici Ventures is developing a data model for property rights information that works with OIP defining indexable metadata for any property-related content. The data model organizes property information into party, spatial unit, and tenure artifacts. Additionally, the model provides for endorsements, which allow for affirmations of claims. All information is supported with a source artifact that provides references to files stored in decentralized storage.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Live video streaming over content addressable storage (IPFS)</li>
	<li>Sharing of multimedia content over a peer-to-peer social network (SSB)</li>
	<li>Mesh networking over long-range wireless links using open hardware (LibreRouter)</li>
</ul>

<p>Each physical node consists of a LibreRouter + a Raspberry Pi, running software developed by Toronto Mesh that use IPFS and SSB. One node will stream video off of a Raspberry Pi camera, publishes to the private IPFS and SSB network formed by these devices, then other nodes can view the embedded player on the SSB timeline of the video publisher. The user experience is similar to streaming a YouTube video and sharing the link on your Facebook, then your friends discover that video via their social feed and view the live stream from the embedded player.</p>

          <div class="science-fair-short-description">Decentralized naming system based on Bitcoin algorithms, code, and threat model</div>
          <div><p>Namecoin is the first naming system that is simultaneously global (everyone gets the same result for the same lookup), decentralized (no central party decides which names map to which values), and human-meaningful (names aren&rsquo;t just a hash or something similarly opaque to humans). &nbsp;Previous naming systems such as the DNS, .onion, and .i2p are unable to simultaneously achieve all 3 of these properties.<br />
Namecoin achieves this by recognizing that Bitcoin&rsquo;s achievement of a decentralized consensus (via a Nakamoto blockchain) has applications outside of the financial system, including naming. &nbsp;Namecoin was the first fork of Bitcoin (we forked Bitcoin before it was cool), and extends Bitcoin&rsquo;s blockchain validation rules to allow coins to represent human-readable names with arbitrary values attached. &nbsp;The Namecoin blockchain validation rules enforce that all transactions in the blockchain honor uniqueness of names, and that only the owner of a name can update its value. Namecoin&rsquo;s threat model is very similar to that of Bitcoin: like Bitcoin, Namecoin is mined via Hashcash-SHA256D proof-of-work, and inclusion in the blockchain of a transaction (even if checked via a lightweight client) implies that miners have verified the transaction&rsquo;s correctness.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Namecoin&rsquo;s current and proposed use cases include a more censorship-resistant and privacy-respecting alternative to the DNS, a decentralized public key infrastructure for protocols like TLS, OpenPGP, and OTR, a DNS-like functionality for darknet protocols such as Tor onion services, I2P, and Freenet, and single sign-on for website users.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Namecoin has been endorsed by WikiLeaks, has been favorably mentioned in a technical report by ICANN, is funded by NLnet Foundation&rsquo;s Internet Hardening Fund using funding originating from the Netherlands Ministry of Economic Affairs, and (for a 48-hour period in 2017) had higher hashrate than Bitcoin. &nbsp;Namecoin has an international development team, and is always looking for new contributors. We&rsquo;d also love to collaborate with your project.</p>

          <div><p><strong>Ninja<br />
the anonymous exchange of anything </strong></p>

<p><strong>The evolution of trade and exchanges is one of the most significant stories in the journey of mankind. Here&rsquo;s our addition to the newest chapter - a decentralized platform that allows ninjas (its users) to discover different exchanges built by other ninjas (its developers), and to trade crypto assets on these exchanges directly with each other, anonymously, and trustlessly.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Developers, think of Ninja as the modern day version of the App Store. Instead of developing apps, you&rsquo;ll build decentralized exchanges for crypto assets. Keep it free, use your own in-exchange tokens, or charge transaction fees.</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Users, Ninja is the modern day version of Craigslist. Ninja users will be able to trade different crypto assets with one another anonymously and trustlessly &mdash; with no central authority or middlemen.</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Ninja is anonymous. Ninja uses public/private keypair for authentication. No download required. You can use Ninja with complete privacy.</strong></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Ninja is peer-to-peer. Ninja doesn&rsquo;t require middlemen, which means no fees, no bureaucracy, and no restriction.</strong></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Ninja is trustless. Agreements programmed as smart contracts replace reluctant trust with cryptographic proof. Anonymous users from anywhere in the world can now enter in an agreement without the need for a trusted third party.</strong></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Ninja is permissionless. Ninja allows anyone to create an address and begin interacting with other people on the Ninja network. Anyone can build and launch exchanges.</strong></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Ninja is decentralized. Designed with the new decentralized Internet primitives Ethereum (code) and IPFS (storage), Ninja aims to provide a product without a single point of failure, that also ensures users can safely own their data.</strong></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Ninja is transparent. The entire development of Ninja is<a href="https://github.com/ninjadotorg/"> open-sourced on Github</a>.</strong></p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p><br />
<strong>The first two Exchanges are now live.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Prediction Exchange allows parties to directly bet against each other without going through a central authority or bookmaker. The management of bets and the settlement of winnings are carried out collectively by the blockchain network, protecting users from any single point of failure. Prediction Exchange has unique properties that allow exciting use cases, previously impossible under any traditional betting mechanism</strong></p>

<p><strong><a href="https://medium.com/@ninja_org/shakeninja-bex-1c938f18b3e8">Read more about Prediction Exchange here.</a></strong></p>

<p><strong>Cash Exchange is a decentralized, anonymous, peer to peer (P2P) cryptocurrency exchange, which allows users from all over the world to buy and sell cryptocurrencies. You don&rsquo;t need a bank account to use Ninja. This means that in addition to benefiting users that prefer not to leave a paper trail, over 2 billion unbanked people in the world, who are currently restricted when it comes to using traditional platforms will now be able to join the movement towards the decentralized future of money. </strong></p>

          <div><h3><strong>What is Ocean Protocol?</strong></h3>

<p><strong>Ocean Protocol is an ecosystem for sharing data and associated services. It provides a tokenized service layer that exposes data, storage, compute and algorithms for consumption with a set of deterministic proofs on availability and integrity that serve as verifiable service agreements. There is staking on services to signal quality, reputation and ward against Sybil Attacks.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Ocean helps to unlock data, particularly for AI. It is designed for scale and uses blockchain technology that allows data to be shared and sold in a safe, secure and transparent manner.</strong></p>

<h3>&nbsp;</h3>

<h3><strong>How Ocean Protocol Works</strong></h3>

<p><strong>The Ocean Protocol is an ecosystem composed of data assets and services, where assets are represented by data and algorithms, and services are represented by integration, processing and persistence mechanisms. Ocean Protocol facilitates discovery by storing and promoting metadata, linking assets and services, and provides a licensing framework that has toolsets for pricing.</strong></p>

<p><strong>A multitude of data marketplaces can hook into Ocean Protocol to provide &ldquo;last mile&rdquo; services to connect data providers and consumers. Ocean Protocol is designed so that data owners cannot be locked-in to any single marketplace. The data owner controls each dataset.</strong></p>

          <div><p><strong>OmiseGO is a subsidiary of <a href="https://www.omise.co/">Omise</a>, a leading online payment gateway service provider operating in Southeast Asia. The OmiseGO blockchain team has been involved in the Ethereum community from its very beginning--starting in 2015, Omise Blockchain Lab began research work focusing primarily on scalability. At this time, OmiseGO is focusing on building Plasma architecture as a scalability solution for the Ethereum ecosystem.</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>OmiseGO is building public financial infrastructure to securely process high transaction volume, rooted to the Ethereum blockchain, including:</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p><strong>OMG Network, a blockchain-based financial network powered by Plasma architecture and secured with Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus with the OMG token</strong></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Decentralized exchange mechanism, built directly into the OMG blockchain to facilitate currency-agnostic transactions</strong></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>eWallet SDK, open source tools that will allow anyone to easily build a wallet or application to integrate with the OMG Network</strong></p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>For greater detail on these features, please refer to our latest <a href="https://blog.omisego.network/omisego-roadmap-update-94819e20ada2">roadmap update</a>. </strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>At OmiseGO, we are building a currency-agnostic financial platform for all - banked and unbanked users alike. We are committed to decentralizing value transfer to mitigate the opportunity for fraud, manipulation, centralized friction and enable access to users that otherwise may be excluded from closed financial systems.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The OMG Network will be built using Plasma chain architecture; originally conceived by Joseph Poon (creator of Lightning Network) and Vitalik Buterin (creator of Ethereum), that allows &ldquo;child&rdquo; blockchains to interact with &ldquo;root&rdquo; blockchains, to enable scalability. We are excited to be conducting in-depth research on design and incentives within a Plasma ecosystem, and will be implementing Plasma to support high transaction volume on the OMG Network. The OMG Network will be secured through PoS consensus by having OMG token holders stake their tokens to validate transactions on Plasma.</strong></p>

<p><strong>By leveraging our decentralized exchange mechanism, all OMG Network users will have the flexibility to store and transact with their preferred currency. Accessible by any digital wallet or account, users will no longer require permission from a banking system or government on which assets they are allowed to hold and which financial services they can use. </strong></p>

<p><strong>Lastly, to enable usage of the OMG Network, we are building a public and free eWallet SDK. Individual consumers and companies can build on top of the SDK to create a customized wallet through which they can cash-in/cash-out value to conduct transactions on the OMG Network. We believe this is a critical component to ensuring that both financially included and excluded users can easily access to decentralized financial platforms on Ethereum.</strong></p>

<p><strong>In short, what this means is OpenTimestamps can prove data existed in the past, rather than being recently created in the present. Since adversaries don&#39;t have time machines, that can often prove rule out certain kinds of attacks. For instance, a timestamp on a digital signature can prove that the signature was created prior to the secret key being stolen. Or a timestamp on an archived video of a speech could prove that the video was created prior to anyone realising how important it would be. This doesn&#39;t by itself guarantee that the data is real - maybe someone had a reason to fake the video five years ago? -but it&#39;s often good evidence that it is.</strong></p></div>

          <div class="science-fair-short-description">Cooperative P2P caching and routing of web content to avoid connectivity issues.</div>
          <div><p>Ouinet is a Free/Open Source technology which allows web content to be served with the help of an entire network of cooperating nodes using peer-to-peer routing and distributed caching of responses.&nbsp; This helps mitigate the Web&#39;s characteristic single point of failure due to a client application not being able to connect to a particular server.<br />
<br />
The typical Ouinet client node setup consists of a web browser or other application using a special HTTP proxy or API provided by a dedicated program or library on the local machine.&nbsp; When the client gets a request for content, it attempts to retrieve the resource using several mechanisms.&nbsp; It tries to fetch the page from a distributed cache (like IPFS), and if not available, it contacts a trusted injector server over a peer-to-peer routing system (like I2P) and asks it to fetch the page and store it in the distributed cache.<br />
<br />
Future accesses by client nodes to popular content inserted in distributed storage shall benefit from an increased redundancy and locality, which translates in increased availability in the face of connectivity problems, increased transfer speeds in case or poor upstream links, and reduced bandwidth costs when access providers charge more for external or international traffic.&nbsp; Content injection is also designed in a way which allows for content re-introduction and seeding on extreme cases of total connectivity loss (e.g. natural disasters).<br />
<br />
The Ouinet library is a core technology that can be used by any application to benefit from these advantages.&nbsp; Ouinet integration provides any content creator the opportunity to use cooperative networking and storage for the delivery of their content to users around the world.</p></div>

          <div><p><strong>P2P Models</strong></p>

<p><strong>Decentralized Blockchain-based Organizations for Bootstrapping the Collaborative Economy</strong></p>

<p><strong>P2P Models is a large research project to build Blockchain-powered organizations which are decentralized, democratic and distribute their profits, in order to boost a new type of Collaborative Economy (<a href="https://twitter.com/samerP2P/status/928820944705130498">tweet thread</a>). The project has three legs:</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Infrastructure: Provide a software framework to build decentralized infrastructure for Collaborative Economy organizations that do not depend on central authorities. </strong></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Governance: Enable democratic-by-design models of governance for communities, whose rules are, at least partially, encoded in the software to ensure higher levels of equality. </strong></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Economy: Enable value distribution models which are interoperable across organizations, improving the economic sustainability of both contributors and organizations. </strong></p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>The Collaborative Economy is rapidly expanding, but it is dominated by centralized web platforms which hold user data and concentrate all decision-making power and profits.</strong></p>

<p><strong>P2P Models is a 1.5M&euro; EU-funded interdisciplinary research effort for bootstrapping the emergence of a new generation of self-governed and more economically sustainable peer-to-peer Collaborative Economy communities. It is a 5-year project (2017-2022) which will be based in the Universidad Complutense de Madrid (Spain), with Principal Investigator and advisors from the <a href="http://cyber.harvard.edu/">Berkman Klein Center</a> (Harvard University).</strong></p>

<p><strong>The project will contribute to the Blockchain ecosystem, from a commons-oriented approach (not focused on finance). It will build software modules, grounded on social theory, for the easy building of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations that aim to support collaborative communities. You may get a deeper insight of the project in <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S8yKtUxyPV4OZAACe3JCwCmTN9sarr7g4V4IMSoELhc/edit">this 5-page project summary</a>.</strong></p>

          <div><p><strong>People&#39;s Open Network works with communities to build and operate wireless networks. We provide open source software, off-the-shelf hardware, and educational materials used to host workshops, train operators, and install nodes. Our prototype consists of over 40 nodes in the Bay Area sharing paid internet subscriptions with unconnected neighbors. We&rsquo;re currently working on building access to gigabits of donated bandwidth (via Internet Archive and Paxio) and connecting a homeless camp in Berkeley</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Our solution is designed for a city like Oakland, a community with a widening class and digital divide. Nearly a quarter of households here have no computer access at home, and more than a fifth of homes lack internet access at home despite its close proximity to Silicon Valley.</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The People&rsquo;s Open Network is primarily targeted at three types of people: </strong></p>

<p><strong>1) those who want to share a single internet connection with their neighbors; </strong></p>

<p><strong>2) those who cannot afford the monthly subscription through a corporate internet service; and/or </strong></p>

<p><strong>3) those interested in learning how the internet works. </strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>We can be replicated in a decentralized manner across urban environments with a socioeconomically diverse population of stakeholders &mdash; such as families, individuals, businesses, encampments, and community spaces. In addition to distributing access to the wider internet, our solution can lead to local mesh internets that are independent of ISPs.</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>We have begun to implement our network in the SF Bay Area, a densely-populated, hilly, coastal region. We use the area&rsquo;s mixed elevation to our advantage to get line-of-sight between homes and buildings across long distances. Our target community and environment has not changed since our last submission.</strong></p></div>

          <div><p><strong>If you think about it, there is no reason why signals have to travel to a Facebook server 3000 miles away just to plan a local dinner or outing with friends. Students in a class should be able to connect with one another and collaborate on documents without using Google Docs. The same is true of passengers on a plane, or shipmates on a cruise, or villagers in Nigeria. Local networks should suffice.</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Software to unite communities</strong></p>

<p><strong>All this growing local infrastructure unlocks the potential for people to connect with one another on a local level without relying on the ISPs. However, until now there has been a lack of good software to run on this infrastructure. The platforms people use today are almost invariably centralized and require access to the global internet. Facebook, Twitter, Amazon, GMail, Apple, Microsoft, Instagram, WhatsApp, SnapChat, Etsy, Netflix, Uber, you name it &ndash; they get venture-funded, get a bunch of people on both sides of a market, and extract rents. They have 1 engineer per million users, or less. Customer support is non-existent. They choose what features you have and what interface you see. They have the people&rsquo;s data in one place, and sometimes that makes an attractive target for governments and advertisers. In a recent article, we&nbsp;covered this situation&nbsp;in more detail.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Since Qbix released our first apps back in 2011, we has been steadily developing our&nbsp;Platform&nbsp;to power community apps. Now it turns out that this Platform is a perfect fit for the mesh networks springing up, allowing people to enjoy use apps running on local servers, and get high-speed connections to one another, without even needing to connect to the global internet. Once in a while, a message needs to be sent globally, but most of the time, what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas.</strong></p>

<p><strong>We recently paid a company called&nbsp;Antamedia&nbsp;to develop OpenWRT firmware that runs on many popular commercial routers. This firmware now allows communities to run our entire social platform and apps off of their local wifi. Imagine coming to class and having attendance taken automatically, because your phone connects to the local wifi hotspot. Imagine having messages stay private in the classroom, or unlocking rewards from actually being physically present at a concert, and so on.</strong></p>

<p><strong>As time goes on, we are continuing to push the boundaries of what&rsquo;s possible in this space. Our next goal is to release software to turn an Android phone into a hotspot, allowing people to host a local community on demand wirelessly just from their Android phone. Even when they&rsquo;re out camping. And the social apps built on our platform should work on all these networks, whether it&rsquo;s a wifi router, an Android phone, a mesh network, or a website on the global internet.</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Money to unite communities</strong></p>

<p><strong>In the last few years, all major social networks have added the ability for users to pay one another. It&rsquo;s not just PayPal and Venmo anymore: you can now send money in&nbsp;GMail,&nbsp;Facebook Messenger, and now even&nbsp;iMessage. In China, WeChat (the chat application) has become a&nbsp;huge payment networkwithin a few short years. People can now pay with WeChat at restaurants and other businesses across the country, and cash is rapidly becoming obsolete.</strong></p>

<p><strong>With the recent proliferation of interest in crypto-currencies and blockchain software, we got to thinking, why not help communities issue and manage their own money supply? This was our vision for social networking, but translated to the realm money. Instead of having large, global one-size-fits-all currencies (US Dollars or Bitcoin) we could once again give communities the power to determine their own fate.</strong></p>

<p><strong>So, starting 2017, we launched a spinoff company called Intercoin Inc. to do just that. Where Qbix focuses on social networking, the&nbsp;Intercoin project&nbsp;focuses on building the&nbsp;infrastructure&nbsp;to run a secure and resilient payment network. Similar to Facebook and GMail, Paypal and Stripe, we would implement buttons that app developers and website publishers could easily add in order to seamless get paid in the local currency. Prices would be displayed in the currency of the user&rsquo;s choice, and Intercoin would make cashing in and out of currencies seamless.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Just like Qbix Platform enables local apps where most actions work without access to the global internet, the Intercoin project enables innovations in local community fintech.&nbsp;Basic Income&nbsp;becomes achievable by any community. All citizens can see how the money is being used, spot issues and deal with them as a community. Governance can be done in a democratic manner. The money supply can be controlled by the people instead of the elites, leveraging the&nbsp;wisdom of the crowd.</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Decentralizing the gatekeepers</strong></p>

<p><strong>There is another huge benefit of letting communities install and run open-source software. Qbix Platform and Intercoin enables a richer developer system (just like the Web has done). Developers of apps and plugins don&rsquo;t have to worry about some gatekeepers kicking them out of the App Store, or revoking their API keys while they build a competing product. Each developer can market to entire communities, who can then recommend the app to one another. Communities can do the work of promoting the app to their own members, while the apps would make it easier for the communities to engage their members and give them tools to get together and feel connected.</strong></p>

<p><strong>So that&rsquo;s the vision: empowering people, uniting communities. When communities need more apps, they can band together and organically raise funds to pay developers to build and maintain them. It&rsquo;s an open ecosystem where collaboration leads to more and more positive feedback loops.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Communities don&rsquo;t necessarily have to be local. A person can belong to several communities, including their neighborhood, city, and a poets&rsquo; guild. They can get $20 a day Basic Income from the city and another $5 from the poets&rsquo; guild. This can help decrease poverty, food insecurity, and lead to increased freedom and prosperity.</strong></p></div>

          <div class="science-fair-short-description">A decentralized social communication protocol, an active international community</div>
          <div><p>Scuttlebutt aims to <em>harmonize</em> four perspectives of life:</p>

<p><strong>Environment</strong> reflecting <strong>Technology</strong> reflecting <strong>Community</strong> reflecting <strong>Society</strong>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;We acknowledge the natural, the virtual, and the social environments. Our responsibility is to recognize which resources are <strong>abundant</strong>, which are <strong>sufficient</strong>, and adapt accordingly through <strong>efficiency</strong>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Technology is simply the means by which we communicate. We use <strong>local-first</strong> publishing so that each person owns their words and actions. Our solutions are piecemeal <strong>upgradeable</strong>, replaceable and incrementally improvable. Tending and pruning are not a stranger&#39;s duty, it is through <strong>near moderation</strong> and <strong>free listening</strong> that we improve our surroundings. Infrastructure is a voluntary act, <strong>multimodal welcoming</strong> is how we on-board people via diverse connectivity modes (technological acts of&nbsp;</p>

<p>inclusion) as well as with greetings (words of inclusion). No one &quot;signs up&quot; but everyone is invited.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;Our community is a web of friendships: relationships defined not by a follow button, but by the flexibility of <strong>subjectivity</strong>. We cherish the freedom to be <strong>independent</strong>, but it is this same freedom which encourages &ndash; not coerces &ndash; us to be <strong>interdependent</strong>. We know we can at any time <em>fork,</em> but when individually recognizing the whole being greater than the sum of its parts, we tend to develop the collective. We value disagreement when it&#39;s supportive, and see it as generative and bond forming.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Society is not made of homogeneous people, so we must allow <strong>pluralism</strong> of cultures to flourish. The edges of the social graph must extend to <strong>include</strong> all people and their diverse values, interactions, and customs. No one of us can build a welcoming place for all groups, because the very concept of welcoming is subjective. We must instead design platforms that are <em>easy to re-design</em>, removing us as arbiters of other communities.</p></div>

<p><strong>Previous personal information managers (WinFS, BFS, Haystack. . . ) laid out what could be achieved if a knowledge worker stores her personal information in a database filesystem, a filesystem where files can be accompanied by typed, queryable metadata that&rsquo;s stored in a system-wide, shared database. &ldquo;Tagging&rdquo; your documents with (typed!) metadata makes it possible to build reusable data processing pipelines out of composable applications, applications whose inputs and outputs are well-defined in terms of mutually-understood types.</strong></p>

<p><strong>While these tools haven&rsquo;t quite caught on, recent developments in decentralized tech present great opportunities for new experimentation. A decentralized semantic desktop provides the same storage/query interfaces, while also giving users the features they expect from modern, empowering storage system:</strong></p>

<p><strong>1. Version control: All edits should be retained in timelines, which can be</strong></p>

<p><strong>rewound, branched, and forked. 2. P2P syncing: Any version of a filesystem can be shared and synced with a</strong></p>

<p><strong>single link. 3. Easy backups: An archiver is just another peer that eagerly synchronizes</strong></p>

<p><strong>every change. 4. Multi-user collaboration: A filesystem need not live on a single machine &ndash;</strong></p>

<p><strong>multiple users must be able to work together.</strong></p>

<p><strong>(These features are achieved by building on the Dat stack, described below)</strong></p>

<p><strong>What is it?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Seedpod currently runs as a cross-platform Electron application. It&rsquo;s primary UI allows users to create workspaces, isolated information stores oriented around a common task or context, into which they install applications. App developers are provided with familiar File (mirrors NodeJS&rsquo;s fs module) and Database (similar to MongoDB) APIs. Each application must declare its data model (described in an interface file) to the Seedpod package manager at installation time &ndash; this provides a pathway for dynamic composition through schema sharing.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Once an application has been authorized to write to a workspace, it can use the Database API to store documents that match the schemas defined in its interface file. Seedpod will automatically expand these documents into sets of RDF triples, stored in the workspace&rsquo;s shared graph database, which can then be explored using a SPARQL-like graph query language.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Seedpod&rsquo;s core data structures are built on top of the Dat stack (specifically hyperdb and hypercore), which provides workspaces with many of the powerful</strong></p></div>

          <div class="science-fair-short-description">Let eval() into your heart: SES enables safe evaluation of untrusted
Javascript source code, so mutually-suspicious programs can interact
without being too vulnerable to each other.</div>
          <div><p>The web means Javascript. The decentralized web means your Javascript<br />
interacting with other people&#39;s Javascript, both of which might be<br />
buggy, exploitable, malicious, or simply confused. The user&#39;s agent will<br />
be combining different code from different authors, each with their<br />
own set of motivations and interests. We benefit greatly from close<br />
interaction between these components, but we must also guard against<br />
accident or malice.<br />
<br />
There are ways to safely run mutually-suspicious code inside the same<br />
program, using small language modifications to enable an approach named<br />
Object Capability Security. Our Secure ECMAScript (&quot;SES&quot;) environment<br />
replaces the unsafe one-argument eval(code) with a safe two-argument<br />
eval(code, endowments): we call it &quot;safe&quot; because the new eval() does<br />
not grant access to the caller&#39;s global scope, from which it might<br />
access storage or the network. The evaluated code&#39;s only access to the<br />
outside world is through the endowments, and the code doing the<br />
evaluation can grant or withhold those however it wishes.<br />
<br />
SES also freezes the so-called &quot;primordials&quot;: objects like Math, String,<br />
and Array that provide Javascript&#39;s built-in functionality. Frozen<br />
objects cannot be modified, preventing the evaluated code from doing<br />
surprising-yet-legal things like changing the behavior of Array, which<br />
could interfere with the correct execution of unrelated (and<br />
unsuspecting) programs.<br />
<br />
A close analogy to this feature is the popular use of Lua as a plugin<br />
language for videogames. These plugins can modify the behavior of the<br />
game, but do not get the authority to e.g. read/write arbitrary portions<br />
of the host&#39;s disk, or speak directly to the network (perhaps to inject<br />
ads or spy upon the player). The plugin comes from a different author<br />
than the game it modifies, and the game is trying to mediate between the<br />
interests of the plug-in author and the player of the game, who wants to<br />
enhance the game somehow without risking more than the integrity of<br />
their gameplay.<br />
<br />
The SES environment is available for testing now, in both web and<br />
Node.js contexts, at&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/Agoric/SES" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">https://github.com/Agoric/SES</a>&nbsp;. We&#39;re still working<br />
on documentation and examples, but a few demos are available in the<br />
repository. It depends upon a Javascript feature named &quot;Realms&quot; which is<br />
currently available as a shim, but which is also on the TC39 standards<br />
track to become an official part of ECMAScript.<br />

          <div><p><strong>Sharing and Preserving&nbsp;Cultural Heritage Materials Using Scientific&nbsp;Digital Representations</strong></p>

<p><strong>We will demonstrate open source software tools that produce scientific digital representations captured with off-the-shelf digital cameras and photo gear. These tools greatly simplify metadata collection, essential to the scientific documentary imaging of &ldquo;digital surrogates.&rdquo; The tools organize these digital surrogates and metadata into standards-based Submission Information Packages (SIPs) for archival delivery and intake. This archival package includes all the information necessary for informed data reuse by others, both now and in the future. The tools are for use by cultural heritage practitioners in museums, libraries, and historic sites, as well as by local citizen caretakers around the world. </strong></p>

<p><strong>The tools are designed to support imaging methods based on computational photography. These include Reflectance Transformation Imaging (RTI); photogrammetry for 3D model creation; and spectral imaging. </strong></p>

<p><strong>The current project is funded by a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities. It builds on prior work that has already produced two tools: DLN:Capture Context, for collecting rich metadata about the capture of image sets; and DLN:Inspector for validating image sets against rules for each technology. These tools form the basis of the Digital Lab Notebook (DLN). The DLN serves the same function as a written scientist&rsquo;s lab notebook, enabling data inspection and reuse by others. Metadata is produced as Linked Open Data mapped to the CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model (CRM) semantic ontology. &nbsp;The CRM is an ISO standard created by the International Council of Museums (ICOM) and was recently adopted by the International Federation of Library Associations (IFLA). This is the first time the international museum and library communities have agreed to recommend a shared metadata standard.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The lead organization for the project is Cultural Heritage Imaging (CHI), A non-profit based in San Francisco. &nbsp;The project&rsquo;s primary grant partner is the Institute for Cultural Informatics at the Institute of Computer Science of the Foundation for Research and Technology Hellas (FORTH) in Heraklion Crete. </strong></p>

<p><strong>The Design Principles for the project require that the software tools must be:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Easy and efficient to use</strong></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Flexible to allow users to input as much or as little information as they deem appropriate</strong></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Free of perceived complexity: All of the complexity of the semantic ontology&ndash; the CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model &ndash; and Linked Open Data standards, must be &ldquo;under the hood&rdquo; so users need not know about them.</strong></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Open source &ndash;to promote sustainability and customization by others</strong></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Internationalized so the tools can be translated and localized to other languages and cultures</strong></p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>We at Cultural Heritage Imaging believe the treasures of humanity are worth saving. Our goal is to democratize the use of imaging tools to save humanity&rsquo;s imperiled cultural legacy.</strong></p></div>

          <div><p><strong>Solid is an exciting new project led by Prof. Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, taking place at&nbsp;<a href="http://mit.edu/">MIT</a>. The project aims to radically change the way Web applications work today, resulting in true data ownership as well as improved privacy.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Solid (derived from &quot;social linked data&quot;) is a proposed set of conventions and tools for building decentralized social applications based on Linked Data principles. Solid is modular and extensible, and it relies as much as possible on existing W3C standards and protocols.</strong></p>

<p><strong>At a glance, here is what Solid offers...</strong></p>

<p><strong>True data ownership</strong></p>

<p><strong>Users should have the freedom to choose where their data resides and who is allowed to access it. By decoupling content from the application, itself, users are now able to do so.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Modular design</strong></p>

<p><strong>Because applications are decoupled from the data they produce, users will be able to avoid vendor lock-in, seamlessly switching between apps and personal data storage servers, without losing any data or social connections.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Reusing existing data</strong></p>

<p><strong>Developers will be able to easily innovate by creating new apps or improving current apps, all while reusing existing data that was created by other apps.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The Solid team has encapsulated several years of research and prototyping by a talented group of contributors, led by Tim, into a Node.js based implementation of the Solid server specification, and a basic data browser to allow users to play with the system.</strong></p></div>

          <div class="science-fair-short-description">Subsect is a light weight general purpose platform for serving web content from Android and iOS devices.</div>
          <div><p>Subsect installs as a standard app and does not require root access. Subsect could be best described as a personal web server (PWS). It is based on the concept that every human being on the planet should have logical and physical control of their data and generated content in a convenient manner. This objective is currently best achieved by hosting on a mobile device.</p>

<p>Subsect is a functioning product although it is still alpha grade software. It is an open source project.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Subsect is not an alternative architecture. It is consistent with the current web model of a server answering requests from a browser. It does allow for extensions to the current arrangement which does not expect each user to also have their own server. Designing web software with this assumption opens many new avenues with regard to interfaces and storage. Due to limitations on accessing port 80 on mobile devices, Subsect uses WebRTC for transport. This is a minor limitation and doesn&rsquo;t impede exploring what can be done in a PWS environment. This may be a transitionary product on the path to the day when all people have at least one fixed IPv6 address as a birthright and a device to make use of it.</p>

<p>Individuals are powerless if they do not control their own data. Legal rights to access need to be clear with 2nd parties who could be forced into entering into EULA type agreements. Handing data over for only usage rights and then expecting to influence later behaviour is hopeless. Physical possession of data with the retention of copyright is the strongest position for balancing the asymmetries that exist in the current web model.</p></div>

          <div><p><strong>Subspace: A Decentralized Database of End-User Devices</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Ownership and control over user generated data on the Internet is one of the defining social and technical issues of our time. These concerns have led to a renewed interest in decentralized web technologies among ​application developers​ who want to build services which allow users to own their data. A purely peer-to-peer storage network would allow users to have full control over data they generate on the Internet without going through a remote server. Users could host their data directly on devices they already own, while replicating it across other devices on the network in a secure and persistent manner. &nbsp;Subspace is a decentralized key-value store with a familiar Javascript API that makes it easy for developers to build apps where users may own their data. </strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Subspace Database (SSDB) allows developers to easily manage application state within a decentralized app, or ​dApp​. ​dApps​ provide services over the Internet without a central server. Current constructions rely on blockchain based smart contract platforms such as Ethereum for application code and Decentralized Storage Networks (DSNs) such as the Interplanetary File System (IPFS) for file hosting. Mutable application state management, in the form of a decentralized database, remains an unsolved problem. In Subspace, data is stored across a peer-to-peer (P2P) network of end user devices who act as hosts by pledging free space in return for subspace credits. </strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>SSDB is massively sharded amongst a network of internet enabled host devices that may include mobile phones, tablets, desktop computers, and traditional servers. A javascript client library with a simple put(), get() Application Programming Interface (API) is provided to developers, allowing them to store and retrieve data inside any web, mobile, desktop, or server-side app. Anyone who uses these apps has full ownership and control of the data they generate, through their private key. </strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Hosts pledge free space to the network in return for regular distributions of subspace credits from client apps and users. These agreements are encoded as smart contracts on a distributed ledger secured by Proof of Space consensus. All records are stored off-chain, while being replicated and encrypted at rest in a cryptographically secure schema spread across multiple devices, with a verifiable proof of replication. Each record stored in SSDB is guaranteed to persist with a replication factor (R) in a manner that is self-healing as hosts leave the network. Space utilization is load balanced across all hosts proportional to the amount of space pledged. Subspace aims to be a simpler construction of a decentralized storage network focused on developer usability that seeks mass adoption by end users.</strong></p>

          <div><p><strong>The InfoCentral Project is..</strong></p>

<p><strong>A Long-Range Architectural Approach to Decentralization</strong></p>

<p><strong>InfoCentral proposes an information-centered architecture for decentralized systems and dynamic user environments. It is primarily concerned with data portability, semantics, and interoperability &ndash; while making all information social and collaborative by default. Rather than starting with APIs or protocols, information is the platform -- a neutral foundation that software and networks can evolve around.</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>A Unifier of Decentralized Internet Technologies</strong></p>

<p><strong>Many projects have produced valuable ideas and inspiration. Unfortunately, their contributions are often difficult to combine. Consensus on shared foundations is needed to integrate the best ideas into a unified technology ecosystem. InfoCentral&#39;s minimalist, graph-oriented data model provides a foundation to promote collaboration and cross-pollination among decentralized internet technology projects.</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>A New Hypermedia for the Information-Centric Internet</strong></p>

<p><strong>The InfoCentral Persistent Data Model is an extensible, cryptography-minded, legacy-free standard for containing, linking, and layering all types of data, with no dependence on particular infrastructure. It is not a blockchain, but it can support these and other higher-order data models. We propose the Persistent Data Model as the &quot;thin neck&quot; of the future decentralized, content-addressed internet. By mandating independence from centralized components and hierarchical structures, InfoCentral&#39;s hypermedia design ensures that all information is fluid and recomposable by users and software agents.</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>A Post-Application Software Architecture</strong></h3>

<p><strong>The software architecture native to decentralized graph information brings a whole new paradigm for user environments. The future is app-free computing &ndash; fully integrated, composable, and adaptive software functionality that comes alongside neutral information rather than creating artificial boundaries or limiting users to certain interactions and modalities. Post-application software architecture makes heavy use of declarative programming paradigms. This promotes runtime composition and customization, giving users total control and flexibility. It is also is a great fit for future AI software agents that are currently limited by clumsy human-centric UIs and APIs.</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>A Fresh Vision for Social Computing</strong></p>

<p><strong>Collaboration, contextualization, and community-building need to become default, baked into the architecture of information rather than relying on particular services or networks. The modern world needs an internet that is robust against misinformation and extremism &ndash; where the best quality and most useful information rises to the top. Societies need portable digital trust and other tools that make it easier to build community. Consumers need empowered to act rationally through reliable, unbiased information. These sorts of issues are largely dependent on the ability to reliably reference and neutrally layer information with third party annotations, a primary design concern of our Persistent Data Model.</strong></p>

          <div><p><strong>﻿Participants contribute tokenized art to an open collection for the purposes of public exposure and record. Open access to submissions and equal exposure to all works are central, however the focus is to push Creative Commons into tokenization by utilizing send memos and other protocol level methodology of declaring licence for reproduction upon delivery. While any user may submit any work of art, only sends from the origin account will be authorized to declare usage rights. </strong></p>

<p><strong>The intention is not to only use CounterParty, Ethereum, and Namecoin, but any blockchain (or similar) fitting to the industry as the utilities become available. Visual art is currently only accepted if it has been approved in another collection. Original content in the form of text based content is invited to be registered in the poem/ namespace in Namecoin to be included in a truly decentralized digital &lsquo;zine. </strong></p>

<p><strong>Attendees at rare.af (Rare Arts Festival) in January 2018 were invited to contribute to an exquisite corpse of great length. This collective illustration was the first physical submission to the collection. It </strong></p>

<p><strong>is scheduled to return to the second blockchain art conference in NYC of the same name later this year, but first it will be made available at the DecentralizedWeb Science Fair 2018. Illustrators will be encouraged to &ldquo;tokenize&rdquo; their addition on their own or in cooperation of the attending volunteer. Content creators who are better with words than pictures will be invited or assisted in registering their own entries on the spot as well. Participants at the science fair will retain all of their issuance in the process if funded individually otherwise it will be delivered within 24 hours. </strong></p>

<p><strong>Those who follow through until the end of the process will have a unique memento of their contribution to this work of art which can be shared, traded or sold on the open market using CounterParty. Tapping into such a resource as the universal applicability of these tokens will secure the ability to use these novelty tokens well into the future.</strong></p>

          <div><p><strong>Urbit is a secure peer-to-peer network of personal servers, built on a clean-slate system software stack.</strong></p>

<p><strong>A personal server is a virtual computer which stores your data, runs your apps, and manages your connected devices. We believe controlling your own data, code and identity is the definition of digital freedom. We believe everyone needs digital freedom, not just a few hackers. We believe the only tool needed to solve this problem is a general-purpose server made for human beings. Your urbit is your cryptographic identity, personal archive, application platform, and device hub. It&#39;s as easy to manage as an iPhone.</strong></p>

<p><strong>In Urbit, network identities are cryptographic property, like Bitcoin. If Bitcoin is money and Ethereum is law, Urbit is land. Urbit is designed to become a digital republic: a network of individually owned nodes with no central point of control. Like a well-planned city, the friendly network is decentralized but connected, safe but free.</strong></p>

<p><strong>An ordinary person can&#39;t manage a Unix server on the Internet. The Unix-Internet platform was a brilliant system, but it&#39;s almost 50 years old. Urbit is a new clean-slate, full-stack server. It&#39;s implemented on top of the old platform, but it&#39;s a sealed sandbox like the browser.</strong></p></div>

          <div><p>Web3 is a new kind of web, and today is a decentralised movement, envisioned and further developed by Dr. Gavin Wood in 2014. It is &ldquo;a reimagination of the sorts of things that we already use the Web for, but with a fundamentally different model for the interactions between parties.&rdquo; (<a href="http://gavwood.com/web3lt.html">http://gavwood.com/web3lt.html</a>). We call this the &ldquo;more truth, less trust&rdquo; model.</p>

<p>The Web3 Foundation was founded by Dr. Gavin Wood, Co-Founder of Ethereum and Founder of Parity Technologies, as a non-profit organization that focuses on the development, deployment and maintenance of &ldquo;Web3&rdquo;, promoting the development of innovative technologies and applications in the field of cryptographically-enabled decentralised software protocols.</p>

<p>The Web3 Foundation developed a framework to visually display the Web3 technology stack and to lay out the different protocols comprising Web3. This forms the base upon which the decentralised applications of the future will be built. The Web3 tech stack is used as a roadmap for teams to coordinate efforts and push development forward collaboratively (Web3 tech stack: <a href="https://twitter.com/web3foundation/status/1006218412069150720">https://twitter.com/web3foundation/status/1006218412069150720</a>).</p>

<p>The Web3 Foundation nurtures and stewards cutting-edge technologies and applications at all levels of the Web3 tech stack. Our focus is on the research, development, deployment, funding, and maintenance of Web3 technologies, plus advocacy and education, developer-adoption, support of middleware, and base-layer/demonstration applications. Because of our experience building major components of the Web3 tech stack and their respective communities, we are uniquely positioned to assemble and align the diverse set of teams building the protocols that make up the Web3 tech stack.</p></div>

          <div><p><strong>What is WebTorrent?<br />
<br />
WebTorrent is the first torrent client that works in the browser. YEP, THAT&#39;S RIGHT. THE BROWSER.<br />
<br />
It&#39;s written completely in JavaScript &ndash; the language of the web &ndash; and uses WebRTC for true peer-to-peer transport. No browser plugin, extension, or installation is required.<br />
<br />
Using open web standards, WebTorrent connects website users together to form a distributed, decentralized browser-to-browser network for efficient file transfer.<br />
<br />
Why is this cool?<br />
<br />
Imagine a video site like YouTube, where visitors help to host the site&#39;s content. The more people that use a WebTorrent-powered website, the faster and more resilient it becomes.<br />
<br />
Browser-to-browser communication cuts out the middle-man and lets people communicate on their own terms. No more client/server &ndash; just a network of peers, all equal. WebTorrent is the first step in the journey to redecentralize the Web.</strong></p></div>
