	<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>

	<ol>
		<li>
		<p><strong>The Decentralized Web Summit is an event that brings together a community of professionals from around the world who use, develop, design, and support technology in the decentralized web. It is a space inclusive of persons of all backgrounds, orientations and identities. Dialogue, mutual respect and sharing are at the foundation of the decentralized web community and we expect all participants to follow these values. These guidelines help us establish collective trust and engage in productive deliberation.</strong></p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p><strong>Your safety and comfort are our priority. If you have a query or any concerns at any point before, during or after the conference, contact us at <a href="mailto:ethics@archive.org">ethics@archive.org</a>, <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1pJ8I4JilEB4YmjG0bcm8V5UgaZ14JOq3XbRsenOg3lU/viewform?ts=5b5faf16&amp;edit_requested=true">fill out this form</a> or call/text 415-570-8715.</strong></p>
		</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Expected Behavior</strong></p>

	<ol>
		<li>
		<p><strong>Respect</strong></p>

		<ol>
			<li>
			<p><strong>All participants and event staff should strive to treat each other with dignity and respect, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, and religion.</strong></p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p><strong>Respect the privacy&ndash;both physical and digital&ndash;of others. </strong></p>

			<ol>
				<li>
				<p><strong>If you want to take a picture, make sure you have consent from the participants. Wearing a yellow lanyard signifies people who have asked not to be photographed.</strong></p>
				</li>
				<li>
				<p><strong>Follow the <a href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/chatham-house-rule">Chatham House Rule</a> when mentioned.</strong></p>
				</li>
			</ol>
			</li>
		</ol>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p><strong>Collaborate</strong></p>

		<ol>
			<li>
			<p><strong>Be open to new ideas and learning from others&ndash;we are stronger when we share.</strong></p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p><strong>In moments of strong disagreement, we ask participants to &quot;agree to disagree,&quot; stay focused on the goals of the session or discussion, and move on to address shared needs and shared opportunities.</strong></p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p><strong>We encourage all present to make it a point where possible to talk to strangers and those you know less well, as they are hopefully friends you have not yet met.</strong></p>
			</li>
		</ol>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p><strong>Include</strong></p>

		<ol>
			<li>
			<p><strong>Everyone at the Decentralized Web Summit should feel included and it is to everyone&rsquo;s advantage to be mindful and productively engaged with people from a variety of cultural contexts, communities and regions.</strong></p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p><strong>When in doubt, mingle! We all have different perspectives that can help each other in worthwhile and unexpected ways.</strong></p>

			<ol>
				<li>
				<p><strong>In this spirit, avoid jargon, acronyms and complicated phrasing whenever possible.</strong></p>
				</li>
			</ol>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p><strong>Follow the &quot;Rule of 1&quot; and the &quot;Rule of n&quot;: When you speak, make 1 point and then let others speak, and when in a group of &quot;n&quot; people, speak &quot;1/nth&quot; of the time.</strong></p>
			</li>
		</ol>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p><strong>Communication</strong></p>

		<ol>
			<li>
			<p><strong>When listening to input and comments of others, start by assuming the most benign interpretation and the best intention of the speaker. If comment is phased in a way that might be misinterpreted, ask for clarification of the statement or intent. If the comment is discomforting (or hostile), please reach out to an event organizer.</strong></p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p><strong>Whether in panels or in informal conversation, be mindful not to interrupt others. Listen actively and others will return in kind.</strong></p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p><strong>Avoid grandstanding whenever possible and allow others to participate. The more concise and relatable your point is, the greater impact it will have on other participants.</strong></p>
			</li>
		</ol>
		</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Unacceptable Behavior</strong></p>

	<ol>
		<li>
		<p><strong>We will not tolerate predatory behavior and continued disregard for other persons, either personally or professionally, from and towards anyone&mdash;be it speakers, staff or participants.</strong></p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p><strong>We will not tolerate harassment in any form. </strong></p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p><strong>If you are being harassed, you notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact an event organizer on this page or use prudence and attempt to mitigate the action yourself. Do not resort to non-defensive physical contact. </strong></p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p><strong>Those who violate our code of conduct may be warned, sanctioned, or expelled at the discretion of the organizers with no refund.</strong></p>
		</li>

          <div class="modal-subtitle">founding engineer and system architect, Internet Archive</div>
          <div><p>Tracey Jaquith is a founding engineer and system architect for Internet Archive since 1996, writing multi-threaded servers, crawlers, and more. She wrote the &ldquo;what&rsquo;s related&rdquo; services that ultimately led to Alexa Internet&rsquo;s acquisition by Amazon. An inventor with two patents, she is the Archive&rsquo;s longest tenured employee after founder, Brewster Kahle.</p>

<p>In 2000, Jaquith left for four years to be the technical lead and founding engineer at a financial startup focusing on more efficiently trading convertible bonds.</p>

<p>Recently, Jaquith rewrote Internet Archive&rsquo;s TV recording system as an open source single server system, capable of preserving 75 simultaneous 24&times;7 channels, and developed the Television Archive&rsquo;s &ldquo;full stack&rdquo; first and second versions. For more than a decade, Jaquith held primary responsibility for archive.org and its full stack infrastructure, later launching a fully responsive &ldquo;Version 2&rdquo; of the archive.org website &mdash;migrating to jQuery, bootstrap, LESS, modern faceting, ElasticSearch, postgreSQL and more. She is leading the core infrastructure migration to Docker for archive.org&rsquo;s in-house AWS and S3-like system. Open Libraries services will rest upon the infrastructure Jaquith is designing.</p>

<p>Jaquith&rsquo;s first job was at Xerox PARC, writing core low-level C-language image processing and comparison algorithms using novel computational geometry based on research from her Master&rsquo;s degree.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Jaquith holds a Master&rsquo;s and Bachelor&rsquo;s in Computer Science from Cornell University where she focused on machine vision, robotics and mathematics. Jaquith presents at conferences (Demuxed 2016, MozFest) and is a regular guest lecturer at colleges about news and broadcast technologies.</p></div>

From 2006-2008, Rossi managed the audio and video collections and Open Library, as well as working on the Open Content Alliance, and the Zotero/IA project. From 2009-2015 Rossi managed internal web crawling projects and the Wayback Machine.</p>

<p>Rossi has been working with Internet content since 1996 when she discovered that being picky about words in books was good training for being picky about data on computers. She spent several years managing news content at ClariNet (the first online news aggregator), worked as the Editorial Director at Alexa Internet, and as Product Manager at Mixercast.</p>

<p>Rossi has an Masters of Library and Information Science, concentrating on web technologies and interfaces, and enjoys making jewelry, dancing, and baking Cookie Smackdown-winning cookies.</p></div>

          <div class="modal-subtitle">Director of Engineering, Internet Archive</div>
          <div><p>John Gonzalez has been at Internet Archive for three years working to support, coach, and lead the technology and operation teams at the heart of Internet Archive service delivery. His role has allowed him to apply over 30 years of experience in business and technology management to the Internet Archive mission of Universal Access to All Knowledge.<br />
<br />
Immediately prior to his position at Internet Archive, Gonzalez directed product strategy and development for multiple content management offerings. From 2005 to 2014 he was Director of Content Management Products at Xerox where he managed a $22 million product line of document management products. From 2001 to 2005 he was VP of Product Management and Strategy for Clearstory Systems (WebWare Digital Asset Management software). In the late 1990&rsquo;s Gonzalez was part of the Getty Images Corporate Business Development team as VP of Business Development where he participated in the acquisition and integration of multiple digital stock photography companies and negotiated business partnerships with Adobe, Lycos, AltaVista, and other iconic early-internet organizations.<br />
<br />
Gonzalez has consistently demonstrated passion for improving access and opportunity for youth in underserved populations. Throughout his professional career, he has volunteered time tutoring and mentoring students from families of color and contributing skills and resources to organizations focused on advancing the availability and quality of education for underserved youth. This commitment was redoubled when Gonzalez&rsquo;s oldest child, Raphael, was diagnosed with dyslexia.<br />
<br />
Starting in 2009, Gonzalez served on the Board of Directors for the San Francisco Children&rsquo;s Creativity Museum, including two years as Chairman and two years as Treasurer. The Children&rsquo;s Creativity Museum provides youth (ages 2-12) with experiences and programs designed to expand creative literacy and design thinking. During his six-year tenure, Gonzalez worked with and then led the CCM board to expand patron demographics and to stabilize financial and organizational scaffolding. Located in the heart of low-income neighborhoods of San Francisco, CCM continues to provide highly engaging and educational experiences for youth of all backgrounds and demographics.<br />
<br />
In May 2017, Gonzalez joined the board of the Buck Institute for Education (BIE), an organization whose highest priority is to help teachers prepare K-12 students for successful lives. The strategic focus of BIE is to enhance educational outcomes for all students, but especially for those in the US who are furthest from opportunity and resources.<br />
<br />
He earned a BS in Computer Science with honors from MIT and a MBA from Stanford Graduate School of Business.</p></div>
