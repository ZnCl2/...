In 1989, Kahle created the Internet&#39;s first publishing system called Wide Area Information Server (WAIS), later selling the company to AOL. In 1996, Kahle co-founded Alexa Internet, which helps catalog the Web, selling it to Amazon.com in 1999. The Internet Archive, which he founded in 1996, now preserves 38 petabytes of data - the books, Web pages, music, television, and software that form&nbsp;our cultural heritage, working with more than 1000 library and university partners to create a digital library, accessible to all.</p>

<p>Emily Jacobi has dedicated her life to using media and technology to amplify marginalized communities. The founder and executive director of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.digital-democracy.org/team/emily" target="_blank">Digital Democracy</a>&nbsp;(Dd), she works to decolonize technology by centering the voices and experiences of indigenous communities, people of color and women. Since 2013, Dd has worked closely with indigenous peoples in the Amazon Rainforest to build technology for mapping and monitoring environmental threats in remote offline environments. Dd pioneers new technology which its partners use to map millions of acres of rainforest, monitor oil spills and illegal mining activities, and lobby governments to respect land rights and increase environmental protections. Emily began her career as a youth journalist at the age of thirteen, and learned early on that the people most affected by a problem are the ones with the expertise to solve it. She has led technology, media and research projects in Latin America, West Africa, Southeast Asia and the United States.</p></div>

          <div class="modal-subtitle">Surveillance and Cybersecurity Counsel, American Civil Liberties Union</div>
          <div><p>Jennifer Granick&nbsp;fights for civil liberties in an age of massive surveillance and powerful digital technology. As the surveillance and cybersecurity counsel with the ACLU Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project, she litigates, speaks, and writes about privacy, security, technology, and constitutional rights. Granick is the author of the book&nbsp;<em>American Spies: Modern Surveillance, Why You Should Care, and What To Do About It</em>, published by Cambridge Press and winner of the 2016 Palmer Civil Liberties Prize.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Granick spent much of her career helping create Stanford Law School&rsquo;s Center for Internet and Society. From 2001 to 2007, she was executive director of CIS and founded the Cyberlaw Clinic, where she supervised students in working on some of the most important cyberlaw cases that took place during her tenure. For example, she was the primary crafter of a 2006 exception to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act that allows mobile telephone owners to legally circumvent the firmware locking their device to a single carrier. From 2012 to 2017, Granick was civil liberties director specializing in and teaching surveillance law, cybersecurity, encryption policy, and the Fourth Amendment. In that capacity, she has published widely on U.S. government surveillance practices&nbsp;and helped educate judges and congressional staffers on these issues. Granick also served as the civil liberties director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation from 2007&nbsp;to 2010.</p>

<p>Earlier in her career, Granick spent almost a decade practicing criminal defense law in California. Granick&rsquo;s work is well-known in privacy and security circles. Her keynote, &ldquo;Lifecycle of the Revolution&rdquo; for the 2015 Black Hat USA security conference electrified and depressed the audience in equal measure. In March of 2016, she received Duo Security&rsquo;s Women in Security Academic Award for her expertise in the field as well as her direction and guidance for young women in the security industry. Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) has called Granick an &ldquo;NBA all-star of surveillance law.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p><strong>Policies and practices about control of patient health records is a growing issue for clinical, research, and economic reasons. It directly impacts the work of HHS to implement the interoperability mandates of the 21st Century CURES Act, the work of NIH to implement the All of US research initiative, the CMS API into the Medicare records, and the VA systems APIs with private-sector EHRs and health information exchanges.

She has led a series of projects investigating analytical work practices and collaborative hypertext, including two system development projects, Aquanet and VIKI.

From her early experiences with hypertext, Marshall discovered the negative effects of having analysts work with formal representation. Marshall learned that information which does not fit in formal representation gets lost as people try to force it into this area.<br />
<br />
Cathy has a 20-year history working with hypertext. She worked at Xerox PARC for 11 years and Fuji Xerox Palo Alto Lab for one year. Between 1993 and 1996, while working with PARC, Judy Malloy and Cathy Marshall collaborated on&nbsp;<em>Forward Anywhere: Notes on an Exchange between Intersecting Lives</em>, a hypernarrative work based on electronic communication that passed between the two in which they sought &quot;to exchange the remembered and day-to-day substance of our lives&quot;. In the essay, &quot;Closure was never a goal in this piece,&quot; the two, (Judy Malloy and Cathy Marshall) share their experiences and thoughts about collaborating in &quot;Forward Anywhere,&quot; excerpts of which can be found in the site itself. She has also produced works such as &quot;Do Tags Work?&quot; which is a narrative on the effectiveness of archive tagging on the internet.</p></div>

          <div><p>A constant student. I love learning new languages, frameworks, databases and techniques. I try to have a wide breadth of knowledge on the subjects so I can select the best tool for the task at hand.

As such, I feel confident going into any environment with the assumption that I can become proficient in it.</p>

<p>I love development. I&#39;m passionate about it. I love design. I love the open web. When not in front of the keyboard, you can find me out in the sun rock climbing, skiing, or simply running. I also enjoy art, movies, the occasional video game, and traveling.</p></div>

          <div><p><strong>Duncan is an artist from Kalamazoo, Michigan who has recently traveled to NYC and Tokyo to meet with other cryptoartists in real life. After selling a tokenized print of an illustrated parody on stage at the actual first auction of visual art made for the blockchain, he became inspired to found artMuseum.io to be the world&#39;s first decentralized open-submission museum of cryptoart for any blockchain. </strong></p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a direct result of being empowered by publishing in someone else&rsquo;s system, this independent artist felt compelled to forge a collection of his own which is not as exclusive in theme but aims to reflect best practices in greater indologies of decentralization and consensus. Growing from the understanding for the root word of token being &ldquo;to teach,&rdquo; this telegram user assists artists all over the globe to participate in other the various community based cryptoart &ldquo;games&rdquo; which have launched in 2018. </strong></p>

<p><strong>Having accrued enough reputation and body of knowledge from all the odd jobs which made this outlier specialized he was selected by EverdreamSoft to curate the Memorychain and OasisMining collections in Book of Orbs. He began with updating the two Japanese whitepapers into one solid plan, drawing an action plan together with other compatible projects.</strong></p>

<p><strong>As a curator this visionary has launched a word of mouth only cryptoarto collection whose mechanisms push the boundaries of experience by inverting most of the rules. As a student in Marketing at Western Governors University this entrepreneur learned that a successful endeavor is based on giving the market the service it needs. Contrary to all the tokenized games to be announced since mid-2017, his &ldquo;Proof of Parody&rdquo; offers a novel upgrade to the joystick battle genre.</strong></p></div>

          <div class="modal-subtitle">Policy Counsel, Internet Archive</div>
          <div><p>Lila Bailey is Policy Counsel for the Internet Archive where she advises on the complex legal and policy issues associated with democratizing access to knowledge. She is also a lecturer at Berkeley Law, most recently teaching a course in the Fundamentals of Internet Law.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Prior to becoming the Internet Archive&rsquo;s in-house counsel, Bailey was the founder and principal attorney at The Law Office of Lila Bailey, specializing in digital copyright and privacy issues for individual entrepreneurs and creators, early stage startups, Internet platforms, and libraries. From 2011-2013, Bailey was a Clinical Teaching Fellow at Berkeley&rsquo;s Samuelson Law, Technology &amp; Public Policy Clinic, where she managed and mentored student attorneys as they tackled cutting edge work in public interest technology law and policy. Bailey&rsquo;s work there included advising a Civil Rights group on the copyright issues involved in making historical materials available in digital form, working on privacy issues associated with California&rsquo;s &ldquo;smart&rdquo; electricity grid, and drafted a white paper on the benefits of flexible copyright exceptions and limitations for libraries outside the U.S.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Prior to this, Bailey was counsel for Creative Commons, a nonprofit organization offering open copyright licenses that allow the sharing of creative works under flexible licensing terms. In this capacity, Bailey worked with the Open Educational Resources community, to make high-quality educational materials freely available under terms that allow anyone, anywhere, to access, customize, and share those resources via the Internet. Bailey held an Intellectual Property Fellowship with the Electronic Frontier Foundation in 2007, helping Internet users push back against abusive DMCA takedown notices and supporting EFF staff on the early stages of the Lenz v. Universal Music Group case (a.k.a. &ldquo;the Dancing Baby case&rdquo;). Bailey served as an associate at Perkins Coie, where she worked on copyright, patent, and trademark litigation. In 2006, she won the firm-wide Pro Bono Leadership Award for billing over 600 pro bono hours for the Internet Archive.</p>

<p>Bailey is a frequent speaker on digital copyright issues nationwide. She received her JD from Berkeley Law and her bachelor&rsquo;s degree in Philosophy from Brown University.</p></div>

          <div class="modal-subtitle">Founder, NetsEdge LLC</div>
          <div><p>Richard Whitt recently departed Google after eleven years, to resuscitate his tech consulting practice, NetsEdge LLC. &nbsp;His firm focuses on advising tech companies, law firms, and other clients on the complex strategic and tactical challenges at the intersection of emerging platform technologies, market dynamics, and corporate and public policies.</p>

<p>For his last four years with Google, Richard served as Corporate Director for Strategic Initiatives at the Mountain View headquarters. &nbsp;In that capacity, he worked with a number of different groups within the Company to develop and implement corporate policy. &nbsp;Most recently, he assisted Vint Cerf and Hal Varian on projects concerning IoT governance, machine learning ethics, digital preservation, and rural broadband deployment. &nbsp;Richard also guided the Google Access team&rsquo;s approach to working with governmental bodies and international organizations to deploy broadband infrastructure globally, particularly in Cuba and other emerging market countries.</p>

<p>From mid-2012 to mid-2014, Richard was vice president for global public policy and government relations with Motorola Mobility, a Google company. Prior to joining Motorola, Richard served as Google&rsquo;s director and managing counsel for federal policy, overseeing strategic thinking on privacy, cybersecurity, intellectual property, Internet governance, free expression, and international trade. &nbsp;In his first five years with Google&rsquo;s DC office, Richard headed up the public policy team on telecommunications and media issues. Among other achievements in that role, he led Google&rsquo;s advocacy on open Internet, broadband deployment, and spectrum policy. Richard also guided the Company&rsquo;s participation in the 700 MHz spectrum auction, involvement in TV White Spaces spectrum allocations, and launch of Google Fiber.</p>

<p>Prior to joining Google in 2007, Richard founded and headed NetsEdge Consulting, a public policy consulting firm that provided legal analysis, regulatory strategy, and advocacy counsel to Web companies. &nbsp;From 1994 to 2006, Richard worked in the legal department at MCI Communications, where he most recently served as vice president for federal law and policy. Rick previously spent five years as an associate attorney in the online communications practices of two large Washington, D.C.-based law firms.</p>

<p>Rick is a 1988 graduate of Georgetown University Law Center, and a 1984 graduate of James Madison University. He currently resides in San Francisco, California.</p></div>

            <p>Code of Conduct Team</p>
            <p>John Gonzalez has been at Internet Archive for three years working to support, coach, and lead the technology and operation teams at the heart of Internet Archive service delivery. His role has allowed him to apply over 30 years of experience in business and technology management to the Internet Archive mission of Universal Access to All Knowledge.<br />
<br />
Immediately prior to his position at Internet Archive, Gonzalez directed product strategy and development for multiple content management offerings. From 2005 to 2014 he was Director of Content Management Products at Xerox where he managed a $22 million product line of document management products. From 2001 to 2005 he was VP of Product Management and Strategy for Clearstory Systems (WebWare Digital Asset Management software). In the late 1990&rsquo;s Gonzalez was part of the Getty Images Corporate Business Development team as VP of Business Development where he participated in the acquisition and integration of multiple digital stock photography companies and negotiated business partnerships with Adobe, Lycos, AltaVista, and other iconic early-internet organizations.<br />
<br />
Gonzalez has consistently demonstrated passion for improving access and opportunity for youth in underserved populations. Throughout his professional career, he has volunteered time tutoring and mentoring students from families of color and contributing skills and resources to organizations focused on advancing the availability and quality of education for underserved youth. This commitment was redoubled when Gonzalez&rsquo;s oldest child, Raphael, was diagnosed with dyslexia.<br />
<br />
Starting in 2009, Gonzalez served on the Board of Directors for the San Francisco Children&rsquo;s Creativity Museum, including two years as Chairman and two years as Treasurer. The Children&rsquo;s Creativity Museum provides youth (ages 2-12) with experiences and programs designed to expand creative literacy and design thinking. During his six-year tenure, Gonzalez worked with and then led the CCM board to expand patron demographics and to stabilize financial and organizational scaffolding. Located in the heart of low-income neighborhoods of San Francisco, CCM continues to provide highly engaging and educational experiences for youth of all backgrounds and demographics.<br />
<br />
In May 2017, Gonzalez joined the board of the Buck Institute for Education (BIE), an organization whose highest priority is to help teachers prepare K-12 students for successful lives. The strategic focus of BIE is to enhance educational outcomes for all students, but especially for those in the US who are furthest from opportunity and resources.<br />
<br />
He earned a BS in Computer Science with honors from MIT and a MBA from Stanford Graduate School of Business.</p>

            <p>Code of Conduct Team</p>
            <p>Tracey Jaquith is a founding engineer and system architect for Internet Archive since 1996, writing multi-threaded servers, crawlers, and more. She wrote the &ldquo;what&rsquo;s related&rdquo; services that ultimately led to Alexa Internet&rsquo;s acquisition by Amazon. An inventor with two patents, she is the Archive&rsquo;s longest tenured employee after founder, Brewster Kahle.</p>

<p>In 2000, Jaquith left for four years to be the technical lead and founding engineer at a financial startup focusing on more efficiently trading convertible bonds.</p>

<p>Recently, Jaquith rewrote Internet Archive&rsquo;s TV recording system as an open source single server system, capable of preserving 75 simultaneous 24&times;7 channels, and developed the Television Archive&rsquo;s &ldquo;full stack&rdquo; first and second versions. For more than a decade, Jaquith held primary responsibility for archive.org and its full stack infrastructure, later launching a fully responsive &ldquo;Version 2&rdquo; of the archive.org website &mdash;migrating to jQuery, bootstrap, LESS, modern faceting, ElasticSearch, postgreSQL and more. She is leading the core infrastructure migration to Docker for archive.org&rsquo;s in-house AWS and S3-like system. Open Libraries services will rest upon the infrastructure Jaquith is designing.</p>

<p>Jaquith&rsquo;s first job was at Xerox PARC, writing core low-level C-language image processing and comparison algorithms using novel computational geometry based on research from her Master&rsquo;s degree.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Jaquith holds a Master&rsquo;s and Bachelor&rsquo;s in Computer Science from Cornell University where she focused on machine vision, robotics and mathematics. Jaquith presents at conferences (Demuxed 2016, MozFest) and is a regular guest lecturer at colleges about news and broadcast technologies.</p>
