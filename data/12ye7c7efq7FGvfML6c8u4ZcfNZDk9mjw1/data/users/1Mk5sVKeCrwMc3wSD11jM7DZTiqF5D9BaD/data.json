				"body": "They've always done this kind of thing. I've read that back in Windows XP I believe it was, the defragmentation app phoned home. A defragmentation app has no reason to connect to the internet at all. Use Linux, BSD, OS X, but better to stay away from Windows unless you are a gamer or required to use it for work.\n\nIf you do have to use it or just really like it, there is now a tool that removes all of the Microsoft spy tools from Windows 10. I haven't used it since I don't use Windows, so I'd read up on it to make sure if it's the real deal and not some hacker trying to infect your PC with a trojan profiting from the fear of Windows 10. And that fear is real. At some conference they had a sign saying \"If you leave your laptop unattended we will upgrade it to Windows 10\" :)",
