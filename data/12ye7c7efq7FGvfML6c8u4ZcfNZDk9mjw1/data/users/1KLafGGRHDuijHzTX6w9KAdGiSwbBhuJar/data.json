On the other hand, if they want fully copyrights then, I'd gladly pay for it. Right now, it also seems like technology has raced ahead of copyright laws especially since I.P. law works more in favor of larger corporations than every day people. In the future, I just hope there's more of a balance between free and payed content even though I'd rather live in a fully open sourced world over the long term.",
