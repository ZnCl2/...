I do not know if Chromium(the open source version of Google Chrome) spies at the user. Maybe it is also a \"good\" browser. But I can only advise you against Google Chrome. Especially if you do not want to deal with DRM or trackers.\n\nI use the following addons in my Waterfox:\n-> NoScript (THE MOST IMPORTANT)\n-> Random Agent Spoofer\n-> uBlock Origin\n-> Self-Destructing Cookies (less important)\n\nAnd always remember kidz: The fewer addons, the better!",
