			"title": "NZ Republic vs. NZ Democracy",
			"body": "**[Facts]** \nSimply put - the key difference between a democracy and a republic lies in the limits placed on government by the law, which has implications for minority rights. Both forms of government tend to use a representational system â€” i.e., citizens vote to elect politicians to represent their interests and form the government. \n&nbsp;\n**In a republic, a constitution or charter of rights protects certain inalienable rights that cannot be taken away by the government, even if it has been elected by a majority of voters**. \n&nbsp;\n**In a \"pure democracy,\" the majority is not restrained in this way and can impose its will on the minority.**\n&nbsp;\nMost modern nations are democratic republics with a constitution, which can be amended by a popularly elected government. This comparison therefore contrasts the form of government in most countries today with a theoretical construct of a \"pure democracy\", mainly to highlight the features of a republic.\n&nbsp;\n**[Opinion]**\nThe New Zealand Republican Party would guarantee the following constitutional rights:\n- A no-strings-attached, weekly Universal Basic Income of $300 paid to every New Zealand Citizen or Permanent Resident.\n- The right to the personal use of recreational substances without legal consequences (drug decriminalisation).\n- The right to free speech, and the right to have one's voice heard on online platforms.\n- The protection of private property.\n- The abolition of most forms of copyright law.\n- The abolition of punitive and unnecessary taxes i.e. Tobacco tax, plastic bag tax, fuel tax, imports tariffs, etc.\n- The introduction of higher taxes on wealthy individuals and corporations, while reducing taxes for low earners.\n- The right to online privacy.\n- More to come.",

			"body": "**[Discussion]**\n&nbsp;\n**[Opinion]**\nWe should replace Work and Income & all benefits with a Universal Basic Income, so as to guarantee the abolition of poverty in this country, and the flexibility of work and the economy as a whole.\n&nbsp;\nUnlike the UBI, WINZ encourages idleness by cutting off vital payments to people who are struggling financially even after finding work. This also has the effect of worsening nationwide mental health, as well as increasing stress levels.\n&nbsp;\nThere will always be people who refuse work. Then again, the only solution to this problem is to make work attractive, not use it as a form of punishment. There are many other reasons people choose to work, including social, moral and cultural values.\n&nbsp;\nIt's time for 21st century politics!",

We fed up with immigrants and muslims..\n\nWe also need to encourage muslim people to improve their own countries through peaceful revolution ... rather than moving to another country and thinking that their problems will go away. We can only take so many people at once.\n&nbsp;\nThe exception to this rule would obviously be refugees who really are in danger, and are fleeing warzones.\n&nbsp;\n..Then again -> The reason we have a refugee crisis to begin with ... is because we stuck our noses in the wrong places where they didn't belong.
