			"body": "Last week, I introduced ZeroNet in a local Linux User Group and the main question was : *Why use a such software if we can have access to other tools more popular ?*\n\nIt's important to answer this question.\n\nDue to its architecture, ZeroNet is always accessible, does not require server and is uncensored. These features seem simply technical but, in fact, they give a fabulous tools to people living in censored countries.\n\nZeroNet, with Tor, preserve anonymity and so free expression to people who need it. I don't think it's my case (today anyway) but I'm proud to witness what is happening elsewhere on earth.\n\nI am eager to grab many ZeroBlog addresses from all around the world !"
