			"body": "i heard or read that by watching violence (in TV news) people getting less sensitive to it (which is not good), though as mentioned here, if one see the violence, it can help him to do the changes in their life. i do not know whether it is good to see violence. In my case i think i do not need to see it, because i think i already know how evil the world/people can be (because i listen what people did during war, etc..), unsure if is better to watch it and feel bad/bad mood or not watch it and loose opportunity to remind me that we are sinners who repeating our mistakes as long as we are allowed.",
