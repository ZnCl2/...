      <div class="description">The Internet Archive has started the process of preserving the WWW but there is an opportunity to refine the design of WWW to create a self-archiving, distributed system. I hope to explore some of the desirable properties of such a self-archiving system from the technical perspective but feel compelled to consider business models that make the process sustainable and affordable. This is clearly more than just a technical problem.</div>

      <div class="description">20 years after the World Wide Web was created, can we now make it better?  How can we ensure that our most important values: privacy, free speech, and open access to knowledge are enshrined in the code itself?  In a provocative call to action, entrepreneur and Open Internet advocate, Brewster Kahle, challenges us to build a better, decentralized Web based on new distributed technologies. He lays out a path to creating a new Web that is reliable, private, but still fun—in order to lock the Web open for good.</div>

There are many stakeholders being damaged in the process, from individuals to entire nations.  To lock open the Web we will need more than code. We will need binding agreements and covenants that enshrine our deepest values. Cory Doctorow shares his vision of what went wrong and how we can get it right – through governance and policies – in the decentralized Web to come.

      <div class="description">There are many "Black Hats" on the world stage today.  They have enormous resources, little government oversight, and taps into all the major fiber links.  Their goal: to break the security of your code.  How can the decentralized technologies represented here fend off their attacks?  How would you work around the "Great Firewall of China?"  How are you employing this "Black Hat" understanding into your design?  We'll pose some provocative security scenarios and discuss how decentralized technologies can combat the most powerful purveyors of censorship, surveillance, and piracy on the world stage.  How can builders of a new Web share scenario planning and knowledge to succeed?

  <div class="schedule-intro">
    On June 9th, the day after the Decentralized Web Summit, we will be hosting a Decentralized Web meetup at the Internet Archive. This meetup is free and open to the public. We will have tables set up for people to meet and hack on decentralized web projects, and have lightning talks scheduled in the Great Room upstairs throughout the day. If you are interested in learning more about the decentralized web or working on related projects with your peers, this is the place to be! Snacks and drinks will be provided.

Interledger is heavily inspired by the designs of IP, TCP, etc so also come talk to us if you are interested in aspects of the Internet's design to emulate or avoid.

Tendermint is a ""blockchain engine"" that provides provable security for any blockchain.  Tendermint is used by ErisIndustries, tested in the R3 consortium, and is gaining adoption by many other upstarts.

Blockchain scalability is an active area of research in the cryptocurrency community.  The team behind Tendermint will reveal a novel blockchain network architecture that solves the blockchain scalability problem.

The lightning talk will quickly explain the problem and proposed architecture, and more discussion/Q&A will happen at the workshop session, hopefully with a big whiteboard.  A link to a whitepaper will be announced prior to the lightning talk, and copies will be available during the workshop.

See you there!

          <div>Jae Kwon is a blockchain software architect and cofounder of Tendermint. After graduating from Cornell in 2005 with a B.S. degree in computer science, he worked as a professional developer in Silicon Valley, including at Alexa, and at Yelp where he led the mobile application development team. He also cofounded iDoneThis, a productivity service. Jae has worked on numerous open-source projects, including a CoffeeScript compiler/interpreter written in Javascript, an end-to-end encrypted email system called <a href="https://scramble.io">Scramble.io</a>, and a cryptocurrency exchange.  These projects were inspired by the cryptopunk hacker ethos, which ultimately led to the current work with Tendermint. Jae has been working on a project he created in 2014, called Tendermint. He invented and refined the Tendermint consensus algorithm with the aim of liberating the blockchain from the costs and drawbacks of proof-of-work mining.  His mission is to make this technology more accessible, in order to accelerate the adoption of decentralized ledger technology.

The technology is currently in testing phases before launching an Alpha product and this workshop will go over features from a user experience perspective of logging into the network and uploading personal data, creating an entry in the native DNS system, uploading and publishing a website viewable in any browser. Additionally, this session will cover hosting a vault and touch on some of the key aspects of the infrastructure design which supports data security and user anonymity. If there's time/interest, we can also discuss third-party developer opportunities through the API and review some examples.

She received a BFA practicing experimental art with a strong focus on complexity in nature through interactive installations. Her understanding of natural decentralized systems would map rather eloquently to her growing interest in censorship resistant technologies as she started working for mesh networking startup Open Garden and organizing many bitcoin and cryptocurrency events in San Francisco. In early 2014, Paige met Scotland-based company, MaidSafe who are building a peer-to-peer Internet stemming from similar principles within natural systems which were so attractive to her many years prior and she has been working on various communication efforts full-time with MaidSafe since.

We will also discuss Orbit, a p2p chat webapp on top of ipfs, and Orbit-db, the CRDT based database it uses.

This workshop will go over:

- js-ipfs motivation and introduction
- js-ipfs demos
- Orbit: full P2P dynamic real-time chat on js-ipfs
- Orbit-db: CRDT based replicated log
- using js-ipfs to build completely distributed webapps
- full mesh conncetivity: js-ipfs meets go-ipfs

During the curation of the conference preparation we were already aware of the lack of gender and cultural diversity in the history of the Internet and technology as a whole. We took significant steps to facilitate viewpoints of underrepresented perspectives but it does not end with this conference. We have 25% female speakers during the Decentralised Web Summit but we strongly feel that we need to address this with more passion. In this workshop we like to claim the space for gender equality and ethnic diversity in building the future decentralised and open Internet. Our proposal is to start a working group on this topic during the conference but since we understand that this is the first event of a series of events we hope to establish a plan moving forward as well. There were similar discussions during Ouishare Fest in May with the consensus to create a task force that works on this. We would love to initiate an collaborative effort from actors across networks and communities, including <a href="http://get-d.net">get-d.net</a> <a href="http://blockchainworkshops.org">blockchainworkshops.org</a> <a href="http://ouishare.net">ouishare.net</a> etc.

Tendermint is a "blockchain engine" that provides provable security for any blockchain.  Tendermint is used by ErisIndustries, tested in the R3 consortium, and is gaining adoption by many other upstarts.

Blockchain scalability is an active area of research in the cryptocurrency community.  The team behind Tendermint will reveal a novel blockchain network architecture that solves the blockchain scalability problem.

The lightning talk will quickly explain the problem and proposed architecture, and more discussion/Q&A will happen at the workshop session, hopefully with a big whiteboard.  A link to a whitepaper will be announced prior to the lightning talk, and copies will be available during the workshop.

See you there!

          <div>Jae Kwon is a blockchain software architect and cofounder of Tendermint. After graduating from Cornell in 2005 with a B.S. degree in computer science, he worked as a professional developer in Silicon Valley, including at Alexa, and at Yelp where he led the mobile application development team. He also cofounded iDoneThis, a productivity service. Jae has worked on numerous open-source projects, including a CoffeeScript compiler/interpreter written in Javascript, an end-to-end encrypted email system called <a href="https://scramble.io">Scramble.io</a>, and a cryptocurrency exchange.  These projects were inspired by the cryptopunk hacker ethos, which ultimately led to the current work with Tendermint. Jae has been working on a project he created in 2014, called Tendermint. He invented and refined the Tendermint consensus algorithm with the aim of liberating the blockchain from the costs and drawbacks of proof-of-work mining.  His mission is to make this technology more accessible, in order to accelerate the adoption of decentralized ledger technology.

We will be showing off demos of Interledger in action, walking through how to build it into your projects and how to Interledger-enable your ledger, and discussing how it works under the hood.

Interledger is heavily inspired by the designs of IP, TCP, etc so also come talk to us if you are interested in aspects of the Internet's design to emulate or avoid.

IPFS was originally created to distribute and verison large scientific datasets. It is designed to make it easy to archive vast amounts of data. This is suitable for efforts like the Internet Archive, as well as many other systems out there. This talk will go over how to create IPFS Archives, existing efforts, Wayback IPFS (an implementation of Wayback Machine with IPFS), and more. It will also discuss Package Managers and the role IPFS can play to make them safer and better.

This workshop will cover:

- Archiving with IPFS
  - Wayback IPFS -- an implementation of a Wayback Machine on top of IPFS!
  - how to archive things with IPFS
  - how to replicate archives peer-to-peer
  - how to engage communities in shared archival efforts
- The IPFS Archives effort
  - Open Access Scientific Papers and Data
  - OpenStreetMap
- Package Managers and IPFS
  - discuss package management and IPFS generally
  - npm on ipfs
  - gx
  - others

This currency is backed by the time of its users voluntarily and exchanged among each other for goods and services. We provide the means for managing the flow of this currency between users automatically through smart contracts. In addition we provide a commodities market that tracks the price of goods in services traded on the network as financial decision making data for negotiating the price of goods and services. This lays the foundation for a sustainable universal basic income that not only encourages contribution to society but the funding of innovation either indirectly through currency or by direct human effort or contribution. The current non-linear, inflationary economies of the world cannot support this concept. This system monetizes charity as opposed to scarcity of resources.  It also meets  the criteria of being an Open Value Network. I'd love to share more information in person. The paper detailing the full system or our github wiki can be reached through our website.

        <div class="modal-bio">IPLD is the internal data format for IPFS, Mediachain, uPort, IPDB, and other systems. A large variety of protocols use merkle-linked datastructures (git, bittorrent, ipfs, tahoe-lafs, sfs, etc). IPLD is an interchangeable data format to unify these types of systems. It can represent any merkle-tree or hash-chain data, perfect for peer-to-peer protocols and decentralizing the web.

Our goal at the Summit is to increase the collaboration between all our p2p protocols. IPLD is a fantastic vector for collaboration!

This workshop will cover:

- IPLD Motivation and Intoduction
- IPLD Design
  - merkle-links: the core unit of a merkle-graph
  - merkle-paths: unix-style paths for traversing merkle-graphs with named merkle-links
  - IPLD Data Model: a flexible, JSON-based data model for representing merkle-dags.
  - IPLD Serializion: a set of formats in which IPLD objects can be represented, for example JSON, CBOR, CSON, YAML, Protobuf, XML, RDF, etc.
- Concrete IPLD Examples:
  - Filesystems
  - Version Control Systems
  - Blockchains
  - Indexing
  - Mapping
- How is IPLD used in IPFS and other systems

          <div>Greg currently works on search for the Wayback Machine, but caught the distributed computing bug while working on the Legion metacomputing system in the late 1990s. Formerly, he was founder/CTO of a web-scale search engine, which was sold to IBM Watson in 2015. Before that, he was founder/Distinguished Engineer at a supercomputing startup. For fun, he plays a bunch of Renaissance-era musical instruments, and taught himself Italian so that he could reconstruct the dances in 16th century Italian dance manuals.

1. Create interoperability among graph visualization interfaces.

2. Provide adaptors to connect these interfaces to personal data ecosystems, including browsing history, social network data, cloud storage, and ultimately, any public or private data.

3. Abstract data sources into semantically linked unified dashboards, facilitating the transition from traditional server & database systems toward secure, distributed public and private storage, as these systems become practical and performant.

As we resist corporate and state-driven efforts to partition the Internet into speech-restricting, surveillance-riddled enclaves, we must explore institutional alternatives to protect and cultivate the decentralized Web. A key component will be to bolster projects that empower people to share ownership and control their local Internet infrastructure, such as community broadband and mesh networks. Another, equally important aspect of this work is in creating more platforms—web services and apps—that are to some degree owned and controlled by their community of users, such as platform cooperatives.

This lightning talk will address how the challenges that the Web faces are questions of economic and institutional concentrations of power. That, in order to counteract the threat of centralization, it's critical that the institutions that comprise the decentralized web are themselves transparent, democratized, and are legally bound to protect the human rights of their users.

Many other projects have come together to collaborate on libp2p, as it solves difficult networking challenges for everyone, and creates interoperable protocols.

Our goal at the Decentralized Web Summit is to increase the collaboration between all these peer-to-peer, distributed protocols. libp2p is a fantastic vector for collaboration.

Come build a new p2p app with us!

This workshop will cover:

- libp2p motivation and introduction
- libp2p design and interfaces
  - transports
  - connectivity (NAT traversal, routing)
  - peer discovery
  - peer routing
  - content routing
  - content storage
  - pub / sub
  - consensus
- examples of libp2p modules
- examples of using libp2p to build p2p protocols
- discuss how libp2p is used by ipfs
