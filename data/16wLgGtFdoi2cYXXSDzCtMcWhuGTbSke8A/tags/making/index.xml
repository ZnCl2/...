      <description>After going through and working with zeronet for a while, I thought I would share the process for getting a site up and running without the standard, clone site. Hugo, similar to Jekyll, is a fairly good option for doing this kinds of site since they create static sites.
I originally went out looking for solutions to create new sites I kept running into the &amp;ldquo;Get Started Quickly&amp;rdquo; process provided by the clone site button.</description>
