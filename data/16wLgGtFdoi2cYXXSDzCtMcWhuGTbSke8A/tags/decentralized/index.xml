      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I&amp;rsquo;ve done any updating to the site so I thought that I would add a little extra life back into the workflow. Originally when I started using ZeroNet I was seeing that there were a lot of external connections to the outside world, especially with some of the sites that were replicating net sites. I am please to say that running and looking through all of the items that I was scanning today, I didn&amp;rsquo;t see a single connection that was traveling outside of zeronet.</description>

      <description>When you are working with decentralized content or really any content at all make sure that you always, always, always make a back up copy of the private key. Because it will come back to haunt you in the end if you dont. Luckly I remembered to make a back up and keep it in a really safe place, hidden behind a password so secure that I can&amp;rsquo;t seem to think of what it is to save me.</description>

      <description>So I ran a bit of an experiment, I was running zeronet is an offline mode and I noticed that there are some sites that are severly broken in a full offline state. For me it&amp;rsquo;s a matter of taking the train, but it&amp;rsquo;s important to note the opperation of a network of communications in the attempt of a full government shutdown, such as the one that was seen in Turkey in 2016.</description>
