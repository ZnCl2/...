<h2 id="reincarnation-locating-services">Reincarnation locating services</h2>

<p>A good introduction to the current state of the art of reincarnation locating 
services is covered in the documentary 
“<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1286798/">Unmistaken Child</a>”.</p>

<p>Essential to understanding how it works, is knowing about Ludic Fallacy, which
is propagated by some Nihlists, who claim that things happen at random, like the
rolling of dice in a game. That would be true if the things that happened were 
closed systems, but here on Earth, and indeed the galaxy cosmos we have an 
open-system where we affect each other, and things are inter-related.</p>

<ol>
  <li>The direction of the smoke at cremation time is used to see the general
direction in which someone may reincarnate.</li>
  <li>A channelled oracle may be consulted for some information.</li>
  <li>A form of divination can be used, to ascertain the probabilities of various
variables in relation to the reincarnation destination, including place and
parent names.</li>
  <li>Visions may occur to people close to the person that is to reincarnate, 
particularly when it is near the time of their reincarnation.</li>
  <li>Once it is determined that they have reincarnated and a rough age is
available a search ensues in the area where they are most likely to be.</li>
  <li>The children are tested by seeing if they are familiar with the clothing and
personal items of the former host body.</li>
  <li>Formal testing of the former host body objects from a variety of alternative
objects of the same type but different in appearance can take place where 
there is a high statistical probability of failure. And thus a high
confidence rating if they are successful.</li>
  <li>Additional testing may be viable with past life regression, to see if their
past life memories line up with those of the previous incarnation(s).</li>
</ol>

<p>While ideally we would have the co-operation of Tibetan Buddhism, as they have
much experience in this regard and take it quite seriously. If not it is
possible to do indpendantly.</p>

<p>I’ve already approached Zasep Tulku Rinpoche in regards to it, though he didn’t
seem particularly enthused by the idea. When there are enough people interested
in reincarnation locating services, I’m considering going over to Dharmasala and
asking the Dalai Lama for approval, and co-operation of some other people there.</p>

<h2 id="financial">Financial</h2>

<p>Obviously this would be one of the most expensive procedures, and as such would
likely initially only be available to the rich and those who have enough people
willing to volunteer and donate resources (such as Buddhist Rinpoches).</p>

<p>People going this method will still be encouraged to give 60\% of their 
inheritance  to their current bodies surviving relations to avoid envy problems.
The rest can go to a trust fund for their future incarnation, and to pay for the
service itself.</p>

<p>In the event that they don’t reincarnate on Earth or an accessible planet, there
should also be designated a charity or place or person the trust fund will go to
support.</p>

<h2 id="time-line">Time Line</h2>

<p>The time line for this is roughly a decade or so, considering that the Dalai
Lama is still in good health, there is no rush. If you are interested, email me
at streondj@gmail.com with REINCARNATION in the subject line, depending on
popularity I may start a mailing list, and-or social media group for developments.</p>
