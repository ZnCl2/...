<p>This blog post is a brief chapter summary, focusing on the main lesson learned.</p>

<p>Part I is about Winning the War Within</p>

<p>“Extreme Ownership” is similar to the concept of taking absolute responsibility
for your experience.</p>

<p>It creates a leader that when things goes bad takes all the blame, thus empowering 
themselves to be the source of change to avoid such mistakes in future.
When combined with Level 5 Leadership from good-to-great it
makes a leader that when times are good they pass on the credit to their
subordinates that did well and helped to make it happen.</p>

<p>“There are no bad teams, only bad leaders”, meaning that the team leader
transforms the team they are working with by helping them focus on the mission,
and believing that they can succeed.</p>

<p>“Believe” refers to that you have to have enough knowledge to understand the 
mission well enough to believe it and transfer that knowledge and 
understanding to your subordinates so that they also believe in the mission.
If you do not believe in the mission, then ask more questions, do more research
or find out more about why the mission is happening.</p>

<p>“Check the Ego” is about maintaining humility, and when faced with other peoples
hubris, particularly that of subordinates, come to them saying how it is your
fault, for example that you didn’t explain the consequences or the reasons for
certain orders.</p>

<p>Part II is about the “laws of combat”</p>

<p>“Cover and Move”, is about how all the teams in an organization have to work
together, and should not get caught up in the details of their own department,
realizing that they are not working against but with the other departments.  So
by having some lines of communications with upstream and downstream departments
can have better department cohesion.</p>

<p>“Simple” is about maintaining simplicity, and realizing that and overly complex
plan while it may theoretically be better, likely wont be put into practice, so
it is best to stick to something simple that everyone understands, also lowers
risk of broken telephone.</p>

<p>“Prioritize and Execute” is realizing that having too many work in progress
lowers throughput, so it is best to focus on a main priority fulfill then, then
move onto the next only after the first is going strong or has been completed.</p>

<p>“Decentralized Command” is about how having teams of 5-6 subordinates seems to
be most effective, and to let the workers own their work, and let the leaders
have a broader view so they can keep track of the strategy.</p>

<p>“Plan” is about the importance of planning and making sure that the people in
the field know why, how, what they are doing. Lean plans that show the big
picture and tell the workers how they fit in that big picture.</p>

<p>“Leading up and down the chain of command” is about how if you feel frustrated
by the demands of higher ups, think about how they are making these demands
because they want to understand and help. So take ownership of helping them
understand the why how what of your decisions in the field, to get the
permits/go-ahead for the projects that you are doing.</p>

<p>“Decisiveness amid uncertainty” is about how we are always operating with
incomplete information and that we have to make the best decisions that we can
given the information that we have, considering that some of it may change.
There are certain decisions that you can undo, and others that you can’t, so the
ones you can undo can be done more freely, but the ones that can’t should be
done with more caution.   Another lesson learned  in this chapter was that if
there are leaders squabling with other leaders in the same company, perhaps 
neither of them should lead, and someone with better co-operationg skills should
be promoted instead.</p>

<p>“Discipline equals freedom” is about how standardizing best practice can help
teams work more effectively and quickly, giving them more free time, and free
brain processing power.  Also gives more freedom when making modifications to
known procedures, can simply notify about the modification, rather than
reiterating the whole procedure.   However it is important to note that the
discipline is open to adaptation based on environment.</p>

<p>All in all it was a great piece of work. Bravo Jocko.</p>
