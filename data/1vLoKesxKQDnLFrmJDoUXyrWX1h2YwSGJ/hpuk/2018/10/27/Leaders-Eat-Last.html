My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2571668245">5 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
The most inspirational book on leadership that I’ve read thus far.<br />One of my main takeaways is that leaders have a social contract they have to upkeep with their people.<br /><br />He also talked about brain chemicals and how competitive environments make people more selfish dopamine junkies.<br />Wheras cooperative environments foster serotonin and oxytocin, allowing everyone to work together and prosper.<br /><br />Feeling unsafe and competitive also pumps cortisol and adrenaline which is unhealthy at chronic levels.<br />Wheras serotonin and oxytocin help improve lifespans.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />As leaders we have to foster an environment that promotes feelings of safety and cooperation in the company.<br /><br />He talked about how our Paleolithic roots are what make us work best in safe groups. And that contemporary obsession with stats often leads to bad decisions by dehumanizing the situation.<br /><br />He talked about the importance of culture in creating an atmosphere of cooperation and that the leader sets the tone for an organization. So even a great culture can be corrupted by bad leadership, and a competitive culture can be made good with cooperative leadership.<br /><br /><br /><br />He talked about the importance of interity AKA truthfulness and how it is essential to trust and being a good leader. Since trust is essential to followers feeling they can rely on their leader.<br />He also talked about the various generations (great, boomer, x, y) their strengths and weaknesses. Said important thing to watch out for millennials is realising that things take time, and that to get things accomplished we have to do more than raise awareness. We have to act and persist in cooperation.<br /><br /><br />He also talked about how teaching others cooperative leadership is key to maintaining your own. That legacy is the cooperative culture that allows a company to continue succeeding after you’ve left.<br /><br /><br /><br />That we’re in this together and together we make happy memories, the now and the future.

<p>A great book with easy to understand examples and counter measures.<br /><br /><br /><br />2 Reciprocation: The Old Give and Take…and Take<br /><br />People feel they need to give back for any gift they receive. Most memorable was how the Hare Krishna’s got rich handing out recycled flowers.<br /><br />Another important thing covered was giving concessions whether real or imaginary to motivate others to agree to buy. Best example was the Watergate burglary which was sold to the Republicans as by concession.<br /><br /><br />3 Commitment and Consistency: Hobgoblins of the Mind<br /><br />About how people tend to be consistent and the small choices they make change their internal self representation.<br /><br />Great example was that by getting PoW to agree that America is not perfect they put them on the road to writing pro communist anti american essays.<br /><br />4 Social Proof: Truths Are Us<br /><br />Otherwise known as the bandwagon effect it is how by making something seem popular can promote you to go along with it.<br /><br />Best example was how he had trouble getting his three year old to learn to swim, but then found him swimming quite well simply because he saw another three year old swimming. <br /><br /><br />5 Liking: The Friendly Thief<br /><br />This is about where sales people want to pretend to be similar to you in order to get you to like them and want to buy from them.<br /><br /><br />Best example was a car salesman that sent people postcards every month that said ‘I Like You’<br />6 Authority: Directed Deference<br /><br />This is about how people will stop making decisions when there is a higher authority.<br /><br />Best example was that high percentage of nurses went to administer a potentially lethal dose of a medication to a patient simply because someone over the phone claiming to be a doctor told them to.<br /><br /><br />7 Scarcity: The Rule of the Few<br /><br />This was about how a lack of something made it more desirable.<br /><br />Best example was how when the new freedoms Gorbachev gave people were threatened by a coup the people of the Soviet Union rose up and rioted so hard that after only three days the USSR fell.<br /><br /><br />Wow! Impressive book many lessons, I’ve even applied some in my life, like the consistency principle by publicizing my intent to be a virtuous Buddhist I’ve reached a new level of consistency.
