My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2554785503">5 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
This is a great time management book that has changed my life in the short time I’ve had it. <br />The main takeaways for me was to put less emphasis on todo lists and much more on having a calendar schedule. The quote that stuck with me most from here is scheduling your calendar in 15 minute increments will put you in 95th percentile of time organization. <br /><br />Otherwise I like to review my non fiction books by going through the table of contents. <br /><br />* The power of 1440<br /> there are 1440 minutes in a day, and every minute counts. <br /><br />* The Power of Proper Priorities<br />you gotta select one thing and stick to it<br /><br />* Stop making to-do lists – do this instead<br />schedule stuff on a calendar<br /><br />* the procrastination cure<br />bunch of anti-procrastination tips,<br />though for me the most powerful has been simply to schedule it,<br />cause then I do it. Though for others maybe this chapter would be helpful.<br /><br />* How to Leave the Office at 5:00 – Without Guilt<br />Basically schedule it. Instead of having todo list, have a schedule.<br />Then if you have overflow, hire people or outsource. <br /><br />* Richard Branson’s Secret Productivity Tool<br />a notebook. A paper notebook and pen, to write ideas when they happen.<br />Can also be used to take notes in meetings and such.<br /><br />* Master your email inbox with 321Zero<br />various tips for minimizing your inbox, and getting through all your emails within 21 minutes or less.<br />like unsubscribe from mailing lists, and use quick responses. <br /><br />* Meeting hacks from Google, Apple and Virgin.<br />Main takeaway for me was that standing meetings are more productive than sit down meetings, want to have as few people as possible, and if you can be walking or moving around during the meeting even better. I’ve since schedules a 15 minute daily huddle with my spouse, so we can talk about any issues that have come up in the day, and schedule things we’re interested in doing. <br /><br />* One Little Word that Multiplies Success<br />No. The idea is that saying yes means saying no to other things. <br />So better to keep that one thing or main goal in focus with everything,<br />and if this doesn’t benefit that, then say no. <br /><br />* The Powerful Paraeto Principle<br />the 80/20 rule. <br /><br />* The “3 Harvard Questions” That Save 8 Hours a Week<br />Drop, Delegate, Redesign. <br />What can I drop or stop doing?<br />What can I delegate or outsource?<br />What can I do in a more efficient way?<br /><br />Notably amongst the entrepreneur responses later in the book, <br />this was one of the most cited things. To delegate and hire people.<br />You get the idea, then set up a machine so other people can make it.<br /><br />* Why Twitter Co-Founder Jack Dorsey Themes His Days<br />A kind of meta-scheduling where each day of the week has a different focus.<br />Focus Days, Buffer Days (catch up), Free Days (weekends).<br />Monday Management Day, <br />Tuesday Product Day (focus day),<br />Wednesday Marketing PR Day (focus day),<br />Thursdays Developers and Partners (focus day).<br />Friday culture and recruiting (buffer day). <br />Saturday hiking day (Free day),<br />Sunday reflection day (Free day).<br /><br />* Don’t Touch! (Until You’re Ready)<br />promotes “touch it once” mentality, <br />idea being to finish any task that takes less than 5 minutes immediately,<br />rather than procrastinate, which would waste more time.<br /><br />* Change Your Morning, Change Your Life<br />Talks about the importance of having a good morning routine, <br />and that the most cognitively productive hours are in the morning. <br /><br />* Energy is Everything<br />Sleep enough, eat healthy, hydrate, meditate, and exercise. <br /><br />* The E-3C System: Putting It All Together<br />Energy, Capture, Calendar, Concentrate. <br />Energy: stay healthy.<br />Capture: write it in your notebook.<br />Calendar: schedule, main goals, theme days, say no to the irrelevant.<br />Concentrate: one task at a time, no notifications, schedule rest at least once an hour. <br /><br /><br />There is also all the quotes from those billionaires, olympians and entrepreneurs. a quiz and some other extras. well worth the money.
