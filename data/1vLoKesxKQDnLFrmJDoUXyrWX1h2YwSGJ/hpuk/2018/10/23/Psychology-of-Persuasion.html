My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2562384790">5 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
A great book with easy to understand examples and counter measures.<br /><br /><br /><br />2 Reciprocation: The Old Give and Take…and Take<br /><br />People feel they need to give back for any gift they receive. Most memorable was how the Hare Krishna’s got rich handing out recycled flowers.<br /><br />Another important thing covered was giving concessions whether real or imaginary to motivate others to agree to buy. Best example was the Watergate burglary which was sold to the Republicans as by concession.<br /><br /><br />3 Commitment and Consistency: Hobgoblins of the Mind<br /><br />About how people tend to be consistent and the small choices they make change their internal self representation.<br /><br />Great example was that by getting PoW to agree that America is not perfect they put them on the road to writing pro communist anti american essays.<br /><br />4 Social Proof: Truths Are Us<br /><br />Otherwise known as the bandwagon effect it is how by making something seem popular can promote you to go along with it.<br /><br />Best example was how he had trouble getting his three year old to learn to swim, but then found him swimming quite well simply because he saw another three year old swimming. <br /><br /><br />5 Liking: The Friendly Thief<br /><br />This is about where sales people want to pretend to be similar to you in order to get you to like them and want to buy from them.<br /><br /><br />Best example was a car salesman that sent people postcards every month that said ‘I Like You’<br />6 Authority: Directed Deference<br /><br />This is about how people will stop making decisions when there is a higher authority.<br /><br />Best example was that high percentage of nurses went to administer a potentially lethal dose of a medication to a patient simply because someone over the phone claiming to be a doctor told them to.<br /><br /><br />7 Scarcity: The Rule of the Few<br /><br />This was about how a lack of something made it more desirable.<br /><br />Best example was how when the new freedoms Gorbachev gave people were threatened by a coup the people of the Soviet Union rose up and rioted so hard that after only three days the USSR fell.<br /><br /><br />Wow! Impressive book many lessons, I’ve even applied some in my life, like the consistency principle by publicizing my intent to be a virtuous Buddhist I’ve reached a new level of consistency.
