<p>### Intro</p>

<p><a href="Yesterday">/1vLoKesxKQDnLFrmJDoUXyrWX1h2YwSGJ/prom/2017/11/07/Evolutionary-Programmer-Backprop.html</a> we were talking about the similarities between neuro-nets and computer programs.</p>

<p><a href="NEAT">http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/?stanley:gecco02b</a> is an evolutionary approach to making neural nets, and so today we’ll be
looking at how to integrate it with Pyash for making complex computer programs.</p>

<h3 id="names-or-innovation-numbers">Names or Innovation Numbers</h3>

<p>In NEAT, every neuron, or independent-clause has a name or Innovation Number.<br />
Fortunately in Pyash we have the nominative-case where we can store the name of a ceremony.<br />
The idea is that each independent-clause that takes inputs from the same variables, outputs
to the same variables, and uses the same verb has the same name. Even though the
values or weights in that independent-clause may be different.</p>

<p>Technically we only have to make the name based on the input and output
variables, because the verb is easy to find.</p>

<p>In Pyash there are roughly 700 temporary names, all starting with a 8 or 1, a
post-alveolar or dental click respectively.</p>

<p>Though if that is not enough, can use any of the almost 8000 normal words, 
 there are also many thousands of unassigned words,
and tens of thousands of words that don’t fit the phonotactics of the language
but can be put in the encoding.  Of course it is also possible to use multiple
words, again greatly increasing the available names. That should mean that we
could at least in theory evolve neural networks with thousands or possibly
millions of neurons.</p>

<p>It’s also possible for names to be numbers, in which case they can be stored in
a very compact manner. NEAT makes a new number for each innovation, and does
speciation based on persons that have shared ancestry as indicated by aligned
innovation numbers.</p>

<h3 id="variables">Variables</h3>

<p>Of course this also means that will need to support variables for input and
output.  For this we should have a look back at SystemC to make sure we are FPGA
compatible. Basically SystemC uses “wires” to connect modules, so everything
flows based on the clock.  Within a module variables act as they normally do in
C.</p>

<p>One issue with implementing something like that, is that it could lead to
synchronization bottlenecks, where have to wait on every part of a step to
finish, before anyone can move forward. An alternative could be to use the
Petri-net model.</p>

<h3 id="petri-nets">Petri Nets</h3>

<p>Petri-nets are the only modeling language with an exact mathematical definition. 
There are circles representing places or variables, and rectangles representing
actions, with arrows demonstrating connections.   Each action can only point to
a place, and each place can only point to an action.</p>

<p>So if we had a variable list, other than the name and value of the list, 
it could also have the names of the functions to which those values are
applicable.    Ideally one of these variables independet-clauses would be a 
queue, so it could work well in an asynchronous fashion.</p>

<p>After one run through the program.  could check if any of the variables still
had something in queue,  and if so then could run the associated functions,
removing the items from the queue.  Then repeat until there are no queued
variables remaining.   This would allow for running for-loops in an asynchronous
fashion. And that way wouldn’t have to execute all command statements, simply
check the variables.</p>

<h3 id="lstm-and-ntm">LSTM and NTM</h3>

<p>Recurrent Neural-nets and Neural Turing Machines, also have memory. They protect
the memory by using read, write and clear gates, which are only sometimes
triggered.  This is approximately equivalent to an if-conditional of traditional
programming approaches.</p>
