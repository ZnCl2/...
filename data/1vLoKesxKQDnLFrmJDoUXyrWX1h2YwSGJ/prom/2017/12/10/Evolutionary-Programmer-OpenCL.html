<p>OpenCL integration turned out to be more of a headache than I had initially
suspected.</p>

<h3 id="debugging-opencl">Debugging OpenCL</h3>

<p>I was getting
many errors that were wildly fluctuating with small numerical changes. 
This I eventually managed to narrow down to some includes, that I had for making
vector operations efficient on CPU, which weren’t necessary for the GPU, so
after taking out those includes that was mostly fixed.</p>

<p>Though I continued to have errors, primarily it seems to be because I was 
attempting to integrate it through a live GPU, and the program is rather large. 
I did eventually get it to work by using it via POCL or Portable OpenCL, 
that conforms to the OpenCL2.0 standard, and doesn’t have the issues GPU
hardware does at times.</p>

<h2 id="todo">TODO</h2>

<h3 id="opencl">OpenCL</h3>

<p>Eventually I’d like it working on GPU hardware also of course,  however for now
I’m happy to be able to simply run it multi-threaded thanks to POCL. On my
current laptop that means I can run 4 evolutionary islands simultaneously. 
I have my eye on some server hardware which has 16 cores per CPU, which would
greatly increase the amount of islands I can run.  However I think there is
still a lot of other things I have to do before can effectively take advantage
of the added scale.</p>

<p>Also I have several GPU cards I could try on my existing server, to see if they
would work.</p>

<h3 id="program-production">Program Production</h3>

<p>Other than evolving programs there are several other required steps.</p>

<p>This includes making an input stage, where can have the starting ceremonies 
and training series, and an output stage where the evolved program, or it’s best 
approximation (if acceptable) is produced as a named ceremony..</p>

<p>Ideally would be able to train multiple ceremonies in a row, especially ones
which are dependent upon each other.</p>

<h3 id="primitive-program-series">Primitive Program Series</h3>

<p>I need to find some other primitive programs I can evolve easily, 
so that I can have better unit testing over a more variable terrain.</p>

<p>Ideally it would be the sub programs necessary for doing translation.</p>

<h3 id="loops">Loops</h3>

<p>Loops are generally not found in spoken language, outside numerical recipes.
Though there is the “for-each” construct, which is action upon an series.</p>

<p>Not 100% sure what the best strategy is. Going with benefactive case could be an
Englishism, and may brake current sentence parsing. So may instead need to have
a special verb for looping over an series, such as the word “cyclic”.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>ceremony _ins series _acc cyclic _deo
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Ideally would be able to find out how the for-each concept is phrased
internationally, and pick something, from an SOV language for consistency.</p>
