Leaders Ask Great Questions: Your Foundation for Successful Leadership</a> by <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/68.John_C_Maxwell">John C.
Maxwell</a><br />
My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2452859648">5 of 5
stars</a><br /><br />
The book is composed of many great questions regarding leadership and their
corresponding answers.<br />John Maxwell clearly has had many decades of
experience in leadership, and has done significant research and practical
leadership training. Most of the book is entrenched in his experiences, but he
also cites some other sources such as books by Jim Collins. John Maxwell
certainly comes across as a Level 5 Leader (the best kind), and shares his how
it can be achieved. <br /><br />It’s a good book, I’d definitely recommend it to
anyone that wants to be a leader in life.<br />Also will likely read it again
when have leadership challenges, <br />as it has answers to many leadership
questions.<br /><br />here are some of my notes based on the chapter
headings:<br /><br /> PART I: QUESTIONS I ASK <br />1. Why Are Questions So
Important? <br />* “Instead of wondering what your next vacation is, maybe you
should set up a life<br />you don’t need to escape from.” <br /><br />2. What
Questions Do I Ask Myself as a Leader? <br />* have a list of questions to ask
yourself everyday <br />** to help maintain humility and other good leadership
qualities. <br /><br />3. What Questions Do I Ask My Team Members? <br />* what
do you think? <br />* how can I serve you? (what can I do to help you perform at
your best?) <br />* “It is impossible to learn anything important about anyone
until we get him <br /> or her to disagree with us; it is only in contradiction
that character is <br />disclosed. That is why autocratic employers usually
remain so ignorant about the <br />true nature of their subordinates.” <br /><br />PART II: QUESTIONS LEADERS ASK ME <br />4. What Must I Do to Lead Myself
Successfully? <br />* leaders must lead themselves before anyone else <br />*
discuss your blind spots with your inner circle <br /><br />5. How Does
Leadership Work? <br />* leadership is getting many people to work together,
many people one heart. <br /><br />6. How Do I Get Started in Leadership? <br /></p>
<ul>
  <li>leadership opportunities are everywhere<br /><br />7. How Do I Resolve
Conflict and Lead Challenging People?<br />* keep communication going or be
the one to initiate it<br />* ask if it is somehow your fault and if you can
improve<br />* the weaker person controls the relationship<br />* be willing to
let go of counter-productive people<br /><br />8. How Can I Succeed Working
Under Poor Leadership? <br />* figure out if it’s actually you that have the
problem<br />* find concrete evidence of fault and possible remedies<br />* be
prepared to move on<br /><br />9. How Can I Successfully Navigate Leadership
Transitions? <br />* consider succession as part of leadership, including
grooming successor.<br /><br />10. How Can I Develop Leaders? <br /> * give them
practice leading while you are still in power<br /> * be available to help after
you have left
