<p>The DevOps handbook is a very rich resource full of many useful teachings.
Here are some notes:</p>

<h2 id="main-idea">Main Idea</h2>

<p>The main idea is to automate as much as possible,
and keep everything deployable at all times.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>mistakes/accidents are  recategorized as “local learnings”.
and the idea is to have a blame-free post-mortem where we figure out what went
wrong, and how we can change the system to avoid such problems occuring in the future.
converting the “local-learnings” into global-learnings or organizational
learning,
and changing “packets of ignorance” into “packets of knowledge”<br />
via standardization and best-practice.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>technical debt, reserve 20% of cycles for non-functional requirements and reducing technical
debt.  We will actively manage this technical debt by ensuring that we invest at least
20% of all Development and Operations cycles on refactoring, investing in
automation work and architecture and non-functional requirements (NFRs,
sometimes referred to as the “ilities”), such as maintainability, manageability,
scalability, reliability, testability, deployability, and security.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>organization structure, service/market oriented organization seems to be quite
effective, where small teams are responsible for all aspects of the service
they deliver, and are only loosely coupled to the other services. Functional
teams are workable if everyone is regularly cross trained and changes positions
with others so they can see the big picture  and have fast feedback.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>monitoring/logging to see what is going on is essential for catching problems
early and resolving them. creates the feedback loops which lead to being able
to create high performance.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>integrate code into the trunk multiple times a day, with small changes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Continuous Delivery is when developers incorporate their changes into the
trunk continuously. All the changes go through the automated tests in a
production environment.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Continuous Deployment is when the product or service that is actively serving
customers is continiously updated.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Everything is included in version control, including documentation and
anything else that is necessary for a full deployment.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="testing">Testing</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Unit Testing, tests for various functions</li>
  <li>Acceptance Testing, tests from the client that must be passed.</li>
  <li>Integration Testing, tests for things working together</li>
  <li>Exploratory Testing, tests done with typically a human using the application.</li>
</ul>
