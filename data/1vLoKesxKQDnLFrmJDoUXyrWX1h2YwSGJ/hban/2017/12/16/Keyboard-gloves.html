<p>Glove keyboards have been in the common imagination for decades.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>He was eager as he touched the switch. His glasses flickered to life. Once again
his fingers carved into the empty air and began clicking together. ... 
The contacts on his fingers connected, and the letters appeared in the
lens of his glasses like ghosts in the air.

<p>However currently there is somewhat of a void in the wearable keyboard department.
While many attempts have been made over the years with a variety of keyers, few
have met with any success.</p>

<h3 id="tap-wearable">TAP wearable</h3>

<p>The most successful thus far is the <a href="https://www.tapwithus.com/">TAP wearable</a>,
though successful in this instance means an effective marketing campaign. It has
a previous iteration that also had good marketing but never made it into
customers hands.  This time there are at least some beta-testers. While they
promise to start shipping this month, we’ll see what happens.</p>

<p>The TAP is a very complicated piece of proprietary machinery. While I can’t
vouch for it’s reliability, in general the more complex something is, the more
often it brakes.</p>

<p>Also I haven’t read any sci-fi featuring the TAP, or any kind of tapping on your
leg kind of keyboards. In all the examples I saw people were sitting down, or
tapping on a surface, which is different from the typical mobile use-case of
people walking and standing.</p>

<p>Another issue with the TAP, is that being a single-handed thing, much like the
<a href="http://www.keyglove.net/">KeyGlove</a> it is probably limited to 32 or so input
letters.  Meaning it is only really useful for texting, and not for formatting
documents, gaming or computer programming.</p>

<h3 id="simple-glove-keyboards">Simple Glove Keyboards</h3>

<p>My proposed alternative is a very simple wearable glove keyboard.</p>

<p>Here is an example prototype description</p>

<ol>
  <li>Take a pair of anti-static polyester gloves</li>
  <li>Sew conductive fabric onto all the finger tips</li>
  <li>Sew an independent conductive connection to each finger tip, with snap
connectors at the wrist. 
4 Repeat for both hands.</li>
  <li>Snap a 6 wire ribbon (with 5 live wires) to the glove,</li>
  <li>connect  the thumbs to ground,  and
the fingers to digital pins with input high..</li>
  <li>with a bluetooth module, and a little software it’s a keyboard,
where each hand is responsible for 4 bits. A 1 is when finger touches ground,
indexfinger is lowest place.</li>
</ol>

<p>The Ctrl, Alt and Super keys are the only ones that may need special treatment, as may
have to press them, click some other letter, and then press them again to
release.</p>

<p>Otherwise it’s all pretty straight keyboard stuff. May also need to put in some
time delay, in case not all the contacts hit at the same time.</p>

<h4 id="mouse-control">Mouse Control</h4>

<p>Since standard keyboard codes start at 8, can do mouse controls underneath.</p>

<p>For VR, 3, 6, and 7 can be left, right, and middle click respectively.</p>

<p>For AR, 1, 2, 4, 5 can be left, right, down and up respectively. 
Can follow the <a href="http://www.semicomplete.com/projects/keynav">keynav</a> or a more
traditional style with acceleration based on preference.</p>

<h3 id="software">Software</h3>

<p>The easiest to implement would be using standard 
<a href="https://www.cambiaresearch.com/articles/15/javascript-char-codes-key-codes">keycodes</a>,
that way would have maximum compatibility with ordinary keyboards.</p>

<p>0x41 (ring finger touching thumb on left hand, and index touching thumb on right
hand) would be ‘a’.</p>

<p>0x42 (same with left hand, and middle touching thumb on right) ‘b’
0x43 (same left, both index and middle touching thumb on right) ‘c’</p>

<p>and so on.</p>

<p>An alternative would be to use direct encodings like ASCII or UTF16 for input
Though may need to do some arduino side conversion so that it would appear to 
the computer to be a standard keyboard.  The alternative would be making a 
whole new driver which would be much more work. Though the
<a href="http://joy2chord.sourceforge.net/">joy2chord</a> seems like it may be
possible to use as a basis, at least for Linux based systems.</p>

<p>UTF16 based system would be most useful for Chinese, since they have around 3000
common chracters. All of which could be entered with “two keystrokes”, or
touching fingers together twice in appropriate arrangement.</p>

<p>Most other languages that have less than 67 letters alongside the standard
numbers and symbols would be able to fit in a single touch.</p>
