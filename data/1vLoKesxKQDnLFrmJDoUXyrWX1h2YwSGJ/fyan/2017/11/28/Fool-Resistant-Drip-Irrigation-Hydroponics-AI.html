<h1 id="canaba-proud-and-free">Canaba proud and free</h1>

<p>Canada is introducing new legislation by July 2018, that will allow adult
Canadians to grow up to 4 Marijuana plants in their household, or on their
property. For many this may be their first attempt at growing a plant,
and they may want a fool-resistance low-mainteance and high efficiency
drip system, which can be used both indoors and outdoors.</p>

<p>While Canadians will also be allowed to buy Marijuana from federal or provincial
retailers.  Marijuana is sufficiently expensive on a per-gram basis that it is
cost-effective to grow your own. For example under the legislation each person 
is allowed to carry around up to 30 grams of Marijuana. At $10 per gram, that
is $300 worth of marijuana.</p>

<h2 id="cost-effectiveness">Cost-effectiveness</h2>

<p>An average
<a href="https://www.livescience.com/55464-marijuana-average-joint.html">joint</a> has 
roughly a third of a gram of Marijuana. About
<a href="http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/how-big-is-canadas-marijuana-market-really/">8\%</a> 
of people consume marijuana a few times a week. If that amounts to 3 joints, or
a gram a week, then it could be expected they consume 52 grams a year, with
perhaps more on special occasions, so can round it to 60, which would mean any
system that costs less than $600 per year, would be more economical than buying.
 There are roughly <a href="http://www.statcan.gc.ca/tables-tableaux/sum-som/l01/cst01/demo10a-eng.htm">29 million</a> adults in Canada. So roughly 2.3 million regular marijuana consumers. If <a href="http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/nhs-enm/2011/as-sa/99-014-x/99-014-x2011002-eng.cfm">65\%</a> of
those can grow in their household, that leaves 1.5 million people for whom it 
would be cost-effective to grow their own.</p>

<h2 id="basements">Basements</h2>

<p>Of the people that have households, many have 
<a href="https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090618102830AAlvwoU">basements</a>
due to foundation requirements, though often they are short, since usually only 
need to dig the foundation <a href="http://buildingcode.online/1563.html">1.2m</a> deep 
(4ft). Usually with some added height for windows it may give an unfinished 
basement a height of 1.7m, (a height of 2m is required to finish a basement).<br />
I mention this because one of the most trendy hydroponic methods, which is the
Deep Water Culture or <a href="http://www.growweedeasy.com/high-yield-bubbleponics-technique">Bubbleponics</a> (which is usually 0.5m high) in combination 
with high efficiency LED lights (which are 0.1m high and have to be kept 
0.6m away from the plants), leaves only 0.5-0.8m for the plants, which can grow
up to 1m high.</p>

<p>There is a solution however, where plants
are only 20cm off the ground by using a
<a href="http://www.canadiantire.ca/en/pdp/rubbermaid-roughneck-tote-37-9-l-0422964p.html#srp">short-tote</a>, 
for drip-irrigation and use an <a href="http://www.growweedeasy.com/led-grow-lights#advanced-platinum-led-grow-lights">special LED light</a> that allows it to be closer (45cm) during flowering. 
Giving a total of 1.8m, so it should fit in most Canadian basements. Can make it
1.7 meter by either training the plant to be under 0.9m, or by having a flatter
drip collection tray.</p>

<h2 id="automated-drip-irrigation">Automated Drip Irrigation</h2>

<p>While drip irrigation is highly efficient, it has it’s own unique issues. The
biggest time-suck being figuring out how to set and adjust the timers for
optimal growth.</p>

<p>By using a <a href="https://www.sifive.com/products/hifive1/">RISC-V Arduino</a> have
enough horsepower and memory to run a simple AI watering system that can be 
trained to give optimal results.</p>

<p>The primary plant-side sensor would be for
<a href="https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/soil-moisture-sensor-hookup-guide">soil-moisture</a>,
it should also have a <a href="https://www.dfrobot.com/product-1110.html">ph-sensor</a> 
for the resevoir and a
<a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Measuring-water-level-with-ultrasonic-sensor/">water-level-meter</a>. 
That way if the PH goes out of range, or water-level gets too low, it could send
an email to the primary user to notify them of the problem.</p>

<p>For the AI portion, it would need some training, while it will certainly come
pre-trained,  people can give it additional training to suit their needs and
conditions.  For instance either through a web-interface or LCD with buttons,
people could notify the AI if they are putting in a new plant, whether it is
currently vegetative or flowering, and even what kind of plant it is.
Additionally people could mention how the plant is doing when they stop by to
check.  The default LCD could be asking “how are the plants”,  if the person
says good, it can reinforce what it is doing,  if they say bad, can ask them if
it is a water or PH problem,  if one of those, can ask if it needs to be higher
or lower,  then the neuro-net can be adjusted accordingly.</p>

<h2 id="domain">Domain</h2>

<p>Of course this system isn’t only applicable to Marijuana, it could be applicable
to a wide variety of plants grown by drip irrigation.  Out in the field it gets
a bit more difficult as sensors would have to be spread out pretty far.</p>

<p>However to narrow the range at least initially, will be to make a system that
is for 4 plants, specializing in Marijuana.</p>

<h2 id="testing">Testing</h2>

<p>I hope to build this system within the next year, and have it ready for the time
that Marijuana is legal to grow, in order to test it out. If all goes well,
could package it and sell such systems to fellow Canadians, or maybe even internationally.</p>

<h2 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer</h2>

<p>I have not consumed marijuana or any other drug in many years. 
Also I have never grown any.  So this is as much an experiment in automating
drip-irrigation as anything else.</p>

<p>That it can conceivably turn a profit, if this experiment works, and can be
appropriately packaged and distributed, means I can consider this experiment 
in automating drip-irrigation a business expense.</p>
