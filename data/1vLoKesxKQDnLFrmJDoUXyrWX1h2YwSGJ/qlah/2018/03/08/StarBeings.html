<p>I was telepathically communicating with some star beings in their spaceship
today.</p>

<p>Generally 4th density star beings fly around, visit various places, mostly to
study and observe.  They return the information to their home base. In this
function they are much like reporters or journalists.</p>

<p>They also engage in some resource acquisition, trade, and may share some 
teachings.</p>

<p>If/when Earth becomes mature enough to participate in the galactic community, 
that would open the door for tourism to other worlds,  though most don’t have an
economic system with money as found on Earth, so would need to figure out
another form of exchange, such as with barter.</p>

<p>The typical barter is that in exchange for hosting people on their planet, is to
send some to be hosted on our planet.  Much like how we have exchange-students.
The main purpose indeed being the study and acquisition of knowledge.</p>

<p>They hope that those they send here would be treated with the same respect as
those they receive.  One of the problems with the level of maturity on Earth, is
that trust is not there right now,  humans have a bad habit of taking visitors
apart on operating tables, rather than simply communicating with them, showing
them around, and being otherwise hospitable,  by which they would learn even
more than on the operating table.</p>

<p>Another issue may be things like racism, and other forms of prejudice, if star
beings were to visit some small town,  then vigilantes or something may be a
problem.  Especially considering that it is difficult for humans to
differentiate between the many kinds of Gray-morph aliens, some of which are
primarily of service to others, or of a helping and compassionate nature  and 
some of which have a more take and use, service to self attitude.</p>

<p>The take-and-use Grays make a hard time for the compassionate Grays, as it
creates confusion in the human mind-stream, which often conflates the two
together.  However if the Earth calling was more unified it would be possible to
exclude the take-and-use Grays, and only allow the compassionate ones, but that
would again require greater maturity than currently achieved.</p>

<p>For more permanent cohabitation it would be necessary to provide sanctuary or
biosphere like areas with atmospheric conditions that are compatible with the
home-world of the visiting beings.</p>

<p>If going farther still in these relations would be possible to have hybrid
children, maybe even ones which are capable of long-term life in both
atmospheric conditions.</p>

<p>Another possibility is exchane of virtual-reality or educational technology.
Which they hope will not be abused.</p>

<p>When I asked them about sentient robots and such, they said that it’s too
abstract a concept, since they don’t exist yet  so they can’t really comment on it. 
I asked about robots on other worlds, but they say there they serve a mostly
servant like function, and the sentient robot idea is fairly unique to this
planet. So they’ll have to take the “wait and see” approach regarding it.</p>
