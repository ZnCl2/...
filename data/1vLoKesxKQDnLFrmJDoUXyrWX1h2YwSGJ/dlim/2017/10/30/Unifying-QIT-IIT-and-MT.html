<p>Hi All,</p>

<p>If you are interested in spirit/soul and Information Theory,
I may have an idea that could help you get funding for your research.
Particularly in Hindu/Buddhist nations but maybe also in silicon valley.
If you are a die-hard materialist can probably skip this thread.</p>

<p>The basic idea is making a mathematical/theoretical framework for
uploading and-or reincarnation. This could garner the whole field a
lot of attention, and offer something falsifiable with practical
predictive power. If unified with M-Theory it could help answer the
question of “where are the other dimensions?”</p>

<h2 id="ideas">IDEAS</h2>

<p>Idea-one,  is based on no-delete principle of Quantum Information
Theory (QIT),  particularly when joined with Integrated Information
Theory (IIT).</p>

<p>For example when some information is exclusively integrated in a body,
 then that information can’t be deleted[1] as that would be a loss of
entropy.
Similarly if that integrated information is split, it would also lower
entropy, as it would then be multiple simpler pieces of information.
Thus that integrated information container (soul) would need to
migrate elsewhere upon body-death.</p>

<p>Idea-two, with M-theory we could say that it migrates to the
information-world (soul-world), which is co-located with this one, but
on several of those extra-dimensions M-theory says exist.</p>

<p>While based on semi-classified time-travel data[2][3][4] one would
have to conclude there are multiple dimensions of time.  Based on
in-between-life regression[5], one would have to conclude there is
also an information-world where people’s information primarily
resides,  only a part of it filtering into/outof any given incarnation.</p>

<h2 id="marketing">MARKETING</h2>

<p>Due to confirmation bias and belief perseverance this research
probably couldn’t be conducted at most YOLO (you only live once)
institutions of the materialist, Christian or Islamic persuasion.</p>

<p>Though once there is some initial published research, they may provide
funding for disproving it.</p>

<p>Also if you happen to be near silicon valley, can try to get funding
from tech billionaires that are interested in uploading, or
reincarnating into machines.</p>

<h2 id="predictions">PREDICTIONS</h2>

<p>One possibly prediction is if we take the no-cloning theorem of
quantum information theory then could surmise that a physical attempt
at a copy would not be sufficient for uploading to occur. Though
perhaps the math could point to what would be sufficient.</p>

<h2 id="falsificationverification">FALSIFICATION/VERIFICATION</h2>

<p>One could do FMRI scans of someone doing either an in-between-life
regression or  past-life regression, with a control group of people
told to fabricate a story.  And then can see if the same brain regions
light up.</p>

<p>If there are consistent differences, could investigate what brain
regions are involved and if some kind of technological analog can be
made for verifying it.  Such a device if effective can then go on to
be used to potentially verify M-Theory.</p>

<h2 id="disclaimer">DISCLAIMER</h2>

<p>My grasp of math is very limited.</p>

<h2 id="bonus">BONUS</h2>

<p>The “semi-classified” time-travel information is classified as
conspiracy theory in the main stream. Based on the extreme lack of
creativity is most fiction (most sci-fi consists of humans, doing
contemporary stuff, with a few environmental differences), it is my
hypothesis that most sources of complex information have a source.</p>

<p>I don’t know if there is any way of quantifying that, but if there was
it could be an interesting pursuit.</p>
