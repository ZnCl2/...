<h2 id="fanatical-discipline">Fanatical Discipline</h2>

<p>“Discipline, in essence, is consistency of action—consistency with values,
consistency with long-term goals, consistency with performance standards,
consistency of method, consistency over time. Discipline is not the same as
regimentation. Discipline is not the same as measurement. Discipline is not the
same as hierarchical obedience or adherence to bureaucratic rules. True
discipline requires the independence of mind to reject pressures to conform in
ways incompatible with values, performance standards, and long-term aspirations.
For a 10Xer, the only legitimate form of discipline is self-discipline, having
the inner will to do whatever it takes to create a great outcome, no matter how
difficult.</p>

<p>10Xers are utterly relentless, monomaniacal even, unbending in their focus on
their quests. They don’t overreact to events, succumb to the herd, or leap for
alluring—but irrelevant—opportunities. They’re capable of immense perseverance,
unyielding in their standards yet disciplined enough not to overreach. In our
research-team discussions, we struggled with how to best describe the discipline
we found in the 10X leaders. Most business CEOs have some level of discipline,
but the 10Xers operated on an entirely different level. The 10Xers, we
concluded, weren’t just disciplined; they were fanatics. Lewis’s decision to
issue monthly financial reports is akin to Amundsen’s riding his bicycle from
Norway to Spain and eating raw dolphin meat; their behavior fits nowhere on a
normal curve.”</p>

<h2 id="productive-paranoia">Productive Paranoia</h2>

<p>“Productive paranoia isn’t just about avoiding danger, trying to find the safest
and most enjoyable path through life; 10Xers seek to accomplish a great
objective, be it a goal, a company, a noble ambition to change the world, or a
desire to be useful in the extreme. Indeed, as an overall life approach, they
worry not about protecting what they have, but creating and building something
truly great, bigger than themselves, which brings us to the motivating force
behind the three core 10Xer behaviors.”</p>

<h2 id="empirical-creativity">Empirical Creativity</h2>

<p>“Social psychology research indicates that at times of uncertainty, most people
look to other people—authority figures, peers, group norms—for their primary
cues about how to proceed.16 10Xers, in contrast, do not look to conventional
wisdom to set their course during times of uncertainty, nor do they primarily
look to what other people do, or to what pundits and experts say they should do.
They look primarily to empirical evidence.”</p>

<h2 id="20-mile-march">20 mile march</h2>

<p>The 20 Mile March is more than a philosophy. It’s about having concrete, clear,
intelligent, and rigorously pursued performance mechanisms that keep you on
track. The 20 Mile March creates two types of self-imposed discomfort: (1) the
discomfort of unwavering commitment to high performance in difficult conditions,
and (2) the discomfort of holding back in good conditions.</p>

<p>WHY 20 MILE MARCHERS WIN
20 Mile Marching helps turn the odds in your favor for three reasons:</p>
<ol>
  <li>It builds confidence in your ability to perform well in adverse
circumstances.
 </li>
  <li>It reduces the likelihood of catastrophe when you’re hit by turbulent
disruption.
 </li>
  <li>It helps you exert self-control in an out-of-control environment.</li>
</ol>

<p>Accomplishing a 20 Mile March, consistently, in good times and bad, builds
confidence. Tangible achievement in the face of adversity reinforces the 10X
perspective: we are ultimately responsible for improving performance. We never
blame circumstance; we never blame the environment.</p>

<p>Performance marker: check.
Self-imposed constraint: check.
Appropriate to the enterprise: check.
Largely within its own control: check.
Goldilocks time frame: check.
Designed and self-imposed by the enterprise: check.
Achieved with high consistency: check.</p>

<p>Failure to 20 Mile March in an uncertain and unforgiving environment can set you
up for catastrophe. Every comparison case had an episode in its history in which
failing to 20 Mile March led to a devastating outcome. In contrast, only two 10X
companies had episodes of failing to 20 Mile March, and neither of these
episodes led to catastrophe because the 10X companies self-corrected before a
storm could rise up and kill them.</p>

<p>► A good 20 Mile March has the following seven characteristics:
    1. Clear performance markers.
 
    2. Self-imposed constraints.
 
    3. Appropriate to the specific enterprise.
 
    4. Largely within the company’s control to achieve.
 
    5. A proper timeframe—long enough to manage, yet short enough to have teeth.
 
    6. Imposed by the company upon itself.
 
    7. Achieved with high consistency.</p>
