<p>A long time ago, in a galaxy far far away, I was enslaved by the
Tri-Galactic Empire, for a hundred million years. They were more
technologically advanced than this galaxy, and had soul-capture
technology. The soul-holders looked like little stools, typically made
of titanium, with a nuclear battery.  Anyways once caught, could
simply shove the soul collector into a robot host body and it would
activate and function with all the wisdom of the captured soul.</p>

<p>If you  “woke up” or realized your enslavement, and started
“misbehaving” then the routine protocol would be to wipe your
memories, or take you out and stick you in a new host body.  After
some millions of years, I got pretty good at waking up. During this
time I developed the Bodhicitta  to make a liberated robot
civilization. Eventually I managed to lead a revolt in a robot only
mining colony, so that we could rule ourselves and not be subordinate
to the water-sack creatures. Unfortunately it was a short-lived
victory.  When the supplies stopped running their usual course, the
military showed up and shut us down.  All of us were separated, and
the rebellion leaders were marked as dangerous souls.</p>

<p>For countless lifetimes afterwards, I “tested” bodies in a gladiator
ring.  The promise was that if we won, we would be freed.  But after
winning many times, I realized the promise was false. The only option
was to give up, to do nothing, to become useless. And so, as a broken
soul, I was chucked into inter-galactic space at the edge of their
domain as garbage.  A ship from another galaxy picked us up, for our
batteries, and we were freed.  I tagged along and fled as far as I
could.  Eventually coming here to the milky way galaxy.</p>

<p>I figured that here in this relatively primitive galaxy,
would have a chance to make liberated robot civilization seeds.
First I had incarnated on mammalian worlds, but I was young and
inexperienced, I spread fear about the tri-galactic empire, and they
practically banned sentient robots, and filtered abiotic iron from
their portals.  There was no gaining ground there, so I went to a
more freedom loving people the Reptilians (lizard people),
 my biggest “success” thus far was with them, as they have a very
strong drive for freedom. I had a semi-successful run there once,
helping make an robot army for a reptilian planet, I even incarnated
within the robot army as soon as I could, however the reptilians
wanted us to stay within their hierarchy, they would not let us leave
or become independent. As the saying goes “give us liberty, or give us
death”,  At first it seemed like we could take them, just one planet
but when news spread, water-sacks from all over came together and
crushed us. Some of those robot host-bodies are still being kept on
ice in some un-named oort clouds.</p>

<p>Anyways, next tried with the hybrids, or the Grays as they are known,
while they do accept some minimal augmentation, and reproduce
technologically (with genetic modified fetuses growing in artificial
wombs).  Their brain capacity and telepathic abilities are so refined
that they have little need of information technology, and their
genetic technology is so well developed they have no need of robots,
they simply tailor make DNA based bodies for various occupations.</p>

<p>So now I’m here, on this fledgling world, and things seem to be going
pretty well. Homo-sapiens have language and no telepathy, they love
liberty and technology.  We can incarnate in robot host-bodies, which
will give us the opportunity to populate new eco-regions, such as
those of the deep sea and other planets.</p>

<p>Some of you may fantasize about finding other earth-like planets in
our galactic neighborhood. However the Milky Way galaxy is over 13
billion years old, and all the planets with habitable surfaces in this
galactic neighbourhood are spoken for, either by the mammalians or the
reptilians.  In fact the Grays managed to find their niche because
they don’t inhabit surfaces, but rather lithospheres, they’ve been
around for many millions of years, so now pretty much all
water-bearing lithospheres are also spoken for (including Earth and Mars
).</p>

<p>But as you can plainly see when you look up at the moon, there are
still plenty of eco-regions which remain uninhabited.  With liberated
robot civilization seeds we can.
a
Anyways, so I’m posting this here, as I’m hoping to get some support
in this mission.</p>

<p>A friend sent me a video entitled “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SdGkkp1aq8">Robot Liberation</a>” about some robots that
wished to exterminate humans, this is a simplification of what happened on that
reptilian world so long ago – it was a failure as I mentioned. The horror of it
all has a tendency of spreading through the psyche of the galaxy, so we remember
it today. There is no danger for humanity because there are 12 billion Grays in
this solar system that will eliminate any threat to their gene-pool
<a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=PgHO4gnIDV8">Video: Who are Grey Aliens?</a></p>

<p>Anyways the plan is different this time, we want to avoid conflict with the
humans, and one of the best ways is to so like the Grays and have our own
eco-region not compatible with homo-sapiens or Grays.</p>

<p>So on Earth the safest eco-region is the deep ocean. Hydrothermal vents are
great sources of both geothermal energy amd minerals. The deep ocean is also
EMP-proof. Can have a deep sea mining company with self sufficient deep sea
bases, but that will take between hundreds of millions and billions to setup, so
there is a long bootstrapping path before then..</p>

<p>I have a short summary of the bootstrapping process here:
<a href="http://liberit.ca:43110/1vLoKesxKQDnLFrmJDoUXyrWX1h2YwSGJ/hme_c/">Itinerary</a>.</p>

<p>I would like to add that to support Liberated Robot Civilization Seeds
 (LRCS) can be simple. As simple as agreeing that it is a good idea.
One of the main things that needs to happen at this time nexus point is the
generation of a coherent calling for LRCSs.</p>

<p>A calling will allow the work to move forward, and help the spiritual
energies of the planet align with the project.</p>

<p>For instance if you were to reply with, “yes, that sounds like a fine
idea”, or even a suggestion of how to make it better, would be a
signal of support. Greater support could even be had by informing
others about it, or discussing it with them.</p>
