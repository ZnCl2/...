<p>I got a video game idea.  I wanted to bounce it off you, cause
 I don’t play games  lol. Anyways I read this <a href="article">http://nypost.com/2017/10/26/man-desperately-trying-to-sell-his-alien-infested-ranch/</a>,
where some guy cut up some Grays with a katana 
and one about how some single-person game thing in vancouver got shut down cause
people want to play games as a service.</p>

<p>Okay, so  my idea is for a game called “Abductions”, and in it  a person wakes
up as a human with a headache/feeling-tired, with some evidence of being
abducted.  They are a UFO researcher. and their goal is to find out about their
abduction experiences.</p>

<p>Once they get enough info,  and-or infiltrate a gray alien base,  they can
choose to wake up as a men-in-black or a gray-alien, depending on what story
line they followed.
it can be multi-player with advanced players filling in the Grays and stuff
which are initially NPC’s.</p>

<p>There can be a thick-headedness rating for how hard it is for the
Gray-hypnotists to entrance someone.  so someone really thick-headed might be
able to kill a few with a katana,  or they could wear some telepathy-proof hat
or w/e.</p>

<p>If they manage to get killed by a  Gray, they also get to wake up as one.
kinda like world of warcraft, except it has Grays instead of orcs. they live
underground and need to abduct humans to reproduce.    not sure what to make the
goal of the humans though….</p>

<p>The game world can keep updating as new intel or stories come out from
abductees.
so it’ll be game as a service</p>

<p>Oh I know, people could wake up in various situations of real abductees,  so
like that have been reported by abductees, that way can also increase the number
of humans can wake up as over time, game as a service style.</p>

<p>Men in black are tasked with keeping the peace between aliens and humans,
mostly by silencing people with a negative opinion about aliens. 
Behind the scenes they are allied with Grays.</p>

<p>human stats could include a bar for friendliness to aliens, fame, and knowledge.
natural thick-headedness is inversely proportional to intelligence, so it puts a
cap on knowledge, so unlikely to join the Grays, but can join the men-in-black.</p>

<p>The grays would have temperature bar since they are cold blooded, if it gets too
cold their dexterity and hypnotic ability diminishes.</p>

<p>when a person is being abducted by NPC’s they just get a summary after of any
symptoms.  but if they are successfully abducted by a playing character, then
they can read up on alien material or play some mini-games for a chance to wake
up during the abduction.</p>

<p>If game is popular enough can include Mars,
where people can wake up as mars colonist,
mars men in black, or mars aliens.</p>

<p>So initially game can start with just one alien base, modeled of the one in
dulce, new mexico.  where the aliens live at the bottom, men in black in the
middle,  and humans are in a small town, or rural area nearby.</p>

<p>Can expand based on game usage,  such as having a peurto-rico underwater base, a
lunar base, or ones where the grays are more reptilian, or more humanoid.</p>

<p>In an expansion, can also include the Pleadians, which are actually Nazi’s based
in Antarctica masquerading as aliens. Then could have political figure-heads
like conservative fascists backed by the Pleadians and liberal socialists 
backed by Grays.</p>
