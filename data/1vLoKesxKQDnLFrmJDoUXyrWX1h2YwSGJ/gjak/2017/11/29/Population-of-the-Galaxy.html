<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/43/ESO-VLT-Laser-phot-33a-07.jpg/1280px-ESO-VLT-Laser-phot-33a-07.jpg" />
Unlike many blog posts that invoke the Fermi Paradox, I’m not going to pretend
that thousands of witnesses, hundreds of whistle blowers, gigabytes of photo and
video evidence about Gray aliens don’t exist. No, instead I’m interested in
SciFi that is brave enough to accept the fact of panspermia, and work with them.</p>

<p>So here I’d like to lay out a modification Drake Equation for getting a feel of
how many people are in our galaxy right about now, or what the population is.</p>

<p>S * h * P = L</p>

<p>(S) Number of stars in the galaxy, (h) times the fraction of them which are
habitable, (P) times the fraction of
planets which are Earth-like and in the Goldilocks zone, equals the number of
planets with water-based life On them.</p>

<p>The Milky Way reportedly has about a 100 billion stars (S). Of those only G-type
Yellow Dwarfs (like the sun) 7.6\%, K-type Orange Dwarfs (slightly dimmer)
12.1\%, and F-type 3\% which are slightly brighter. That’s 22.7% in total.
Brighter than F-type live too-short, and darker than K-type have too much flare
activity.</p>

<p>All stars seem to have planets, scientists also estimate is about 40\% of 
stars have Earth-like planets in their Goldilocks zones.</p>

<p>So that gives us:</p>

<p>100 billion * 22.7% * 40% = 9 billion Goldilocks planets.</p>

<p>So under Panspermia we could presume the majority of those have at least
single-celled water-based organisms.</p>

<p>However for complex life we need to refine it further.
This is because at F-type which are slightly brighter, the stars only live a 
few billion years, so a planet there may not even
have a chance to experience a Cambrian Explosion event (when large complex
animals arose) – which happened after the Earth was already 4 billion years 
old. The Cambrian Explosion happened only 540 million years ago, and the 
Earth is expected to remain habitable only another billion years at most 
before the sun gets too hot.</p>

<p>That means we take out the F-type stars. Leaves us with 8 billion planets.</p>

<p>So with an optimal habitable period of 1.5 billion years, and total lifetime of
10 billion years for our star, that’s about 15\% of the time. Though
cyanobacteria managed to thrive on our planet even 3.5 billion years ago.</p>

<p>Orange dwarves on the other hand live twice as long a Yellow Dwarves and don’t
increase in brightness significantly so may have a significantly longer
habitable period. Though for simplicity lets say it’s also only 15\% of the time
the planets are experiencing habitable conditions.</p>

<p>Means we now multiply what we have left by 15 percent. Leaving us with 1 billion
Goldilocks planets in the Milky Way which are currently conducive to 
complex life.</p>

<p>Now since we don’t have any better estimates on what fraction of those have
intelligent life, we’ll take the &lt;a href-“http://www.lawofone.info/results.php?s=16#24”&gt;Ra Material&lt;/a&gt;.
  Where what we think of as intelligent life with bodies, is third (27\%), 
fourth (16\%), and fifth (6\%) `density’, or about 49\%.</p>

<p>So that’s roughly 600 million planets.</p>

<p>However, additionally Ra mentions that civilizations only tend to maintain
corporeal form for about 100 million years (from third to fifth density). Which
is about 6\% of the 1.5 billion years that complex life should be viable on
Earth.</p>

<p>so that’s 36 million planets, with currently corporeal civilizations.</p>

<p>Now the population of those planets is more iffy.  If they all had
hunter-gatherer lifestyles,  each planet would have a 100 million people.</p>

<p>Totalling 4 quadrillion people in the galaxy.</p>

<p>If everyone lived like Americans, then 2 billion per planet, so that would be 70
quadrillion people.</p>

<p>If there was a more rationed approach, perhaps 10 billion would be good, so 400
Quadrillion.</p>

<p>If we narrow it down, to just our galactic neighbourhood within 5,000 light
years.  There are 200 million stars.  Then there would be about 70,000 civilized
planets, with between 7 and 700 billion people.</p>

<p>If we narrow it down to 100 light years.  There are 15 thousand stars.<br />
Then there would be about 5 civilized star systems, with possibly 50 billion
people.</p>

<p>Now this is really the lower limit, as it gets rather more complicated since can
have multiple habitable planets in a solar system, though they aren’t
necessarily habitable at the same time.</p>

<p>Scientists agree that Venus may have once been habitable[5].
For example our good friend Ra says that two and a half billion years ago he
lived in ``difficult conditions’’ on Venus. So at that point it may have
already been deteriorating. He mentioned that Venus experienced rapid evolution.
The Earth of that time would have been a fairly inhospitable rock, with little
more than micro fauna, and negligible oxygen levels. Perhaps the UV splitting of
water into H and O could help explain how it happened on Venus so fast –
whereas on Earth, most of the oxygenation was the result of photosynthesis.</p>

<p>Scientists also agree that Mars was once habitable, and they keep increasing the
timeline, though so far think it stopped being habitable 3.1 billion years ago.
However that would be inconsistent with the planet being red from complete 
oxidation, something that only happened on Earth about 800 million years ago.</p>

<p>Channelled reports say that some cataclysm led to the destruction of the atmosphere
around a million years ago. Plenty believe that the pyramids and the other
megalithic structures on Mars are consistent with this.</p>

<p>Also the former planet between Mars and Jupiter, named Maldek, is believed to
also have had intelligent life.</p>

<p>Though neither Mars nor Maldek made it to fourth density – the density of the
social mind complex. Instead they destroyed themselves, as they had more
technology than emotional maturity.  However some more peaceful star systems may
have multiple planets with intelligent life simultaneously.</p>

<p>Another thing is that they are the Gray archetype, of lithosphere dwelling
hominids.  They are capable of living in any accessible water-bearing 
lithosphere where it is warm enough. That means that for instance in our solar
system they inhabit the lithospheres of Earth, Mars, Ceres, Europa and possibly
some other watery moons with active cores. They have declared their population
in our solar system at 12 billion, in the Chilbolton crop glyphs.</p>

<p>So if you consider lithosphere dwellers, that would easily double the 
population within 100 light years to 100 billion.</p>

<p>There are reports about a number of populated star systems. They split primarily
into two old camps, and one newer camp.  The old camps being the mammalian,
Nordic like people, that comprise the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Federation' and started in the Lyra
constellation.
The reptilian lizard like people, that comprise the </code>Draconian Empire’
and started in the Draco constellation. 
The new camp being the hybrids, or Grays, that comprise the `Orion Empire’,
which started in the Orion constellation.</p>

<p>All of those constellations have numerous G-type stars within 100 light years of
Earth. Based on our own fossil record, one could surmise that at some point
Earth belonged to the reptilians (Draconian Empire),<br />
but then there was a change in ownership to the mammalians (Federation). 
Currently, archaeological  evidence such as the Great Pyramids point to the Orion
Empire having the most influence. Including the fact that Grays are the most
common alien.</p>

<p>Zeta Reticuli, which has 3 G-type stars between 35 and 40 light years away –
original home of many Grays.</p>

<p>Tau Ceti is the closest inhabited G-type star system, at only 12 light years 
distance.  It reportedly has a race of Nordic people descendant from Lyra.</p>

<p>The constellation Lyra has numerous G-type stars between 50 and 90 light years
away, so which of these is currently inhabited is not clear. But it is believed
to be the origin place of the Nordic style extra-terrestrials – quite likely
tens or hundreds of millions of years ago as they have spread far and wide.</p>

<p>The constellation Draco has numerous G-type stars between 19 and 100 light years
The closest one Sigma Draconis may have had something to do with the initial
seeding of Earth,  however there don’t seem to be any reports about it now, so
it is likely dormant. The reptilians are known to be warlike, so it is not
unlikely they blew themselves up, or otherwise made things uninhabitable.  Of
course just because it bears the name Draconis, doesn’t meat it ever was part of
the Draconian empire.  The other Draco stars are over 45 light years distant.</p>

<p>Orion G-type stars range from 28 to a hundred light years distant. The closest
of them Chi1 Orionis, is probably not inhabited due to a nearby red dwarf with
it’s solar flare activity.</p>

<p>Now while none of the old-camps could inhabit a star-system without an
Earth-like planet for more than an outpost.  The new camp of the Grays can if
there are planets with accessible water bearing lithospheres and active cores. 
However Grays also need a large amount of genetic material for their constant
modification, so typically need at least one planet in a solar system to have an
old-camp biosphere.  In theory it may be possible for a Gray-class civilization
to subsist on deep-ocean biodiversity, but it would likely be a subsistence
lifestyle that’s not highly favoured. While humans can eat bark, they generally
don’t choose to move somewhere, where that is the only food source.</p>
