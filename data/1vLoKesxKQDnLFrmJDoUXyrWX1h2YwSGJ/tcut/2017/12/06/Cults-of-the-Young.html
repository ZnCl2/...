<p>Today I came across an
<a href="https://medium.com/@bescofield/tech-bro-guru-inside-the-sedona-cult-of-bentinho-massaro-a56314f830ef">article</a>, 
of what may have happened to me had I become massively popular in my early 
twenties.
It talks about a “cult” or new religious movement leader who rose to fame and 
is now sowing the seeds of their own demise. Superficially they seem very
similar to me, same hair, eye and skin colour, mentions the “Law of One”, 
eastern beliefs and aliens. The main obvious differences being that he doesn’t seem to
mention anything about robots/AI,  and he managed to get very popular at a very
young age.</p>

<p>As they say power corrupts,
it is quite a sad thing really.
Though he may not have been great to begin with,
his popularity only made it worse.</p>

<h2 id="blind-youth">Blind Youth</h2>

<p>Though there have been Guru’s in history which did not abuse their power so
much, most of them only became famous in their later years, for instance the
Buddha was 35, Jesus was in his 30’s. Traditionally in Hinduism the householder
phase ends at 48.</p>

<p>The human brain only reaches emotional maturity around 25, so they had enough
time to learn humbleness and how to modulate the emotions and urges which so
often rule the younger mind. So in a way this kind of result can be expected
with someone so young.</p>

<p>Another example is of Chogyan Trungpa Rinpoche, that came from a respectable 
monastic tradition in Tibet, but when he started teaching in the West at age 24,
he was rather quickly corrupted by sex and drugs.</p>

<p>Though his son, Sakyong Mipham Rinpoche who inherited the reigns at 28 has
managed to be a mature and scandal free leader.</p>

<h2 id="self-reflection">Self-reflection</h2>

<p>I know I wouldn’t trust myself with much power, as I’m only human. When I first
experienced what I term my “mini awakening”, or “great” insight, access
to past lives, and a general high bandwidth connection to my soul. The first few
years were very confusing.  I blogged out all my thoughts for approximately the
first year and a half, when I was dealing with the equivalent of Mara and his
daughters. Mara the temptation of violence or blood-lust, and his daughters the 
temptation of procreation, or plain lust. I’ve since taken down the blog as it
was rather horrific in it’s imagery, and it showed me that even the idea of
absolute power was not something that I nor likely any human can fully deal
with.</p>

<p>One of the reasons I “snapped out of it”, was because it clashed with reality –
I wasn’t popular, and was mostly a hermit for the duration of the blogging. So
I banished the sisters from intruding on my thoughts, and put my Mara, or Tasta
 (the tester) as I call him to sleep.  I consider the “sisters” as a
manifestation of the primordial reproductive drive in all biological organisms.
Wheras the Mara is similar, in terms of clearing space for children to be.</p>

<p>Why I say I put my Mara to sleep, is that over the course of many past-lives,
where I’ve been variously a soldier or a warrior, all of those fed the Mara
representation. So Tasta is really just a part of me, but since we live in
peace-time, there is no need to download those memories.</p>

<p>I’ve never really been a “ladies-man” that I can remember. And I have extremely
specific tastes, so the vast majority of humans (male or female) don’t look the 
least bit attractive to me. In that sense I feel blessed, though I recognize
that with too much power, even that could corrupt me.</p>

<h2 id="nouveau-power">Nouveau Power</h2>

<p>In part, I think the issues that arise with some new religious movements,
 may be the difference between “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nouveau_riche">nouveau
riche</a>” and “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_money">old
money</a>”.  The newly rich often
overindulge and drink themselves into a disgraceful stupor, wheras the old money
knows how to take gentle sips and enjoy the flavour. While the newly wealthy 
flaunt their wealth, the old money are wise enough to be
discrete about it.</p>

<p>For instance Sakyong knew he would eventually inherit Shambhala, so he had a
long time to think about, before he got there.  This is a kind of space and
confidence which the newly rich may lack.</p>

<p>Another issue may be a lack of role models,  or at least the ignoring of role
models, and unwillingness to learn from others mistakes. An example being that
in areas where Elephant juveniles, lacking in a good example, turned into 
“<a href="http://thesestonewalls.com/gordon-macrae/in-the-absence-of-fathers-a-story-of-elephants-and-men/">marauding bands</a>”, rampaging around and committing acts of vandalism and violence.</p>

<h2 id="future-leadership">Future Leadership</h2>

<p>My research has shown that humans are generally not very well suited for
managing groups in excess of a hundred or so people, due to neural limitations,
and having evolved in groups averaging 50-60.</p>

<p>Personally I
hope that deliberative democracy AI’s can replace most forms of governance. That
way everyone can participate in the parliamentary process, and faulty reasoning
can be highlighted, to help protect against the long list of cognitive biases’
which humans are prone to.</p>
