<h3 id="profit-strategy">Profit Strategy</h3>

<p>International Supermarkets are already an establish market sector, 
That means it’s a “good idea”, and should be easy for most people to understand.</p>

<p>Most of the online freelancing businesses have been merged by a few central
players. 
However there are still many ways in which they can be better.
So the aim is both to make a better supermarket in general, 
and to have a niche of programming and robot civilization seeds.</p>

<p>There already exist comrade web supermarkets on NXT family of coins – and for
the creators have been quite profitable.  But for
established coins they are rather expensive to use, and is not viable for more
the relatively complex bidding for contracts, arbitration and  management that is common to
freelancing marketplaces.</p>

<h3 id="market-research">Market Research</h3>

<p>There is currently over 700 billion dollar per year spent on software
development in
<a href="https://www.ibisworld.com/industry-trends/international/china-market-research-reports/information-transmission-computer-services-software/software-development.html">China</a> alone,</p>

<h3 id="diversity-strategy">Diversity Strategy</h3>

<p>There are several advantages that Pyash affords us.</p>

<ul>
  <li>High precision Internationalization, allowing non-English speakers to buy and
sell products and services.</li>
  <li>Software producing Proof of Work, for generating new tokens, improving the
market, and working towards robot civilization seeds.</li>
  <li>Currency pegged to the price of a mega-joule of electricity.</li>
  <li>Supporting trade between independent sub-markets (that have their own
electricity prices) allowing for easy scaling.</li>
  <li>Support for intra-market censorship to allow for lawful use in polities with
product and service restrictions.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="use-case">Use Case</h3>

<p>Say you have a small city. This city like
many others wants to support the local economy.
Like many others it may be low on cash to invest in local infrastructure,
businesses and services.</p>

<p>This city has an average electricity cost of 18 cents per kilowatt, or 5 cents
per mega-joule, which sets the price per token.</p>

<p>The City also collects money from residents in the form of property-taxes, so
they can pay people with the tokens, so long as they accept them as payment for
property taxes – which makes them immediately redeemable.</p>

<p>However people can also use these tokens for buying products and services in the
local online marketplace. That means that more tokens can be generated than are
necessary to cover all property taxes.</p>

<p>This also gives incentive to the city to buy products and services from the
local community – instead of outsourcing, since they are the most likely to accept the tokens.</p>

<p>The local online marketplace may include various local retailers, and could be
used for buying local services and products 
in brick-and-mortar stores through a smart-phone
app.</p>

<p>All the products and services the local market provides, at the sellers option
can also be available for people searching from higher market levels.</p>

<p>So while the Pyash top-level market may be international, or eventually
inter-planetary, it can have nation sub-markets, and those can have provincial
sub-markets, and those can have county and city sub-markets.</p>
