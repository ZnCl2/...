<p>Many people seem to have strong feelings about the “Illuminati”, 
love ‘em or hate ‘em, people want to feel like someone is in control.</p>

<p>An Illuminati is kind of like a holding company, that manages other groups.
There is a game called “Illuminati: The Game of Conspiracy”, that illustrates
the basic functioning of an Illuminati group. There are typically two methods of
winning, one is to acquire some set large number of groups, and the second being
to accomplish a mission particular to that Illuminati group.</p>

<p>One of the issues I’ve run into with such groups, is that if you die, it can be
very hard to get back in. Also with secretive Illuminati groups, the chances of
being killed are significantly increased, either by outside groups, or by
internal competition. 
So I was thinking, how about we can make the Open Source Illuminati, accessible
to all?</p>

<p>In it, groups would join voluntarily, and could use some form of democracy to 
make decisions that would make things more impactful when all working as a whole. 
Somewhat like a union, or a union of unions.  The main part would be making the 
infrastructure to support it, that would have the democracy software to accept 
and manage the input of large number of people, so that it could be a global 
organization.</p>

<p>From my research, the Pirate Party seems to have some of the best democracy 
software available so far. Their software support liquid democracy.</p>

<p>However for a global spanning Illuminati that even takes into consideration the
insights of a five year old, we need some more serious software.</p>

<ol>
  <li>A language that can accept formal input from all the worlds languages and store 
it in a high precision intermediate format that can then be translated to other
human and computer languages.</li>
  <li>An automated professor to help people with understanding the parliamentary
procedure, and with formal way of composing sentences so they could be
understood by everyone. 
the professor could also point out any logical fallacies or cognitive biases
present in the arguments, to save the person embarrasment.</li>
  <li>An automated secretary that can record and summarize meetings, count votes,
and modify policy based on what has been agreed upon in a session. As well as
make the policy accessible to those that want or need to see it.</li>
  <li>An automated president that would accept the arguments from people of the
world, and output them in order, grouping/merging similar arguments, making
an output of the parliamentary session in all languages, so it is accessible to
everyone.</li>
  <li>An automated lawyer that can read through all the policies (statutary law) 
  and arbitration records (common law) and give suggestions about how to 
accomplish things, or which things are and are not allowed.  Or which policies 
would have to be changed to make something possible.</li>
  <li>An automated lobbyist, that would pressure nearby groups to make the
necessary policy changes to make things possible.</li>
</ol>

<p>This can be offered as a software for companies to manage their meetings more
effectively, and they wouldn’t even have to sit in a conference room anymore. 
This would be particularly useful for holding companies that have to manage a
large number of organizations,  so can consolidate the various meetings
together.</p>

<p>Governments and even families could use this software, since it is open source.
Allowing for a vertical integration that goes from top to bottom.</p>

<p>For instance the household lobbyist could lobby the local governments and
companies to be compatible with household policies.  Or the automated lawyer
could inform the household of any pending policies which may conflict with
household policy, so the household could decide if they want to send their
lobbyist in.</p>

<p>The OS Illuminati mission would otherwise be to promote cosmist robot 
civilization, so that humanity could spread to new eco-regions, such as deserts,
deep ocean, Luna, Mercury, Venus and Mars.</p>
