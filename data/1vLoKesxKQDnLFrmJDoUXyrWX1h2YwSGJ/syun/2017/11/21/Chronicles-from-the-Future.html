<p>A well known policy of the New World Order and Illuminati organizations is
``Hidden in Plain Sight’’.</p>

<p>The “<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27793847-chronicles-from-the-future?from_search=true">Chronicles From the Future</a>“(2016) book includes a plan for how the New World Order will nuclear holocaust 
Asia, Africa and Southern Europe (5+ billion people dead) to get rid of overpopulation, and separatists.
Considered a holy book amongst some free masons and potentially more nefarious organizations, it is written from the victor’s perspective, over a thousand years after the New
World Order succeeded in its genocidal plans.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>only until the mid-24th century of our own chronology were there still some
 “yellow pockets” scattered here and therein the vast territory of Asia, which is
 now inhabited by the French, Anglo-Saxons, Slavs and Latinos. I also saw that at
 the same time on the “black continent” it was tremendously rare for one to
 encounter any blacks.
 Fate was very cruel to these races and quite ironic as well, because while they
 had just ceased to be slaves and were emancipated politically in autonomous
 territories, the brutal attitude of their “old colonial oppressor”, who had
 meanwhile panicked by the “nightmare of the number,” returned to haunt them for
 another 150 years. The earth must have witnessed horrid atrocities of inhumanity
 after the 21st century, which lasted for hundreds of years. Ultimately, the
 black and yellow races, as well as all other races of Asia, paid the price with
 the termination of their own history on earth.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Chronicles from the Future: (the anniversary of the “big day” and the extinction of the races)</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>While the majority of the book is dedicated to describing a spiritually and
technologically primitive Judeo-Christian style paradise on Earth of the future,
 there are some buried paragraphs regarding how they made it happen.</p>

<p>The `<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27793847-chronicles-from-the-future?from_search=true">Chronicles From the Future</a>’ is allegedly a time-travel account from a man
named Paul Dinach that fell into a coma in the 1920’s and travelled to the year 3906. 
While this is contestable, what we do know is that the original manuscript
 was published by a high ranking freemason, after the manuscript had been in
circulation amongst the freemasons for decades. Even if it is a legitimate time
travel experience, various time travel projects (including Project Pegasus) have
 verified that there are many worlds, or many timelines – Hollywood circular
timeline narratives may be NWO programming to make you think theirs is the only
timeline.  So this story while 
bordering on plausible, is just one way things could go. What makes it dangerous
is that the New World Order freemasons have been circulating it for decades, and
may be trying to make it a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p>

<h2 id="new-world-order-free-masons-involvement">New World Order Free Masons involvement</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>The book was taken very seriously by the Masons, who did not want the 
information spread to a larger circle. They considered the book to be almost 
holy, containing wisdom about the future of humanity, and better kept only 
for the few.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Chronicles from the Future (Preface)</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>The masons had it from the 1920’s so almost a hundred years as of this writing.
(The accessible English version “Chronicles from the Future” was only published
in 2016.)
This text being popular amongst the NWO masons could help explain why Asians and
Africans are generally not invited to NWO events such as Bilderberg – because 
they are slated for extermination.</p>

<p>The book is sympathetic to the New World Order:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the new world order, saying that as the form of organisation of the 19th and 
20th centuries with the fully armed dominant nation states, which most 
positively led to holocausts and annihilation could not continue</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Chronicles from the Future (Eldrere: the four-century struggle for real
globalisation)</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>There was no need for extensive revolutions to take place in order for the new 
world order to be built on the ruins of the old regimes. To a large extent, 
pivotal international treaties were signed, and that was enough, at least initially.</p>

  <p>The new law and order followed more democratic paths since the days of the Pax
Romana, although it took a long time and several attempts to establish it. The
expectations of the proponents of the New Order were often wrong. Many were 
repeatedly persecuted before the New Order finally prevailed.</p>
  <blockquote>

<p>The pivotal international treaties may include the nuclear disarmament of the 
“coloured peoples”.</p>

<h2 id="how-the-coloured-races-were-exterminated">How the “coloured races” were exterminated</h2>

<p>The peoples bodies and minds were attacked by the west. Since you are
likely victim to the second, I’ll start with the first. Though the two work
together to engineer the downfall, as when the mind is sick, it can not tend to
the body.</p>

<h3 id="the-attack-on-the-body">The attack on the body</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>In the 21st century the UN or equivalent manages to take away all the
strongest weapons from “coloured races” and monopolizes warfare.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>There came times when the ancient law of the jungle defeated the principles of
early civilisation. The unfortunate coloured races were finding themselves in a
disadvantaged position in all the confrontations, despite their unparalleled
numerical superiority, because they once had faith in international laws and had
left their strongest weapons in the warehouse of a central federal authority,
that is, essentially in the hands of the whites, who always got the majority of
votes in global institutions. Another cause of their disadvantage was their
inability to effectively cope with new discoveries in the field of mass
destruction weapons and the “scientific” conduct of war.</p>

    <p>They delay until it is too late to implement birth control measures, to
appease the Christian church. (22nd century)</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>A terribly hazardous situation had now arisen: extensive famines had occurred,
mainly in the poorest nations in Asia and Africa, and millions of children 
were starving and dying, tormented by poverty. But even the industrialised 
countries of Europe had seen the shadow of malnutrition spreading over them. 
And because of that, social and political upheavals occurred frequently 
throughout the world.</p>

      <p>…</p>

      <p>The great evil had come as suddenly as a flood and to such an extent that no
one had predicted it. Any measure adopted each time gave the impression that
it had come too late. And then many scientists who worked on the issue of
demographic perspective were accused of incompetence and poor forecasting.
Then the public outcry was directed at the Roman Catholic and Protestant
Churches, because by “living in the clouds” and by insisting on the old
perceptions and the negative attitude, they had contributed to the failure to
timely legislate institutions for effective birth control and the monitoring
of demographics.</p>

    <p>When the starvation starts to affect the Judeo-Christian countries (likely by
increasing food prices), their populace grows apathetic to the rights of 
the “coloured people”. Giving them the resolve to exterminate them.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>And the days when the whites saw only the person behind the black and 
yellow skin and preached that “all men were created equal”, the days when 
white people had even gone into civil wars in order to enforce the principles 
of humanity and respect for life and freedom of every human being, regardless 
of their colour, now seemed like a dream…</p>

<h3 id="attack-on-the-mind">Attack on the mind</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Poisoned by consumerism, which attempts to quench spiritual thirst
with stuff, leading to selfishness, environmental destruction, and insanity.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>The “Western spirit” expanded in terms of territory, but also lost a large part
of its spirituality. It diffused everywhere, throughout the world, gradually
overpowering the unique attributes of each nation, like race or language, even
in the countries of the Far East. The Anglo-Saxons in general managed to impose
themselves on an international level with their currencies and their language,
and the North American confederation in particular took on responsibilities of
political influence around the world, to such an extent that no one could have
imagined at the beginning of the century</p>

      <p>Everybody was only interested in themselves. Love, straightforwardness, mercy
and forgiveness were all swept aside. Within a hard and wildly competitive
environment, the value or indifference to the means used by someone for the
purpose of attaining wealth was judged based solely on results and
effectiveness! The hesitations of conscience were considered as “lack of
common sense”! What prevailed was the thirst for power and domination and the
smothering of every reaction or emotion that arose by any means possible.</p>

      <p>Young people, who were then lacking even the basic moral values, said that “they
didn’t believe in anything” and, of course, the ones who were to blame were the
adults, who had left them alone, without a guide, to “find their own way.”</p>

      <p>At the same time came what was later to be called “the worthlessness of idols”,
meaning the observation that, in all parts of the world, young people had
started admiring “idols”—actors and mimes, boxers, footballers, scruffy,
longhaired musicians, courtesans and heartless tycoons</p>

      <p>As a result of the lack of faith in at least some ideals, people lost their
inner balance. The fall of ideals left a terrible void. People suddenly became
incapable of approaching a superior view of life and the world, a deeper
interpretation. The world of religion collapsed. A number of physicists argued
that the scientific knowledge had come to replace the “naïve faith” in good!</p>

      <p>But too much faith in the omnipotence of science did not solve any of the
problems humanity was facing, or at least those members of humanity that
deserved to be called humans, said Lain. In short, they said that problems
didn’t actually exist and that questions were posed in vain since there were no
answers. “Things are what they are” was their motto. In their view, life was an
irrational flow of sequential events, a completely random biological
evolutionary process without purpose, direction or reason.</p>

      <p>And there came times when this disappearance of all faith and metaphysical
havens, combined with the exhausting rhythm of life of the human-robot, resulted
in the appearance of distressing mental side effects on a grand scale: severe
neuropsychiatric disorders and extensive suicides and then a stage of nihilistic
self-abandonment prevailed for many years.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>Chronicles from the Future (the decline of the 20th and 21st century)</p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Also note that while the book blames science for causing consumerism, the
scientific method is independant of consumerism, which is a western ideology.
The scientific method can and is also be applied to spiritual matters, such as
meditation, hypnotic regression, and psychic phenomena. In fact
Quantum Information Theory points to the existence of a soul or mindstream,
while String Theory may allow for the existence of a soul world, see possible

    <p>In short the passage says that Western culture promotes Xiaoren</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Xiaoren: “Little person” (Chinese), a petty and selfish human being who is only
concerned with preserving his own interests. He is distinguished from the
“junzi,” who is cultured and acts for the good of others.</p>

    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Poisoned by consumerism, people are unable to reap the rewards of automation
and basic income.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>the automation of work, due to the electrical and electronic devices created 
a problem that was not visible to the naked eye: the workers’ extra free time!
In fact they argue that that self-determination given to the workers, mainly 
the industrial ones, was, according to many thinkers, one of the main reasons 
why human history and civilisation on earth took this course! Because that 
extra free time of the workers was filled with low-quality spectacles and 
entertainment in general, like gambling, prostitution, the speed races and 
sports games and vulgar popular mass media. Music was reduced to simple 
melodies and rhythms, the masterpieces of literature circulated in illustrated
summaries and thought was considered a waste of time!</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>The “Great Powers”, however, which had come to the fore in the 21st century,
were struggling to understand one another. There was constant winning and
complaints about the ways and criteria of the distribution of universal
income. No one ever believed that their share was fair…</p>

    <p>Since they can’t satiate their souls with stuff, but have enough time to realize
 they are missing something. Like the metaphorical hungry ghosts of Buddhist lore.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>The inhabitants of the Hungry Ghost Realm are depicted as creatures with
scrawny necks, small mouths, emaciated limbs and large, bloated, empty
bellies. This is the domain of addiction, where we constantly seek something
outside ourselves to curb an insatiable yearning for relief or fulfillment.
The aching emptiness is perpetual because the substances, objects or pursuits
we hope will soothe it are not what we really need. We don’t know what we
need, and so long as we stay in the hungry ghost mode, we’ll never know. We
haunt our lives without being fully present.</p>

  <li>
    <p>Brexit style separatists don’t want immigrants from overflowing countries,
and want to use their own currency.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>These “reactions” of the 21st century were meant to become the omen of the
future “separatist movements”, which erupted repeatedly and were incited by the
same “political nuclei” of the initial reactions! <em>The requests were the same</em>:
<em>demographic regulation and financial interests</em>… For four whole centuries,
sometimes the French or the Anglo-Saxons and other times the Germans or the
Slavs revolted for “autonomy”, all with the same objective: to take the lead,
from then on, in the historical course of mankind. “This fiery ordeal will
pass,” they said, meaning the war they themselves had started. “Whatever happens
is for your own good. The democrats are unable to give you the order that you
need…”</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Chronicles from the Future (the “fear factor” as an educational tool for the
young citizens)</p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>

    <p>The demographic fear maybe because their own genes are recessive, 
white people are afraid on a primal level of other ethnicities. With 
administrative software, it may be possible to give various racial purists, 
their own small polities or “islands”, where they can feel safe. That
way they are less likely to motivate whole countries or regions separating.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>When it comes to a paranoid man, it is better to control and tame him than
to go against him. The proper assessment of things did not escape those
paranoid leaders, who supported the doctrine of “action, not thought”,</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Chronicles from the Future (the “beasts” of history and the value of human
life)</p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>

    <p>While the financial interests could superficially be resolved with 
polity-level crypto-currencies, the underlying issue is the consumerism 
which makes people into ravenous hungry ghosts. So no matter how much money 
they are given, it wont be enough, because it’s not money they need, but 
food for their soul.</p>

    <p>The actions of the separatists eventually lead the UN or equivalent (which is
white dominated) to simply kill off what they fear most (other ethnicities).</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>And the economic wars were usually followed by armed conflicts. In the latter
they only used the old conventional weapon since the separatists had no access
to the “forbidden ones”, but this did not prevent those conflicts from evolving,
several times until the 24th century, into real, extensive wars with mass
casualties that threatened the universal federation with outright collapse every
single time.</p>

    <p>Legislators ignored peoples personal and-or spiritual needs, which led to
unsatisfied people that spent their time fighting their governments, much as 
how American culture teenagers fight their parents.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Technological advances had eliminated distances and had brought people very
close to one another. The world gave the impression of a single region, still
politically disorganised, waiting for the “legislators” and the powerful
politicians with global authority to permanently lay down the rules for the
“organisation” of the planet. At the same time, man now had weapons of mass
destruction in his control, unknown and inexistent in earlier times. The rapid
technological acme, however, was not in line with the corresponding moral
maturity and rationality. There was no “internal law”, a law of spiritual
culture like the one they have now, which was needed as a guarantor of law and
order.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Chronicles from the Future (eldrere: the four-century struggle for real
globalisation)</p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Note that “seperation of church and state” of American culture is largely
illusory. The presidents are always going to Church, urging people to pray,
and being swayed by their policies.</p>

    <p>It is better to define a spiritual basis for a nation, than to leave it up to
chance.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="the-new-world-order-paradise">The New World Order Paradise</h2>

<p>To add insult to injury, they also blamed their own terrible act on the Asians.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Wars didn’t come naturally. They were artificially created by their bad and 
unworthy leaders along with the weapon manufacturers, mainly Asian. 
They pushed peoples towards hatred and mutual extermination. It is fortunate 
that our species managed to prevail. The risk was fatal.</p>

<h3 id="nwo-paradise-spirituality">NWO Paradise Spirituality</h3>

<p>Because they decided to throw away most Eastern faiths, their own religion is
extremely shallow, like that of the Freemasons. They simply believe in pantheism
 and that it is not possible to understand.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We, the human creatures with the short-lived biological destiny, come and go.
The dimension of depth eludes us. Our antennas have a very limited capacity.
They only form subjective impressions that are totally irrelevant to the true
and objective “Great Reality”, the Samith as he called it.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Chronicles from the Future (August 25th)</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>One of the pinnacles of their spiritual achievement after hundreds of years of 
development is the ability to appreciate things
in the present moment — which is the most common form of meditation in
Buddhism. But since there were no Asians left, it took them centuries to figure
it out on their own.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Even the changes of weather make a huge impression on them and become a topic
of conversation. A phenomenon as simple as the change of seasons is a great
source of happiness for them. And if you tell Stefan that the people of his
era have rather lost their grip on reality, he won’t admit it. “It’s
unbelievable,” he told me, “how much potential happiness is hidden in our
inner world. You had no idea about it in your time, but just because we can’t
grasp it doesn’t mean it is non-existent. The sensors of our souls have been
dulled and are no longer adequate receivers. So all these things that you view
as strange, who is to say that they are childish instead of divine?”</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Chronicles from the Future (Southern Europe)</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>The pinnacle being the Nibelvirch, a loose equivalent to Judeo-Christian 
rapture, which is equivalent to the second Jhana in Buddhism. Though since they 
exterminated all the Asians, it takes them about 700 years to get to it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There it is! There’s the amazing flame,
that made everything sparkle!
You can finally see it from up here!
After a climb of centuries,
through countless tribulations,
we finally reached the top,
and we can see it from up here!</p>

  <p>That’s what happened back then in the Valley—what is now considered as “the
greatest event in human history”. It was followed by the unprecedented
preaching: “Something exists, something so great that it’s impossible to grasp
it with our human minds, something so great that the mere expectation of it
will be enough to fill the world with endless happiness!”</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Chronicles from the Future (Sylvia’s World View)</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Second Jhana: Joy</p>

  <p>You proceed from the first jhana to the second by keeping a balanced mind with
no clinging to the pleasant nature of the first jhana. Then you shift your
attention from the physical pleasure to emotional pleasure. The pleasurable
sensations, if any, get put to the background and calm the mind further. You
feel a great joy in your meditation and keep one-pointedness of mind.</p>

  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>It took them so long because they don’t meditate, so it came from a genetic
mutation.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Either way, Dienach writes that the Nibelvirch inaugurates a brand new stage in
the evolution of the spiritual life of the human race. This new superior
spiritual ability and knowledge potential is, he says, a frontier, a limit
separating the Homo sapiens’ life, which lasted millennia, from the dawning of a
new life for the enlightened man, the Homo Occidentalis Novus. Besides, he
writes that he heard it said that anatomic variations had been observed in the
main connective brain centres afterwards.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Chronicles from the Future (translator’s preface to the first edition (1972)
of the valley of the roses)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The scope of the cognitive capabilities of humans expanded, something that
allowed the Homo Occidentalis Novus to see the Samith and accept its
existence.</p>

<p>Nowadays seeing and accepting the “Samith” or feeling at one with the infinity
of everything is merely the 6th Jhana.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Sixth Jhana: Infinity of Consciousness
You enter the sixth jhana by realizing that the infinite space you occupy
includes your consciousness. So you shift your attention to infinite
consciousness instead of infinite space. You may feel “at one” with all nature
and existence, but do not be fooled, this is not full enlightenment.
Concentration is further increased and there is still one-pointedness of mind.</p>

<p>The paradise described in the book uses almost exclusively pre-information age
technology (there is no internet, no AI, and no robots).<br />
This may be in part because all the chip manufacturers were destroyed in the
holocaust.
But probably also to make it more difficult for people to see past the
deception, and co-ordinate any alternative world views.</p>

<h2 id="steps-to-avoid-extermination">Steps to avoid extermination</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Don’t be an American Hungry Ghost that tries to feed their soul with stuff.
Feed your soul with knowledge, relationships, culture and meditation.</li>
  <li>Discover what your mission is on Earth, and-or join a beneficial one.</li>
  <li>Don’t give your strongest weapons to foreigners, or globalists.
Be at least strong enough, to be unappetizing to big cats..</li>
  <li>Figure out how many people your country can sustain and house based on your 
local food production and space. Then either improve food production<br />
and-or establish birth quotas, so that you can live within your means.</li>
  <li>Realize that studies show Urban people are always less happy than rural
people, and that Urban centers don’t make food. Allow and incentivize people
to move to deserts and turn them into food forests. NWO and Agenda 21 
may motivate Urban centers because they are easier to nuke.</li>
  <li>Integrate an “internal law” of some kind, that ensures that people can feed
their soul with learning, relationships, meditation and other proven things
to help the people be happy.</li>
  <li>Change the voting system of the UN to be based on number of
people represented, rather than a one country one vote system. If that
doesn’t work could make an alternative international Union that does respect 
population. One which is not headquartered in a racist white nation.
Originally the plan was to have the UN headquarters on a floating platform or
cruiseship that traveled the world,  this idea may be worth revisiting.</li>

<h3 id="compassion">Compassion</h3>

<p>While I know you may have some unkind feelings to Freemasons and the 
New World Order. Remember that many freemasons don’t know about this, and maybe
even many low level NWO members aren’t aware of these plans. Of course we
should be nothing but grateful to the man that published this book for us to 
see. Let us remember one of the central teachings of the Buddha:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hatred never ceases by hatred,
But by love alone is healed.
This is an ancient and eternal law.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Chant of Buddhist Temple in Khmer Rouge refugee camp.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Hatred lead to separatists and non-compliance and it was separatists and 
countries not being able to feed the people with food from
within their own borders (overpopulation) is the excuse they used to
holocaust the “coloured people”.</p>

<p>Bare your teeth, and gleefully they will pull the trigger of their multi
trillion dollar military industrial complex. Hatred is what they want. Love and
hate, both focus on them.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>2.14 The Master said: The junzi is inclusive and  not a partisan;<br />
the  small  man  is  a  partisan and not inclusive.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Analects of Confucius <a href="http://www.indiana.edu/~p374/Analects_of_Confucius_(Eno-2015).pdf">PDF</a></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Instead remember yourself, your family, your community, your culture, your
history. Many Eastern religions are rich with content to feed the soul, Buddhism
and Yoga being prime examples.  Of course I mean the full yoga, with the yamas,
niyamas and all the rest, not just asana’s as the West may have led you to
believe.</p>

<p>China is an Atheist nation, which is fine. Though perhaps now that they have
experimented with consumerist atheism,  they will see the wisdom in 
Buddhist atheism, Confucius’s recommendations and the goals of Daoism.</p>

<p>One possible way of addressing the primal xenophobia that white people
experience due to their genetic recessiveness and replace the Illuminati, 
would be to use governance software that is open to all, and allows a very fine
level of granularity. An example of this idea is <a href="http://liberit.ca:43110/1vLoKesxKQDnLFrmJDoUXyrWX1h2YwSGJ/syun/2017/11/18/Open-source-illuminati.html">Open Source
Illuminati</a>.</p>

<p>Diversity is intertwined with adaptive capacity: the ability of an eco-system
to withstand large changes. By allowing legal islands for recessive genotypes
to live, it allows for greater diversity – and removes the primal fear that
drives them to violence from fear of extinction. While at the same time
enriching the eco-system and adaptive capacity of Earth.</p>

<h2 id="strengthen">Strengthen</h2>

<p>In Asia, people are generally comfortable with robots, but in the West people are
generally afraid of them. This may mean that robots and Artificial Intelligence
can tip the world in favour of Asia.</p>

<p>You may be wondering why I (a white person) care so much about Asia – though
Africa deserves to live to. 
It is a heavy weight to bear, to know that 5+ billion people may die if you do
not notify them about the danger that lies ahead. At this point, inaction is
just as bad as aiding the NWO in their plans. So anyone who still has a moral
compass should be doing at least something to help prevent the greatest genocide
in history from happening.</p>

<p>Also I am a Buddhist, by combining
Buddhist meditation and hypnotic regression, I have recovered some of my past 
lives. I discovered that I first became a Buddhist about a thousand years ago in
the Himalayas, and spent around 400 years in the region that is now called
China.</p>

<p>So I feel a great affinity to East-Asian people, culture, religions and customs. 
It was always just more fulfilling and satisfying than the Abrahamic faiths
(Judaism, Christianity, Islam). In other lives I’ve been killed enough times by
Abrahamic faith peoples for my beliefs to take their genocidal threats seriously.
Seeing an East-Asian person often makes me smile with warm memories.</p>

<h3 id="robotic-civilization-seeds">Robotic Civilization Seeds</h3>

<p>In fact if Asia is destroyed and Robot Civilization is not available, 
I’m going to leave the solar system and incarnate somewhere else.</p>

<p>I’ll be honest with you, my mission here on Earth is to form Robot Civilization
Seeds.<br />
The Dalai Lama agrees that reincarnating into robots is <a href="http://www.alamut.com/subj/ideologies/buddhism/and_AI.html">compatible with
Buddhism</a>, as does
Integrated Information Theory (<a href="http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003588">IIT</a>) and Quantum Information Theory (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0306044">QIT</a> (<a href="/1vLoKesxKQDnLFrmJDoUXyrWX1h2YwSGJ/dlim/2017/10/30/Unifying-QIT-IIT-and-MT.html">integration link</a>).
With RCS we can take Asian, African and maybe even Western culture, religion 
and souls/mindstreams to other planets and beyond. Such civilization seeds not only provide
robot host-bodies, but could also provide environment bubbles for humans to live
in.</p>

<p>Then even if the worst comes, and against all odds the NWO prevails in it’s
extermination plans, we will have an out. East-Asians may be smarter than
Whites, but being smart doesn’t necessarily stop the man with a three trillion 
dollar club from smashing your head in.</p>

<p>Asia has over 80\% of Science, Technology, Engineering and Math graduates in the
world. Even a small percenatge of them working together should be able to 
fix demographic and “inner life” issues, while achieving 
Robot Civilization Seeds as a backup before time runs out.</p>

<p>I believe Asia is the best suited to make RCS, as the center
of manufacturing, robotics, AI and technology.  This year Japan began
deep-sea-mining operations, which is a pivotal technology that can make Robot
Civlization Seeds resistent to conventional nuclear holocaust. Though such
civilization seeds would be safer on the moon or other planets, the deep ocean 
is probably sufficiently difficult to access, and bombs aren’t as effective in 
the high pressure.</p>

<p>Whilte robotic civilization seeds may be a long way away, one of the current
projects that supports open access to AI is
<a href="https://singularitynet.io/">SingularityNet</a>.  They have their head office in
Asia (Hong Kong), and their biggest office in Africa (Ethiopia).</p>
