<p>In recent years we’ve been witnessing increasing extremism in North American
Politics, largely as a result of the First-Past-The-Post (FPTP) electoral system
where “winner takes all”. This has led to a two-party or bipolar political
climate, which is spiraling into ever increasing extremes, instead of coming
together in the middle.</p>

<p>Obama may still have been a relatively moderate president, but even he undid
some of the bills that were implemented by the former president. Trump is
probably the first obviously extreme president, of the right-leaning type.
Though in future we may see a left-leaning extremist president that will replace
the Trump era.</p>

<p>It is a similar story in Canada, where Harper was a right-leaning politician
that became more extreme as time went on, gagging environmental scientists and
supporting the destruction of the environment much as Trump does now. He was
replaced by a relatively extreme Liberal or left-leaning politician, though
still fairly moderate, and may end up being remembered somewhat like Obama is
now. We could consider Canada to be roughly an electoral cycle behind America.</p>

<p>I must admit that I being left-leaning myself am somewhat biased towards the
left, and blind to some of the problems right-leaning people may see with
left-leaning policies. So perhaps it would be easier for them to point out
increased  extremism in the left.</p>

<p>With this increasing spiral of extremism we are no longer countries where our
leaders pull us forward, but increasingly the leaders are pulling us to one of
the sides, (either the left or the right), undoing the progress of the other.</p>

<p>Based on my observations I think FPTP will lead to the collapse of North America.</p>

<p>FPTP promotes spiraling extremism where governments progressively rock the boat more and more, eventually it will capsize.</p>

<p>right now, America and Canada are on Stage 4 of 5 (grasping for a saviour) 
based on ‘<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6431063-how-the-mighty-fall?from_search=true">how the mighty fall</a>’ (by Jim Collins). 
Due to the ]Seneca effect](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34639288-the-seneca-effect?ac=1&amp;from_search=true), 
we know that since the demise is so evident now that it likely will collapse happen fairly soon. 
If trends continue I guesstimate there are maybe two or three more 
presidents/prime ministers that can be squeezed out of FPTP 
before North America capitulates, w/e that means for a nation.</p>

<p>That’s not to say that of course that demise and international irrelevance is 
inevitable, electoral reform is possible.  I know in Canada the federal 
government was making some noise about it, but never actually did anything. <br />
Hopefully capitulation will simply mean capitulation to another electoral 
policy that doesn’t lead to the countries 
ripping themselves apart.</p>

<p>Germany lived through a fairly similar experience, where they were grasping for
saviour and found Hitler. Just like Italy found Mussolini, Russia found Lenin,
and China found Mao. Now many decades later and millions of lives they are doing
alright. Hopefully we can avoid the millions of lives lost.</p>

<p>If anyone here does drawing/comics, could probably draw something with an 
elephant and a donkey on either side pulling the country apart with lots of 
cracks and such.  Then could have an image of a coalition government with 
multiple parties that have to pull together to make the country go forward. 
I guess in this example a country would be a cart.</p>
