My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2483069363">5 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
This is a very dense book, full of exciting ways of improving ones life using computer science insights. <br />Here is a quick summary of the chapters:<br /><br />1. Optimal Stopping: When to stop looking?<br />After you’ve seen 37% of the candidates.<br /><br />2. Explore/Exploit: The Latest vs the Greatest<br />When lots of time then can explore for new options, <br />when less time can exploit or make use of what has already been discovered.<br />Young people tend to be more exploration heavy, <br />and older people more exploitation heavy,<br />but it all depends on perception, <br />if young person told they have short time to live they exploit,<br />and if old person told they have long time to live they explore. <br /><br />Again, when do you decide on what park to frequent? <br />When you’ve explored 37% of the ones in your area.<br /><br />3. Sorting: Making order<br /><br />Covers various sorting methods, IIRC concludes one of the best (for clothing) is batch sort, <br />where you break up a large pile into small piles, and sort those.<br /><br />4. Caching: Forget about it<br /><br />Is about how can avoid having to sort clothes at all, <br />simply by having a caching system, <br />where most recently used clothing goes in laundry bin or dresser near bed,<br />if that bin is full, the clothing that is least likely to be used gets put in closet. <br />if the closet is full then the least likely to be used clothing gets put in basement,<br />and so-on, using the hierarchy of caches. <br /><br />Can do it for other things, like tools, cutlery, files. <br />Best way to sort files is based on most recently used first. <br /><br />5. Scheduling: First Things First<br /><br />To get the most done, do the shortest length item first.<br />To avoid procrastination divide item length based on it’s weight/importance.<br />To avoid priority inversion, if a low importance task must be completed before<br />a high importance task can get started, then it inherits the high priority.<br /><br />6. Baye’s Rule: predicting the future<br /><br />There is a simple formula for probability, called Laplace’s Law:<br />number of successes plus one divided by number of attempts plus two. <br />probability=(successes+1)/(attempts+2).<br /><br />7. Overfitting: When to Think Less<br /><br />When you have a very little information about something <br />then should keep things simple. <br /><br />Or the complexity of your plan/approach should correspond <br />to the amount of information you have (probably &lt;37%).<br /><br />Cross-validate with new information, and penalize complexity.<br /><br />8. Relaxation: Let it slide<br /><br />Talks about how certain problems are intractable in their strict form,<br />however if we simplify the constraints then can make a solution,<br />this allows for finding out something approaching the ideal.<br /><br />9. Randomness: When to leave it to chance. <br /><br />For certain problems using randomness achieves as good or faster results<br /> as more deterministic approaches. <br /><br />The idea is to take random samples of a complex organization to get a picture of what is going on.<br />Also in terms of making something can use several randomized prototypes.<br /><br />With Simulated Annealing can lower the amount of randomness in each prototype as you get closer to the goal.<br /><br />10. Networking: How We Connect<br /><br />Mostly talks about computer network protocols, <br />with a few suggestions about how to apply them to life.<br /><br />11. Game Theory: The Minds of Others<br /><br />Mentions that the common prisoners dilemma is mostly a problem of how the game is designed,<br />and that with a different design the prisoners could be expected to co-operate. <br />Such as if they had a Godfather who made it quite clear the snitch would die.<br /><br />Concludes that it’s best to play games rigged for honesty. <br /><br />12. Computational Kindness<br /><br />Talks about how it’s important to think of the cognitive load you are putting on people,<br />for example that it’s better to say what you want rather than politely deferring,<br />since simulating what someone else wants is a massive cognitive load. <br /><br /><br />In Conclusion this is a great book, usually I just get the ebooks, <br />but with this book I also ordered a hard copy for my bookshelf.
