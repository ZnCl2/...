<p><em>Unidentified visitor approaching</em> flashed the augmented reality set. 
<em>You and four others are within 200meters, 
Approach for identification, reward 20 credits.</em> Andrew turned his head in the
direction his glasses were indicating. Seeing at least one other also turning in
the same direction.  He saw a tall figure with a gray overcoat and large hat
striding down the road into town.</p>

<p>“ksap”, Andrew whispered into headset. 
<em>mission accepted, credits held in escrow</em>, the others that had also been
looking at the approaching figure turned back to their work and kept going, having
been notified that he had accepted. He started walking towards the visitor.</p>

<p>Andrew had just come off a shift checking on a weather station positioned on a
mountainside. He was wearing an exoskeleton suit to help him climb safely. 
Some birds had decided to nest next to the weather station. After some deliberation
with the hive instead of moving it, they decided to use the wires to setup a 
webcam to monitor the progress of the birds. Having finished, and still dressed
and face painted in camo to avoid scaring the birds, striding in his exosuit 
he was heading home.</p>

<p>Having a quick 20 credits on the walk home, and an
opportunity to welcome a visitor. This day was looking up.</p>

<p>As he approached the visitor his mounted cameras continued analysis. 
<em>Visitor cadence indicates a relaxed attitude. 
Approach with authority, you are acting as security</em>
Andrew straightened his back and elbows, mimicing a toy soldier,
though he couldn’t help smiling to himself. He was feeling giddy with roleplay.</p>

<p>The visitor noticed him approaching and slowed turning towards him. With the
improved angle and proximity there were more readings.  <em>Appearance male, late
50’s. Cowboy hat, appears to be frowning.</em>  The man rested his hand on his hip.
<em>May be armed, slow down and approach with caution</em>.</p>

<p>Andrew noticed his heart rate and blood pressure meters rise in his lower left
hand corner. Andrew wasn’t armed, all he had were a few electronic tools in his
belt.</p>

<p><em>Cowboy boots detected, activating backup security bots. Your payment has been
completed. Your choice, salute or evade the visitor.</em> “nglam.” Andrew typed
with his fingers.</p>

<p><em>Suggested greeting: Howdy</em>. Andrew thought he’s add a little flourish
  “Howdy, there partner. Long time no see.”<br />
<em>Perceived expression: shock. Anger. Alert! Danger!</em> Andrew’s glasses started
flashing red, he started moving back.</p>

<p>The man pulled out a gun, and pointed it point blank at Andrew’s chest. “You
ain’t no friend of mine. You’re not even human.” He pulled the trigger. The last
thing Andrew remembered was blaring request for autopilot override “ksap” he
mouthed as his knees buckled.</p>

<p>–</p>

<p>“Andrew, wake up. You’re all patched up now.” Andrew opened his eyes, to see a
woman looking into his eyes and smiling.  It was their on-site doctor, she still
had her surgical exosuit on.</p>

<p>“You’re a hero.” said a small voice beside his bed.  He craned over to have a
look, but his neck still hurt for some reason. In fact he didn’t feel all that
great. Very tired. But he could see it was his daughter peering at him over the
bedside.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” Andrew asked her, looking up and seeing his wife behind her.</p>

<p>The doctor explained, “You may have averted a mass shooting, the man was later
confirmed to have a couple machine guns and enough ammo to put a bullet in each
of us twice.
When you engaged the autopilot, the exoskeleton used it’s
extensive understanding of martial arts to neutralize the visitor. And then ran
you over to sickbay.” Andrew looked down at his hands, they seemed undamaged.
Didn’t think he had it in him to do any martial arts himself.  Maybe he’d
notice some other sprains if was a particularly flexible martial form.</p>

<p>“Is he okay?” Andrew inquired. He didn’t want to have caused the man serious
injury.</p>

<p>“Yes, he’s fine, he just had a nasty bump on the head. May wake up with a concussion.
He’s in restraints in another room under guard until the police show up to take him away.”</p>

<p>Andrew noticed his wife had her hand over his. He gave it a good squeeze. They
met eyes and smiled.  “It’s good to be home.”</p>
