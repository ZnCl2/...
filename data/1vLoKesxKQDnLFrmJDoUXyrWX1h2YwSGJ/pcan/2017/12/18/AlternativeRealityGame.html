<p>A long-play ARG, which is actually the gameification of the creation of
 and alternative reality or Robot Civilization Seeds.</p>

<p>A play may be:</p>

<p>A freelancing teen clicks on an ad for a company that pays in
megajoule pegged micropayments for small AI training and programming
tasks on their smartphone. They download their app and for a while
enjoy solving captchas and labeling data for pay in their free time.</p>

<p>As they level up the data gets more complex but also weirder. “I mean
sure, I told them I was majoring in geology. But why am I labeling all
these wet core drill samples, and where are they coming from?” they
think to themselves.  The language at the higher levels also seems to
inexplicably devolve with seemingly bad grammar, even if still easy to
understand.</p>

<p>They notice some other people online speaking in a similar way, and
start to dig a little deeper.  It turns out they are all using some
kind of machine-readable inter-language. On the forums/group of other
freelancers that work for the same company, they find out that they
can get better pay, if they make their classification responses in the
language,  as then the linguistics-majors don’t have to do the
translating. So they learn the ins and outs of the language and get an
extra percentage pay on their data labeling and analysis.</p>

<p>They keep seeing on the newsfeeds about job automation, life without
work, and all the people that can’t seem to manage even with UBI.
They also hear rumours of alternative UBI communities setting up in
rural areas, but people pass them off as cults and weirdos. The legal,
philosophy and theology majors are always getting into heated yet
surprisingly civil debate threads on the forums. They keep using that
language, and congratulate each other at the end on money well made.</p>

<p>On their 18th birthday or when they graduate/drop-out, they get an
invitation in their app to join a full time working community. They
think about all the homeless drug addicts they see on the streets,
people begging on the streets in business suits and decide it may be
for the best.  After they click yes they fill out a questionaire about
what their ideal community setting is, rural, urban, forest, jungle,
seaside or mountains. They pick seaside.  The app gives them a route
plan, showing which bus route is optimal, and gives them a bonus to
pay for the tickets.</p>

<p>They mull it over for a while, and try to find out what they can about
the location they are going to.  It’s a small hamlet on the west
coast, in a rural area, on the side of a mountain, in the depths of a
fjord.</p>

<p>It had a seasonal access road, and the nearest bus stop was in a nearby city. He
figured he could just grab a self-driving taxi to go the last mile once he got
there.</p>

<p>There were two companies that had branches setup there,  one in aquaponics, and
one in deep sea mining.  The deep sea mining branch is the address he was given. 
He told his parent he found a job on the west coast,  they were surprised but
grateful and wished him well. So he got on the bus with his few belongings.</p>

<hr />

<p>While he was in transit his app chirped and asked if he was on the way. Having
confirmed, he was informed there would be someone there to greet him and take
him the rest of the way. As he got off the bus, he was momentarily stunned by
the tall mountains surrounding this little town, then he saw an old hatchback,
 and a man with and augmented reality headset waving to him. He brought his 
backpack along.</p>

<p>He approached the man and said “Hi, I’m Bryan.” 
“Nice to meet you, I’m Carl.  Here you’ll want these, so don’t have to repeat
this later.” Carl pulled out an augmented reality set from the backseat and
handed them to Bryan while taking his backpack.</p>

<p>Bryan put on the AR glasses and looked around.  Immediately he saw labels
floating above the streets with the street names, and a big bus terminal sign
hangning above the bus terminal.   He looked at the people streaming in and out.
Many were unidentified,  but others had their usernames, roles and levels 
floating above them.  He was surprised to see how many people were playing .</p>

<p>He turned back to Carl, and saw he was a high level logistics expert, with a
side branch in human relations. Carl had finished packing and came back around. 
“You know how to open a door, right? Get in.” Carl said.</p>

<p>Bryan slightly stunned still really from the AR, opened the door, got in and put
on this seatbelt. After a little while on paved streets the road turned to
gravel. The mountains rose on either side as they went down a slope to the
hamlet. He could hear the soft crunch of gravel in the tires, and the car slowed
down.</p>

<p>“Do you take neural-link nanobots?” Carl asked, holding out a handful of Grey 
capsules. The car was driving itself, though Carl was sitting at the wheel.</p>

<p>Bryan’s eyebrows rose, and his lips scrunched up. He wasn’t sure how he felt
about them.</p>

<p>“It’s alright, you’ll need a way of interfacing with the goggles beyond just
speech. Have these keyboard gloves instead.” He handed them to Bryan.</p>

<p>Bryan inspected them, they were clean, tough breathable material. Bryan had
heard of these before. A fancier version was advertized for high-end business
people and anyone that didn’t want to constantly be carrying a smart phone
around.</p>

<p>“Once you bond them to your AR set, it’ll start you up on a tutorial. we still
have a while to go.” Bryan put them on and started the tutorial.  The next thing
he knew they were arriving.</p>

<p>It looked like a small encampent at first. But the AR goggles were just going
wild pointing out all the IoT devices embedded into the mountain side. Weather
stations, webcams, micro hydro-power plants, wireless beacons and drone pads.</p>

<p>“It’s a pretty steep encampent. The flimsy stuff is up here.  Down closer to the
water, all the buildings are submersible, with the ocean rising as it is, wont
be too long before they are underwater. Though some already are, we put them
there.” Carl said, taking back the wheel as they cruised into a parking spot.
“From here we walk”.</p>

<p>Bryan got out and saw a line of exoskeletons, and a man carrying somethings down
the hill.  Through his AR glasses he could see that some of the other
exoskeletons were remotely operated by people in VR environments.</p>

<p>Bryan thought back fondly to how he had been one of those before. It was
simplified of course, there was no need to show the VR any more detail than
necessary, but it was nevertheless quite interesting.  His exoskeleton was back
in the bags, as he had to wear it to particpate.  He remembered his mother
complaining saying maybe he should stop pretending and move some bales of hay
instead with his fancy suit.   She didn’t seem to understand that he was helping
 pay the bills through his remote construction work. Though he did also use the
exo-suit to move some bales of hay. He loved his mom, but she had remarried and
sold the farm to moved in with her new lover. Now he was striking out on his
own.</p>

<p>One of the Exobots stopped momentarily as the driver vacated it, stopping the
procession,  auto-pilot took over.  The movements changed from a human gait, to
a more formal one, tuned to efficiency and precision.  Bryan wondered if they
really needed humans to help, or if it was merely momentum keeping them in
synch.</p>

<p>Carl and Bryan followed the procession down. On the way his AR unit printed
<em>Immigrant analysis complete. You’ve been authorized for on-site living quarters. 
Would you prefer floating,
submersbile, or underground homestead arrangment?</em> Bryan was slightly taken
aback.  He didn’t realize that it had taken this long for him to be processed,
or that he may have been denied housing here.</p>

<p>“Carl, what kind of housing do you have?” Bryan asked.</p>

<p>Carl turned back looked him up and down and nodded. “I’m going off shift now.
So I’ll just tell you as a comrade. Floating,  I have a need
for speed my boy.  them sailing trimarans may not be the loftiest option, but it
sure is nice taking a nap while sailing at fifty kilometers and hour.” he
laughed to himself like it was some big joke. He leaned onto the side of the
mountain, and looked down,centering himself. “For you though, I’d recommend a
submersible.  You’re a quiet type, seem to keep to yourself.  Once you take your
sub underwater the whole world quiets down, and it’s just you, the fish and the
aquabots.” He paused breathing the cool, fresh mountain air. “I reckon you’d
like to see where those core samples come from. If you have a submersible, you
could move there if you want.” Carl turned, and continued making his way down to
the docks.</p>

<p>Bryan stood there, thinking about those wet core samples. He was a geologist, so
underground would have made sense to him. But he was so curious, where are the
samples coming from? He noticed during his day dream, the Carl had gotten quite
ahead. Bryan hurried down, holding the railing tightly as he went.</p>

<p>“Carl, Carl, wait.” he said, catching up to Carl. “Where do the core samples
come from?”. he said catching his breath.</p>

<p>Carl laughed,  he laughed so hard he held onto the railing.<br />
“Well I guess you’ll find out.”</p>
