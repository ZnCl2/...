<p>An <a href="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/boring-investors-guide-cryptocurrency-investing/">article</a>
 about what to look for in a cryptocurrency for investment was found. The layout
is followed for LiberIT family of technologies.</p>

<p>THINGS TO THINK ABOUT BEFORE INVESTING
◹THE PROBLEM</p>
<blockquote>What problem are they addressing?</blockquote>
<p>The long-term problem  LiberIT is addressing is the providing electronic bodies
to take advantage of the large amount of real-estate not safely habitable by
homo-sapiens.</p>

<p>The short-term problem LiberIT is addressing is the low number of people that
can communicate with computers (future host-bodies) fluently.</p>

<blockquote> Why is it important to solve this problem?</blockquote>
<p>For the long-term it is for maximizing the amount of habitable space in both
this solar system and beyond.</p>

<p>For the short-term it is important for people to be able to fluently communicate
with computers because computers are growing in the workforce, and within the
next century there may be more cognitive power in the computer workforce than
the human workforce.</p>

<blockquote>How important is solving this problem?</blockquote>
<p>People may be willing to pay large sums of money for new and high quality
bodies, much more than for education, or even houses.  Having bodies with access
to new real-estate can also greatly increase their value.</p>

<p>For anyone that wants to stay relevant in the future where computers take
increasing number of roles, it is essential to be able to communicate with them
fluently.</p>

<p>◹THE SOLUTION</p>
<blockquote>What is their proposed solution to the problem? </blockquote>
<p>For the long-term it is to make a project specific cryptocurrency that will be
doled out sparringly for completion of various elements moving towards the goal
of colonizing all electronics-compatible eco-regions of the solar-system.</p>

<p>For the short-term the proposed solution is Pyash, a programming language based
on linguistic universals (features in common to the majority of human
languages), that is also geared for GPU processing and automated programming.</p>

<blockquote>Are there other solutions to this problem?</blockquote>
<p>For the long-term, the primary alternative is creating artificial habitats for
homo-sapiens in eco-regions that are hostile to their existence.</p>

<p>For the short-term the primary alternative is the use of a  babel of
context-free programming languages, such as C, Javascript, HTML, SQL among a
multitude of others.</p>

<blockquote>Why is this solution better than other solutions at addressing the
problem?</blockquote>
<p>For the long-term, having electronic bodies which are compatible with the
eco-region is better because the alternative is little better than homo-sapiens
living in cages surrounded by hostile wastes.</p>

<p>For the short term, using one human grammar based programming language that
allows intercommunication between the majority of homo-sapiens and computers can
greatly increase the supply of programming labor, and thus drive down it’s cost,
which makes the long-term objective cheaper to accomplish.</p>

<blockquote>Has the solution been explained clearly and succinctly?  Can you
describe the solution in simple words? </blockquote>
<p>The long-term solution is providing portable and-or self-assembling
robot-factories.</p>

<p>The short-term solution is a programming language based on linguistic
universals.</p>

<p>The primary funding method is making a project specific crypto currency for
paying bounties on programs and things that bring us closer to fulfilling the
mission.</p>

<blockquote>Is this solution live and usable?</blockquote>
<p>The short-term programming language is in a rudimentary working state, it’s code
is available on gitlab.</p>

<p>◹THE TEAM</p>
<blockquote>Can the management team implement this solution?</blockquote>
<p>Hopefully.</p>
<blockquote>How does their previous experience relate to the
opportunity?</blockquote>
<p>The reptilian’s robot army turned out to be too aggressive an approach, so
trying a more peaceful one.</p>
<blockquote>Why are they qualified to implement this particular solution and
deliver it to market?</blockquote>
<p>The short term solution has been mostly implemented, there are some finishing
touches to bring it to beta.</p>

<blockquote>What is missing from their team?</blockquote>
<p>Feel free to apply to become a team member.  We particularly need people in
China that speak and write in Standard Mandarin to help access and understand
how to market ourselves there, and for making the Pyash-Mandarin interface.</p>

<blockquote>How “hungry” is the management team?</blockquote>
<p>Well-fed.</p>

<p>◹THE MARKET</p>

<blockquote>Is the market large enough to support substantial
growth?</blockquote>
<p>The best margins are in pioneering new markets, which is what both the short and
long-term missions do.</p>

<blockquote>How large is the overall market?</blockquote>
<p>For the short-term, software development is the main source of revenue.<br />
China’s software-development <a href="https://www.ibisworld.com/industry-trends/international/china-market-research-reports/information-transmission-computer-services-software/software-development.html">market</a>
alone is over 700 billion dollars, growing  at over 15% annually.</p>

<p>So globally we are likely looking at trillions of dollars – for the short term
mission’s overall market.</p>

<p>For the long-term in terms of robots, the current market is only approaching a
billion dollars, but the required processing power to implement
human-incarnation worthy robots will likely only be available in the 2030’s, so
there is plenty of time for growth.</p>

<blockquote>How large is the market segment being targeted? Who will be the
customers?</blockquote>
<p>The short term customers will be primarily business owners and IT departments
looking to outsource computer programming and software development.</p>

<p>The long term target segment is a rather broad range, but the initial focus will
likely be earth ecoregions that are not habitable by humans, such as hot deserts
which are likely to increase due to climate change, and underwater.</p>

<p>In terms of a portable robot factory, having submarines is one of the most
viable solutions, because can transport large amounts of equipment, and there is
decreasing amount of wave action with increasing depth.</p>

<blockquote>How will they get people to use their product? Why will people use
this product?</blockquote>
<p>For initial developers a motivating factor may be learning a programming
language without needing a strong grasp of English.  Or for the desire to
socialize with people that speak a different language with higher precision than
offered by Google Translate.</p>

<p>The automatic programmer is also a possible attractant, (though it is not yet
implemented), it could be desirable  especially for business customers as it
would be easier to maintain code, debug code and adapt it to new interfaces.</p>

<p>For the long-term, some people will use robot host-bodies simply because of
availability. 
The portable robot factories should be a hot item, since they are
self-maintaining and produce lots of technological goods from raw materials.</p>

<blockquote>What do people use now?</blockquote>
<p>Native languages which are not computer compatible, and-or Python, and a variety
of other English/Math hybrid languages, which can’t be used for communicating
with humans.</p>

<p>DNA based bodies.</p>
<blockquote>Why will people switch from their current product?</blockquote>
<p>Learning one language for both communicating with humans and computers is easier
to learn and maintain than many.</p>

<p>Electronic bodies offer more control over body composition, cognitive power and
opens new forms of real-estate for habitation.</p>

<p>◹THE COMPETITION</p>
<blockquote>Who is the competition?</blockquote>
<p>For the long-term, most portable factories use containers and trucks, so are
limited in their size and scope to one or a few aspects of what would be
required to make a robot from raw materials.  So for instance a carpenter may
have a workshop in their trailer,  or someone may have a 3D printer.  Currently
the closest to competition would be prefab housing manufacturers, or ship
builders.  Though there are also human mothers.</p>

<p>For the short-term,  the primary competition would be other software development
marketplaces like guru.com, upwork and freelancer.com.</p>

<blockquote>How is their solution/product differentiated from the
market?</blockquote>

<p>For Pyash, the solution is different because it allows for people to hire humans
and-or computers which speak a different language than them.</p>

<p>Most freelancing websites require the service providers to speak English, and to
be human. However for the LiberIT marketplace, people can speak in any language
so long as it compiles to Pyash, and computers can generate code based on
customer specifications.</p>

<p>Also the customers would have to trade in their fiat for cryptocurrency to buy
services, and the service providers would be paid in the cryptocurrency.</p>

<p>For the factories, electronic bodies could be produced to a much greater degree
of specificity, and to alternative eco-regions of the producer, than can human
mothers, who can only create homo-sapiens that are partial clones.</p>

<blockquote>What technologies may compete with theirs in the
future?</blockquote>
<p>For the factories, Gray aliens could be competitors in the future, since they
also can produce host-bodies with greater specificity and for a greater range of
eco-regions than homo-sapiens due to their increased ability with genetic
engineering.  However electronic bodies can live in eco-regions where DNA based
organisms simply can’t survive, such as where liquid water is not viable.</p>

<blockquote>What is their unique value proposition? </blockquote>
<p>The value proposition is that of a LiberIT cryptocurrency which should gain
value once it can be used for buying software development, via the LiberIT
marketplace.</p>

<blockquote>Are there any barriers to entry that will make it difficult for
competitors to enter this market?</blockquote>
<p>Coming up with a programming language based on linguistic universals that isn’t
intrinsically compatible with Pyash is of a level of difficulty that I can’t
calculate.</p>

<blockquote>What will new entrants to this space do?</blockquote>
<p>In order to compete with the Pyash marketplace, the new entrants would have to
have a different marketplace for Pyash or a different language based on
linguistic universals.</p>

<blockquote>How will this team respond?</blockquote>
<p>If there is another language based on linguistic universals that has useful
libraries not available in Pyash,  then it should be a fairly simple process of
translating that language to Pyash, so the libraries get absorbed into the Pyash
code base.</p>

<p>If there is an alternative marketplace for Pyash that is experiencing success.
Analyzing what it is that makes it attractive could be done, and the LiberIT
marketplace improved – by the dedicated humans and computers that receive the
LiberIT cryptocurrency as payment.</p>

<blockquote>
◹THE BUSINESS

What is the business plan?</blockquote>

<p>In short,  an international software supermarket that trades in Pyash coin.</p>

<p>Long term, submarine robot factories, for underwater mining operations.</p>

<blockquote>
 Why hasn’t this opportunity been taken already?
</blockquote>
<p>It’s too grandiose for most people to think of.</p>

<blockquote>
 How much money do they plan to raise?
</blockquote>
<p>For the short term…
It’s pretty much funded.
Will make sense to get more funds when more complete picture takes shape.</p>

<p>Though may need staff and other team members, so they might need money for
salaries and such.  Hopefully could get them internationally, so as to lower
cost. North Americans tend to be expensive.</p>

<p>For the long term…
It could be many millions of dollars, possibly billions,
have to buy a property to make and test submarines,
have to build a robot and boat factory in one.
Gotta build lots of robots and submarines.</p>

<p>Of course with the incremental approach it could be much cheaper, 
maybe could get away with thousands for a small prototype,
such as an underwater mapping submarine.</p>

<blockquote>
 When do they need this money?
</blockquote>
<p>When… I guess when there is a team that needs money.</p>

<p>For the submarines, that may take a while, the deep sea mining industry is still
in its infancy.</p>

<blockquote>
 Why do they need this money, and how exactly will this money be spent? 
</blockquote>
<p>For short term, mostly to pay staff, to do things like legal work, accounting,
public relations, software engineering, customer and technical support.</p>

<p>It could bootstrap in theory… But would be faster with incentive.</p>

<blockquote>
How quickly can this be implemented?
</blockquote>
<p>The international software marketplace, maybe 3 or 4 years, 
the submarine robot factories, decades.</p>

<blockquote>
◹THE RETURN

Investor’s want to see a return on their money, has this been addressed by the
management team?
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, the currency’s value is based on the hard work of humans and computers.
The primary international software marketplace interface will include a
recommended costs benefit calculator, so that a worker could see at what price
they should sell their Pyash coin in order to make a profit.</p>

<p>This should increase incentive for the worker to only sell for that price or
greater, and otherwise to hold. Thus keeping the value of the PyashCoin good for
the majority of people using it to make a living.</p>

<blockquote>
 Are there appropriate incentives to potential investors?
</blockquote>
<p>Early birds will get the standard incentives of any ICO.</p>

<blockquote>
◹TRANSPARENCY
How transparent is the management team?
</blockquote>
<p>Not super great, but all the work is open source and available on the internet
for free.</p>

<blockquote>
 Has anyone ever seen their product? 
</blockquote>
<p>It is still in progress.</p>
<blockquote>
Do you know how their product will work or is it vaporware? 
</blockquote>
<p>Because the plan is so astronomically grandiose. 
The plan is to have a minimally working version before starting the ICO.</p>

<blockquote>
Do they have a github where people can go and check their code, smart contracts,
etc?
</blockquote>
<p>Gitlab, but yeah.
https://gitlab.com/liberit</p>

<blockquote>
 Does the team have a Slack channel where you can go and talk to members of the
team?
</blockquote>
<p>Slack is not open source, so is completely unacceptable.
Could setup a zeronet forum or riot.io if there was any interest,
there is an IRC channel #pyac on freenode.</p>

<blockquote>
 How responsive is the team?
</blockquote>
<p>When a query is noticed, it is responded to in a timely fashion.</p>

<blockquote>
◹LIKELIHOOD OF CRITICAL MASS

This is referring to Metcalfe’s law. Metcalfe’s law states that there is a
critical crossover point where the value of a network grows more than it costs
to acquire the next new user. This is also sometimes called the network effect.
In other words, as more people use this product, the more useful this product
becomes (phones, the internet, Facebook, etc). In competition, Metcalfe’s law is
useful because once a product has critical mass, it creates a barrier for new
entrants which makes it really hard to compete with the product. Does this
product have the potential of achieving critical mass?
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, it most certainly does, due to a number of factors. 
One of the foremost being that it is meant for a truly interlingual audience.</p>

<p>Another  being that there are a huge number of technologies, that all have to
work together in a synchronized dance to make this happen. 
The sheer scale of it means it would be very difficult to make a competing
product which isn’t just a copy.</p>

<p>Also if the competing project is similar, then any of it’s good code could
simply be harvested and assimilated by automated programmers, that would check
for security flaws, trojans and other malware before committing to any beta
testers.</p>
