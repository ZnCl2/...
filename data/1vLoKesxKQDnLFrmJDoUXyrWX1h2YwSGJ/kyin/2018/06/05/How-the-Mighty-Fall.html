<p>I’ve been reading a book about “<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6431063-how-the-mighty-fall?from_search=true">How the Mighty
Fall</a>” by Jim Collins, and I have
to admit it is very fascinating.</p>

<p>Here are some excerpts covering the various stages:</p>

<h2 id="stage-1-hubris">Stage 1: Hubris</h2>

<h3 id="markers-for-stage-1">Markers for Stage 1:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>SUCCESS ENTITLEMENT, ARROGANCE : Success is viewed as
“deserved,” rather than fortuitous, fleeting, or even hard earned
in the face of daunting odds; people begin to believe that suc-
cess will continue almost no matter what the organization
decides to do, or not to do.</li>
  <li>NEGLECT OF A PRIMARY FLYWHEEL: Distracted by extraneous
threats, adventures, and opportunities, leaders neglect a
primary flywheel, failing to renew it with the same creative
intensity that made it great in the first place.</li>
  <li>“WHAT” REPLACES “WHY”: The rhetoric of success (“We’re
successful because we do these specific things”) replaces un-
derstanding and insight (“We’re successful because we under-
stand whywe do these specific things and under what conditions
they would no longer work”).</li>
  <li>DECLINE IN LEARNING ORIENTATION: Leaders lose the inquisi-
tiveness and learning orientation that mark those truly great
individuals who, no matter how successful they become, main-
tain a learning curve as steep as when they first began their
careers.</li>
</ul>

<p>by contrast</p>

<p>”. Finally, the Brazilians
realized, Walton-the founder of what may well become the
world’s first trillion-dollar-per-year corporation-sought first
and foremost to learn from them, not the other way around.
Wal-Mart’s success worried Walton. He fretted over how to
instill his sense of purpose and humble inquisitiveness into the
company beyond his own lifetime, as Wal-Mart grew to hun-
dreds of billions of dollars of annual revenue. Part of his answer
for how to stave off hubris came in handing the company to an
equally inquisitive, self-deprecating CEO, the quiet and low-
profile David Glass. Most people outside retailing do not recog-
nize the name David Glass, which is exactly how Glass would
want it. He learned from Walton that Wal-Mart does not exist
for the aggrandizement of its leaders; it exists for its customers.
Glass fervently believed in Wal-Mart’s core purpose (to enable
people of average means to buy more of the same things previ-
ously available only to wealthier people) and in the need to stay
true to that purpose. And like Walton, he relentlessly sought42

better ways for Wal-Mart to pursue its purpose. He kept hiring
great people, building the culture, and expanding into new
arenas (from groceries to electronics) while adhering to the
principles that made Wal-Mart great in the first place.”</p>

<h2 id="stage-2-over-reaching">Stage 2: Over-reaching</h2>

<p>“To be clear, the problems of Stage 2 stem not from growth per
se, but from the undisciplined pursuit of more. While the Merck
story highlights the perils of growth obsession, we can see Stage
2 behavior in any number of other forms. Discontinuous leaps
into arenas for which you have no burning passion is undisci-
plined. Taking action inconsistent with your core values is un-
disciplined. Investing heavily in new arenas where you cannot
attain distinctive capability, better than your competitors, is un-
disciplined. Launching headlong into activities that do not fit
with your economic or resource engine is undisciplined. Addic-
tion to scale is undisciplined. To neglect your core business
while you leap after exciting new adventures is undisciplined.
To use the organization primarily as a vehicle to increase your
own personal success-more wealth, more fame, more power-
at the expense of its long-term success is undisciplined. To com-
promise your values or lose sight of your core purpose in pursuit
of growth and expansion is undisciplined.
One of the most damaging manifestations of Stage 2 comes
in breaking “Packard’s Law.” (We named this law after David
Packard, cofounder of HP, inspired by his insight that a great
company is more likely to die of indigestion from too much op-
portunity than starvation from too little. 71 Ironically, as we’ll
see when we get to Stage 4, HP itselflater broke Packard’s Law.)”</p>

<h3 id="markers-for-stage-2">MARKERS FOR STAGE 2</h3>

<ul>
  <li>UNSUSTAINABLE QUEST FOR GROWTH, CONFUSING BIG WITH
GREAT: Success creates pressure for more growth, setting up a
vicious cycle of expectations; this strains people, the culture,
and systems to the breaking point; unable to deliver consistent
tactical excel lence, the institution frays at the edges.</li>
  <li>UNOISCIPLINED DISCONTINUOUS LEAPS : The enterprise makes
dramatic moves that fail at least one of the following three tests:
    <ol>
      <li>Do they ignite passion and fit with the company’s core values?</li>
      <li>Can the organization be the best in the world at these activi-
ties or in these arenas?</li>
      <li>Will these activities help drive the organization’s economic or resource engine?</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>DECLINING PROPORTION OF RIGHT PEOPLE IN KEY SEATS: There
is a declining proportion of right people in key seats, because of
losing the right people and/or growing beyond the organization’s
abi lity to get enough people to execute on that growth with
excellence (e.g., breaking Packard’s Law).</li>
  <li>EASY CASH ERODES COST DISCIPLINE: The organization re-
sponds to increasing costs by increasing prices and revenues
rather than increasing discipline.</li>
  <li>BUREAUCRACY SUBVERTS DISCIPLINE: A system of bureau-
cratic rules subverts the ethic of freedom and responsibility that
marks a culture of discipline; people increasingly think in terms
of “jobs” rather than responsibilities.</li>
  <li>PROBLEMATIC SUCCESSION OF POWER: The organization expe-
riences leadership-transition difficulties, be they in the form of
poor succession planning, failure to groom excellent leaders
from within, political turmoil, bad luck, or an unwise selection of
successors.</li>
  <li>PERSONAL INTERESTS PLACED ABOVE ORGANIZATIONAL INTER-
ESTS: People in power allocate more for themselves or their
constituents-more money, more privileges, more fame, more
of the spoils of success-seeking to capitalize as much as
possible in the short term, rather than investing primarily in
building for greatness decades into the future.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="stage-3--denial">Stage 3:  Denial</h2>

<h3 id="markers-for-stage-3">MARKERS FOR STAGE 3</h3>
<ul>
  <li>AMPLIFY THE POSITIVE, DISCOUNT THE NEGATIVE: There is a
tendency to discount or explain away negative data rather than
presume that something is wrong with the company; leaders
highlight and amplify external praise and publicity.</li>
  <li>BIG BETS AND BOLO GOALS WITHOUT EMPIRICAL VALIDATION :
Leaders set audacious goals and/or make big bets that aren’t
based on accumulated experience, or worse, that fly in the face
of the facts.</li>
  <li>INCURRING HUGE DOWNSIDE RISK BASED ON AMBIGUOUS DATA:
When faced with ambiguous data and decisions that have a po-
tentially severe or catastrophic downside, leaders take a positive
view of the data and run the risk of blowing a hole “below the
waterline .”</li>
  <li>EROSION OF HEALTHY TEAM DYNAMICS: There is a marked
decline in the quality and amount of dialogue and debate; there
is a shift toward either consensus or dictatorial management
rather than a process of argument and disagreement followed
by unified commitment to execute decisions.</li>
  <li>EXTERNALIZING BLAME: Rather than accept full responsibility
for setbacks and failures, leaders point to external factors or
other people to affix blame.</li>
  <li>OBSESSIVE REORGANIZATIONS: Rather than confront the
brutal realities, the enterprise chronically reorganizes; people
are increasingly preoccupied with internal politics rather than
external conditions.</li>
  <li>IMPERIOUS DETACHMENT: Those in power become more im-
perious and detached; symbols and perks of executive-class
status amplify detachment; plush new office buildings may
disconnect executives from daily life.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="stage-4-grasping-at-straws">Stage 4: Grasping at straws</h2>

<p>Stage 4 grasping can produce a brief improvement, but the re-
sults do not last. Dashed hope follows dashed hope follows
dashed hope yet again. Companies stuck in Stage 4 try all sorts
of new programs, new fads, new strategies, new visions, new
cultures, new values, new breakthroughs, new acquisitions, and
new saviors. And when one silver bullet fails, they search for
another and then yet another. The signature of mediocrity is not
an unwillingness to change. The signature of mediocrity is
chronic inconsistency.</p>

<p>When we find ourselves in trouble, when we find ourselves on
the cusp of falling, our survival instinct-and our fear-can
evoke lurching, reactive behavior absolutely contrary to survival.
The very moment when we need to take calm, deliberate action,
we run the risk of doing the exact opposite and bringing about
the very outcomes we most fear.</p>

<h3 id="markers-for-stage-4">MARKERS FOR STAGE 4</h3>

<ul>
  <li>A SERIES OF SILVER BULLETS: There is a tendency to make
dramatic, big moves, such as a “game changing” acquisition or
a discontinuous leap into a new strategy or an exciting innova-
tion, in an attempt to quickly catalyze a breakthrough-and
then to do it again and again, lurching about from program to
program, goal to goal, strategy to strategy, in a pattern of chronic
inconsistency.</li>
  <li>GRASPING FOR A LEAOER·AS·SAVIOR: The board responds to
threats and setbacks by searching for a charismatic leader and/
or outside savior.</li>
  <li>PANIC ANO HASTE: Instead of being calm, deliberate, and dis-
ciplined, people exhibit hasty, reactive behavior, bordering on
panic.</li>
  <li>RADICAL CHANGE ANO “REVOLUTION” WITH FANFARE: The lan-
guage of “revolution” and “radical” change characterizes the
new era: New programs’ New cultures! New strategies! Leaders
engage in hoopla, spending a lot of energy trying to align and
“motivate” people, engaging in buzzwords and taglines.</li>
  <li>HYPE PRECEOES RESULTS: Instead of setting expectations
low-underscoring the duration and difficulty of the turn-
around-leaders hype their visions; they “sell the future” to
compensate for the lack of current results, initiating a pattern of
overpromising and underdelivering.</li>
  <li>
    <p>INITIAL UPSWING FOLLOWEO BY OISAPPOINTMENTS: There is an
initial burst of positive results, but they do not last; dashed hope
follows dashed hope; the organization achieves no buildup, no
cumulative momentum.</p>
  </li>
  <li>CONFUSION ANO CYNICISM: People cannot easily articulate
what the organization stands for; core values have eroded to the
point of irrelevance; the organization has become “just another
place to work,” a place to get a paycheck; people lose faith in
their ability to triumph and prevail. Instead of passionately be-
lieving in the organization’s core values and purpose, people
become distrustful, regarding visions and values as little more
than PR and rhetoric.</li>
  <li>CHRONIC RESTRUCTURING ANO EROSION OF FINANCIAL STRENGTH: 
Each failed initiative drains resources ; cash flow and
financial liquidity begin to decline; the organization undergoes
multiple restructurings; options narrow and strategic decisions
are increasingly dictated by circumstance.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="stage-5-capitulation-and-death">Stage 5: Capitulation and Death</h2>

<p>No company we studied was destined to fall all the way to Stage
5, and each company could have made different decisions ear-
lier in the journey to reverse its downward slide. But by the time
a company has moved through Stages 1, 2, 3, and 4, those in
power can become exhausted and dispirited, and eventually
abandon hope. And when you abandon hope, you should begin
preparing for the end.</p>

<p>If we discovered that organizational decline is a function first and
foremost of forces out of our control-and if we discovered that
those who fall will inevitably keep falling to their doom-we could
rightly indulge in despair. But that is not our conclusion from this
analysis, not if you catch decline in Stages I, 2, or 3. And in
some cases, you might even be able to reverse course once in
Stage 4, as long as you still have enough resources to get out of
the cycle of grasping and rebuild one step at a time.</p>

<p>The signature of the truly great versus the merely successful is
not the absence of difficulty, but the ability to come back from
setbacks, even cataclysmic catastrophes, stronger than before.
Great nations can decline and recover. Great companies can fall
and recover. Great social institutions can fall and recover. And
great individuals can fall and recover. As long as you never get
entirely knocked out of the game, there remains always hope.</p>

<p>Never give in. Be willing to change tactics, but never give up
your core purpose. Be willing to kill failed business ideas, even
to shutter big operations you’ve been in for a long time, but
never give up on the idea of building a great company. Be will-
ing to evolve into an entirely different portfolio of activities,
even to the point of zero overlap with what you do today, but
never give up on the principles that define your culture. Be will-
ing to embrace the inevitability of creative destruction, but
never give up on the discipline to create your own future. Be
willing to embrace loss, to endure pain, to temporarily lose free-
doms, but never give up faith in the ability to prevail. Be willing
to form alliances with former adversaries, to accept necessary
compromise, but never-ever-give up on your core values.</p>

<p>The path out of darkness begins with those exasperatingly
persistent individuals who are constitutionally incapable of ca-
pitulation. It’s one thing to suffer a staggering defeat-as will
likely happen to every enduring business and social enterprise
at some point in its history-and entirely another to give up on
the values and aspirations that make the protracted struggle
worthwhile. Failure is not so much a physical state as a state of
mind; success is falling down, and getting up one more time,
without end.</p>
