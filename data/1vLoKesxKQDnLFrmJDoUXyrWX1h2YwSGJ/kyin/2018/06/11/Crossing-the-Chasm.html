<p>So I read some more of the “Beyond the  Chasm” marketing book.</p>

<p>They talk about how ther are enthusiasts/innovators, which like trying out new
tech, and they will pretty much try anything so long as it is free and they can
help make it better. but they generally don’t have much money to throw at these
things.</p>

<p>One of the main interesting points from a financial standpoint is that some
innovators/enthusiasts may have access to “visionaries” or approximately VP/VC
level people that want to use the technology to get ahead of the competition in
some manner.  Typically they will have access to millions of dollars, and may
have some vision for how they can utilize the technology for their particular
purpose, so it’s kindof a double-edged sword, on the one hand it’s a good source
of funding, on the other hand they will likely want/need some control over how
the product is made to make it applicable for their use-case.</p>

<p>These visionaries are pretty few and far in between and generaly they want
something new, so only have at most a few chances once one of these visionaries
picks up on it. Since after a while “the next big thing” will show up and
they’ll be off doing that. 
So the idea is that have to utilize the resouorces given in this initial burst
to launch to the early-majority, or the “pragmatists”.  they stick with things
longer term, but  they need references in order to feel safe with using
something. 
However they dont’ count visonaries as references, but only other pragmatists as
references. 
The key here is have to find a small B2B niche that is “hurting real bad” for a
solution that our tech can alleviate/solve.</p>

<p>once have the product developed for that small B2B niche, can have some good
references, and can get a toehold into the early-majority. 
at which point have to spread to other niches, until have enough of a
strong-hold to have wide appeal.</p>

<p>I think an ICO may be equivalent to a “visionary” early-adopter kinda fund.</p>

<p>The most natural “pragmatist niche” for Pyash is providing software for managing
formal multi-lingual  meetings,  basically replacing the roles of
president/secretary/translator.  particularly useful for multi-national holding
companies,  government bodies that have multiple official languages, and
corporations operating within a linguistically diverse area.</p>

<p>though I think something like that would have to be after the software
supermarket is setup,
as the software supermarket is basically and outsourcing solution that makes it
cheaper/easier to develop other software.</p>
