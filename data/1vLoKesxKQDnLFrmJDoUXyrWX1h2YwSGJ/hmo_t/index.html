<p>An alternative corporate structure made possible because of Pyash deliberative
democracy.</p>

<h2 id="profit-strategy">Profit Strategy</h2>

<p>People would have ideal scenario for achieving self-actualization,
many self-actualization ideas may be profitable.  The originator would get a
percentage of the profit and have the companies sizeable resources to help make
it a reality.</p>

<h3 id="different-culture">Different Culture</h3>

<p>One of the first mover disadvantages is training staff, that is then hired up by
competitors. By having a different culture, it may be possible to make it
relatively difficult for a competitor to meet the needs of employees, which are
used to working ~2 hours a day, having a steady paycheck, and plenty of family
time,  social and spirtual group events, possibly intentional communities, that 
make even a small income from us, worth more than one nth times greater from a 
SAC (Standard American Corporation) culture.</p>

<p>For instance, technically most humans only need a fairly small income to meet
their basic needs, of food, water and shelter. An intentional community can
provide safety, security and belongingness. Prestige can be gained by doing well
in work, or helping people in the community.  Self-actualization can be achieved
through creative pioneering in any of the many areas that are necessary for 
successful robot civilization
seeds.</p>

<p>People will be able to start and maintain families in the communities (with
between 1 and ~200 people), as that is part of the cosmist research. 
So all the family members and children can be paid for the services 
and data they provide to the company.</p>

<p>There is also the alternative that people could have this steady salary, and
not be in a community. Perhaps they want to live a nomadic existence, that is
fully acceptable as well. Only have to work 9 months of the year, between 1 and
 4 hours per weekday.  Very few companies would be willing to allow for such
a thing.</p>

<p>We can ascertain whay the employee/contractor wants in their ideal life during
the interview process. And of course they can change their mind later on and try
out different lifestyles which may be available.</p>

<p>The goal is not so much to hire a few people and pay them huge quantities, 
but rather to hire a large number of people, and help them have a good quality
life.</p>
