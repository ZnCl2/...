I experienced something like this just a couple years ago during my studies, Legion : ] When my relations with the \"outside world\" were nearly zero. I used to stay closed at home or somewhere alone in the hills (I live in a place far away from the city) and the only people I was talking with were from the \"englishness internet\", sometime Italian friends and of course, family.. But the main language in which I was studying was English.. so happened that, talking with family, I tried to say a thing in Italian that simply I didn't remember! So I said \"I'm missing the Italian word for ....... anyway, I'm talking about that thing made this way [...]' It has been a funny situation xD\n\nIt happened more than once and currently happens!.. So your words are familiar to me : )\n\nMy English can be not so much good (I should go abroad like You did to master It) but the daily use of It, affected my main language anyway ^^\n\nThanks for your experience sharing Legion!! ^_^",

For this reason I don't want to target to art job, sad.But not blaming the job itself, I'm blaming the unhonest of the company when they try every possibility to sell their product.\n\nYes, I use Blender too.. It is a **great** piece of software.. I'm promoting It everywhere ^_^\n\nUsing animations to promote my business doesn't mean I will enslave the artistic work (even if many do It) but that I will enhance the time customers are spending in my local.. What I am thinking at is an holographic (projected) pyramid where models take form and animate ^_^\n\nI see it less commercial, more emotional and so.. ethical ^_^",

Maybe try to submit a feature request to the maintainers of your Linux distribution?\n\nactually, the mayor problem was to type more than visualizing ^^\nby the way, my daily Linux distribution is Arch, so almost e.thing is not included by default :)\nregarding Xubuntu.. the default IM is not fcitx so it makes sense that it is not included just, by default is not possible to write in japanese (don't know about other writing systems) so an important feature could be a sort of \"merge\" with fcitx for what concerns other writing symbols u.u",
