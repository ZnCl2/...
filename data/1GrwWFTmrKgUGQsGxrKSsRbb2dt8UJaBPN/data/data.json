This was unexpected!\nI then tried to push some like/comment to my blog and contents failed to publish to peers... this got me suspicious and started investigation.. since I noticed something strange into my `data/users/content.json` and in particular the `\"signs\"` section was reporting the address of the zite generate by my clone action on the ZeroBlog.. so I tried a couple things untill I found out [HERE](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1BLogC9LN4oPDcruNz3qo1ysa133E9AGg8/?Post:3:How+to+have+a+blog+like+this) that the `data/users` folder was meant to be signed just like the zite address! so I basically deleted all the content in it _[just my account folder, actually]_ and copied `data-default/users/content-default.json` into `data/users/content.json`\nI then signed\n\n```\n# /path/to/zeronet/zeronet.py siteSign [ziteaddress] --inner_path data/users/content.json\n```\n\nso started zeronet and broadcasted the changes to the peers.\n\n@ssdifnskdjfnsdjk confirmed the problem was solved and I smiled :)\n\nHope my experience will be valuable to you too and if you feel to, [share a drink with me](/1DRAW7p2SVKwKVAQ7GYqFs2uYxmM4AJUxW/?Post:2:donation) ;)\n\n_c'yaaa!!!\nFraYoshi :)_"

I've tried to double check permissions, substituted keys with the previous ones from the backups, took searches, updated ZeroNet... until I remember that my ZeroNet data folder was on the periodic scheduler of `snapper`, so I just run the command `btrfs -c (name of the config) undochange (oldsnapshot)..0` and everything came back to normal :)\n\nSo I must thank Open Suse's snapper software for the success of my rescue mission! : )\n\nThis is how I've been able to handle the casualty! ^^ and I suggest you doing snapshots too, sometime unexpected things occur and these are a life saver :3\n\nOh... and in the meantime, I big failed in my attempt to save the blog draft and published as an empty post instead! as @leftside let me notice `XD`\n\n![IPFS blog-drafting-fail.png](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/Qme2HfeQtjfrJwQoarhctYzQ8jiQ8afS3SEGG2YY6fKm66)\n\njust, I can't recall hitting the _Sign & Publish_ button, uhm... part of my odd experience? who knows :)\n\nEver happened something similar to any of you?\n\nHave you wrote a blog about?

This directive, if promulgated, will significantly limit the freedom of the Internet.\n\nInstead of updating the copyright laws in Europe to promote everyone's participation in the information society, it threatens online freedom and creates obstacles to accessing the Net by imposing new barriers, filters, and restrictions. If the proposal is approved, it may be impossible to share a newspaper article on social networks or find it on a search engine. Wikipedia itself could risk closing.\n\nThe proposal has already met with the firm disapproval of over 70 computer scientists, including web creator Tim Berners-Lee, 169 academics, 145 organizations working in the fields of human rights, freedom of the press, scientific research and the computer industry and the Wikimedia Foundation.\n\nFor these reasons, the Italian Wikipedia community has decided to obscure all encyclopedia pages. We want to continue to offer a free, open, collaborative encyclopedia with verifiable content. We therefore ask all Members of the European Parliament to reject the current text of the directive and to reopen the debate by examining the many proposals of the Wikimedia associations, starting with the abolition of Articles 11 and 13, as well as the extension of the freedom of panorama to the whole EU and the protection of the public domain.\n\nThe Italian community of Wikipedia.\n\n[https://it.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Comunicato_3_luglio_2018](https://it.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Comunicato_3_luglio_2018)"

My computer started to become something that could cause me legal troubles! My windows license was not a professional one and the budget was almost zero so I started informing on alternatives and Linux Popped out of my mind :)\n\nMy computer science knowledge was very minimum at the time... so I opted for testing the thing on an old netbook of which hard drive was broken so I flashed a [**Linux Mint**](https://linuxmint.com) ISO and started playing with the thing. Mint was a good start.. Lightweight and enough similar to win =)\n\nI played with It for like a month and in the meantime, I searched for the right distro to install on my desktop computer. I ended up with [**Ubuntu Studio**](https://ubuntustudio.org)! It aimed to be the distro for the artists so It was the distro for me!\n\nThanks to this amazing distro I've been able to rebuild my workflow from scratch! Indeed It comes with almost every software You can need to bring your projects to life! ^^\n_[on the bottom of the blog, You can find my software choices]_\n\nDuring the 2 years in which I used Ubuntu Studio these things have happened:\n\n*   I totally deleted Windows from the dual boot and fresh installed Linux\n*   I started deploying servers to get my renders done\n*   I discovered Arch Linux and started wondering to be able to install It ^^\n\nFinally, after the 2 years, I've been able to do that and get Arch Installed!\n\n![ipfs of my actual Arch Linux Desktop with xfce4 as DE and a local japanese session opened](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmdsbjnZhwzDYRHxrnqBwWRqYvbAe5YXpE2PzssddevQnd)\n\nAnd with great power.. comes a great desire to knowledge! haha! :D this is because after the successful setup of the thing.. I started moving at bigger steps into computer science! My desire to knowledge grow up when, from time to time, I was discovering new things that could be done on Linux that was difficult or not possible on Windows =) For what concerned my work or just my hobbies ^^\n\n## **SO WHY LINUX?**\n\n### **_(or better: GNU/LINUX)_**\n\nBecause the possibilities offered by this OS are limitless ^^\nBecause I've been able to get the thing done when I thought It was impossible with my hardware\nBecause It interested me more and more to computer science\nBecause It gave me, someway, work :)\n\n### **DO YOU THINK LINUX IS BETTER THAN WINDOWS?**\n\nNo.. Every OS has It's advantage... Windows is good for gaming! : ]\n\n<u>****__****</u>\n\n## **SOFTWARE I USE FOR MY WORK**\n\n### **The suite of software I studied and worked with before discovering Linux:**\n\n*   **Film-Making/Photo**: whole Adobe Suite + Cinema 4D (basic stuff)\n\n*   **CAD**: Autodesk AutoCAD\n\n*   **Streaming**: OBS\n\n### **The suite of software I am now working with:**\n\n**| Film-Making |**\n|- **VIDEO**\n|-- Blender: NLE\n|-- FFmpeg / HandBrake: codec conversions\n\n|- **AUDIO**\n|-- Ardour\n|-- Audacity\n\n|- **COMPOSITING**\n|-- Blender\n|-- Natron\n\n|- **GRAPHICS**\n|-- Inkscape\n|-- Krita\n|-- Gimp\n\n**| 3D | CAD |**\n|-- Blender\n **| Photo |**\n|-- Darktable\n|-- Krita\n|-- Gimp\n\n**| STREAMING |**\n|-- OBS\n\nAnd in the end... **JACK2** to sync audio and video playback between software :)\n\nAs You can see.. On Linux, I no longer use only a software suite to archive the final result and this because I learned that despite from the only plausible choice on the Windows OS for these kinds of work... Now I have access to a universe of users maintained software that does the thing well and not a suite of easy to sell software :)"

It is so limitative, i mean... The world speaks many languages but only one is spoke by every nation: English.\n\n---\nSo I switched, even if I never been a master in speaking It.. Then It happened. I have been 1 week in a Swedish family and the father of this told me that He never studied the language.. but He was talking It so much better than me. I became curious and asked  \"How is It possible?\" He told me that in Sweden they don't usually have a translation to Swedish for films.. but only for toons! So He learned by watching subtitled films! Back to Italy I started doing the same and my English skill has increased! Cool!!! Now I can understand It so much better but what about talking.. It is so much more difficult.. no way for this, I was in need of exercising!..... For fortune I knew some beautiful people from outside the nation and we started talking :)\n\nMy skills increased just a couple years ago, when I joined some classes to the MIT OpenCourseWare.. The main one was thermodynamics! Listening to the teacher and taking notes helped me so much!!! because I was writing, listening and thinking all the same time! Perfect ^_^\n\nSo I felt ready to make some YouTube videos in the English language! And I started my actual [VemoLink serie](http://127.0.0.1:43110/14sYamG8agjTLeW8DfwTKbYRmTwaPbs4au) and this helped me so much ^_^\n\nBut why the title is asking about both languages?\n\nWell.. Currently I'm discovering again my mother language.. and It doesn't sound that bad... not more and the reason behind is probably because of my better understanding of English.. I can now watch at films without subtitles, vlogs, documentaries... I feel ready to... come back to the Italian ^^\n\nBut my main language now is confused! Online I should talk in English but in Italy people don't really understand other languages.. so It comes out difficult to talk (online) with people of my country!! For sure I could write longer messages with both translations but tweets have limited characters and I can't make double videos in both languages because of time, so... which language?\n\nMy actual solution is to use sometime a language and sometime the other one! Even if It generate a little bit of confusion ^^\"\n\nHave You any suggestion for me, fellow blogger reader/writer? :)\n\n.:FraYoshi\n\n**EDIT**\n\nI asked on my Telegram channel about this and the confusion raised ahhahaha\n\n![sonda_ita_eng](media/img/sonda_ita_eng.png)\n\n-------------------------\n\npic CC0 by [Wikipedia](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Italia-USA-Bandiera.png)"
