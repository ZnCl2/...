						<h1>Welcome to PedoHub!</h1>
						<div>
							PedoHub is a ZeroMe merger hub.
						</div>
						<div>
							Its purpose is to provide a place, where pedophiles can communicate freely,
							without risk of censorship or discrimination against them.
						</div>
						<div class="space"></div>
						<div>
							All types of content are allowed here and will never be removed by me.
						</div>
						<div>
							Note however, that while this does include childporn, it may also include hurtcore, rape, snuff and gore.
						</div>
						<div>
							If you do not wish to see that type of content, please use the native ZeroNet features to blacklist the
							people that post it and/or the content itself.
							<div class="em">
								Do not assume that I approve of everything posted on this hub, just because I don't take action against it.
							</div>
							I have my opinions and so do you.
						</div>
						<div>
							And while I certainly have the ability to do so, I do not have the right to silence yours in favor of mine.
						</div>
						<div class="space"></div>
						<div>
							While this hub is intended to be used by pedophiles, this doesn't mean
							you have to be one, in order to register your account here. If
							you can deal with the risk of being falsely classified as a pedophile and feel
							like you can trust the high security standards, that often(not always) come with
							services made and used by pedophiles, then feel free to join.

						<div class="collapsible">
							<div>No, you are not.</div>
							<div>
								While this hub is likely to contain images that are illegal in many countries, files are only downloaded to your
								computer if they are needed. 
							</div>
							<div>
								This means, that images will get onto your machine, only if you click on them within 
								ZeroMe(or any other zite, that supports the ZeroMe merger hubs).
							</div>
							<div>
								 Just viewing this page is not illegal. Using this hub or just seeding it
								 to read the posts made by users of this hub is also not illegal as long, as you
								 are careful with the images in those posts.
							</div>
							<!-- 
							<div>
								Keep in mind:
							</div>
							<div>
								You only seed the images you posted and those you chose to view(download, by clicking on them) 
								and not delete in the past. 
							</div>
							<!-- 
							<div>
								Nevertheless I would strongly advice to use the Tor network for additional security,
								since many agencies have history of makeing very broad strokes when it comes to
								pedophiles, regardless whether or not you actually are one or just a bystander.

						<input type="checkBox" class="collapsibleStateStore" id="howJoin" checked></input>
						<label for="howJoin" class="collapsibleTitle">How do I join?</label>
						<div class="collapsible">
							<div>
								Joining is fairly easy.
							</div>
							<div>
								First you'll need an ID. See the <div class="bold">specs</div> section below for a list of supported providers.
							</div>
							<div>
								Secondly visit <a href="/1MeFqFfFFGQfa1J3gJyYYUvb5Lksczq7nH/">ZeroMe</a> (or any other zite, that uses the ZeroMe merger hubs) and select your ID, by clicking on <div class="code">Select your account</div>.
								Once you click on the ID you want to use, you should get automatically redirected to the registration page. If, for some reason, you didn't get redirected,
								click on <div class="code">Create profile</div> on the ZeroMe main page, to get there. That page will let you choose on what hub you want to be registered on.
							</div>
							<div>
								To register on this hub, simply click the <div class="code">Join!</div>-
								button on the field for <div class="code">PedoHub</div>, which should be located somewhere in the <div class="code">Seeded HUBs</div> section.
							</div>
							<div>
								And just like that, you are done. 
							</div>
							<div class="space"></div>
							<div>Note:</div>
							<div>
								Take care not to accidentally register twice or on multiple hubs, since that
								can cause diverse issues and is generally not easy to fix.
							</div>
							<div>
								If you do happen to register in two hubs,
								go to <a href="/1QHbf72f4vdx3QAxN1LTN9KP19J428Q85R/">ZeroMe Unfuck</a> and follow
								the instructions there. That usually fixes it.
							</div>
						</div>
					</li>
					<li>
						<input type="checkBox" class="collapsibleStateStore" id="howWork" checked></input>
						<label for="howWork" class="collapsibleTitle">How does ZeroMe work?</label>
						<div class="collapsible">
							<div>
								ZeroMe is a merger zite. That means, that content storage and content display are separated.
							</div>
							<div>
								The zite ZeroMe itself manages, how the content is displayed, while the hubs store the actual content you browse on ZeroMe.
							</div>
							<div class="space"></div>
							<div>
								There are two types of hubs. <div class="code">User registry hubs</div> and <div class="code">User content hubs</div>.
								<ul class="headedList">
									<li>
										<div class="code">User registry hubs</div> 
										<div>
											These hubs are used for the <div class="code">New users</div> and <div class="code">Suggested users</div> sections on ZeroMe.
										</div>
										<div>
											Only one of these does currently exists. It is the <a href="/1UDbADib99KE9d3qZ87NqJF2QLTHmMkoV/">ZeroMe user registry</a>
											and is hard coded into all (current) ZeroMe implementations. 
										</div>
										<div>
											The <div class="code">content.json</div> of that hub only allows the providers ZeroID and ZeroVerse.
										</div>
										<div>
											That has the effect, that if you register with neither of them, your account will not
											show up in those sections.
										</div>
										<div>
											Depending on your situation, this could be desirable or undesirable, since all registered users will show up in both sections will show everyone that
											uses ZeroMe.
										</div>
									</li>
									<li>
										<div class="code">User content hubs</div>
										<div>
											These are where your profile, posts, comments and replies are stored.
										</div>
										<div>
											There are many hubs out there(this hub being one of them).
											A list of most of them can be found on <a href="/1GLndW2MJn7japuF3X2tbfBqgPMR52zaLQ/">Get All Hub</a>.
										</div>
										<div>
											Every post you make will be stored on the hub, that you registered on. If you comment on a post, that is not stored on your hub, than your content is stored twice, once on the hub you're on and once on the hub of the user you wrote a comment to. Since all content is
											stored on hubs, you can only see posts from hubs you already visited(downloaded) once before. 
										</div>
										<div>
											In other words: The more hubs you have, the more posts you're able to see (the posts in the<div class="code">Everyone</div> section of ZeroMe).
										</div>
										<div> 
											Even though ZeroMe does not have an moderation system, hub owners(this can be either hub runners or anyone
											that has the private key of the hub) have absolute power over that hub. If they so chose to, they are able to delete posts, users and the hub itself(by turning the entire hub into an blank page, for example),
											however they cannot meaningfully edit user data and deleting posts/users requires work, that is likely to be noticed, by more tech savvy people
											and everyone, that happened to be also using that hub at that time.
										</div>
									</li>

					<li>
						<input type="checkBox" class="collapsibleStateStore" id="whyImgWhite" checked></input>
						<label for="whyImgWhite" class="collapsibleTitle">Why is the image/avatar I posted on ZeroMe white?</label>
						<div class="collapsible">
							<div>
								Due to its strong canvas fingerprint protection, uploading an avatar(profile image)
								and images in general, is currently not possible in Tor Browser version 8 and above.
							</div>
							<div class="space"></div>
							<div>
								Since this is a bug within ZeroMe, there is nothing I can do(I only own this hub, not ZeroMe itself).
							</div>
							<div>
								If you want to post images or upload a profile image, you'll have to either temporarily use
								firefox(or any another browser) or temporarily disable the canvas fingerprint protection,
								which you can do by going to <div class="code">about:config</div>, searching for <div class="code">privacy.resistFingerprinting</div>
								and setting it to <div class="code">false</div>, while uploading the image.
							</div>
							<div>
								<div class="bold">Do not</div> forget to turn this setting back to <div class="code">true</div> once you're done!
							</div>
							<div class="space"></div>
							<div>
								<div class="underline">Explanation</div>:
							</div>
							<div>
								ZeroMe will redraw each image before actually uploading it,
								by accsessing the canvas element, but any attempt to do that 
								is ignored by the Tor Browser. Since ZeroMe does not receive an error, it just assumes
								that the image has been successfully redrawn and continues to upload the 'redrawn' image, which is still empty.	
							</div>
							<div>
								This is why your uploaded images are just white images.
							</div>
	
							<div class="space"></div>
							<div>
								I will remove this section, once this bug gets resolved.
							</div>
						</div>
					</li>
					<li>
						<input type="checkBox" class="collapsibleStateStore" id="areYouTLA" checked></input>
						<label for="areYouTLA" class="collapsibleTitle">Is this a honeypot?</label>
						<div class="collapsible">
							<div>
								No it is not.
							</div>
							<div>
								This page does not require any JavaScript to be activated. You can check this, by adding <div class="code">/raw/</div> in front of the
								address of this hub, or clicking this <a href="/raw/1PedoHubPRhuSRoVHspoeuTVvzHHxLM7Wf/">link</a>, which will do that for you.
							</div>
							<div>
								The source code of this hub can be found at the git repository over on <a href="/18rZnaZXpAYu86oQaJZYaXHBzZjSW9jCT7">GitCenter</a>,
								where I publish the source code myself.
							</div>
							<div class="space"></div>
							<div> 
								Since we are on ZeroNet you can(unlike on clearnet sites) actually verify, that the code in the repo
								is actually the code running on this hub.
							</div>
							<div>
								By design of Zeronet, there is no server where this hub is hosted, so there is no server,
								that could run, log and do who-knows-what. This means all source code for and any
								file in this hub(and any zite in general) must visible and accessible to everyone at any time. You can simply look at 
								those files to check, whether or not the source on the git repo matches the actually executed code.
							</div>
							<div> 
								This way you are able to know what exactly the hub is doing and don't
								have to blindly take my word for it and know that I didn't just remove the malicious lines of code before I
								posted them to the GitCenter repository.
							</div>
							<div class="space"></div>
							<div> 
								The folder where ZeroNet stores this hub, is located at: 
								<div class="code">[PathToYourZeronetDataDir]/1PedoHubPRhuSRoVHspoeuTVvzHHxLM7Wf/</div>.
								<div>
									The files and folders you'll see there are:
									<ul class="headedList">
										<li><div class="code">/index.html</div><div>This is the html page you are watching right now. It is, traditionally, the first page you see of a website.</div></li>
										<li><div class="code">/content.json</div><div>This file tells ZeroNet which files it needs to download in order for the hub to work as intended. More information about it's structure are in the official <a href="/1DocsYf2tZVVMEMJFHiDsppmFicZCWkVv1/site_development/content_json/">ZeroNet documentation</a>.</div></li>
										<li><div class="code">/data/users/</div><div>All posts, images and profile data of all registered users is stored here, ordered by the public key address of the user. There is also one file in there(which is the <div class="code">content.json</div>, that is explained below).</div></li>

See the <div class="code">user_contents</div> section of the official ZeroNet documentation above or click <a href="/1DocsYf2tZVVMEMJFHiDsppmFicZCWkVv1/site_development/content_json/#user_contents">this</a> link for more info.</div></li>
