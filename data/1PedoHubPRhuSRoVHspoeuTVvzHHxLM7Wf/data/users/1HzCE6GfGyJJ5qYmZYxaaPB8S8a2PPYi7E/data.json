			"body": "I took her to a coffee shop today. She did her homework and I sketched her. And the entire time I was using that as a flimsy excuse to admire her beautiful face and as I was watching the way she chews her lips on particularly difficult questions it dawned on me that it's the little things I love about her. I mean, it's nice to look down from my phone and catch her staring at me with love and adoration. It's how she blushes and smiles a little when I do. Or how she melts into me when she's doing the dishes and I sneak up and hug her from behind. \n\nIt's the way we can paint together and make slime on a whim just because she saw a cool slime video. It's spending hours with her and swearing it's only been a minute. It's the way she snaps me updates about her day and how we fall asleep together on Facetime. It's the way she hits me and calls me adorkable when I make a bad pun. It's every eskimo nuzzle after we greet each other with a kiss and the way she gives me these children's bedroom eyes when she's feeling frisky. It's every butterfly in my stomach as we hold hands and every giggle when we poke fun of dumb TV shows. It's the love in her captivatingly blue eyes when I'm geeking out about something.\n\nLife is worth living, sometimes.",
