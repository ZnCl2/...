Some system requirements are missing. I love Qubes and hope that I find at next a machine where I can install it again. Till then I am very happy with Arch Linux.\n\nX230!!!!

The python3 version adds quite a bit more dependencies to ZeroNet which the python package manager(pip) needs to install(see README on the py3 branch). However (by the looks of it) whonix blocks any connection pip tries to make to the internet, so the packages can't be downloaded and for some there isn't a packaged version available in the OS repo base58(in requirements.txt) for example. One way around this would be to manually download the packages an then install the local download with pip, but that seems somewhat too hacky for me to be practical(updating those will be annoying).\n\nThere is no pip-secure alternatives providing https? \nTemplates don't permit direct communications to internet by default. You could temporarily permit internet access in the template settings if I recall, but that would leave you with unmaintained libraries, which is not desirable.  \n\nI'm pretty sure dependencies will make their way into Whonix repos, with proper instructions, when upstreamed. Came across forum posts saying pip was not secure enough to be used on whonix a while ago but can't find it in my history right now.\n\nFor my part, i'm sticking to py2 until it is upstreamed and taken cared of properly. Not a fan of unmaintained code running into whonix-ws template and template dependent qubes.",

I already made a script that does an automated install on a freshly cloned fedora29 template. (I can send it to you, if you want to try it for yourself) It's something that Whonix does.\n> \n> Honestly, I don't think they'll do. They are like pretty python-pip exclusive. The fact that so many even are in the OS repo is surprising to me considering that you'd not typically expect npm, cargo or maven(or whatever that java things was called) packages to be there either.\n> \n> It isn't really unmaintained code, you'd just need to update it every once in a while.\n> I also just realized the the Whonix wiki recommends installing ZeroNet to the appVM and not to the templateVM. I don't think that this is a good idea, an attacker exploiting a bug in ZeroNet shouldn't be able to permanently compromise your appVM(by adding some lines to a .py file in zeronets installation directory, for example)\n\nCan look into it. send it over ZeroMail :)\nBut that fits with what they say...https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Install_Software\n\nAvoid Third Party Package Managers\n\"There are many third party package managers besides APT, however they lack the security safeguards that are standard in Debian. Popular examples are pip and node.js. The security concern with third party options is they do not verify the code comes from the author. When used, these package managers will run processes that pull untrusted code from the Internet and perform operations with root level permissions. If a trusted Workstation VM is required for sensitive use cases such as a Bitcoin wallet, then users should completely avoid this option. [3] [4] \"",
