			"title": "T-Bone Burnett",
			"body": "Joseph Henry \"T Bone\" Burnett III (born January 14, 1948) is an American record producer, musician, and songwriter. As producer of the soundtrack O Brother, Where Art Thou?, he renewed interest in American roots music. He received a Grammy Award for that album, for the soundtracks Cold Mountain (2004), Walk the Line (2006), Crazy Heart (2010), and for Raising Sand (2007), in which he united the contemporary bluegrass of Alison Krauss with the blues rock of Robert Plant.\n\n[![](https://gateway.ipfs.io/ipfs/QmdBGsJtCojJ7XHhrCnhKcKjBAhyVVZ6c7xJHLzgSH2uvx/fileDJucNx-800x.jpg)](https://gateway.ipfs.io/ipfs/QmPx3DWw6CcTsTPQmaF6YwnVfY1Lu4gtiswKn8atqxf6Ji/fileDJucNx.jpg)\n\nBurnett helped start the careers of BoDeans, Counting Crows, Los Lobos, Sam Phillips, and Gillian Welch, and he revitalized the careers of Gregg Allman and Roy Orbison. He produced music for the television programs Nashville and True Detective. He has released several solo albums, including Tooth of Crime, which he wrote for a revival of the play by Sam Shepard.\n\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_Bone_Burnett\n- http://127.0.0.1:43110/ZeroLSTN.bit/?/artist/T-Bone%20Burnett",

But I listened to several other songs of this artist, even from the same album - a completely different style, different music. Do not like it :) But \"It's Not Too Late\" - it's a masterpiece!\n\n[![](https://gateway.ipfs.io/ipfs/QmeoMd4BfkxBdGmfoLsaJNec887BDp9stYoGSARtCoki5X/file5hZ2aZ-800x.jpg)](https://gateway.ipfs.io/ipfs/QmUBhBq8A5cb4bCPpXv3dLTWDy5yA2YLhmq2fRMqQwyjKm/file5hZ2aZ.jpg)\n\n```\nThe wind turns like a dagger\nThe rain falls like a hammer\nThe sky has grown dark\nBut it's not too late\n\nThe weather crashes down\nWhat's lost cannot be found\nThe night is closing\nBut it's not too late\n\nIt's not too late\nIt's not too late\nIt's not too late\nIt's not too late\nThe atmosphere is lethal\nBut I will fear no evil\n\nThe ocean rolls like thunder\nThe tempest pulls us under\nThe dogs are howling\nBut it's not too late\n\nAs broken structures rust\nFalse idols turn to dust\nAll lies in ashes\nAnd it's not too late\n\nIt's not too late\nIt's not too late\nIt's not too late\nIt's not too late\nThe atmosphere is lethal\nBut I will fear no evil\n\nIn the dark before the dawn\nThe echo of the siren's song\nDies away like a ghost\nAs the day breaks\n\nIt's not too late\nIt's not too late\nIt's not too late\nIt's not too late\nThe atmosphere is lethal\nBut I will fear no evil\n```",
