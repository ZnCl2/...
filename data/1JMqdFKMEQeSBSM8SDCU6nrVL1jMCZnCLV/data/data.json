			"body": "\nWhat is a Logical topology?\n\nA logical topology defines the logical connectivity of network devices on a computer network. So, it might happen that the devices connected in one type of physical topology might have different underlying logical topology.\n\nIf we elaborate more on the physical topology, it is essentially the placement of the various network components in a computer like the placement of the devices, the connection among the devices, installation of the cables etc. On the other hand, logical connection defines how data flows among the devices.\n\nFor example, let say there are five devices (A, B, C, D and E) that are connected in a row. This configuration of network devices might look more like a Bus topology. But let’s say device A can directly transmit the data to the device E. That means it looks more like a Circle which a Ring topology logically but a bus topology physically.\n\nWe will talk about different kinds of topologies — physical and logical — one by one in the next article.
