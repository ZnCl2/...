Unfortunately I have little experience with tor, it's pretty slow in my network, VPS is enough for me.\n\n> Specifically, it seems that to spread the content over both \"0net-clear\" and \"0net-tor\" you need at least one \"bridging\" node that will serve your content to both networks \n\nI guess that is not necessary, I don't use tor  but from the \"0\" config panel and `/path/to/zeronet/data/content.db` I still have a lot connection with tor and onion addresses.",

Using tor can surf http websites, maybe using similar technique it can connect to peer without tor available. \n\n> I wonder if there's a way to force a connection from tor user to open-port user. That might help.\n\nAs mentioned in my article, using ssh works in this way. For tor it may be a different question: If I'm using tor and my port is closed, can I still easily publish zite to other tor peer, just like my port is still opened in the tor network?",

Maybe the new authors just don't care or forget to change the license.. ",

It looks like that it works...\n\nYep, I tried that before, adding more \"!important\" to every line may help, but iirc the profile affects all websites and slows down browser performance, also my code includes regexp but Firefox profile doesn't support it, so part of the code doesn't work",

The second idea should really be implemented, [..] so we have to make a browser extension, and now we have to support lots of browsers...\n\nMainly Firefox and Chromium I guess, here it's one for ssb: https://github.com/soapdog/patchfox Secure Scuttlebutt packaged as a Web Extension for Firefox.
