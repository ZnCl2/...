I've created my own base64 image, using a perfect single pentagon tiling pattern and transparent background, and it has optical illusion effect as the background color is mono but left panel and right panel look like in different color! How is it for you? :D\n\n> That might be the reason why it makes me frown on it. There is a common principle that it might be unnerving when two things are extremely similar, but still different. No idea how it's called in design, but in visual art it is sometimes referred to as \"uncanny valley\". It's also the reason why very close tones can be unpleasant. And there's a similar principle in evolution, i think, even though there's no perceiving agent.\n\n\"uncanny valley\" is a pretty interesting effect, but I guess it's more about humanoid vs human, AI vs human intelligence, and can't fit the situation you're viewing my previous UI design. Tone as comparison (analogy) doesn't fit this situation, too, imo. As sound and image are totally two different things.\n\nBut I agree that it doens't look very comfortable, especially when looking at it carefully, but from a longer distance it looks fine ;)\n\n> Irregular pattern is ok as long as it's not too prominent. When i perceive it as 2D pattern, it's ok. Maybe just a bit too noticeable on fast scrolling. But when i perceive a line of it as an isolated 1D pattern, it is somewhat (degree depends on which pattern line happens to be neighbouring) unpleasant. If textual description is not good enough, i can make simplistic illustration tomorrow.\n\nFor me fast scrolling is ok, because it's square and the color between different pixel is very similar. I think the effect should be similar to rotating fan, the color will mix together and looks the same, but it may differ between individuals.",

Also it may be related to [Afterimage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afterimage). Anyway, it's bad for eyes to watch the LED screen for too long time ;) therefore I created dark theme, and prefer using Eink products.\n\n> Then, if my brain considers it feasible that the distortions are due to the pattern scrolling, it blames that, and if it can't (either because there's no content or no pattern to scroll), it has to accept the failing of the display/view angle/etc.\n\nXD, yep, what we see is also quite subjective.",

I just mean that you should change your BinChan's Dark Theme for this blog or disable it completely. For example, I usually browse with dark theme enabled, so I didn't notice changes on your site before I switched Stylish off.\n\nThanks for the suggestion. For me that's ok, since not everyone on ZeroNet will use my userstyle theme, not all browser supports Stylus or Stylish addon either.\n\nBtw, I have a weird idea about creating a feature of showing different color theme in different time of a day, like changing  the color theme slightly every hour.. Outside the window there is sunrise and sunset, the color of the street keeps changing, why not try to simulate it in our digital world :3",

I use it for helping seeding sites, big files, etc. And my home network has not static ip, because too many users here and ISP uses [NAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation) technique to save IPs.
