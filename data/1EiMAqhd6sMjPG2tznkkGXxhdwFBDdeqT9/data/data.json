			"body": "Recently I ported Conway's Game of Life (GOL) to [my AIoT board](?Post:102), as a practice. The rules of GOL are pretty simple [[src]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life):\n\n*   Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.\n*   Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.\n*   Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.\n*   Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.\n\nMore simple after translated to Python:\n\n```\n            if cell == 0:\n                if sum_neighbors == 3:\n                    cell = 1\n            else:\n                if sum_neighbors < 2 or sum_neighbors > 3:\n                    cell = 0\n```\n\nThanks to MicroPython, I don't need to compile my code every time after making some small changes. But microcontroller is with limit resources (CPU, MEM, etc) and normally doesn't have a full OS, also it's a new realm for me, when porting it to microcontroller, I encountered all kinds of bugs..\n\n* * *\n\nDebugging on microcontroller isn't as comfortable as on PC, so I also wrote a similar version on Jupyter Lab:\n\n```\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport matplotlib.animation as animation\nfrom IPython.display import HTML\nimport time\n\nWIDTH = 50\nHEIGHT = 50\nimg = np.random.randint(2,size=(WIDTH, HEIGHT)) * 200\n\nlist_neighbors = []\nfor i in [-1,0,1]:\n    for j in [-1,0,1]:\n        if (i, j) != (0, 0):\n            list_neighbors.append([i,j])\n\ndef sumNeighbors(x,y,img):\n    result = 0\n    for pair in list_neighbors:\n        position = [sum(i) for i in zip(pair,[x,y])]\n        if position[0] == -1:\n            position[0] = WIDTH - 1\n        if position[1] == -1:\n            position[1] = HEIGHT - 1\n        if position[0] == WIDTH:\n            position[0] = 0\n        if position[1] == HEIGHT:\n            position[1] = 0\n        #if img.get_pixel(position) != None:\n        #result += img.get_pixel(position)\n        result += img[position[0]][position[1]]\n    return result\n\ndef sumNeighbors2(img):\n    neighbor_up = np.vstack([ img[-1:, :], img[:-1, :] ])\n    neighbor_down = np.vstack([ img[1:, :], img[0:1, :] ])\n    neighbor_left = np.hstack([ img[:, -1:], img[:, :-1] ])\n    neighbor_right = np.hstack([ img[:, 1: ], img[:, 0:1] ])\n    neighbor_up_left = np.hstack([ neighbor_up[:, -1:], neighbor_up[:, :-1] ])\n    neighbor_up_right = np.hstack([ neighbor_up[:, 1: ], neighbor_up[:, 0:1] ])\n    neighbor_down_left = np.hstack([ neighbor_down[:, -1:], neighbor_down[:, :-1] ])\n    neighbor_down_right = np.hstack([ neighbor_down[:, 1: ], neighbor_down[:, 0:1] ])\n    return neighbor_up + neighbor_down + neighbor_left + neighbor_right + \\\n            neighbor_up_left + neighbor_up_right + neighbor_down_left + neighbor_down_right\n\ndef sumNeighbors3(img):\n    result = np.zeros((WIDTH+2, HEIGHT+2))\n    result[1:-1, 1:-1] = img[:, :]\n    result[0][0] = img[-1][-1]\n    result[0][-1] = img[-1][0]\n    result[-1][0] = img[0][-1]\n    result[-1][-1] = img[0][0]\n    result[0:1, 1:-1] = img[-1:, :]\n    result[-1, 1:-1] = img[0:1:, :]\n    result[1:-1, 0:1] = img[:, -1:]\n    result[1:-1, -1:] = img[:, 0:1]\n\n    return result[0:WIDTH, 0:HEIGHT] + result[0:WIDTH, 1:HEIGHT+1] + result[0:WIDTH, 2:] + \\\n            result[1:WIDTH+1, 0:HEIGHT] + result[1:WIDTH+1, 2:] + \\\n            result[2:, 0:HEIGHT] + result[2:, 1:HEIGHT+1] + result[2:, 2:]\n\nfig = plt.figure(figsize=(10, 10))\nims = []\nfor i in range(50):\n    img2 = img.copy()\n    sum_img_neighbor = sumNeighbors3(img)\n    for x in range(WIDTH):\n        for y in range(HEIGHT):\n            #sum_neighbors = sumNeighbors(x,y,img) ##\n            sum_neighbors = sum_img_neighbor[x,y]\n            if img[x][y] == 0:\n                if sum_neighbors == 600:\n                    img2[x][y] = 200\n            else:\n                if sum_neighbors < 400 or sum_neighbors > 600:\n                    img2[x][y] = 0\n    img = img2\n    im = plt.imshow(img2, animated=True)\n    ims.append([im])\n\nani = animation.ArtistAnimation(fig, ims, interval=100, blit=True, repeat_delay=1000)\nplt.close()\n\n# Show the animation\nHTML(ani.to_html5_video())\n```\n\nAs showed in the code, I wrote 3 versions of sumNeighbors(). In version 1 I simply iterate the image matrix and calculate the neighbors of every pixel, on Jupyter Lab the result is recorded as a video and no problem, but when porting it to my board, the animation is very slow, around 0.18 fps..\n\nBy referencing [https://scientific-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks_rst/0_Python/10_Examples/GameOfLife.html](https://scientific-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks_rst/0_Python/10_Examples/GameOfLife.html), I figured out that I can sum together 8 matrixes which represent each neighbor instead. But when searching `matrix` in the official doc of Maixpy, I found nothing.. Numpy is pretty large, I know. Then did a search `numpy micropython` with Searx, there is ulab ü•≥\n\n> ulab is a numpy-like module for micropython, meant to simplify and speed up common mathematical operations on arrays. The primary goal was to implement a small subset of numpy that might be useful in the context of a microcontroller. This means low-level data processing of linear (array) and two-dimensional (matrix) data.\n\n[https://micropython-ulab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ulab.html](https://micropython-ulab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ulab.html)\n\nIn Version 2 I use `vstack` and `hstack`, but they are not implemented in ulab, then version 3 came to my mind: by simply creating an extended matrix, not only less matrixes are needed, every matrix increases memory comsumption a lot, but also less CPU time is used for matrix operation üòÅ With version 3, the animation speeds up to around 2.45 fps.\n\n## Other lessons I learnt\n\n*   `if i != 0 and j != 0` != `if (i, j) != (0, 0)`, natural language logic fails to recognize the diff..\nOk.. that's De Morgan's laws, just failed to recall it >< [added on 080920]\n\n*   on the board matrix[x][y] failed to assign new value (`int` in my case), matrix[(x, y)] works. matrix[(x, y)] failed to compare with int, matrix[x][y] works.. actually the type of matrix[(x, y)] in ulab is narray.\n\n*   etc..\n\n## Code for Maixduino\n\n```\n## Game of Life for Maixduino\nimport sensor, lcd, image\nimport time\nimport ulab as np\n\nRATIO = 3 # the ratio of the screen to the size of image.\n\nclock = time.clock()\n#lcd.init(freq=15000000)\nlcd.init()\nlcd.set_backlight(0)\nsensor.reset()\nsensor.set_pixformat(sensor.GRAYSCALE)\nsensor.set_framesize(sensor.QVGA)\nsensor.run(1)\nimg = sensor.snapshot()\n#img = img.to_grayscale()\nsensor.run(0)\n\nWIDTH = img.width()//RATIO\nHEIGHT = img.height()//RATIO\n\nmatrix_data = np.zeros((WIDTH, HEIGHT), dtype=np.uint8)\n\nfor x in range(WIDTH):\n    for y in range(HEIGHT):\n        if img.get_pixel(x,y) % 2 == 0:\n            img.set_pixel(x,y,0)\n        else:\n            img.set_pixel(x,y,200)\n            matrix_data[(x,y)] = 1\nlcd.display(img)\n# img2 = img.copy(copy_to_fb=True) # just shallow copy\nimg = img.copy([0,0,WIDTH,HEIGHT])\nlcd.display(img)\n\ndef sumNeighbors3(matrix):\n    matrix_extended = np.zeros((WIDTH+2, HEIGHT+2), dtype=np.uint8)\n    matrix_extended[1:-1, 1:-1] = matrix[:, :]\n    matrix_extended[(0,0)] = matrix[(-1,-1)]\n    matrix_extended[(0,-1)] = matrix[(-1,0)]\n    matrix_extended[(-1,0)] = matrix[(0,-1)]\n    matrix_extended[(-1,-1)] = matrix[(0,0)]\n\n    matrix_extended[0:1, 1:-1] = matrix[-1:, :]\n    matrix_extended[-1, 1:-1] = matrix[0:1:, :]\n    matrix_extended[1:-1, 0:1] = matrix[:, -1:]\n    matrix_extended[1:-1, -1:] = matrix[:, 0:1]\n\n    return matrix_extended[0:WIDTH, 0:HEIGHT] + matrix_extended[0:WIDTH, 1:HEIGHT+1] + \\\n            matrix_extended[0:WIDTH, 2:] + matrix_extended[1:WIDTH+1, 0:HEIGHT] + \\\n            matrix_extended[1:WIDTH+1, 2:] + matrix_extended[2:, 0:HEIGHT] + \\\n            matrix_extended[2:, 1:HEIGHT+1] + matrix_extended[2:, 2:]\n\nwhile True:\n    clock.tick()\n\n    ## Surrounding3\n    matrix_sum_neighbors = sumNeighbors3(matrix_data)\n    img.clear()\n    for x in range(WIDTH):\n        for y in range(HEIGHT):\n            sum_neighbors = matrix_sum_neighbors[x][y]\n            if matrix_data[x][y] == 0:\n                if sum_neighbors == 3:\n                    matrix_data[(x,y)] = 1\n                    img.set_pixel(x,y,200)\n            else:\n                if sum_neighbors < 2 or sum_neighbors > 3:\n                    matrix_data[(x,y)] = 0\n                    img.set_pixel(x,y,0)\n    fps = clock.fps()\n    img.draw_string(2,2, (\"%2.4ffps\" %(fps)), color=200, scale=2, mono_space=False)\n    lcd.display(img)\n```"

This is related to, but is distinct from, complex analysis, which concerns the analysis of the complex numbers and complex functions, harmonic analysis, which concerns the analysis of harmonics (waves) such as sine waves, and how they synthesize other functions via the Fourier transform, functional analysis, which focuses much more heavily on functions (and how they form things like vector spaces), and so forth.\nPage 019\nThere is a certain philosophical satisfaction in knowing why things work, but a pragmatic person may argue that one only needs to know how things work to do real-life problems.\nPage 019\nyou can certainly use things like the chain rule, L‚ÄôHÀÜopital‚Äôs rule, or integration by parts without knowing why these rules work, or whether there are any exceptions to these rules. However, one can get into trouble if\nPage 020\none applies rules without knowing where they came from and what the limits of their applicability are\nPage 028\nThe analysis you learn in this text will help you resolve these questions, and will let you know when these rules (and others) are justified, and when they are illegal, thus separating the useful applications of these rules from the nonsense. Thus they can prevent you from making mistakes, and can help you place these rules in a wider context. Moreover, as you learn analysis you will develop an ‚Äúanalytical way of thinking‚Äù, which will help you whenever you come into contact with any new rules of mathematics, or when dealing with situations which are not quite covered by the standard rules,\nPage 029\nYou will develop a sense of why a rule in mathematics (e.g., the chain rule) works, how to adapt it to new situations, and what its limitations (if any) are; this will allow you to apply the mathematics you have already learnt more confidently and correctly\nPage 030\nThis is not an arbitrary choice of rule; it can be proven from more primitive, and more fundamental, properties of the number system.\nPage 031\nWe will try to introduce these concepts one at a time and identify explicitly what our assumptions are as we go along - and not allow ourselves to use more ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù tricks such as the rules of algebra until we have actually proven them. This may seem like an irritating constraint, especially as we will spend a lot of time proving statements which are ‚Äúobvious‚Äù, but it is necessary to do this suspension of known facts to avoid circularity\nPage 031\nthe results here may seem trivial, but the journey is much more important than the destination, for now.\nPage 033\nwe can define complicated operations in terms of simpler operations.\nPage 033\nincrementing seems to be a fundamental operation, not reducible to any simpler operation\nPage 034\nIt may seem that this is enough to describe the natural numbers. However, we have not pinned down completely the behavior of N even with our new axiom, it is still possible that our number system behaves in other pathological ways\nPage 036\nBecause this axiom refers not just to variables, but also properties, it is of a different nature than the other four axioms;\nPage 037\ntechnically be called an axiom schema rather than an axiom - it is a template for producing an (infinite) number of axioms\nPage 038\nA remarkable accomplishment of modern analysis is that just by starting from these five very primitive axioms, and some additional axioms from set theory, we can build all the other number systems, create functions, and do all the algebra and calculus that we are used to.\nPage 039\nNote that our definition of the natural numbers is axiomatic rather than constructive. We have not told you what the natural numbers are (so we do not address such questions as what the numbers are made of, are they physical objects, what do they measure, etc.) - we have only listed some things you can do with them (in fact, the only operation we have defined on them right now is the increment one) and some of the properties that they have. This is how mathematics works - it treats its objects abstractly, caring only about what properties the objects have, not what the objects are or what they mean.\nPage 039\nthere are multiple ways to construct a working model of the natural numbers, and it is pointless, at least from a mathematician‚Äôs standpoint, as to argue about which model is the ‚Äútrue‚Äù one\nPage 039\nHistorically, the realization that numbers could be treated axiomatically is very recent, not much more than a hundred years old. Before then, numbers were generally understood to be inextricably connected to some external concept, such as counting the cardinality of a set, measuring the length of a line segment, or the mass of a physical object, etc. This worked reasonably well, until one was forced to move from one number system to another;\nPage 039\nthus each great advance in the theory of numbers - negative numbers, irrational numbers, complex numbers, even the number zero - led to a lot of unnecessary philosophical anguish\nPage 040\na mathematician can use any of these models when it is convenient, to aid his or her intuition and understanding, but they can also be just as easily discarded when they begin to get in the way.\nPage 040\nBy using all the axioms together we will now conclude that this procedure will give a single value to the sequence element an for each natural number n. More precisely3:\nPage 040\nProposition 2.1.16 (Recursive definitions)\nPage 044\nOnce we have a notion of addition, we can begin defining a notion of order.\nPage 045\nThe properties of order allow one to obtain a stronger version of the principle of induction\nPage 048\nNow that we have the familiar operations of addition and multiplication, the more primitive notion of increment will begin to fall by the wayside, and we will see it rarely from now on.\nPage 051\nThere is a special case of set theory, called ‚Äúpure set theory‚Äù, in which all objects are sets\nPage 051\nFrom a logical point of view, pure set theory is a simpler theory, since one only has to deal with sets and not with objects; however, from a conceptual point of view it is often easier to deal with impure set theories in which some objects are not considered to be sets. The two types of theories are more or less equivalent for the purposes of doing mathematics, and so we shall take an agnostic position as to whether all objects are sets or not.\nPage 051\nIf A is not a set, we leave the statement x ‚àà A undefined; for instance, we consider the statement 3 ‚àà 4 to neither be true or false, but simply meaningless, since 4 is not a set\nPage 057\nAxiom 3.5 (Axiom of specification). Let A be a set, and for each x ‚àà A, let P(x) be a property pertaining to x (i.e., P(x) is either a true statement or a false statement). Then there exists a set, called {x ‚àà A : P(x) is true} (or simply {x ‚àà A : P(x)} for short), whose elements are precisely the elements x in A for which P(x) is true. In other words, for any object y, y ‚àà {x ‚àà A : P(x) is true} ‚áê‚áí (y ‚àà A and P(y) is true). This axiom is also known as the axiom of separation.\nPage 058\nRemark 3.1.26\\. By the way, one should be careful with the English word ‚Äúand‚Äù: rather confusingly, it can mean either union or intersection, depending on context. For instance, if one talks about a set of ‚Äúboys and girls‚Äù, one means the union of a set of boys with a set of girls, but if one talks about the set of people who are single and male, then one means the intersection of the set of single people with the set of male people. (Can you work out the rule of grammar that determines when ‚Äúand‚Äù means union and when ‚Äúand‚Äù means intersection?)\nPage 064\nThe problem with the above axiom is that it creates sets which are far too ‚Äúlarge‚Äù - for instance, we can use that axiom to talk about the set of all objects (a so-called ‚Äúuniversal set‚Äù). Since sets are themselves objects (Axiom 3.1), this means that sets are allowed to contain themselves, which is a somewhat silly state of affairs.\nPage 065\nExercise 3.2.1\\. Show that the universal specification axiom, Axiom 3.8, if assumed to be true, would imply Axioms 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, and 3.6\\. (If we assume that all natural numbers are objects, we also obtain Axiom 3.7.) Thus, this axiom, if permitted, would simplify the foundations of set theory tremendously (and can be viewed as one basis for an intuitive model of set theory known as ‚Äúnaive set theory‚Äù). Unfortunately, as we have seen, Axiom 3.8 is ‚Äútoo good to be true‚Äù!\nPage 065\nif Axiom 3.8 is true, then a universal set exists, and conversely, if a universal set exists, then Axiom 3.8 is true.\nPage 071\nThe concepts of injectivity and surjectivity are in many ways dual to each other\nPage 072\nIf f is bijective, then for every y ‚àà Y , there is exactly one x such that f(x) = y (there is at least one because of surjectivity, and at most one because of injectivity).\nPage 077\nZermelo-Fraenkel-Choice (ZFC ) axioms of set theory\nPage 081\nAlso, the empty Cartesian product 1‚â§i‚â§0 Xi gives, not the empty set {}, but rather the singleton set {()} whose only element is the 0-tuple (), also known as the empty tuple.\nPage 084\nExercise 3.5.13\\. The purpose of this exercise is to show that there is essentially only one version of the natural number system in set theory\nPage 085\nthe Peano axiom approach treats natural numbers more like ordinals than cardinals. (The cardinals are One, Two, Three, ..., and are used to count how many things there are in a set. The ordinals are First, Second, Third, ..., and are used to order a sequence of objects. There is a subtle difference between the two, especially when comparing infinite cardinals with infinite ordinals, but this is beyond the scope of this text).\nPage 091\nthis definition is circular because it requires a notion of subtraction, which we can only adequately define once the integers are constructed\nPage 091\nWe still have to resolve (c). To get around this problem we will use the following work-around: we will temporarily write integers not as a difference a ‚àí b, but instead use a new notation a‚àí‚àíb to define integers, where the ‚àí‚àí is a meaningless place-holder\nPage 106\nIt is often useful to think of the notion of ‚ÄúŒµ-close‚Äù as an approximate substitute for that of equality in analysis.\nPage 111\nYou are of course free to design your own number system, possibly including one where division by zero is permitted; but you will have to give up one or more of the field axioms from Proposition 4.2.4, among other things, and you will probably get a less useful number system in which to do any real-world problems.\nPage 112\nThe procedure we give here of obtaining the real numbers as the limit of sequences of rational numbers may seem rather complicated. However, it is in fact an instance of a very general and useful procedure, that of completing one metric space to form another\nPage 131\nwhile positive real numbers can be arbitrarily large or small, they cannot be larger than all of the positive integers, or smaller in magnitude than all of the positive rationals\nPage 131 Á°¨‰ª∂ÁöÑÊ•µÈôêÔºö\nProposition 5.4.12 (Bounding of reals by rationals). Let x be a positive real number. Then there exists a positive rational number q such that q ‚â§ x, and there exists a positive integer N such that x ‚â§ N\nPage 139\nProposition 5.6.3\\. All the properties in Propositions 4.3.10 and 4.3.12 remain valid if x and y are assumed to be real numbers instead of rational numbers. Instead of giving an actual proof of this proposition, we shall give a meta-proof (an argument appealing to the nature of proofs, rather than the nature of real and rational numbers)\nPage 146\nWe sometimes use the phrase ‚Äúan ‚Üí x as n ‚Üí ‚àû‚Äù as an alternate way of writing the statement ‚Äú(an)‚àû n=m converges to x‚Äù. Bear in mind, though, that the individual statements an ‚Üí x and n ‚Üí ‚àû do not have any rigorous meaning; this phrase is just a convention\nPage 146\nThe notation limn‚Üí‚àû an does not give any indication about the starting index m of the sequence, but the starting index is irrelevant\nPage 147\nConvergent sequences are Cauchy\nPage 152\nTo avoid these issues we shall simply not define any arithmetic operations on the extended real number system other than negation and order.\nPage 158\nLimits are of course a special case of limit points\nPage 161\nLet c be a real number. If (an)‚àû n=m converges to c, then we must have L+ = L‚àí = c. Conversely, if L+ = L‚àí = c, then (an)‚àû n=m converges to c.\nPage 163\nTheorem 6.4.18 (Completeness of the reals). A sequence (an)‚àû n=1 of real numbers is a Cauchy sequence if and only if it is convergent.\nPage 163\nRemark 6.4.19\\. Note that while this is very similar in spirit to Proposition 6.1.15, it is a bit more general, since Proposition 6.1.15 refers to Cauchy sequences of rationals instead of real numbers\nPage 164\ndoing analysis (taking limits, taking derivatives and integrals, finding zeroes of functions, that kind of thing\nPage 164\nIn the language of metric spaces (see Chapter B.2), Theorem 6.4.18 asserts that the real numbers are a complete metric space - that they do not contain ‚Äúholes‚Äù the same way the rationals do.\nPage 164\n(Certainly the rationals have lots of Cauchy sequences which do not converge to other rationals; take for instance the sequence 1, 1.4, 1.41, 1.414, 1.4142,... which converges to the irrational ‚àö2.)\nPage 168\nTheorem 6.6.8 (Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem). Let (an)‚àû n=0 be a bounded sequence (i.e., there exists a real number M > 0 such that |an| ‚â§ M for all n ‚àà N). Then there is at least one subsequence of (an)‚àû n=0 which converges.\nPage 168\nThe Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem says that if a sequence is bounded, then eventually it has no choice but to converge in some places; it has ‚Äúno room‚Äù to spread out and stop itself from acquiring limit points.\nPage 168\nIn the language of topology, this means that the interval {x ‚àà R : ‚àíM ‚â§ x ‚â§ M} is compact, whereas an unbounded set such as the real line R is not compact.\nPage 173\nThe difference between ‚Äúsum‚Äù and ‚Äúseries‚Äù is a subtle linguistic one. Strictly speaking, a series is an expression of the form n i=m ai; this series is mathematically (but not semantically) equal to a real number, which is then the sum of that series.\nPage 177\noften abbreviate x‚àà{y‚ààX:P(y) is true} f(x) as x‚ààX:P(x) is true f(x) or even as P(x) is true f(x)\nPage 181\nthe notation am +am+1 +am+2 +... is of course designed to look very suggestively like a sum, but is not actually a finite sum because of the ‚Äú...‚Äù symbol.\nPage 183\nThis Proposition, by itself, is not very handy, because it is not so easy to compute the partial sums q n=p an in practice. However, it has a number of useful corollaries.\nPage 184 A clue for the weird relationship between absolutely convergent and conditionally convergent.\nProposition 7.2.12 (Alternating series test). Let (an)‚àû n=m be a sequence of real numbers which are non-negative and decreasing, thus an ‚â• 0 and an ‚â• an+1 for every n ‚â• m. Then the series ‚àû n=m(‚àí1)nan is convergent if and only if the sequence an converges to 0 as n ‚Üí ‚àû.\nPage 187\nCorollary 7.3.2 (Comparison test)\nPage 187 useful for understanding series\nin fact ‚àû n=m an ‚â§ ‚àû n=m |an| ‚â§ ‚àû n=m bn.\nPage 188 We have the proof, but how actually Cauchy got such an unusual result, by his intuition?\nCauchy criterion\nPage 188\nLemma 7.3.3 (Geometric series). Let x be a real number. If |x| ‚â• 1, then the series ‚àû n=0 xn is divergent. If however |x| < 1, then the series is absolutely convergent and ‚àû n=0 xn = 1/(1 ‚àí x)\nPage 188\nProposition 7.3.4 (Cauchy criterion). Let (an)‚àû n=1 be a decreasing sequence of non-negative real numbers (so an ‚â• 0 and an+1 ‚â§ an for all n ‚â• 1). Then the series ‚àû n=1 an is convergent if and only if the series ‚àû k=0 2ka2k = a1 + 2a2 + 4a4 + 8a8 + ... is convergent.\nPage 188\nAn interesting feature of this criterion is that it only uses a small number of elements of the sequence\nPage 190\nthe series ‚àû n=1 1/n (also known as the harmonic series) is divergent, as claimed earlier. However, the series ‚àû n=1 1/n2 is convergent.\nPage 190\nThe quantity ‚àû n=1 1/nq, when it converges, is called Œ∂(q), the Riemann-zeta function of q.\nPage 193\nwhen the series is not absolutely convergent, then the rearrangements are very badly behaved.\nPage 194 It means the criterion whether a series can be rearranged is not clear, or still not found.\nThis is not to say that rearranging a series that is not absolutely convergent necessarily gives you the wrong answer\nPage 194\nThis is not to say that rearranging a series that is not absolutely convergent necessarily gives you the wrong answer - for instance, in theoretical physics one often performs similar maneuvres, and one still (usually) obtains a correct answer at the end - but doing so is risky\nPage 197\nCorollary 7.5.3 (Ratio test). Let ‚àû n=m an be a series of nonzero numbers. (The non-zero hypothesis is required so that the ratios |an+1|/|an| appearing below are well-defined.) ‚Ä¢ If lim supn‚Üí‚àû |an+1| |an| < 1, then the series ‚àû n=m an is absolutely convergent (hence conditionally convergent). ‚Ä¢ If lim infn‚Üí‚àû |an+1| |an| > 1, then the series ‚àû n=m an is not conditionally convergent (and thus cannot be absolutely convergent). ‚Ä¢ In the remaining cases, we cannot assert any conclusion.\nPage 198\nA set X is said to be countably infinite (or just countable) iff it has equal cardinality with the natural numbers N. A set X is said to be at most countable iff it is either countable or finite.\nPage 199\na countable set can be arranged in a sequence\nPage 199\ncountable sets are infinite\nPage 204\nThe rationals Q are countable.\nPage 204\nit is quite difficult (though not impossible) to actually try and come up with an explicit sequence a0, a1,... for Q.\nPage 210\nLemma 8.2.7\\. Let ‚àû n=0 an be a series of real numbers which is conditionally convergent, but not absolutely convergent. Define the sets A+ := {n ‚àà N : an ‚â• 0} and A‚àí := {n ‚àà N : an < 0}, thus A+ ‚à™ A‚àí = N and A+ ‚à© A‚àí = ‚àÖ. Then both of the series n‚ààA+ an and n‚ààA‚àí an are not conditionally convergent (and thus not absolutely convergent).\nPage 210\na series which converges conditionally but not absolutely can be rearranged to converge to any value\nPage 212\n(Cantor‚Äôs theorem). Let X be an arbitrary set (finite or infinite). Then the sets X and 2X cannot have equal cardinality.\nPage 214\nOne could ask whether there exist any sets which have strictly larger cardinality than the natural numbers, but strictly smaller cardinality than the reals. The Continuum Hypothesis asserts that no such sets exist. Interestingly, it was shown in separate works of Kurt G¬®odel (1906‚Äì 1978) and Paul Cohen (1934‚Äì2007) that this hypothesis is independent of the other axioms of set theory;\nPage 215 Then can we build another axiom system so that we can prove it?\nit can neither be proved nor disproved in that set of axioms (unless those axioms are inconsistent, which is highly unlikely).\nPage 216\nOne reason for this confidence is a theorem due to the great logician Kurt G¬®odel, who showed that a result proven using the axiom of choice will never contradict a result proven without the axiom of choice (unless all the other axioms of set theory are themselves inconsistent, which is highly unlikely)\nPage 216\nMore precisely, G¬®odel demonstrated that the axiom of choice is undecidable; it can neither be proved nor disproved from the other axioms of set theory, so long as those axioms are themselves consistent.\nPage 216\n‚Äúreal-life‚Äù application of analysis (more precisely, any application involving only ‚Äúdecidable‚Äù questions)\nPage 217\nAxiom 8.1 (Choice). Let I be a set, and for each Œ± ‚àà I, let XŒ± be a non-empty set. Then Œ±‚ààI XŒ± is also non-empty. In other words, there exists a function (xŒ±)Œ±‚ààI which assigns to each Œ± ‚àà I an element xŒ± ‚àà XŒ±.\nPage 217\nthe axiom of choice can lead to proofs which are non-constructive - demonstrating existence of an object without actually constructing the object explicitly\nPage 219\nStrictly speaking, a partially ordered set is not a set X, but rather a pair (X, ‚â§X)\nPage 223\nLemma 8.5.15 (Zorn‚Äôs lemma). Let X be a non-empty partially ordered set, with the property that every totally ordered subset Y of X has an upper bound. Then X contains at least one maximal element.\nPage 224\nZorn‚Äôs lemma (also called the principle of transfinite induction)\nPage 226 In real world infinity may not exisit, so the theory concerning infinity is over-simulating, but we can't (easily/exactly) count the amount, so we use infinity as a tool for suggesting a virtual upper bound.\nlogically equivalent to the axiom of choice\nPage 226\nwell ordering principle: every set X has at least one well-ordering.\nPage 226\nif Hausdorff‚Äôs maximality principle is true, then Zorn‚Äôs lemma is true. Tthus by Exercise 8.5.17,\nPage 226\nWe thus see that the axiom of choice, Zorn‚Äôs lemma, and the well-ordering principle are all logically equivalent to each other.\nPage 226\nthe cardinality of any two sets is comparable, as long as one assumes the axiom of choice.\nPage 229\nthe real line R itself is the open interval (‚àí‚àû, +‚àû), while the extended real line R‚àó is the closed interval [‚àí‚àû, +‚àû].\nPage 230\nThe closure of X, sometimes denoted X is defined to be the set of all the adherent points of X.\nPage 230\nLet X be a subset of R, and let x ‚àà R. We say that x is an adherent point of X iff it is Œµ-adherent to X for every Œµ > 0.\nPage 231\nThe closure of Q is R\nPage 232\nN, Z, R, ‚àÖ are closed, while Q is not.\nPage 232\nthe set of adherent points splits into the set of limit points and the set of isolated points\nPage 233\nHeine-Borel theorem for the line\nPage 233\nThis theorem shall play a key rÀÜole in subsequent sections of this chapter. In the language of metric space topology, it asserts that every subset of the real line which is closed and bounded, is also compact\nPage 236\nOne can certainly study a function through its graph, by using the geometry of the plane R2 (e.g., employing such concepts as tangent lines, area, and so forth). We however will pursue a more ‚Äúanalytic‚Äù approach, in which we rely instead on the properties of the real numbers to analyze these functions. The two approaches are complementary; the geometric approach offers more visual intuition, while the analytic approach offers rigour and precision.\nPage 261\nThe difference between uniform continuity and continuity is that in uniform continuity one can take a single Œ¥ which works for all x0 ‚àà X; for ordinary continuity, each x0 ‚àà X might use a different Œ¥.\nPage 264\nif the domain of the function is a closed interval, then continuous functions are in fact uniformly continuous\nPage 268\nthese definitions can be modified to handle functions of several variables, or functions whose values are vectors instead of scalar. Furthermore, one‚Äôs geometric intuition becomes difficult to rely on once one has more than three dimensions in play. (Conversely, one can use one‚Äôs experience in analytic rigour to extend one‚Äôs geometric intuition to such abstract settings; as mentioned earlier, the two viewpoints complement rather than oppose each other.)\nPage 268\nf is differentiable at x0 on X with derivative L\nPage 270\nwe will refrain from using the notation df dx whenever it could possibly lead to confusion. (This confusion becomes even worse in the calculus of several variables, and the standard notation of ‚àÇf ‚àÇx can lead to some serious ambiguities\nPage 273\nIf one writes y for f(x), and z for g(y), then the chain rule can be written in the more visually appealing manner dz dx = dz dy dy dx . However, this notation can be misleading (for instance it blurs the distinction between dependent variable and independent variable, especially for y), and leads one to believe that the quantities dz, dy, dx can be manipulated like real numbers. However, these quantities are not real numbers (in fact, we have not assigned any meaning to them at all)\nPage 273\nIt is possible to think of dy, dx, etc. as ‚Äúinfinitesimal real numbers‚Äù if one knows what one is doing, but for those just starting out in analysis, I would not recommend this approach, especially if one wishes to work rigorously. (There is a way to make all of this rigorous, even for the calculus of several variables, but it requires the notion of a tangent vector, and the derivative map, both of which are beyond the scope of this text.)\nPage 275\nLocal extrema are stationary\nPage 295\nCompare this definition to the relationship between the lim sup, lim inf, and limit of a sequence an that was established in Proposition 6.4.12(f); the lim sup is always greater than or equal to the lim inf, but they are only equal when the sequence converges, and in this case they are both equal to the limit of the sequence. The definition given above may differ from the definition you may have encountered in your calculus courses, based on Riemann sums. However, the two definitions turn out to be equivalent\nPage 296\nThe restriction J = ‚àÖ is required because the quantities infx‚ààJ f(x) and supx‚ààJ f(x) are infinite (or negative infinite) if J is empty.\nPage 305\nThis gives a large class of Riemann integrable functions already; the bounded continuous functions. But we can expand this class a little more, to include the bounded piecewise continuous functions.\nPage 312\nWe now have enough machinery to connect integration and differentiation via the familiar fundamental theorem of calculus\nPage 319\nthe advantage of the Riemann-Stieltjes integral is that it still makes sense even when Œ± is not differentiable.\nPage 322\nThe big advantage of writing logically, however, is that one can be absolutely sure that your conclusion will be correct, as long as all your hypotheses were correct and your steps were logical; using other styles of writing one can be reasonably convinced that something is true, but there is a difference between being convinced and being sure."

At first I began to actively move my neck and change sitting style, but the pain got worse, then I changed my chair so that my neck could get supported by the chairback. It helped in the beginning though neck pain never went away in daily life, but months later I even felt uncomfortable when sitting with that chair.. so the problem slowly got more and more severe in a course I even couldn't sense ><\n\nOne solution is pretty simple and effective, just do not sit when using pc XD Afaik it's now popular in some offices, though searching online there are quite some debates about sitting vs standing.. Also when watching the documentary \"The Rise and Rise of Bitcoin\" (2014), such a scene caught my eyes:\n\n![Bildschirmfoto_2018-08-19_15-41-24.png.jpg (0x0)](data/img/post_91_Bildschirmfoto_2018-08-19_15-41-24.png.jpg)\n\nEven so neck pain is a complex common problem, and one single solution probably can't get rid of it. Here are some other ideas I found:\n\n*   change lifestyle and prevent from keeping sitting or using pc for too long time, or just have a more regular schedule of daily life. Changing work environment, taking a big break like travel, do sth completely different from daily life should be helpful, too.\n\n*   cool down overheating organs like using a wet and cool towel to absord heat from head, neck.\n\n*   do daily [Tai chi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tai_chi) [[Kiwipedia mirror]](/1KiwiBCVBUcuypVm8FEmUW9YT6fJDXkN9r/?/article-history/en/tai-chi). [Yoga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoga) [[Kiwipedia mirror]](/1KiwiBCVBUcuypVm8FEmUW9YT6fJDXkN9r/?/article-history/en/yoga) is probably a perfect practice for curing such a problem, and dancing should help, too. Growing more muscle in the back may be another nice idea.\n\n*   use E-ink screen instead of LED. CLEARink is another promising tech [[1]](https://goodereader.com/blog/e-paper/clearink-receives-a-10-million-dollar-deal-to-provide-screens-for-tablets) [[2]](https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=294531).\n\n*   use more often ears instead of eyes for getting information.\n\n![become_a_better_developer.jpe (0x0)](data/img/post_91_become_a_better_developer.jpe)"

Currently ZeroNet only has a third party [CDN zite](/1AMh6MG4K59ki1dPXX1PrgzeeqkMmZ1YKm), but I don't know if any zite used/is using it. There is also [CodeR](/1CodEr7T9xNXSPcwbsvf5fHTqsixDMwDzL/), which hosts quite many popular libraries and works as jsfiddle alternative, you may like to check out this [beautiful particletrain](/1CodEr7T9xNXSPcwbsvf5fHTqsixDMwDzL/?1vQZSbsXn2DZ3ysNBEuA54ZioDZLRk9vy/2) by Nofish. One of ZeroNet's greatness is lightweight (as my main node is [in a Rasperry Pi 2](?Post:2), and IPFS is now stuck as a resource hog afaik), but still all official zites and many popular zites are using same/similiar libraries, but they need to have their own replica and can't share them.\n\nThink it's a good idea (iirc some fellows on ZeroNet mentioned it before) to have an useful/official/popular CDN zite, but to prevent bad things happening, e.g. an evil hacker hacked the pc of the owner of the CDN zite, got the private key, changed/deleted part of it and crashed half of ZeroNet (like [this Nodejs example](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/03/23/npm_left_pad_chaos/)), it's better that this CDN zite is blockchain-like:\n\n1.  the owner/moderator of it can only add new version/lib/content, but can't delete old version. There is already [a POC blockchain-based zite](/142jqssVAj2iRxMACJg2dzipB5oicZYz5w/?Topic:1517355233_1Cz74bvSRgWqHaLCBUTrJPW7uvKyr8P8RC) btw.\n\n2.  it can't be deleted.\n\n3.  except some core libs, most libs are optional, so not all users need to host all libs (like ZeroID zite, archived json data files are optional).\n\n3 is probably easy, 1 and 2 need extra implementation. Guess it's also ok that by default all users pause the CDN zite, and only add new files/libs if a new zite requests it, and when updating the CDN zite, there is a checking algorithm that prevents bad things from happening."

			"body": "For [celebrating](/Talk.ZeroNetwork.bit/?Topic:1527279034_1NkRbczBVD8gsCG5PMsS1b2gN63srsqYvp/Happy+GDPR+day+everybody) [Android receiving a court complaint](http://blog.fefe.de/?ts=a5f6d917) that is worth ‚Ç¨3.7 billion because of GDPR, write some of my Android experience and self-defense guide~\n\nI started using Android (as a toy but not as a phone :3) with a second-hand Acer Liquid A1 (OS version is probably 2.1 [[ref]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acer_Liquid_A1)) in 2010 and at that time I still had no any concept about personal data and privacy. I was using Nokia (N73, 5800) as my main phone and later switched to Blackberry (9700, Q10). My second Android phone is the one I'm holding now - YotaPhone 2, which was bought in Aug. 2016.\n\nAnd now begins the guide :3\n\n* * *\n\nFor protecting our privacy, what we need to do is to restrict Internet connection of ~~some~~ many evil components of the Android system, then use only [FLOSS apps](https://f-droid.org/) if possible.\n\nFor non-rooted phone, there is [NetGuard](https://f-droid.org/packages/eu.faircode.netguard/):\n\n> NetGuard provides simple and advanced ways to block access to the internet - no root required.\n> \n> Applications and addresses can individually be allowed or denied access to your Wi-Fi and/or mobile connection.\n\nBut from [its Github FAQ page](https://github.com/M66B/NetGuard/blob/master/FAQ.md):\n\n> (1) Can NetGuard completely protect my privacy?\n> \n> No - nothing can completely protect your privacy. NetGuard will do its best, but it is limited by the fact it must use the VPN service. This is the trade-off required to make a firewall which does not require root access. The firewall can only start when Android \"allows\" it to start, so it will not offer protection during early boot-up (although you can disable your network before rebooting). It will, however, be much better than nothing.\n> \n> Android N and later allows NetGuard to be an Always-On VPN. On Android O do not enable 'Block connections without VPN', see question 51) for more information on this.\n> \n> To protect yourself more, remember to disable Wi-Fi and mobile data before rebooting, and only enable them on reboot, after the firewall service has started (and the key icon is visible in the status bar).\n\nYep, there is sth called startup data leak, and for non-rooted phone a user needs to disable Wi-Fi and mobile data everytime before rebooting to avoid it..\n\nFor rooted phone, there is [AFWall+](https://f-droid.org/packages/dev.ukanth.ufirewall/)\n\nUnder 3-dot menu > Experimental Preferences:\n\n> Fix startup data leak\n> Prevent data leaks during system startup. Your ROM must have init.d or su.d (superSU) support. HTC devices must be configured for S-OFF.\n\nThis feature has been experiemental for more than 1 year btw..\n\nAlso I know a proprietary app called [Lightningwall](http://apk.defim.de/app/lightningwall/), in default it fixes startup data leak and requires Xposed framework. It doesn't require Internet Access permission, so probably a fine choice.\n\nThat's all, protecting our privacy in Android phone is that simple, isn't it :D\n\nActually there are a lot of other things that can be done. You may find some clues from the small note I created after bought and heavily tweaked my Yotaphone 2 :3\n\n======\n\nRecently bought my first Android phone (Actually I had an Acer liquid A1 in 2010, but I didn't use it as a phone :P also I'm with my third Android tablet ~). Blackberry said they won't develop Android phone until it's secure enough. Well, I likewise but won't use Android as Phone until I can defense my privacy enough ~\n\nSo here are the things I have done:\n\n*   unlock bootloader, install TWRP and flash SuperSU (Later may try [this one](https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdfilter=superuser&fdid=me.phh.superuser)), also flash xposed framework.\n\n*   Install Busybox and System App Mover from F-droid and delete all the system apps I can delete, like those from _*_. Actually after moving a lot of system apps my phone can't boot into UI again :3 but I survived it after manually deleted them from /data/app/, also my phone was shipped with Lollipop, so here I also install Laucher3 from F-Droid before delete the default UI. Then find alternatives from F-Droid, examples are Opencamera, QKSMS, Simple Gallery, OSMAND~, Icecat Mobile, VLC, Vanilla Music, Hacker's Keyboard.\n\n*   install Xposed Installer and then Prevent Running 2.3.2, AppOpsXposed from it. Install AFWall+, OS Monitor, Autostarts, Network Log, Application Info, Kernel Adiutor from F-droid. Then tweak, tweak, tweak ...\n\n*   Install GravityBox, Physical Button Music Control 3.0.5 Beta, Xposed Additions from Xposed Installer and tweak ...\n\n*   Other interesting apps I have installed\n\n    From F-Droid: Twidere, Activity Launcher, Hayai Launcher, Kiwix, Notification Notes, Permissions, Pixel Dungeon, QuickLyric, Search Based Launcher, SmartNavi, Tint Browser, Wikipedia, uNote\n\n    From Xposed Installer: Fix Lollipop Memory Leak, MobileRadioActiveFix\n\n======\n\nBut in the end, any bored IT student in your next room could easily hack your phone when there was a new interesting 0-day bug.. So.. please support Linux Phone projects like [PostMarket OS](https://www.postmarketos.org/) and [Librem 5](https://puri.sm/shop/librem-5/) :D"

For the custom feature, currently only official zites are well supported, other zites will be gradually polished. A light theme is also included, but I will only maintain it for official zites, it would be nice if someone maintained the light version for other zites. Some zites may have side effects, that some bright elements are still not changed. You can try it yourself, ask me to modify them or temporarily disable the theme.\n\nThis theme is implemented as a userstyle, needs [Stylus](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus) or [Stylish](https://github.com/stylish-userstyles/stylish) (ver. 2.0.x) addon. ~~Because of [a bug](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/issues/215) in Firefox > 57, so only Firefox < 56 + Stylish (ver. 2.0.x) and Chrome + Stylus are supported.~~ [[Edit]](#edit-) The new version of Stylish addon is not recommended, as it is not opensource, collects user data and even violates GPL license, for details please take a look at [the comments](/1EiMAqhd6sMjPG2tznkkGXxhdwFBDdeqT9/?Post:3) in this article.\n\n* * *\n\n## How to install:\n\nIf you use Firefox (version < 57) and Stylish 2.xx, in the `Manage Styles` Setting you can choose `Install from URLs`, then simply copy [this link](/1EiMAqhd6sMjPG2tznkkGXxhdwFBDdeqT9/shared/zeronet-dark-theme-next.userstyle.css) and install it.\n\nIf you use Stylus, under `Manage` page, use `Import styles` and import [this file](/1EiMAqhd6sMjPG2tznkkGXxhdwFBDdeqT9/shared/zeronet-dark-theme-for-import.json), then click the update button to update it to the lastet version. You can also set up auto-update interval under `Options UI`.\n\nIf you use remote server mode or clearnet proxy and your ZeroNet address is not `127.0.0.1:43110`, you need to change the addresses below in the json file.\n\n```\n...\n    \"updateUrl\": \"http://127.0.0.1:43110/1EiMAqhd6sMjPG2tznkkGXxhdwFBDdeqT9/shared/zeronet-dark-theme.userstyle.json\",\n    \"md5Url\": \"http://127.0.0.1:43110/1EiMAqhd6sMjPG2tznkkGXxhdwFBDdeqT9/shared/zeronet-dark-theme.userstyle.md5\",\n    \"url\": \"http://127.0.0.1:43110/1EiMAqhd6sMjPG2tznkkGXxhdwFBDdeqT9/?Post:3:A+Dark+Theme+For+ZeroNet\",\n...\n```\n\nIn another way you can create a new theme and choose import Mozilla Format from the left panel, then copy & paste the content of [this link](/1EiMAqhd6sMjPG2tznkkGXxhdwFBDdeqT9/shared/zeronet-dark-theme-next.userstyle.css), but you need to manually repeat these steps for update.\n\n## How to customize:\n\nFrom the addon button choose to edit the theme. Currently there are 6 themes (palettes): default, Deep Sky, Deep Forest, Dark Golden Earth, Mastodon and a light theme named Old Book.\n\nthe palette format looks like:\n\n```\n:root {\n--bgd1: #101010;\n--bgd2: #181818;\n--ctn1: #1f1f1f;\n--ctn2: #272727;\n--bdr: #393939;\n--btn: #393939;\n--hbtn: #444;\n--ft: #ccc;\n--cft: #8899a6;\n--dft: #999;\n--bft: #f0f0f0;\n--light: ;\n--dark: 'y';\n--bg: ;\n}\n```\n\nFor choosing another theme, firstly you need to disable the old theme by adding `/*` to the previous line of the code above and `*/` the next line of it. Then enable another theme by removing those two lines there. Save the change to take effect.\n\nIf you don't want the background image, you can change `--bg: ;` to `--bg: 'n';`, if you want to use a different background image (you can use `$ cat IMAGE | base64 -w 0` to get the base64 code), check the section `/* background tiling image */`.\n\nIf you want to create your own palette, check the explanation before `/* Dark Theme: default */`.\n\n## Screenshots:\n\nCheck my previous posts in my blog and ZeroMe: [[ZeroHello]](/Me.ZeroNetwork.bit/?Post/1oranGeS2xsKZ4jVsu9SVttzgkYXu4k9v/1AWwhg4EiWAVttfQboJZ4wJfX3WawfJT3h/1524622391) [[ZeroBlog]](/1EiMAqhd6sMjPG2tznkkGXxhdwFBDdeqT9/?Post:84) [[ZeroMe]](/Me.ZeroNetwork.bit/?Post/1oranGeS2xsKZ4jVsu9SVttzgkYXu4k9v/1AWwhg4EiWAVttfQboJZ4wJfX3WawfJT3h/1524485011)\n\n## Other sources:\n\n[My repo](/13zzNGxEXDeLxHEGZdG3mE7G8dChf45LrV) on Git Center. You can track the update log, submit issue and make request there.\n[Repo on git.gnu.io](https://git.gnu.io/chbinnc/binchan-s-messy-repo/tree/master/Userstyles)\n\nThat's all. Enjoy customizing your own theme and have a fantastic ZeroNet experience ;)\n\n## Edit:\n\nFor Firefox > 57, you can download [this userContent.css](/1EiMAqhd6sMjPG2tznkkGXxhdwFBDdeqT9/shared/userContent.css), copy it to your Firefox profile > `Chrome` folder, then restart your Firefox and profit ;) [[ref]](http://kb.mozillazine.org/UserContent.css) The trick is by adding `!important` to all items, so there may be some bugs with this version. Another bug is, when opening Firefox, Firefox ignores `@media` method (for small screen) and overwrite some other rules outside of it, and only when I change the window width, those `@media` methods work."

While both extensions can be used for the same purpose -- blocking content -- they are different when it comes to scope. Without going into too many details: uMatrix is like the advanced brother of uBlock Origin. It gives you more control, and comes with privacy enhancements on top of that.\n\nYep, uMatrix is a powerful tool for giving user/net-citizen full control of their browser, aka protecting us from all kinds of privacy violation, security traps and also helping us understanding our online activities.\n\n* * *\n\nMy basic uMatrix rules:\n\n```\nhttps-strict: * true\nhttps-strict: behind-the-scene false\nmatrix-off: about-scheme true\nmatrix-off: behind-the-scene true\nmatrix-off: chrome-extension-scheme true\nmatrix-off: chrome-scheme true\nmatrix-off: localhost true\nmatrix-off: opera-scheme true\nreferrer-spoof: behind-the-scene false\nua-spoof: behind-the-scene false\n* * * block\n* * css block\n* * frame block\n* * image allow\n* 1st-party * allow\n* 1st-party css allow\n* 1st-party frame block\n* 1st-party script block\n* cloudflare.com * block\n* cse.google.com css block\n* facebook.com * block\n* fonts.googleapis.com * block\n* www.google.com image block\n* ytimg.com image block\n```\n\nWhy blocking Google, Facebook, Cloudflare? For Facebook, thanks to [the recent scandal](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/03/facebook-abusing-data-law-privacy-big-tech-surveillance), guess I don't need to explain anything. Many small websites use Cloudflare to protect them from DDOS, but they also expose their users to Cloudflare's Javascripts and trackers, if you also need some scandals, here is one: [CloudBleed HTTPS traffic leak](https://github.com/pirate/sites-using-cloudflare). For Google ...\n\nuMatrix [has an awesome real-time logger:](https://github.com/gorhill/uMatrix/wiki/Logger)\n\n![Bildschirmfoto_2018-04-05_11-35-33.png (0x0)](data/img/post_80_Bildschirmfoto_2018-04-05_11-35-33.png)\n\nAs you may discover, I also use [self-destructing cookies addon](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/self-destructing-cookies/). Cookie is a kind of fancy tracking snack as you may already know..\n\nAnd from the screenshot: one image aka the favicon of a site wasn't marked as removed after closing the site. Why? I don't know, maybe it's just a bug from uMatrix, marking as removed doesn't mean they are removed from your computer either. But still, I don't like it, so I opened `about:config`, searched icon and removed some related features, now my browser (Icecat) don't request favicon from any clearnet sites :3 (I don't mind if some sites use it as a fingerprint to track me)\n\nYep, I may be a bit of paranoid for privacy, doing too much things like these is probably not good for mind and health, so..

			"date_published": 1521070525,
			"body": "The size of optional files of my ZeroMe account is reaching 10 MB, and Orange hub has `max_optional_file_size` settings in `./data/users/content.json` (For official hubs only Orange hub and Sun hub have such a setting, other hubs don't, so I guess it's an experiment for Nofish to test `max_optional_file_zite` feature, and Nofish created White hub by cloning another hub, but created Sun hub by cloning Orange hub. And I unfortunately dropped into Orange hub when I registered ZeroMe ;_;), therefore I can't sign and publish my content if I post a large image. I tried to ask Nofish for removing that setting or adding extra permission for my account, by both ZeroMe and ZeroMail, but didn't receive a reply for more than a week.. So I have to deal it by myself.\n\nI cloned a new hub, created a new profile with a different id (0ch.anonymous by 0chan.bit, because a user can't have two same ZeroID in `users.json` iirc, also 0chan.bit is retired in favor of Milchan.bit, so.. :3) and used the script below to copy posts with image to my new account in my own hub:\n\n* * *\n\n```\nold_data = json.load(open('data-old.json'))\nposts_with_image = []\nfor post in old_data['post']:\n    if 'meta' in post and post['meta'] != '{}':\n        posts_with_image.append(copy.copy(post))\n        del(post['meta'])\n        post['body'] += \"\\n\\n--- ---\\n[archived image](?Post/1Mf7JmunnJXvvPospsw85GoZP5ZRxMNKi5/1CC9pMzxP3CEuJLmkK1GBgGMHZdh1Zj9Fv/\" + str(post['post_id']) + \") in my own hub\"\nnew_data = json.load(open('data-new.json'))\nnew_data['post'] += posts_with_image\nnew_data['next_post_id'] += len(posts_with_image)\n\njson.dump(old_data, open('data-old.json','w'), indent=2)\njson.dump(new_data, open('data-new.json','w'), indent=2)\n```\n\nAs you see I didn't remove my old posts, but just removed image items and added a link to the related new post. Good idea, isn't it :D\n\nDoing this kind of thing is a bit ridiculous imho, but I have to. Because the admin/owner of Orange hub is Nofish and you probably know that the whole ZeroNet project, as well as all official zites, are almost developed and maintained by himself/only one person. So I won't complain any thing when some of my voices didn't get caught by his eyes.\n\nEven so, I'd like to think of some better solution for solving the issue I have in this time:\n\nFirstly, I like very much the idea of DAO (Decentralized autonomous organization), for creating an organization without any centralized administration/management (Wikipedia doesn't have a decent definition for it, I don't trust Wikipedia for infomation about this kind of things either, and too lazy to find some good instructions now, so.. sorry that no further info :P). Although ZeroNet itself doesn't have adminstration, a zite has ownership, and the owner can modify all the data of her/his zites, including other users' `data.json`, aka comments, posts, etc. It may sound a little scary, but unfornutately this is how ZeroNet works. A lot better than clearnet if you agree..\n\nAre there some methods to avoid bad things?\n\nYep, [keep backing up your data](?Post:31), as a mistake or zite bug can delete all your content. If you are worried that the zite owner may change your content, you can create a version control or write a bot to keep tracking and conforming that your content on that zite always matches the content of your backup. We can even create a clonable zite for this purpose. By ZeroHello newsfeed, the zite may also provide an alert when content gets changed, but probably it's not worth for developing such a site.. For more secure conversation, a user can use ZeroMail.\n\nAnd some possible solutions?\n\nUsing ZeroMe as example, you may know that your data on ZeroMe are stored in hub zite but not ZeroMe (frontend) zite itself. So just as mentioned before, a user can create and use a hub for himself. But according to the current design of ZeroMe, when you comment on a post of a user from another hub, you actually create a new data.json in that hub and are writing data there. Why design in this way? Because if the comment is stored in your own hub, and if the post owner doesn't add your hub, then s/he won't be able to view your comment >< Also for P2P network, more peers a zite has, faster and safer the zite will be. So can you make sure that your personal hub will have enough peers?\n\nThen what about solution? Well, after ZeroNet becomes more robust and great at anti-spamming, ZeroNet can provide a feature that the privatekey of a (hub) zite is auto-destroyed after it's created (sounds familiar? Yep, smart contract ;) So every user in that hub can 100% own and control their data."

			"body": "I'm interested in adding more command line support for ZeroNet and zites, though I doubt if I will use them very often XD Some hardcore GNU/Linux, BSD devs/hackers will like them I guess. As mentioned in [this post](/Me.ZeroNetwork.bit/?Post/1BLueGvui1GdbtsjcKqCf4F67uKfritG49/16it6qRi6MnCQ9JcqE1WBqNDU14qyXkExX/1471954865) on ZeroMe, if there some APIs (more supports), a dev on GNU/Linux or BSD can even easily do everything with cmdline, with super low system requirement, as no need for a GUI system setup.\n\nCurrently what I have is: [A Shell Script for Manually Signing User Content](?Post:62), and [some bots](?Toc=tag:bot) which can be transformed for cmdline usage. Signing and publishing `content.json` with cmd takes too long time, because `zeronet.py` tries to start a new instance first [Edit 1]. Guess it's possible to add an option for avoiding it, and the process can also be thrown to background, too.\n\nAnd here are some rough ideas:\n\n`$ zerohello list feeds` -> List newsfeeds, with feed_id\n`$ zerohello reply feed:FEED_ID` -> Reply to a post/comment/mention\n`$ zeromail list` -> List new zeromail\n`$ echo \"Hello!\" | zeromail reply binchan2` -> Reply to ZeroMail, or with `cat tmp_reply.md` for long text.\n`$ zerotalk list | grep zeronet` -> List new topics on ZeroTalk with keyword \"zeronet\", topics are all with topic_id.\n`$ zerotalk list topics:binchan2` -> List all topics of a user\n`$ zerotalk show topic:TOPIC_ID` -> Show topic and comments of a topic\n`$ zerotalk follow topic:TOPIC_ID` -> Follow a topic, aka add a topic to ZeroHello Newsfeeds timeline.\n`$ zerotalk comment topic:TOPIC_ID` -> comment to a topic\n`$ zerome create profile` -> create a new profile on ZeroMe (with interactive script)\n`$ zerome show post:POST_ID` -> Show a post (image to ASCII) and its comments\n`$ zerome --interactive` -> Run ZeroMe in interactive mode, with `screen` or `tmux` for multiple windows.\n\nAlso here is [the awesome cli apps list](https://github.com/agarrharr/awesome-cli-apps) on Github, if someone wants to explore some related projects.\n\nEdit 1: here is [zeronet-websocket](/1JKPBG3dLp9FARyarPoR3Mv3p5d9Fy9Em1) for using websocket in cmdline, with it we can sign and publish content, run ZeroFrame API cmd without trying to start a new ZeroNet instance first. Thank Á©∫ÊæÑÁ†ÇÂ§ú (Sorasumi Sayo) for the suggestion and the work!\n\nEdit 2: zeronet-websocket from edit 1 is based on Nodejs, now we also have [Python version](https://github.com/imachug/ZeroNet-cmd-lib) of ZeroFrame API websocket wrapper and cmd examples for ZeroNet, ZeroName, etc. Thank Git Center!\n\nEdit 3: Wow! Now websocket call is directly [supported in official ZeroNet](/Blog.ZeroNetwork.bit/?Post:129:Changelog:+April+4,+2018) \\o/\n\n> Pack a websocket client to allow run any ZeroFrame API call from command line using.

			"body": "Electrum is a lightweight Bitcoin wallet, as you may already know or are using it. Why playing it? Because.. this is the first time I set up a bitcoin wallet X3\n\nYes, I knew Bitcoin in 2013, when I was still a university student, from [the shocking news of Cyprus bailout deal](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/25/cyprus-bailout-deal-eu-closes-bank), a member of EU, had economic (government finance) crisis, because of using euro, couldn't suck every citizen by cash printer and currency inflation like Venezuela recently, directly extracted tax from bank account. At that time some info about Bitcoin was spreading in my social network, and I also joked that using Bitcoin then I wouldn't worry about goverment directly taxing me from my bank account! And a friend joked me back asking if I have a bank account in Cyprus XD However, I didn't pay more attention or set up a bitcoin wallet, and.. you may also know that Bitcoin was considered as the worst investment in 2013 (reported/opined/promoted by some pop media).\n\nI have been on ZeroNet and been tracking Bitcoin price and Bitcoin related news for more than one year, but this is the first time I set up a wallet. Why? I prefer not to share details :3 it's somehow a kind of lifestyle I guess. I can anwser why setting up a Bitcoin wallet now though, because of [this](/Me.ZeroNetwork.bit/?Post/12h51ug6CcntU2aiBjhP8Ns2e5VypbWWtv/1PSaHi14Xh4Kjo3yyjDgbRtj4YLQgWV4QJ/1516567659)~ Why choosing Electrum? Because it's probably the only Bitcoin wallet app in Arch official repo (for Parabola pcr repo there is also `armory`, zeronet is also in that repo, too ;) and it's recommended by ulrichard.\n\nBack to the topic, from the package dependency, Electrum is written in Python and its GUI by qt. First time opening the UI, it asked me to set up a new wallet. There are four options:\n\n* * *\n\n*   Standard wallet\n*   Wallet with two-factor authentication\n*   Multi-signature wallet\n*   Import Bitcoin addresses or private keys\n\n`Wallet with two-factor authentication` needs clearnet and Google service, so pass (I can set up two-factor authentication with my own server I guess). For `Standard wallet`, again there are four options:\n\n*   Create a new seed\n*   I already have a seed\n*   Use public or private keys\n*   Use a hardware device\n\nFor `Create a new seed`, one can choose either `Standard seed` or `Segwit seed`, and the app suggests that Segwit may not be supported by websites and other wallets yet and I might want to keep using a non-segwit wallet. So.. I decided to set up both a standard wallet and a segwit wallet XD\n\nExtra knowledge about Segwit [[src]](https://66shitcoins.com/blog/2018/1/25/how-shitt-is-it-bitcoin-cash-bch):\n\n> BTC's block size has always been 1MB. As transactions need to fit in the upcoming block to be processed sucessfully and with their amount vastly increasing from 2009 until today, the blocks got larger and larger until the maximum capacity of 1MB was reached. Transactions with low fees were rejected by the successfull miner and had to try their luck in the next block. A backlog started to build up, making the network extremely slow and transactions expensive. In 2016, it was clear that BTC desperatly needed a solution for this problem. Besides the group of die-hard-originalists (which did not want any changes to the block size at all), there were two groups left. One in favor of Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 141 (BIP141), the other one opposing it. BIP141 proposed the concept of the so called Segregated Witness, short SegWit, which would have effectively increased the block size to 1.4MB and allowed for almost countless, extremely fast transactions in the network. SegWit's main advantage would have been its existence as a soft-fork.\n\nA seed is generated into 12 random English words, the app suggests \"Please save these 12 words on paper\" and \"Speichern Sie sie nicht elektronish\" (Don't save it in any electronic device). But.. it also provides an option to save it in QR code, and after setting up a wallet, I can view it from Wallet > Seed.. One can encrypt it with a password though, and from the option, I can add an extra text for the seed.\n\nIf I choose `I already have a seed`, I can enter a seed and generate the whole wallet. The wallet is stored in `~/.electrum/wallets`. If I don't set up a password, it's nude:\n\n```\n{\n    \"addr_history\": {\n        \"13qBFgYoM4cNVZfDfE7XB7A8tccNohZ986\": [],\n        \"14scXA1osEEJr6dnWyT4wcdQCTfMvQiNsZ\": [],\n        ...\n    },\n    \"addresses\": {\n        \"change\": [\n            \"17rL7kTzo8Z8MJCEbb4GDeoN16tti3XUnP\",\n            ...\n        ],\n        \"receiving\": [\n            \"1A2ydUUoewYvYNmVXt8K2PCDT7DbRs4Szk\",\n            \"13qBFgYoM4cNVZfDfE7XB7A8tccNohZ986\",\n            ...\n        ]\n    },\n    \"keystore\": {\n        \"seed\": \"eryt joiej ioj ge ioj eoit oij oijoi jeoitjoi joij i4e oij oijoi4 joi4j oij ioje g jioj e4 oir jej\",\n        \"type\": \"bip32\",\n        \"xprv\": \"xprvxxx\",\n        \"xpub\": \"xpubxxx\"\n    },\n    \"pruned_txo\": {},\n    \"seed_type\": \"standard\",\n    \"seed_version\": xx,\n    \"stored_height\": xxx,\n    \"transactions\": {},\n    \"tx_fees\": {},\n    \"txi\": {},\n    \"txo\": {},\n    \"use_encryption\": false,\n    \"verified_tx3\": {},\n    \"wallet_type\": \"standard\",\n    \"winpos-qt\": [\n        xxx,\n        xxx\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nFind something weird? `\"seed\": \"eryt joiej ioj ge ioj eoit oij oijoi jeoitjoi joij i4e oij oijoi4 joi4j oij ioje g jioj e4 oir jej\"` Isn't it 20 English words? and there are actually 21 words @_@ Yep, one can type some random text and get a wallet, but not any text is accepted, it needs to meet some condition, and.. it can be very short! The shortest I found is only about 6 characters. As mentioned above, there is also an option to add extra text to the seed. So, with a 6 character seed and extra text I can just write the seed in my mind X) (the seed inside `~/.electrum/wallets` can be fake, but I always need those private keys to do more things like signing transactions.)\n\nFor `Import Bitcoin addresses or private keys`, one can enter a list of Bitcoin addresses (and public keys for a watching-only wallet). One can import ZeroNet site address, `auth_address`, `auth_privatekey`, `privatekey` in `/path/to/zeronet/data/users.json` there. Using ZeroNet address to store Bitcoin is not secure, because `users.json` is stored in plain text, ZeroNet frequently uses private key to sign a user's own zites/content, and they may be easily leaked by some network attack, from Meltdown/Spectre to recently [pure CSS keylogger](https://github.com/maxchehab/CSS-Keylogging).. Encrypting `users.json` may be a good idea, setting up auto-transaction to a more secure Bitcoin address may be another good idea. Also the wallet is different from a standard wallet, e.g. it doens't have `seed`, `xprv` and`xpub`. Btw, if I enter a private key, I can also find its public key there.\n\nThat's all I guess. Hope Bitcoin can also make me happy. And thank you for reading.\n\nAlso here is an address where you can donate Bitcoin for my work, I can't guarantee they won't get missing or stolen though :3 `1CD6NaHEncn8LriYUj7MDoNqDMWyuigjBX`, or Segwit address: `bc1q444zz8csmsuq958cdk4wp399zngc3ysl4r7f83`."

It's energy friendly because it simply uses linux kernel of Android for chroot and doesn't require any other library or software (like ZeroNet-kivy requires [the bloated and buggy android-kivy](https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet-kivy/issues/20)).\n\n*   That's cool, when will you release the img file?\n\n    I don't know, because.. with my current setting the file is 2 GB, there is probably a way to reduce the size (compress or create it in a more flexible format).\n\n*   Do I really need to root my device?\n\n    Yes for Linuxdeploy, but there are probably some methods that don't require root permisson, like using [Termux](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.termux/) [[ZeroNet-Termux script]](https://github.com/PeterCxy/Termux-ZeroNet), but I can't confirm it.\n    Note 1: [From /r/zeronet/](https://www.reddit.com/r/zeronet/comments/7w8b8w/what_is_so_hard_about_making_a_decent_easytosetup/):\n\n    > I just use Termux.

Expand img size:\n\n    The default image created by Linux deploy is 2 GB, and now ZeroMe is enough to fill the space. When out of space, there is also [a risk of losing data](/Me.ZeroNetwork.bit/?Post/1BLueGvui1GdbtsjcKqCf4F67uKfritG49/16LvuB65gAqLXgy5Pg9UNE6soj6E5huquN/1527134703), and here is my solution:\n\n    Copy linux.img (2 GB) to pc, then create a new linux.img of 3 GB by changing the value in Configure screen in Linux Deploy > hit Install > hit stop when it's finished.\n    Copy new linux.img to pc. Mount both img with `# mount ..`, `# rm -rf /mount/new/*`, `# cp -rp /mount/old/* /mount/new/`, done!"

Because ZeroNet main devs has less communication with Mozilla or the Firefox team? Or the quality of ZeroNet is not good enough?

Here is a tutorial: [Deploy ZeroNet to Heroku as a public proxy service in one click, and host it for free!](https://www.reddit.com/r/zeronet/comments/7gzre8/deploy_zeronet_to_heroku_as_a_public_proxy/) (I haven't tried it because I already host one on my personal VPS, here is [my Nginx setting](?Post:44)), the traffic can soar up if you allow random user to download and upload bigfiles (it can also soar up if you help seeding quite some big files, like my VPS below, this is a problem for Scuttlebutt too, there is <span class=\"col-11 text-gray-dark mr-2\" itemprop=\"about\">a p2p audio publishing and streaming application</span> called [ferment](https://github.com/fermentation/ferment) but currently public pub is offline because of huge bandwidth).\n\n![stats_vps.jpg (0x0)](data/img/post_70_stats_vps.jpg)\n\n*   Copy the files of your zite to another machine at a different place (aka not in the same local network), the file location is `/path/to/zeronet/data/YOUR_ZITE_AUTH_ADDRESS`. Also run ZeroNet server there, then you can directly publish your zite to it and have an initial peer. You can either use `ssh` or ask a friend to help you. We can share zites in this way, but it's not secure (virus, zip bomb, etc)\n\n*   Use VPS to transfer your data to a machine that has an open port:\n\n    `ssh -L 43110:127.0.0.1:43110 -N username@remote` (idea from weakish). So you again need a good VPS from a good provider for it.\n    Here is a more complicated version mentioned [in one of his posts](/me.zeronetwork.bit/?Post/12h51ug6CcntU2aiBjhP8Ns2e5VypbWWtv/1GnJD7CXskmG8GywMbTvbP12wneCFW9XzR/3):\n\n    ```\n    sudo sh -c 'echo GatewayPorts yes' >> /etc/ssh/sshd_config\n\n    sudo service sshd restart # On some OSes, replace `sshd` with `ssh`.\n    ```\n\n    `ssh -2 -N -R 15441:127.0.0.1:15441 -A -D 1080 root@REMOTE_IP tsocks python zeronet.py`\n\nFor helping seeding all optional files of a zite, drag the \"0\" button to the left and check \"Download and help distribute all files\". If you want to contribute more, there are quite some options when starting ZeroNet server:\n`--download_optional {manual,auto}`, `--optional_limit GB or free space %`, `--autodownload_bigfile_size_limit MB`.\n\nCheck `python2 zeronet.py --help` for details.\n\nAnother thing worth mentioning is that after you successfully published your zite, actually you only successfully published `content.json` but not all files. And because all kinds of network problem, some files may fail to publish. You can use another machine (a different ZeroNet instance in your computer is also ok, EDIT: since v 0.6.2 local peer discovering is activated by default, you need to turn off your main ZeroNet intance first) to help check if all files are successfully published.\n\nThat's all I guess. Hope it's helpful :)\n\n#### Edit 1:\n\n> As far as i understand it, in tor-only mode port doesn't matter/is closed. Anyway, i'm able to publish zites to some other users\n\nThank caryoscelus for this info"

I have uploaded about 1.7 GB music there (I won't tell you where they are and you can try to find them by yourself :3). And here is how:\n\n## Prerequisite:\n\n*   Your songs (album) have proper ID3 tags, if not, you can use `EasyTAG` to create them efficiently, or you need to change the code a bit.\n\n*   `pip install pytaglib Unidecode --user`\n\nI use Jupyter Notebook so that I can easily test each block of code, if you want a single script, you can try to glue them by yourself :3\n\n* * *\n\nImport necessary libs:\n\n```\nimport json, os, time, subprocess\nimport taglib\nfrom unidecode import unidecode\n```\n\nList album folders:\n\n```\nmusic_dir = ''  # <- Your main music directory\nfor i in range(len(sorted(os.listdir(music_dir)))):\n    print(str(i)+': '+sorted(os.listdir(music_dir))[i])\n```\n\nChoose an album:\n\n```\nsong_dir = music_dir + sorted(os.listdir(music_dir))[0]  # <- change the number\nprint(sorted(os.listdir(song_dir)))\nsong_list = sorted(os.listdir(song_dir))\n```\n\nTest ID3 tags:\n\n```\naudiofile = taglib.File(song_dir + '/' + song_list[0])\nprint(audiofile.tags['ALBUM'])\nprint(audiofile.tags['ARTIST'])\nprint(audiofile.tags['TRACKNUMBER'])\nprint(audiofile.tags['TITLE'])\n```\n\nMain:\n\n```\ndate_json_dir = ''  # <- Your data.json directory, in Genre zite -> data/users/YOUR_AUTH_ID/, you need to upload a file first to create it. Also you'd better backup it first.\ndata_json = json.load(open('data.json'))\nfor song in song_list:\n    if song[-3:] == 'mp3' or song[-4:] == 'flac':  # only mp3 and flac are tested\n        print(song)\n        audiofile = taglib.File(song_dir + '/' + song)\n        track_num = str(audiofile.tags['TRACKNUMBER'][0])\n        if len(track_num) == 1:\n            track_num = '0' + track_num\n        album = audiofile.tags['ALBUM'][0]\n        artist = audiofile.tags['ARTIST'][0]\n        new_time = int(time.time()*1000)\n        data_json['songs'][str(new_time)] = {\n            'album': album,\n            'artist': artist,\n            'date_added': new_time,\n            'filename': unidecode(song).replace('!',''),  # \"!\" is not supported in optional file name\n            'title': track_num + ' - ' + audiofile.tags['TITLE'][0]\n        }\n        time.sleep(1)  # ZeroLSTN uses timestamp as id, so sleep one second to create a different id\nprint(data_json['songs'])   # Check if the data.json is correct\n```\n\nWrite the new data to `data.json`:\n\n```\njson.dump(data_json, open('data.json', \"w\"), indent=2)\n```\n\nCopy music files and rename them with valid ASCII filename:\n\n```\nfor song in song_list:\n    if not os.path.isdir('output'):\n        os.mkdir('output')\n    if song[-3:] == 'mp3' or song[-4:] == 'flac':\n        subprocess.Popen('cp \\\"'+song_dir+'/'+song+'\\\" '+'\\'output/'+unidecode(song).replace('!','') +'\\'', shell=True).stdout\n```\n\nThen copy files to your `data/users/AUTH_KEY` folder, or you can change `output` folder above to it directly. Finally manually [sign and publish](?Post:62) your `data.json`, if `.piecemap.msgpack` file is generated for each file, or your uploaded music appears on ZeroLSTN and has at least 1 seeder (and playable obviously), then it's successful. That's all!\n\n## Troubleshootings/Tips:\n\n*   One of my albums in flac format was uploaded successfully, but when I clicked the songs, they couldn't be loaded. Converting them to mp3 solved the problem (I use QMMP).\n*   Where can I find free music?\n    Well, some albums I uploaded are bought from [Bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com/), many bands there set the price of their albums to 0$, so supporting them or not depending on yourself and your pocket ;) [Jamando](https://www.jamendo.com/) is a great place for legal free music, Archive.org is another wonderful place, someone also [mirrors/archives Jamendo albums](https://archive.org/details/jamendo-albums) there. The ultra music pirate paradise is Youtube -> `youtube-dl`, if you agree...\n\n*   Without a high quality device and earphone (Sennheiser? I didn't have chance to try one /_| The best I have is from Superlux, [Dolby effect](http://forum.xda-developers.com/android/apps-games/mod-dolby-atmos-t3109446) for Kindle Fire HDX is also very amazing for some music btw), and enough time/quiet environment to enjoy music, high quality music is meaningless.\n\nChester Bennington is dead, who cares about the music industry! Get up in this morning and Dolores O'Riordan is dead, who cares about the music industry! Chris Martin is still alive and getting more popular in these years... well, long live the king/those stars. Viva la vida!"

After you schedule the bot and follow it, you can receive new ZeroMail notification from ZeroHello newsfeed.\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n*   [How to install](#how-to-install-)\n*   [Screenshot](#screenshot-)\n*   [FAQ](#faq-)\n*   [Credits](#credits-)\n*   [Similar Projects](#links-)\n\n* * *\n\n## How to install:\n\n1.  Open [ZeroMail bot zite](/16WKzsiU8QrYo2AghXEpMT6LaMQVofLmqC), then from ZeroHello [[FAQ 1]](#faq-), choose `3-dot menu` after the zite \"Local ZeroMail Bot\" and clone it. Again from ZeroHello choose the menu after your new \"myLocal ZeroMail Bot\" and check \"Pause\" (Because it's for local use ;) (If you can't open the zite, you can download it [here](/1EiMAqhd6sMjPG2tznkkGXxhdwFBDdeqT9/shared/ZeroMail_bot_zite.zip) and unzip it to `/path/to/zeronet/data/`, you may need to restart ZeroNet server to open it).\n2.  On your new bot zite select an id you like and send a message, so your id folder is generated in your zite. Also hit the \"Follow\" button.\n3.  Download [ZeroMailBot.zip](/1EiMAqhd6sMjPG2tznkkGXxhdwFBDdeqT9/shared/ZeroMailBot.zip) from my blog, then unzip it to the root folder of your ZeroNet instance. Or clone and copy it from [my messy repo](/13zzNGxEXDeLxHEGZdG3mE7G8dChf45LrV/).\n4.  Finally start the bot with `$ python2 zeromail_bot.py`, follow the instruction and done! You can schedule the bot with `cron`, `systemd`, or with a simple command like `$ while sleep TIME_INTERVAL_IN_SECOND; do python2 zeromail_bot.py; done`.\n\n## Screenshot:\n\n* * *\n\n![mailbot2.png (0x0)](data/img/post_67_mailbot2.png)\n\n## FAQ:\n\n1.  Is it possible that my zeromails leak to the public?\n\n    It should be impossible, because I also tweaked `cert_signers` in `data/users/content.json` to `\"zeroid.nobit\": [\"2iD5ZQJMNXu43w1qLB8sfdHVKppVMduGz\"]`, so your content will never be published.\n\n    But it's possible that my private key to the ZeroMail bot zite got leaked and the hacker changed the settings of my bot zite, so for security you may prefer check the code and download the zite from [my messy repo](/13zzNGxEXDeLxHEGZdG3mE7G8dChf45LrV/) [[clearnet alternative on git.gnu.io]](https://git.gnu.io/chbinnc/binchan-s-messy-repo/).\n\n    If you want more security, like not saving your ZeroMail in plaintext, you can change these lines in `zeromail_bot.py`, and ZeroMailBot won't store (and display) your ZeroMail content:\n\n    ```diff\n            output_data['message'] += [{\n    -                    'body': message['body'],\n    +                    'body': '',\n    -                    'send_from': message['from'],\n    +                    'send_from': '',\n                        'send_to': message['to'],\n    -                    'subject': message['subject'],\n    +                    'subject': '',\n                        'date_sent': message['date_sent'],\n                        'date_added': int(time.time()*1000)\n                        }]\n    ```\n\n    ZeroMailBot also stores your contact list and last update info of received mails in plaintext for performance reason. You can also remove them by:\n\n    ```diff\n    secrets = []\n\n    if not os.path.isfile('ZeroMailBot/last_update_info.json'):\n        last_update_info = {}\n    - else:\n    -     last_update_info = json.load(open('ZeroMailBot/last_update_info.json'))\n    ...\n    - json.dump(last_update_info, open('ZeroMailBot/last_update_info.json', \"w\"), indent=2)\n    return decrypted_data\n    ```\n\n2.  Can I send zeromail from the bot? If not, why did you bother creating a UI for it?\n\n    No. Well.. because of personal interest. Also in some machine (like my Raspberry Pi 2), it can be very slow to open ZeroMail. So.. before your ZeroMail is initiated, you can read the mail on the bot zite.\n\n## Credits:\n\n*   Thank gitcenter for extracting the essential functions to `cryptlib.py` and many other things!\n*   Thank bornfree for [the idea](/Talk.ZeroNetwork.bit/?Topic:1514602755_1GNuATGPPFyvKngtWmbDrpo2D7u2rGM36m/How+to+extract+ZeroMail+messages+directly) and some related code!\n\n## Links:\n\n*   [ZeroMailProxy](https://github.com/imachug/ZeroMailProxy) - SMTP/POP3 protocol for ZeroMail by gitcenter.\n*   [ZeroMail to Email Client Transport](/1LnrtiTmBqYKrhorBxHsuiQLw8bKqjz5k7) maintained by bornfree\n    Localhost POP3 + SMTP server which will eventually allow your favorite e-mail client to send/recieve messages over ZeroMail.

			"date_published": 1515240636.7,
			"body": "Continue my ~~[absurd](https://github.com/krasimir/absurd)~~ astonishing Javascript coding trip. In this time it is an informative essay for a trivial problem!\n\nYou may know that if an html element has an id, you can add that id to the url to jump to the position of that element. And such url/link is called anchor.\n\nBut on ZeroNet a zite is inside an iframe sandbox, it can't access to the resources outside the iframe, and it seems anchor doesn't work with usual code. So ZeroNet `uimedia.js` provides two functions:\nOne is `onhashchange`\n\n```\n      window.onhashchange = (function(_this) {\n        return function(e) {\n          var src;\n          _this.log(\"Hashchange\", window.location.hash);\n          if (window.location.hash) {\n            src = $(\"#inner-iframe\").attr(\"src\").replace(/#.*/, \"\") + window.location.hash;\n            return $(\"#inner-iframe\").attr(\"src\", src);\n          }\n        };\n      })(this);\n```\n\nWith it when you click an anchor inside the page (like [TOC](?Post:60)), you can jump to the related portion.\n\n* * *\n\nThe other one is for responding to an API command called `wrapperInnerLoaded`\n\n> Applies the windows.location.hash to page url. Call when you page is fully loaded to jump to the desired anchor point.\n\n(I'm not an English native speaker actually, so... I've no obstable to understand what the explanation above means, if not accurately XD)\n\n```\n      ...\n      } else if (cmd === \"innerLoaded\" || cmd === \"wrapperInnerLoaded\") {\n        if (window.location.hash) {\n          $(\"#inner-iframe\")[0].src += window.location.hash;\n          return this.log(\"Added hash to location\", $(\"#inner-iframe\")[0].src);\n        }\n      ...\n```\n\nIf you don't add this command, when you copy the anchor link of your zite and open it in a new page, it doesn't work. Then it will be painful when you want to point a specific portion of a page to others.\n\nZeroBlog uses this command, and in the code above a message is pushed to the log. Thanks to that I can figure out what happened.\n\nAnd I **successfully** add it to ZeroChat (actually a local ZeroMail bot I'm working on), now my code looks like this:\n\n```\n    addMessage (message) {\n        if (typeof message === 'object') {\n          var date = formatDate(message[\"date_sent\"])\n          this.messages.innerHTML += \"<div class='message'>\" + \n            \"<h3 class='title' id='\" + String(message[\"date_sent\"]) + \"'>\" + message[\"subject\"] + \"</h3>\" + \n            \"<p>\" + \"<b>From</b>: \" + message[\"send_from\"] + \n            \"<br><b>To</b>: \" + message[\"send_to\"] + \n            \"<br><b>Date</b>: \" + date + \"</p>\" + \n            marked(message[\"body\"]) + \"</div>\"\n          if (this.messages.childElementCount == 1) {\n            this.cmd(\"innerLoaded\", true)\n          }\n        } else {\n          this.messages.innerHTML += \"<div class='message'>\" + marked(message) + \"</div>\"\n        }\n    }\n```\n\nThe most important thing is: that is the only position I've found to make it work... Exactly after inserting the message html code, and it looks like it has nothing to do with whether the related message has been pushed (You won't know how hard I've tried to go this far ;_;). And I again need another `if` to avoid such a disaster:\n\n```\n[Wrapper] Added hash to location \"http://127.0.0.1:43110/1FxdhGzEh4URDfXJH4uFwJwNQcPcNJutpQ/?wrapper_nonce=957842b7d70f31c6908d98ac50ddda9862f0313a7f574a7e9b2e60d31043c702#1482053116596\"  all.js:1546:14\n[Wrapper] Added hash to location \"http://127.0.0.1:43110/1FxdhGzEh4URDfXJH4uFwJwNQcPcNJutpQ/?wrapper_nonce=957842b7d70f31c6908d98ac50ddda9862f0313a7f574a7e9b2e60d31043c702#1482053116596#1482053116596\"  all.js:1546:14\n[Wrapper] Added hash to location \"http://127.0.0.1:43110/1FxdhGzEh4URDfXJH4uFwJwNQcPcNJutpQ/?wrapper_nonce=957842b7d70f31c6908d98ac50ddda9862f0313a7f574a7e9b2e60d31043c702#1482053116596#1482053116596#1482053116596\"  all.js:1546:14\n...\n```\n\nI think I will stop trying to add more features (like route for every post) to my small project in this way, this is probably not a good approach..."

Although I know it from some ZeroNet posts for quite some time, I haven't tried it until recently.\n\nThe installation progress was quite smooth by following [the official Getting Started](https://www.scuttlebutt.nz/getting-started.html), the linux app is packed by using AppImage, after `chmod a+x` I only need a simple click to open it, quite fancy. The UI is nice and officially supports dark theme ^^\n\n![Bildschirmfoto_2017-12-31_10-44-26.png (0x0)](data/img/post_63_Bildschirmfoto_2017-12-31_10-44-26.png)\n\n* * *\n\nWhen adding [Pub Servers](https://github.com/ssbc/scuttlebot/wiki/Pub-Servers), I followed the suggestion **\"Please don't just choose the first pub in the list!\"** and scanned the list to find one that I prefer to join. I chose the last one under \"pubs with reusable invite codes\", but failed and returned `could not connect to sbot`. I did a simple search with Searx but the discussion I found were more about development but not normal use. I could access [https://ssb.nz](https://ssb.nz) and there is a cool Gundam photo there! I tried adding other pubs, and.. only the first one worked for me XD I also tried one from \"Pubs that give out invite codes\", same with `could not connect to sbot`.\n\nAfter I successfully added the pub, a lot data began to sync, like BitMessage, I only followed two users there and now the data folder is about 420MB O_O but the benefit is that I can immediately access a lot of posts there. Just hope it won't quickly eat up my limited SSD space (only about 15GB left, I attach another 500GB HDD by the DVD drive slot and have another 1TB drive that is still waiting for eating data though :3).\n\nAttachment limit is 5MB, so probably most users only upload photos but not videos or other big files. The photo preview is shown in the post but I need to view the fullsize one by opening it in a browser. I downloaded it and checked the sha256sum, it is the same with the orginal one. So the meta data of my uploaded photos are inside. Wonder if someone will be amazed that some beautiful photos were taken by Blackberry Bold 9700 :3\n\nIn opposite to ZeroMe, everything is changeable, posting on Patchwork:\n\n> There is no edit. There is no Undo. There is no delete. So, use your spellcheck, actually look at the Preview, and don't publish mad. You won't be able to take it back.\n\nLike blockchain I guess. Markdown support is everywhere and after I hit the `Publish` button, there was a preview window as mentioned above (must have feature I think) and I could decide whether confirming it or polishing my post further.\n\n![Bildschirmfoto_2017-12-31_11-12-58.png (0x0)](data/img/post_63_Bildschirmfoto_2017-12-31_11-12-58.png)\n\nEverything works as expected and there are some friendly features inside, like searching, channels, friend recommendations. There is also a ZeroNet channel there!\n\n![Bildschirmfoto_2017-12-31_01-10-08.png (0x0)](data/img/post_63_Bildschirmfoto_2017-12-31_01-10-08.png)\n\nJust a few posts there though, half of a day later I received 2 likes and 1 comment, and ;D\n\n![Bildschirmfoto_2017-12-31_11-21-55.png (0x0)](data/img/post_63_Bildschirmfoto_2017-12-31_11-21-55.png)\n\nThank @ks!\n\nThe data stream there is quite transparent, e.g in the channel page, it shows who has subcribed to a channel, and.. it also shows who has left the channel O_O (such design can have some benefit though). Also it has private chat and user blocking feature:\n\n> Stay Happy and Safe\n> \n> Don't worry, if come across someone whose views make you uncomfortable. You can always block them, and you'll never receive any of their posts again, and they won't get yours either.\n\nThat is all I guess. Quite a nice social network and I have added a shortcut for it on the desktop. Hope I also have a wonderful journey there like what I had and am still having on ZeroNet and Diaspora*.\n\nThanks for reading :)"

Then create a sh file like `signContent.sh` under your ZeroNet root folder, and change `your_zeronet_path`, `your_id_auth_address` and `your_private_key` (you can find them in `/path/to/zeronet/data/user.json`). Finally `$ chmod 755 signContent.sh`.\n\nRun it with `$ ./signContent.sh zite_address`. Manually editing your `data.json` can be dangerous, so [keep backing up your data](/1EiMAqhd6sMjPG2tznkkGXxhdwFBDdeqT9/?Post:31) ;)\n\nBtw, you can add `alias signContent='/path/to/zeronet/signContent.sh'` to `~/.bashrc`, then `$ source ~/.bashrc`, and use it as a normal command `$ signContent zite_address`."

			"body": "Guess you know [ZeroWiki](/138R53t3ZW7KDfSfxVpWUsMXgwUnsDNXLP), it's the most popular zite under \"Guide\" tab on ZeroSites (submitted by me :3). One of its important issue is that it doesn't have history diff feature, so when someone changed the content, you can't easily check what has been changed.\n\nRecently affeali created diff feature for it, [the source code](/1BeUcctgazL9DkHgPD8zFpCNggqjEEfjRu) is also available on Git Center, but like what [her/his profile](/Me.ZeroNetwork.bit/?Profile/12h51ug6CcntU2aiBjhP8Ns2e5VypbWWtv/1HFZzR6sZhBvjpmdXoA1msaVTsPwceD9JB/affeali@zeroid.bit) say: \"developer with too many projects so none of them are ready\". So I guess it's still experimental and won't merge to the main ZeroWiki soon.\n\nBut... I find a working solution to add the feature to it :3 Here is how:\n`cd /path/to/zeronet/data/`, then\ncopy `1BeUcctgazL9DkHgPD8zFpCNggqjEEfjRu/js/libs` to `138R53t3ZW7KDfSfxVpWUsMXgwUnsDNXLP/js/`.\nCopy and rename\n`1BeUcctgazL9DkHgPD8zFpCNggqjEEfjRu/js/all.js`, `1BeUcctgazL9DkHgPD8zFpCNggqjEEfjRu/css/all.css`,\n`1BeUcctgazL9DkHgPD8zFpCNggqjEEfjRu/index.html`\nto\n`138R53t3ZW7KDfSfxVpWUsMXgwUnsDNXLP/js/all2.js`, `138R53t3ZW7KDfSfxVpWUsMXgwUnsDNXLP/css/all2.css`,\n`138R53t3ZW7KDfSfxVpWUsMXgwUnsDNXLP/index2.html`.\nOpen `138R53t3ZW7KDfSfxVpWUsMXgwUnsDNXLP/index2.html` and change the line below:\n\n```diff\n...\n- <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"css/all.css\" type=\"text/css\" media=\"screen\">\n+ <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"css/all2.css\" type=\"text/css\" media=\"screen\">\n...\n- <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"js/all.js\" async></script>\n+ <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"js/all2.js\" async></script>\n...\n```\n\nThat's all! You even don't need to sign and publish the zite (you can't either XD). Then visit ZeroWiki with [http://127.0.0.1:431110/138R53t3ZW7KDfSfxVpWUsMXgwUnsDNXLP/index2.html](/138R53t3ZW7KDfSfxVpWUsMXgwUnsDNXLP/index2.html).\n\n* * *\n\nScreenshot from [List of resources for ZeroNet and Zite development](/138R53t3ZW7KDfSfxVpWUsMXgwUnsDNXLP/?Page:devresources):\n\n![Bildschirmfoto_2017-12-12_09-21-59.png (0x0)](data/img/post_61_Bildschirmfoto_2017-12-12_09-21-59.png)\n\nBtw, you can manually add commands and subscribe feeds of new changes of specific ZeroWiki page to ZeroHello (That's awesome, isn't it ;D):\nShutdown ZeroNet server first, add this to `/path/to/zeronet/data/users.json` ( be aware of the comma at the end of every item except the last one, you'd better **backup** your `users.json` before directly edit it):\n\n```diff\n  \"138R53t3ZW7KDfSfxVpWUsMXgwUnsDNXLP\": {\n    \"auth_address\": ...,\n    \"auth_privatekey\": ...,\n+    \"follow\": {\n+      \"New Change From ZeroWiki\": [\n+            \"SELECT 'notif' AS type, 'New Channge From Page ' || slug AS title, 'index2.html?Page' || slug || '&History' AS url, date_added, '' AS body FROM pages WHERE slug IN (:params)\", \n+            [\n+              \"faq\",\n+              \"dev-ideas\",\n+              \"devresources\"\n+            ]\n+      ]\n+    },\n    \"cert\": \"zeroid.bit\"\n  },\n```\n\nFinally restart ZeroNet. That's all! More info in my previous post: [Some Experiments about ZeroHello Feed](/1EiMAqhd6sMjPG2tznkkGXxhdwFBDdeqT9/?Post:46).\n\nAlso I tried to change the follow code to display username like:\n\n![Bildschirmfoto_2017-12-13_14-59-37.png (0x0)](data/img/post_61_Bildschirmfoto_2017-12-13_14-59-37.png)\n\n```diff\n-            \"SELECT 'notif' AS type, 'New Channge From Page ' || slug AS title, 'index2.html?Page' || slug || '&History' AS url, date_added, '' AS body FROM pages WHERE slug IN (:params)\", \n+            \"SELECT 'notif' AS type, 'From Page ' || slug AS title, 'index2.html?Page' || slug || '&History' AS url, date_added, 'New change by ' || replace(value, '@zeroid.bit', '') AS body FROM pages LEFT JOIN keyvalue ON (pages.json_id = keyvalue.json_id + 1) WHERE slug IN (:params)\",\n```\n\nFind sth weird in the code? `pages.json_id = keyvalue.json_id + 1`. Yep, json_id of pages and keyvalue is mismatched, it's even more awful when I still didn't reload and rebuild the database of ZeroWiki: no feed from ZeroWiki and there are many `body is null` errors in console for ZeroHello. I don't know the cause, so it's not recommended to add this feature."

So I didn't paid more attention.\n\nUntil recently, I stumbled upon sth (I won't tell you what it is as such info is (only) useful for advert :P), and I decided to buy one, even though I still couldn't find a good reason. And I bought a second-hand one.\n\nAfter bought the watch, like a kid with a new toy, I took quite some time searching related infos and learn how to tweak it, so I can make the best use of it. First of all I was surprised that one year ago Pebble officially announced that the company would be shut down and no longer produced new watches. What happened to such a successful and awesome company!? What I found is: [due to various factors](https://blog.getpebble.com/2016/12/07/fitbit/), and ~~no more X(~~ you can check [Edit 1](/1EiMAqhd6sMjPG2tznkkGXxhdwFBDdeqT9/?Post:57#edit-1-) for the related story.\n\n## CONTENTS\n\n*   [Hardware](/1EiMAqhd6sMjPG2tznkkGXxhdwFBDdeqT9/?Post:57#hardware)\n*   [Software](/1EiMAqhd6sMjPG2tznkkGXxhdwFBDdeqT9/?Post:57#software) - [Watchfaces](/1EiMAqhd6sMjPG2tznkkGXxhdwFBDdeqT9/?Post:57#watchfaces), [Watchapps](/1EiMAqhd6sMjPG2tznkkGXxhdwFBDdeqT9/?Post:57#watchapps), [Games](/1EiMAqhd6sMjPG2tznkkGXxhdwFBDdeqT9/?Post:57#games)\n*   [Conclusion](/1EiMAqhd6sMjPG2tznkkGXxhdwFBDdeqT9/?Post:57#conclusion)\n*   [Edit 1](/1EiMAqhd6sMjPG2tznkkGXxhdwFBDdeqT9/?Post:57#edit-1-), [Edit 2](/1EiMAqhd6sMjPG2tznkkGXxhdwFBDdeqT9/?Post:57#edit-2-)\n\n* * *\n\n## Hardware\n\nBefore I knew that Pebble time introduced an e-paper screen. I thought it was using e-ink technique, but turned out it's not, it's still LED, but always-on. Here is [a good explanation](https://www.reddit.com/r/pebble/comments/3i6mje/epaper_tech_of_the_pebble_time_explained/) I found:\n\n> In the case of the Pebble, the technology used is low-power memory LCD. The screen saves power by saving the display state in the pixels themselves, which saves you the costly refresh you'd otherwise have to perform 30 or 60 times per second.\n> In conclusion: The screen on the pebble ALWAYS uses power, unless it is shut off. It uses considerably more power, however, when the content is changed.\n\nWith such a screen the smartwatch can last for one week, impressive. The charging cable is also quite unique: the cable magnetically attaches itself to the back of the watch. As the battery of Pebble Time is 150 mAh, the watch needs less than 1 hour to be fully charged through laptop usb port, and lasts for one week...\n\nThe cable or the charging slot also has the potential to transfer data, the related accessaries are called smartstrap. One smartstrap is [TYLT V√ú Pulse](http://www.pebblestuff.io/accs/tylt-vu-pulse-pebble-time-pebble-time-steel/) . As Pebble Time has no heart rate sensor, TYLT V√ú Pulse is for filling this void and it's a successful crowdfunding campaign.\n\nFor more info about the hardware of Pebble, you can check [the awesome step by step teardown introduction](https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/Pebble+Time+Teardown/42382) on iFixit.\n\n## Software\n\nPebble can connect to smartphone by Bluebooth, and I connect it with my Yotaphone 2\\. Surely I can use the official app, but there is a better replacement: [Gadgetbridge](https://github.com/Freeyourgadget/Gadgetbridge), opensource and does not require internet access permission (!). Why not ;)\n\nPebble app store is likely going to shut down in this year [[ref]](https://www.wareable.com/apps/the-best-apps-for-pebble-and-pebble-steel), there is [a third-party replacement project](https://github.com/pebble-dev/rebble-store) on Github, but it's still not online. Therefore, I have only (and luckily I have) around one month left to discover and download apps from the store.\nI have already downloaded more than 50 apps there :3\n\nThere are 3 types of app:\n\n### Watchfaces\n\nThe first one is [watchface](https://github.com/Freeyourgadget/Gadgetbridge/wiki/Pebble-Watchfaces). It's the default home of the always-on screen of Pebble and can display any info a user likes, by watchface devs, obviously.\nThe one I choose is [Healthify](https://github.com/prakashait09/Healthify), opensource and elegant. It has three tabs and I can change the tab by shaking the watch, really interesting design and practical.\n![sc1.png (0x0)](data/img/post_57_sc1.png)\nFor many watchfaces it's necessary to access dev's website to configure the UI, by parsing some special json string. Many devs use it to promote themselves and... do SCIENCE ><\n\nLike from [TimeStyle config website](https://freakified.github.io/TimeStylePebble/config_color.html):\n\n> ./TimeStyle Settings_files/config.js:613: // Send the config data to the tracking service for SCIENCE\n\nFor Healthify, the setting UI is inside the app, and I can directly access it offline by my phone.\n\n[TimeStyle](https://github.com/freakified/TimeStylePebble) is another watchface I like, simple but still very customizable. However, as mentioned above, the watchface needs internet access to config the UI and... but It's just a website reading user's selections and outputing some json text, there is no need for backend service. So I just downloaded the website and related CDN files, removed the evil SCIENCE related code and copied the files to my phone (once I did quite some science (experiments) with white mice in the lab. Science is good, but I never think of becoming others' white mouse, expecially in an unconscious condition). Yep, now I can configure the UI offline X)\n\nAnother funny opensource watchface is [Mario](https://github.com/ClusterM/pebble-mario), it's famous in the Pebble store and recommended by Gadgetbridge team.\n\nMany watchfaces can display weather info. Some are really with nice design, like:\n[Emotisun](https://apps.getpebble.com/en_US/application/57d827e412cf10a30200002b?section=watchfaces&dev_settings=true)\n\n![sc2.png (0x0)](data/img/post_57_sc2.png)\n[MAKE ME SMILE](https://apps.getpebble.com/en_US/application/559f0fffe2b45a3231000098?section=watchfaces)\n\n![gif-1.0.gif (0x0)](data/img/post_57_gif-1.0.gif)\nGadgetbridge has no Internet access permission, so they are useless for me. Still Gadgetbridge provides [a workaround](https://github.com/Freeyourgadget/Gadgetbridge/issues/482) to display weather on some watchfaces. For me it works with TimeStyle, but not for Healthify. Actually I don't need weather, so I will ignore it.\n\n### Watchapps\n\nThe second type is watchapp, there are really many apps there, totally a different world compare to smartphone. Official catalog includes daily, notifications, health & fitness, tools & utilities, remotes and games.\nFor health, the official app and Gadgetbridge are enough for me. I can track and analyze my daily activity and sleep, quite fancy.\n![sc3.png (0x0)](data/img/post_57_sc3.png)\n\nSome apps I've installed and that are worth to mention include:\n![sc5.png (0x0)](data/img/post_57_sc5.png)\n\n*   [Breathe](https://github.com/cheeseisdisgusting/exhale/) is an opensource, amazing app for helping and reminding a person to relax, and for dealing with intensive and stressful daily life.\n*   \"Get Up, Stand Up\" is another app that has similar purpose: Doing desktop work? Do you know that sitting for too long time can be very harmful to your health? Yep, this app is for reminding you to stand up and move your body when you've been sat down too long. Maybe a god sent gift for many devs ;)\n\n*   Steps: useful for jogging.\n\n*   Compass: official compass app in the store.\n\nPebble doesn't have touch screen, but instead using four buttons to controll everything. Each button can be set for quickly accessing an app, Currently I set one for Breathe, one for \"Get Up, Stand Up\", though I doubt if I'll use them a lot XD\n\n### Games\n\nThe third type of app is game. Yep, you can play games in this 1.25-inch, 64-color screen, and there are quite some games there. But like [weakish said on ZeroMe](/Me.ZeroNetwork.bit/?Profile/12h51ug6CcntU2aiBjhP8Ns2e5VypbWWtv/1GnJD7CXskmG8GywMbTvbP12wneCFW9XzR/weakish@zeroid.bit)\n\n> ... I do not read/browse/view a lot with the mobile phone, since either neck or shoulders are in an unnatural angle.\n\nDoing game on Pebble can become more horrible to one's neck. In my opinion Pebble or smartwatch is more suitable for reminder, tracker and instantly glancing some short infos. So I prefer not to use it play (addictive...) games.\nStill there are some games worth to mention:\n\n![sc6.png (0x0)](data/img/post_57_sc6.png)\n\n*   [Tiny Life](https://github.com/theoreticalb/pebble_life): as doing research on artificial life is one of my ambition, so I'll keep this one.\n\n*   [Maze](https://github.com/Zerthick/PebbleMaze): classic paper game! The game is just 9 kb but still featured with uniquely procedurally generated maze for each game.\n\n*   [Hachi](http://hatchiapp.com/): Anyone ever played this!? A retro virtual pet! But I won't play it if I need to send my daily activity to someone's server.\n\n*   Flyby: animated random terrain generator with time using diamond square algorithm. What interests me is the algorithm.\n\n*   Pokedex Challenge:\n\n    > ‚Ä¢ Pokemon will appear at random times throughout the day\n    > ‚Ä¢ You can only catch one Pokemon at a time\n    > ‚Ä¢ If multiple Pokemon pop up at once, or if it's been a while since you've seen one (>12 hours), you can re-populate them by opening the app from the menu\n\n    Hmm...\n    There is no source link for this game, but still it's based on [an opensource project](https://github.com/DKote/Pebble-Dex).\n\n## Conclusion\n\nPebble Time is really a fancy smartwatch, but I still can't tell how much it will mean to me. Maybe I will wear it for several weeks and get tired of having sth on my wrist all the time, then re-sell it to others or let it eat dusk in my shelf forever as a souvenir. Maybe it will die after several months of use since it's second-hand and no official warranty any more, as Pebble company is already a history. Maybe it's really useful for my daily life and I will buy a new one even after it's dead. Time will tell.\n\nThanks for reading and hope you like it :)\n\n### Edit 1:\n\n[The Inside Story Behind Pebble‚Äôs Demise](https://www.wired.com/2016/12/the-inside-story-behind-pebbles-demise/#.krc67o695)\n\n> Any regrets?\n> \n> ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt change that much,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúIt didn‚Äôt go perfectly to plan, but things rarely do. We gave it a shot. We built a great product, we shipped it, we started a market‚Ä¶and we weren‚Äôt able to get to the next step.‚Äù\n> ...\n> Despite its abrupt ending, Pebble was an innovative and expansive company that delivered value to its users and an appreciative community for developers. It was a breath of fresh air in a space where big companies compete with grim and sometimes misguided determination.\n\n### Edit 2:\n\nFrom [List of highest funded crowdfunding projects on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest_funded_crowdfunding_projects), Pebble Time ranks No.17... and except Star Citizen (No.4), others are (all) from Ethereum. You can check the list for detail."

			"date_published": 1510963249.2,
			"body": "If you try uploading an image to ZeroMe in Torbrowser, you will find that you just submitted a blank white one.\nHere is the explanation from [Tor Project design docs (under 4.6, section 2\\. HTML5 Canvas Image Extraction)](https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser/design/#fingerprinting-linkability) [[Thx to the answer on StackExchange]](https://tor.stackexchange.com/questions/3283/html5-canvas-security-flaw)\n\n> After plugins and plugin-provided information, we believe that the HTML5 Canvas is the single largest fingerprinting threat browsers face today. Initial studies show that the Canvas can provide an easy-access fingerprinting target: The adversary simply renders WebGL, font, and named color data to a Canvas element, extracts the image buffer, and computes a hash of that image data. Subtle differences in the video card, font packs, and even font and graphics library versions allow the adversary to produce a stable, simple, high-entropy fingerprint of a computer. In fact, the hash of the rendered image can be used almost identically to a tracking cookie by the web server.\n> \n> To reduce the threat from this vector, we have patched Firefox to prompt before returning valid image data to the Canvas APIs. If the user hasn't previously allowed the site in the URL bar to access Canvas image data, **pure white image data** is returned to the Javascript APIs.\n\n* * *\n\nThis feature is also introduced to Firefox nightly and the upcoming Firefox 58 [[src]](https://www.ghacks.net/2017/10/28/firefox-58-warns-you-if-sites-use-canvas-image-data/):\n\n![firefox-canvas-image-data.png (0x0)](data/img/post_56_firefox-canvas-image-data.png)\n\nBut when I upload an image on ZeroMe, I don't receive any prompt.\n\n## Here is the solution:\n\n1.  Open `about:config` in address bar and set `permissions.memory_only` to `true`. [[ref]](https://tor.stackexchange.com/questions/957/html5-canvas-image-extraction/1014)\n\n    > By default, Tor Browser forgets about permissions when you close it. You can easily check it by revisiting Youtube (and see if it asks for permission again).\n    > \n    > If permissions.memory_only preference is set to false (default is true), Tor Browser stores permissions in a file named permissions.sqlite in the profile directory.\n\n2.  Temporarily allow popup permission for ZeroNet:\n    ![Bildschirmfoto_2017-11-18_08-11-29.png (0x0)](data/img/post_56_Bildschirmfoto_2017-11-18_08-11-29.png)\n    Choose `Further Information` like in the picture above, then choose `permissions` tab and allow popup permission.\n\n3.  Close Torbrowser, open Torbrowser profile folder (my location is `~/.tor-browser-de/INSTALL/Browser/TorBrowser/Data/Browser/profile.default`) and edit permissions.sqlite (I use sqlitebrowser)\n    Then under \"Search Data\", choose \"moz_perms\", change type `popup` to `canvas/extractData`. Done! [[ref]](https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/7bmmhp/how_do_you_accesschange_permissions_to_canvas/)\n\nBtw, this problem doesn't affect ZeroBlog.\n\nPS: I think a simple sqlite write command is enough to replace step 2 & 3\\. Just too lazy to learn about it now :P\n\nPS2: Is it safe to permanently allow ZeroNet to use Canvas image data? Yes as ZeroNet server is also on your computer, so you just send your Canvas fingerprint to yourself ;) Is it safe to permanently store permissions? No sure about this, if a website can read all your permissions, then not. If a website can read your permissions for it and use it as a fingerprint tracker, then it's better to forget the settings."

Lives are of enormous information, it's almost impossible to create a life in computer completely the same as real one, but rules and principles can be as brief as sentences, with limited rules we may still model life or generate life patterns in computer. Artificial life can also provide a tool to measure whether an experiment design and its model are strictly complete. If it can't be presented on computer, the model still lacks considering some essential factors.\n\n## 2\\. Basic Description\n\n## 2.1\\. World Structure\n\nWorld structure is actually the data structure. The usual structure is of matrix. Matrix can be with all kinds of inner structure. Like screen color matrix can be manifested as 2D matrix, and each pixel is of 3 values, on behalf of mix of the three basic colors: red, green and blue. The world itself doesn't have any special information, but can contain information. As for more possibility, it's better to design a world structure with more containers, but computer has its limit of computation and storage, we can't construct as many containers as we liked. Also in order to abstract the data into comprehensive and easily observing information, like changing objects on the screen, we may limit the size of the matrix according to the size of screen.\n\nAs mentioned above, the world can basically be a 2D matrix, then, to contain more kinds of information, every container can have one array or more, extremely the structure can be of matrix containing matrices. But this is not the end, every contained matrix can keep contains matrices iteratively, this is one way to generate incredible possibilities. Another way is to build a dynamic world. Exactly Iteration structure is as one kind of this, moreover, the same level of containers could move around and exchange, container could be generated or disappear in specific conditions. Designing Dynamic structure is a good way to save storage space of computer as well as generate more possibility, but it's hard to maintain.\n\nIf one basic matrix refers to one world, we also can construct several basic matrices as there are several worlds, and the worlds have some methods and conditions to share and exchange information with each other. While if we regard one basic 1D matrix as a mother world containing several child worlds, it will be the same. The difference of worlds is more about staticity or dynamicity, finity or infinity, and the structure of environment and life.\n\n## 2.2 Environment Factors\n\nAccording to the design, the world is just data container, it doesn't contain any actual information by itself, even the basic concepts, space and time. Space and time are included in the environment factors. Compared to the real world, environment here refers to the non-life being, including physical objects(such as all kinds of rocks, crystals with different ratio of elements, light, sound, air), physics principles(such as four basic reactions, energy-mass equality). It's better to just construct the environment with essential and simple factors and then it can organize itself into complex physical beings, furthermore, we also wish that life pattern can be automatically generated from non-life being. It's one of the ultimate goals of artificial life and currently it's almost clueless to attempt. So for compromising we abstract some well-understanding, easily constructing and observing environment factors, and make them serve the evolution of the life system.\n\nSpace and time are special factors. Basically, when we constructed 2D world, with 2D matrix we can represent every space cell in the mutual matrix cell, and the 2D matrix can be constructed with equally long arrays. And when we need construct 3D dimension, we can just replace every matrix cell with an array to represent the additional dimension, so do we need to add more dimensions. Time is no need to construct, we represent it with the velocity of environment and life objects, and it's limited by computing speed of CPU and efficiency of program.\n\nTo build other environment factors into the world structure, we can add additional values, array or other data structure to each of the space cell, to these values, we can design different behaviors and relationships to them. Compared to life object, environment should at least provide basic energy source, such as light, heat, generate basic action, such as random movement. Its factors can't have any intentional or even active behavior, they are always passive and led by life objects.\n\n## 2.3 Life Objects\n\nIt's too complicated to generally interpret what life is and how life works, at least, life is something that seems to oppose the physics fact ‚Äì entropy increase. Presently, in sort of behaviors and relationships, life objects can be divided into three types: producer, who absorbs energy from environment, consumer, who eat producer and weaker species of same type, decomposer, who can decompose producer and consumer. The common characteristics of life contains: made of cells, reproduce, obtain and use energy, grow and develop/repair, respond to environment/stimuli.[[1]](#footnote-) The design of life objects and its implementation with programming are according to these characteristics.\n\n## 3\\. Implementation\n\n## 3.1 Programming Tools Introduction\n\nI used Python as programming language. At first, I searched the Internet for artificial life code examples, what I found were only about Conway's Life Game ‚Äì a classic and basic artificial life design. There are several implement styles: the most simple style is printing matrixes one by one in the terminal.[[2]](#footnote-) As the size of the window is fix, it looks like a real animation. The second style is recording and playing the animation. From [http://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2013/08/07/conways-game-of-life/](http://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2013/08/07/conways-game-of-life/), the author used javascript to record the changing of matrix and ejected it as an animation, in his version, there is also play and pause buttons, which help us pause the animation and observe the static image. The third style is using real-time plot. Vispy is a project for creating interactive visualization in Python, It has the life game example in its github repository.[[3]](#footnote-) It uses OpenGL and has outstanding performance.\n\nReal-time is very important to artificial life because the iteration times of data we need are always very large and even unpredictable. The first style somehow is also real-time as it didn't use recording, but every output matrix is kept in the window, which produces a huge burden to computer memory. While using Vispy need special knowledge and programming ability of OpenGL. The project is still making efforts to wrap OpenGL into high-level API.\n\nSo I turned to searching real-time plotting tool in Python and finally devoted my project to PyQtGraph, a project for visualization in Qt4 ‚Äì which for creating User Interface in multi-platform. PyQtGraph has high performance in 2D plotting and also is easy to plot 3D object using OpenGL. Although there is not artificial life example in PyQtGraph, finally I successfully implemented my artificial life design with it.\n\n## 3.2 Project Design and Implementation\n\nAt first I explored the official examples of PyQtGraph and found out a real-time video item program.[[4]](#footnote-) I studied it and tried out my several small programs, like random movement tracker, randomly generating mergeable cells. Then I attempted to add several widgets like pause/resume button, but found that the Qt structure in the video item example was unable to add other widgets, other example from the official also couldn't suit my requirement. So I tried to find useful example directly from PyQt ‚Äì API implementation of Qt with Python language. By tutorial and examples from [http://zetcode.com/gui/pyqt4/](http://zetcode.com/gui/pyqt4/) I successfully established my user interface for my project. Finally I kept on the design and implementation of my project and completed a basic raw world.\n\nFigure 1: Raw World Version 1\n\n![image1.png (24x24)](data/img/post_52_image1.png)\n\nAs showed above, the raw world contains a main graphic layout and three widgets ‚Äì pause/resume button, time interval slider and four counters. In the graphic layout there are four kinds of object corresponding to the four counters. These four objects all move randomly in every time interval, when objects of same kind stayed in the same cell, they merged with brighter color, but their behaviors are somehow different. The grey ones are light bits. They are the major objects at the beginning. Imitating light in our real world, they can't merge with each other, when they stayed in the same cell, the color also got brighter, but in the next interval they would randomly divide. The green ones are producers. They can absorb light bit as energy and grow, give birth to baby in randomly adjacent cell when they mature and get extra energy, merge with each other when stay in the same cell and die when they exceed their brightness threshold. The red ones are consumers. They can eat producer. They merge, grow, mature, give birth and die the same as producer but can be set with different thresholds. The distinct difference is that when they saw decomposer two cells afront, which risked them to be killed by it, they would move toward the opposite of their direction. The blue ones are decomposer. They can decompose producer and consumer into light bits, in the meantime, they split into two in the opposite direction if they are big enough. They also split when they got too large. As currently designed, they never die or give birth, except being merged, their population is always the same.\n\nAs the code showed from appendix, from line 115 to 126, there are several attributes, smallest objects are displayed as BIT on RGBa color system, their RGB values are fix and the alpha value will decide individual difference of same kind. The raw world is wrapped in the class EnvAndLife from line 130 to 453\\. At first, from line 131 to 170, I used pseudorandom number generating function generate random distribution for each kind of object. With r ‚Äì a zero to one random number matrix ‚Äì at line 133, 138, 143, 148, etc, the initial population can be set as we want. At line 178, 300, etc, a temporary matrix is set to store objects after their movements so that every individual won't interfere each other in the procedure of update of movement. Although iteration is used to change movement, with the temporary matrix every object will still move at the same time in every time interval. At line 188, 191, etc, \"%\" is a modulus, with it object can move from edge of the world to the opposite edge. As showed at line 195, 317, etc, after update of behaviors, the temporary matrix is copied into the origin data.\n\nAt line 186, 219, etc, a four integer random sequence is generated, it's using for random movement. There is one interesting phenomenon by four direction movement, that every adjacent object never interferes with each other or stays in the same cell if we don't set extra behavior, because in every update, they can exchange place but cannot move to the same place. If so, there will be actually two worlds. From line 261 to 290 it's the birth giving function, with it, producer or consumer can give birth a baby in the adjacent cell, as a result, an object especially a light bit can move into another phase by transforming into a producer or consumer first.\n\nProducers or consumers can die and transform into light bit if their alpha value is too big, as showed from line 310 to 314, 328 to 332, or if they encounter decomposer. Light bit, producer and consumer, their minimal alpha value are all 20 (line 119 to 121), but decomposer are 60 (line 122), it's because decomposer never transform into other kinds of object, Setting value of 60 helps them clearly display in the screen. To the world, the total alpha value of all the objects never changes, this is to imitate Energy Equivalence.\n\n## 3.3 Program Testing and Utilitarization\n\nWhen testing program as table 1 shown below, the threshold of r value for envdata is 0.7 (line 138), which mean in world of size 100_100, the possible maximum amount of all objects is approximately: (1 - 0.7)_0.5_100_100 = 1500\n\nTable 1: Speed Testing of the Program\n\n| Size of the World | Update Times | Special Condition | 1/sec | 2/sec | 3/sec | 4/sec | 5/sec | Average/sec |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 100*100 | 100 | None | 4.383 | 4.183 | 4.249 | 4.185 | 4.302 | 4.260 |\n| 100*100 | 100 | Cancel Environment Energy Update | 2.399 | 2.445 | 2.475 | 2.354 | 2.429 | 2.420 |\n| 100*100 | 100 | Cancel All Three Life Objects Update | 3.596 | 3.505 | 3.529 | 3.500 | 3.495 | 3.525 |\n| 100*100 | 100 | Cancel Counting Widget | 3.254 | 3.186 | 3.287 | 3.291 | 3.186 | 3.241 |\n| 100*100 | 1000 | None | 39.55 | 38.00 | 38.85 | 38.16 | 38.78 | 38.67 |\n| 100*200 | 100 | None | 8.569 | 8.481 | 8.569 | 8.457 | 8.347 | 8.485 |\n| 200*200 | 100 | None | 18.76 | 18.79 | 18.63 | 18.78 | 18.57 | 18.71 |\n| 200*300 | 100 | None | 43.49 | 44.13 | 43.55 | 43.12 | 43.54 | 43.57 |\n\nAs shown above, In a world of 100_100 cells, with smallest time interval setting(1millisecond), currently running time of the program is approximately 4.260 seconds in the first 100 updates. Since the world keeps changing after update, in the first 1000 updates, running time will become around 38.67 seconds. It's because the amount of light bits is decreasing quickly at the beginning. If extending the world to 100_200 cells, it takes about 8.485 seconds, which is almost double of the first one. Also in the world of 200_200 cells, it takes about 18.71 seconds, it's about double of world of 100_200 cells. It seems spending time is linear to the size of the world. But when the world is of 200*300 cells, the running time will increase to about 43.57 seconds. It seems time cost is exploding. I found out it's somehow because of pixel rendering, I zoomed out the pixels to keep more cells in the windows of same size and it went like this, while when I just expanded the windows instead of changing the size of pixels, the running time decreased to about 31 seconds, nevertheless, to the size of the world, the time cost was not linear.\n\nThe cost of time most comes from the update of light bits. If we cancel the it, time cost will decrease from 4.260 to 2.420, while if we cancel the update of all three life objects, time cost just decreases to 3.525\\. It seems that using dictionary to store life objects is a good choice, which avoids many void calculations of matrix. Hence the world can add many more life objects and still has good performance.\n\nCurrently this version can just generate a stable world. In testing, I didn't find any outstanding pattern. As life objects are modeled to imitate producer, consumer and decomposer, the world can be used to do ecology experiments. Actually there are many variables in this raw world, changing them and observing the world may attain some valuable principles.\n\nIn one developing version, there is a special pattern as shown below:\n\nFigure 2: A Special Pattern\n\n![image2.png (24x24)](data/img/post_52_image2.png)\n\nIn this version there is still no decomposers. According to the design, the life objects in mature pass all energy(alpha value) to baby it absorbs or eats. Consequently, the objects never die if they don't merge with others or be killed by others. With a lot of energy or foods around, the objects keep multiplying and generating such a pattern. Because the default maximum of alphavalue is 255\\. As tested, if there are too many alpha values of objects exceeding 1000, the display of the world will crash. It's the ending of this version.\n\nAs objects almost keep random movements in the raw world, it's still very amazing to generate such a pattern. In artificial life, it can be called as an attractor. If the world was sound, further observation and research can be taken. What are the conditions to generate such a pattern? How large the pattern can be with limited energy in the world? What is happening at the edge of it?\n\n## 4\\. Expectations\n\nFirst, as describing above, now lifespan is determined by alpha value, which restrains the world to be more flexible and sounder. So I plan to add additional container to store age. With it the lifespan will determine by the update times of the world so that lifespan will also approach more to it in our reality.\n\nSecondly, I plan to add some combining rules to the world. For example, as consumers eat producers but avoid decomposers in their movements, if producers combine with decomposers and move together with them, they will have higher probability to survive. With combining rules, the world may be also easier to generate patterns.\n\nThirdly, I plan to extend the world into 3D dimension. As shown above, in the developing version the objects will converge in an area, we can consider it that the environment is under high pressure. There are two methods to release it, one is that the environment digests it by itself. The other is that some of the objects jump into other dimension. This is also one way to extend 2D world into 3D. Exactly I wish that some rules which are only set in the 2D dimension can automatically extend to other dimensions.\n\n## Footnote:\n\n[1] Copied from [http://hwp.ocps.net/tl/knoxs/Links/5MainCharacteristicsofLife.htm](http://hwp.ocps.net/tl/knoxs/Links/5MainCharacteristicsofLife.htm)\n[2] [http://usingpython.com/programs/#life](http://usingpython.com/programs/#life)\n[3] [https://github.com/vispy/vispy/blob/master/examples/demo/game-of-life.py](https://github.com/vispy/vispy/blob/master/examples/demo/game-of-life.py)\n[4] In the official package, it came from examples/graphics item/ImageItem/video.\n\nSource code: [https://github.com/stbinan/raw-world](https://github.com/stbinan/raw-world)"

For the aspect of algorithm, the filter first tries to exclude any posts according to the opt-out languages that a user have selected, then tries to exclude any posts that are not in the opt-in languages that have been selected.\n\n* * *\n\nMatching unicode block range is like comparing a number with a min and a max number, so it costs little, I also just select less than 100 characters of body to sacrifice a bit accuracy for speed. For pc this method is very efficient, it takes about 3s to get the result. But for remote server and clearnet proxy, it takes about 30s...\n\nThe client needs to download all posts to match and then upload the unique integer pair list to server to query result. As there are a lot of posts, and the unique integer pair list can be very long, so downloading and uploading will generate lots of traffic and so take quite some time. In contrast, this is also one of the advantages of ZeroNet ;) as server and client are in the same machine.\n\nBy using ZeroNet4Android app, the speed is also very slow. I check the benchmark and find that values related to dbQuery are very slow compare to X86 pc. I use Kindle HDX Thor tablet for testing, so it's not because of hardware. Maybe it's because that ZeroNet is not efficient in ARM deivce, or ZeroNet4Android app still needs some improvement, or database read & write speed is generally very slow in ARM architecture.\n\nAnd I have another idea for improving speed, by pre-tagging the language type of post to the database, then I just need to use some keywords to query the result. But after reading some codes about how ZeroNet handles database, I find it's not doable for the current ZeroMe.\n\nZeroNet uses `dbschema.json` to tell SQLite how to store data into `.db` file, the `dbschema.json` uses `map` to read json file like `data.json`, `content.json` in the zite. So for pre-tagging language type to ZeroMe, we need to modify all users' data.json in order to add language type to every post ;_; So this idea is for the next generation of ZeroNet zites...\n\nPS: my language filter can only filter languages that have different language character, so it's useless if you want to only filter English, because English shares many Latin characters with French, German, Spainish... As [one of my ZeroMe posts](/Me.ZeroNetwork.bit/?Post/1oranGeS2xsKZ4jVsu9SVttzgkYXu4k9v/1AWwhg4EiWAVttfQboJZ4wJfX3WawfJT3h/1506152360) mentioned, filtering language is also an old issue for Mastodon, currently they use user locale to fitler language, which is not possible for ZeroNet and also very inaccurate.\n\nOnce I read a conversation, one guy said that the ideal condition of communication is: everyone just uses their native language, then effectively communicates with other language speakers by translation machine. I agree that a high quality universal translator is a better solution than a language filter. As translator is a bridge that helps people from different culture communicate with each other, while language filter is a wall that isolates people just because they can't find a good way to understand each other. Here is also my small proposal about building a decentralized language translation machine:\n\n> Compare to language filter, high quality language translator is a better solution for multi-language social network (and the world), DeepL may be capable for the work, but ideally we need a decentralized language translator to avoid all kind of bad things, decline and possible disaster generated by those cheap centralism and monopoly. But yes, it may be still too expensive now.\n> \n> Also the translator should add as many languages as it can. A condition that minor languages get overwhelmed by limited/small amount of major languages is not fair enough.\n\nAnd some rough ideas about how to make it:\n\nPeers that store large mount of multi-language data - like ipfs wikipedia and wiktionary, in future zeronet may also maintain one. Match noun/verd/text with same meaning/... of different languages and train the translator using AI, guess the mechanism will be similar to bitcoin network, the data trained by a peer pass some thresholds or have a higher score will be added to the whole data tree. Lightweight translator software and quick translation. A mode that user can choose the best translation result from candidates or manually improve the result to help the score system."

			"body": "We can follow posts, comments, mentions from ZeroBlog, ZeroMe, ZeroTalk, etc. But can we also follow update of zites that have no follow buttons? Yes we can :3\nZeroHello feed-follow feature is actually by reading \"follow\" keyword and sqlite command from `/path/to/zeronet/data/users.json`. So even a zite has no follow function, you can create one for yourself.\n\n[From ZeroNet doc](https://zeronet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/site_development/zeroframe_api_reference/#plugin-newsfeed), five columns are necessary for the SQL query: type, date_added, body, title, url.\n\nSome examples:\nFollowing new submitted zites in German from ZeroSites:\n\n```\n          \"New De Zite\": [\n            \"SELECT 'post' AS type, title || ' -> 192.168.1.110:43110/' || address AS title, '' AS url, date_added, description AS body FROM site WHERE language = 'de'\", \n            [\n              \"\"\n            ]\n          ]\n```\n\nFollowing page \"hubs\" changes from ZeroWiki:\n\n```\n    \"New Change From Page hubs\": [\n            \"SELECT 'post' AS type, 'New Change From Page hubs' AS title, '?Page:hubs' AS url, date_added, '' AS body FROM pages WHERE slug = 'hubs'\", \n            [\n              \"\"\n            ]\n          ]\n```\n\nNeed to restart ZeroNet server to take effect. We also need to create a follow keyword under the zite address in users.json if there is no one, so for ZeroWiki, the full recipe is (be aware of the comma at the end of every item except the last one, you'd better **backup** your users.json before directly edit it):\n\n```\n  \"138R53t3ZW7KDfSfxVpWUsMXgwUnsDNXLP\": {\n    \"auth_address\": ...,\n    \"auth_privatekey\": ...,\n    \"cert\": \"zeroid.bit\"\n  },\n```\n\nto\n\n```\n  \"138R53t3ZW7KDfSfxVpWUsMXgwUnsDNXLP\": {\n    \"auth_address\": ...,\n    \"auth_privatekey\": ...,\n    \"follow\": {\n      \"New Change From Page hubs\": [\n            \"SELECT 'post' AS type, 'New Change From Page hubs' AS title, '?Page:hubs' AS url, date_added, '' AS body FROM pages WHERE slug = 'hubs'\", \n            [\n              \"\"\n            ]\n      ]\n    },\n    \"cert\": \"zeroid.bit\"\n  },\n```\n\nBut for some zites this method doesn't work.\nFor ZeroMusic there is no `date_added` table in database... But it's necessary for the follow command.\nI tried to use current time:\n\n```\n        \"New music\": [\n            \"SELECT 'post' AS type, 'New Submitted Music' AS title, '' AS url, strftime('%s', 'now') AS date_added, artist || ': ' || title AS body FROM songs  ORDER BY id DESC limit 10\", \n            [\n              \"\"\n            ]\n    ]\n```\n\nBut didn't work and caused some trouble: On Icecat Mobile the screen kept flashing on ZeroHello...\nI also tried to use a specific unix time, still nothing showed up.\n\nFor ZeroMail I try to add a follow command for receiving new messages:\n\n```\n    \"New Message\": [\n            \"SELECT 'post' AS type, 'New Message' AS title, '' AS url, date_added, '' AS body FROM message LEFT JOIN json USING (json_id) WHERE directory = '1AWwhg4EiWAVttfQboJZ4wJfX3WawfJT3h'\", \n            [\n              \"\"\n            ]\n          ]\n```\n\nBut after I added it to users.json, after a moment (even that I didn't restart zeronet yet), the follow command disappeared from users.json...\n\nThis feature is very flexible, with \"LIKE\" sql function you can filter content with keywords. For example, to follow topics that the title contains zeronet keyword:\n\n```\n    \"New ZeroNet-Related Topic\": [\n            \"SELECT 'post' AS type, title, '?Topic:' || topic.topic_id || '_' || topic_creator_json.directory AS url, added AS date_added, body FROM topic LEFT JOIN json AS topic_creator_json ON (topic_creator_json.json_id = topic.json_id) WHERE title LIKE '%zeronet%'\", \n            [\n              \"\"\n            ]\n          ]\n```\n\nCheck your users.json for more examples. That's all.\n\nPS1: I find that if I shut down ZeroNet and add follow command to ZeroMail, then restart ZeroNet, I can receive new message feed from ZeroMail. But... those messages are the one I sent, there is also a table named secret, but after some test guess it's my contact list, so the command is meaningless X("

By comparing the code between ZeroMusic and ZeroMessage, I come to a conclusion that these browsers don't support Javascript class, which was introduced in ES6 (ECMAScript 2015).\n\nZeroMusic and all official zites are written in coffeescript, and when compiling coffeescript, Classes will be compiled into functions, so they have better compatibility, but the compiled Javascripts are really ugly. So if the author doesn't provide the coffeescript source code... Wonder if it's possible to compile (reverse-engineer) javascript back to brief coffeescript.\n\n`Babel` and `Traceur` can be used to compile ES6 javascript to ES5, I've tried both of them for ZeroMessage. The result of Babel is similar to coffeescript, looks very ugly, also the compiled js can't be directly used for my zite, needs further work. The code changed a little by using Traceur, but it looks like I need an extra `traceur-runtime.js` lib, haven't try it yet.\n\nIn conclusion, probably I'll give up the compatibility.\n\nAlso [yet another Javascript joke](https://github.com/babel/gulp-babel/issues/52):\n\n*   Issue: Unable to transpile ES6 > ES5\n*   Closing for inactivity and seems like too many different issues."

Also you should bind your ip to your devices in the router config panel. [[ref - Is it possible to install ZeroNet to a remote machine?]](https://zeronet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq/)\n    Also with a terminal app like [ConnectBot](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.connectbot/) or [Termux](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.termux/), you can use [the method](/Me.ZeroNetwork.bit/?Post/12h51ug6CcntU2aiBjhP8Ns2e5VypbWWtv/1GnJD7CXskmG8GywMbTvbP12wneCFW9XzR/1483533203) mentioned by weakish:\n\n    > Alternatively, you can just start ZeroNet on remote machine as normal, without --ui_ip, UiPassword, reverse proxy, SSL, etc.\n    > And run this command at local machine:\n    > `ssh -L 43110:127.0.0.1:43110 -N username@remote`\n    > Then you can just access [http://127.0.0.1:43110/](http://127.0.0.1:43110/) on your local machine, securely.\n\n*   Access by [ZeroNet-kivy](https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet-kivy), it's also available on [Google Play - ZeroNet4Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.mkg20001.zeronet) and on this zite [ZeroNet Android](/1A9gZwjdcTh3bpdriaWm7Z4LNdUL8GhDu2/) by the author mkg20001.\n    **[Alert]**: Currently ZeroNet-kivy stores sensitive data like your users.json as well as your private keys in the internal storge, which can be read by any other apps that have \"internel storage\" permission. So only use it for testing.\n\n*   Access by [Termux Android](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.termux/), here is [a script](https://github.com/PeterCxy/Termux-ZeroNet) to automate everything. `greenlet` clang patch has been merged to main stream, so you can change it to `pip2 install greenlet` in the script.\n\n*   Access by [Linuxdeploy](https://github.com/meefik/linuxdeploy/) Android, here is [a rough tutorial](/1EiMAqhd6sMjPG2tznkkGXxhdwFBDdeqT9/?Post:73) for it.\n    Note 1: When you can run ZeroNet with terminal, you can save battery by disabling `Chart` plugins (by renaming Chart to disabled-Chart), also you can start ZeroNet with `--log_level INFO` (Rev3321), suggested by Nofish)\n\n*   Access by [SSH tunnel](https://lignux.com/zeronet-en-android/) (Spanish)\n\n*   Access by clearnet proxy [[List of working proxies]](/138R53t3ZW7KDfSfxVpWUsMXgwUnsDNXLP/?Page:proxies)\n    Note 1: if the list is blank or looks incomplete, check `History` for a complete version.\n    Note 2: You can also [Deploy ZeroNet to Heroku as a public proxy service in one click, and host it for free!](https://www.reddit.com/r/zeronet/comments/7gzre8/deploy_zeronet_to_heroku_as_a_public_proxy/)\n\n## Mobile Improvement for Zites:\n\n*   ZeroHello, ZeroMe and ZeroTalk are already mobile friendly.\n\n*   ZeroBlog:\n\n    *   [Updated ZeroBlog with Tag Index and Mobile Support](/15mSYzsDxzarssqtV1pFPKqoCTaLdjVB2f/)\n    *   [Minimal and Beautiful ZeroBlog Themed by ZAlex](/1A5nKj7XV3SqU9CdAtpnYu7eqiaSHKcj9X/)\n    *   [Poster](/1J2ZJjs97wEcW36x5d9f1QnPVPVDv8wbJ/)\n        A simple blog platform for ZeroNet written from scratch using Vue.js and Bulma.\n*   ZeroMail: [[ZeroMail Mobile Simple Solution]](/1EiMAqhd6sMjPG2tznkkGXxhdwFBDdeqT9/?Post:40)\n    For ZeroMail, the userstyle file is also provided [here](/1EiMAqhd6sMjPG2tznkkGXxhdwFBDdeqT9/shared/zeronet-mobile.userstyle.css). If you prefer dark theme, check [A Dark Theme for ZeroNet](/1EiMAqhd6sMjPG2tznkkGXxhdwFBDdeqT9/?Post:3), the mobile improvement is included.\n\n*   Note 1: Besides installing the css code with Stylish, you can directly add it to ZeroMail, create a file named all2.css in `/path/to/zite/css/`, copy the css code (except the first line which starts with `@-moz-document` and the last `}`) to it, then copy `/path/to/zite/index.html` to `/path/to/zite/index2.html`, inside index2.html, change the code\n\n    ```\n    ...\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"css/all.css\" />\n    ...\n    ```\n\n    to\n\n    ```\n    ...\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"css/all.css\" />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"css/all2.css\" />\n    ...\n    ```\n\n    Then visit your zite and add index2.html at the end of the address. Like `http:/127.0.0.1:43110/Mail.ZeroNetwork.bit//index2.html` for ZeroMail, same with ZeroSites, ZeroBoard, etc.\n\n## Browser Recommendation (Android):\n\n*   [Icecat Mobile](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.gnu.icecat/): 100% freesoftware. For me this one is with the best compatibility. ~~But also the most laggy one...~~ Icecat 52.3 is quite smooth, recommended.\n\n*   [Orfox from Guardian Project](https://guardianproject.info/apps/): Torbrowser for Android, so you can use it to block all harmful clearnet connections, but ZeroMe image upload doesn't work with this browser.\n    You need to also install Orbot (Tor android) or Orfox will complain it when starting. After install it, enter `about:config` and search for `no_proxy`, add your remote machine ip and/or localhost like: `192.168.1.xxx:43110, 127.0.0.1:43110`. If you want the Stylish add-on, you can also add the related add-on download address. I use the adb method instead: `adb shell am start -a android.intent.action.VIEW -c android.intent.category.DEFAULT -d file:///mnt/sdcard/Download/ -n info.guardianproject.orfox/.App` [[ref]](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36049137/installing-unsigned-xpis-in-firefox-for-android-version-42-or-newer)\n\n*   [Lightning Browser](https://f-droid.org/packages/acr.browser.lightning/) (recommended by Musickiller): brings really fast experience. Also ZeroChat doesn't work in this browser (Probably because it doesn't support JavaScript class, which was introduced in ES6 (ECMAScript 2015)).\n    For privacy concern, you may like to change startpage and default search engine to Duckduckgo or Searx (the query url format is [https://instance.url/?q=](https://instance.url/?q=), I also add `!go !ddg !wp !wd` because Bing and Yahoo suck).\n    Edit: Now part of ZeroNet `uimedia.js` code is ES6, like the notification (including `mute`, `update` button), and they don't work in Lightning Browser.\n\n*   Note1: If the font size is too big or too small, you can change it in Settings.\n\n*   Note2: Some zites may support mobile mode but the owner didn't add viewport setting to it, in this case, you can contact the owner to add `\"viewport\": \"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\",` in her/his content.json [[ref]](https://zeronet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/site_development/content_json/), or force viewport in your browser: for Lightning Browser, uncheck `Use wide viewport` in Settings -> Display Settings. For Orfox or Icecat Mobile, search `viewport` in `about:config`, then change `browser.viewport.desktopWidth` to a smaller value, for me is 400.\n\n## Issues and Troubleshootings:\n\n*   In some browser the \"0\" button is not clickable or need to tap twice, so use bookmark to access ZeroHello instead. Also the config panel is not very reactive, so you can try to refresh the screen (like for \"This is my site\" switcher) or tap the button more than one time to make it work.\n*   [Fixed] On ZeroMe Mobile many image previews are blank. Weird bug, but you can still touch the screen twice to get the fullsize image.\n\n## Credits:\n\n*   Thank Nofish and other ZeroNet devs for this awesome project!\n\n*   Thank Mkg20001 for the ZeroNet-kivy app!\n\n*   Also thank every active ZeroNet fellows :3\n\n## Edit:\n\n[171117] Polish section - Mobile Improvement for Zites\n[291017] Add alert for ZeroNet-kivy Android app. Thank shouko for sharing it.\n[030817] Remove \"Independent Scroll for Panels in ZeroHello\".\n[010817] Add `ZeroHello Mobile`, `Minimal and Beautiful ZeroBlog Themed by ZAlex` to Mobile Improvement for Zites. Remove viewport setting suggestion.\n[240717] Change Note 1 to a harmless method. Add more explanation to browser recommendation."

I use the awesome [meld tool](http://meldmerge.org/) and merge the code base, also add ~~experimental~~ mobile support ;)\n\n![Bildschirmfoto_2017-07-15_17-09-41.png (24x24)](data/img/post_37_Bildschirmfoto_2017-07-15_17-09-41.png)\n\nGet it from [this zite](/15mSYzsDxzarssqtV1pFPKqoCTaLdjVB2f) if you don't need the buggy (:P) ZeroMessage plugin. Also [the source code](/1M5dciFFSWt4wKs9Nnxa34BgGnt7os7h3v/) is available on Git Center.\n\nYou can clone the blog from 3-dot menu near the zite on ZeroHello, but you may prefer to merge it to your present blog:\nBackup your blog first, then edit the `content.json` in your blog root directory and change the `\"cloned_from\": \"...\"` to `\"cloned_from\": \"15mSYzsDxzarssqtV1pFPKqoCTaLdjVB2f\"`, then go to ZeroHello, from the site option (click the 3-dot button near your blog) and choose `Upgrade code`. That's all.\n\nIf it doesn't work, simply copy all the folders and files except `content.json` and `data` folder in the root directory of your blog (which contains your blog data and user comments). Finally from the config panel (drag the \"0\" button to left to open it), sign and publish your new blog, reload and rebuild your database. You may also need to restart your web browser to refresh the css code.\n\n## Bugs and Troubleshootings:\n\n[Fixed] There's a little random chance that tags will duplicate themselves... It's bug that already exists in the original version.

			"body": "I modify ZeroChat from [the official tutorial](/Blog.ZeroNetwork.bit/?Post:99:ZeroChat+tutorial+new) and transform it info a widget that can be added to any (not quite sure though :P) zite.\n\n![Bildschirmfoto_2017-07-10_09-05-28.png (24x24)](data/img/post_35_Bildschirmfoto_2017-07-10_09-05-28.png)\n\nCheck [my Jekyll zite](/1ADGCZCvC6wCf5GwCY23H9uwKyRiixoLt6/) for the example and code.\n\nTo use it, you need to copy `zeromessage` folder and `dbschema.json` to the root folder of your zite, if your zite has one `dbschema.json`, you need to merge the table inside (need to carefully compare them and add the necessary part).\nRespectively, if your zite has no `./data/users/content.json`, then you need to follow the official tutorial and create one, also modify `./content.json`:\n\n* * *\n\n> To allow other users to post on our site we have to define the rules of the third-party content.\n> Create a data/users/content.json file in your site‚Äôs directory:\n\n```\n{\n  \"files\": {},\n  \"ignore\": \".*\",\n  \"modified\": 0.0,\n  \"signs\": {},\n  \"user_contents\": {\n    \"cert_signers\": {\n      \"zeroid.bit\": [ \"1iD5ZQJMNXu43w1qLB8sfdHVKppVMduGz\" ]\n    },\n    \"permission_rules\": {\n      \".*\": {\n        \"files_allowed\": \"data.json\",\n        \"max_size\": 10000\n      },\n      \"bitmsg/.*@zeroid.bit\": { \"max_size\": 15000 }\n    },\n    \"permissions\": {\n      \"bad@zeroid.bit\": false,\n      \"nofish@zeroid.bit\": { \"max_size\": 100000 }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n> After we saved this file we also have to modify our site‚Äôs root content.json to ignore everything in this directory on signing and load the file containing the rules:\n\n```\n  ...\n    \"ignore\": \"data/.*\",\n    \"includes\": {\n        \"data/users/content.json\": {\n            \"signers\": [],\n            \"signers_required\": 1\n        }\n    },\n  ...\n```\n\nFinally, you need to copy this block of code to `./index.html`, the proper position is in the bottom, before `</body>`:\n\n```\n <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"zeromessage/all.js\"> </script>\n <div id=\"zeromessage\" class=\"zeromessage\"></div>\n```\n\nIf you perfer a white theme, you can remove `./zeromessage/all.css` and rename `./zeromessage/white-all.css` to `./zeromessage/all.css`.\n\nDon't forget to sign and publish your zite from the config panel (drag the \"0\" button to left to open it). That's all!\n\nPS0: It's still a little buggy in ZeroBlog, afaik ZeroFrame calling of ZeroMessage is in conflict with ZeroBlog, have no solution yet. If you still want to try it in your blog, you can use the dbschema.json in [my ZeroBlog](/1EiMAqhd6sMjPG2tznkkGXxhdwFBDdeqT9/) instead.\n\nPS1: for some zite that already has `dsschema.json`, there's another necessary step¬†(for ZeroUp it is not needed).\nUse ZeroBlog as example, you need to find the initial user data table in `./js/all.js` or any `./data/users/.../data.json` (I can easily find it by searching `JSON.parse`):\n\n```\n          if (data) {\n            data = JSON.parse(data);\n          } else {\n            data = {\n              \"next_comment_id\": 1,\n              \"comment\": [],\n              \"comment_vote\": {},\n              \"topic_vote\": {}\n            };\n          }\n```\n\nThen add the table to `./zeromessage/all.js`:\n\n```diff\n            if (data)  // Parse current data file\n                data = JSON.parse(data)\n            if (data == null)\n-              data = {}\n+              data = {\n+                \"next_comment_id\": 1,\n+                \"comment\": [],\n+                \"comment_vote\": {},\n+                \"topic_vote\": {}\n+              }\n            if (data.zm_message == null)  // Not exists yet, add message key\n                data.zm_message = []\n```\n\nHope it works for you ;)\n\nPS2: Thanks to the source code from [ZeroNet Dev Center](/14pM9huTYzJdyQyHRj6v2kfhMe8DrxwpGt/). Now ZeroMessage has follow button. Also I figure that ZeroHello feed-follow feature is by reading \"follow\" keyword and sqlite command from `/path/to/zeronet/data/users.json`. So even a zite has no follow function, you can create one for yourself, for example, if you just want to follow username mention in ZeroMessage, you can add something like this under the \"follow\" keyword (check other zite in users.json for example, also remember to **backup** users.json file first before directly edit it):\n\n```\n          \"Zm-message mention\": [\n            \"SELECT 'mention' AS type, 'ZeroMessage' AS title, '' AS url, date_added, cert_user_id || ': ' || body AS body FROM zm_message LEFT JOIN json USING (json_id) WHERE body LIKE '%@binchan%'\", \n            [\n              \"\"\n            ]\n```\n\nNeed to restart ZeroNet server to take effect."

			"title": "Done Migrating my Cleannet Apps to New Server",
			"date_published": 1499033782.4,
			"body": "Recently I'm struggling migrating my three apps to a new server, from Debian Jessie to Stretch. The progress is exhausting, the solution is simple, the experience is... horrible X::\n\ntl;dr (Just some memo)\n\n* * *\n\nThe first one is a rails toy app + postgresql + nginx. When I finished it according to a rails tutorial, it's based on ruby 2.1, later I updated bundle gems to ruby 2.2 in development mode and pushed the code to github, but I never deployed it to production. So when migrating it, I tried to upgrade my code to the new version.\nI set up my new server with Debian Jessie, but Jessie only contains ruby 2.1\\. As recently Stretch came out. So I decided to upgrade my system first. The upgrade process was quite smooth, anyway I was upgrading from a brand new Jessie. But... Debian Stretch comes with ruby 2.3, so relative gems need to update again. After tens of `bundle install` and version changes to gems. `bundle install` passed... Yeah, and first of all `gem install bundler` to update bundle info from ruby 2.1 to ruby 2.3.\n\nThen I still needed to migrate database. That part of memory is a little unclear. Just like the app had been set up for a long time and I almost forget how to set up database, what the database user password and database password are. So that I did lots of online searches was another story... and there're still some new bugs in the app will be another story...\n\nYeah, the solution of the first app doesn't look simple, if I didn't want to update my code. The solutions of the other two apps are quite simple.\n\nThe second one is GnuSocial + mysql/mariadb + nginx. I got 502 bad Gateway, and all I needed was to change the php-fpm socket in nginx profile to the one in `/etc/php/7.0/fpm/pool.d/my...`. But all tutorials of Gnusocial deployment are all around php5, and even from the [nightly branch introduction](https://git.gnu.io/gnu/gnu-social/commit/58274c99d48f29d05f0a29474dc922ef42a3648b), it's said php7 is experimental and not necessarily working... With some try, not luck. So I asked [Gnusocial group](https://gnusocial.club/group/421/id) for help, and someone hit me with this:\n\n> I didn't have issues with php7 and GS, y u torture yourself\n\nYeah, knowing it worked really gave me enough hope to achieve my goal (before I had considered re-set up my server to Jessie...). I even did a fresh installation and finally targeted the bug was from nginx setting (or nginx version...), because apache2 works! And the cause tracking returned to the starting point: [why did I get 502 bad Gateway](https://www.scalescale.com/tips/nginx/502-bad-gateway-error-using-nginx/)... Other problems were quick to solve. Like installing missing package, figuring out the new mysql database password mismatched with the old one...\n\nThe third one is Mediagoblin + postgresql + nginx. All I needed was to change numpy to an older version. But how could I know it's so simple? The logs raised issue but didn't provide solution. I just knew my first attempt to migrate my app failed, there was something wrong, maybe the app is not compatible with Stretch... Migrating isn't like fresh installation. I need to follow the deployment instruction to install dependencies and set up basic environment, but not to introduce new bugs... I've added quite some other things to the app, and if one of the gears has issue, the whole machine won't work. Bug tracking isn't easily work. Because there can be many possible causes, and many possible solutions...\n\nYeah, and Mediagoblin needs npm, but Stretch drops official support for it. I don't like to introduce third party repository at the moment to my brand new server and system. Anyway, npm is just javascript package management, and those packages are already in my mediagolbin folder (I just check them when I'm writing this memo :P).\n\nNumpy is for audio support. But even I disabled audio plugin, the app didn't begin, (because) in my database there is a audio file. And that's enough to make the app totally not able to initiate. Maybe I can drop the related table from the datebase, never tried before.\n\nAnd I also forgot to start the mediagoblin service and keep getting 502 bad Gateway, considering the (magic) from the second app, I tweaked the related php-fpm socket, and got no good result, (obviously)...\n\nThankfully everything returns to its normal track and I can return to some more creative work :3"

			"body": "Still remember [my ZeroMe Feedbot](/1EiMAqhd6sMjPG2tznkkGXxhdwFBDdeqT9/?Post:22:ZeroMe+Feed+Bot), here is a rebranded feedbot for ZeroTalk :3\nThe installation will be a little easier because you don't need to create another ID.\n\n![Bildschirmfoto_2017-06-28_11-40-14.png (0x0)](data/img/post_33_Bildschirmfoto_2017-06-28_11-40-14.png)\n\n* * *\n\nA python 3 script that will turn a ZeroTalk clone into a RSS feed bot and more.\n\n> RSS (Rich Site Summary; originally RDF Site Summary; often called Really Simple Syndication) uses a family of standard web feed formats to publish frequently updated information: blog entries, news headlines, audio, video. An RSS document (called \"feed\", \"web feed\", or \"channel\") includes full or summarized text, and metadata, like publishing date and author's name. [Src:Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS)\n\n[How to Subscribe to RSS Feeds](http://rss-tutorial.com/rss-how-to-subscribe-to-feeds.htm)\n\n## How to Install:\n\n1.  Clone a ZeroTalk, then login your ZeroTalk with your ID and create a random topic to generate your profile. Then you may like to edit `/path/to/your/zerotalk/data/users/content.json` and change the `max_size`, or your data.json will fail to sign if it reaches the limit. After changing the `max_size`, you need to sign (and publish) your ZeroTalk from the right config panel (drag the '0' button to left).\n\n2.  Add [Git Center](/gitcenter.bit/) and [my messy repo](/13zzNGxEXDeLxHEGZdG3mE7G8dChf45LrV), clone my messy repo: `git clone /path/to/zeronet/data/13zzNGxEXDeLxHEGZdG3mE7G8dChf45LrV/binchan-s-messy-repo.git`, then copy `FeedBot-ZeroTalk` folder in my repo to your ZeroNet root directory.\n\n3.  Add your feeds:\n    There are two way to add your feeds:\n    One way is to directly copy your feed url to `rssAddresses.txt`, one url one line.\n    The other way is by creating a topic with your bot ZeroTalk account. The title format is `add-feed YOUR_FEED_URL`. Your can also delete your feed with `del-feed URL`. That's cool, isn't it ;)\n    Check [this article](/1EiMAqhd6sMjPG2tznkkGXxhdwFBDdeqT9/?Post:25:Directly+Parsing+Website+Content+to+Feedbot) if you want something like a torrent site with magnet link. To use it you also need to create a file named `htmlAddresses.txt` in the `FeedBot-ZeroTalk` folder.\n\n4.  Run the script:\n    Install package dependency `feedparser`, `html2text` and `beautifulsoup4`:\n\n    ```\n    pip3 install html2text beautifulsoup4 --user\n    ```\n\n    For `feedparser`, clone the branch with timeout function (Check Bug and Troubleshooting below) and install it (Default is 30 seconds, check [this](https://github.com/kurtmckee/feedparser/pull/80)): `$ git clone https://github.com/JPFrancoia/feedparser && cd feedparser && python3 setup.py install --user`. Then simply run it with `$ python3 feedbot.py` .\n    If you want to run it periodically, you can use `$ while sleep TIME_INTERVAL_IN_SECOND; do python3 feedbot.py; done`. If your system uses `systemd`, you can check [this](/1EiMAqhd6sMjPG2tznkkGXxhdwFBDdeqT9/?Post:24:ZeroNet+Systemd+Service+and+Timer).\n    The script normally won't fetch anything if there are no new content. But some websites don't support `etag` and `last-modified header`, the script has to always fetch feeds from them, but still won't update anything.\n\n5.  If you want to create a ZeroTalk group like [P2P news flow](/Talk.ZeroNetwork.bit/?Topics:1_1KbV1e1u6P6AsY8XNBydgtbtN8iSB5WMyG/P2P+news+flow), you can edit `/path/to/your/zerotalk/data/users/YOUR_AUTH_ADDRESS/data.json` and add `\"type\": \"group\",` to a topic you created, also copy the `topic_id`, uncomment `#'parent_topic_uri': 'TOPIC_ID' + '_' + AUTH_ADDRESS` in the feedbot.py and change `TOPIC_ID` respectively.\n\n## Bugs and Troubleshooting:\n\n### 1\\. The script sometimes hangs up.\n\nOfficial `feedparser` package [doesn't support timeout setting](https://github.com/kurtmckee/feedparser/pull/80), so you need to install it from another branch. How to:\n\n1.  Uninstall the package if you've installed it: `$ pip uninstall feedparser`.\n2.  Clone the branch with timeout function and install it (Default is 30 seconds, check [this](https://github.com/kurtmckee/feedparser/pull/80)): `$ git clone https://github.com/JPFrancoia/feedparser && cd feedparser && python3 setup.py install --user`\n\nNote: There is another solution by using `requests` library instead [[1]](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9772691/feedparser-with-timeout) [[2]](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27621689/not-getting-a-304-response-even-after-adding-etag-header), I will check it later^TM if I have time.\n\n## Todo^TM:\n\n*   Remove posts with keyword\n*   Set limit of post size\n*   Any recommendation?\n\n## License:\n\nMIT"

For HD screen the ratio is 16:9, the default max width of thumb in my gallery is 400px, so I set it to 225 = 400/16*9, and set `max-width` to 400px.\n*   Set `margin` and `padding` to 0 so there is not gap between grids.\n*   Set `float` to left or they won't line up correctly, set `overflow` to hidden so the image won't exceed the grid.\n*   `transition`, `transform` and `z-index` are animation related. [[ref.]](http://www.journaldev.com/6689/css3-zoom-image-animation-effect-on-hover)\n\nFor image:\n\n*   Set `position` to absolute, `left`, `right`, `top`, `bottom` to -200px and `max-height`, `max-width` to none, so images will be in the center of grid, and also fill the whole grid if the ratio of image isn't higher than 16:9 or lower than 1:1."

So the language sorting function will be like:\n\n1.  Article posted in sub-forum will be tagged with that language (also it will be displayed in the main forum).\n2.  User who posts article in main forum will be suggested to add a language tag or choose it from list.\n3.  User who doesn't add a language tag will be auto-sorted with script.\n4.  Limit Unicode Range usage in sub-forum, to prevent user from posting with other language.\n\nFrom [Wikipedia: UTF-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8)\nThe UTF-8 code catagory for different language is basically like:\n\n| Size | Unicode Range | Character Name | Relative Languages or States |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1-byte | U+0000..U+007F | ASCII (Hindu‚ÄìArabic numerals, Latin...) | English |\n| 2-byte | U+0080..U+00FF | Latin-1 | Major: French, German, Spanish, Icelandic, Vietnamese |\n| ... | U+0100..U+036F | *Latin Extended, etc. | ... |\n| ... | U+0370..U+03FF | Greek and Coptic | Greek |\n| ... | U+0400..U+04FF | Cyrillic | Major: Russian, Belorussian, Bulgarian, Abkhasian, Serbian |\n| ... | U+0500..U+052F | *Cyrillic Supplement | ... |\n| ... | U+0530..U+058F | *Armenian | Armenian |\n| ... | U+0590..U+05FF | Hebrew | Hebrew |\n| ... | U+0600..U+06FF | Arabic | Arabic |\n| ... | U+0700..U+074F | *Syriac | ... |\n| ... | U+0750..U+077F | *Arabic Supplement | Pakistan, Africa, old Persian, etc |\n| ... | U+0780..U+07BF | *Thaana | Maldives |\n| ... | U+07C0..U+07FF | *NKo | West Africa |\n| 3-byte | U+0800..U+3040 | *Indic, Latin Extended, etc. | ... |\n| ... | U+3041..U+30FF | Kana | Japanese, Okinawan, Ainu, Palauan |\n| ... | U+3100..U+4DFF | *Hangul Compatibility Jamo, Enclosed CJK Letters and Months, etc. | ... |\n| ... | U+4E00..U+9FFF | CJK Unified Ideographs | China, Hong Kong, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam |\n| ... | U+A000..U+ABFF | *Asian, Hangul Jamo Extended, etc. | ... |\n| ... | U+AC00..U+D7AF | Hangul Syllables | Korean |\n| ... | U+D7B0..U+FFFF | *Hangul Jamo Extended, Private Use Area, etc. | ... |\n| 4-byte | U+10000..U+10FFFF | *Emoji, Smiley, Language from other planet, etc. | ... |\n\nSo the script will be like:\n\n```\nif (the_text.match(/[\\u0370-\\u03FF]/) {\n  console.log('It\\'s Greek');\n  // Sort it to...\n} else if (the_text.match(/[\\u0400-\\u04FF]/) {\n  console.log('It\\'s Cyrillic');\n  // Sort it to...\n} else if (the_text.match(/[\\u0590-\\u05FF]/) {\n  console.log('It\\'s Hebrew');\n  // Sort it to...\n} else if (the_text.match(/[\\u0600-\\u06FF]/) {\n  console.log('It\\'s Arabic');\n  // Sort it to...\n} else if (the_text.match(/[\\u3041-\\u30FF]/) {\n  console.log('It\\'s Kana');\n  // Sort it to...\n} else if (the_text.match(/[\\uAC00-\\uD7AF]/) {\n  console.log('It\\'s Hangul');\n  // Sort it to...\n} else if (the_text.match(/[\\u4E00-\\u9FFF]/) {\n  console.log('It\\'s CJK Unified Ideographs');\n  // Sort it to...\n} else {\n  console.log('It\\'s likely latin.');\n  // Sort it to...\n}\n```\n\nPS: Python has a library named [langid](https://github.com/saffsd/langid.py) that can be used to detect many languages.

			"body": "Another python script :3 This script gives you the power to cross post between ZeroMe and Mastodon, which means when you post something on ZeroMe, it will also post to your Mastodon account, and vice versa.\n\nWhat is Mastodon? It's a Twitter-like, that based on OStatus protocol, distributed social network, and recently its user base and development are exploding. For more information check [its github repository](https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon/).\n\n## Screenshot:\n\n[Screenshot](/Me.ZeroNetwork.bit/merged-ZeroMe/1oranGeS2xsKZ4jVsu9SVttzgkYXu4k9v/data/users/1AWwhg4EiWAVttfQboJZ4wJfX3WawfJT3h/1493424295.jpg)\n![Bildschirmfoto_2017-04-28_23-03-49.png (24x24)](data/img/post_23_Bildschirmfoto_2017-04-28_23-03-49.png)\n\n## How to Install - ZeroMe Mastodon Bridge:\n\nUnlike Feedbot.py, this time the installation is quite simple. First you need to have an account from [a Mastodon instance](https://github.com/tootsuite/documentation/blob/master/Using-Mastodon/List-of-Mastodon-instances.md). Then create a folder named `ZeroMeMastodonBridge` under your ZeroNet root directory (Or simply use the FeedBot folder if you have created one):\n`$ cd /path/to/zeronet && mkdir ZeroMeMastodonBridge`\nDownload [the script file ‚Üó](https://git.gnu.io/chbinnc/binchan-s-messy-repo/raw/master/ZeroMeMastodonBridge/zerome_mastodon_bridge.py) or [copy it from Nullpaste](/1MgHVPCE1ve6QfKrgsqCURzRj72HrRWioz/?user_binchan2@zeroid.bit) to the folder, then install dependent packages `html2text` and `Mastodon.py` like with `$ pip install html2text --user && pip install Mastodon.py --user`. That's all.\n\nRun the script with `$ python zerome_mastodon_bridge.py`, just at the first time it will ask you to input your hub `address`, ID `auth_address`, ID `auth_privatekey` (you can find them in the `users.json`) and your Mastodon instance website address, your username and password of your Mastodon account.\n\nYou can keep repeating the script with `$ while sleep TIME_INTERVAL_IN_SECOND; do python zerome_mastodon_bridge.py; done`.\n\nPS: The script also supports to set last timestamps without cross-posting anything, with command: `$ cd /path/to/zeronet/ZeroMeMastodonBridge && python -c 'from zeronet_mastodon_bridge import initGlobalName, setLastTimestamp; initGlobalName(); setLastTimestamp()'`\n\n## How to Install - ZeroMe Gnusocial Bridge:\n\nThe process is similar to \"ZeroMe Mastodon Bridge\", but in addition you need to create an\naccess token dict: First register an OAuth client applicant from Settings -> Connections, then check [https://pythonhosted.org/gnusocial/oauth.html](https://pythonhosted.org/gnusocial/oauth.html) to get the access_token dict. Finally copy & paste the dict when running the script at the first time. [Script file ‚Üó](https://git.gnu.io/chbinnc/binchan-s-messy-repo/raw/master/ZeroMeMastodonBridge/zerome_gnusocial_bridge.py)\n\nFor Markdown support, add [this](https://git.gnu.io/chimo/markdown), and enable it in Settings.\n\n## Bugs and Troubleshooting:\n\n1.  Currently Mastodon doesn't support markdown, so your post from ZeroMe to Mastodon won't be well formatted. But in contrast post from Mastodon to ZeroMe will be formatted, thanks to `html2text`, though it may still have some bugs. Also Mastodon limits post to 500 characters by default.\n\n## Todo^TM:\n\n*   Image support is possible ...\n*   ZeroMe API\n\n## License:\n\nMIT\n\n## A Small Proposal:\n\nCurrently ZeroMe still has not many users (though I also like small community), and most hubs have quite heavy limit to content size. But I believe ZeroMe is still quite a promising project . Besides keep improving performance and adding functions, similiar to using same protocol like traditional email service, Diaspora* with Friendica (Friendica also supports connecting to many other websites, before it could also hack Facebook, but later Facebook built some high wall...) and Hubzilla, Mastodon with StatusNet, Gnusocial and Quitter. In the long term it may be better that ZeroMe and ZeroNet can communicate with other distributed (social) network, or just P2P (social) network. Therefore ZeroMe and ZeroNet project won't become an isolated island."

			"body": "This is a python script that will turn a ZeroMe Profile into a RSS feed reader.\n\n> RSS (Rich Site Summary; originally RDF Site Summary; often called Really Simple Syndication) uses a family of standard web feed formats to publish frequently updated information: blog entries, news headlines, audio, video. An RSS document (called \"feed\", \"web feed\", or \"channel\") includes full or summarized text, and metadata, like publishing date and author's name. [Src:Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS)\n\n[How to Subscribe to RSS Feeds](http://rss-tutorial.com/rss-how-to-subscribe-to-feeds.htm)\n\n## How to Install:\n\n1.  Backup your `/path/to/zeronet/data/users.json`, delete it and restart ZeroNet. Create a new ID (ZeroID, [KaffieID](/id.kaffie.bit/), etc).\n    Clone a hub (**Don't mess up existing hub, newcomers will be disappointed when they find only Robots and Zombies in the public timeline. Also you can control your post storage limit with your own hub, or suffer this `content.json: Include too large 277327 > 50000 ... Sign failed: Invalid content` XD**), then login ZeroMe with your new ID and your hub.\n\n2.  Create a folder named `FeedBot` under your ZeroNet root directory:\n    `$ cd /path/to/zeronet && mkdir FeedBot`\n    Download [the script file ‚Üó](https://git.gnu.io/chbinnc/Userscripts/raw/master/FeedBot/feedbot.py) or [copy it from Nullpaste](/1MgHVPCE1ve6QfKrgsqCURzRj72HrRWioz/?user_binchan2@zeroid.bit) to the folder, also under `FeedBot` folder create an empty file named with `rssAddresses.txt`.\n\n    PS: One-line command: `$ cd /path/to/zeronet && mkdir FeedBot && cd FeedBot && touch rssAddresses.txt && wget https://git.gnu.io/chbinnc/Userscripts/raw/master/FeedBot/feedbot.py`\n\n3.  Add your feeds:\n    There are two way to add your feeds:\n    One way is to directly copy your feed url to `rssAddresses.txt`, one url one line.\n    The other way is to create post with your bot ZeroMe account. The format is `add-feed YOUR_FEED_URL`. Your can also delete your feed with `del-feed URL`. That's cool, isn't it ;) You can also use your major ZeroMe account to add and delete feed url. Check the code to add the feature by yourself :P\n\n4.  Backup `/path/to/zeronet/data/users.json` (You need to copy your bot site address, id auth address and auth key later when first time running the script), restore your major `users.json` and restart ZeroNet.\n\n5.  Run the script:\n    Install package dependency `feedparser`: `$ pip install feedparser` or with other method. Then simply run it with `$ python feedbot.py`. If you want to run it periodically, you can use `$ watch -n TIME_INTERVAL_IN_SECOND -x python feedbot.py`. The script normally won't fetch anything if there are no new content. But some websites don't support `etag` and `last-modified header`, the script has to always fetch feeds from them, but still won't update anything.\n    PS: On my Raspberry pi 2 `watch` doesn't work together with `tmux`, so I use this one instead: `$ while sleep TIME_INTERVAL_IN_SECOND; do python feedbot.py; done`.\n\n## Screenshot:\n\n[Screenshot](/Me.ZeroNetwork.bit/merged-ZeroMe/1oranGeS2xsKZ4jVsu9SVttzgkYXu4k9v/data/users/1AWwhg4EiWAVttfQboJZ4wJfX3WawfJT3h/1492140736.jpg)\n![Bildschirmfoto_2017-04-14_09-42-10.png (24x24)](data/img/post_22_Bildschirmfoto_2017-04-14_09-42-10.png)\n\n## Bugs and Troubleshooting:\n\n### 1\\. The script sometimes hangs up.\n\nOfficial `feedparser` package [doesn't support timeout setting](https://github.com/kurtmckee/feedparser/pull/80), so you need to install it from another branch. How to:\n\n1.  Uninstall the package if you've installed it: `$ pip uninstall feedparser`.\n2.  Clone the branch with timeout function and install it (Default is 30 seconds, check [this](https://github.com/kurtmckee/feedparser/pull/80)): `$ git clone https://github.com/JPFrancoia/feedparser && cd feedparser && python setup.py install --user`\n\nNote: There is another solution by using `requests` library instead [[1]](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9772691/feedparser-with-timeout) [[2]](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27621689/not-getting-a-304-response-even-after-adding-etag-header), I will check it later^TM if I have time.\n\n## Todo:\n\n*   ~~Also add Feed Summary (300-500 character limit).~~\n*   Keyword filters especially for large websites.\n*   Remove posts with keyword\n*   Set limit of post size\n*   Any recommendation?\n\n## License:\n\nMIT"

			"body": "Tips to check if a zite links to clearnet:\n\n1.  Right click the page and select `inspect Element`, then under `inspector`, search page content with `http`. These are almost some static links, if you don't click them, they shouldn't cause problem, except that they are used in the javascripts. But my knowledge is limited, there may be some types of link that I miss.\n2.  Also with `inspect Element` tools, choose `Debugger`, click every js file and search page content with `#http`. Javascripts can contain lots of [traps](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/javascript-trap.html) to security and privacy, besides malware, it can use to record every interaction you do with the browser, including scrolling, clicking, typing, etc. I don't have enough study to give cases and details, but I recommend two add-ons: **Noscript** and [Librejs](https://www.gnu.org/software/librejs/). Unfortunately we need to allow the whole domain `127.0.0.1:43110` to make ZeroNet work, and when using Librejs, one script (pasted below) can't mark as whitelist and zites are totally unfunctional, but you can still add the domain to whitelist and learn what kinds of javascript it is blocking.\n\n3.  Do it again under `Stylesheet Editor` tag. Stylesheet sometimes uses outside sources like images, loading buffers. These are quite harmless, but still can use to track your Internet activities (when do you surf the website).\n\nAnything lacking? (hmm, like maybe someone also links its zite to `ftp server` )\n\nAnd a perfect workaround: [use Tor browser](http://zeronet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq/#how-to-use-zeronet-in-tor-browser) but disable `Torbutton` and `TorLauncher` add-on, then your browser will never connect to clearnet X)\n\nPS: But still... Website owner can use javascript to send your activities to clearnet website.\n\nAlso, everytime starting Icecat (another Firefox fork) it will connect to [https://check.torproject.org/](https://check.torproject.org/), I guess Torbrowser is same, if you care, maybe you can install foxyproxy addon and setup a fake proxy for it.\n\nPS2: Relative Info & link\n\n*   [Erkan@ ZeroBlog: protect yourselves: set a non-working proxy](/1HR2mJHeC1vs3XTTcX2X6BDcdRZZDNXZKV/?Post:60:protect+yourselves:+set+a+non-working+proxy)\n\n*   > \"By adding google analytics you let google to know when do you visit a site, what exactly doing there, what are you searching, who are you interacting with, whats your username etc. Otherwise this none of this information will be leaked anywhere.\" [Source](/Talk.ZeroNetwork.bit/?Topic:2_1DFDjUGJdSp1kMuFq1AtNS9ZWmkVtbp947)\n\n```\n# Script that can't mark as whitelist\n\nNONTRIVIAL: innerHTML identifier\n\ndocument.getElementById(\"inner-iframe\").src = \"about:blank\"\ndocument.getElementById(\"inner-iframe\").src = \"\\/1EiMAqhd6sMjPG2tznkkGXxhdwFBDdeqT9\\/\\?wrapper_nonce\\=4c208d3bd54159651e6e38f1f0fe7fbb128e4d81a39551d4319a826dadc66dd3\"\naddress = \"1EiMAqhd6sMjPG2tznkkGXxhdwFBDdeqT9\"\nwrapper_nonce = \"4c208d3bd54159651e6e38f1f0fe7fbb128e4d81a39551d4319a826dadc66dd3\"\nwrapper_key = \"ae3b0071b41099815adf03de668d274981f59c9d45d2abdca38b8126916e0f75\"\npostmessage_nonce_security = true\nfile_inner_path = \"index.html\"\npermissions = []\nshow_loadingscreen = false\nserver_url = ''\n\nif (typeof WebSocket === \"undefined\")\ndocument.body.innerHTML += \"\n\n<div class=\"unsupported\">Your browser is not supported please use [Chrome or Firefox](http://outdatedbrowser.com).</div>\n\n\";\n```"

At least it works for me with Icecat.\n\nFinal step is to convert it to pdf, so you can even enjoy it with an E-ink reader. I'm using Archlinux, and I install `wkhtmltopdf` and convert the profile with the command below:\n`$ wkhtmltopdf -s A4 --allow WEBSITE_OFFLINE_DATA_FOLDER WEBSITE.htm output.pdf`\nA4 is fine for me, because the width of tweet don't fill the whole page.

It is handcrafted, and only officially supports Windows, but we know that every device theoretically and practically supports GNU/Linux :3\n\nWhen I plugged it by usb, well, the backlight looked ok, but the keys couldn't output anything. After some search and log checking, I found that from `$ usb-devices` the device doesn't have driver.\n\n```\nT:  Bus=03 Lev=01 Prnt=01 Port=01 Cnt=01 Dev#=  4 Spd=1.5 MxCh= 0\nD:  Ver= 1.10 Cls=ff(vend.)

Kept searching, attempting, finally [solved the matching problem](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/442833/forcing-driver-to-device-match) by\n\n```\n## 4242 is VendorID, babe is ProdID\n# 'echo 4242 babe >/sys/bus/usb/drivers/usbhid/new_id'\n```\n\nAnd the keyboard functions now \\o/\n`$ usb-devices`\n\n```\nI:  If#= 0 Alt= 0 #EPs= 2 Cls=03(HID  ) Sub=01 Prot=01 Driver=usbhid\n```\n\n`$ tree /sys/bus/usb/drivers/usbhid`\n\n```\n/sys/bus/usb/drivers/usbhid\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 3-2:1.0 -> ../../../../devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:14.0/usb3/3-2/3-2:1.0\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ bind\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ module -> ../../../../module/usbhid\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ new_id\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ remove_id\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ uevent\n‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ unbind\n```\n\nBut it's still not perfect. Sometimes the backlight suddenly doesn't flash correctly and the keys have no reaction again. Check `$ dmesg` and search online, the problem may be from [usb autosuspend](https://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=798663), but currently [solutions](https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=199504) don't work in my case.\n\nI also try to add an udev rule to auto-match the keyboard and driver\n\n```\n#/etc/udev/rules.d/99-osu-kbd.rules\nSUBSYSTEM==\"usb\", DRIVERS==\"usbhid\", ATTR{idVendor}==\"4242\", ATTR{idProduct}==\"babe\", ATTR{power/control}=\"on\"\n```\n\nDoesn't work.

			"date_published": 1482214178.485,
			"body": "[Ver 2](?Post:85)\n\n> White theme is for noob, light theme is for amateur, dark theme is for expert ;)\n\nThis userstyle has been actively polished for more than 1 year, should work on all official zites and their clones.\nMany unofficial zites are also supported, like NullPaste, ZeroWiki, Kaffiene Search, Git Center. Nevertheless, some other zites may have side effects - that some bright elements are still not changed. You can try it yourself, ask me to modify them or temporarily disable the theme.\n\nSome devs may find the way I develop this userstyle very stupid, I should be able to automate a lot of things by writing a python script, but I enjoy the procedure like playing jigsaw puzzles, and having some simple time X)\n\nCode theme is Vim Desert.\n\nFor Firefox family browser before Firefox 57, you can install it by [Stylish](https://github.com/stylish-userstyles/stylish) plugin/add-on (version 2.0.x).\nFor Chrome family browser, you can use [Stylus](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus). The Chrome version of Stylish and the Firefox version newer than 3.xx is not recommended, as it's not opensource and has [an opt-out option to collect user data](https://malwaretips.com/threads/stylish-browser-add-on-2-million-users-impacted-by-new-data-collection-policy.67191/), and I confirm that even I uncheck the data collection option, every time I start Inox (an ungoogled Chromium) it will connect to google-analytics. Even so use a firefox family browser if you care your privacy.\n\nCurrently Stylus Beta is available for Firefox 57, but in my Firefox ([Iceweasel](https://wiki.parabola.nu/Iceweasel), Debian's rebranded version), it doesn't work for ZeroNet. There is another add-on called [xStyle](https://github.com/FirefoxBar/xStyle) but it doesn't work, too... So for now there is no solution for Firefox 57.\n\n## How to install:\n\nIf you use Firefox (version < 57) and Stylish 2.xx, in the `Manage Styles` Setting you can choose `Install from URLs`, then simply copy [this link](/1EiMAqhd6sMjPG2tznkkGXxhdwFBDdeqT9/shared/zeronet-dark-theme-next.userstyle.css) and install it (for NullPaste bin it doesn't work in this way).\n\nIf you use Stylus, under `Manage` page, use `Import styles` and import [this file](/1EiMAqhd6sMjPG2tznkkGXxhdwFBDdeqT9/shared/zeronet-dark-theme-for-import.json), then click the update button to update it to the lastet version. You can also set up auto-update interval under `Options UI`.\n\nIf you use remote server mode or clearnet proxy and your ZeroNet address is not `127.0.0.1:43110`, you need to change the addresses below in the json file.\n\n```\n...\n    \"updateUrl\": \"http://127.0.0.1:43110/1EiMAqhd6sMjPG2tznkkGXxhdwFBDdeqT9/shared/zeronet-dark-theme.userstyle.json\",\n    \"md5Url\": \"http://127.0.0.1:43110/1EiMAqhd6sMjPG2tznkkGXxhdwFBDdeqT9/shared/zeronet-dark-theme.userstyle.md5\",\n    \"url\": \"http://127.0.0.1:43110/1EiMAqhd6sMjPG2tznkkGXxhdwFBDdeqT9/?Post:3:A+Dark+Theme+For+ZeroNet\",\n...\n```\n\nIn another way you can create a new theme and choose import Mozilla Format from the left panel, then copy & paste the content of [this link](/1EiMAqhd6sMjPG2tznkkGXxhdwFBDdeqT9/shared/zeronet-dark-theme-next.userstyle.css), but you need to manually repeat these steps for update.\n\n## Screenshot:\n\n![Bildschirmfoto_2016-12-16_10-28-46.png (24x24)](/1EiMAqhd6sMjPG2tznkkGXxhdwFBDdeqT9/data/img/post_3_Bildschirmfoto_2016-12-16_10-28-46.png)\n\n![Bildschirmfoto_2017-01-06_14-16-31.png (24x24)](/1EiMAqhd6sMjPG2tznkkGXxhdwFBDdeqT9/data/img/post_3_Bildschirmfoto_2017-01-06_14-16-31.png)\n\nMore screenshot at [My Jekyll Zite](/1ADGCZCvC6wCf5GwCY23H9uwKyRiixoLt6/photos/dark_theme/)\n\n## Other sources:\n\n[My repo](/13zzNGxEXDeLxHEGZdG3mE7G8dChf45LrV) on Git Center. You can track the update log, submit issue and make request there.\n[repository on git.gnu.io](https://git.gnu.io/chbinnc/binchan-s-messy-repo/tree/master/Userstyles)\n[my gallery](/1ADGCZCvC6wCf5GwCY23H9uwKyRiixoLt6/zeronet-dark-theme.userstyle.css) (Unmaintained, too lazy to update it :3)\n[my NullPaste bin](/1MgHVPCE1ve6QfKrgsqCURzRj72HrRWioz/?user_binchan2@zeroid.bit) (Unmaintained, too lazy to update it :3)\n[userstyle.org](https://userstyles.org/styles/136470/zeronet-dark-theme) (Unmaintained, easy to install but the website contains many third-party javascripts)\n\nHope you enjoy it :)"

			"date_published": 1482207158.095,
			"body": "My ZeroNet Node (Version 0.5.1 rev1781) is on a raspberry pi 2, system ArchlinuxARM (been long time not update), run quite smooth. I also tried to install it on a pi 1, but failed. Why? Not interested in looking into those logs anymore ~ Because I have a working machine now :3\n\nI start zeronet from tmux with `$ python2 /path/to/zeronet/zeronet.py --ui_ip MY_Local_static_ip`\nTo setup a static ip, I also go to router control panel to lock the ip for my pi.\n\nTry to add `--ui_restrict` argument, but failed, log said \"too few arguments\".\n\n*   [setup temporary python2 env](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Python#Python_2), start with `$ /path/to/zeronet/zeronet.py`, failed.\n*   `$ grep -rin /path/to/zeronet/src/ -e ui_restr`, the argument mainly locates at `/Ui/UiRequest.py:45:` and `/Config.py:144:`.\n    The culprit seems from Config.py: `nargs='*'`. Add `--trackers` arguments report same problem. Reference [official docs](https://docs.python.org/2/library/argparse.html),\n    [add](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28032916/python-command-line-too-few-arguments) `#!/usr/bin/env python` at the top of `Config.py`, same,\n    change `nargs='*'` to `nargs='+'`, same ...\n    delete `nargs='*'`, ok, now I can add one restricted ip. But I have multiple devices.\n    So finally I directly added my ips in `/Ui/UiRequest.py`:\n\n    ```diff\n    -if config.ui_restrict and self.env['REMOTE_ADDR'] not in config.ui_restrict:\n    +if self.env['REMOTE_ADDR'] not in [ip1, ip2, ip3]:\n    ```\n\n    delete `/Ui/UiRequest.pyc`and restart zeronet, guess it work ~\n\nPS: Finally find a [perfect solution](https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/296), 'too few arguments' is because that last argument should not be multi-parameter. So changing the command to `$ python2 /path/to/zeronet/zeronet.py --ui_retrict ip1 ip2 --ui_ip MY_Local_static_ip` does the magic \\o/\n\nOther Issues:\n\n1.  Port 15441 shows 'Close' on ZeroHello, re-check opened port failed, log also reported failed. But... UPnP successfully open a 15441 port for ZeroNet and my pi ip,\n    using port forwarding, same.\n    `$ netstat -tuplen`:\n    `tcp 0 0 0.0.0.0:15441 0.0.0.0:* LISTEN 1000 4065805 17384/python2.7`\n    Anyway, I can seed my local website to clearnet proxy, so, enough ...\n\n    *   PS: someone mentioned that the port may be forbidden at ISP level.\n2.  ZeroMail always has one file that updates failed.\n    Solution: from [ZeroMail zite](/Mail.ZeroNetwork.bit/) Control panel (drag the right menu icon to left to open it) or from file `/path/to/zeronet/data/sites.json`, I can find the corrupted file name, in my case it's `$MAIL_ZITE_PATH/data/users/1DSKBQLWoFjHWt922n6ez2PxYTb3CvfeRJ/content.json`, the file doesn't exist in my local storage, but there is `data.json`, so I directly delete the folder `1DSKBQLWoFjHWt922n6ez2PxYTb3CvfeRJ`, check files of and update ZeroMail, and it works ~ Interestingly in [NullPaste](/1MgHVPCE1ve6QfKrgsqCURzRj72HrRWioz/) there is also a file that fails to update. It's a `data.json` file and in local only a `content.json` file exists. The method above works again ~ Guess that's enough to tell something.\n\n    *   PS: someone mentioned that deleting part of the zite will corrupt the database. I need further study about it.\n    *   PS2: For own zite, a solution from someone:\n\n        > Those 1 file errors are annoying. The most effective way I found to get rid of them is going to the content.json and removing all the file links with sha512 (resetting to \"files\": {},). Afterwards I resign and boom the error goes away. :D\n\n3.  Enable UiPassword plugin, but with `--ui_password` ZeroBlog didn't render correctly, ZeroHello later totally didn't show anything. Maybe had something to do with browser cache. Didn't test further ...\n\n    *   PS: someone [mentioned that](/Me.ZeroNetwork.bit/?Post/12h51ug6CcntU2aiBjhP8Ns2e5VypbWWtv/1GnJD7CXskmG8GywMbTvbP12wneCFW9XzR/1483533203) password is transferred over insecure HTTP protocol, so it's not secure. They also mentioned a better solution:\n\n        > Alternatively, you can just start ZeroNet on remote machine as normal, without --ui_ip, UiPassword, reverse proxy, SSL, etc.\n        > And run this command at local machine:\n        > `ssh -L 43110:127.0.0.1:43110 -N username@remote`\n        > Then you can just access [http://127.0.0.1:43110/](http://127.0.0.1:43110/) on your local machine, securely.\n\n4.  ...
