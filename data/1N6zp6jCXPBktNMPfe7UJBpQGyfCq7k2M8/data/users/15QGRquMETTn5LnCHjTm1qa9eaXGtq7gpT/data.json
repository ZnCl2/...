At the heart could be something like a custom distro of linux with the above software pre-installed, and configured to jump into a new or existing meshnet. The software would run on a cheap pocket computer, like the Raspberry Pi\n\nMy thoughts exactly. Man doesn't need a state-of-the-art quad-core machine with bloated-ass software to get networking. All that is needed is some form of P2P connection (I'm thinking meshnets here, but really it could even be bluetooth or infrared) and a platform for P2P computing. To hell with centralized services and the notion of digital property. Sharing and distribution are the future!\n",
