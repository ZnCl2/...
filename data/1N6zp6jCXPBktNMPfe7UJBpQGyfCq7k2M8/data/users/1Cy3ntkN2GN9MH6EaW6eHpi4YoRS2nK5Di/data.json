For instance, I've added Name.YO to ZeroSites just now with description being 'A free, if centralized, domain name provider', but Kaffiene says it's 'A free if centralized domain name provider' which makes a lot less sense.\n- It says '---- peers' for almost every site. I understand why that happens, but this is not very user-friendly. Maybe remove '---- peers' altogether if the peer count is unknown or collect that count manually (via a script)?\n- It'd be great to sort the search results by popularity (ZeroSites stars, at least). When I search 'ZeroMe' the real ZeroMe is the third from the end.",

			"body": "> [kaffie](#comment_71_1NWh3WAty57FH8at1WtrZigMrdhrDkuPzh): Yeah, I've been meaning to replace them but I don't really know of any active proxies.\n\nThere's 0net-preview.com, but it doesn't allow adding new sites. Still useful. This is the only online public proxy I'm aware of. There are also a few other proxies I found via a way I'm not going to disclose because they look like someone's accidentally open private nodes.\n\n> Though I couldn't figure out how to sort by stars.\n\nI still think it'd be better to sort by stars, because it's too easy to fake site addition date.",
