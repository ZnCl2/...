I notice in the Sidebar for hubs there is an option **DOWNLOAD AND HELP DISTRIBUTE ALL FILES**, currently turned off. Do I need to turn that on? Or would that be overkill?\n(And it being off for all hubs, is that a possible reason why I ran out of space so quickly on my current home hub?)",

E.g. when a user hits their limit, the site owner is presented with a button \"Set this user's limit to 200KB\".",

Unless third parties become able to remove limits on zites they don't own, which would bring in a whole slew of problems of its own.",
