I thought I had done everything right, but I've only been able to get to the point where my posts will say \"not tagged\" even though I put in values for tags in the data.json file. Any ideas? I'd really appreciate the help: The blog I created is http://127.0.0.1:43110/1D1Lh4JF2k8n5DtyB98bnxXnJWRR1pw5GB/",

If all the javascript/html is working, and the content is being put into the data.json file, then the issue is likely that you didn't update your dbschema.\n> Be sure to refresh your javascript page so that your browser gets the update to the js file. And make sure all the files have been changed: dbschema, data.json, index.html, and all.js.\n\nHmm, I thought I had done so correctly. I modified each of the files you listed, so I probably left something out of one of them that I didn't notice. Thanks for your help. I'll give it another go when I get a bit more time.",
