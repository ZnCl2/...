But it really just ends up pointing people to ZeroBoard which sucks, and ZeroTalk, where people ask for something like this page.\n> As for a search engine, ZeroSearch isn't really all that great. It was made a few months ago, and doesn't have the newer sites. The dev apparently has to add them manually after people submit requests. So in the mean time, I'm cloning it and seeing if I can make something more usable. We'll see how that goes.\n\nYou're doing god's work man. We need more stuff like this.",
