Survive, thrive, evolve, improve, enhance.\n\nIndeed, as the stoics said, we have to \"live by our nature\", it's the only way according to them, this includes a lot of \"common sense\"\n\nI think you would enjoy the Crash Course Philosophy video series, very thoughtful videos (clearnet) : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1A_CAkYt3GY&list=PL8dPuuaLjXtNgK6MZucdYldNkMybYIHKR\n\nI wish I would have time for a bigger post but I'm a bit in a rush right now, maybe I'll post later some more thoughts after reading at ease :)",
