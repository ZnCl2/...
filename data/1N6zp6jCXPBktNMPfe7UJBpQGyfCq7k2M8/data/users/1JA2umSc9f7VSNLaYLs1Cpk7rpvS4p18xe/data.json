If that improves the overall search environment of ZeroNet, then mission accomplished.\n\nIn the end, quality will come out over quantity. \nI have no doubts that Kaffiene will continue to attract lots of users, as long as you keep it the way you do now.\nOf course, posting big numbers looks good - but when getting duplicate results, I personally look for the search engine that has the least redundancies and works the best.",

			"body": "Hey, there you go! I really like the new interface, it looks familiar (even though I haven't been using Google for a long while, now) and feels right, especially with the tag highlighting and the fancier, but still minimal enough buttons. \n\nAs for having a \"smaller\" index than ZeroSearch, I wouldn't worry too much about that. Quality over quality, definitely and as soon as you manage to work on a crawler that feeds into Kaffiene,  you will have  a definite advantage over the competition, even if they boast big numbers. \n\nA problem that some users may encounter, though, is not knowing that the checkbox next to the search bar is used for enabling clickable tags, you may want to give a small hint on that somewhere.\n\nAs always, I like the way Kaffiene is taking and what is continuing to happen with the competition between Kaffiene and the other search engines (with a glaring exception).\n\nThis is mostly healthy competition, and sharing is definitely key in such a transparent system as ZeroNet is.",
