			"body": "I like the idea, and actually was toying around with creating a tiny computer using Raspberry Pi Zero that you could plug into any HDMI display, plug in your own microSD and away you go. When done, pull your microSD, and you can hand off the computer to someone else and it would be just like any other. The Zero is only $5, and the other periphery you would need to make it work would run you under $50 if you sourced them right.\n\nI would see a huge benefit to this, even if only a handful of people used them, and even if they still used the Internet for some things. You don't need all of society to switch 100% to disrupt the establishment. When American Independence was declared, only 3% of colonists fought against the British soldiers. The rest either were loyal to the crown or didn't care. 3% is all it takes to bring the machine to its knees.",
